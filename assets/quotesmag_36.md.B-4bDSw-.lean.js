Life He was son of Thomas Richmond, originally of Bawtry, and of an old Yorkshire family. His father was 'groom of the stables' to the Duke of Gloucester, and afterwards the proprietor of the Coach and Horses at Kew, where the artist was born in 1771. His mother, Ann Bone, was a cousin of George Engleheart, 'miniature-painter to the king.' Thomas became Engleheart's pupil, and was employed by the royal family in copying miniatures by his master and Richard Cosway. He also copied in miniature size many of the portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds in the royal collection. His original and unsigned miniatures are numerous. Some are on ivory, others are on paper, and in many cases full or half length, with the head in colours and the rest in pencil. Though the pose of some of his figures is in the stiff manner usual at the time, the portraits are lifelike, and the drawing and expression excellent. In later years Richmond lived in the centre of fashion, 42 Half-Moon Street, Mayfair. From 1795 to 1825 he exhibited forty-six miniatures at the Royal Academy. One of his miniatures, a portrait of his wife (Ann Oram), painted in 1808, was engraved by William Holl, jun. His eldest son, also named Thomas Richmond, was born in 1802. His younger son, George Richmond, inherited many of his works. Both of his children also became noted artists. He died in 1837, and was buried in Paddington churchyard. He lies in the large western section changed into a public park (St Marys Gardens) in 1881.

He was venerated as a Christian saint, and his memorial day was 19 April. Saint Werner's Chapel in Oberwesel on the Rhine was established in 1289 and became a popular pilgrimage site. His veneration prompted other allegations against Jews, such as Host desecration and ritual murder. Background Born in 1271 in Womrath, Hunsr√ºck, Werner came from a poor background. On Maundy Thursday 1287, his body was found near Bacharach. Certain Christians blamed his murder on the Jews, claiming that they had used his blood for the Jewish ritual of Passover (the blood libel against Jews). Similar anti-Jewish legends were widely circulated in the Middle Ages. The alleged murder was followed by a wave of pogroms against the Jewish community. Violence spread from the Middle Rhine to the Moselle and the Lower Rhine region. The Jewish community turned to King Rudolf I, who was convinced the accusations were groundless. He fined the murderers of Jews and ordered the burning of the corpse of Werner to prevent any further veneration. Veneration Saint Werner's Chapel, Bacharach, from 1289 \\"Views of the Rhine\\" by William Tombleson (1840), ruins of Saint Werner's Chapel, Bacharach (Rhine romanticism). The royal instructions to burn Werner's body, to prevent any further veneration, were not followed. Werner was buried on 30 April 1287 and alleged miracles began to be reported as the veneration spread as a martyr cult. The Cunibert Chapel in Bacharach was expanded beginning in 1289 to become the present Saint Werner's Chapel. The planned expansion of the chapel into a large church remained unfinished after 1338. A further construction also failed owing to the decline of the veneration of martyrs and shrinking revenue to the church from pilgrims. The 1338 Latin legend alleges the Jews hung Werner by his feet. Then they had him thrown into the Rhine. At the point in Bacharach where the body was supposedly washed ashore, Saint Werner's Chapel was built. A second sanctuary was built in the Chapel of the Holy Spirit Hospital of Oberwesel, 7 kilometers downstream. Count Palatine Ludwig III aspired to a revival of the cult. Attempts towards Canonisation were made 1426-1429 , the chapel was finally completed. After 1548 some of the relics were transferred to Besan√ßon, spreading the Werner mythology. Although the chapel was destroyed in the 17th century, Werner was venerated in the Diocese of Trier until 1963. In iconography, Werner is depicted with a sickle as well as a shovel and pan. He has been acknowledged as a patron saint of winemakers. Contemporary attitudes Saint Werner's Chapel, Womrath Saint Werner's Chapel, Oberwesel In 1963, Werner was removed from the calendar of the Diocese of Trier, but \\"Saint Werner of Oberwesel\\" still appears in German directories of saints. The chapel dedicated to him alongside the town wall facing the Rhine, which had been in ruins, was later renovated, and a plaque added, with a quotation from Pope John XXIII, recognizing the brotherhood of Christians and Jews, and asking for forgiveness for \\"the curse that we unrightfully affixed to the Jews‚Äô name.\\" See also *Blood Libel *The Prioress Tale *Andreas Oxner *Saint Gabriel of Bia≈Çystok *Harold of Gloucester *Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln *Robert of Bury *Simon of Trent *William of Norwich  References  * * Jeffrey L.

Wenchang Wang is physically represented by a constellation of six stars near the Big Dipper. The stars all had names of their own: Shangjiang (), Cijiang (), Guixiang (), Siming (), Sizhong (), and Silu (). Wenchang Wang is often depicted as an elderly scholar accompanied by two attendants, Tianlong ( or Heaven-Deaf) and Diya ( or Earth-Mute).Christie, Anthony. Chinese Mythology. Hamlyn House, 1968 p.56 He has historically been called upon by scholars and writers who need inspiration or help right before an exam.  Story  There are quite a few accounts of Wenchang Wang; most depict him as a man by the name Zhang Yazi (), of a county in Sichuan Province called Zitong. A particular account cites him as a war hero, having died an honorable death in a rebellion against Emperor F√∫ JiƒÅn in 374. Other accounts of Wenchang Wang appear rather sporadically at different time periods; he has been given seventeen reincarnations over a period of 3,000 years. A notable account of an appearance of Wenchang Wang was as the Spirit of Zitong, during the suppression of a rebellion in Chengdu, Sichuan, in 1000 A.D. A man allegedly climbed a ladder in midst of battle and declared that the Spirit of Zitong told him the \\"town [of rebels] would fall on the twentieth day of the ninth moon.\\" The town fell on the day indicated, and the general in charge of repressing the rebellion had the temple repaired.Werner, ETC ‚ÄúMyths and Legends of CHINA‚Äù Gearge G.

The Book of Emperor Zi Tong records: \\"Wenchang was had a mature mind at birth. His mother breastfed him even though she was perilously ill and malnourished. In the middle of the night, Wenchang cut flesh from his own thighs and fed it to his mother. She was then cured of her illness.\\" Wenchang Wang also appears in other texts, where he is praised for other noble virtues. The book Wenchang Emperor and the States He Stabilized states: \\"He descended into the mortal world seventy-three times as a shidafu\\" (a scholar-bureaucrat position in the emperor's government of feudal China). Wenchang was uncorrupted, upright and just, and never dealt out harsh punishments to the people. He allegedly helps people when they have hardships, saves those who are in trouble, has compassion for the lonely, forgives people's mistakes, and leaves peace and stability everywhere he goes. Because of this, the Jade Emperor put him in charge of the elections of village leaders.  Controversy  There is controversy over the actual position of Wenchang, despite common practice of attributing him to Zhang Yazi. Many point out that the stories on Zhang Yazi are attributed mainly to honor and heroism, having nothing to do with actual literature. In his Myths and Legends of China, E.T.C. Werner points out that \\"Wherever Wenchang is worshiped there will also be found a separate representation of Kui Xing, showing that while the official deity has been allowed to 'borrow glory' from the popular god, and even to assume his personality, the independent existence of the stellar spirit is nevertheless sedulously maintained.\\" The story being that Zhang Kui (Kui Xing) was a brilliant scholar who was, because of his unsightly face, not recognized by the Emperor when he passed the top examinations. Feeling dejected, he threw himself into the ocean, and ascended into the heavens as a star. Initially, scholars worshiped this star, Kui Xing, as the God of Literature, but with time, he was eventually linked to the Dipper (constellation) or Great Bear, and assimilated into Wenchang Jundi.Werner, ETC ‚ÄúMyths and Legends of CHINA‚Äù Gearge G.

Wenchang has had various titles, but was officially apotheosized by Yen Yu of the Mongol Dynasty in 1314 A.D as the Supporter of the Yuan (Mongol) Dynasty, Diffuser of Renovating Influences, Ssu-lu of Wenchang, God and Lord. He is often called upon by scholars and students for academic help. There are many different temples and shrines dedicated to worshiping Wenchang Wang, the most notable being the Wenchang temple of Zitong, located at modern-day Qiqu Mountain (). This famous mountain is both the location of the largest cypress forest in China as well as the origin of the Wenchang culture. As Sichuan (where Qiqu Mountain is located) is mainly in the south, there is a saying, \\"In the North there is Confucius and in the South there is Wenchang.\\" There are also two notable temples dedicated to worshiping Wenchang Di Jun in Taichung: one is in the Beitun District of Taichung, apparently constructed in 1863 as a means of facilitating learning in the developing groups of people there. The other temple is in the Nantun district of Taichung, built in 1825. Both temples face south, which is apparently due to a principle of feng shui. The practice of worshiping Wenchang Wang has a long history; it was popular in the past because he was allowed to be venerated by the rich and poor alike. He is still often worshiped now for essentially the same reasons. The third day of the second moon of the Chinese lunar calendar is the birthday of Wenchang. People generally celebrated his birthday by visiting his temples, the officials and scholars of the county all had to go to the Temple of Wenchang to make offerings, sacrifices or recite poems.

Advocates  Senator Robert Bennett (R-UT) Commissioner Kenneth Maryboy Council Delegate Davis Filfred Commissioner-Elect Phil Lyman Council Delegate (Ret.) Mark Maryboy  Opponents  Navajo Vice-President Ben Shelly Navajos calling themselves Descendants of K'aayelii Aneth Chapter President John Billie  Reaction  US Senator Robert Bennett's position was sympathetic to The Navajos residing in San Juan County since they are his constituents. According to him, in 2008 he had received resolutions from six of the seven Utah Navajo Chapters (the seventh chapter has fewer than fifty members residing in Utah) endorsing the idea of designating a new trustee as long as that trustee is not the Navajo Nation. The response to his question of why the Utah Navajo did not want the Navajo Nation to serve as trustee was that they believe the Navajo Nation will use the Utah Navajo Trust Fund for purposes other than what the 1933 Act and 1968 amendments require. Senator Bennett went on the state that, \\"I represent their interests as Utahns in the United States Senate and share their desire to grant them the ability to determine their own future, I agreed to work with them in resolving this problem.\\" http://indian.senate.gov/public/_files/BENNETTstatement.pdf Statement by Senator Robert F. Bennett before the Committee on Indian Affairs Local Reaction The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs heard testimony December 9, 2010 on the proposed amendment. Kenneth Maryboy, a Navajo Nation Council delegate representing Utah Navajos, testified that the Navajo Nation has previously \\"failed to be a competent trustee for Utah Navajos, Congress must not now abandon Utah Navajos by ignoring the history of neglect, unaccountability and malfeasance that the Navajo Nation continues to demonstrate,\\" said Maryboy, a member of the Board of Directors of the Utah Dineh Corporation. http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/national/81003137.html Navajo conflict aired in Senate According to San Juan County Commissioner- Elect Phil Lymann, he has stated that \\"This is an important bill for the Utah Navajos. Utah Dineh Corporation is a well established entity with tremendous potential for effectively developing one of the most underserved areas of the United States. By returning control of this asset to its owners, the Utah Navajos, Senator Bennett will effectively restore hope for real economic development on the Utah Strip of the Navajo Reservation. 100 years of handouts, coupled with tribal, state, and federal politics has certainly not done the job.\\" Navajo Nation Reaction The Vice President Ben Shelly testified that the Navajo Nation rightfully should be the trust fund trustee. He said the Navajo Nation is adamantly opposed to Senate Bill 1690. Vice President Shelly told the committee that the Navajo Nation would be an accountable, responsible, and transparent trustee in the Utah Navajo Trust Fund. He said \\"that in the 30 years of administrating the current Utah Navajo Trust Fund, the Navajo Nation has never breached its fiduciary responsibility to the trust fund.\\" http://www.navajo.org/News%20Releases/George%20Hardeen/Dec09/091209vp_Navajo%20Vice%20President%20testifies%20to%20have%20Nation%20administer%20Utah%20Trust%20Fund,%20for%20Dec.%209,%202009.pdf Navajo Vice President Ben Shelly testifies against bill See also * United States Senate * Utah Dineh Corporation * Navajo Nation * Navajo people  References  External links * http://www.museumstuff.com/learn/topics/Senate_Bill_1690 Category:San Juan County, Utah Category:Proposed legislation of the 111th United States Congress ","title":"Senate Bill 1690"},{"id":"29627473","text":"Um, Uh Oh (2011) is the seventh full-length album by Say Hi and was released on January 25, 2011.Barsuk Records On November 16, 2010, \\"Devils\\" was released as an exclusive download on Spin.comSpin.com and for purchase on iTunes.

As described in The Harvard Dictionary of Music: \\"The ojkanje is a particular style of singing melisma with a sharp and prolonged shaking of the voice on the syllables oj or hoj.\\" According to experts, ojkanje is a remnant of pre-Slavic Illyrian singing from the area of ancient Dalmatia (today's Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro.) In 2010, it was inscribed as Ojkanje singing in UNESCOs List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding. Geographical extent Historically, ojkanje is found in the regions of the Dalmatian hinterland, Velebit, Lika, Kordun, and Karlovac, belonging to the Dinaric area, along with several neighbouring micro-regions. Dalmatian hinterland area is consider as main home of the ojkanje style and from there was expanded to other parts of Croatia. Migrations from the Dinaric region during the 16th and 17th century probably introduced this style of singing to Adriatic islands as well migration of Bunjevci from same area to Vojvodina and Hungary.Grozdana Maro≈°eviƒá, 2006, One-part Ojkanje-singing in the Historical Perspective, https://hrcak.srce.hr/23185 #page=144-145 The solo singing type of ojkanje is associated most with the Lika region and surrounding Karlovac, while two-part singing is dominant in the wider area of the Croatian coast and its hinterland. Specific types of ojkanje singing can be found between the rivers of Krka and Cetina (Drni≈°ka Krajina), in the regions of Ravni Kotari and Bukovica, in the Cetinska Krajina between Svilaja and Moseƒç, and the hinterlands of Trogir and Ka≈°tela. The mountainous landscape of Lika the Dalmatian hinterland proved ideal for the cultivation of ojkanje. Similar styles of polyphonic singing can be found throughout the Dinaric region of the Balkans, such as ganga, found mainly in Herzegovina and inland Dalmatia, and izvika from the Zlatibor area in Serbia. These enduring musical traditions show a connecting link among the populations of the mountainous regions. Due to emigration, ojkanje groups can now be found in western Serbia and to a smaller extent, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Description The singing style is marked by a distinctive voice-shaking technique where the singer utilizes an archaic form of singing from the throat. Ojkanje has been described as \\"free beat singing\\" that is created deep in the throat, steeped in the tradition of various local communities, and can be divided into two main groups: individual singing or group singing. Lyrics usually cover topics such as love, social or local issues, and politics. *Solo singing, also known as \\"travel singing\\" (putniƒçko, kirid≈æijsko) or \\"solitary singing\\" (samaƒçko) has several different variants depending on the region. One example from the Konavle region is the ustresalica, a shaking type of singing which has died out amongst the community. In Lika, the rozganje type of singing was popular, and is currently kept alive by local folklore groups in the Karlovac region. *Two-part singing can be performed by men or women with two or more people. It is prevalent in the area of the Croatian coast and the Dalmatian hinterland . In group singing, the song lasts as long as the lead singer can hold their breath. The name ojkalica, which is the name used for this type of singing in the area in the hinterland of ≈†ibenik and the villages of Vrlika and Kijevo. Further along the Dalmatian hinterland there are various traditional vocal styles of Ojkanje singing. In Ravni Kotari and Bukovica, the local style of singing is called orzenje (the Serbian Orthodox population calls it orcenje, orcanje or groktanje). Furthermore, when performed by men, the singing is known as treskavica, or starovinsko (\\"old-style\\") today, and when performed by women it is known as vojkavica. Treskavica is also used in the hinterlands of Trogir and Ka≈°tela, but is called grge≈°anje in Greba≈°tica, a village north of Primo≈°ten. In northern Poljice the locals continue to perform the kirid≈æijsko style of singing. History Ojkanje singing originated in its form in the Dinaric region. It especially thrived among the rural population of the Dalmatian hinterland and surrounding regions. Ivan Lovriƒá (1756‚Äî1777) mentions ojkanje as part of Morlach culture. In the beginning of the 20th century, the Croatian Peasant Party began organizing folklore festivals which focused on rural traditions through their charitable wing. Traditional dancing, music, regional costumes were the main focus, especially in the 1920s and 1930s, with Ojkanje singing being an important addition. In 2008, ojkanje singing was nominated by the Croatian Ministry of Culture for inscription on the UNESCO Urgent Safeguarding list. 2010, it was inscribed in UNESCOs List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding as representative of Croatia. Modern day Over the years, Ojkanje singing was passed down from generations, with singers learning directly from their accomplished predecessors. However, the last century has seen significant changes in the traditional rural life, with younger generations migrating to cities and modern ways overtaking certain traditional practices, resulting in the decline of Ojkanje singing. Many folklore groups have been performing to keep Ojkanje singing alive.2\\\\. veƒçer ojkanja A prominent group, \\"KUD Promina\\" from Oklaj was formed by five locals from the area to preserve and perform their region's local Ojkanje singing,Recept ojkalice: Jedan potra, drugi priuzme i trese, a onda svi gonimo do kraja and their success insured them an appearance in the official video on UNESCO's website. Other cultural groups (KUDs) noted by UNESCO that are active in preserving Ojkanje are \\"Sveta Magareta\\" from Velika Jelsa near Karlovac, \\"Gacka\\" from Liƒçko Le≈°ƒáe, \\"Radovin\\" from Radovin, \\"Sveti Nikola Tavelic\\" from Li≈°ane Ostroviƒçke, and notable people from Srijane (near Trilj) and Kokorici (near Vrgorac). Croatian public television has aired numerous programs on ojkanje groups and reviving the custom among young people. Examples of other groups include \\"KUD Petrova Gora - Kordun\\" Beograd,Sjeniƒçarska zabava Retrieved on 2 March 2016 and \\"KUD Kordun - Inƒëija\\",Izvorna grupa Kordun Inƒëija Retrieved on 2 March 2016 formed by ethnic Serbs from the Kordun region of Croatia, but now perform throughout Serbia. There are numerous festivals and cultural events throughout the region that display Ojkanje singing to the public.ƒåetvrti sabor ojkavice: \\"Ajde, brate, zapivaj polako...\\" The village of Prigrevica in Sombor, Serbia, and other places in Vojvodina settled by Military Frontiersmen has the musical tradition of Ojkanje.

At 13-years-old, during her Bat-Mitzvah, Kolton decided she wanted to be a humanistic rabbi and would pursue this dream. Kolton felt a profound pull to live in Israel and learn Hebrew. She attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, earning a bachelor of arts degree in international relations and English literature. Kolton returned to the United States to pursue her master‚Äôs degree in clinical psychology from the Michigan School of Psychology. Subsequently, she enrolled in doctoral studies at the Union Institute & University in Cincinnati and received a Ph.D. She wrote her dissertation on, \\"The Experience of Being a Woman Rabbi.\\" At the same time, she completed rabbinic training with her mentor Rabbi Sherwin T. Wine, who founded Humanistic Judaism in 1963. Career In 1999, Kolton was ordained the first humanistic rabbi by the International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism. In 2004, Kolton was chosen as the successor to her mentor, Rabbi Sherwin Wine. On July 21, 2007, Wine died when a taxicab he was traveling in was struck by another vehicle. In the years that followed, challenges presented themselves to Kolton, who was forced under difficult circumstances to address the issues of her congregants, many of whom had never trusted a rabbi other than Wine. Under Kolton's leadership, the congregation mourned the loss of Wine and ultimately thrived. In 2012, Kolton felt an intense calling to discover what she believed about God, independent of Humanistic Judaism. She resigned her pulpit and set out on a journey that ultimately led her to the Feminine Divine. She was a scholar in residence at Congregation Shirr Tikvah and created ‚ÄúSoulful Living,‚Äù an approach to spirituality in which she taught how to live a soul-centered life. Kolton is known for her commitment to serving interfaith couples and conducting interfaith marriage ceremonies. Over the course of her career she has worked with thousands of people at times of great joy and great sorrow. Personal life She is married to Isaac Kolton, an Israeli born in Petah Tikva. They have two children, Lior and Maya.

Biography After qualifying as an accountant, Giorgi volunteered for military service and was admitted as a cadet to the Palermo military school in 1935. The following year he was promoted to the rank of Aspirante Ufficiale (Acting 2nd Lieutenant). Assigned to the 21¬∫ Reggimento Fanteria, after being commissioned as a Sottotenente (2nd Lieutenant) he was transferred to the Regio Esercito medical school in Florence until he was demobilized in 1937. He was recalled to active duty two years later. When Italy entered World War II (1940), he was serving in the 21¬∫ Reggimento Fanteria attached to the \\"Cremona\\" Division where he would stay for the duration of hostilities. In the meantime he rose in rank, being promoted to Tenente in January 1940, to Capitano in January 1942 and to leader of the 3rd Compagnia Fucilieri (Rifle Company) in 1943. On 8 September 1943 he was in Corsica and he participated in the heavy fighting against the Germans. Italian troops, led by General Clemente Primieri, eventually managed to oust their former allies from the island. The \\"Cremona\\" Division was later moved to Sardinia for garrison duties. Giorgi remained a member of it when it was turned into the Gruppo di Combattimento Cremona (part of the Italian Co-Belligerent Army). He was noted for being an officer with \\"a strong personality and ascendancy over his men\\".A. Boldrini, Diario di Bulow, Vangelista, Milano, 1985, p.281. In March 1945, Captain Giorgi took part in operations in the Comacchio area as commander of the 3rd Company of the reformed 21¬∞ Reggimento Fanteria, operating on the far right of the British Eighth Army. It was here that he earned his first Gold Medal for two courageous actions: leading two volunteers, he captured a well-defended German stronghold near Chiavica Pedone (on the left bank of the Reno river) and the following night, he rescued a badly wounded partisan (Menotti Conti, 1925‚Äì1959) who was lying in a minefield. He was decorated \\"in the field\\" on 6 March at Ravenna, in the presence of the highest Allied military authorities in Italy: Field Marshal Harold Alexander, General Sir Richard McCreery and General Charles Keightley. During the offensive that would lead to the final breakdown of German and Fascist forces in Italy, Giorgi took command of a small group of soldiers and attacked a withdrawing convoy. The action resulted in the capture of 80 Germans and of the materiel which the trucks were transporting. He was seriously wounded by shellfire between 26 and 27 April while he was trying to free two fellow servicemen from the rubble of a destroyed emplacement near Croce di Cavarzere. Admitted to the 66th British Field Hospital in Ferrara, he died ten days later. He received a posthumous second Gold Medal and also a US Silver Star, awarded for \\"exceptional acts of valor\\". Honors and awards 80px Gold Medal of Military Valor A company commander, he attacked a well- defended enemy stronghold surrounded by barbed wire entanglements and minefields with the sole escort of two volunteer infantrymen, approaching the enemy installation in full daylight. Leaving the two infantrymen behind, after wading a small creek he single-handedly stormed the fortification still under fire from our artillery and, throwing numerous hand grenades, he wrought panic among the defenders, 19 of whom surrendered. Joined by his platoon, he completed the occupation of the emplacement and, under raging enemy suppression fire, he disregarded his own safety to free two of his men trapped under the rubble of a bombed-out shelter, saving them from certain death. The following night he learned that a soldier from another unit was seriously wounded and lying in a minefield where no one had dared rescue him before defusing the land mines. Crawling alone and touching the terrain palm by palm, after one hour or more of exhausting effort, he managed to save him. [He was a] splendid example of gallantry and of generous selflessness of the Italian people. Chiavica Pedone (Ravenna), 2‚Äì3 March 1945. 80px Gold Medal of Military Valor During the days of the grand Spring offensive conducted by the Allied Armies in Italy, he repeated with the same daring and in the same fashion more deeds no smaller than those which had earned him a Gold Medal. In the latest, leading a group of bold soldiers, he fiercely attacked a convoy attempting redeployment and dispersed it with several PIAT shots and hand grenades, capturing 80 prisoners, many vehicles and a large number of arms and ammunition. Again in the lead of his men he received a wound which would later cause his death. He died peacefully with his last thoughts aimed at his family and country, in the bright satisfaction of having accomplished in full consciousness and absolute modesty his duty of soldier and Italian, for whom the first Gold Medal was not a point of arrival, but a point of honor to do more and better, as he in fact did.

Club career Zhao Yanming began his football career playing for the Tianjin Teda's youth team before he eventually graduated permanently to the senior team by Giuseppe Materazzi in the 2003 league season where he spent the majority of the season playing as the team's third choice goalkeeper. For the next season he would work his way up as the team's second choice goalkeeper until Liu Yunfei left at the beginning of the 2006 league season to join Shanghai Shenhua, which left the goalkeeping spot up for grabs. The Tianjin coach Liu Chunming would let Zhao fight for the spot against fellow goalkeeper Tian Xu at the beginning of the season and on March 19, 2006 in the second league game of the season against Shenzhen Kingway Zhao was given his chance to establish himself within the team, which he did when he kept a clean sheet in a 3-0 victory. By the end of the season he was firmly established as the team's first choice goalkeeper and Tianjin finished sixth at the end of the season. Despite having a respectable campaign for a young goalkeeper the club brought in a new manager in Jozef Jarabinsk√Ω as well as a new goalkeeper in Yang Jun who Jarabinsk√Ω preferred. While Zhao may have been relegated back to the bench he stayed positive for the next several seasons until Arie Haan came to Tianjin as their manager at the beginning of the 2010 league season and promoted Zhao as the team's first choice goalkeeper once again after Yang Jun left the club after a contract dispute.

In the 1970s, he was largely responsible for developing the BHA's policy on education, covering both religious and non-religious life stances. Stopes-Roe invented and popularised the term \\"life stance\\", initially in the context of debates over the controversial content of the City of Birmingham's Agreed Syllabus for Religious Education in 1975, which referred to \\"non-religious stances for living\\", as did the subsequent British Humanist Association (BHA) booklet \\"Objective, Fair and Balanced\\" which he and David Pollock produced later in the same year. In the late 1980s, he initiated a successful campaign for the adoption of the term by the IHEU and other organisations. He represented the BHA on the Religious Education Council and he led the Values Education Council for many years. He was also president of Birmingham Humanists prior to his death. In 1986, along with Barbara Smoker, he became one of the last two Appointed Lecturers at the South Place Ethical Society, a position he retained until his death, though the Conway Hall Sunday Lectures have not been given by Appointed Lecturers for many years.

Top of the Jewish presence in Neuilly The first significant evidence of a Jewish presence in Neuilly is the \\"house of refuge for Jewish children\\", a home created in 1866 by Coralie Cahen the house also hosted prostitutes and their children. Initially located at Romainville then Neuilly Boulevard Eugene (now Boulevard Victor Hugo), it moved in 1883 to 19, Boulevard de la Saussaye where it stayed until the 1980s. Better known by the abbreviated name of \\"Refuge,\\" it housed many young Jews isolated, without family, after the Second World War and after the independence of Algeria, and the subsequent massmigration of Jews to France. The Synagogue Synagogue de Neuilly The Synagogue de Neuilly during a demonstration for the release of Gilad Shalit. By 1869, there was a community located in an apartment at 15 rue Louis-Philippe. Chairman, Godchaux Oulry, a native of Lorraine, succeeded in raising the funds necessary to build a synagogue. The architect was Emile Uhlmann, who choose to build in the Neo- Byzantine style. The opening took place in 1878. The first rabbi of Neuilly in 1888, was Simon Debr√©, father of Professor Robert Debr√© and the grandfather of the General de Gaulle's Prime-Minister Michel Debr√©. The community grew until World War II and the synagogue expanded in 1937 under the eye of architects Germain Debr√© and Hirsch. As it was for all Jewish communities, the war brought desolation. Rabbi Robert Meyers and his wife Suzanne (n√©e Bauer) were deported to Auschwitz in 1943. A plaque outside the synagogue commemorates the deportation of all Jews inhabitants of Neuilly and others, and the courageous action of the Righteous Among the Nations in Neuilly. On Rue Edouard Nortier, another plaque commemorates the names of 17 children aged 3 to 11 years, who were housed in a former clinic run by the Nuns, they were on July 25, 1944 rounded up, deported and murdered by the Nazis. The rebirth after the war was difficult. It is important to note the efforts of Rabbi David Feuerwerker (he was the rabbi from 1946 to 1948) to create a study circle and a circle of young people. His successor, Edouard Gourevitch, saw the arrival in 1962 of huge number of Jews from Algeria who brought a new vitality to the community. In 1975, the Grand Rabbi Jerome Cahen and his wife revived the community, turning resolutely towards youth. The number of believers increased dramatically. In 1978, the centenary of the synagogue was celebrated in the presence of the authorities and former Prime Minister Michel Debr√©. Rabbi Alexis Blum succeeds Jerome Cahen, who died in 1988. In 2009, Rabbi Michael Azoulay, a member of the National Consultative Ethics Committee since 2008, succeeded Rabbi Alexis Blum.

The Missoula Cemetery was first established in 1884 by the Missoula Valley Improvement Company, a corporation owned by prominent citizens Isadore Cohn, Frank Woody, William H.H. Dickinson and Thomas C Marshall. The land where the cemetery would be built was purchased from the Northern Pacific Railroad for $168. The cemetery was eventually sold to the City of Missoula in 1901, for the total of $1. These are the original stone column gates to the Missoula Cemetery first erected in 1884 History The Missoula Cemetery was created in 1884 to house those who had succumbed to the harsh life of a small mill town. The cemetery initially had very wide-set roads for easy access by wagon. Eventually, the waning use of wagons made the wide roads obsolete and the cemetery had to be renovated. The roads through the cemetery have since been narrowed to allow for more plots. The Missoula Cemetery has many of the town's original founders buried there. C. P. Higgins and his family, who once had their graves at the base of Whitaker Hill on the southern side of Missoula, now have their bodies buried in the Missoula Cemetery. Location and expansion The Missoula Cemetery began as a small plot of land purchased out of necessity. The lack of modern medicine, prominence of disease, paired with the dangerous habits of the late 19th-century West made life expectancy low and dictated the need for a cemetery. The original founders, the Missoula Valley Improvement Company, owned the cemetery for many years, only relinquishing it to the City of Missoula in 1901. Upon purchasing the land, the City Council appointed the first Board of Trustees to manage the maintenance of the cemetery. It consisted of Samuel Bellew, Harriet Keith, E. A. Winstanley, Mrs. F. H. Woody, Lizzie Mills and Lucinda Worden. The current trustees are Marjorie Jacobs, Sharee Fraser, Carol Gorden, Patrick J. McHugh and Mary Lou Cordis. The Missoula Cemetery still holds the same location as when it was founded in 1884, about three miles (5 km) northwest of the city's center. The cemetery has since grown from to a total of approximately . Only of the plots are occupied by graves. The remaining 40 have been purchased by the City of Missoula for further expansion and development. Prominent graves Some of the more prominent locals of Missoula's past have bold elaborate tombstones to commemorate their lives, like Francis Worden's large marble tombstone. Others are made of simple marble that masks their renowned accomplishments in life, like Jeanette Rankin's black stone with a plainly marked face. Below is a short list of some of the better-known characters of Missoula's past, beginning with their name and followed by their death date. *Christopher P. Higgins-10/14/1889 Co-founder of Missoula and a member of Missoula's first Territorial Legislature. *Francis L. Worden-2/5/1887 Co-founder of Missoula and successful businessman. He soon became Higgins' political enemy. *Edward L. Bonner-7/10/1902 A prominent businessman who collaborated with A.B. Hammond to found the Missoula Mercantile in the early 1880s. The town of Bonner, Montana, is named after him. *Daniel E. Bandmann-11/23/1905 Actor and rancher. He gave his name to the location of Bandmann flats that lay just east of Bonner, Montana. *Thomas L. Greenough-7/23/1911 Was a successful settler who built a mansion and formed Greenough Park, east of Missoula, Montana. *James H.T. Ryman-5/31/1926 He was the head principal of public schools and served as trustee to the public library for 30 years. *Emma Dickenson-1/1/1927 Missoula's first teacher. *Albert J. Gibson-12/31/1927 One of Missoula's first architects who began building the University of Montana campus in Missoula, starting with University Hall. *Jeanette P. Rankin-5/8/1973 She is not actually buried in the Missoula cemetery, but it hosts a memorial to her life. She was the first woman to ever be elected to the U.S. Congress. Her legacy greatly outstands her tombstone, which simply says her name, birth and death date. *M. Winnifred Feighner, Assistant librarian at University of Montana and daughter of Missoula pioneers Daniel R. Feighner and Jennie Monroe Unmarked graves In 1903, the Northern Pacific Railway purchased nearly 400 gravesites in Missoula's Cemetery for Japanese laborers who worked for the railway company. These sites were bought for the purpose of burying 100 bodies of those who died while working on the railroad in Plains, Montana. Most of these sites remain unmarked, with a select few bearing Japanese script across the tombstones. Japanese tombstones were typically made of standard marble and stood at about threeStott, Annette. (2008). Pioneer Cemeteries: Sculpture Gardens of the Old West. Anette Stott. pp. 22. feet off the ground. Most of the Japanese grave sites in Missoula's cemetery have no markings of this kind. This is due in part to the fact that Japanese immigrants didn't always bring their entire families over; therefore there was no one to write an epitaph for them. The Japanese workers employed by the Great Northern Railway typically made considerably less than white workers. The Japanese made 90 cents per ten- hour day, compared to Whites making $1.45. In 1864, Congress made it possible for the Northern Pacific Railway to purchase and advance production on nearly 14 million acres of land between Minnesota and Oregon, which is how so many Japanese ended up in the Missoula Cemetery. Missoula's own A.B. Hammond collaborated with the Northern Pacific and create wood mills, railroad ties, and other essentials for the railroad and its workers.

He was born at Clifton, Bristol. The son of a haulage contractor from Keynsham, Ollis was an upright left- handed batsman used either as an opener or in the middle order. He also bowled occasional right-arm medium pace and once or twice kept wicket. Ollis played for Somerset's second eleven in the Second Eleven Championship and the Minor Counties from 1978, and made his first-class debut in two matches at the end of the 1981 season. He played only once in 1982, but in 1983, he was brought into the team when Somerset's Test players, Ian Botham, Vic Marks, Viv Richards and Joel Garner disappeared on World Cup duty and stayed there for much of the season. Ollis's first game of the season was against Gloucestershire at Bristol; after two declarations, Gloucestershire set Somerset 330 to win in 217 minutes and as opening batsmen Ollis and Somerset captain Peter Roebuck made no attempt to go for the runs. At the designated close of play, they had reached 174 for no wicket, with Ollis not out 99, and Gloucestershire captain David Graveney bowled an extra over in an attempt to secure Ollis his century; however Ollis was unable to score from it, and finished on 99 not out. That proved to be the highest score of Ollis's first- class career, though he passed 50 twice more in the 1983 season on his way to his best aggregate and average, 517 runs at 25.85. In 1984, Ollis was out of form and featured in only six first-class matches, making only 112 runs in them. But he returned to fairly regular cricket in 1985, appearing in 15 first-class matches and turning out regularly for the first time in Somerset's limited-overs side, though without much success. His 55 against Warwickshire was his only score of more than 50 in all matches in 1985, and it was overshadowed by the innings of 322 by Richards, made in less than five hours; Ollis shared a third wicket partnership of 174 with Richards. At the end of the 1985 season, Ollis's contract was not renewed by Somerset and he left first-class cricket.

Hunger strike Sheehan was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland. In 1978 he was convicted of causing an explosion and sentenced to 15 years. Sheehan was the 17th republican inmate at the Maze Prison to join the 1981 hunger strikes, which was aimed at gaining political status for Provisional IRA and Irish National Liberation Army prisoners. He began fasting on 10 August - after nine prisoners had already starved themselves to death - and ended when the hunger strike was officially called off on 3 October. He survived 55 days without food. By the time Sheehan began fasting, the strike had already begun to break. Another protester, Paddy Quinn, was taken off the hunger strike on 31 July after his mother called for medical intervention when her son was close to death following 47 days without food. This action - and calls by the Catholic Church to end the strike - prompted other relatives to do the same. The last prisoner to die was Michael Devine, who starved to death on 20 August after 60 days. The hunger strike was ultimately called off after it had become clear that nearly all the prisoners' families would intervene to stop their sons from dying. He was released in 1987, but was convicted again in 1989 for more bombing offences and sentenced to 24 years. He was released under the terms of the 1998 Belfast Agreement. On 3 October 2006, Sheehan marked the 25th anniversary of the end of the hunger strike by reading the prisoners' statement that ended the protest outside the gates of the now closed Maze Prison. Political career On 7 December 2010, he succeeded Gerry Adams as MLA for Belfast West, Adams having resigned in order to contest the 2011 Irish general election. Sheehan retained the seat for Sinn F√©in at the 2011 Assembly election. Sheehan has provoked anger and controversy by describing the Troubles as \\"probably quite civilised\\" and saying the IRA \\"could have left a 1,000lb car bomb on the Shankill\\" if it wanted to kill Protestants. As at August 2015, he is a Political Member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board. Personal life Pat Sheehan is the widower of Sinn F√©in activist Siobh√°n O'Hanlon who died from cancer in 2006. He has a son. Pat is also a keen cricket fan.

The school was founded in 1996, under the name Chelmsford Public Charter School by a small group of parents from Chelmsford, Massachusetts. While initially a middle school serving only the town of Chelmsford, IACS has since expanded, establishing a high school and serving multiple towns within Massachusetts.  History of IACS  Innovation Academy Charter School was created in 1996 by a group of parents in Chelmsford, Massachusetts. Its first class of middle school students, grades 5-8, was made up of fewer than 150 students. Originally called Chelmsford Public Charter School, it served students in Chelmsford only. A few years later the school was renamed Murdoch Middle School. It then served mainly three towns; Chelmsford, Billerica, and Lowell. It remained in Chelmsford for several years while growing in size, at one point occupying part of the Chelmsford Old Town Hall. Walter Landberg became the executive director and the school was renamed to Innovation Academy Charter School. The school then moved to Tyngsborough, Massachusetts where it became known as a regional charter school, expanding to also serve the towns of Dracut, Groton, Tewksbury, and Westford, among others. Walter Landberg eventually left the school, after completing building projects for a new track and field and a building for the 5th and 6th grades named in his honor.  IACS Today  IACS has since expanded the original school into grades 5-12, a full middle school and high school. The school has four outcomes: problem solving, community membership, effective communication, and self-direction. = High school = The first graduation class of the high school was spring of 2011. The graduating class had 100% acceptance into a 4-year college. The students are split into groups of approximately 9 students called an \\"advisory\\". The advisory is led by a member of the high school staff who helps the students with school work and high school life. The school year is semester based with reports sent home 1/3 and 2/3 of the way through the semester. Grading is A, B, C, D, and F. Honors in individual classes are achieved by doing extra work assigned by the teacher and raises the GPA of that class by .5. Honors credit is not received with a D or F grade in that class. = Middle school = Middle school is divided into 4 \\"teams\\". 2 teams are grades 5 and 6, and 2 others are grades 7 and 8. These teams are named after the outcome of the school listed above. The teams are further divided into advisories of 12-13 people. The middle school is made up of about 400 students. The school year is divided into quarters, with reports sent home at the end of every quarter. Students wishing to achieve honor roll must receive at least 3 P's and no grade below an A/P (see Grading). Distinguished honor roll requires no grade below a P and at least 1 D.  Grading  The middle school uses a unique grading system. D, P, A, N, and W. D stands for distinguished and is the same as an A+. P stands for Proficient and is the same as a A-. A stands for apprentice and is the same as a C. N stands for Novice and is the same as a D. W stands for warning and is the same as an F. Students are graded on Application, Comprehension, and the school outcomes.  Sports  = Middle school = The fall middle school sports teams consists of boys soccer grades 5-8, girls soccer grades 5-8, JV Volleyball grades 5-7, Varsity Volleyball grades 6-8, and cross-country grades 5-8. Boys soccer won their league championship in the 2010 season and the 2014 season. The girls won their league championship in 2013. In 2011 the cross-country team placed 14 at a USATF New England Cross Country Invitational meet. Winter middle school sports are indoor track grades 5-8, cheerleading grades 5-8, boys JV basketball, girls JV basketball, boys varsity basketball, and girls varsity basketball. Indoor track was added in the winter of 2011, as was cheerleading. Spring sports offered are Kickball grade 5, Softball grades 6-8, Baseball grades 6-8,0 Dance grades 5-8, and Co-ed Track & Field grades 5-8. Softball, baseball, dance, and kickball were all added in the 2012 spring season. IACS dance has been very successful in the past, receiving golds, high golds, platinums, and high platinum awards both at regionals and nationals, as well as many overall awards, including 1st place! IACS middle school track and field had a successful second season in spring 2011 when four middle school boys set the New England 4 √ó 400 metres relay record with a time of 3:44.63. In the 2012 season, the boys placed 2nd in the state meet and girls placed 9th in the state.

These simple groups are the only finite non-abelian ones with orders not divisible by 3. Constructions =Suzuki= originally constructed the Suzuki groups as subgroups of SL4(F22n+1) generated by certain explicit matrices. =Ree= Ree observed that the Suzuki groups were the fixed points of exceptional automorphisms of some symplectic groups of dimension 4, and used this to construct two further families of simple groups, called the Ree groups. In the lowest case the symplectic group B2(2)‚âàS6; its exceptional automorphism fixes the subgroup Sz(2) or 2B2(2), of order 20. gave a detailed exposition of Ree's observation. =Tits= constructed the Suzuki groups as the symmetries of a certain ovoid in 3-dimensional projective space over a field of characteristic 2. =Wilson= constructed the Suzuki groups as the subgroup of the symplectic group in 4 dimensions preserving a certain product on pairs of orthogonal vectors. Properties Let q = 22n+1, r = 2n, n a non-negative integer. The Suzuki groups Sz(q) or 2B2(q) are simple for n‚â•1. The group Sz(2) is solvable and is the Frobenius group of order 20. The Suzuki groups Sz(q) have orders q2(q2+1)(q‚àí1). These groups have orders divisible by 5, not by 3. The Schur multiplier is trivial for n>1, Klein 4-group for n=1, i. e. Sz(8). The outer automorphism group is cyclic of order 2n+1, given by automorphisms of the field of order q. Suzuki group are Zassenhaus groups acting on sets of size (22n+1)2+1, and have 4-dimensional representations over the field with 22n+1 elements. Suzuki groups are CN-groups: the centralizer of every non- trivial element is nilpotent. =Subgroups= When n is a positive integer. Sz(q) has at least 4 types of maximal subgroups. The diagonal subgroup is cyclic, of order q - 1. * The lower triangular (Borel) subgroup and its conjugates, of order q2¬∑(q-1). They are one-point stabilizers in a doubly transitive permutation representation of Sz(q). * The dihedral group Dq-1, normalizer of the diagonal subgroup, and conjugates. * Cq+2r+1:4 * Cq-2r+1:4 * Smaller Suzuki groups, when 2n+1 is composite. Either q+2r+1 or q-2r+1 is divisible by 5, so that Sz(q) contains the Frobenius group C5:4. =Conjugacy classes= showed that the Suzuki group has q+3 conjugacy classes. Of these q+1 are strongly real, and the other two are classes of elements of order 4. *q2+1 Sylow 2-subgroups of order q2, of index q‚Äì1 in their normalizers. 1 class of elements of order 2, 2 classes of elements of order 4. *q2(q2+1)/2 cyclic subgroups of order q‚Äì1, of index 2 in their normalizers. These account for (q‚Äì2)/2 conjugacy classes of non-trivial elements. *Cyclic subgroups of order q+2r+1, of index 4 in their normalizers. These account for (q+2r)/4 conjugacy classes of non-trivial elements. *Cyclic subgroups of order q‚Äì2r+1, of index 4 in their normalizers. These account for (q‚Äì2r)/4 conjugacy classes of non-trivial elements. The normalizers of all these subgroups are Frobenius groups. =Characters= showed that the Suzuki group has q+3 irreducible representations over the complex numbers, 2 of which are complex and the rest of which are real. They are given as follows: *The trivial character of degree 1. *The Steinberg representation of degree q2, coming from the doubly transitive permutation representation. *(q‚Äì2)/2 characters of degree q2+1 *Two complex characters of degree r(q‚Äì1) where r=2n *(q+2r)/4 characters of degree (q‚Äì2r+1)(q‚Äì1) *(q‚Äì2r)/4 characters of degree (q+2r+1)(q‚Äì1).

Completed in 1927, it once housed the Paramount Theatre. It was designated a New York City Landmark in 1988. History Paramount Pictures, one of the major American motion picture companies in the 1920s, built its headquarters at the 1501 Broadway location along with a cinematic theatre. Construction lasted between 1926 and 1927, costing $13.5 million.The Paramount Building. NYC Architecture. Retrieved November 16, 2010. At the time of its completion, it was the tallest building in Times Square, and once sported an observation deck. Paramount president Adolph Zukor had acquired a controlling interest in the Chicago-based Balaban and Katz theatre chain, and with it the services of Sam Katz, who became the head of Paramount's theatre division. Balaban and Katz had a long working relationship with the Chicago architectural firm Rapp and Rapp (C. W Rapp and George L. Rapp),, p.258 which had designed numerous theaters for his company in the Midwest. They later hired the firm to design their new Manhattan flagship theater and office tower. The Rapp brothers created a thirty-three story office tower which was influenced by the Art Deco style, and a theatre in the palatial Neo-Renaissance style behind it. In 1922, Paramount Pictures had purchased the Putnam Building. Construction of the building began on November 1925. The Paramount Theatre opened on November 19, 1926. With the spin-off of the theater units in 1950 as United Paramount Theatre, Inc. (UPT) the building became the UPT's headquarters being leased along with the theater from Paramount Pictures. The building continued as American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres's headquarters after UPT's merger with ABC. The theater closed in 1964 under UPT ownership only to be reopened later that year under new ownership, while ABC moved to the ABC Building at 1330 Avenue of the Americas in 1965. The theater was dismantled in 1967. Today, the Paramount Building is known for its large four-faced clock near the top of the pyramidal architectural feature, with the hours denoted by twelve five-pointed stars (forming a circle of stars as used in the Paramount Pictures logo), topped by an ornamental glass globe. At the outset of World War II, the globe and clock were painted black to maintain blackout conditions for fear of an enemy invasion; they were restored in 1996. Architecture The ceilings were painted with a fresco and gilded, while the railings were manufactured from brass. There were Greek statues and busts carved in wall niches, while the restrooms and waiting rooms were grandiose in style in comparison to cathedrals at the time. The highlight of the decor was an enormous crystal chandelier in the main lobby.Paramount Theatre. Cinematreasures.org. Retrieved November 16, 2010. The theatre with 3,664 seats, was located at the rear of the building and served as the company's flagship venue where its major films would be premiered. The top of the building, featuring the clock and globe, as seen from the west The theatre entrance at the front of the Paramount Building is marked by a five-story arch on Broadway with an elaborate curved marquee, which was restored in 2007. A long gallery passed from there through the office building to reach the theatre itself, which occupied the rear of the building which extends through the middle of the block between 43rd and 44th streets. This structure included a long grand lobby along the south end which opened into the auditorium facing a stage at the north end. The lobby was modeled after the Paris Opera House with white marble columns, balustrades and an opening arms grand staircase. Within the auditorium, the drapes were colored in red velvet and the rugs were designed in a similar red. The interior of it was very high but somewhat shallow as necessitated by its allotted space. In addition, a large orchestra pit could be raised and lowered from the basement for theatric use. Terrorism On the morning of March 6, 2008, an unknown individual placed a small bomb in front of a United States Armed Forces recruiting station across Seventh Avenue from the building.

He was quickly arrested, tortured and later executed by quartering along with most of his relatives. According to one hypothesis, the assassination of Nadir Khan may have been done in revenge for the taxes and execution of Hazaras. And for actions of Ghulam Nabi Charkhi who was a former Afghanistan ambassador to Moscow who took part in the Afghan civil war of 1928-29 as a supporter of the previous ruler of Afghanistan, the reform-minded Amanullah Khan.  Life  Khaliq was born in 1916 in the Chindawol area of Kabul, Afghanistan. He was a student at Nejat High School. Khaliq witnessed the rise of King Nadir Khan from 1929 and the assassinations of Afghanistan's intellectuals and politicians. Nadir, who was a general of King Amanullah Khan, was summoned by Amanullah to fight against Habibullah Kalakani and restore the monarchy, but instead Nadir proclaimed himself king. He systematically hand-picked supporters of Amanullah Khan and imprisoned them. For years he plucked any person who he would think would someday stand against his reign were eliminated. The wrath of Nader was over anyone not of the Mohammadzai tribe, his targets included the former king and his Pashtun clans, the Tajiks of the north and the Hazaras of central Afghanistan. In 1933, Khaliq's uncle, brothers and father were arrested by Nadir Khan's regime after the execution of Ghulam Nabi Charkhi, an Amanullah supporter.  Assassination of the King  Khaliq plotted to kill King Nader Khan. The first attempt was at the Independence Day gathering at the Id Gah Mosque, but Khaliq did not attend. A few months later, opportunity arose when Nader Shah invited athletes of his high school to the palace to distribute medals for their achievements. Khaliq was one of the attendees and saw no security units at the gates. Khaliq rode his bike back to the Pamir Cinema area and brought with him a gun that belonged to his friend Is'haq Sherdel. M1895, the same type of revolver which Khaliq used to assassinate the King ‚ÄúKhaliq returned with a Nagant M1895 loaded with 6 bullets of 7.62√ó38mmR wrapped in a handkerchief hidden in his pocket. He stood behind Is'haq Sherdel and Mahmood. The national flag was lowered and Nader Shah entered the rose garden. He examined the medals table and walked over towards the students. Khaliq reached into his pocket and pulled out the gun, aimed at Nader Shah and pulled the trigger. The first bullet hit Nader in his mouth, the second shot pierced Nader's heart, and the third shot cut through Nader's lung. The guards rushed towards Khaliq and a fourth bullet hit a guard. Khaliq then threw the gun as the guards chased him‚Äù. Shah Mahmood ordered the arrest of over 400 \\"Nejat High school\\" students and by executive decree ordered all students to be put to death. A soldier in the national guard convinced Mahmood that the students were innocent, and they were then released.  Execution  Abdul Khaliq Hazara before being executed Khaliq was imprisoned and under torture gave up the names of his accomplices. Khaliq was given a trial in which he named all his friends and family members as accomplices. This strength of these claims has since been questioned by the lone surviving member of Khaliq's family. He was eventually sentenced to death along with 16 others. The majority of Khaliq's family were taken to the Deh Mazang prison. Sixteen nooses were prepared at the execution site. Khaliq was brought over and was asked with which one of his fingers he squeezed the trigger. He lifted his index finger, and immediately that finger was cut off. He was then questioned which eye he used to aim, upon which they immediately gouged out that eye with a dagger. The authorities eventually tortured Khaliq to death instead of hanging him.http://www.afghanland.com/history/biography/Khaliq.htmlaccessdate=November \\"Security officers tortured Khaliq by cutting his tongue and gouging his eyes and soldiers killed him with bayonets while his family and friends were forced to watch.

The first one appeared in the baseboards of the home of Jonathan and Kathleen Wright in 1993. Subsequently, several others were discovered in their home: in the fireplace surround and two in the kitchen. On April 7, 2005 the first was seen in public on the exterior of Sweetwaters Coffee and Tea. Since then, ten more have shown up around Ann Arbor (as well as a \\"goblin door\\" parody), and seven of the original \\"public\\" doors still exist.Urban Fairies Locations-Sweetwaters History The first public fairy door appeared outside Sweetwaters Coffee and Tea on April 7, 2005.McKee, Jenn. \\"Opening the secrets behind fairy doors in Ann Arbor\\", Detroit News, May 31, 2015 installed by Jonathan B.

The third door was found on May 11, 2005 outside of the Selo-Shevel Gallery art gallery. On June 9, 2005, Jefferson Market received a fairy door, but the store closed in October 2007. The Ann Arbor Framing Co. discovered the next door on August 17, 2005, but the company closed in the summer of 2008 and the fairy door vanished. The concert hall The Ark hosted the next door when it appeared August 25, 2005. The furniture and gift store Red Shoes was next, where one appeared on November 17, 2005. On April 11, 2006 a fairy door appeared at the boutique Voil√†. When Voil√† closed on November 15, 2006 the fairy door disappeared as well. The ninth door was installed in the back of Nicola's Books on September 8, 2006 and was built into a bookcase and books at the Ann Arbor District Library on November 4, 2006. In 2010 a rural fairy door appeared in a not-for profit preschool and dependent older adult day care in Dexter, Mighigan called Generations Together. It is said to have a portal that can be found in Gordon Field which is in front of Gordon Hall a historic landmark in Dexter. They are so new they have not been pictured and described in detail anywhere but on the urban-fairies.com website. At one time a few establishments kept guest books which visitors could sign or ask pertinent questions or draw pictures. This led Wright to release the children's book Who's Behind the Fairy Doors? Locations and descriptions Of the original ten public Ann Arbor fairy doors, seven still exist in and around the downtown area. *The door at Sweetwaters is located inside, down on the baseboards opposite the counter. It is a simple white door with small details mimicking the detailing found outside the cafe. *The door at the Peaceable Kingdom is outside, to the right of the entrance, and a small \\"fairy gift store\\" is visible inside. *The Selo- Shevel Gallery door is found on the Liberty St. side of the building, at sidewalk level. It is a simple red door with tiny grey bricks framing the door.Szumko, Stefan. \\"Walking tour hits the fairy doors of Ann Arbor\\", Ann Arbor News, March 30, 2011 *The door at The Ark can be found on the left side of what once was the ticket booth. The door mimics the style of the building and is a simple brown with a stained-glass window. During renovation of the Ark in 2018, the fairies temporarily replaced this door with a construction entrance in front of the building. *The door at Red Shoes is both inside and out, directly to the right of the entrance. The small red door is a near-exact replica of the actual entrance; inside the store is a small green one similar to the doors found inside the building. Written on the red door outside is 'Ours 123-4:5683?', which is a take on the real entrance that lists the store 'hours'. *The Ann Arbor District Library door is found on the end of the Fairytale and Folklore bookshelf in the Youth Department. It's a small blue double door with a teal frame and an entire room set inside of \\"books\\" like the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and Hans Christian Andersen's Eighty Fairy Tales. Inside you can see a small table, decorated walls, and other furniture. *The door at Nicola's Books in the Westgate Shopping Center on Jackson Rd., is set above the fireplace in the back of the store. It is dark brown and the frame is made of two books spines Andersen's Fairy Tales and Cinderella and Other Italian Fairy Tales. Other newer fairy doors are appearing around Ann Arbor: *Two additional doors appeared next to the original Sweetwaters door. One is a small, wooden building with a small coffee table inside.

Another door located deeper in the office has a portal to take employees directly to the Ford office in Dearborn. *The fairy doors found at Generations Together and in Gordon Field are identical. They are made of rustic wood and their porches contain tiny bouquets of wheat on either side of the doors. Their porches are supported tree branches. *The door at Washtenaw Dairy, located on the corner of South Ashley and West Madison, is found outside to the right of the main entrance to the shop. *In November 2015, a fairy door was encountered for the first time on the campus of the University of Michigan, on the main floor of the Bob and Betty Beyster Building, which houses the Computer Science and Engineering division. The door is set on a tower computer case. Pressing the computer's power button turns the lights up inside the case, revealing a dreamscape world with winged fairies. *A miniature ATM exists at the Bank of Ann Arbor location on Washington. *There's a fairy door in the ATM vestibule of the Hooper Hathaway building on Main Street. *Arborland Starbucks features a fairyland cafe inside the store. *The Document Delivery Office at the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library at the University of Michigan has a fairy door, complete with a doorbell that summons assistance from the staff. *There is a fairy door inside Silvio's Organic Ristorante e Pizzeria. Local response The fairy doors have taken on a cult following in Ann Arbor and surrounding small towns such as Dexter where the first rural fairy door and its portal can be found. The local children leave gifts in the hopes that real fairies will receive them. Some presents left at the doors include pennies and nickels, drawings, tiny packages, candies, and shiny rocks. Some of the doors, like the one found in Sweetwaters, have guestbooks nearby for visitors to write reflections, stories, draw fairies, and ask questions. Sometimes a \\"fairy\\" will answer the questions in the journals. The general attitude toward the fairy doors is that of mysticism and childlike adoration. The Ann Arbor Chamber of Commerce and some of the businesses with fairy doors hand out maps and sell copies of Jonathan B. Wright's Who's Behind the Fairy Doors? and posters with pictures of each door and its location. Many articles, including local and national, have been published regarding the doors.

Early life Bambrick was born in Ottawa, Ontario and raised in Chelsea, Quebec, Winifred Bambrick was an accomplished harpist since the age of 12 and played in all the capitals of North America and Europe. Bambrick made her debut as a harpist at New York City's Aeolian Hall on October 22, 1913. The following year, she recorded a number of selections for Edison Records' Diamond Disc series, including Robert Ambrose's \\"One Sweetly Solemn Thought\\", Gabriel Verdalle's \\"Vision\\" and Angelo Francis Pinto's \\"Tarantelle\\". She subsequently played in John Philip Sousa's band from 1920 to 1930, and then spent the 1930s performing as a solo artist and with a circus orchestra in Europe.  Career  Her experience in Europe, which coincided with the events that would lead to World War II, inspired the novel \\"Continental Revue\\", which was published in 1946. \\"A friend had sent the manuscript to a publisher without my knowing it and it certainly was a surprise when I was told it had been sold\\" Miss. Bambrick said. Winifred Bambrick gave a recital in Ottawa and began a concert tour which took her across Canada to places such as Winnipeg, Regina, Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver. However, the tour ended in time for her to receive the Governor General's Award for English-language fiction at the Canadian authors Association Convention, which took place the summer of 1947. When attending the Canadian authors Association Convention, Bambrick confessed in an interview \\"I had planned on going to Vancouver anyway, but at the time I made my reservations I never dreamed I'd go out to receive any award.\\" Her prize winning novel, which is based on her concert tours through Europe before the war, took one year to write. She states \\"there were more than 1,000 pages of it at first, but I managed to cut it down to a little over 400.\\" In the end she had to cut her story in half. Entire chapters were left out and \\"some of my favourite ones at that,\\" she stated. The novel was co-written with Canadian author Edmund Fancott, but his name was not included in the published edition.\\"The Bulletin of the Bibliographical Society of Canada, May 2008\\", p. 9 Continuously, some of the left over material from her first novel, eventually turned into short stories. Her second novel, \\"The Lasting Spring\\", was reportedly completed in 1947 which tells another story about her music career but, was never published.

Contrasting storage methods  A persistent object store is different from file storage, where a single file may hold multiple objects. For example, a file with comma-separated values may hold many objects, generally one per line. This kind of file system opens the file from the start and reads through it to access an object in the middle. A third type of storage, block storage, works by breaking a single object up into smaller pieces for storage convenience. Whereas files are modeled after linear human documents and data streams, object storage is primarily intended to support object-oriented programming languages. These languages will maintain their own volatile object store in memory, but when the program stops or needs to make room in memory, a persistent object store can hold the objects for reuse later or by another program. Writing the objects out is called data serialization.  Variations in implementation  Simple examples store the serialized object in binary format (zeroes and ones). More complex examples include object databases or object-relational mapping systems, which combine a database system with support for easily storing objects. They may be serialized in private and obscure formats or in a widely portable formats such as XML or JSON. The most important components of a persistent object store are: * The identification of persistent objects * The properties of objects and their interconnections * The scale of the object store * The provision of stability See also Phantom OS - an operating system which is persistent object storage as a whole.

The people of this region of eastern India along the coast of the Bay of Bengal sailed up and down the Indian coast, and travelled to Indo China and throughout Maritime Southeast Asia, introducing elements of their culture to the people with whom they traded. The 6th century Manjusrimulakalpa mentions the Bay of Bengal as 'Kalingodra' and historically the Bay of Bengal has been called 'Kalinga Sagara' (both Kalingodra and Kalinga Sagara mean Kalinga Sea), indicating the importance of Kalinga in the maritime trade. The old traditions are still celebrated in the annual Bali Jatra, or Boita-Bandana festival held for seven days in October / November at various coastal districts, most famous at Cuttack though. Studies in Maritime Heritage of Odisha, 2016,OIMSEAS,  Location  Located on the eastern coast of India, the ancient state of Kalinga extended from the Ganges to the Godavari River, including parts of modern West Bengal, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh. The navigable rivers, including the Ganges, Mahanadi, Vamsadhara and Godavari provided access to the interior, where precious and semi-precious stones were found, and their deltas provided natural harbours. From these harbours, the people of the region traded by sea with Ceylon in the south, with Burma in the east, and further afield with the states of the Maritime Southeast Asia, Indochina and China. The maritime activity of Kalinga was so extensive that what is now called the Bay of Bengal was once called the Sea of Kalinga. The coastline is unstable. The southwest monsoon carries sediment along the coast, at times forming bars and spits that protect the harbours, at other times eroding the protective breakwaters. The rivers carry silt, extending their deltas and filling the former harbours. For this reason, some of the ports named in ancient times are no longer in existence, or have greatly declined. For example, Chilika Lake was an important harbour, but later became unusable by deep water vessels due to silting. Some of the ports mentioned by the geographer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD were Nanigaina (Puri), Katikardama (Kataka) and Kannagara (Konarak). Ptolemy did not refer to the important ports of Manikapatna, Palur, Chelitalo, Kalingapatnam, Pithunda and Khalkatapatna. Writing later in the 9th and 10th centuries CE, Arab sources mention Orissa, Ganjam, Kalinganagar, Keylkan, Al-Lava and Nubin. After the 15th century, ports included Balasore, Pipili, Ganjam, Harishapur, Chandabali and Dhamra.  Early history  Maurya Empire in 265 BC Excavations at Golbai Sasan have shown a Neolithic culture dating to as early as ca. 2300 BC, followed by a Chalcolithic (copper age) culture and then an Iron Age culture starting around 900 BC. Tools found at this site indicate boat building, perhaps for coastal trade. Fish bones, fishing hooks, barbed spears and harpoons show that fishing was an important part of the economy. Some artefacts of the Chalcolithic period are similar to artefacts found in Vietnam, indicating possible contact with Indochina at a very early period. Early historical sources record that Kalinga became subject to Magadha in 362 BC, regained independence during a civil war in Magadha around 320 BC, but around 261 BC was conquered by the Maurya emperor Ashoka (269 BC to 232 BC). The site at Sisupalagarh, occupied from the 3rd century BC to the 4th century AD, has been identified with Tosali, the provincial capital of Ashoka, and with Kalinganagari, the capital city of Kalinga after it regained independence from Mauryan empire early in the 1st century BC during the reign of Kharavela. The history of the following centuries is complex. At times the north and south of Kalinga were separate states, at times united. Sometimes Kalinga was independent, sometimes it was tributary to a more powerful neighbour. The Bhauma-Kara dynasty ruled over Utkal, as the northern and eastern part of Orissa was then known, from the 8th to 10th centuries AD. These rulers paid tribute to Devapala (810‚Äì850 AD), ruler of the Pala Empire of Bengal, but Utkal regained its independence from his successors. For a period, the rulers of Utkal were forced to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Tamil Chola dynasty under their king Rajendra Chola I (1012‚Äì1044), with whom they became allied by marriage. After regaining independence, Anantavarma Chodagangadeva (1078‚Äì1191) established control over a wide region from the Ganges to the Godavari, moving his capital from Kalinganagar to Cuttack. The power of Orissa waxed and waned over the following centuries, but it was not until 1586 that Orissa finally lost its independence. Ships 9th century Relief panel of a ship at Borobudur in Java, built during the Sailendra dynasty Rules and regulations regarding construction of ships were recorded in the Sanskrit Juktikalpataru (Yukti Kalpa Taru). The Madalapanji records that king Bhoja built many ships with local wood. The recovery of many woodworking adzes and other artefacts from Chilika Lake shows that Golabai was a boat- building center. Terracotta seals from Bangarh and Chandraketugarh (400 BC to 100 BC) depict seagoing vessels carrying containing corn. The ships have a single mast with a square sail. The earliest depiction of ships in Odisha is in a sculptured frieze showing two ships, found near the Brahmeswar temple, Bhubaneswar, and now preserved in the Odisha State Museum. The first ship has standing elephants in the front part, two people seated in the center and two sailor with oars at the rear steering the ship. Sea routes From June to September the summer monsoons blow from the southwest, from Ceylon towards Kalinga. From December to early March, the retreating monsoons blow in the reverse direction. Southeast Asia has similar seasonal wind patterns. Over Indonesia, in July and August the winds blow from Australia in a northwesterly direction, shifting towards a northeasterly direction as they cross the equator. The pattern reverses during January and February. Early navigators would have exploited these seasonal winds, navigating by the stars, the color of the water, the presence of sea snakes, and observation of the flights of sea crows and other homing birds. The ships of Kalinga were not able to make long sea voyages without stopping along the way for food and water. Ships outbound from Tamralipta would have followed the Burmese coast, stopping at the Nicobar islands, a one-month journey. From there, they continued to the southeast, then sailed down the Malay Peninsula and through the strait of Malacca, and onward to Java or Bali, or headed northeast to Indochina or China. An alternative route was southward down the coast of India, perhaps stopping in Ceylon, then southeast to Sumatra. Trade Palur, near the Rushikulya River in the Ganjam district, was an important port in the 2nd century AD. Archaeological exploration has unearthed fragments of Chinese celadon ware, Roman rouletted pottery and amphora pieces, showing that the port carried out significant international trade. An unusual medallion has a Kushana-style king with a Brahmi inscription on one side, and a Roman head with a Roman inscription on the other. A Roman coin of the emperor Tiberius has been found at Salihundam, and other Roman coins have been found at other sites, giving further evidence of trade with the Roman Empire. Trade with Southeast Asia was established by the 1st century AD, and may have much earlier origins. Later findings include 12th-century Ceylonese coins and 14th- century Chinese coins. Similar coins from Kotchina in Sumatra point to a triangular trade between Orissa, Ceylon and Sumatra. Trading was not without risks. The kings of Kalinga, Siam and Java had to periodically mount expeditions to put down Malay and Bugis pirates operating in the Strait of Malacca and throughout Maritime Southeast Asia. Manikapatna was a port on the banks of Chilika that flourished from early historical times until the 19th century AD. Excavations have found many types of pottery from different parts of India, and coins from Ceylon and China. The more modern levels contain Chinese celadon and porcelain, and Arabic glazed pottery. An 18th-century Mosque has an inscription saying sailors and traders prayed there before setting out on their voyages. According to a 6th-century AD source, Kalinga was famous for its elephants, for which it found a market in Ceylon, along with precious stones, ivory, pepper, betel nuts and fine textiles. In return, Kalinga imported pearl and silver from Ceylon. Corn and rice were also exported. Traders imported spices and sandalwood from the east, some if it destined for onward transport to the Mediterranean market. A boat depicted in the Sun Temple of Konarak in the 13th century contains a giraffe, indicating trade with Africa, presumably carried on Arab vessels. Overseas contacts Africa & Western World- The people of Kalinga monopolised trade in the Arabian Sea. Crossing the Arabian Sea, the Kalingans establishedtrade relations with the East Coast of Africa and with the far-off island of Madagaskar.Scholars also believe that the Maya civilizationof America was a result of commercialenterprise of Kalinga with that continent. It is, thus, gleaned from the aboveanalysis that ancient Orissa had close maritime contact with the countries of the western world.The historical links between the Malay Archipelago and Madagascar took place during the Srivijaya era. Malagasy contains loan words from Sanskrit, all with local linguistic modifications via Javanese or Malay, hint that Madagascar may have been colonized by settlers from the Srivijaya empire. At that time the Srivijayan maritime empire was expanding their maritime trade network.(Reference-Maritime Contact of Ancient Orissa with the Western World,Indonesia‚ÄìMadagascar relations). =Burma= Burma went by the name of Kalingarat (Kalinga Rastra) in the 7th century BC, and there is evidence of very early settlement in the southern Mon portion. By the 2nd century AD, the Kalingans were ruling Kalaymyo, the Arakan River valley and Pegu, around the gulf of Martaban. The remains of a ship excavated at Tante, near Yangon is thought to have belonged to Kalingan traders. Place names and similarities in architecture also indicate close contacts across the gulf of Bengal. The Buddhagat, the sacred scripture of Burma, describes trade with the Buddhist merchants of Kalinga, leading to missionaries coming to propagate the faith, and then to political domination of parts of coastal Burma by Kalinga during the 4th to 7th centuries AD. Coins with Hindu symbols found in Pegu confirm this contact. Maldives- Although the first kings of Maldives were of Solar dynasty, the last queen of the solar dynasty, Queen Damahaar married a prince from Lunar dynasty ( Soma Vansa ) who came from Kalinga thus establishing the line of Soma Vansa.In the Maldivian legend, the prince who arrived in the Maldives, was the son of Brahmaditiya, king of Kalinga (Brahmadatta, King of Kalinga at the time of Buddha's death c. 500 ‚Äì 350 BC), a kingdom on the south-east of India (modern Orissa). King Brahmaditiya was displeased with his son and sent him to Dheeva Maari (Maldives). The name of this prince was Sri Soorudasaruna. Sri Soorudasaruna established a kingdom of the Adeetha Vansha Dynasty (Solar Dynasty) in Dhiva Maari, a short period before the reign of Emperor Ashoka in India. This would place the establishment of the first kingdom in the Maldives circa the 4th century BC.(Reference-Note on the Early History of the Maldives,Naseema Mohamed ). =Java= The bas relief of 8th century Borobudur depict a King and Queen with their subjects, the scene is based on Sailendran royal court. According to R.D. Banarjee, Hindus from Kalinga took a leading role in establishing Hindu culture in Java. An expedition from Kalinga established a colony in Java in 75 BC. According to legend, there were 20,000 colonists, although this number seems implausible. These immigrants may have introduced the Hindu religion, which was established throughout the island by the 4th century AD. Chinese historians use the name Ho-Ling (Kalinga) for the leading kingdom of Java in the Tang period (618‚Äì906 AD). This kingdom may have been founded by new colonists, or may reflect the rise of the earlier colony to power. Arab historians described the 8th century AD Sailendra dynasty of Java as originating from Kalinga, and said that Sailendra was also powerful in Cambodia and Champa (Annam). A copper plate inscription dated 840 AD says the servants of the inner palace of King Kuti of Java came from Champa and Kalinga. An inscription of the King Airlangga of Java (1019‚Äì1042 AD) says people came to his kingdom from Kling (Kalinga) among other places. =Bali= Trade with Bali started much before the Christian Era. Bali had many products that were attractive to Kalinga's traders, including cinnamon, long pepper, white pepper and cardamon, pearls and gems, silk, camphor, bees wax and sandalwood. Traders from Kalinga brought muslin and other fine cloths, rugs, brocade, armour, gold and jewellery. There is a tradition that the first ruler of Bali was an Indian named Kaudinya, around 600 AD, and this name later became the title for future rulers. It is possible that the island is named after Bali, a legendary king of Orissa. Traditional masked dances that are performed in Orissa and Bali for the purpose of removing evils and bringing good fortune have many similarities that point to ancient cultural exchanges. The trade began to decline in the 8th century AD, as Arabs became the predominant maritime power in the region. The festival of \\"Bali Jatra\\", or \\"Journey to Bali\\", is still celebrated throughout coastal Orissa in memory of the ancient trading links. =Malay peninsula= Through energetic maritime campaigns, the Sailendra kings of Java were able to take control of the Malay Peninsula and part of southern Thailand. The kings welcomed Buddhist missionaries from India, accepting their teaching of the Mahayana sect, which spread through their territories. However, central and northeastern Thailand continued to adhere to the Hinayana teachings of the Theravada sect, which had been introduced by missionaries sent by the emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BC. Another theory on the introduction of Buddhism to the Malay peninsula is that after Kalinga conquered lower Burma in the 8th century their influence gradually spread down the peninsula. The Malayu language contains many words derived from the Odia language. =Cambodia= Angkor Wat viewed from the northwest Emigrants from Kalinga came to Cambodia in the 3rd century BC, fleeing from the emperor Ashoka. However, after Ashoka had converted to Buddhism and sent missionaries to Cambodia, they accepted the teachings and helped establish the religion in the region. The early monuments of the Khmers (of modern Cambodia) appear to be of Andhra origin rather than from Kalinga. However, although some of the inscriptions at Angkor Wat in Cambodia are in Sanskrit, others are in the Kalinga script. The design of the Angkor Wat temple shows influences from the Jagannath Puri temple of Odisha. =China= The first record of trade with China is found in the account of Fa Hien (399‚Äì411 AD) who sailed in a merchant vessel from the port of Temralipti back to China. The Chinese pilgrim Hieun Tsang (645 CE) tells of sea voyages from the ports of Tamralipta (modern Tamluk) and Chelitalo to Simhala (modern Sri Lanka) and China. A former king of Odra (Orissa) named Subhakararisha, who had abdicated in order to become a monk, voyaged to China in 716 AD. and introduced Tantric Buddhism. There is an account of the carriage by sea in 794 AD of a present by the King of Udra to the Emperor of China. Orissa imported silk from China, and a Chinese coin from the 8th century has been found at Sirpur. Between 813 and 818, three missions were sent from the Javanese nation of Kalinga to the court of Hsien Tung in China, bringing rarities such as a live rhinoceros, a five-coloured parrot and some black boys and girls from East Africa. =Sri Lanka= The Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy, Sri Lanka Kalinga had strong ties with Simhala (Sri Lanka). Some scholars say that the first king of Simhala, Vijaya, came from Simhapura in eastern India, the capital of Kalinga, and that his grandmother was the daughter of the king of Kalinga. The emperor Ashoka sent his son to Ceylon to establish Buddhism, and later sent his daughter Sanghamitra to organise the nuns. The Samantapasadika says that she was accompanied by eight families from Kalinga. The Dathavamsa talks of the friendship between king Guhasiva of Kalinga and king Mahasena of Ceylon (277 ‚Äì 304 AD). It also talks of the king of Kalinga giving the tooth relic of Gautama Buddha as a dowry to Dantakumara on his marriage to the king's daughter. Dantakumara took the relic to Ceylon where it was enshrined in a stupa. Hinayanic Buddhism flowered in Ceylon in the 4th and 5th centuries AD, and the influence of scholars from Ceylon spread through Burma, Siam and Cambodia, establishing the beliefs and practices that continue in these countries today. Kalinga was also strongly affected by Ceylonese culture, in particular by the Theravada teachings of Buddhaghosa, since it lay on the route followed by pilgrims from Ceylon visiting holy places in India. Pilgrims from Kalinga sailed to Ceylon to honour the sacred tooth and visit the monasteries. The Chinese pilgrim Hieun Tsang describes these sea voyages from the port of Tamralipta and Chelitalo to Simhala. According to the Chulavamsa, the king of Kalinga visited Ceylon during the reign of Aggabodhi II (610‚Äì611 AD). King Vijayabahu I of Ceylon (1055‚Äì1110 AD) married the daughter of the king of Kalinga. Nissanka Malla, son of king Gaparaja of Kalinga became ruler of Ceylon (1187‚Äì1196 AD). A prince of Kalinga named Magha invaded Ceylon with a fleet carrying 24,000 soldiers and ruled the island from 1214 to 1235 AD. Later history Between the 11th and 16th centuries CE, the name Kalinga was gradually replaced by Odra Desa, Uddisa and eventually Odisha. During the rule of Kapilendradeva (1435‚Äì1466 AD) the independent Oriya state established political supremacy over a vast territory outside the limits of geographical Orissa, ruling from the Ganges to Arcot in the south. His successors retained their hold over an extensive territory. During the rule of Prataprudradeva, from 1497 AD to 1541 AD, the kingdom extended from the Hooghly and Midnapore districts of West Bengal to the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. Odisha State Maritime Museum, Cuttack Arabian sailors began to intrude into the Bay of Bengal as early as the 8th century, and later Portuguese, Dutch, English and French ships became dominant, reducing the sailors of Orissa to the coastal trade. In 1586, the Muslim ruler of Bengal, Sulaiman Khan Karrani succeeded in conquering the land, ending its independence. Orissa was subsequently ceded to the Marathas in 1751, and came under British rule during the Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803‚Äì1805).

Much of this area is within the Utah Navajo side of San Juan County, Utah. The Special Trustee for American Indians testified to the House Committee on Natural Resources and stated that his office did not have the capacity to administer the Utah Navajo Trust Fund in a manner required by the 1933 Act. Currently, the decision to grant the Utah Dineh Corps the ability to maintain the oil-royalty trust fund is still being decided at a senatorial level in the US Senate. History According to the testimony from Ross Swimmer, it was appropriate for either the Navajo Nation or a nonprofit organization made up of Navajo citizens to serve as the trustee, thus it opened the door to will allow the Utah Navajos an opportunity they have never been able to fully experience‚Äîthat experience known as self-determination. Therefore, the Utah Dineh Corp. was established to maintain these Oil Revenue Funds http://utahdinehcorp.org/ Welcome to Utah Dineh Corporation Inc. On June 16, 2008, Navajo Nation Council Delegates Kenneth Maryboy, Davis Filfred, Mark Maryboy, and San Juan County Commissioner-Elect Phil Lyman of Blanding, Utah traveled to Washington, D.C. to present a working model of how an easy transition from the State of Utah handling Utah Navajo royalty money, to a functioning Utah Navajo organization before Congress.

The back-to-back hearings which took place in Room 628 Dirksen Senate Office Building, in Washington, D.C. Senate Bill 1690 Senate Bill 1690 is a bill to amend the Act of March 1, 1933, to transfer certain authority and resources to the Utah Dineh Corporation, and for other purposes. It is a bill sponsored by Rep. Robert Bennett(R-UT). The Utah Navajos would then utilize this non-profit organization in creating the Utah Dineh Corporation. This corporation has a board of directors with members from each Utah Chapter. The Utah Dineh Corporation is a Utah Nonprofit Corporation organized for the specific purpose of fulfilling the mandate of the 1933 and 1968 Acts. The Corporation would contract with a private investment firm for money management and establish processes whereby the money collected and investment earned will be used to further the intent of the trust fund. http://indian.senate.gov/public/_files/BENNETTstatement.pdf Statement by Senator Robert F. Bennett before the Committee on Indian Affairs Intent of the Utah Dineh Corp. The intent of S.1690 is to designate a new trustee in the manner recommend by Mr. Swimmer and, in doing so, allow the Utah Navajos to manage their own assets. San Juan County, Utah provides law enforcement, fire protection, emergency medical services, senior services, road maintenance, telecommunication and water services to the seven Utah Navajo chapters in which the Navajo Nation does not. There for the intent of this organization is to provide the monetary means in co-ordinating conjunction with the San Juan County services. As stated by Council Delegate Maryboy, \\"The prospect of being able to control millions of dollars generated in Utah, for the benefit of Utah Navajos, seems to have awakened Window Rock ºs otherwise dormant interest in its tribal members who live north of the Arizona border.\\" http://navajotimes.com/news/2009/0209/021209trustfund.php Tribe, Utah Din√© debate trust fund See also * Senate Bill 1690 * Navajo Nation  References  Category:Non-profit organizations based in Utah Category:2008 establishments in Utah ","title":"Utah Dineh Corporation Inc"},{"id":"29629112","text":"Sj√∏neset Spur () is a prominent rock spur from the Gruber Mountains, extending north along the east side of Anuchin Glacier to Lake Ober-See, in the Wohlthat Mountains of Queen Maud Land.

The pair successfully managed to keep their true sex hidden from their fellow soldiers and the military for two years while fighting in several major battles, until they were discovered and incarcerated. Soon thereafter, the women were released from prison and forced to return home. Early life Mary and Molly were cousins who grew up together in the mountains of Southwest Virginia on a typical farm, small and rural. The girls learned how to ride horses and hunt for food, and through working on the farm and helping provide for their family, became accustomed to the hard work and dedication that would be required of them in the military. In the fall of 1862, the girls' uncle decided to leave home to fight for the Union, based on his belief that the Confederacy would lose the war. Both cousins had a great deal of patriotism for their homeland and were infuriated when they realized what their uncle had done. In order to compensate for their uncle's disloyalty, twenty-two-year-old Molly, the more passionate and impulsive leader of the two, devised a plan for the pair to disguise themselves as men and enlist in the Confederate States Army. Molly was able to convince Mary, only fifteen years old at the time and more reserved than her cousin, to enlist with her. Military life The women disguised themselves by cutting their hair, wearing thick woolen shirts to conceal their figures, lowering their voices and walking like men. Mary and Molly's voices were already not much higher than those of the adolescent males who enlisted in the army, so they were not conspicuous when speaking in their slightly lower voices. The girls enlisted in the army under false identities; Mary enlisted as Tom Parker, and Molly enlisted as Bob Morgan (also listed as \\"Bob Martin\\"). Because of their riding skills they were quickly assigned to the Confederate cavalry. After less than one month in the army, Union forces captured the Confederate cavalry unit. However, within a few hours of their capture the forces of General John Hunt Morgan liberated the Confederate cavalrymen. Once they had regained their freedom, Mary and Molly switched to the infantry division. The couple fought under the command of General Jubal A. Early throughout the Shenandoah Valley. Mary and Molly fought in several key battles of the Civil War, including the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Battle of Gettysburg, and at the Spotsylvania Court House where Early and his men defeated General Burnside. Both women were commended for their fighting skill and dedication, known to their fellow soldiers as \\"gallant, first-class fighting men.\\" Mary and Molly were also known for their boldness, proclaiming \\"if all the women of the Confederacy were as patriotic as they, the country would have been free long ago.\\" Mary and Molly demonstrated their bravery several times in battle; one night while Molly was on guard duty, Union soldiers began to attack the camp. Molly promptly signaled the alarm and killed three Union soldiers with only a muzzleloader, a significant accomplishment for any soldier. Due to their heroism during the attack, Molly was promoted to sergeant, and Mary became a corporal. In order to keep their secret, Mary and Molly realized that they would have to reveal their true identities to someone in the army who could protect them. The girls chose a young captain as their confidante, who protected them from physical exams and other duties which could have put them at risk of discovery. At one point in battle, Molly was injured by a shell fragment that struck her arm. Soldiers came to aid Molly, but fearing that someone would fetch a doctor, she quickly claimed that the wound was \\"just a scratch.\\" Later Molly allowed Mary to tend to the wound, and Molly made a full recovery. Discovery and imprisonment On October 19, 1864 at the Battle of Cedar Creek, the Bells' young captain confidante was taken prisoner by the forces of General Philip Sheridan. Mary and Molly decided they needed to quickly confide in another officer and selected a young lieutenant who had recently been placed in command of their company. The lieutenant did not keep the Bells' secret, but quickly reported their status to General Early. Authorities immediately detained Mary, age seventeen, and Molly, age twenty-four, at the Confederate prison of Castle Thunder in Richmond, Virginia. Once incarcerated, Molly proclaimed that she knew of six other women in disguise within General Early's ranks. Mary and Molly claimed their only reason for enlisting in the army was patriotism, and they simply wanted to return to the army. Nevertheless, General Early claimed that the women were prostitutes or \\"common camp followers\\" and were \\"the means of demoralizing several hundred men\\" in his command. The Bells, along with other women discovered, were accused by the Richmond Daily Examiner as only assuming their disguises to \\"follow the army and hide their iniquity,\\" and were even blamed for General Early's failure in the 1864 Shenandoah Valley campaign. The Bells' comrades vouched that the pair had \\"done good service as soldiers without at all exciting suspicions... as to their sex.\\" Even extreme conservative activist Edmund Ruffin thought Mary and Molly Bell \\"proved themselves fine soldiers... and should be allowed to stay in the service.\\" After three weeks of imprisonment, no specific charges were brought against Mary and Molly. As a result, the cousins were released from Castle Thunder. They were not permitted to re-enter the army, and were instead sent back on their horses to Pulaski, dressed in the same Confederate uniforms in which they were imprisoned.

Belton Park is located north of the centre of Grantham, Lincolnshire, England. The site of the Depot was on farmland on the opposite side of Londonthorpe Lane from the Park. History As early as the 1920s the RAF had formed small airfield defence units but traditionally the role of ground defence had predominantly been handled by detachments of regular army personnel. In the Second World War it became evident in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation that the army did not have the resources, personnel or expertise to continue supporting the growing number of UK and overseas RAF airfields and the decision was taken to form a dedicated RAF defence force. In January 1942 King George VI signed a Royal Warrant for \\"a Corps formed as an integral part of the RAF\\", and the RAF Regiment was born. The first Depot was opened in Filey with instructional staff seconded from the Brigade of Guards and the Royal Marines. The Depot moved to Belton Park in 1942. During the First World War Belton Park had been a training centre for the Machine Gun CorpsMGC History and had housed and trained 18,000 men. During the First World War the hundreds of temporary wooden huts had been built over the Belton Park Golf Course's fairways and a highly detailed map of the site remains on display in the current golf course clubhouse.

After spending almost ten years working for the Saunders-Roe company, he was killed in 1958 while test flying the SR.53, an experimental interceptor. Early life Born on 9 December 1919 near Huddersfield in Yorkshire, Booth joined the Royal Air Force in 1938 on a short service commission and in October 1939 he was sent to France with 59 Squadron as part of the British Expeditionary Force. During the Battle of France, he was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for his gallantry. Wounded in May 1940, Booth was sent back to England for convalescence, and after recovering, was posted to Canada where he served a number of tours as a flying instructor. In 1943 he returned to operations. For the next two years he flew night fighters and intruder operations with No. 100 (Bomber Support) Group, for which he was awarded a bar to his D.F.C. Test Pilot After his tours with Bomber Command, he was posted to \\"A\\" Squadron at Boscombe Down in late 1944. In 1945, he was a student on the third course run at the Empire Test Pilots' School. Following his demobilisation from the Royal Air Force in 1946 he joined Power Jets as a test pilot. He moved to Short Brothers, initially at Rochester, but later Belfast. For the next two years he conducted most of the test flying on the Sturgeon, carried out development of the Solent, and flew the civil version of the Shetland. In February 1949 Booth joined Saunders-Roe as deputy to their chief test pilot Geoffrey Tyson. In this role, he assisted with test flying of the Saunders-Roe SR.A/1, the world's first jet flying boat fighter, and the development flying of the Princess. In January 1956 Tyson retired and Booth was appointed the chief test pilot. In this role, Booth was responsible for the development flying of the Saunders-Roe SR.53 mixed power interceptor. He made the maiden flight of the first prototype (XD145) on 16 May 1957, demonstrated it at the Farnborough (S.B.A.C) air-show in September and made the first flight of the second prototype (XD151) on 6 December 1957. On the fifth of June, 1958, Booth was testing XD151. During take off its rocket engine failed and it overrun the runway at Boscombe Down. During the accident, the SR.53 hit a landing light, rupturing its fuel tanks and burst into flames, Booth was killed in the fire.

He worked with the Southern Tenant Farmers Union, founded the People's Institute for Applied Religion, and served as the national vice president of the American Federation of Teachers. He was also the director of Commonwealth College in Mena, Arkansas, from 1937‚Äì1939. As a young fundamentalist preacher in the rural South, Williams' initial motivation was the spiritual salvation of his parishioners, or in his words, to ‚Äúsave their never-dying, ever-precious souls from the devil‚Äôs hell eternal.‚ÄùStuds Terkel, Hard Times: An Oral History of the Great Depression. New York, Pantheon Books, 1970, pages 328-332. This motivation later evolved into a quest for social justice for the poor throughout society, leading to confrontations with white supremacists and lifelong charges of Communist activities. As Williams put it, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been run out of the best communities, fired from the best churches, and flogged by the best citizens of the South.‚Äù  Early life  Williams was born in rural Weakley County, Tennessee. His parents, Jess and Minnie Bell Williams, were sharecroppers and members of the fundamentalist Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Williams enlisted in the army in 1916. He became a drill sergeant and trainer of draftees, re-enlisting in 1919. After leaving the army in 1921 he entered Bethel College, a small Cumberland Presbyterian seminary. While studying for the ministry he became an accomplished evangelical preacher.Cedric Belfrage, A Faith to Free the People, Dryden Press, 1944. At Bethel he met Joyce King, a missionary student from Mississippi, whom he married in 1922. After graduating from Bethel in 1924, Williams gained his first pastorate at a Presbyterian church in Auburntown, Tennessee.  Career Transition  In 1927, Williams read Harry Emerson Fosdick's Modern Use of the Bible. Fosdick interpreted the Bible as a militant social text, de-emphasizing a literalist interpretation and advocating societal progress and change. Williams credited this book as a turning point in his life.Claude Williams papers, Walter P. Reuther Library, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan Williams was also influenced by seminars held by Dr. Alva W. Taylor at the Vanderbilt School of Religion. Taylor was a noted social activist and proponent of the Social Gospel, a movement that applied Christian ethics to social problems. At Vanderbilt the concept of Jesus as the ‚ÄúSon of Man‚Äù made a profound impression on Williams. Referring to Dr. Taylor, Williams said, ‚ÄúHe cleared the debris of theological crap and let Him rise among us as a challenging human leader.‚Äù In 1930, the Presbytery assigned Williams to a small church located in Paris, Arkansas. The church community consisted of poor miners, sharecroppers, and a few black families. Williams was determined to organize local miners, and through his efforts the congregation grew rapidly. However, church and community leaders were opposed to the influx of impoverished workers from surrounding areas, and were shocked by the prospect of mixed race services. As a result, the Presbytery removed Williams from the church. In 1935, Williams was assigned to a church in Fort Smith, Arkansas. Here Williams and eight others were arrested for organizing a hunger march for unemployed workers. He was fined one hundred dollars, served ninety days in jail, and was tried for heresy by the Presbytery.Angela D. Dillard, Faith in the City: Preaching Radical Social Change in Detroit, pages 140-152. University of Michigan Press, 2007. After his release from prison, Williams went to Little Rock, Arkansas where he trained sharecroppers and other workers as grassroots organizers. In 1936 Williams founded the New Era School for Social Action and Prophetic Religion. He also worked with the Southern Tenant Farmers Union to raise funds and promote schools. During this time Williams also served as vice-president of the American Federation of Teachers. In June 1936, while traveling to Memphis to prepare the funeral for a black sharecropper who had been beaten to death, Williams was stopped by five sheriff's deputies and was himself severely beaten. Afterward he was forced to sign a statement that he hadn't been hurt, and was not allowed to continue to Memphis. In 1937, Williams was appointed director of Commonwealth College in Mena, Arkansas. He remained in that position for two years, resigning in 1939 after accusations of Communist sympathies.  The PIAR and Detroit  In 1940, Williams reorganized his New Era school as the People's Institute of Applied Religion (PIAR). The PIAR organized rural farmers and industrial workers, using Williams' skills as a minister to reach workers through their religious beliefs. The organization worked closely with the sharecropper movement and supported CIO activism in the South. The PIAR received support from Reinhold Niebuhr and Harry Ward, the Methodist Federation for Social Action, the Church League for Industrial Democracy, and the National Religion and Labor Foundation. Williams attempted to blend religious piety with social activism. As he noted in later years: :‚ÄúWe were realistic, or at least we tried to be. We discovered that the fact that people believed in the Bible literally could be used to an advantage‚Ä¶.Being so-called fundamentalists, accepting the Bible verbatim, had nothing whatsoever to do with a person‚Äôs understanding of the issues that related to bread and meat, raiment, shelter, jobs and civil liberties. Therefore, our approach was not an attempt to supplant their present mindset, but to supplement it with a more horizontal frame of reference. And we found that supplementing and supplanting turned out to be the same thing.‚Äù The message of the PIAR was spread by a network of black and white preachers using visual aid charts and sermon outlines, presenting biblically-based aspects of social justice in simple terms. In 1942, the Detroit Presbytery asked Williams to become an ‚Äúindustrial chaplain‚Äù ministering to the needs of southerners who had come north to work in the auto plants. Williams brought his PIAR organization along, and spent three years working with laborers, unions, and the black community. Accused by Gerald L. K. Smith and others of Communist activities, Williams was fired by the Presbytery in 1945.  Later career  In 1946, Williams returned south to Birmingham, Alabama, where he established a Bible training program and continued his work with the PIAR. In 1953 Williams was again accused of being a Communist, this time by the House Un-American Activities Committee.Time magazine: ‚ÄúReligion: Finding of Heresy‚Äù. March 1, 1954. A subsequent trial by the Detroit Presbytery did not address the issue of Communism but did find Williams guilty of heresy. He was defrocked as a minister and not reinstated until 1965.  Final Years  During the 1950s and 1960s, Williams was active in the civil rights movement, working to register black voters, organize protests against police brutality, and help black farmers keep their land. Living with his wife in their trailer home near the rural community of Alabaster south of Birmingham, Williams‚Äô financial support came from funds raised by the Claude Williams Committee. Williams' wife died in 1976. He continued work until his own death in 1979.

Dahler or Frits Dahler, was one of the leading Indo (Eurasian) politicians and activists advocating integration of the native Indo-European community into the indigenous society of the Dutch East Indies (now: Indonesia). After World War II he changed his name to Amir Dachlan. Together with E.F.E. Douwes Dekker, he was a strong political proponent of association between Indo-Europeans and Indonesians in the colonial Dutch East Indies and early post-colonial Indonesia. Historical context :See also Indos in pre- colonial history From pre-colonial times (16th, 17th and 18th centuries) up to the first century of formal colonisation of the Dutch East Indies (19th century) the Eurasian hybrid culture of Indo-Europeans was very closely related to the indigenous cultures of the Indies archipelago. Although Indos were part of the European legal class its lingua franca and much of its practices and beliefs were derived from its indigenous maternal lineage.Taylor, Jean Gelman. The Social World of Batavia: European and Eurasian in Dutch Asia (Madison: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1983). :See also Indos in colonial history In the 20th century the assault on Indo culture in the Dutch East Indies to Westernise accelerated, rapidly enforcing a one-sided identification with Dutch culture rigorously imposed by the ruling colonial authorities. From their historic role as indispensable intermediaries and change agents, the Indos were increasingly reduced to a marginal position in colonial society.Willems, Wim Sporen van een Indisch verleden (1600‚Äì1942). (Publisher: COMT, Leiden, 1994). Simultaneously the Dutch Ethical Policy created an educated indigenous elite increasingly voicing the idea of Indonesian national independence. For the relatively small Indo-European community (less than 0.5% of the total native population) this posed the challenge of positioning itself between the emerging forces of the Indonesian National Awakening and the repressive forces of the colonial power. Throughout the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies in World War II and the following Indonesian revolution the existing estrangement between the native Indo-European population and indigenous peoples only widened and intensified. In the first half of the 20th century during both the Dutch and Japanese colonial period as well as the Indonesian revolution Dahler was one of the leading Indo-European figures voicing the idea of so-called 'Association' i.e. integration of the Indo-Europeans into the indigenous population. Pre‚ÄìWorld War II Dahler was born on 21 February 1883 in Semarang. He spoke several indigenous languages and had risen to the rank of 'Controleur' in the colonial civil service in the Dutch East Indies. In 1918 he befriended famous politician and activist E.F.E. Douwes Dekker and became a leader of the new National Indische Party. 1922 he became that party's delegate in the People's Assembly (Dutch: Volksraad). In 1938 he was an editor of the Malay language weekly 'Penindjauan'. Here he befriended the indigenous intellectuals Amir and Sam Ratulangi. At the same time he was editor in chief of the Malay language paper 'Bintang Timoer' (English: Eastern Star). He was also a teacher in amongst others Douwes Dekker‚Äôs ‚ÄòKsatrian‚Äô schools as well as the ‚ÄòPergoeroean Rakjat‚Äô schools.Touwen-Bouwsma, E. ‚ÄúJapanese minority policy; The Eurasians on Java and the dilemma of ethnic loyalty.‚Äù 152, no.4. (Publisher: KITLV, Leiden, 1996) P.39 World War II During the Japanese occupation in World War II the Japanese found it hard to determine their position regarding the Eurasian population of the Dutch East Indies.Touwen-Bouwsma, E. \\"Japanese minority policy; The Eurasians on Java and the dilemma of ethnic loyalty.\\" 152, no.4. (Publisher: KITLV, Leiden, 1996) P.39 Hesitant to imprison the relatively large number of Indos and in need of an administrative backbone to support their occupation of the outstretched and populous archipelago their initial stance towards the Indos was one of relative leniency. The Japanese clearly chose to focus on their Asian descent, rather than their European descent and continued to groom the Indos through much of the occupation. Their attempts had little to no avail as Indos continued to cling to their western heritage. In contrast the Eurasian community in neighbouring Malaya, that was hectored and admonished in the same way as the Indos in the 'Japanese East Indies', but that did not constitute any serious problem for the Japanese occupier.Jones, F.C. \\"Japan's new order in Asia. Its rise and fall 1937‚Äì1945.\\"(Publisher: Oxford University Press, 1954) P.386. During this whole period Dahler remained consistent in his beliefs of association and continued to call for integration of Indos into indigenous Indonesian society. Dahler himself in fact preferred the term ‚ÄòEurasian‚Äô iso the more common term ‚ÄòIndo-European‚Äô wanting to emphasise the Asian element of Indos. He became the leader of the pro- Indonesian Indo movement and throughout the occupation attempted to elucidate the Japanese and Indonesian viewpoints.Note: In 1943‚Äì1944 the Japanese chose to recognise Dahler as leader of the Indo-European community. Together with Sukarno he called for their \\"Indo brethren\\" to join with the Indonesians in establishing the Japanese envisioned 'Asian Sphere of Prosperity'. See:Meijer, Hans In Indi√´ geworteld. De 20ste eeuw. (Publisher: Bert Bakker, Amsterdam, 2004) P.218-219 In August 1943 Dahler became head of the so-called 'Kantor Oeroesan Peranakan' (KOP), 'Office for Indo Matters' also more commonly known as the 'Dahler Office'. 'Belanda-Indo' (Dutch-Indo) the earlier Malay term used by the Japanese for Indos was now changed to 'Peranakan' (Descendant). In September 1943 Indos were officially labelled 'non-hostile', and the Japanese promised to release Indos from their civilian prison camps. Additionally, Indos were allowed to cash in 30% of their bank savings and send their children to school again. During another round of Japanese registration in October 1943, Indos had to provide proof demonstrating at least 7 Indo or indigenous ancestors.Meijer, Hans In Indi√´ geworteld. De 20ste eeuw. (Publisher: Bert Bakker, Amsterdam, 2004) P.220-221 Still many Indonesians believed that the deeply rooted differences between themselves and the Indos could not be eradicated overnight, simultaneously the reactionary response of many Indos was to straight out reject the idea of being equated with Indonesians. Sentiments in the Indo community were hurled to and fro between pro- or anti Dutch and pro- or anti Indonesian and Japanese feelings. Overall the majority of Indos remained fiercely proud of their European roots and opposed both Japanese and Indonesian attempts to denounce their western identity.Touwen-Bouwsma, E. ‚ÄúJapanese minority policy; The Eurasians on Java and the dilemma of ethnic loyalty.‚Äù 152, no.4.

The older Dahler, who was known to be a quiet and amiable man, did not take a liking to the militant and sometimes harsh approach of the newcomers, but was unable to temper it, as Van den Eeckhout was being directly instructed by the Japanese.Meijer, Hans In Indi√´ geworteld.

(Publisher: Bert Bakker, Amsterdam, 2004) P.234 Post WWII Dahler was the only Indo who participated in the ‚ÄòCommittee for the Study of Preparations for Independence‚Äô (BPUPK) led by Sukarno and established by the Japanese in May 1945.Note: 1 March Badan Penyelidik Usaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan (BPUPK), the committee to prepare for Indonesian Independence, was announced by the Japanese and first chaired by Dr. Radjiman Wediodiningrat. Other notable members included Sukarno, Hatta, Wahid Hasyim, Dahlers. After Indonesia's declaration of independence Dahler was a member of the political section of the Indonesian National Party (PNI). Together with independence leaders Sukarno and Sjahrir he continued to groom Indos to join the national revolution, but their efforts were undone by extremist revolutionary forces during the violent Bersiap period.Meijer, Hans In Indi√´ geworteld. De 20ste eeuw. (Publisher: Bert Bakker, Amsterdam, 2004) P.242 February 1946 Dahler was arrested in Batavia by the Dutch and accused of collaboration with Japan. Although the Dutch considered him morally culpable, no actual criminal grounds for conviction were found and he was eventually granted amnesty. In May 1947 Dahler moved to Republican territory and was reunited with his old friend Douwes Dekker, who had secretly returned from exile. Dahler died on 7 June 1948 in Jogjakarta without witnessing the official transfer of Dutch authority to the Indonesian Republic.Meijer, Hans In Indi√´ geworteld. De 20ste eeuw. (Publisher: Bert Bakker, Amsterdam, 2004) P.265 After Indonesian independence in 1949 the young nation continued to face economic downturn and contra- revolutionary turmoil threatening its national unity. Sukarno‚Äôs reactionary policy of anti-Dutch confrontation indirectly stimulated anti-Indo sentiments leading to the Indo diaspora. Ironically in an effort to reduce repatriation of Indos to the Netherlands the Dutch government now actively promoted Indonesian citizenship for Indo-Europeans, the very idea Dahler had always fought for. Dahler's tireless efforts to persuade Indo-Europeans to associate themselves with the indigenous peoples were often misconstrued as acts of betrayal, causing much resentment among his fellow Indo compatriots. Over the years his stance has been largely vindicated by advancing historic insights and more objective reflective analysis.Meijer, Hans In Indi√´ geworteld. De 20ste eeuw.

The chemical formula is . In comparison, Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene), -(CF2)n-, consists of carbon \\"chains\\" with each carbon bound to two fluorines. Unlike fluorographene, graphene is unsaturated (sp2 hybridized) and completely carbon. The hydrocarbon analogue to fluorographene is sp3 hybridized graphane. Similar to other fluorocarbons (e.g. perfluorohexane), fluorographene is highly insulating. Fluorographene is thermally stable, resembling polytetrafluoroethylene; however, chemically it is reactive. It can be transformed back into graphene by reaction with KI under higher temperature. During reactions of fluorographene with NaOH and NaSH simultaneous reductive defluorination and substitution are observed. The reactivity of fluorographene represents a facile way towards graphene derivatives. Preparation The material was first described in 2010 by Robinson et al. using graphene grown on copper foil exposed to xenon difluoride at 30 ¬∞C. The group of Nair et al. started from cleaved graphene crystals on a gold grid also exposed to xenon difluoride, at 70 ¬∞C. Also in 2010 Withers et al. described exfoliation of fluorinated graphite (monolayer, 24% fluorination) and Cheng et al. reported reversible graphene fluorination.Reversible fluorination of graphene: Evidence of a two-dimensional wide band gap semiconductor S.-H.

B 2010; 81, 205435 The stoichiometric fluorographene (CF) was also prepared by chemical exfoliation of graphite fluoride by Zboril et al. Zboril et al. also showed that the graphene fluoride can be transformed into graphene via graphene iodide, a spontaneously decomposing intermediate. Structure Structure of fluorographene can be derived from the structure of graphite monofluoride , which consists of weakly bound stacked fluorographene layers, and its most stable conformation (predicted for the monocrystal) contains an infinite array of trans-linked cyclohexane chairs with covalent C‚ÄìF bonds in an AB stacking sequence.Karlicky F, Datta KKR, Otyepka M, Zboril R Halogenated Graphenes: Rapidly Growing Family of Graphene Derivatives.

In addition, fluorescence and NEXAFS measurements indicate band gap higher than 3.8 eV. Theoretical calculations show that estimation of fluorographene band gap is rather challenging task, as GGA functional provides band gap of 3.1 eV, hybrid (HSE06) 4.9 eV, GW 8.1 eV on top of PBE 8.1 or 8.3 eV on top of HSE06. The optical transition calculated by Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) is equal to 5.1 eV and points to an extremely strong exciton binding energy of 1.9 eV. It has recently been demonstrated that using fluorographene as a passivation layer in Field Effect Transistors (FETs) featuring a graphene channel, carrier mobility increases significantly. Reaction Fluorographene is susceptible for nucleophilic substitution and reductive defluorination, which makes it an extraordinary precursor material for synthesis of large portfolio of graphene derivatives. Both chemical channels can be used to chemically manipulate with fluorographene and they can be tuned by suitable conditions, e.g., solvent.Matochov√° D, Medved M, Aristides B, Stekl√Ω T, Zbo≈ôil R, Otyepka M 2D Chemistry - Chemical Control of Graphene Derivatization. J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2018, 9 (13), pp 3580‚Äì3585 . In 2010 it was shown that fluorographene can be transformed to graphene by treatment with KI.

ACS Nano, 2017, 11 (3), pp 2982‚Äì2991 Other halogenated graphenes Recent studies have also revealed that, similar to fluorination, full chlorination of graphene can be achieved. The resulting structure is called chlorographene. However other theoretical calculations questioned stability of chlorographene under ambient conditions. Also graphene can be fluorinated or halofluorinated by CVD-method with fluorocarbons, hydro- or halofluorocarbons by heating while in contact of carbon material with fluoroorganic substance to form partially fluorinated carbons (so called Fluocar materials).

He is best known for authoring The Cowboy's Trail Guide to Westerns and Nelson Point: Portrait of a Northern Gold Rush Town. Other works include writings in the areas of kinesiology, elementary education, philosophy of sports ethics, and performance-enhancing drugs. Matuszak is also known as an avid outdoorsman, environmentalist, and political activist. He is the founder of the Californio Ranch Roping Club and the president of the Friends of Live Oak Canyon. Early years Matuszak is the youngest of three sons born to retired school teachers, Frank and Vera Matuszak. His childhood was influenced by Western culture. In The Cowboy's Trail Guide to Westerns, he remembers his early years during the golden years of the Hollywood Western. Many afternoons were spent playing Cowboys and Indians. ‚ÄúI was 6 years old...and riding with the ‚ÄòArdendale Kids.‚Äô We were a tough bunch. Riding Schwinn ponies with our Mattel ‚ÄòFanner Fifties‚Äô strapped to our side, we roamed the length of Ardendale Avenue in the suburbs of Los Angeles every afternoon from three to five.‚Äù Matuszak, David F. Centennial Edition: The Cowboy‚Äôs Trail Guide to Westerns, 2003, p. vii. Matuszak attended Holy Angels parochial school located directly across from Santa Anita thoroughbred racetrack. The racetrack culture further fostered his love of horses and the West. In the summer of 1960 at the age of six, he began nearly two decades of annual retreats to the backwoods of the Oregon Cascades. There the family operated Moose Creek Boys' Ranch. At ‚Äúthe ranch‚Äù he learned to shoot, horseback ride, fish, pan for gold, log, and other frontier skills that would shape his adulthood. At the ranch he became an NRA competition range master at the age of fourteen. During his eighth grade confirmation at Holy Angels church, Matuszak, born without a middle name, chose Francis as his confirmation name because of his admiration for Saint Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals, nature, and the environment. Thereafter, he used the name David F. Matuszak. The son of a high school coach, Matuszak was exposed to a wide variety of sports at an early age. He excelled in baseball and wrestling. At the age of eighteen he became a southern California (CIF) high school wrestling official. Matuszak earned a bachelor's and master's degree in Kinesiology from California State University, Long Beach. Later he earned his doctorate degree in both Western history and exercise science. In 1977, Matuszak left Long Beach to accept a head wrestling coach and teaching position at Yucaipa High School. In 2010 he began his 34th year on the staff. Matuszak's teaching position allowed ample vacation time to pursue frontier adventures. During the 1980s, Matuszak performed with The California Bounty Hunters. The Bounty Hunters were widely recognized throughout the 1960s 70s, and 80s as one of the most authentic Wild West re-enactor shows in the country.Matuszak, David F. Centennial Edition: The Cowboy‚Äôs Trail Guide to Westerns, 2003, p. 45.

Frontiersman ‚ÄúMatuszak‚Äôs fascination with frontier life has taken him all over the West. During each experience he duplicated wherever possible an authentic frontier adventure. Breaking and training horses then packing them across the West. Whether it was riding in a modern Old West show, training and riding horses with Mexican charros, riding with the mounted posse, competing in shooting competitions with Old West weapons, bowhunting or just stretching barbed wire in the desert southwest, nearly every aspect of his life has contributed to his understanding of frontier life.‚Äù Matuszak, David F.

During the summer of 1981, while packing across the Cascades on horseback, he encountered a gold prospector dredging in a mountain stream where he learned to pan as a child. The following summer he filed mining claims in both the Cascades and Sierra Nevada Mountains. Matuszak partook in the modern gold rush of the early 1980s. During that time he began the research for his doctoral dissertation about the California Gold Rush. That research led to his classic gold rush history, Nelson Point: Portrait of a Northern Gold Rush Town.Matuszak, David F. Nelson Point: Portrait of a Northern Gold Rush Town, 1993, p. IX. Wishing to experience the last two frontiers remaining in North America before they disappeared, Matuszak planned expeditions to Baja California, and Alaska. Soon after learning to surf in the early 1970s at Huntington Beach, California, Matuszak grew fond of the Baja frontier. He made regular surfing safaris there for decades. In the 1990s, he became one of the earliest participants in the building of an American surfer's colony at Punta San Jacinto where today he regularly surfs and visits his Mexican vaquero friends.Rhodes, Cindy (July 19, 2001) ‚ÄúSurfing 101‚Äù Press Enterprise: p.

In the summer of 1991, Matuszak made a solo prospecting expedition to the Brooks Range in Alaska. Legendary bush pilot, John Hankee, flew him from Bettles to the Glacier River. Hankee left Matuszak and his German Shepherd dog on the banks of the Glacier River. Midway through the expedition, Matuszak was burned out by wildfires. He packed nearly 30 miles to safety at a remote mining site where he hitched a ride to an oil pipeline truck stop. It was there when the smoke cleared that Hankee landed his Piper Cub plane and retrieved Matuszak.Matuszak, David F. (1991) ‚ÄúAlaskan Expedition Journal‚Äù Unpublished.

They then left the Southwest Conference prior to the 1918, but continued to compete within the TIAA until 1925, when the departure of Rice caused the TIAA to split. At that point, Southwestern helped form the Texas Conference along with Austin College, Howard Payne University, Simmons University (now Hardin‚ÄìSimmons University), and Trinity University. Southwestern would remain in the Texas Conference until its football program was disbanded on April 27, 1951. Prior to the 1940s, Southwestern was considered a \\"small time\\" football program, and only received national media attention about once yearly, whenever it faced a major college team.Small Schools Top Southwest Football, The Daily Times, October 21, 1943. During the Second World War, however, Southwestern became a formidable football power because of its sponsorship of a V-12 Navy College Training Program, which was gained through the actions of then Texas Congressman Lyndon B. Johnson. The Navy program gave it a pool of experienced and skilled players, which was a competitive advantage over other teams that fielded men too young or physically unfit for military service.Southwestern Rated High, Eugene Register-Guard, October 5, 1943.Texas Strong, Reading Eagle, September 5, 1943.

After coming to the attention of hip hop producer Hank Shocklee, member of the Bomb Squad, which produced early Public Enemy albums, they chose the name Son of Bazerk. The group released a debut album in 1991 called Bazerk, Bazerk, Bazerk, credited to Son of Bazerk featuring No Self Control and the Band, which was produced by the Bomb Squad. The album received some positive reviews yet it did not sell well. Almost 20 years later, the group reunited and released an album produced by DJ Johnny Juice, who produced the latest Public Enemy albums, on Chuck D's label Slam Jamz. That comeback was praised by some media, such as The Village Voice and Time Out. Half Pint has become a teacher and administrator at Roosevelt High School, Roosevelt, Long Island.

The Commission was critical of Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller for not visiting the prison before ordering an armed assault on the facility, and was also critical of state prison authorities for not having proper procedures in place to respond to riots. From 1975 onwards, McKay worked primarily for the Aspen Institute, a well-known think tank. Civic involvement McKay served in a number of prominent positions in civic life, including chairman of the New York Civil Liberties Union, president of the Legal Aid Society, and chairman of the Citizens Union.\\"Law Dean Named Citizens Union Head\\".

A railway route between Wigan and the town of Preston, in the form of the Wigan & Preston Railway, was authorised by Parliament on 22 April 1831; but before it was built, this company amalgamated with the WBR under an Act of 22 May 1834, to form the North Union Railway (NUR) - the first railway amalgamation to be sanctioned by Act of Parliament. The line was opened throughout between Wigan and on 31 October 1838, and Boar's Head station opened the same day; it was the first station on the route to the north of Wigan. The Lancashire Union Railway route between Wigan and via was authorised on 25 July 1864; it opened on 1 November 1869 for goods trains, and one month later, on 1 December, passenger services began. The LUR diverged from the NUR to the south of Boar's Head station, where additional platforms were provided for this route. Trains on the section between Wigan and , via Boar's Head, were operated by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). The section of the NUR between Parkside and Euxton Junction, which included Boar's Head station, was transferred to the LNWR on 26 July 1889. The station closed on 31 January 1949.

She has been in active rodeo competition since 1964. She has earned numerous titles at competitions such as the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) and events sanctioned by the National Barrel Horse Association (NBHA), and Women's Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA). She also competed in barrel racing as an exhibition event during the 1988 Calgary Olympics, and is the founder and co-owner of the Josey Ranch Barrel Racing Clinic. She was inducted into the Rodeo Hall of Fame of the Cowgirl Hall of Fame in 1985.National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame - Martha Josey She and her husband, R.E. Josey, were jointly inducted into the Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame in 2002, and the Texas Rodeo Cowboy Hall of Fame in 2007.Texas Rodeo Cowboy Hall of Fame Inductees She was inducted into the Rodeo Hall of Fame of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in 2011. Early years Josey is originally from the Kilgore/Marshall, Texas area. Her love for horses was instilled by her father, who was one of the first directors for the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA), and she began riding on a pony at a very early age. At age 10, Josey experienced the loss of a parent when her father died due to a heart attack. Josey's mother kept one of the family's horses, a gelding named CeBe Reed. After attending a rodeo in her teens, Josey became inspired to compete in the sport and began to work with CeBe Reed as a barrel racing horse. Martha married R.E. Josey in 1967, and the pair are still married. He was a three-time AQHA World Champion in calf roping, and now competes in team roping.\\"Smash Success\\" Connie Hubbard. American Cowboy Sep-Oct 1999, pp 18, 26 Career Her first barrel horse, CeBe Reed, took her to 52 consecutive wins, and the awards she was given included seven horse trailers. Josey and CeBe competed in the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) in 1968 and 1969, winning $3,421 in prize money in 1969. Josey claims this horse is the reason she was able to quit her job and go pro. Her second horse, Sonny Bit O'Both, brought her to the NFR four consecutive years (1978-1981). Sonny is the only horse in history to win both the AQHA and the WPRA championships in the same year. In 1980, she won the World Barrel Racing Champion title at the NFR, the highest barrel racing title in professional barrel racing.2017 Barrel Racing Records, World Records & Season Stats ‚Äì World Champion Barrel Racers ‚Äì 1980 World Champion, p. 9. With the horse Jetonfer Pay, Josey won the Pro Tour Circuit in 1985, went to the NFR again, and was inducted into the Cowgirl Hall of Fame. Josey and Swen Sir Bug, aka \\"J.C.\\", competed in the 1987 NFR. At the 1988 Winter Olympics held in Calgary, Alberta, she participated in a barrel racing exhibition as an Olympic special event where she and J.C. earned a gold medal. In June 1988, Josey suffered a serious accident at a rodeo in Austin, Texas. Doctors discovered two skull fractures, a broken pelvis, six broken ribs, and a punctured lung. Though told she might not walk again and certainly never ride, she proved her doctors wrong. She worked out daily in the swimming pool with the help of her husband, and regained enough strength to not only ride again, but also to compete professionally. After her accident, however, Josey became a strong advocate of equestrian helmet use and endorses Troxel riding helmets and safety gear.Josey AccidentTroxel Helmet news After her successful recovery, her next horse, Mr. Revolution Bars, accompanied her to the 1989 and 1990 NFR, making her one of only two barrel racers to ever compete in the NFR in four consecutive decades. After that, Orange Smash carried her to a championship in the NBHA Senior World Championship 1997 and to the NFR in 1998. In 1999, she was received the Dennis D. High Lifestyle Achievements Award and was chosen as the Women's Sports Foundation AQHA Female Equestrian of the Year. In addition, Orange Smash received 1999 AQHA \\"Best of America‚Äôs Horse Award\\" and was created as a model horse by Peter Stone. In 2000, she entered her fifth decade of competition with the horse, Joe B Jammin, and in that year ran the fastest time at the Lone Star Finals. They went on to be the Go Round Winner at the 2001 Copenhagen Cup Finale in Dallas, Texas. In 2002, she placed first and second in the NBHA Holiday Classic in Jackson, Mississippi, riding Joe B. Jammin and Sweet Sailin' Six, and 2003 ended with a championship in the Equus America competition in Houston, Texas, as well as a reserve championship in the AQHA World rodeo event in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In 2004, she obtained Red Man Bay, and the pair won the 2004 NBHA Holiday Classic Sr. 1 D Championship in Jackson, Mississippi, and went on to win the 2004 and 2005 NBHA Sr. Division Reserve World Championships. As of 2009, Josey was still competing in barrel racing. Business enterprises Presently, Martha and R.E. Josey reside in Karnack, Texas, where they own the Josey Ranch. They train and market barrel-racing and roping horses. At the ranch, and at various other places around the United States, the Joseys, along with \\"The Josey Team\\" of previous students, hold clinics for aspiring barrel racers and calf ropers to improve their skills and learn more about these events. The Josey Clinic was the first barrel-racing clinic in the sport, and has assisted thousands of riders over a 40-year period. As of 2010, the Joseys claim a total of 80,000 student have passed through their clinics and ranch competitions. However, it is unclear how this figure was calculated. The Josey Ranch sponsors several competitions, including the Josey Jr. World Championship Barrel Race for youth age 20 and under and the Josey Reunion Round-Up. Martha Josey has also recorded several videos, written books, and has appeared in magazines such as Western Horseman. Both R.E. and Martha have also had television appearances on ESPN, RFD-TV, and other networks.

The areas which were worst affected were the Swedish province of Finland and Norrland in Sweden proper. The Great Famine of 1695‚Äì1697 was concurrent with the \\"seven ill years\\", a period of national famine in Scotland in the 1690s. Estonia Finland In the Swedish province of Finland, the Great Famine of 1695‚Äì97 was also referred to as \\"The Years of Many Deaths\\" by some Finnish historians, because it killed about a third of the Finnish population in only two years, or about 150,000.Topelius, Zacharias (1899). ‚ÄùStora hungersn√∂den‚Äù.

Sweden From 1688 onward, Sweden had been affected by early frost and bad harvests. This culminated in the winter of 1695, which was described as the coldest since 1658 and the rye did not flower before July. Because of this, the Great Famine of 1695 is also referred to as Det stora svart√•ret (\\"The Great Black Year\\"). The harvest of 1696, furthermore, was reportedly so bad that each farm produced only one loaf of rye bread. Outside of Finland, the northernmost provinces of Sweden were the most severely affected. Desperate famine victims from the countryside left for the cities in search for food, especially to the capital of Stockholm, where in the spring of 1697 the streets were reportedly strewn with corpses and people dying of starvation. Israel Kolmodin wrote the psalm Den blomstertid nu kommer in 1695 in connection to the famine, intended as a prayer to God that the next summer would bring food. Causes The 1690s marked the lowest point of the Little Ice Age, of colder and wetter weather.I. D. White, \\"Rural Settlement 1500‚Äì1770\\", in M.

The roundabout was famous for being the habitat for a large group of feral chickens, which were fed and cared for by a local man until their numbers declined and they were relocated in 2010. __TOC__  History  The poultry pre-dated the roundabout, having lived at the site for decades before its construction. They are thought to have escaped from an allotment and survived on grain from a nearby maltings, which burned down in 1999. They were fed and cared for by Bungay resident Gordon Knowles for almost two decades, during which time they at one point numbered 300. In 2000, Norfolk County Council planned to move the birds over safety concerns but backtracked following protests. In 2002 the flock was threatened again when campaigners reported the chickens were being \\"systematically ‚Äì we think ‚Äì stolen and sold\\". 2006 saw an increase in numbers, to a total of over 100, thought to be the result of pet owners' fears over avian flu; and a decline, attributed to people feeding them rat poison, which led to their numbers being reduced to around six. In July 2009, some 70 chickens went missing from the flock of around 100. An RSPCA inspector commented that \\"Some may have been taken by foxes or other natural predators, but there is a possibility that others may have [been] stolen or harmed.\\" In 2010 the remaining six birds were given to an animal charity. Knowles said he would stop looking after the chickens as he could no longer bear to see them maltreated. In 2012, a plaque was unveiled celebrating Knowles's work, and a ceremony held at which Bungay town councillor Deirdre Shepherd described Knowles as \\"a living legend\\" and \\"one of the last of the great eccentrics\\". Also in 2012 a campaign was launched to commemorate the chickens with a series of statues; however in January 2013 Ditchingham Parish Council blocked plans for the \\"Chicken of the East\\" statue, which it described as a safety hazard. In February 2013, a group of five miniature hens were left on the roundabout, but were relocated days later. Gordon Knowles, known as the \\"Chicken Man of Bungay\\", died in January 2020.

It was written by staff writer Steve Kornacki and directed by Brad Anderson. Jimmy returns from Chicago to help Nucky deal with the D'Alessio brothers while Van Alden attempts to arrest Jimmy for the shootings in the woods. Plot A wounded Eli identifies the D'Alessio brothers as the culprits in the casino robbery. Margaret meets Nan, whom Nucky has brought home from Chicago. Nan explains how she and Senator Harding met and how, in order for him to win the upcoming presidential election, he cannot support her and their child. The two women go to Madame Jeunet's to buy a dress for Nan. Jeunet asks Margaret to persuade Nucky to reduce the exorbitant protection money he charges. At first, Margaret broaches the issue directly, but this only angers Nucky. Taking a different tack, she then tells Nucky she is worried about not looking good for him if Jeunet leaves. This works, and when Jeunet gratefully offers Margaret a dress for her daughter, Margaret instead uses her newly found influence to get a more expensive dress for herself. Nucky comes to work and is surprised to see Jimmy, who agrees to Nucky's offer on the condition that Nucky also employ Richard and keep their work a secret. Nucky shows Jimmy mugshots of the D'Alessio brothers, implying that he wants them dead; Jimmy notes that Nucky still avoids giving such orders directly. In New York, Rothstein plots to seize control of Atlantic City and its seaborne trade in high-quality alcohol. He meets the D'Alessios and hires them to kill Nucky. To hedge his \\"bet\\" on the hit, Rothstein has his new business partners sign life insurance policies with himself as the beneficiary. Angela drinks at home with Robert and Mary Dittrich. Robert tries to initiate a threesome with Angela and Mary, but the Dittrichs are forced to leave when Jimmy arrives unexpectedly. Angela says she never received his telegram. Jimmy forcefully kisses Angela and the two eventually have sex on the kitchen table. The next morning, Jimmy announces that with his new job, they can and should have a second child. Angela later visits the Dittrich studio, where Robert coolly informs her that his art dealer friend is no longer interested in her work, which he derides as \\"a cheap imitation of Mary Cassatt\\". Van Alden is furious at his partner, Agent Eric Sebso, for misplacing Jimmy's telegram to Nucky, which would have enabled them to arrest Jimmy as he arrived from Chicago. Van Alden plans to use Jimmy's guilt in the truck heist to coerce his testimony against Nucky. Jimmy visits Gillian, finding she has Luciano in bed. Before Jimmy can take Luciano away, Van Alden arrives to arrest Jimmy. He denies involvement in the heist, but in jail sees his old accomplice Billy Winslow, whom he thinks may have confessed. Nucky comes to Jimmy's cell and learns of Rothstein's alliance with the D'Alessios. He refuses to buy Jimmy a lawyer but promises to help in another way. Sebso convinces Van Alden to let him take away Winslow, who has indeed confessed. Along the way, Sebso is revealed to be corrupt, killing Winslow and wounding himself to fake an escape attempt. Nucky meets with the mayor and Deputy Halloran, Eli's second-in-command, who informs Nucky that Eli's recovery has been delayed for another month and asks to be appointed acting sheriff. When Nucky approves, Halloran further suggests that he should replace Eli permanently in the coming election, citing his poor health and growing public awareness of his corruption. The Commodore recommends that Eli and the mayor be dropped from the ballot, warning Nucky the election will be tough. Nucky and Margaret dine at Babette's with local businessman Edward L. Bader and his wife. Nucky asks Bader to run for mayor, explaining that he is dropping his support for the weak incumbent, Harry Bacharach. Out on the Boardwalk after dinner, Nucky and Margaret are ambushed by an assassin. Nucky's butler Eddie tackles the shooter, who hits an innocent woman instead. The assassin flees, although Eddie shoots him in the leg.

Their arrival is greeted with enthusiasm by young farm boy Tas, and weeks of exploration and good times follow before Aunt Jandie enters hospital, leaving the children in the care of Ma and Pa Pinner, her foreman and housekeeper. A few days of tyrannical treatment by the Pinners force the children to seek refuge in a secret cave, where they set up home to await the return of Jandie.

In 1961, Island Film Services, a Tasmania company formed by Charles E. Wolnizer, co-produced the film with Visatone Television. It was based on a popular children's novel by Nan Chauncy.Eastman, Berenice, 'Chauncy, Nancen Beryl (Nan) (1900‚Äì1970)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University accessed 1 September 2012. The lead actors were selected out of 500 children. The film was shot in south-east Tasmania in the summer and autumn of 1961 over seven months with interiors done at Elwick Showground in Hobart and some interiors done in Sydney. The railway footage was on the north coast of Tasmania and at New Town Station. Most of the cast and crew were Tasmanian. As the camera equipment was noisy during filming a lot of the dialogue was overdubbed in post-production. Director Andrew Steane was former head of the Tasmanian Department of Film Production.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900‚Äì1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998 p232 Larry Adler recorded harmonica for the music score while touring Australia.

It is a commonly used in Spectrophotometry for estimating the concentration of bacteria or other cells in a liquid as the 600nm wavelength does little to damage or hinder their growth. Optical density is largely based on light scattering and should not be confused with absorption.

A growth curve can then be constructed by taking absorbance measurements as a function of time. OD600 is preferable to UV spectroscopy when measuring the growth over time of a cell population because at this wavelength, the cells will not be killed as they would under too much UV light.

The Potter Instrument Company of Great Neck, New York developed a photoelectric tag reader for the 1952 pilot system. The reader scanned 100 tags per minute. A lens system enlarged the image of a tag's holes projected by a gas-type photoflash tube onto an array of phototubes.

It was first performed on a clarinet on 28 July 1977. History The first version of In Freundschaft was composed on Sunday, 24 July 1977 in Aix-en- Provence as a birthday gift for Suzanne Stephens. This version was written for the clarinet, but Stockhausen immediately made a fair-copy transposition for flute, and it was this version that was first performed, one time each by two American flautists, Lucille Goeres and Marjorie Shansky, for Stephens's birthday party in Aix on 28 July 1977. The first public performance, also of the flute version, was given by Lucille Goeres on 6 August 1977, in a concert by course participants of the Centre Sirius at the Aix Conservatory. Stockhausen reworked the composition on 27 April 1978, at which time he also made versions for oboe, trumpet, violin, and viola. The premiere of the version for clarinet was given by Suzanne Stephens on 30 November 1978 as part of a concert Hommage √† Olivier Messiaen, in the Salle Wagram, Paris, and the version for oboe was premiered by Heinz Holliger on 6 July 1979 in a Musik des 20. Jahrhunderts concert in the large hall of Funkhaus Halberg at the Saarl√§ndische Rundfunk in Saarbr√ºcken. At around this time, Stockhausen adapted the clarinet version for the basset horn, with extended range to low C, and this version was first performed by Suzanne Stephens at a private gathering at the composer‚Äôs house on the occasion of his fifty-first birthday on 22 August 1979. Both the clarinet and basset-horn versions are authorised for performance on bass clarinet, and the first public performance of the extended-range version was given by the Dutch bass clarinetist Harry Sparnaay on 10 January 1981 in Haarlem. In the following years, Stockhausen adapted the work for most of the other orchestral instruments. Between 7 and 10 January 1981, in collaboration with Warren Stewart, Stockhausen made a version for cello, which Stewart premiered at the Eastman School of Music on 23 April 1981. Even before this premiere, Stockhausen had adapted it, from 16 to 19 April 1981, as a new version for violin. A version for bassoon followed the next year, composed on 19 and 20 April 1982 for Kim Walker. During rehearsals, Stockhausen came to imagine the piece being played by a teddy bear, like the one he had had as a small child, only much larger. Walker had a costume made, and gave the premiere in the Wigmore Hall in London on 10 May 1982 under the title \\"In Freundschaft, for a teddy bear with bassoon\\". A version for trombone was requested by Mark Tezak, who finalized the details with Stockhausen during rehearsals in August and September 1982. Around the same time, John Sampen requested and performed a version for soprano saxophone, though Stockhausen made further adjustments the next year with the saxophonist Hugo Read. At the request of the hornist Alejandro Govea Zappino, a version for his instrument was prepared during rehearsals on 17 November 1983, but further changes were carried out up to 11 September 1984 and the premiere was only finally given by Jens McManama, hornist with the Ensemble InterContemporain, at a concert in Baden-Baden celebrating Pierre Boulez‚Äôs 60th birthday on 31 March 1985 . Even a version for alto recorder came into existence, at the instigation of Geesche Geddert, first in an exchange of letters, then in rehearsal with Stockhausen on 6 April 1984.. The published score of the cello version can also be played on double bass, and a version for tuba also exists. In response to a suggestion by his trumpet-player son, Markus (who had put off attempting the work for 20 years), he replaced the original trumpet version with a new one for trumpet in E with a special fourth valve. Markus gave the world premiere of this new version in K√ºrten on 31 August 1997. Analysis The four parameters of pitch, duration, dynamics, and timbre in In Freundschaft are all determined by the construction of a musical formula, the basic form of which is presented at the outset of the work. This basic form consists of five segments, containing 1, 3, 2, 5, and 8 notes‚Äîtherefore 19 notes in all‚Äîoccupying durational units of approximately 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 quarter- notes' duration, though the ending is altered in the introductory statement‚Äîa \\"reduced formula\\" ending with a slow oscillation between two notes a semitone apart.) This formula is then presented in two registrally separated and permuted alternating statements, similar to the arrangement in Stockhausen‚Äôs Mantra, so that the work may be said to be monothematic. Initially, the separation of the two layers is emphasized through the dynamics: the higher level is consistently ', the lower one '. Each layer consists of five segments, and the rests separating the segments in the upper layer correspond to the lengths of the sounding segments in the lower one. Measured in sixteenth-notes (and therefore on average a quarter the lengths of the upper- layer segments), these are: 4, 7, 2, 11, and 0 (= grace note). The segment statements are separated by a middle-register semitone trill (A to B in the clarinet version), which first emerges from a gradual acceleration of the last interval of the fifth segment in the introduction.) After the initial presentation, the opposing characters of the two layers are gradually evened out, in a process of development over seven cyclical statements of the formula, until the two layers are merged into a single melody. This is accomplished by progressively transposing the upper level downward by one semitone per cycle, and the lower level upward by the same degree. In this way, the entirely separate ranges in the first cycle (F5‚ÄìF6 and F4‚ÄìF5 are brought into the single octave C5‚ÄìB5 in the seventh. The overall form is interrupted by two cadenzas, the first between the third and fourth cycles, the second at the point of union between the two layers, beginning near the end of the sixth cycle and leading to the seventh.

It was originally founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts as the New England Glass Company in 1818, before relocating to Ohio in 1888 and renaming to Libbey Glass Co. After it was purchased in 1935, it operated as part of the Libbey-Owens-Ford company and as a division of the Owens-Illinois glass company until 1993, when it was separated back into an independent company. The company manufactures a number of glassware products, primarily tableware, drinkware and stemware. Historically, it was also involved in producing other types of glass products, such as automotive glass, glass drinking bottles, and light bulbs.  History  = New England Glass Company (1818‚Äì1892) = Exterior view of the New England Glass Company from the east, c. 1855 The New England Glass Company was originally founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts by Amos Binney, Edmund Munroe, Daniel Hastings, and Deming Jarves on February 16, 1818. The company produced both blown and pressed glass objects in a variety of colors, which had engraved, cut, etched, and gilded decorations. The firm was one of the first glass companies to use a steam engine to operate its cutting machines, and it built the only oven in the country that could manufacture red lead, a key ingredient in the making of flint glass. By the middle of the nineteenth century, the New England Glass Company was considered one of the leading glasshouses in the United States, best known for its cut and engraved glass. At its start, the company occupied a disused East Cambridge warehouse erected by the recently failed Boston Porcelain and Glass Company. It was fitted with two flint furnaces, 24 steam-operated glass-cutting mills, and a red-lead furnace, which in combination could produce many types of plain, molded, and cut glass.John Hayward. The New England gazetteer. O. Clapp, 1857. The company charter permitted it to manufacture \\"flint and crown glass of all kinds in the towns of Boston and Cambridge.\\" At that time, about 40 glass factories existed in the United States, though most had few employees. Deming Jarves held one key advantage over his competitors in the glass manufacturing business; he held the American monopoly on red lead (lithage), which was essential for the production of fine lead glass. In 1826, however, Jarves left to found the Boston and Sandwich Glass Company. Through the 1820s, the company exhibited at the American Institute Fair, won a Franklin Institute award for \\"skill and ingenuity,\\" and established agencies in New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. The company took full advantage of the introduction of pressed glass and its business grew rapidly. Within 25 years, the glass industry was Cambridge's top employer in 1845 and again in 1855, when two companies, New England and Bay State, each employed more than 500 people. Engraver Louis F. Vaupel (1824‚Äì1903), who joined New England Glass in 1856, led its creation in the 1860s and 1870s of high-quality cut and engraved products, including very fine paperweights.Laura Cotton. The fancy paperweights of the New England Glass Company. The Magazine Antiques, 1 Oct 2006. Vol.170, Iss.4 The company flourished as one of America's leading glass manufacturers through the Civil War, but the development of inexpensive soda-lime glass in West Virginia brought a deep decline in sales, which dropped from about $500,000 in 1865 to $232,304 in 1876, when the workforce had been reduced to only 200 laborers. In 1877, the company's directors withdrew from active participation, leasing the property to William Libbey, their agent since 1870. William L. Libbey took over the company in 1878 and renamed it the New England Glass Works, Wm. L. Libbey & Sons Props. In 1888, William's son, Edward Drummond Libbey, moved the company to Toledo, Ohio. = Libbey Glass Company (1892‚Äì1935) = Libbey Glass Works, Toledo, Ohio, 1912 The company's name was changed to The Libbey Glass Company in 1892, and it became part of Libbey-Owens-Ford for a number of years. During this time the company was involved in the production of automotive glass in its partnership with Ford Motor Company. The other part of the partnership ‚Äî between Edward Libbey and inventor Michael Joseph Owens of the Owens Bottle Machine Company ‚Äî proved valuable, as Owens developed the first automatic manufacturing methods for light bulbs, which, after adapted to manufacture Libbey's glass products, greatly increased the company's production output. Owens' contributions to the automation methods in the glass and bottling industries spread throughout the United States as the popularity of bottled drinks (and glass products as a whole) became more popular and cheaper to produce in the coming decades. = Libbey Glass Division, Owens- Illinois (1935‚Äì1993) = Libbey Glass Company was acquired by Owens-Illinois Glass Company in 1935, but in 1993 it was spun off as an independent company. = Libbey Inc. (1993‚Äìpresent) = In April 1993, Owens-Illinois announced that it would sell the Libbey Glass division for an estimated $225 million. The sale was viewed as a negative sign for the industry, as earlier that year the Libbey-Owens-Ford Co. had considered (but ultimately decided against) moving its headquarters to Monroe, Michigan, while Toledo was still struggling to maintain its status as a significant glass exporter. Libbey would be spun off as an independent company, and would make its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in June 1993. The company marked its 200th anniversary in 2018. In April that year, the Toledo Museum of Art featured a variety of glass artwork from its collection, all produced by Libbey over several decades. The company also hosted an invitation-only event in May that included performances from the Toledo Symphony Orchestra, as well as a public event at the museum. In March 2019, Libbey announced that it had hired Mike Bauer, the former president of Master Lock Company, to replace Bill Foley as Chief Executive Officer. Foley would retire, but remain as a board chairman. In June 2020, Libbey announced plans to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as the result of negative financial effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the announcement, Libbey had awarded a total of over $3 million in bonuses to its executive staff in an attempt to dissuade them from leaving the company, after having temporarily decreased their pay by 20-25%. This was done in addition to furloughing approximately 50% of its North American workforce and suspending 401(k) matching, among other cost-saving measures.

He was held as a hostage after being captured in 1264 during the Second Barons' War and records of some of his childhood expenses survive from his time as a hostage. He first entered royal service in 1286 and, in 1291, he succeeded his father as baron. He continued in royal military service, serving in Scotland as well as in Wales. Protracted disputes over his lands embroiled him throughout his life and at the end of his life helped spark a revolt against King Edward II of England's favourites, the Despensers. He married twice, and his heirs were his daughter Aline and his grandson John de Bohun. Family and early life Braose was the son of William de Braose, 1st Baron Braose and his first wife, Aline, daughter of Thomas de Multon. He was likely born around 1260, as his age was given as about 46 in 1307. Other events prove that he was born prior to 1264, as he was captured in that year. This came about during the Second Barons' War (1264‚Äì1267) during the reign of King Henry III of England, as the elder Braose had sided with the king during Simon de Montfort's rebellion. The younger Braose was a hostage in the custody of Montfort's wife, Eleanor. Her household accounts include expenses related to the younger William's care.Bartlett Hanged Man pp. 88‚Äì90 Sometime around 1285, Braose confirmed grants of land by his ancestors to the religious house of Sele Priory.Richardson Magna Carta Ancestry p. 137 In 1286 Braose was in the king's service, for unspecified duties overseas. It is possible that these included accompanying the king, Edward I, to Paris where Edward performed homage to the new French king, Philip IV, for Edward's French lands. Braose played a significant role in King Edward's Welsh wars. In the winter of 1287‚Äì8 he commanded the force blockading Emlyn castle. His men also provided the escort for the transport of a huge siege engine from Dryslwyn to Emlyn. The arrival of the engine, with 480 great stones as ammunition, persuaded the defenders of the castle to surrender peaceably.Morris Welsh Wars pp. 215‚Äì216 Marcher Baron The younger Braose succeeded his father before 1 March 1291, when he did homage for his father's lands. He received custody of his father's lands on 2 March 1291, which had been placed into the custody of Robert de Tibetot on 12 January 1291.Bartlett Hanged Man pp. 60‚Äì61 He was summoned a number of times to Parliament from 1291 until 1322 as Baron Braose. He was the second Baron Braose, as well as Lord of Gower and Lord of Bramber.Cokayne Complete Peerage Volume II pp. 302‚Äì304 After his father's death, Braose continued to serve Edward. He contributed both money and personal military service in Edward's wars in Wales, Scotland, and France. He saw service in Gascony in 1294. In 1297 he took part in a military campaign in Flanders. As a reward for his service in Flanders, he received the wardship of John de Mowbray, who Braose eventually married to his daughter Aline. From 1298 to 1306 he was involved in the Scottish wars, and was at the Battle of Falkirk on 22 July 1298. Besides the military service, he served the king in 1301 by signing a letter from the leading barons of England to Pope Boniface VIII in which the barons decried papal interference in the royal rights of England. Braose captured the Welsh rebel William Cragh in 1290, whose miraculous resurrection after being hanged was attributed to Thomas de Cantilupe.Hanska \\"Hanging of William Cragh\\" Journal of Medieval History This led in 1307 to Braose giving testimony to papal commissioners inquiring into the events surrounding Cragh's hanging and whether or not it would support the canonisation of Cantilupe.Bartlett Hanged Man pp. 1‚Äì11 It was most likely Braose who commissioned a condensed copy of Domesday Book, now Public Record Office manuscript E164/1. This copy has a marginal notation of \\"Br\\" next to the estates owned by Braose's ancestor, the first William de Braose.Bartlett Hanged Man pp. 86, 152 Braose was embroiled in a dispute over his lordship of Gower in 1299 when the Bishop of Llandaff, John de Monmouth, brought a case against Braose to the king. Although the case was adjudicated in 1302, the resulting decision was overturned. In 1304 Braose secured King Edward's confirmation of earlier grants and charters granting Braose special rights and liberties in Gower. He managed this because he was serving the king in Scotland at the time, and thus had easy access to the king. In 1305, however, Braose miscalculated and insulted a royal judge, using \\"gross and contumelious words\\" to describe the royal official.Quoted in Phillips Edward II p. 105 footnote 105 This episode caused the case of Gower to be reopened in 1306, and Braose was only able to settle the issue again by the grant of rights to his men in Swansea and Gower.Prestwich Edward I pp. 538‚Äì539 In 1320 King Edward II of England confiscated the lordship of Gower on the grounds that Braose had given it to his son-in-law Mowbray without royal permission. Over the preceding years Braose had promised Gower to a number of persons, including Humphrey de Bohun, the Earl of Hereford, Hugh Despenser the Younger, and Roger Mortimer of Wigmore. Mowbray then in late 1319 took custody of Gower to protect his rights. Despenser persuaded the king in 1320 to take Gower into royal hands in October, and was appointed keeper of the honour in November. The other lords in the Welsh Marches resented this seizure, feeling that the king's excuse for it was not applicable. The seizure was one of the precipitating causes of the baronial rebellion that led to the exile of the Despensers in 1321.Prestwich Plantagenet England pp. 197‚Äì198 In 1322 Gower was given to the younger Despenser again, who then traded it for the honours of Usk and Caerleon. Braose was then induced to sue the new holder of Gower for the return of the barony in April 1324, which action succeeded in June 1324. Braose then promptly gave Gower to the elder Despenser, returning the property to the Despenser family once more.Phillips Edward II p. 446 The lordship of Gower eventually ended up in the hands of the Beauchamp family, but it was not until the 1350s that the issue was decided.Prestwich Plantagenet England p. 426 Marriage, death, and legacy The name of Braose's first wife was Agnes,Cokayne Complete Peerage Volume XIV p. 111 but her family is not known. His second wife was Elizabeth, the daughter and heiress of Raymund de Sully. He had two daughters with his first wife, but no children with his second wife, who outlived him. It appears that there was a son named William, who was the subject of a military summons from King Edward in 1311, but nothing further is mentioned of him after 1315. In 1316 a settlement of William the father's estates made no mention of this son making it likely that the son died before this date.Bartlett Hanged Man pp. 138‚Äì141 Braose died not long before 1 May 1326 and his heirs were his daughter Aline and his grandson John de Bohun.Public Record Office Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem Vol. 6 p. 435 Aline, the elder daughter,Phillips Edward II p. 366 married John de Mowbray and Richard de Peschale. The second daughter, Joan, married James de Bohun and Richard Foliot, son of Jordan Foliot. Mowbray received the lands of Gower and Bramber before Braose's death. Braose was known as a man often in debt and as being unable to manage his cash flow well. Thomas Walsingham stated in his chronicle that Braose was \\"very rich by descent but a dissipater of the property left to him\\".Quoted in Bartlett Hanged Man p. 139 Notes Citations References    * * External links * National Archives Catalogue entry for the Domesday Breviate ‚Äì probably commissioned by William de Braose Category:Anglo-Normans Category:Anglo- Normans in Wales Category:Barons in the Peerage of England Category:1326 deaths Category:Norman warriors Category:Year of birth unknown Category:13th- century Welsh people Category:14th-century Welsh people ","title":"William de Braose, 2nd Baron Braose"},{"id":"29631006","text":"The 1988 South Carolina Gamecocks football team represented the University of South Carolina as an independent team in the 1988 NCAA Division I-A football season.

At a certain altitude (roughly ) even the lowest frequency tone that can be heard by a human being (around 20 Hz) no longer can be transmitted.

PM was developed as a reaction against ahistorical models of Marxist analysis in the debate on the origins of capitalism. The PM critique brought social agency and class conflict to the center of Marxism. In this context, Robert Brenner and Ellen Wood founded PM as a distinct approach to rehistoricise and repoliticise the Marxist project. It was a movement away from structuralist and timeless accounts towards historical specificity as contested process and lived praxis. This research programme has since expanded across the social sciences to include the fields of history, political theory, political economy, sociology, international relations and international political economy.Political Marxism and the Social Sciences The term Political Marxism itself was coined during the Brenner Debate of the late 1970s as a criticism of the work of Brenner by the French Marxist historian Guy Bois. Bois distinguished Brenner's 'political Marxism' from 'economic Marxism'.'Against the Neo-Malthusian Orthodoxy', in The Brenner Debate: Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe, ed. by Trevor Aston and C.H.E. Philpin, Past and Present Publications (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), pp. 107‚Äì18 (pp. 115‚Äì16) [repr. from Past & Present, 79 (1978), pp. 60-69]. 'Brenner's Marxism is \\"political Marxism\\"‚Äîin reaction to the wave of economistic tendencies in contemporary historiography. As the role of the class struggle is widely underestimated, so he injects strong doses of it into his own historical interpretation. I do not question the motivation behind such a reaction, but rather the summary and purely ideological manner in which it is implemented. It amounts to a voluntarist vision of history in which the class struggle is divorced from all other objective contingencies and, in the first place, from such laws of development as may be peculiar to a specific mode of production. As such, the label 'Political Marxism' has not always been accepted by the scholars to whom it has been applied.

It is used in population genomics and phylogenetic studies to compare its wild characteristics to laboratory yeasts. Ecology Saccharomyces paradoxus is mostly isolated from deciduous trees (oak, maple, birch), and in some rare occasions on insects and fruits. It is often found in sympatry with other Saccharomyces species. Like Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it has a worldwide distribution and it is mesophilic, which limits its natural distribution to low latitudes. However, Saccharomyces paradoxus typically grows at lower temperatures than Saccharomyces cerevisiae, resulting in a slight shift in its distribution toward cooler regions, like British islands and Eastern Canada. Biogeography Saccharomyces paradoxus worldwide distribution. Populations are represented in different colours. Green asterisks indicate recent introductions of the European type. Phylogeny of main Saccharomyces paradoxus populations. Unlike most other Saccharomyces species, there is no evidence that Saccharomyces paradoxus has been domesticated by humans. Accordingly, its biogeography is mostly marked by natural processes like limited migration, glacial refugia and adaptation to climate. At least four genetically and phenotypically distinct populations of Saccharomyces paradoxus have been identified, corresponding to main geographical divisions: Europe (including West Siberia), Far East Asia (Japan, Eastern Siberia), North America (North American East and West coasts, Great Lakes region) and North-East America (Gasp√© Peninsula, Saint Lawrence Valley and Appalaches), respectively. Representative strains of these populations exhibit partial post-zygotic isolation. A fifth population is represented by a singleton isolate from Hawaii. Some strains from the European population are found in North America and New Zealand and likely result from recent colonization events. Two isolates from South America, described as Saccharomyces cariocanus, are genetically indistinguishable but exhibit post- zygotic isolation when crossed to strains from the American population, due to chromosomal translocations. Reproduction Saccharomyces paradoxus is naturally homothallic, and is mostly found as diploid in the environment. Reproduction is mostly clonal and 99% of sexual reproduction occurs between spores from the same ascus. This purges recessive deleterious mutations that accumulated during clonal expansion, in a process known as \\"genome renewal\\". Post-zygotic isolation between strains of Saccharomyces paradoxus is commonly observed and could be either due to genetic divergence between populations or to chromosomal changes within populations. Like in other Saccharomyces species, heterothallism can be restored using standard genetic tools, to obtain stable haploid strains for experimental purposes.

Present-day Noli is in Liguria, in the Province of Savona. To protect itself from possible attacks and invasions by Savona and Marquisate of Finale, Noli allied in 1202 with the Republic of Genoa in a sort of protectorate, in fact, documents of the time show that the relationship was equal and not one of submission. Thanks to this alliance, the Republic's importance grew to such an extent that in 1239 a diocese was established there by Pope Gregory IX. History Noli was founded in 1192. It survived for 605 years, before being annexed by Napoleon in 1797. Economy Despite its small size, Noli's good shipyard and harbor allowed them to become a commercial power. They had good trade relations with Genoa, as they only had to pay one penny to be allowed to trade in Genoa, whereas the Spanish had to pay 60 pennies to be allowed to trade. Military Noli's efficient shipyard allowed them to become somewhat of a naval power, despite their small size. Their alliance with Genoa afforded them much protection, especially as Genoa used Noli's port to shelter their ships. It is known that during a conflict with Savona, Noli sacked the town of Spotorno, which was owned by them, in 1227. Foreign relations In 1202 Noli was threatened by Savona. In response to this Noli formed a confederation with the powerful Maritime Republic of Genoa. Noli kept this alliance until they were dissolved in 1797. Flag The flag of Noli was first created in the 13th century, with a white cross and a red background, the exact opposite of Genoa's flag. Many of the merchant ships of Noli chose to fly under the Genoese flag, as it commanded much more respect. Religion In 1239 the Pope appointed a bishop to Noli.

This site had one of the first industrial zones of the continent; they manufactured copper and ceramics items, also found many archaeological materials of various kinds, such as: shell beads from shaft tombs, also earflaps with Teotihuacan motifs and polychrome ceramic Codex style. The objects found, were as a result of continuous occupation this site had, for at least one 1, 800 years, in contrast with other large cities like Teotihuacan and Monte Alban. History Cultural groups near Zacatecas In the 16th century this area was called \\"north of the central Mexico plateau\\" that was never conquered by the Aztecs, \\"La Gran Chichimeca\\". It now comprises the States of Jalisco, Aguascalientes, Nayarit, Guanajuato, San Luis Potos√≠ Durango, Coahuila and Zacatecas. The Aztec and Spaniards called the residents of this great area, Chichimecas, although they were of different cultures, languages, or civilizations. It reported that four primary nations lived in what is now Zacatecas: the Caxcan , Guachichil, Tepehu√°n and Zacatecos. The state was named after the Zacatecos, it was the nickname given by the Aztecs to the Bufa hill inhabitants. Is a composed nahuatl word that means \\"inhabitants of the land where grass abounds\\", it derives from the zacatl, ‚ÄúReed‚Äù or grass, and locative co. The majority of its inhabitants were hunting nomads, but also settled in several places. Some parts of the territory, particularly the south was under Mesoamerican influence, while the rest of the territory formed part of what is now called Aridoam√©rica. Zacatecas has other important archaeological sites like La Quemada, located in the Villanueva municipality and Altavista in the Chalchihuites municipality. These areas have ceremonial buildings and pyramids with architectural features of the Mesoamerican cultures. =Chichimecs= Chichimeca was the name that the Nahua peoples of Mexico generically applied to a large number of bands and tribes of nomadic and semi-nomadic peoples who inhabited the north of modern-day Mexico and southwestern United States, and carried the same sense as the European term \\"barbarian\\". The name was adopted with a pejorative tone by the Spaniards when referring especially to the hunter-gatherer peoples of northern Mexico. In modern times only one ethnic group is customarily referred to as Chichimecs, namely the Chichimeca Jonaz, although lately this usage is being changed for simply \\"Jon√°z\\" or their own name for themselves \\"√öza\\". Many of the peoples called Chichimeca are virtually unknown today; few descriptions mention them and they seem to have been absorbed into mestizo culture or into other indigenous ethnic groups. For example, virtually nothing is known about the peoples referred to as Guachichiles, Caxcanes, Zacatecos, Tecuexes, or Guamares. Others like the Opata or \\"Eudeve\\" are well described but extinct as a people. =Caxcanes= The Caxcan caxcanes o cazcanes were a partly nomadic people that spoke Uto- Aztecan languages. The Caxcan were allied with the Zacatecos against the Spaniards during the Mixt√≥n Rebellion During the rebellion, they were described as \\"the heart and the center of the Indian Rebellion\\". They were famously led by Tenamaxtli. After the rebellion, they were at constant target by the Zacatecos and Guachichiles due to their ceasefire agreement with the Spaniards. Their principal religious and population centers were at Teul, Tlaltenango, Juchipila, and Teocaltiche. Represented the largest group and lived around El Te√∫l, Tlaltenango, Juchipila, Teocaltiche, Nochistl√°n, Aguascalientes, and Jalisco. Within the group, a subgroup called \\"tezoles\\" believed they descended from the 7 Aztl√°n tribes, searching for the land promised by Huitzilopochtli; this is known from the miscellaneous Chronicle of Father Antonio Tello, who noted that the caxcans have some similarity in language of the Aztecs; refers to \\"caxcans peoples are people who speaks almost the Aztec language and claimed to be Aztec descendants, but do not speak the language as cultured and refined as the Aztec\\". It is also believed that as a consequence of the Chalchihuites collapse, there was a migration to the south, and would eventually become the caxcanes. The word caxcan means \\"there is no\\", and the name remained because \\"when the spaniards arrived and asked for food or other things, the people responded in their native language, \\"I do not have or there is no...\\". The caxcans were conquerors, through their history, conquered and founded towns as Amecatl, Tuitl√°n, Juchipila, El Te√∫l, Nochistl√°n and Teocaltiche, \\"a center of Tecuexe warriors who were allied with caxcan neighbors, the Zacatecas and guachichiles\\". The caxcans had a political and social system structured, had a larger village as capital, and several smaller dependent neighborhoods. Unlike other Chichimeca groups, the caxcans became sedentary due to their relations with Otom√≠ and Pur√©pecha peoples. Regional Trade Nayarit ceramics evidence has been found, in the coastal Nayarit region have found copper artifacts. Absence thus far of copper oxide minerals as well as Nayarit ceramic on this site, infer of trade relations, and the possibility that foundries here manufactured ornaments for Nayarit. This opens an interesting debate on the old economies and regional trade. It is known that the El Te√∫l inhabitants had links with the Atemajac Valley, the tequila Valley and the Sayula basin. Also with La Quemada and Chalchihuites (Zacatecas) in addition to relations with Bola√±os and the aztatl√°n network, a culture located in Nayarit and Sinaloa. Occupation Periods It is believed that the site is one of the few places on the continent with an uninterrupted occupation from 200 BCE to 1531 CE. The occupation chronology is comparable with cities such as Cholula. It is possible that the site was a Caxcanes ceremonial center, one of the most warrior groups against the Spanish invaders and those who were about to defeat them in the famous Mixt√≥n war. El Te√∫l caxcan occupation is estimated at two centuries (1350 / 1400 to 1531 CE). The destruction of the ceremonial area, this particular stage, occurred when the caxcans reused it a place of worship. In Zacatecas, El Te√∫l was occupied at least six centuries before other ceremonial centers, such as La Quemada and Altavista, and was contemporary during the mid-classical and epiclassical periods, from 400 to 1000 CE, to be then occupied again 500 years after the abandonment. Fire evidence has been found during the epiclassical period (600-900 CE.) such as ‚Äúbox tombs‚Äù. These are dated between 200 and 500 CE, evidence of changes in funerary patterns from shaft tombs to box tombs. This is important because represents the time when western cultures begin to integrate to the Baj√≠o and the Valley of Mexico. So far it is not known who the caxcanes were and what their pottery was like. In relation to the occupation of this site, it is not known who built it originally and who lived here before the caxcans. El Te√∫l was inhabited during 1,800 years, three times more than sites such as La Quemada, and Alta Vista, also in Zacatecas, they only had six centuries of occupation. The Site Archeological remains at the site The site has a total area of 150 hectares; there is only exploration in an area of five to six hectares. The site is not yet open to the public. Two pyramids and a portion of a ball game court have only been uncovered, several human burials were found, that reveal changes in funerary patterns of their former inhabitants. Objects found reflect the life of the ancient inhabitants of the site, such as a fetus representation found in the pyramid at the altar.The Niuki 9th. Edition has other texts linked to El Te√∫l such as: \\"The people of El Te√∫l, at its roots\\", from Luis Sandoval; \\"Mezcalera Tradition in El Te√∫l\\" and \\"revolutionary teulenses: the Caloca\\", Ezequiel Avila, and \\"Life of five El Te√∫l characters.\\" \\"Hope for current times\\", Hugo √Åvila. Also found shell beads and green stone were found from shaft tombs, in addition to earflaps with Teotihuacan‚Äôs motifs and polychrome ceramic style Codex, among others. Structures Investigation and exploration work is ongoing, thus far several structures have been found: =Circular Altar= A circular altar was found, measuring over six meters in diameter. =Eastern Complex= This complex has the following reported structures: *Ballgame court, only half of the court has been explored, has two construction stages. The first corresponds to the epiclassical, while the late stage reveals a new construction with a very fine masonry which makes it a closed court; it dates from the early postclassical (900 to 1100 CE). * Two mound plaza (No information available) * Sunken patio. Several human burials were found, of the ‚ÄúBox Tomb Tradition‚Äù. Sculpture A prehispanic sculpture was found, representing a life-size decapitated ballgame player. It is a stone sculpture dated between 900-1100 CE, there is evidence that it was intentionally manufactured without head, probably for the ball game rituals. It is a cylindrical sculpture measuring 1.97 meters high, 52 centimeters in diameter, with an approximate weight of one ton, found on the south side, east of the ballgame court. Also found fragments of another such sculpture at the other side, it is possible that there are other similar sculptures. Furnace An almost intact copper smelting furnace was found, one of the metallurgy problems is how to fire furnaces; evidence found indicate that corn cobs were apparently used, used as fuel and wick. The prehispanic furnace built over 800 years ago, was used for copper smelter. Finding this furnace is of great importance, is the oldest in prehispanic Mexico and was used during the early postclassical, i.e. between 900 and 1200 CE. The furnace was built with Stone and masonry, has ashes and corn traces and burnt corn, that was used as fuel, these organic materials will allow a more precise dating. In some Michoac√°n Pur√©pecha sites, have found structures resembling furnaces but very damaged, this is the first one complete, allowing analyzing aspects of technologies used, which was not known in Mexico. Tombs Seven graves of the so-called \\"shaft tomb‚Äù were found, characteristic of western cultures, and correspond to the late preclassical (200 BCE to 200 CE) period. These are deep burials. At the sunken patio, several human burials were found, depicting the box burial tradition. These burials are characterized by the flexed position of the human remains and placed in masonry ‚Äúboxes‚Äù, with their respective offerings. These burials are dated from 200 to 500 CE, and reflect funeral changes of the ancient inhabitants, from shaft tomb patterns to box burials.

The runestone has an inscription which refers to a Viking Age mercantile guild and depicts a ship. Description Runestone √ñg M√ñLM1960;230 was rediscovered in the base of a church tower in 1960. Before the historic significance of runestones was understood, they were often reused as building materials for roads, churches, and other buildings. After being repaired, it was raised outside of the church. The runic inscription on this granite stone, which is 2.4 meters in height, consists of text in the younger futhark within an arching text band that is under a depiction of a ship. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style RAK, which is the classification used for text bands that have straight ends and do not have any attached serpent or beast heads. The church at Tornevalla showing the runestone in front of the church tower. Ship images appear on several Viking Age runic inscriptions. Other runic inscriptions from the Viking Age which depict ships include DR 77 in Hjermind, DR 119 in Spentrup, DR 220 in S√∏nder Kirkeby, DR 258 in B√∂sarp, DR 271 in Tullstorp, DR 328 in Holmby, DR EM85;523 in Fars√∏, √ñg 181 in Ledberg, √ñg 224 in Stratomta, S√∂ 122 in Skresta, S√∂ 154 in Skarp√•ker, S√∂ 158 in √ñsterberga, S√∂ 164 in Sp√•nga, S√∂ 351 in √ñverj√§rna, S√∂ 352 in Linga, Vg 51 in Husaby, U 370 in Herresta, U 979 in Gamla Uppsala, U 1052 in Axlunda, U 1161 in Altuna, and Vs 17 in R√•by. Three stones, the H√∏rdum and L√•ngtora kyrka stones and U 1001 in Rasbo, depict ships but currently do not have any runes on them and may never have had any. The runic text, which is damaged at the beginning, indicates that the stone is a memorial to a man named Drengr who was the son of a man possibly named Eygeirr, and that the person or persons who sponsored the stone and Drengr were members of a guild. This is one of four runestones that mention guilds in Viking Age Sweden, the others being U 379 in Kyrkog√•rden, U 391 in Pr√§stgatan, and √ñg 64 in Bj√§lbo. p. 179. These stones and others discussing f√©lags are evidence of the trading activities during this period of Scandinavian history. One scholar has suggested that the image of the ship may have been a type of heraldic badge or symbol of the guild that raised the stone. The name Drengr is a bit unusual as it normally is a title associated with warriors or merchants. However, there are several examples from Scandinavia in which an Old Norse word that is a designation of status has become a personal name. In the inscription, each word in the runic text is separated with a punctuation mark consisting of two dots except for the name Drengr, which has been emphasized by using a different word divider consisting of a single dot. p. 469.

Some such bottles have less than half the plastic of a regular water bottle. The low plastic water bottle has seen an increase in production over the last few years. This is mainly because making low plastic bottles is more efficient, cost-effective, and more environmentally friendly than producing regular bottles. A large number of water companies now exclusively use a low plastic design for their 16.9 oz bottles, including Aquafina.Environmental Leader: Aquafina Eco-Fina Bottle Claims Lightest Weight in its Class Recycling Companies have also taken recycling into consideration. Previously when water bottles were bought in packs of 24, there was a plastic wrap around the bottles and there was a cardboard base. This packaging was not recyclable, but now some water companies have made the packaging fully recyclable, and also have eliminated the cardboard base. Eliminating the cardboard base saves 20 million pounds of corrugated material annually. The plastic reduction in the bottles themselves saves 75 million pounds of plastic. Thinner plastic bottles are harder to recycle. The average yield of PET bottle recycling in Europe dropped from 73% to 63% between 2011 and 2017, with low-plastic bottles being blamed for a higher moisture content in recycling bales, and for producing thinner plastic flakes which are more likely to be discarded during the recycling process. Replacements for plastics At least one other commercial attempt has been made toward the creation of cheap, non-plastic containers for water. In 2009, Ecologic Brands, Inc. released a water bottle which was created using a combination of recyclable, sustainable sheet stock such as bamboo or palm leaves. The design was entered into INNOVIC's Next Big Thing Award for 2009.Next Big Thing Award home page The company has since gone on to create a paper jug which can be used as a holder for a recyclable plastic bag for liquids such as milk and detergent.

D-Glyceric Aciduria) is an inherited disease, in the category of inborn errors of metabolism. It is caused by a mutation in the gene GLYCTK, which encodes for the enzyme glycerate kinase. Pathophysiology Glycerate kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of D-glyceric acid (a.k.a. D-glycerate) to 2-phosphoglycerate. This conversion is an intermediary reaction found in several metabolic pathways, including the degradation (break-down; catabolism) of serine, as well as the breakdown of fructose.

He is mainly known in the music scene as the former bassist for avant- garde/progressive metal band Kekal. He also has his own grindcore project called Mournphagy. His professional occupation is a mechanical engineer where he makes a living from, and he is also known lately as an avid coffee enthusiast and runs his own coffee roastery and brewing shop in Jakarta called Orkid√© Coffee. Kekal Azhar Levi joined Kekal on 1996, the same year that the band released their official demo, Contra Spiritualia Nequitiae. Throughout the first 5 years, the band developed their style by incorporating many diverse elements from outside metal. This distinct style became most prominent in their third album The Painful Experience, which marked as a starting point for the band to step more and more into progressive and avant- garde metal and make further experiments with their music. In the year 2003, Kekal released 1000 Thoughts of Violence and received positive media reviews which led to their first international tour in 2004. Shortly after this success, Kekal was back in the studio to record their official reunion album, Acidity, which was released in 2005. In March 2009, Azhar Levi decided to step down from Kekal. Front man Jeff Arwadi said that although this closed a door, Kekal would continue as a musical unit. However, later that year, Jeff himself stepped down, along with remaining member Leo Setiawan, but it was decided that Kekal as an institution would remain in existence. Despite the fact that the band is now member-less, Kekal has continued to function as a musical unit, with all 3 former members including Azhar Levi contributing to the band's eighth studio album, entitled 8 in 2010, and ninth studio album Autonomy in 2012. Azhar Levi did not write or play any music in those albums, but he made hand-drawn illustrations and photography for both albums' covers.

Although never actually observed, and unlikely to exist anywhere within the Milky Way, they have been hypothesized to exist, and their existence, on the presumption that hypothesis is correct, has been put forward as one possible explanation for various observed natural phenomena over the years.  Hypothesized existence  The hypothesis of comets made of antimatter can be traced back to the 1940s, when physicist Vladimir Rojansky proposed, in his paper The Hypothesis of the Existence of Contraterrene Matter the possibility that some comets and meteoroids could be made from \\"contraterrene\\" matter (i.e. antimatter). Such objects, Rojanski stated, would (if they existed at all) have their origins outside the Solar System. He hypothesized that if there were an antimatter object in orbit in the Solar System, it would exhibit the behavior of comets observed in the 1940s: As its atoms annihilated with \\"terrene\\" matter from other bodies and solar wind, it would generate volatile compounds and undergo a change of composition to elements with lower atomic masses. From this basis he propounded the hypothesis that some objects that had been identified as comets may, in fact, be antimatter objects, suggesting, based upon calculations using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, that it would be possible to determine the existence of such objects within the Solar System by observing their temperatures. An antimatter body subjected to normal levels of meteoric bombardment (per 1940s figures), and absorbing half of the energy created by the annihilation of normal matter and antimatter, would have a temperature of for bombardment figures calculated by Wylie or for calculations by Nininger. In the 1970s, when comet Kohoutek was observed, Rojanski again suggested hypothesis of antimatter comets in a letter in Physical Review Letters, and suggested that gamma-ray observations be made of the comet to test this hypothesis. Rojansky's original 1940 hypothesis was that perhaps the only bodies within the Solar System that could be antimatter were comets and meteoroids, all others being almost certainly normal matter. Experimental evidence gathered since then has not only borne out this restriction but has made the existence of actual antimatter comets and meteoroids themselves seem ever more unlikely. Gary Steigman, assistant professor of Astronomy at Yale University, observed in 1976 that space probes had proven ‚Äî by the fact that they were not annihilated upon impact ‚Äî that bodies such as Mars, Venus, and the Moon were not antimatter. He also noted that had any of the planets or similar bodies been antimatter, their interaction with the terrene solar wind and the sheer strength of the gamma ray emissions that would have resulted would have made them readily noticeable long since. He noted that not even antimatter cosmic rays had been found, with all of the nuclei found in studies having been uniformly terrene, the experimental data in several studies made from 1961 onwards by various people excluding the presence of a fractional antimatter composition of cosmic rays any larger than 10‚àí4 of the total. Further, the uniformly terrene nature of the cosmic ray flux indicates that nowhere in the Milky Way are there any sources of heavier antimatter elements (such as carbon), since (although it is not proven) it is a likely assumption that they represent the overall composition of the entire galaxy. They are representative of the galaxy as a whole ‚Äî goes the logic ‚Äî and since they do contain terrene carbon and other atoms, but have not been observed to contain any antimatter atoms, therefore there is no reasonable source for extrasolar antimatter comets, meteoroids, or any other large scale heavy element objects to originate from, within this galaxy. Martin Beech from the University of Western Ontario (London, Ontario, Canada) referred to the various hypotheses and experimental results that support non-existence of antimatter in the Universe. He argued that any antimatter comets and meteors that exist must be (at least) extrasolar in origin because the nebular hypothesis for the formation of the Solar System precludes their being solar. Any antimatter in a pre-formation nebula or planetary accretion disc has a comparatively short lifetime, astronomically speaking, before annihilation with the terrene matter that it is mixed with. This lifetime is measured in the hundreds of years, and so any solar antimatter present at the time that the system was formed will have long since been annihilated. Any antimatter comets and meteors must therefore come from another solar system. Furthermore, not only must antimatter meteors be extrasolar in origin, they must have been recently (i.e. within the past 104 ~ 105 years) captured by the Solar System. Most meteoroids are broken down to sizes of 10‚àí5 g within that timeframe, because of meteoroid-upon-meteoroid collisions. Thus any antimatter meteor must be either extrasolar in origin itself, or broken off from an antimatter comet that is extrasolar in origin. The former are unlikely to exist from observational evidence. Any extrasolar meteoroid would have a hyperbolic orbit, but less than 1% of the observed meteoroids have such, and the process of perturbation of ordinary (terrene) solar objects, by planetary encounters, into hyperbolic trajectories accounts for all of those. Beech concluded that a continued null result, however, does not constitute a proof ('Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence', M. Rees) and a single positive detection negates the arguments presented.  Hypothesized explanations for observed phenomena  = Tektites = In 1947, Mohammad Abdur Rahman Khan, professor at Osmania University and research associate at the Institute of Meteoretics in the University of New Mexico, put forward the hypothesis that antimatter comets or meteoroids were responsible for tektites . However, this explanation, out of the many proposed explanations for tektites, is considered to be one of the more improbable. = Tunguska event of 1908 = By the 1950s, speculating about antimatter comets and meteoroids was a commonplace exercise for astrophysicists. One such, Philip J. Wyatt of Florida State University, suggested that the Tunguska event may have been a meteor made of antimatter . Willard Libby and Clyde Cowan took Wyatt's idea further , having studied worldwide levels of carbon-14 in tree rings and noticing unusually high levels for the year 1909. However, even in 1958 the theoretical flaws in the hypothesis were observed, aside from the evidence that was coming in at the same time from the first gamma ray measurement satellites. For one, the hypothesis did not explain how an antimatter meteor could have managed to survive that low into the Earth's atmosphere, without being annihilated as soon as it encountered terrene matter at the upper levels. = Ball lightning = In 1971, fragments of antimatter comets or meteoroids were hypothesized, by David E. T. F. Ashby of Culham Laboratory and Colin Whitehead of the U.K. Atomic Energy Research Establishment, as a possible cause for ball lightning . They monitored the sky with gamma-ray detection apparatus, and reported unusually high numbers at 511 keV (kilo-electron volts) which is the characteristic gamma ray frequency of a collision between an electron and a positron. There were natural explanations for such readings. In particular positrons can be produced indirectly by the action of a thunderstorm, as it creates the unstable isotopes nitrogen-13 and oxygen-15. However, Ashby and Whitehead noted that there were no thunderstorms present at the times that the gamma-ray readings were observed. They instead presented the hypothesis of antimatter meteors as an interesting one that did explain all of what their observations had recorded, and suggested that it merited further investigation. = Gamma-ray bursts = Antimatter comets thought to exist in the Oort cloud were in the 1990s hypothesized as one possible explanation for gamma ray bursts. These bursts can be explained by the annihilation of matter and antimatter microcomets. The explosion would create powerful gamma ray bursts and accelerate matter to near light speeds. These antimatter microcomets are thought to reside at distances of more than 1000 AU. Calculations have shown that comets of around 1 km in radius would shrink by 1 m if they passed the Sun with a perihelion of 1 AU. Microcomets, due to the stresses of solar heating, shatter and burn up much more quickly because the forces are more concentrated within their small masses. Antimatter microcomets would burn up even more rapidly because the annihilation of solar wind with the surface of the microcomet would produce additional heat. As more gamma-ray bursts were detected in subsequent years, this theory failed to explain the observed distribution of gamma-ray bursts about host galaxies and detections of X-ray lines associated with gamma-ray bursts. The discovery of a supernova associated with a gamma-ray burst in 2002 provided compelling evidence that massive stars are the origin of gamma-ray bursts. Since 2002, more supernovae have been observed to be associated with gamma-ray bursts, and massive stars as the origin of gamma-ray bursts has been firmly established.

Note that flaith is given the translation \\"Prince.\\" A flaith (Irish) or flath (Modern Scottish Gaelic), plural flatha, in the Gaelic world, could refer to any member in general of a powerful family enjoying a high degree of sovereignty, and so is also sometimes translated as lord or aristocrat in the general sense, or can refer to sovereignty itself. Thus it did not usually refer to a specific position such as R√≠ (king) which any given flaith might or might not hold, allowing for the term to eventually develop the slightly alternative meaning of any hereditary high aristocrat who was understood to be subordinate to the king. In this later sense a flaith was similar to a magnate or Grandee. The later development in meaning, innocent in itself, unfortunately allowed the term flaith to become confused with \\"chief\\" as that term is commonly understood in English, when in fact a Gaelic \\"chief\\" was very often technically a r√≠ (king) of any one of three or more grades and holding a White Wand. A flaith might not hold a White Wand; he might simply be a brother, nephew or some relation of the king. The flaith might be the head of a junior sept of the royal kindred or a member of another great family which was somehow in the king's service. It became an element in personal and eventually family names, an example being the royal family of O'Flaherty or Ua Flaithbertaig (\\"Descendants of the Bright Prince\\"). It could be combined with r√≠ to form the personal name Flaithr√≠ (\\"Princely King\\" or \\"Kingly Prince\\"), an example being Flaithr√≠ mac Domnaill, King of Connacht. A Banfhlaith (lit. \\"Lady Prince\\") was a princess more specifically described. However, illustrative of how flaith was principally a general term for a member of the high nobility, the personal names Gormflaith (\\"Blue Princess\\" or \\"Blue Sovereignty\\") and √ìrflaith (\\"Golden Princess\\") were understood to be female without the addition of the feminine affix.

Stach Konwa probably existed, but there are no historical sources to back this up. The name ‚ÄúKonwa‚Äù is not a name usually found in the Kurpie region, and it may be that it could be a pseudonym used to protect his family and friends from reprisal. On the other hand, researchers, such as Wies≈Çaw Majewski, suggest that he was created by writers attempting to stimulate public consciousness. Stach Konwa was the epitome of the myth of free and courageous Kurpie leaders, derived from the people, who fought against invaders and serfdom.http://www.polskaniezwykla.pl/attraction/3258.id Jednaczewo Stach Konwa Legend According to legend, Konwa demonstrated great courage during the Great Northern War in the battle of Kopa≈Ñski bridge with the Swedes on the 22nd and 23 January 1708 near Myszyniec.

The film was made by Two Cities at Teddington Studios. It is based on a 1938 novel of the same title by Louis Golding, who adapted the novel for the screen. Plot summary Set in 1938, Isaac Emmanuel has retired from a Jewish welfare agency in Doomington, England, and is looking for something to do with his time. A letter arrives asking him to come to the aid of a friend who is caring for three German boys who are refugees from Nazi Germany. One of the three, a Jewish boy named Bruno Rosenheim, is very despondent over the recent death of his father and the disappearance of his mother. He waits to get a letter from her, but the letter never arrives. Mr. Emmanuel, a British citizen who himself is a former refugee from Russia, sympathises with the young man. After the lad attempts to take his life, Mr. Emmanuel promises to travel to Germany to find out what he can about Bruno's mother. Once he arrives in Berlin, Emmanuel takes lodging at a boarding-house. He inquires of those around him, not realising how unusual and potentially dangerous it is to do so. Everyone he meets is too scared to give him information. The police and even refugee organisations are also unhelpful. Late one night the Gestapo arrive and take Mr. Emmanuel from his bed to a prison for questioning. The initial line of questioning is of being a spy and communist sympathiser. Mr. Emmanuel believes that his British citizenship will provide some measure of protection, but the police then accuse him of complicity in the assassination of a high-ranking party official, and the criminal charge places Mr. Emmanuel beyond the help of the British embassy. While incarcerated, Mr Emmanuel watches as fellow prisoners are tortured and led off to execution. Elsie Silver, a half-Jewish nightclub singer and the toast of Berlin society, recognises Emmanuel from England, where she grew up. She tries to intervene, but gets nowhere. She convinces her social-climbing Nazi protector to assist, and Emmanuel is released, with twelve hours to leave Germany. Instead of leaving the country, he continues to search for Bruno's mother. He eventually finds her, but she is now married to a prominent Nazi and denies that she is Jewish or that she has a son. Sadly, Mr Emmanuel returns to Britain and tells Bruno that his mother is dead.

In many cases these were vassal states and fiefs established in the fengjian system characterized by tributes paid to the ruling Zhou dynasty (1046-256 BCE). Such states and fiefs would again emerge during later dynasties as a political expedient when required. Rulers of these states were known as zhuhou (). Background According to the sinocentric viewpoint and the Mandate of Heaven, China was the center of the world and the incumbent emperor its only ruler; all other would-be potentates and rulers were merely vassals of the Middle Kingdom. As a result, from the earliest times the Chinese viewed the world as a series of concentric spheres of influence emanating outward from their capital. Within the closest circle lay the vassal states who pledged allegiance to the Zhou ruler. Apart from the Zhou dynasty itself, which occupied territory around its capital, each state bore the suffix -gu√≥ (/) meaning state or nation. Of the 150 or so states,Loewe and Shaughnessy, 'The Cambridge History of Ancient China', 1999, page 567 some were little more than a small fortified town or city, and others had a capital and other urban areas, controlling significant amounts of territory. History =Western Zhou= Following the overthrow of the Shang dynasty in 1046 BCE, the early kings made hereditary land grants to various relatives and descendants. These enfeoffments were accompanied by a title according to the Five Orders of Nobility (‰∫îÁ≠âÁàµ‰Ωç), with only the Zhou ruler bearing the title of \\"King\\" (, w√°ng). Along with the land and title came a responsibility to support the Zhou king during an emergency and to pay ritual homage to the Zhou ancestors. In the Yellow River Valley, of the earliest vassal states, the State of Cai was founded following a grant of land by the first Zhou King to his younger brother. Other states founded at this time included Cao, Yan, Jin, and Chen. The central State of Song was created as a land grant to the nobility of the defeated Shang dynasty. On the periphery, the states of Yan, Qi, and Jin in the north and northeast had more room to expand and grew into large states. In the south, Xiong Yi was granted the fiefdom of Chu, which grew powerful and its later rulers declared themselves kings.Âè≤ËÆ∞ Ê•ö‰∏ñÂÆ∂ (House of Chu, Records of the Grand Historian) At this time, states (such as Yue) that were considered not as civilized were not eligible for vassaldom.Gongyang Zhuan p. 39 Around the borders of the main states lay many smaller entities which over time would be absorbed by their larger neighbors.Book of Songs (ËØóÁªè) =Spring and Autumn period= After an attack by Quanrong nomads allied with several vassal states including Shen and Zheng, the Zhou ruler King You was killed in his palace at Haojing. His son fled east and was enthroned by several vassal leaders as King Ping of Zhou. Thus began the Eastern Zhou Dynasty when a new capital constructed a capital at Luoyi (ÈõíÈÇë), modern day Luoyang. Since territory around the city was restricted because other states including Han and Wei were already established in the area, it was impossible for the Zhou to expand their territory, a factor that became increasingly important as a survival mechanism for smaller states. New states continued to emerge whilst Chu was by this stage a powerful southern vassal, having shaken off its former ‚Äúbarbaric‚Äù image, as was Qin in the West. Between the seventh and sixth centuries a four-way balance of power emerged between Qin (west), Jin (west-center), Chu (south) and Qi (east) whilst a number of smaller states continued to exist between Jin and Qi. The State of Deng was overthrown by Chu in 678 BCE followed by Qin‚Äôs annexation of State of Hua in 627 BCE, establishing a pattern that would gradually see all smaller states eliminated. Towards the end of the Spring and Autumn Period wars between states became increasingly common and a pattern of alliances developed amongst the more powerful rulers. =Hegemons= As the power of the Zhou king‚Äôs weakened, the Spring and Autumn period saw the emergence of hegemons () who held power over all other vassal states to raise armies and attack mutual enemies. Meetings were also held between the current hegemon and the rulers of the vassal states where ritual ceremonies took place that included swearing of oaths of allegiance to the current Zhou king and each other .Zuo Zhuan =Warring States period= In 704 BCE, Chu state leader Xiong Tong (ÁÜäÈÄö) was the first vassal ruler to declare himself equal to the Zhou when he adopted the title King Wu of Chu. All the other states gradually followed suit until Zhou rule finally collapsed in 256 BCE. States continued to emerge as in the case of Zhongshan in the north, which was established by the nomadic Bai Di (ÁôΩÁøü) in the 5th century BCE and would last until 295 BCE. By about 300 BCE, only seven main states remained: Chu, Han, Qi, Qin, Yan, Wei and Zhao. Some of these built rammed earth walls along their frontiers to protect themselves both from the other states and raids by nomadic tribes like the Quanrong and Xiongnu. Smaller states like Zheng and Song were absorbed by their more powerful neighbors. The ‚Äúnon-Chinese‚Äù states of Ba and Shu were both conquered by Qin by 316 BCE. =Qin Empire= Following his unification of China in 221 BCE, the first emperor Qin Shi Huang eliminated noble titles which did not conform to his legalist system of government; one that believed in merit rather than the privileges of birth. He forced all the vassal leaders to attend the capital where he seized their states and turned them into administrative districts classified as either commanderies or counties depending on their size. The officials who ran the new districts were selected on merit rather than by family connections. =Han dynasty= In the early years of the Han dynasty, the commanderies established during the Qin Dynasty once more became vassal states in all but name. Emperor Gaozu (r. 202-195) granted virtually autonomous territories to his relatives and a few generals with military prowess. Over time these vassal states grew powerful and presented a threat to the ruler. Eventually, during the reign of Emperor Jing (r. 156-141 BCE), his political advisor Chao Cuo recommended the abolition of all fiefdoms, a policy that led in 154 BCE to the Rebellion of the Seven Princes. The Prince of Wu Liu Bi (ÂäâÊøû) revolted first and was followed by the rulers of six further states. The rebellion continued for three months until it was finally quelled. Later, Emperor Wu further weakened the power of the vassal states by eliminating many fiefdoms and restoring central control over their prefectures and counties.

He was unsuccessful again at the 1900 general election, when he contested the Nuneaton division, but by a narrower margin of 12.8%.Craig, page 408 He won the seat on his attempt, at the 1906 general election, and remained the Member of Parliament (MP) for Nuneaton it until he retired from Parliament at the 1918 general election. Although first elected as a Liberal party (Lib- Lab) MP, Johnson was required to take the Labour party whip in 1909. This was because of a decision by the Miners Federation of Great Britain, to affiliate to the Labour party. This decision was not popular with the Warwickshire Miners Association or Johnson's local Constituency Party, which refused to affiliate to the Labour party. In 1914, Labour party HQ in London decided to set up a rival Constituency party in Nuneaton and Johnson continued to sit in parliament as a Liberal.  Personal life  In 1868, Johnson married Priscilla Davenport, who died in 1906. He married again in 1908, to Anne, the widow of W. Copson of Leicester.

Under de Nonancourt' s leadership, Laurent-Perrier expanded to become the world's third largest seller of champagne by 2005. He was known as \\"Le Grand Bernard\\" within the industry. De Nonancourt's mother, Marie-Louise Lanson de Nonancourt, purchased the Tours-sur-Marne-based champagne maker that would become Laurent-Perrier in 1938. His older brother, Maurice de Nonancourt, was originally intended to inherit the company from his mother, but he would die in a German concentration camp during World War II. Bernard de Nonancourt and his older brother, Maurice, both joined the French Resistance following the German invasion of France. In 1945, Sergeant de Nonancourt and his forces reached Adolf Hitler's private wine cellar located at Kehlsteinhaus in Bavaria. De Nonancourt blew off the steel doors leading to the cellar, uncovering approximately 500,000 bottles, including hundreds of cases of 1928 Champagne Salon, which had been stolen by German soldiers in 1940. De Nonancourt, who served in the 2nd Armoured Division under General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, was awarded the Croix de guerre for his service. De Nonancourt embarked on a series of apprenticeships and studies after the war in preparation to head the champagne house. He first studied at the √âcole sup√©rieure de commerce de Reims. He then trained at several prominent French champagne houses, including Lanson, which had been acquired by the Nonancourt family at the time. Bernard de Nonancourt assumed control of Laurent-Perrier on October 1, 1948, following his four-year apprenticeship. He remained the head of Laurent-Perrier for more than fifty years. He developed a reputation as an innovator while introducing new products to the Laurent-Perrier product lines. In 1953, de Nonancourt conceived the idea of a new cuv√©e called, which was introduced in 1960 as Grand Si√®cle. De Nonancourt also oversaw the launch of Laurent-Perrier Brut Ros√© in 1968. The introduction of the Brut Ros√© pink champagne in specially shaped bottles proved to be hit with consumers and a financial success for Laurent-Perrier. The Laurent-Perrier house prospered under Bernard de Nonancourt, becoming one of the largest champagne producers in the world. Sales of Laurent-Perrier Group champagne increased one \\"hundredfold\\" between 1950 and 2000. During de Nonancourt's tenure, Laurent- Perrier rose from the one hundredth largest champagne producer to the world's third largest champagne house by 2005. De Nonancourt retired in 2005, assuming the role of honorary chairman and member of supervisory board within Laurent- Perrier. He died on the evening of October 29, 2010, at the age of 90. De Nonancourt was survived by his wife, Claude Merand, and four children. His funeral was held at the Saint Remi Basilica in Reims, France, on November 5, 2010. His two daughters, Alexandra who joined the house in 1987, and St√©phanie, who joined in 1995, were members of the Laurent-Perrier Management board of directors at the time of their father's death. They will become the heads of Laurent-Perrier.

It was abandoned in 1981 but is now an active railroad museum. History In April 1833, the Erie and Kalamazoo Railroad company was given a charter to start the building of a railroad. The Palmyra Jacksonburgh Railroad was the first railway in the state of Michigan. It was built in 1837 - the year that Michigan became a state - as the Tecumseh branch. The charter that was received in 1833 granted them the ability to create a railway that would run through Clinton, Michigan and finish in Jacksonburgh (which is now known as Jackson). The new railroad branch tried to start building in 1838, but because of financial problems the railroad could not be built. However, in 1844 it was sold to the state to be operated by the Southern Railroad, which two years later became the Michigan Southern. After a few years construction began once more. The railroad reached Clinton in 1853, Manchester in 1855, and finally Jacksonburgh in 1857. In 1855, it became part of the Northern Indiana Railroad. Once reaching Jacksonburgh, the branch was completed as the Palmyra Jacksonburgh Railroad. It was bought by the New York Central Railroad system in 1915. From this point until around the 1930s, this railroad was among the causes of the expansion of Southern Michigan. However, starting in the 1930s the use of the train began to dwindle due to increasing automobile ridership. The railroad lost significant revenues from the lack of passenger service. The system still ran on importing and exporting goods throughout the country. In 1963 and 1965 the tracks between Clinton and Jackson were removed, cutting the branch off from businesses. New York Central folded into Penn Central Railroad in 1968. In 1970 Penn Central filed for bankruptcy in 1970, and in 1981 its successor, Conrail, filed to abandon the track.Michigan Railroads Southern Michigan Railroad Society In 1985 the Southern Michigan Railroad Society, led by three high school students, purchased the Clinton Branch and transformed it into an operating railroad museum. The society continues to preserve, restore, and to educate the public about the first railroad in Michigan. They offer various trips on the remaining tracks of what used to be an operating railroad, and work on a volunteer basis.Southern Michigan Railroad Museum Historical Tours Many of the events they offer are a tour during the Clinton Fall Festival, a tour during the Appleumpkin Festival, and the Fall Colors tour. They also feature a few winter excursions. These are the Tecumseh Holiday Open House, and a tour through the Tecumseh Holiday Lighted Parade.

The winery expanded its vineyard holdings to over in the Awatere Valley, and purchased the Hawke's Bay-based winery Crossroads in 2011. Exports helped grow the business and its commercial success has resulted in several awards for its Sauvignon Blanc wines and sustainability efforts. In 2016 Yealands sold its Crossroads winery facility and land and moved to transporting its Hawke's Bay grapes to its Marlborough winery. = Export offence conviction and takeover = After an investigation by the Ministry for Primary Industries, Yealands and two other staff were sentenced in 2018 under New Zealand's Wine Act 2003 for illegally adding sugar to wine exported to the European Union between 2013 and 2015, and falsifying records to conceal the activity. Marlborough Lines, who had already purchased a controlling stake in 2015, agreed not to sue Yealands in return for his resignation and remaining shares. The case has caused concerns in the New Zealand wine industry about its international reputation.  Sustainability  The winery as one of its founding goals took early steps to implement a high level of sustainability in its operating practices. These practices include using sheep and chickens to control weeds and pests, conserving water usage, establishing wetlands to improve biodiversity, and using recycled materials for glass bottles and packaging. The 412 kW photovoltaic solar cell system installed at the winery is the largest single solar array in New Zealand. The winery later ran into trouble with its waste reuse initiative to process pomace into feedstock, receiving penalties for inadequate construction of the storage facility and subsequent pollution of a local waterway. The winery has redoubled its sustainability drive since the 2018 takeover, committing to reducing its carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2030, and 80 percent by 2045.

Life Scouler, the son of a calico-printer, was born in Glasgow on 31 December 1804. He received the rudiments of his education at Kilbarchan, but was sent very early to the University of Glasgow. When his medical course there was completed, he went to Paris and studied at the Jardin des Plantes. On moving to England, Dr. (afterwards Sir) William Jackson Hooker secured for him an appointment as surgeon and naturalist on board the Hudson's Bay Company's ship William and Ann. The vessel sailed from London on 25 July 1824 for the Columbia River, touching at Madeira, Rio de Janeiro and the Galapagos. His companion on the voyage out and in many excursions at the several ports was the botanist, David Douglas. Scouler's journal of the voyage reports the instruction he received from early workers on Vancouver's expedition, such as Archibald Menzies, familiarising himself with the botany of the region and the preparation of specimens. His stay at the Columbia river appears to have lasted from April to September 1825.Edinb. Journ. Sci. vols. v. vi. The voyage returned in the early part of 1826. Soon after his return to England, Scouler shipped as surgeon on the Clyde, a merchant vessel that went to Calcutta, touching by the way at Cape Horn and Madras. On his return to Glasgow, he settled down to practice medicine (graduating M.D. in 1827), until he was appointed, on 18 June 1829, professor of geology and natural history and mineralogy in the Andersonian University. In 1834, he was appointed professor of mineralogy, and subsequently of geology, zoology, and botany, to the Royal Dublin Society, a post he held until his retirement on a pension in 1854, when he returned to Glasgow. The state of his health in 1853 and 1854 induced him to visit Portugal. He also made a tour in the Netherlands and, in later years, visited Scandinavia. After his retirement he occasionally lectured and he superintended the Andersonian Museum. He had been elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1829, and made LL.D. of Glasgow in 1850. He died at Glasgow on 13 November 1871. He was buried at Kilbarchan. Scouler was the author of more than twenty papers on various natural history subjects and meteorology published between 1826 and 1852. He established, with two medical colleagues, the Glasgow Medical Journal, and in 1831 was one of the editors of Cheek's Edinburgh Journal of Natural and Geographical Science. He contributed notes and an appendix to the fourth edition of Dr. King's Principles of Geology explained (8vo, Edinburgh, 1853). Scouleria, a genus of plants, and Scoulerite, a mineral, were named in his honour. Other species epithets, such as Enicurus scouleri and Hypericum scouleri commemorate his name. Scouler made large collections of specimens in the western regions of North America and the Galapagos. He bequeathed his books, which included many of great rarity, to Stirling's Library in Glasgow.

The approximate construction date for the Walke House is known from local land records, which show that the value of the property rose from $5 to $223 per acre shortly after 1812. It appears that the building was constructed under Thomas James, who owned this piece of land from 1812 to 1819; however, it seems that he never finished construction, for land records suggest that it was completed under the ownership of Cadwallader Wallace, who owned it from 1819 to 1820.

The purpose of the uprising was to revolt against the incorporation of the Indonesian federated \\"states\\" into the Indonesian Republic. However, the uprising was quashed in a little over two weeks when troops under Lieutenant Colonel Suharto and Colonel Alexander Evert Kawilarang arrived at Makassar to find only light resistance. The East Indonesian government refused to condone Aziz's actions and he was subsequently arrested in Jakarta on 14April while attempting to negotiate with the republician authorities. The Makassar Uprising only facilitated republican control over the federal states.  Background  Following the end of World War II in August 1945, the Dutch sought to re-establish control over the East Indies, modern-day Indonesia. While Australian and Dutch troops managed to occupy much of eastern Indonesia with minimal resistance,Kahin (1952), p. 355 Anglo-Dutch forces in Java and Sumatra were challenged by nascent Republican nationalists advocating self-rule under Sukarno.Vickers (1952), p. 97 The Republican goal of a unitary Republic of Indonesia centered on Java clashed with Dutch decolonization efforts to implement a system of federal states which was part of a Dutch commonwealth. Negotiations were dogged by skirmishes and police actions.Kahin (1952), p. 446-52 In Sulawesi, resistance to Dutch rule was successfully suppressed by Captain Raymond Westerling, who drew controversy for his use of arbitrary terror tactics including rounding up villages and summarily executing members until they submitted information.Kahin (1952), p. 356 However, the eradication of Republican forces paved the way for the establishment of a more amenable East Indonesian civil administration based in Makassar.Westerling (1952), p. 210 In South Sulawesi, they also replaced more than a quarter of the pro-Republican local nobility including the Rajahs of Bone and Lawu, prompting the remaining rajahs to collaborate with the Dutch authorities. In December 1948, the Dutch launched a second police action Operatie Kraai which succeeded in capturing much of Java and Sumatra as well as the Republican leadership in Yogyakarta. However, this action only fuelled opposition to the Dutch in the United Nations, the United States, Australia and India. The United States threatened to suspend Marshall plan aid to the Dutch including funds vital for Dutch post-World War II rebuilding that had so far totalled $US 1 billion.Friend (2003), page 37 The Netherlands Government had spent an amount equivalent to almost half of this funding their campaigns in Indonesia.Friend (2003), page 38 On 24 December, the UN Security Council called for the end of hostilities. In January 1949, it passed a resolution demanding the reinstatement of the Republican government. International pressure forced the Dutch to continue negotiations with the Republicans, culminating in the Dutch agreeing to recognise Indonesian sovereignty over a new federal state known as the United States of Indonesia (RUSI). It would include all the territory of the former Dutch East Indies with the exception of Netherlands New Guinea; sovereignty over which it was agreed would be retained by the Netherlands until further negotiations with Indonesia. Sovereignty was transferred on December 27, 1949. The new RUSI government consisted of both Republicans and Federalists but was short-lived due to animosity between the two parties and growing popular support for a unitary state.Kahin (1952), p. 448-48 On January 23, 1950, Westerling and the federalist Cabinet member Sultan Hamid II attempted to overthrow the Republican government by using Westerling‚Äôs private Legion of Ratu Adil to launch simultaneous attacks on Bandung, Jakarta and Blora in the short-lived APRA Coup d'√©tat. The coup failed since the majority of the KNIL leadership refused to support Westerling‚Äôs actions and intercepted his munitions convoy.Westerling(1952), p. 191-92 This only added fuel to public dissatisfaction with the federal system, leading to the integration of the states of Pasundan and West Kalimantan into the Republic of Indonesia by April 1950.Kahin (1952), p. 456  The uprising  Due to the strong presence of KNIL troops in Sulawesi and other parts of East Indonesia, there was much suspicion towards the intentions of the unitary central government in Jakarta. Efforts were made to integrate the KNIL into the RUSI army, but this was impeded by mutual distrust between the predominantly Javanese Indonesian military and the largely Ambonese and Minahasan KNIL. In the State of East Indonesia, the Justice Minister Soumokil banned all public meetings and jailed pro-Republican leaders in response to public pro-Republic protests. On April 5, 1950, the Jakarta central government dispatched a force of 700 Republican troops under Colonel Sunkono and Colonel Mokoginto to persuade the East Indonesian President Soekawati to join the Republic and to step down. These troops were further augmented by 200 pro-Republican guerrillas in the Makassar region.Westerling (1952), p. 210-11 Fears that this deployment would shift the balance in favour of pro-Republican elements and lead to disorder prompted Soumokil and other pro-federal elements to convince the local KNIL forces to launch a coup.Kahin (1952), p. 457 KNIL Captain Andi Aziz commanded a force of 350 KNIL troops in Makassar. At the urging of Soumokil, Aziz's force overwhelmed the few local Republican troops and their guerrilla allies before seizing control of the city. They then prevented the 700 RUSI reinforcements from landing by firing artillery at their troop transports, forcing them to retreat. Aziz defended his actions by claiming to uphold the Federal Constitution which guaranteed the autonomy of the federal states including East Indonesia. He also claimed that he had discovered documents alleging that Sukarno was collaborating with the Indonesian Communist Party and the Soviet Union to destroy the ‚Äúcapitalist and upper classes‚Äù and establish a unitary state, paving the way for a communist take-over.Westerling (1952), p. 212 However, most of the East Indonesian government including President Soekawati refused to condone or support his coup. By April 13, President Sukarno had denounced Aziz's insurgency and deployed RUSI forces to crush the rebellion in South Sulawesi. Wanting to maintain working relations with the Jakarta government, Soekawati convinced Aziz to come to Jakarta to negotiate with Sukarno‚Äôs government. He was also granted a safe-conduct pass by Sukarno and the United Nations Commission for Indonesia to fly to Jakarta. However upon arrival, he was arrested by the Sultan of Yogyakarta Hamengkubuwono IX who incarcerated him in his private prison.Westerling (1952), p. 213 The capture of Aziz ended resistance and allowed 2,000 RUSI troops to swiftly occupy Makassar by April 21.Palmer (1962), p. 78  Aftermath  The elimination of the KNIL as a political actor allowed Republican factions in the East Indonesian parliament to assume a majority. The federalist Prime Minister Diapari was replaced by Putuhena, who declared martial law and established an Emergency Government in South Sulawesi which was controlled directly by Jakarta. Following the release of Republican political prisoners, guerrilla forces in the upland regions launched attacks against pro-Dutch aristocrats in the urban areas. This led to further fighting with the remaining KNIL units and the abolishment of local aristocratic principalities. The new East Indonesian Cabinet was pro-Republican and advocated the integration of East Indonesia into the unitary Indonesian Republic. On April 21, 1950, President Soekawati successfully negotiated East Indonesia's integration, heeding majority support for a unitary state. This prompted all thirteen constituent territories within East Indonesia with the exception of South Moluccas to secede from East Indonesia and join Sukarno‚Äôs Republic.Kahin (1952), p. 460 Following further negotiations, the RUSI was dissolved on August 15 in favour of a unitary Republic of Indonesia.Kahin (1952), p. 463 Due to his leading role in the uprising, Aziz was subsequently tried in 1952 and sentenced to 14 years imprisonment.

Gameplay The game essentially combines a traditional golf tournament with a plot by a mad professor to take over the world while using that golf tournament as its legitimate front. Yui Mizuhara and Ran Ryuzaki are two normal high school girls who are excellent at golf so they get drafted for this assignment. They are abducted by Professor G, but Yui is liberated before he can brainwash her into his organization. Players can talk to their opponents before teeing against them in oddly-themed golf courses. Special abilities can be invoked at a certain cost to the attribute that is the equivalent of magic points in standard role-playing games.

His works on tajwid and qira'at are considered classics. The nisba (attributive title), Jazari, denotes an origin from Jazirat ibn 'Umar.  Biography  Al-Jazari was born in Damascus on Friday 26 November 1350 (25 Ramadan 751 AH), at a time where his parents were long past the age of having children, yet his father (a merchant), had not given up all hope of having a child even after 40 years of marriage. It is said that Al-Jazari was born after his father's prayers for a son during the Hajj. He completed the memorization of the Qur'an at the age of 13 and learned the art of Qur'anic recitation at an early age. In Damascus, al-Jazari founded and headed Dar al-Qur'an, a school that specialized in Qur'anic sciences. He travelled to Mecca, Medina, Cairo and Alexandria where he took knowledge from its scholars and in 774 AH, he was authorized by his teacher Ibn Kathir to issue verdicts in Islamic law. He served as a qadi (judge) of Damascus in 793 AH and later in Shiraz where he died. He wrote two large poems about Qira'at and tajwid. One was Durrat Al-Maa'nia () , in the readings of three major reciters, added to the seven in the Shatibiyyah, making it ten. The other is Tayyibat An-Nashr (), which is 1014 lines on the ten major reciters in great detail, of which he also wrote a commentary. Al- Jazri died at the age of 79 on Friday 2 December 1429 (5 Rabi' al-awwal 833 AH) in Shiraz, Iran. Selected Works  Al-Jazari compiled more than 90 works on qira'at (readings), ·∏•adƒ´th (traditions), ta‚Äôrƒ´kh (history) and other disciplines.

A session (from the Latin word sessio, which means \\"to sit\\", as in sitting to deliberate or talk about something; sometimes called consistory or church board) is a body of elected elders governing each local church within presbyterian polity. Organization These groups of elders make decisions for the local parish through a ruling body called the Kirk session (Latin. sessio from sedere \\"to sit\\"), sometimes the Session, church session, or (in Continental Reformed usage) consistory. The members of the session are the pastor (Teaching Elder) of that congregation, and the other ruling elders (sometimes called \\"lay elders\\"). Elders are ordained for life, so if they are subsequently elected or appointed to Sessions at later points in their life, they are inducted, there being no second ordination. In most denominations, the pastor serves as Moderator of the Session and thus convenes or presides over the session. All elders have an equal vote in the session. In some denominations, the pastor is given no vote. However, in a sitting body of an even number or with a quorum of the session counted, the pastor can break a tie with a casting vote. In the Polity of the Presbyterian Church (USA), the pastor and associate pastor have a vote as members of the session on any and all matters.PCUSA Book of Order G-10.0101 However, the pastor will often refrain from voting except in tie situations. The Pastor is not a voting member of the congregation.PCUSA Book of Order G-7.0308 The Ordination of Elders in a Scottish Kirk, by John Henry Lorimer, 1891. National Gallery of Scotland The elders who are members of Session have both executive powers as a group and pastoral responsibility. Many elders will be in regular pastoral contact with a group of the members of the congregation and their families. In the pastoral function elders rarely bring issues to Session meetings, resolving them privately or with the aid of the minister or other counsellor. In executive function a number of Sessions have complete authority (under presbytery) for the ordering of all business, spiritual and temporal, of their congregation. This condition is known in the Church of Scotland as \\"quoad omnia\\". Other congregations have a separate \\"Congregational Board\\", \\"Deacons' court\\" or \\"Management Committee\\" which deals with financial details and the maintenance of property. The financial board thus relieves the Session of much routine responsibility but remains under the direction of the Session. Kirk Sessions remain the first court of the presbyterian church. They are under the jurisdiction of the presbytery of the bounds to which they commission the minister and at least one ruling elder. The minister is not a member of the congregation but of the presbytery, thus he or she is under the spiritual oversight of the presbytery. The members of the congregation, including the ruling elders, are under the spiritual oversight of the Kirk Session. This is a practical manifestation of the protestant doctrine of the priesthood of all believers and as all elders are Ordained, some to rule and others to teach, the Moderator of the Kirk Session sits as a chairman of the elders primus inter pares. Clerk of Session The person who takes minutes for the Session and maintains all of the church's ledgers of membership, births, baptisms, deaths, and elders is known as the Clerk of Session. However, the role takes on a special significance well beyond its stated duties. In leadership and influence across the congregation, the Session Clerk is a partner with the Minister and often speaks for the Congregation and Elders in offering words of guidance and encouragement to the Minister as well as being the key to marshalling resources and support to implement the Minister's projects.

Unlike the traditional activist groups and NGOs in India, members of this non- profit group interact largely via Internet-based social media tools. History The group started in 2007 when enthusiasts built a collaborative blog for discussions on civic issues pertaining to Bangalore. Content was moderated for language and references, and tended to be very analytical. The virtual group met face-to-face for the first time during a visit to the then under-construction Bangalore International Airport. As the virtual community grew in size, some members felt the need for a real-world organization to interact with local governments, in order to better effect changes. A society was created to formalize this non-profit organization. Current status Praja RAAG is largely confined to Bangalore, though there have been efforts to spread the project to the cities of Mysore, Pune, and Chennai. The group has evolved to undertake projects based on volunteers' time and support, along with resources from academic institutions, local governments, and industry partners. The group has so far focused largely on land-based public transportation issues. They have interacted with BMTC regarding marketing, availability of information and last mile issues, and with South Western Railways for Bangalore Commuter Rail.  Projects  In November 2009, in association with the Center for Infrastructure, Sustainable Transport and Urban Planning of the Indian Institute of Science, Praja RAAG organized the first edition of Mobilicity, a brainstorming event designed to produce practical transportation solutions and kick start sustainable mobility initiatives for Bangalore. After this first edition of Mobilicity, members of Praja RAAG helped BMTC conceptualize and implement the Bus Day campaign, which promoted the use of buses instead of cars. The group is also spearheading an advocacy project for implementing a Commuter Rail System in Bangalore,. Thanks to this advocacy, and support from Department of Urban Land Transport, state of Karnataka, RITES undertook a detailed feasibility study indicating cost estimates and a phase wise plan for starting Commuter Rail Service in Bangalore. Among other recent projects, Praja RAAG has done significant advocacy for Non Motorized Transportation (NMT) via designated cycle tracks, and has been pitching for BRTS in Bangalore via advocacy efforts for a concept named Bus Priority System.  Awards  The citizen community site praja.in won an award for Social Media Usage at the India eGov 2.0 Awards in October 2010. In October 2011, Praja RAAG received a special mention from Volvo for encouraging positive initiatives to support sustainable Mobility. In October 2012, Namma Railu, a Praja RAAG project was declared the runner up for Volvo Sustainable Mobility Award. Criticism Praja RAAG has been criticized for its largely internet-based presence.

They have erect ears, a wedge-shaped head, and a curved tail. It is easily trainable and often used as a guard dog and police dog. This dog is an example of an ancient group of dogs known as pye-dogs. It is possible that the ancestors of this dog dates back 4,500 years ago. Though most street dogs in the Indian subcontinent are in fact Indian pye-dogs, the names for this breed are often erroneously used to refer to all urban South Asian stray dogs despite the fact that some free-ranging dogs in the Indian subcontinent do not match the \\"pariah type\\" and may not be pure indigenous dogs but mixed breeds, especially around locations where European colonists historically settled in India, due to admixtures with European dog breeds. Appearance It is a medium-sized dog of square to slightly rectangular build and short coat. The dog has a double coat, a coarse upper coat, and a soft undercoat. The most commonly observed colours are browns, ranging from dark to reddish-brown, with or without white markings. Solid blacks are rare, but some dogs are pied. Shaded coats, brindles, solid white and dalmatian-type spotting are never seen in pure populations. These may be a sign of mixing with modern breeds, as they are only seen in dogs in cities and other sites where non-native dogs have been introduced. The head is medium-sized and wedge-shaped. The muzzle is pointed and is of equal or slightly greater length than the head. The neck is noble and the forequarters are erect. Hindquarters are minimally angled. The trot is short. The eyes are almond-shaped and dark brown in colour. The ears are held erect and are pointed at the tips, with a broad base, set low on the head, and the tail is curled and held high when excited. Names Indian pye- dogs have been used as guard dogs for centuries. The namesake of this breed was given during the British Raj in India after the Pariah tribe of the Madras Presidency. From the Anglo-Indian word pye or pa√´ and Hindi pƒÅhƒ´ meaning 'outsider', the Indian pariah dog is sometimes referred to as the pye-dog (also spelt pie or pi) and the Indian native dog.Merriam-Webster Dictionary It is popularly known as Desi Kutta or Desi Dog (which derives from the Hindustani word desi, meaning native), as well as the Indi-dog or In-dog (in various spellings). People in Northern India and Pakistan call it \\"desi kutta\\" (‡§¶‡•á‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•Å‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§æ, ) which means native dog in Hindustani. In Bengali they are named as \\"Neri Kukur\\" (‡¶®‡ßá‡¶°‡¶º‡¶ø ‡¶ï‡ßÅ‡¶ï‡ßÅ‡¶∞). In Himachali, they are named as \\"luru\\". In Assamese language these native dogs are termed as bhotua (‡¶≠‡¶§‡ßÅ‡ß±‡¶æ ‡¶ï‡ßÅ‡¶ï‡ßÅ‡ß∞) kukur. This breed is known as \\"naadan\\" (‡¥®‡¥æ‡¥ü‡µª) in Malayalam (Kerala), \\"naatu naai\\" (‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡ØÅ ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡Øç) (country dog) in Tamil (Tamil Nadu), \\"oora kukka\\" (‡∞ä‡∞∞ ‡∞ï‡±Å‡∞ï‡±ç‡∞ï) in Telugu language in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, \\"ooru naai\\" (‡≤ä‡≤∞‡≥Å ‡≤®‡≤æ‡≤Ø‡≤ø) in Kannada, \\"gavthi kutra\\" ( ‡§ó‡§æ‡§µ‡§†‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•Å‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ) in Marathi language in Maharashtra and \\"Bhusya Kukkur\\" (‡§≠‡•Ç‡§∏‡•Ä‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ï‡•Å‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞) in Nepal. It was referred to in the works of Rudyard Kipling as the \\"yellow pariah dog\\".Kipling, Rudyard. (1894) The Jungle Book.  History  A pet Indian pariah dog in Raigarh The pariah dog of India is an ancient autochthonous landrace that is found all over India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and even beyond South Asia. A pariah-like dog skull was discovered in the ancient Indian site of Mohenjo-daro and prehistoric rock art depicting a dog of similar type has been found in the Bhimbetka rock shelters. It was featured on National Geographic Channel's film, Search for the First Dog along with the other related ancient types such as the Canaan Dog of Israel and the Australian dingo. The Indian pye-dog was introduced to the Andaman Islands with the establishment of a penal colony there, dogs having been previously unknown to the native Andamanese. Despite the Indian pariah dog being highly intelligent and easily trainable, the breed was intentionally downplayed during the British Raj by merchants who wished to sell their foreign breeds within the country. Their popularity in the West in recent years, however, has resulted in hundreds of dogs being exported out of the Indian subcontinent. In 2015, a breed standard was published in the Indian Kennel Gazette, the publication of Kennel Club of India, and the dog has been recognized by the Primitive and Aboriginal Dog Society (PADS), a worldwide grouping of enthusiasts based in the US. Some in the society view these dogs as a risk citing their increasing population in India in recent years. They consider these dogs as menace and nuisance owing to constant barking and biting people. Nevertheless, most of these attacks are caused due to human provocation like hitting them with sticks or throwing stones at them.https://mediaindia.eu/social-vibes/stray-dogs-a-major-problem- in-india/ The numbers of dog bites and deaths due to dog attacks are increasing every year. Since these dogs are largely not vaccinated, they frequently carry rabies.https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/07/world/asia/india- stray-dogs-are-a-menace.html Temperament Pariah dogs are very alert and social. They are used as guard dogs and police dogs, being very territorial and defensive. They need good socializing as pups and do well with families and children if provided with such socialization. They are highly intelligent and easily trainable; to this end, veterinarian Premlata Choudhary stated that \\"desi dogs are much more intelligent and hardy than most pedigreed dogs that people spend so much money on.\\" Health Being a naturally evolved breed, they have very few health concerns and thrive with minimal maintenance in suitable climates. The skin needs very little grooming and the dogs themselves are relatively clean. They have little body odour. Genetic health ailments like hip dysplasia are extremely rare, since there is no inbreeding and the dominant genes that aid their survival are naturally selected over time. Most of their deaths occur due to accidents on the roads and railway tracks, not getting food or drinking polluted water, tumors in the body, getting bit by snakes or being beaten up by humans.

The community was so named from the expectation the new railroad line would eventually extend from Minnesota Junction to the Minnesota Territory. A post office was established in Minnesota Junction in 1861, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1940. The junction was situation where a north‚Äìsouth branch of the Chicago and North Western Railway met an east‚Äìwest branch of the Milwaukee Road. The north‚Äìsouth line was abandoned in 1984, and is now a rail trail, while the east‚Äìwest line is still operated by the Wisconsin and Southern Railroad.

Academic career  Chattopadhyay passed the entrance examination and graduated with a B.A. (Hons) degree from the University of Calcutta. One of his classmates was the writer Khagendranath Mitra.  Teaching career  Nagendranath joined the 'Bhagabati Vidyalaya' at Birsingha village, appointed as the headmaster of the institution established by Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar for female education, but he left after a short time. It is reported that at the time the institute was a mere mud thatched and straw-shedded hut. One Nabagopal Das, the SDO of Arambagh Subdivision arranged for his joining as the headmaster at Arambagh High English School, where he served for the rest of his career, spanning more than 40 years. There is an incident with a school inspector which merits description as it fully shows his in-depth knowledge of grammar. The story goes \\"once an inspector came to his school and observed him teaching English grammar to the students. Chattopadhyay used the term 'averse from' instead of the Nesfield style 'averse to'. Shocked, the inspector openly challenged him. To his disbelief, Chattopadhyay pulled out from the library the treatise of Rosewood indicating that it advocates 'averse from'. He also presented with the arguments indicating his grammatical sense was extraordinary.\\" The inspector was awed by Chattopadhyay. He also worked on society problems and in one occasion, received a silver medal and a silver engraved stick from the Bengal government due to his part in successfully observing the 'Water Hyacinth Day' in Teghory Basantapore nearer to Arambagh in the Kana Nadi.  Administrative career  He was also a member of the district board. One 'Kala-ajar centre' was also opened which was in no small part due to his endeavour. He was an elected non- party member of the district Union Board until the later West Bengal chief minister Prafulla Chandra Sen defeated him in 1937; even then their relation was reported to be cordial and warm.  Family  Nagendrantah Chattopadhyay had four sons and one daughter. Nagendranath Chattopadhyay's grandson Dr Rabiranjan Chattopadhyay was a professor of Burdwan University in West Bengal and is a current member of West Bengal Legislative Assembly representing Bardhaman Dakhsin constituency.

It is an important section of the so-called Saxon-Franconian trunk line from Dresden to Nuremberg. The line was opened in 1853 and is one of the oldest railways in Germany. History  It was the first Bavarian railway line to be built and leased to the state. That is, it was financed by the city of Bayreuth and the line was built and subsequently leased by the Bavarian government. The route from Neuenmarkt to Bayreuth was opened on 28 November 1853 by the Royal Bavarian State Railways as one of the first branch lines of the Ludwig South-North Railway. In 1905 the line was nationalised. Operations The line connects with the Bamberg‚ÄìHof line in Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg, leading to Bamberg and Hof. Services are operated approximately hourly between Bayreuth and Bamberg by agilis. In the past trains from Bayreuth had to change direction in Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg to continue up the famous Schiefe Ebene () to Hof. The opening of the Schl√∂men curve in 2001, which allows Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg to be bypassed to the east, improved the connectivity of the line to the northeast considerably. As a result, even some long-distance trains (ICE TD) on the Nuremberg‚ÄìDresden route now use the line. December 2006 to December 2013, services of the Franken- Sachsen-Express ran on the line at 2-hour intervals, after a period when no trains used the Schloemen curve at all. A Regional-Express service has run every two hours on the Nuremberg‚ÄìBayreuth‚ÄìHof route since 15 December 2013.

Narsimhan. This film stars Ravichandran, Meena, Umashri, Lokesh in lead roles. Music was composed by Hamsalekha. The film's plot was inspired by the 1972 Tamil movie Pattikada Pattanama.

Putnanja was a man respected by everyone in the village and was well-known to all for his kindness towards poor and backward. When Putnanja hears a news regarding arrival of Roja (Meena) to India (who went to America for studies during childhood and whom Putnanja likes and wants to marry) he rushes towards her place to propose her to marry him. When Putnanja goes and proposes her, she does not even recognize him, and suggests not to talk about their marriage in future days. Putnanja's mother-in-law wants her daughter Roja to marry a rich, educated person and hence opposes Putnanja's proposal, but his father-in-law (Lokesh) wants her daughter to marry him since he is very kind and a good man. Lokesh can't do anything he wants since he would be working as slave to his wife. Once Putnanja proposes Roja's family to come to their village festival and spend some days with them, Taara refuses to go, but due to her daughter's stubborn she accepts to go to their village. Roja likes the tour very much and she even starts liking Ravichandran due to his kindness towards people. After returning to the city Lokesh manages to convince Roja to marry Putnanja even though her mother opposes it. As day passes Roja tries to enjoy life in village in the city manner neglecting all the rules that has to be followed in the village and one day she reaches above limit range by burning the plouge which is treated as god by the villagers.

Banji Akintoye (born 1935), is a Nigerian-born academic, historian and writer. He attended Christ's School Ado Ekiti, Nigeria from 1951‚Äì1955, search for Akintoye and studied history at the University College (Overseas College of the University of London), Ibadan (1956‚Äì1961), and doctoral studies from 1963-1966 at the University of Ibadan, where he was awarded a PhD in History in 1966. He taught at the History Department at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria, where he became a professor and Director of the Institute of African Studies from 1974-1977. He has also taught African History in universities in the United States including the University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida; Montgomery County Community College, PA, and Eastern University, St. Davids, Pennsylvania. Akintoye has written four books, chapters in many joint books, and several articles in scholarly journals. He took a leading part for some time in the politics of Nigeria and served on the Nigerian Senate from 1979‚Äì1983 during the Second Republic. He currently lives in Pennsylvania in the United States. Akintoye is one of the current leading scholars on the history of the Yoruba people. His most recent work, A History of the Yoruba People (Amalion, 2010), draws on decades of new findings and thinking on Yoruba studies that challenges some previously dominant notions about the origins of the Yoruba. This work dispels the Middle Eastern and Arabia origins propounded by such scholars as the late Samuel Johnson (1846‚Äì1901) and also gave prominence to the works on the Pre- Oduduwa Period by Ulli Beier among others. Akintoye also gave prominence to the role of Il√©-If√® over that of Oyo. A reviewer, Wale Adebanwi, notes: \\"...this book directly contests and shifts the focus of Yoruba history away from what many have called the Oyo-centric account of Samuel Johnson... Where Johnson avoids the creation myth that positions Ife as the sacred locus of Oduduwa's original descent and the orirun (creation-source), Akintoye, justifiably, restores Ile-Ife to its proper place as \\"ibi ojumo ti mon wa'ye\\" (where the dawn emerges)...\\"Wale Adebanwi, \\"A Handle on History: Review of Professor Adebanji Akintoye's A History of the Yoruba People\\", Dakar: Amalion Publishing, 2010; Premier Hotel, Ibadan, Nigeria. 22 April 2010.

It was originally produced as part of his abandoned television special, Orson's Bag, which was made for CBS; but in 1969, with the project close to completion, CBS withdrew their funding over Welles' long-running disputes with US authorities regarding his tax status. The film remained uncompleted. Despite its name, Vienna freely mixes footage shot in Vienna, Zagreb, and in a Los Angeles studio. The 8-minute segment was restored by the Munich Film Museum in 1999. Plot Vienna is an eclectic blend of faux-documentary and comical skits. Welles presents a leisurely guided tour of \\"Vienna,\\" commenting on the city and its inhabitants. He visits the Sacher Hotel, and the Wiener Riesenrad (Great Wheel) at the Prater amusement park, both of which appeared in the 1949 film The Third Man, in which Welles had a starring role. Peter Bogdanovich, disguised in a trench coat and dark glasses, appears as Welles' magician assistant.

The firm was a partnership of Wallace Harrison and Max Abramovitz. History The firm, founded in 1941 by Wallace Harrison (1895‚Äì1981),Eve M.

One notable stylistic innovation was the use of stamped metal panels on the facade, first at the 1953 Alcoa Building in Pittsburgh, and repeated at the 1953 Republic Center Tower I in Dallas and the 1956 former Socony‚ÄìMobil Building at 150 East 42nd Street in New York City. Both Harrison and Abramovitz were design architects and worked independently. Some projects are clearly attributable to one or the other: for instance the buildings at University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, Abramovitz's alma mater, are his designs.

Directed by Goutam Ghose, the film has Prosenjit as the lead actor portraying the character of Lalan Fakir. Paoli Dam plays the character of Komli, the key female disciple of Lalan. Moner Manush has been regarded as one of the best creations of recent times, based on the response received by people of Bengal. This effort from Goutom Ghosh comes in the time of growing Bengali movies. The movie has won the award for Best Feature Film on National Integration at 58th National Film Award. Plot Rabindranath Tagore's elder brother Jyotirindranath Tagore, a Western educated bright young man from the 19th century Bengal met the octogenarian Lalan Fakir and drew a portrait of the poet saint in the former houseboat afloat on the Padma river. Jyotirindranath, an urban intellectual, exchanges views with the man of native wisdom. Their exchange of ideas forms the cinematic narrative of this film. The narrative is a saga of the life and time of Lalan Fakir and his liberal sect who lived a life of high order in an otherwise superstitious 19th century Indian society. Lalan inherited the best of the liberal and enlightened tradition of Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam to develop a philosophy of life which is extremely secular and tolerant. Thus became an easy prey for the fundamentalists from the Hindu and the Muslim institutions. They were the parallel stream flowing freely in the heart of rural Bengal when men like Tagore were germinating ideas of the Bengal Renaissance. The love and compassion of Lalan is relevant more than ever in today's world of intolerance and hate.

Background Medieval Serbia is an heir of Constantine the Great's Byzantium, the eastern part of the Roman Empire. Serbian Old Church Slavonic literature was created on Byzantine model, and at first church services and biblical texts were translated into Slavic, and soon afterward other works for Christian life values from which they attained necessary knowledge in various fields (including Latin works). Although this Christian literature educated the Slavs, it did not have an overwhelming influence on original works. Instead, a more narrow aspect, the genres, and poetics with which the cult of saints could be celebrated were used, owing to the Slavic celebration of Cyril and Methodius and their Slav disciples as saints and those responsible for Slavic literacy. The ritual genres were hagiographies, homiletics and hymnography, known in Slavic as ≈æitije (vita), pohvala (eulogy), slu≈æbe (church services), effectively meaning prose, rhetoric, and poetry. The fact that the first Slavic works were in the canonical form of ritual literature, and that the literary language was the ritual Slavic language, defined the further development. Codex Marianus represents the oldest found manuscript dating back to the 11th century, if not older, written in medieval Serbian recension of Old Slavonic. Medieval Slavic literature, especially Serbian, was modeled on this classical Slavic literature. The new themes in Serbian literature were all created within the classic ritual genres. The oldest known work to date of Serbian secular literature is the legend of Vladimir and Kosara recorded in writing in the Serbian state of Duklja in the 11th century. Surviving only in excerpts and in translation, it is both a love story and a heroic song about the righteous Prince Vladimir, executed unjustly in 1016 in consequence of a struggle for the throne. Origin Saint Sava, founder of the medieval Serbian literature. Unlike the countries of Western Europe, Serbia traces its history, literature, artistic, religious and cultural heritage when Christianity became a state religion during the time of Constantine the Great and New Rome. Between the 10th and 13th century, however, the foundations of independent Serbian literature was formed through its Old Serbian Vita. In this period, the direction and character of literature were built with an elementary system of genres in its main guidelines, with a selected and modified literary language. Only with the works of Saint Sava and the development of the autocephalous Serbian church did the Serbian literature receive the content that would make it an equal and active participant in the literary life of the Orthodox Slavic world. Also, we must not ignore the role that the Serbian Chancellery in Dubrovnik (Ragusa) played in the history of Serbian Cyrillic. Hence, the 13th century was not only the new but main stage in the constitution of Serbian medieval literature. This stage ended sometime prior to the end of the century, with the ultimate standardization of the Rascian orthography in literacy and completing the creation of the main genres of the period: the Hagiography (≈æitije) and Divine Service (slu≈æba). The main literary centers of the early Nemanjiƒá state were finally established by the end of the 13th century: Hilandar, Studenica, ≈Ωiƒça, Mile≈°eva, Peƒá; in which the supply of Old Slavic general literature was filled with works of Serbian, domestic literary workshops. In the course of this century, Serbian literature sought to reach the height of Byzantine-Slavic literature, to join the community. The motive of these activities, its main driver, is in the creation of Serbian Orthodox cults, cults of the holy dynasty (the Nemanjiƒá) and the autocephalous church. In order to enter the world of Byzantine and European civilization of the Middle Ages, it was necessary for Serbia not only to have its independent state and independent Church but also to have its role in the general Christian culture of that time, especially participation in holiness, in a higher spiritual community, where the Serbian people was represented through \\"their [own] people\\". Its own literature was thus a necessary expression of social and national independence but at the same time integration in the spiritual ecumene of the Christian civilization through which it showed maturity and justified the political existence of the state itself on the world scale. On this basis, all of the specificnesses of the old Serbian literature developed, as well as its universal, global identity: specificities are expressed in the creation of general genres, mostly in the hagiographical literature, i.e. the so-called \\"ruler historiography\\"; far less pronounced in hymnography, in poetry, where the canons of Byzantine poetics are quite obvious. The role of founding the father of the independent Serbian literature is held by Saint Sava, the youngest son of Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja, founder and first Archbishop of the independent Serbian Church. With Saint Sava and others (namely Monk Simeon) there came works in the next century by prominent writers of the period, such as Domentijan and Atanasije, Grigorije II of Ras, Teodosije, Elder Grigorije, Antonije Baga≈°, Lazar the Hilandarian, Pachomius the Serb, Gabriel the Hilandarian, Constantine of Kostenets, Cyprian, Metropolitan of Kiev, Gregory Tsamblak, Isaija the Monk, Grigorije of Gornjak, Rajƒçin Sudiƒá, Jakov of Serres, Romylos of Vidin, Jovan the Serb of Kratovo, Gabriel of Lesnovo, Nicodemus of Tismana, Dimitar of Kratovo, Anonymous Athonite, Marko Peƒáki, and Demetrius Kantakouzenos, alongside important texts by women poets and writers, including Jefimija, Maria Angelina Doukaina Palaiologina, Princess Milica of Serbia, Saint Angelina of Serbia, Mara Brankoviƒá, Olivera Despina, Jelena Bal≈°iƒá, Helen of Anjou, Simonida, Katarina Brankoviƒá and others. The 1370s mark the beginning of the separation between Serbian Cyrillic and Latin alphabets as far as the two chancelleries in Ragusa are concerned. With the establishment of Manasija Monastery by Stefan Lazareviƒá who lived in the late 14th- and early 15th-century, many educated monks have gathered there. They fostered copying and literary work that by its excellence and production changed the history of the South Slavic literature and languages spreading its influence all over the Orthodox Balkans and Imperial Russia. One of the most famous scholars of the School of Re≈°ava was Constantine the Philosopher, an influential writer and biographer of the founder of the school, Stefan Lazareviƒá. Lazareviƒá was by far one of the most erudite people of his time and considering his views, interests, and achievements, he was a true representative of the Serbian Renaissance. From 1459https://books.google.ca/booksid=nvNkAAAAMAAJ&q;=serbian+renaissance+in+literature+and+the+arts&dq;=serbian+renaissance+in+literature+and+the+arts&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjsnOiGlLDkAhUFA6wKHYBZA94Q6AEIPTAD with the fall of the Smederevo up until the First Serbian Uprising in 1804, the Orthodox Christian monasteries were important centers that kept the Serbian culture alive and well during difficult and turbulent three and half- century occupation. The scriptorium of each monastery was a bastion of learning where illuminated manuscripts were being produced as well as great theological and scholastic works such as the Old Serbian Vita (hagiographies of Serbian kings and archbishops) also found in both Russian and Bulgarian literature. Throughout this time Serbs living under the Habsburgs, the Venetians and the lands of their Vlach co-religionists (Wallachia and Moldavia) were printing books, building monasteries, schools, hospitals, churches and kept the earliest of the Arts and Crafts movements busy painting icons and iconostases during the Renaissance‚Äîthe transition from the Middle Ages to modernity. The testaments to this are the many Serbian Orthodox monasteries, churches and libraries (institutions) found today in Hungary (R√°ckeve and Serbian Kovin Monastery), Romania (Hodo»ô-Bodrog, Bazja≈°, Sveti ƒêuraƒë, Bezdin, Zlatica, Ku≈°iƒá, Sveti Simeon, ≈†emljug, and others), Greece (Hilandar, Mount Athos and Meteora), Italy (Saint Spyridon), Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Northern Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania that speak of their rich art and literature. The growth of the Renaissance Period occurred with the arrival of Serbian and Bulgarian hagiographers, literati, and artists who had escaped from their native lands when these were either threatened or occupied by the Ottomans. Their creative activities in science and literature are personified in the extraordinary individuals such as Lazar the Serb, among the early Hilandarians to arrive in Moscow from Mount Athos; the Bulgarian- born Gregory Tsamblak who arrived from Serbia and eventually became the Metropolitan of Kiev; Pachomius the Serb, one of the representatives of a new ornamental style known as pletenie slova (word-braiding), and others. From the 1630s onward Kiev emerged as the leading center of East Slavic cultural life. Of great significance was the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy at the time. Later, Theophan Prokopovich would put his imprint on Russian Baroque literature that spread far and wide, particularly in Serbia. It was in the famed Kievan Academy in the latter part of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th century that young Serbian artists and teachers received their western education. Numerous authors of the Serbian Orthodox Church books who worked in the Raƒça monastery from the 15th- to 18th-century are named in Serbian literature ‚Äì \\"The Raƒçans\\"... Among these anonymous, monk-scribes identified by their first names, the most renown are the illuminator Hieromonk Hristifor Raƒçanin, Teodor Raƒçanin, Kiprijan Raƒçanin, ƒÜirjak Raƒçanin, Jerotej Raƒçanin, Simeon Raƒçanin, and Gavril Stefanoviƒá Vencloviƒá. These are well-known Serbian writers that are the link between literary men and women of the late medieval (Late Middle Ages) and Baroque periods in art, architecture, and literature in particular.

Meditative postures or meditation seats are the body positions or asanas, usually sitting but also sometimes standing or reclining, used to facilitate meditation. Best known in the Buddhist and Hindu traditions are the lotus and kneeling positions; other options include sitting on a chair, with the spine upright. Meditation is sometimes practiced while walking, such as kinhin, doing simple repetitive tasks, as in Zen samu, or work which encourages mindfulness. Postures in the Yoga Sutras Padmasana or Lotus pose is among the twelve meditation asanas named in the Bhasya commentary accompanying the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali describe yoga as having eight limbs, one being asana, the meditation seat. The sutras do not name any asanas, merely specifying the characteristics of a good asana, stating: The Sutras are embedded in the Bhasya commentary, which scholars including Philipp Maas now believe are by the same author; it names 12 seated meditation asanas, possibly all cross-legged, including Padmasana, Virasana, Bhadrasana (now called Baddha Konasana), and Svastikasana. Sitting on the ground A zafu meditation cushion, often used in Buddhist practice Sitting positions, often cross- legged, provide a stable base for meditation, and have been used for the purpose in Buddhism and Hinduism for many centuries. These include Padmasana (full lotus), Ardha Padmasana (half lotus), Siddhasana or Muktasana (sitting with the knees on the ground and the feet tucked in close to the body), and Sukhasana (any easy cross-legged position). Other possibilities are the kneeling postures Virasana (sitting between the heels) and Vajrasana (also called Burmese sitting) or Seiza (sitting on the heels). Another sitting posture, Baddha Konasana (Cobbler's Pose), is suitable for people who can sit with the feet together and both knees on the ground; B. K. S. Iyengar states that to meditate in this position, the palms should be held in prayer position over the chest, which demands some practice for balance.Seymour Ginsburg, describing Gurdjieff meditation, suggests that such compact positions help the meditator to \\"include the entire experience of ourself in our attention.\\" Buddhist monk seated in Seiza. H≈çk≈ç-ji temple, Japan The lotus position in particular can be extremely uncomfortable for Westerners who have not practised sitting cross-legged since early childhood. They may, in the words of the yoga and meditation teacher Anne Cushman, be practising \\"self-torture ... apparently believing that bruising your inner thigh with your ankle is crucial to spiritual awakening.\\" The pose can cause beginners knee pain and injury. Baddha Konasana is a safer alternative, provided the knees are not pushed down. A simple modern meditation stool, used to assist in sitting with the back upright and the legs crossed Cushman notes that since meditation is not a posture, no particular posture is required. All the same, she writes, a formal method is helpful, and the asana chosen needs to be stable and comfortable, as the Yoga Sutras state: on the one side, few people would wish to hold strenuous postures like Downward Dog for half an hour or more; on the other side, a restful posture like Savasana (Corpse Pose) might be comfortable but would more likely lead to sleep than meditation. The cross-legged postures are simple and stable, restful for the muscles, but active enough to keep the practitioner awake. The spinal column needs to be erect and in balance; this poise lets the muscles of the back relax, and this in turn allows the attention to be focussed on the breath. These conditions can be met by a variety of postures with or without support, whether a cross-legged posture such as Muktasana, a kneeling posture, or sitting on a chair with the back vertical and the feet on the ground. The traditional support for sitting meditation is a zafu cushion; this elevates the hips above the knees, allowing practitioners with stiff hips to have the spine straight and upright. Other postures Sukhothai, Thailand depicting monks during walking meditation. In various traditions people meditate in other postures. People who find sitting cross-legged uncomfortable can sit upright on a straight-backed chair, flat- footed and without back support, with the hands resting on the thighs, in what is sometimes called the Egyptian position. Orthodox Christians may practice the meditation of hesychasm sitting on a stool, as was recommended by Saint Gregory of Sinai. Theravada and Zen Buddhists sometimes vary their sitting meditation by meditating while walking, often very slowly so as to be mindful of each movement.

If RNase A is digested with subtilisin, a single peptide bond is cleaved, but the resulting two products remain weakly bound to each other and the protein, called ribonuclease S, remains active although each of the two products alone shows no enzymatic activity. The N-terminus of the original RNase A, also called S-peptide, consists of 20 amino acid residues, of which only the first 15 are required for ribonuclease activity. This 15 amino acids long peptide is called S15 or S-tag. The amino acid sequence of the S-tag is: Lys-Glu-Thr-Ala-Ala-Ala-Lys-Phe-Glu-Arg-Gln-His-Met-Asp-Ser. It is believed that the peptide with its abundance of charged and polar residues could improve solubility of proteins it is attached to. Moreover, the peptide alone is thought not to fold into a distinct structure. On DNA-level the S-tag can be attached to the N- or C-terminus of any protein.

Jae-mong Jeon, the junior prosecutor, also a patent attorney and a graduate of Seoul National University and Hanyang Law School, claims the sex was consensual, according to investigators.Senior prosecutor resigns over sex scandal Nov 23,2012 The incident has rocked the Korean Prosecutors Office to the core and resulted in a strong reprimand from the president and prompt resignation of the Chief Prosecutor. =G20 summit poster incident= There was an incident where a university instructor, Park Jeong-su, vandalized a G-20 promotional poster by drawing a rat before the 2010 G-20 Seoul summit. His prosecution by the SPO has exposed concerns that the SPO is politically leaned to serve the Lee Myung-bak government. =Impact= Baek Hye-ryun (Î∞±ÌòúÎ†®), the female district attorney of the Daegu District Public Prosecutor's Office, voluntarily resigned on November 21, 2011 as the SPO cannot officially maintain its political neutrality under the Lee Myung-bak government. The former chief secretary to late President Roh Moo-hyun, Moon Jae-in suggested that the SPO's resistance against reformations during the previous Participation Government, in which it also succeeded as the spearhead of the right-wing Lee Myung-bak government, eventually contributed to the unjust investigations against Roh in 2009. =Abuse of citizens= On October 26, 2011, the Seoul Central District Court appealed against the SPO for continuing an abusive investigation of a child sex abuse case; demanded the government to compensate the family members of the case in question.

The three major categories of ambient pressure underwater breathing apparatus are: *Open circuit scuba, where the diver carries the gas supply, and exhaled gas is exhausted to the environment *Rebreather scuba, where the diver carried the gas supply, and exhaled gas is recycled for further use, and *Surface supplied diving equipment, where the gas supply is provided from the surface through a diver's umbilical Atmospheric pressure underwater breathing apparatus is also used in the form of armoured atmospheric diving suits, which maintain an internal pressure approximating surface pressure.  Open circuit scuba  Recreational scuba diver A scuba set is any breathing apparatus that is carried entirely by an underwater diver and provides the diver with breathing gas at the ambient pressure. Although strictly speaking the scuba set is only the diving equipment which is required for providing breathing gas to the diver, general usage includes the harness by which it is carried, and those accessories which are integral parts of the harness and breathing apparatus assembly, such as a jacket or wing style buoyancy compensator and instruments mounted in a combined housing with the pressure gauge. In open-circuit demand scuba, the diver expels exhaled air to the environment, and requires each breath be delivered on demand by a diving regulator, which reduces the pressure from the storage cylinder. The breathing air is supplied through a demand valve when the diver reduces the pressure in the demand valve during inhalation.  Rebreather scuba  2nd Reconnaissance Battalion combat diver training with the Draeger LAR V rebreather A Diving rebreather recirculates the breathing gas already used by the diver after replacing oxygen used by the diver and removing the carbon dioxide metabolic product. Rebreather diving is used by recreational, military and scientific divers in applications where it has advantages over open circuit scuba, and surface supply of breathing gas is impracticable. The main advantages of rebreather diving are extended gas endurance, and lack of bubbles. Rebreathers are generally used for scuba applications, but are also occasionally used for bailout systems for surface supplied diving. Rebreathers are more complex to use than open circuit scuba, and have more potential points of failure, so acceptably safe use requires a greater level of skill, attention and situational awareness, which is usually derived from understanding the systems, diligent maintenance and overlearning the practical skills of operation and fault recovery.  Surface-supplied diving equipment  Surface- supplied commercial diving equipment on display at a trade show The essential aspect of surface-supplied diving is that breathing gas is supplied from the surface, either from a specialized diving compressor, high-pressure cylinders, or both. In commercial and military surface-supplied diving, a backup source of breathing gas should always be present in case the primary supply fails. The diver may also wear a cylinder called a \\"bail-out bottle,\\" which can provide self-contained breathing gas in an emergency. Thus, the surface- supplied diver is much less likely to have an \\"out-of-air\\" emergency than a scuba diver as there are normally two alternative air sources available. Surface-supplied diving equipment usually includes communication capability with the surface, which adds to the safety and efficiency of the working diver. Surface supplied diving includes diving using an umbilical with gas supply hose, lifeline strength member and communications cable, using a helmet or full-face mask, and diving with a simple air line, also known as hookah equipment.  Atmospheric diving suits  The Newtsuit has fully articulated, rotary joints in the arms and legs. These provide great mobility, while remaining largely unaffected by high pressures. An atmospheric diving suit (ADS) is a small one-person articulated anthropomorphic submersible which resembles a suit of armour, with elaborate pressure joints to allow articulation while maintaining an internal pressure of one atmosphere. Atmospheric diving suits can be used for very deep dives of up to for many hours, and eliminate the majority of significant physiological dangers associated with deep diving; the occupant need not decompress, there is no need for special gas mixtures, nor is there danger of decompression sickness or nitrogen narcosis. Divers do not even need to be skilled swimmers.

Design The Avia-Tor is a conventionally arranged single engine high wing light aircraft, seating two side-by-side. It was designed as a sport machine, with applications as a basic trainer, agricultural sprayer, patroller and air photographer. It has constant chord wings built around two wooden spars with fibreglass ribs and synthetic fabric covering. They are braced from the lower fuselage with V-struts on each side, assisted by further intermediate bracing. Three position (0¬∞, 10¬∞ and 40¬∞) flaps are fitted. The square sided fuselage has a stainless steel truss structure and is fabric covered apart from the glass fibre engine cowling and cabin roof. The two upward hinged cabin doors are entirely transparent blisters for optimum visibility. The empennage is formed from steel tubes with fibreglass ribs, all fabric covered. The tailplane is wire braced from above to the fin with a pair of wires on each side and similarly below to the lower fuselage. The elevators are mass balanced and the port side one has a trim tab. The rudder also has a tab. Wings and tailplane can be easily folded for transport.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 85. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. The Avia-Tor normally uses a fixed tricycle undercarriage, though floats or skis are options. Each mainwheel is supported by a V-pair of struts joined to the lower fuselage longerons and with a half-axle from wheel to the central fuselage. A MVEN KS-500-2 Cobra ballistic parachute recovery system is standard. Development The first prototype flew in 2002 and was followed by four more T-10 pre-production aircraft. These were followed by a batch of production T-10M machines for purchase as complete aircraft. The production of kits may follow. The T-10M has some changes to undercarriage and fin, plus a change of engine. The main gear sprung element has been moved from the half-axle to the rearward V strut and the early castoring nosewheel replaced with a steerable system with a simpler single leg. The fin of the T-10M is more angular and narrower than that of the T-10 and incorporates a triangular fillet. The T-10s are powered by 60 kW (80 hp) Jabiru 2200s, the T-10Ms by 74 kW (100 hp) Rotax 912S flat four engines.

Background  The East India Company‚ÄìTravancore Subsidiary Alliance Treaty of 1795 established a subsidiary alliance between the British East India Company and the Kingdom of Travancore. Under the treaty, the Company was to maintain a subsidiary military force in or near Travancore to defensively aid the kingdom from foreign powers, and the maintenance costs would be paid by the government of Travancore. The Company intervened during the Mysorean invasion on behalf of its ally Travancore in 1789, and defeated Mysore in the Third Anglo-Mysore War. Pages 389-400, The Travancore State Manual, V.

Shungoony Menon, 1878, published by Higginbotham and Co, Madras Following the death of the Maharajah Dharma Raja, the next ruler Balarama Varma was weak and his ministers started having a greater say in the running of the country and became the de facto rulers of the state.page 337, A survey of Kerala History, Prof. A Sreedhara Menon, published by S.viswananthan Printers and Publishers, Madras, 1996 Following a revolt by a section of the Tranvancorean army and an attempt on the life of the Dalawa Velu Thampi in 1804, the Company's troops, at the behest of the Dalawa himself, initially protected the Dalawa and then later, put down the revolt. A further treaty in July 1805 replaced Travancore's military obligations with an additional subsidy of 401,655 rupees and a financial obligation to bear a proportion of any further costs incurred in defending the state. In 1806, the Maharaja of Travancore did not have the funds to pay the additional subsidy in full. The Company remitted half of the subsidy for two years, so that the king could make military budget cuts to raise the funds to pay it in full afterwards. In 1807, the king still lacked the funds to pay the subsidy in full, requested permanent remission of half of the subsidy, and also requested that future payments . The British Resident at Travancore, Lieutenant Colonel Colin Macaulay, insisted on prompt payment of the arrears, which amounted to 662,669 rupees, and demanded military reduction and the disbandment Travancore's Carnatic Brigade to raise the money. The king insisted on retaining the corps. The Company intended to discharge the unremitted half of the subsidy, and the entirety of it from 1807. Dalawa Velu Thampi claimed that the requirement of the additional subsidy was a product of extortion. In 1808, he and the king asked for the additional subsidy to be relinquished entirely. Resident Macaulay attributed the government's refusal to pay the subsidy by making military cuts to Dalawa Velu Thampi, and said that the king was satisfied with the subsidiary arrangements. After the dalawa received a letter from Governor George Barlow of Madras, he appeared happy, apologised to the resident for delaying the payment of the subsidy, and arranged for the payment to be made in installments. However, when the payments stopped after 60,000 rupees, with over 800,000 still unpaid, the resident suggested to the king that Velu Thampi be replaced as the Dalawa of Travancore. The king in turn requested the Madras Presidency to replace Macaulay as the Resident of Travancore. The Dalawa of Cochin, Paliath Achan, harboured discontent for Macaulay over the resident's friendship with his sworn enemy, Kunhikrishna Menon of Nadavarambu, the finance minister of Cochin. He suggested to Velu Thampi that the resident be assassinated by military force. Velu Thampi accepted and prepared for battle, organising and training a group of Travancori sepoys. He held secret meetings with the Americans, the Calicutites and the French, the latter of whom gave assurances of military support from Mauritius, including 500 artillerymen to land on the Malabar coast in January 1809.  Course  On 18 December 1808, open rebellion broke out in Travancore and Cochin. At midnight, the Resident's house in Cochin was stormed, though Colonel Macaulay and Kunhikrishana Menon managed to escape. The British garrison in Cochin, under Lieutenant Colonel John Chalmers, found itself under attack by thousands of militia as well as the state forces of Travancore. Reinforcements. including the 1st Battalion 17th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry (1/17th MNI) were dispatched from Madras and arrived in Cochin in early January 1809. On 19 January 1809, a large force of rebels attacked the town of Cochin, which was being defended by six companies of 1/17th MNI and fifty men of the 12th Regiment of Foot under the command of Major W. H. Hewitt of 1/17th MNI. Major Hewitt and his men repulsed the attack after a gallant and skilful defence. In a dispatch to the Resident, Major Hewitt described the action: > ... the detachment HM's 12th Regiment, and the six companies 1st Battalion > 17th Regiment under my command, were attacked by three columns of the enemy > on three different points about 6 o‚Äôclock this morning, and after a very > severe engagement of three hours, we repulsed them on all sides with > considerable slaughter, and captured their two guns ... from what I could > observe in the field of action, the enemy's forces appeared about 3000 > excellent disciplined troops, but from what I can collect from report, they > amounted to much more. In a second dispatch, Hewitt gave more details of the action: > ... the enemy advanced along the glaces in sub-divisions in most perfect > order, with a six pounder in front of their centre ... a four pounder > flanking us ... I drew my party up under cover of a small part of the > glaces, and at the distance of thirty paces gave them a volley of musketry, > and charged them with the bayonet, they gave us two rounds from the gun, > some from their fire locks and ran away. This disposed off the first column. > The other two columns captured the fort, and ... I despatched Captain Jones > with a company to take them on their right flank, (which he did with great > value) ... they ran in all directions ... their loss amounts in killed and > wounded to about 300 men. 290px The casualties of 1/17th MNI were ten privates killed and 45 wounded in addition to Captain John Reid, who later died of his wounds. For the gallant defence, the battalion was later awarded the Battle Honour of \\"Cochin\\". The British troops defeated the rebels in another battle at Quilon. In the meantime, following Thampi's Kundara Proclamation on 11 January 1809, some British civilians and their native supporters were executed by the rebels in Travancore. In mid-January, the British assembled a force of 3000 in the south of Travancore to relieve pressure on Lieutenant Colonel Chalmers‚Äô force and under Colonel St. Leger, it entered Travancore via the Aramboly Pass and occupied the fortress there. On 19 February 1809, the strategic forts of Udayagiri and Padmanabhapuram fell to the British. The army marched to Trivandrum, the capital of Travancore and camped at the suburb of Pappanamcode, while another force entered Cochin and chased away the remaining rebels. The Rajas of both the states had not openly supported the rebels and at these turn of events, the Maharaja of Travancore defected to the East India company and appointed a new Dalawa. Following a severe defeat at Cochin, Paliath Achan, the Dalawa of Cochin, defected from the anti-British alliance on 27 February 1809. The Maharajah issued an order for the arrest of Velu Thampi, who was run to the ground by the Maharajah's soldiers at Mannadi. Velu Thampi committed suicide to avoid capture and with his death the rebellion ended.

John Lennon Peace Monument Vigil  John Lennon Peace Monument Vigil ‚Äì 8 December 2010Fans of John Lennon and The Beatles made their way to Liverpool on 8 December 2010 to mark the 30th anniversary of John Lennon's death with a candlelit vigil that took place at the city's European Peace Monument dedicated to John. Those attending the 2010 unveiling of the monument were led in song on the occasion by local singers and musicians. Since being unveiled by Julian and Cynthia Lennon on Lennon's birth date, 9 October, the peace monument has established itself as a popular focal point for visitors to The Beatles home city looking to celebrate Lennon's life and message of peace through his music. Jerry Goldman, director of The Beatles Story, was instrumental in having the monument erected in Liverpool. He said, \\"although the European Peace Monument has only been on public display for just over a month it's already taken on a global significance of its own. People from all over the world are coming to the city to pay their respects and consider Lennon's message of peace through his music.\\"  References   External links  * www.beatlesstory.com * laurenvoiers.com * artinmetalusa.com * www.theglobalpeaceinitiative.com * www.whitefeatherfoundation.com * Unveiling of Peace & Harmony, European Peace Monument ‚Äì Dedicated to John Lennon * John Lennon European Peace Monument Liverpool * BBC coverage of the European Peace Monument unveiling * John Lennon Peace Vigil ‚Äì Liverpool, December 8th, 2010 Category:Monuments and memorials to John Lennon Category:Buildings and structures in Liverpool Category:Buildings and structures completed in 2010 Category:Peace monuments and memorials Category:Monuments and memorials in Liverpool ","title":"John Lennon Peace Monument"},{"id":"29635567","text":"A barrage in Rockhampton, Australia Jobra Barrage in Cuttack, India A barrage is a type of low-head, diversion dam which consists of a number of large gates that can be opened or closed to control the amount of water passing through. This allows the structure to regulate and stabilize river water elevation upstream for use in irrigation and other systems. The gates are set between flanking piers which are responsible for supporting the water load of the pool created. The term barrage is borrowed from the French word \\"barrer\\" meaning \\"to bar\\".  Dam construction  picture of barrage dam Dams are made around the world for many different reasons and have a variety of uses. There is a lot to consider when constructing a new dam. The location must be inspected, the purpose of the dam has to pass certain criteria and the effects of possibly removing the dam must also be taken into account. Barrage dams in specific are a form of dam that has a series of gates that control the amount of water passing through it. A barrage dam can be used to divert water for irrigation needs or limit the amount of water down-stream. In most cases, a barrage dam is built near the mouth of the river. The site of dam construction needs to be thoroughly investigated to insure that the foundation is strong enough to support the dam and has low possibility of failing. When dams are created, they are given a safety rating depending on the type of dam, location, and the possible effects in case of failure. The ratings are from one to five, five having the highest danger rating. The rating of five would be given to dams built with a town or city downstream that would have higher possibility of injury to people in the case of dam failure. New designs have been made that are able to sustain greater amounts of water. An improved wedge-shaped block technology was developed by Rafael Moran and Miguel Toledo. The new structure is able to withstand severe flooding and use less materials, reducing the production cost. Not only could this design save money, but it also can save lives and would increase the safety rating.  Environmental impacts  Dam construction comes with several impacts that can affect the economy and the environment. In specific, there are several ways in which the environment can be affected from dam construction. Species richness is usually measured to determine the effect of a dam on the ecosystems surrounding dams. To observe the species richness, scientists collect data on the fish and animal populations before and after construction of the dam. With that data, they are able to see how the population size increased or decreased. In some cases, it was found that the species richness was less downstream from a dam compared to further upstream. Inhibiting the volume of water was shown to be detrimental to species diversity and richness. Also, at the entrance of dams, there is less nutrients due to the high-water flow reducing the ecosystems reproduction standard. Along with the species richness, plankton diversity can be an indicator of the ecosystems ability to handle the newly built dam. It has been shown that dams can have an effect on the migration of fish leading to less reproduction. There are many small factors that can have relatively large impacts that effect the river ecosystems, such as the species richness, volume of water and nutrient levels. Different experiments have been done that look into each of these individually and were able to determine why some dams cause such impacts. While there is substantial evidence and case studies that point to dam construction having environmental impacts, there are also studies that show less damage than expected. Looking at plankton near some dams has shown that plankton are able to continue to live although changes to their habitats. Changes such as the pH levels near dams have been recorded and plankton were minimally affected. Other species, however, such as trout, are more affected due to the physical dam inhibiting their migration and reproduction paths. Barrage dams control the amount of water going through them, leading to differences in the amount of water up and downstream from the dam. This discrepancy has different effects on different species native to the area. While there can be reduced flow downstream, there can also be problems upstream. Dams can have buildup of pressure that fish are not accustomed to and they migrate further upstream causing that part of the river to have reduced population sizes. Although there are environmental impacts that come with building new dams, there are also many economies that benefit from a dam. Without dams, it would be much harder to farm and grow livestock. The irrigation technology that comes with building a dam can exceed the risk factor.  Terminology  According to the World Commission on Dams, a key difference between a barrage and a dam is that a dam is built for water storage in a reservoir, which raises the level of water significantly. A barrage is built for diverting water, and raises the water level by only a few feet. The latter is generally built on flat terrain across wide, often meandering rivers. Similar distinctions are used in Egypt, where it is noted: \\"In this system a \\"dam\\" is a structure that forms a reservoir for the storage of water during the annual flood period of the Nile in order to supplement the natural flow of the river during the low-water period; a \\"barrage\\" merely raises the river or canal level, when necessary, to the height required for adequate flow into the canals that take off above it.Raye R. Platt, Mohammed Bahy Hefny, Egypt: A Compendium, p.198, American Geographical Society, 1958. Retrieved 2014-12-03 Barrages are usually larger than the headworks of irrigation and navigation canals, with which they are associated. Barrages that are commonly used to dam a tidal lagoon or estuary as a method to capture tidal power from tidal inflows are known as tidal barrages.  Etymology  The English usage of the term barrage originates from the Delta Barrage across the Nile-branches north of Cairo, built between 1833 and 1862 by the French Linant de Bellefonds and Eug√®ne Mougel employed in the Egyptian Public Works Department, with assistance from Barth√©lemy Prosper Enfantin, and with the blessing of the Egyptian Viceroy of the Ottoman Empire, Muhammad Ali. When the British, after 1882, had to look after these structures generally referred to as barrages, they adopted the term in their language and continued to use it for similar structures built by themselves across the Nile (Zefta Barrage and Assiut Barrage both completed in 1902). Since the British in the Egyptian Public Works Department kept close relations to their counterparts in British India, the term barrages made its way to present day India and Pakistan as well as to the Middle East, and thus generally into English.

Prior to October 2010, it was a United States Air Force installation, and prior to 1995, it was an active military airfield known as Sembach Air Base (former ICAO ETAS, IATA SEX). It now belongs to U.S. Army Garrison Rheinland-Pfalz. During the Cold War (1950‚Äì1993), Sembach Air Base housed a variety of USAF Tactical Reconnaissance, Close Air Support and Tactical Air Control units as a front line NATO air base. Current status Sembach serves a population of about 2,000. On 1 October 2010, the US Air Force handed over control of Sembach Annex to the US Army, which renamed the site Sembach Kaserne. Sembach Kaserne is a part of the Kaiserslautern Military Community (KMC). It is used for housing American Army military personnel. The first US Army unit to locate on the Kaserne was the 230th Military Police Company \\"Warmasters\\", which has since cased it's colors.Multiple other units and activities have followed as the US Army consolidates it's footprint in Germany through the closing of other garrisons. The housing developments and dormitories were declared condemned by the Air Force in 2007 and no longer occupied by any Air Force personnel. The Army has made significant improvements to the post and now houses soldiers in the barracks buildings. The facility has a commissary, bowling alley, club, elementary/middle school, fire station, four baseball/softball fields and a football field. Sembach is the home of the United States Army's 95th Military Police Battalion, 18th Military Police Brigade, the 30th Medical Command , and the 786th Security Forces Squadron regional training center. Although congress never reviewed or approved of this new Army base, the money being spent in its renovations will provide soldiers stationed in the area with adequate living conditions and reduce the need for soldiers to acquire housing on the economy in the surrounding area. The purpose of opening this installation is to facilitate the consolidation and closure of several other US Army posts throughout Germany.

Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History. =Origins= Sembach's origins date back to 1919 after World War I when French occupation troops used the eastern half of the present flightline as an airfield. The French facilities consisted of 10 sheet-iron barracks and 26 wooden hangars with canvas coverings. As part of the general withdrawal of French occupation forces from the left bank of the Rhine in 1930, the French abandoned the airfield on June 15, 1930. After the French withdrawal, the land was returned to farmers and used as a hayfield. In 1939, the German Luftwaffe ordered that the area be reserved for use as a fighter base. Because of the brevity of the French campaign in the first year of the Second World War, the area was returned to the farmers to be used as a pasture in June 1940. =NATO Acquisition= In 1950, as a result of the Cold War threat of the Soviet Union, the United States was rapidly expanding its air forces, announcing an increase in the number of combat wings from 48 in 1950 to 95 by June 1952. In April 1951, German surveyors visited the area in the company of French officers. The local farmers protested the construction of a hard-surface airfield which would entail the loss of much of their land, and they demonstrated in Mainz, the capital of the Rhineland- Palatinate. Despite this vigorous opposition, the French occupational authorities began the construction of a modern airfield at the end of June 1951. Many workers were brought in to build the new base, and the village of Sembach took on the character of a boomtown. Construction continued around the clock through the use of nighttime illumination. The pouring of the 8,500-foot concrete runway was begun early in September 1951 and was finished by the end of the month. The taxiways were completed by the close of the year. Although the Air Base was constructed in the French Zone of Occupation under French direction, it was built to be used by NATO forces and was, moreover, intended to be an American Air Base from the beginning. On 1 September 1951, U.S. authorities officially took over the construction site from the French and named it Sembach Air Auxiliary Field. During the remainder of the winter, the control tower, hangars, repair shops and other buildings were built along the taxiway. With the building of munitions bunkers to the east of the flightline and a road connecting the taxiway to the B-40 in April 1952, the construction of the flightline area was finished. In the middle of April 1952, the residents of Sembach learned that the land to the north of the now completed flightline was to be used for the construction of multi-story barracks and office buildings. On April 22, officials began to survey the land that was to be built upon. The farmers joined forces and forcibly hindered the surveyors, injuring one of them. On April 23, 1952, the Chief of the State Chancellery personally visited Sembach and promised the farmers that he would do all that he could to protect their rights. The Sembach farmers were not convinced, and on 28 April, they again denied the surveyors entrance to their fields. Despite these efforts, the land was successfully surveyed in August 1952. In September, the Minister President of the Rhineland-Palatinate announced that the government had offered an alternative to the site for the planned construction. Shortly afterward, the French occupation authorities agreed to build on the Heuberg, a sandy area of comparatively little agricultural value located approximately a mile from the flightline. With this announcement, and everyone being satisfied, Sembach became a center of activity once more, and construction of the administrative area of the base began in October 1952. Over 2500 workers worked day and night operating bulldozers, dump trucks and cement haulers. The barracks and administrative buildings were completed in the spring of 1953. =USAF use= 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing US Air Force Europe shield The American flag first flew at Sembach Air Base on 8 July 1953. On that day, at 1045 hours, the first of 18 RB-26 Invader aircraft belonging to the 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing (TRW) landed on the new flightline, arriving from Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina. With the arrival of the 66th TRW, the installation was renamed Sembach Air Base. Major General B. C. Struther, commander of Twelfth Air Force, welcomed the Wing. The Wing Commander landed at 1509 hours in a T-33, bringing the remainder of the wing's aircraft with him: 32 RF-80 Shooting Stars and 4 additional T-33s.

All of these aircraft were sold to the German Air Force. 17011 was later sold to the Greek Air Force and 7381 to the Italian Air Force. 17011 is now on permanent display at the Hellenic AF Museum, Dekelia AB, Athens. Newly arrived Douglas RB-66B-DL Destroyer serial 54-0511 of the 30th TRS, 1957 A TM-76A (MGM-13A) Mace Missile The 66th TRW had three operational squadrons: the 30th, 302d and 303d TRS. The 30th TRS flew the RB-26, while the 302d and 303d flew the RF-80A. The third and final phase of construction at Sembach Air Base was conducted in the summer of 1954 when the housing area was built. On 30 November 1954, the 30th TRS received the first Martin RB-57A Canberra, to replace its World War II vintage RB-26 Invaders. In August 1955, the 302d and 303d TRS started to receive the Republic RF-84F Thunderflash. On 1 January 1957 a fourth squadron, the 19th TRS was transferred from the 47th Bombardment Wing (SAC) at RAF Sculthorpe to the 66th TRW. The 47th TRS flew the RB-45C Tornado, however the squadron remained at Sculthrope and did not physically transfer its assets to Sembach. At Sculthorpe, the 19th TRS transitioned to the RB-66 aircraft. In February 1957, the RB-57s of the 30th TFS at Sembach were also being replaced by the Douglas RB-66 Destroyer. The heavier RB-66s however, did not land well on Sembach's runway, and the 30th TRS was deployed to Landstuhl AB (now Ramstein AB) for their operations. As 1957 progressed USAFE HQ decided to reorganizes its tactical reconnaissance assets. Both the 66th TRW and the 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Spangdahlem Air Base were flying dissimilar types of aircraft: the RF-84F and the RB-66. This was counterproductive not only in terms of operational efficiency, but also in terms of maintenance and supply. On 6 December 1957 HQ, USAFE transferred the 19th and 30th TRS and their RB-66s to the 10th TRW. In return the 32d and 38th TFS at Phalsbourg AB, France were transferred from the 10th TRW which made the 66th TRW a four-squadron RF-84 wing. However, due to space restrictions at Sembach, the 32d and 38th would remain in France, as a separate detachment of the 66th. In January 1958, it was announced that the 66th TRW would transition to the RF-101 Voodoo. In addition, the poor flying weather of the German winter was causing an excessive amount of operational delays due to the inclement weather. The 66th was directed to utilise Nouasseur AB, Morocco to its limits in detachments of USAFE aircraft. At Nouasseur all training missions were accomplished as required. The very favourable North African weather provided the ideal environment in which new pilots could be transitioned on to the squadron aircraft in the minimum of time. In addition, the 66th TRW used Nouasseur to transition all its pilots onto the RF-101c Aircraft. In July 1958, the 66th TRW, was transferred from Sembach to Laon Air Base, France. This move was in accordance with USAFEs plan to realign the posture of various bases in anticipation of the 66th's pending aircraft conversion to the RF-101. Another reason for the move to France was the unsuitability of Sembach's runway, which was barely adequate for the RF-84, but absolutely unsuitable for the higher performance RF-101 aircraft. 38th Tactical Missile Wing After the departure of the 66th, Sembach was taken over by the 7127th Support Group in June 1958 as a 'placeholder' unit. The 38th Tactical Missile Wing, originally activated at Hahn Air Base, Germany, 18 June 1958, assumed its new headquarters at Sembach Air Base, Germany, including all supporting squadrons, including the 38th TMW Hospital, on 29 August 1959, becoming the first operational missile base in the US Air Force. The 38th TMW was originally composed of three Tactical Missile groups, the 585th Tactical Missile Group at Bitburg AB, the 586th Tactical Missile Group at Hahn AB, and the 587th Tactical Missile Group at Sembach AB, in addition to a headquarters unit. The Tactical Missile Groups were inactivated 25 September 1962 and the 38th TMW assumed direct control of all squadrons. The 38th TMW was composed of launch and maintenance squadrons at detached and remote installations at Sembach, Hahn, and Bitburg Air Bases in Germany, in addition to being the host wing at Sembach. The 38th Tactical Missile Wing had the distinction of maintaining two separate weapons systems, not once, but twice. First by bringing the TM-76 Mace \\"A\\" operational in August, 1959, while maintaining the TM-61C Matador combat ready until September 1962. Later, the Mace \\"A\\" later re-numbered to MGM-13A, remained operational until 1966, concurrently with the hard site TM-76 Mace \\"B\\", brought operational in June, 1964 at Bitburg with the 71st TMS. The 38th TMW won the U.S. Air Force Outstanding Unit Award twice during its activation at Sembach. The 38th TMW inactivated in September 1966, and its missiles were returned to the United States. The 2d Mobile Communications Group moved to Sembach Air Base in November 1966 from Toul-Rousieres Air Base, France after the French withdrawal from NATO's integrated military force structure. The 603d Air Base Wing was activated after the departure of the 38th to administer Sembach Air Base and to perform a mission of support for the 601st Tactical Control Group (TCG) and the 7th Air Commando Squadron. The 601st TCG had been stationed at Sembach Air Base since its activation on 15 February 1965. The 7th Air Commando Squadron had moved to Sembach from Eglin Air Force Base, Florida in March 1964 and left Sembach in 1968. 601st Tactical Air Control Wing Reforger '82. A 43rd Electronic Combat Squadron EC-130H Compass Call over Sembach, 1987. The 601st Tactical Air Control Wing (TCW) was activated on 1 July 1968, absorbing the mission of the 603rd ABW. The 601st CSG assumed the new wing's secondary mission of operating the base and of performing the base support functions except for the brief two-year period (1973‚Äì75) when the 7400th Air Base Group ran the base, until 1 June 1985. At this time, the 601st underwent major wing reorganization. The then current 601 TCW structure was divided into the 65th Air Division Staff with two subordinate wings, the 66th Electronic Combat Wing and the new 601st Tactical Control Wing. As such, the newly created 66th ECW was assigned host wing responsibilities previously held by the 601st TCW. In any event, the 601st CSG was redesignated the 66th CSG with responsibilities of operating the base and providing the base support function for both the 66th ECW and the 601st TCW. Headquarters Seventeenth Air Force was moved to Sembach AB on 5 October 1971 from Ramstein Air Base. In 1973, the 601st was notified of its relocation to Wiesbaden AB, however on 8 August 1975, under Project Creek Swap, the Wing was notified it would again have to pack its bags and move back to Sembach. In January 1976, the 601st began its move en masse back to Sembach Air Base, and by 31 March 1976, the move back to Sembach was complete. At various times, the 66th's air defense mission not only included the most modern air control radar systems available, but also the O-2 Skymaster and OV-10 Bronco aircraft for forward air control purposes and CH-53 helicopters for mobility support. An A-10 Thunderbolt II forward operating location was established when Det 1, 81st Tactical Fighter Wing was activated on 1 September 1978 from RAF Bentwaters, UK. Revetments and a dozen hardened aircraft shelters were built and A-10 operations began in May 1979. The OV-10As were sent back to the United States in 1984, and the helicopters were transferred to special operations units in 1988. The 601st wide range of communications, which had its beginnings in World War II, was heavily tasked in support of operations during Operation Desert Storm and Operation Provide Comfort, starting with the early buildup in the Persian Gulf during August 1990. One item of communications-electronic equipment that was used in the many deployments and exercises throughout central and northern Europe was the AN/TRC-97A Radio Set, which was maintained by Wideband Maintenance Equipment Repairmen. This set was very versatile because it provided line of sight, point to point communications in the German countryside. The TRC-97 was widely used over a period of many years, but it was eventually replaced by a digital, less maintenance intensive, AN/TRC-170 Radio Set. The 601st air control units became an Operations Group in March 1992 that resulted in the formation of the 601st Support Wing. In 1993, more than half the 601st air control assets deployed to Italy in support of Operation Deny Flight, the United Nations sponsored operations that established a no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Operations Group was inactivated in October 1993, when the Support Wing was redesignated as the 601st Air Base Wing. At the time, the wing was responsible for over 40 geographically separated units in combination with over 200 people deployed to more than a dozen locations worldwide. In 1995, the Sembach flightline was returned to German control. The site became an annex of Ramstein Air Base and was renamed Sembach Annex. In the summer of 1998, the German government started to dismantle the airfield runway, returning the ownership of the airfield area to local governments. The remaining facilities of Sembach AB are situated 2 miles away from the former airfield, with only a few tenant units remaining. =66th Electronic Combat Wing= EC-130H from 43rd ECS over Sembach AB in 1987 On 1 June 1985, the 66th was reactivated again at Sembach AB, West Germany as the 66th Electronic Combat Wing. The 66th ECW trained (43d ECS) Lockheed EC-130 Hercules aircrews at Sembach in the Compass Call mission; administratively controlled (42d ECS) General Dynamics/Grumman EF-111A Raven aircrews based at RAF Upper Heyford, England, and acted as a command and control coordination function for the 52nd FW F-4G & F-16C/D Wild Weasel SAM suppression (SEAD) mission. The 66th provided tactical and electronic combat operations during Operation Desert Storm. The 66th ECW was inactivated on 31 March 1992. =6914th and 6918th Electronic Security Squadron (ESS)= On July 19, 1985, U.S. Air Forces, Europe (USAFE) accepted and approved the USAFSS proposal to combine the mobile 6913 ESS and 6918 ESS (located at Sembach) into the 6914th ESS and move the combined unit to the Mehlingen Annex (near Sembach, Germany). On 1 October 1986, the 6918 ESS set up at the Mehlingen Annex and became the 6914 ESS. The 6913th and then the 6914th maintained and operated the mobile Beechcraft RC-12 Guardrail system.http://misawa.angryhosting.com/download/a-continuing- legacy-1948-2000.pdfhttps://www.25af.af.mil/Portals/100/Documents/AFD-150310-024.pdf?ver=2016https://archive.org/stream/CIADocuments/CIA-517_djvu.txt Site deactivation date is unknown. =6919th Electronic Security Squadron (ESS)= On 28 March 1986, the USAFE Vice Commander (CV), Major General Martin approved 6919 ESS as the designator for the new ESC COMPASS CALL [mission crew] squadron, and on the same day, USAFE transferred 109 manpower billets to ESC effective 1 October 1986. USAFE agreed to provide ESC all facilities and equipment required to support the USAFE Compass Call mission. The 6919 ESS was activated at Sembach AB, Germany, on 1 October 1986. The 6919th ESS, Sembach, Air Base, Germany, began supporting EC-130 Compass Call operations in late 1986. With the 43rd ECS piloting the aircraft, the 6919th provided electronic combat operations during Operation Desert Storm. On 25 April 1991, the 6919 ESS flew its last operational mission, closing out another chapter in the proud history of ESC airborne operations.http://misawa.angryhosting.com/download/a-continuing- legacy-1948-2000.pdf The 6919 ESS was inactivated on 21 May 1991.

Forbes Watson (from NY public library) The Coorg War was fought between the British East India Company and the State of Coorg in 1834. Defiance of the Raja of Coorg (Chikka Virarajendra), a small state in South India, led to a short but bloody campaign in 1834. In February 1834, a force of 7000 was assembled under the command of Brigadier General Lindsay to commence operations against the Raja, who had begun hostilities against the British. Due to the poor state of roads, the force was divided into four columns, which were to enter Coorg from different directions and converge on the capital of Mercara. On 11 March, the Northern Division under the command of Colonel Gilbert Waugh entered the territory of Coorg and on 3 April, the leading troops made contact with the enemy. At noon, the advanced guard arrived in front of the fortified position of Soamwar Pettah (now called Somwarpet). The force launched an attack on the position but was forced to retreat after a severe mauling. The leader of the Coorg resistance at was 'Madanta' (Mathanda) Appachu. Similar fate was suffered by another column. Two divisions entered Mercara on 6 April, bringing an end to the hostilities. Colonel Lindsay had that morning (6 April) hoisted the British ensign on the ramparts of Madikeri (Mercara) Fort. Some of the British officers who served in the Coorg campaign against the Coorgs and survived were Colin Mackenzie and William Anson McCleverty.

He was a Robert Fulton Fellow at Harvard University in 2004, a DAAD fellow in Berlin in 2006 and a resident at the Goethe Institut in Salvador da Bahia in 2018.  Works  In 2004, De Rooij began to include works of other artists in his own artworks. For example, his film Mandarin Ducks (2005) was shown at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam in 2005 within the context of objects and artworks from the museum's collection.De Rijke / De Rooij - Mandarin Ducks (Dutch Pavilion Biennale 2005) In 2007, De Rooij made two installations in which he included the work of artists Isa Genzken, Keren Cytter and designer Fong Leng: one at Galerie Chantal Crousel in Paris named \\"The Floating Feather\\",Galerie Chantal Crousel and one at Galerie Daniel Buchholz in Cologne named \\"Birds in a Park\\".Galerie Daniel Buchholz His 2009 installation \\"Birds\\" was shown at Cubitt Artists in London and included, among others, works by Dutch artist Vincent Vulsma. In 2010, De Rooij showed an installation titled Intolerance at the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin, combining 18 works by Dutch animalier painter Melchior d'Hondecoeter with a selection of 18th-century Hawaiian featherwork. The three-fold publication includes the first substantial monograph on the work of d‚ÄôHondecoeter to date, and a catalogue raisonn√© of all capes, helmets and god-images that are part of the category known as Hawaiian featherwork written by Adrienne Kaeppler.

Since 2002, De Rooij has been making a series of sculptures made of flowers, the Bouquets.  Reception  Describing the work of De Rijke / De Rooij in an introduction to a portfolio of their work published in Artforum in 2008, art historian Pamela M.

The very concept of focus presupposes a dialectic between discreteness and contextual embeddedness: To focus is to draw attention to this by ignoring that. In the act of bringing an image into focus, the filmmaker prompts scrutiny of an object while also articulating the fact that the rest of the world is still out there, beyond the edge of the frame. This dialectic is key to De Rooij‚Äôs work, where the same meticulous care is given to display elements and framing devices as to the art itself.\\"  Exhibitions  Institutional solo exhibitions include Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Dresden (2019); Kunstwerke Berlin (2017); IMA Brisbane (2017); MMK Museum of Modern Art, Frankfurt/Main (2016); Le Consortium, Dijon (2015); The Jewish Museum, New York (2014); Piktogram, Warsaw (2012); Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin (2010); MAMBo Bologna (2008); K21, D√ºsseldorf (2007); Secession, Vienna (2005) and Kunsthalle Z√ºrich (2003).

She is one of the most prominent and prolific artists of the Arabic revolutionary contemporary art scene. As a Palestinian living in the Gaza Strip for her formative years and the daughter of Rashad al-Shawa, activist and mayor of Gaza 1971‚Äî82, Shawa's revolutionary mindset was inculcated at a young age. Often her artwork, which includes paintings, sculptures, and installations, works with photographs that serve as the base for silkscreen printing. Her work has been internationally exhibited and is displayed in many public (e.g. The British Museum) and private collections.Contemporary Art in The Middle East, ArtWorld, Black Dog Publishing, London, UK, 2009.The October Gallery: Laila Shawa. October Gallery. Accessed Nov 2010)Laila Shawa, Works 1965- 1994 AI-Hani Books, 1994  Early life  Laila Shawa was born in Gaza in 1940, eight years prior to the Palestinian Nakba and the founding of the State of Israel. Shawa was well educated; she attended boarding school at the Leonardo da Vinvi Art Institute in Cairo from 1957‚Äî58, then went to the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome from 1958‚Äî64, while also studying during the summers at the School of Seeing in Salzburg, Austria. In 1965, after finishing her schooling, Laila Shawa returned to Gaza and directed arts and crafts classes in several refugee camps. She then continued to teach an art class for a year with UNESCO's education program. She then moved to Beirut, Lebanon in 1967 for a total of nine years and was a full-time painter. After the Lebanese Civil War began, she returned to Gaza and with assistance from both her father and husband, Shawa founded the Rashad Shawa Cultural Centre. Unfortunately, the center is not currently being used for what it was intended, as a cultural connection to Gaza through exhibitions and galas.  Hands of Fatima  The painting, Hands of Fatima, was created by Laila Shawa during the year of 1992. The height of the painting is eighty-nine centimeters high, and the width is seventy centimeters long. The museum number of this piece is 1992,0414,0.1, and is currently, not on display. It is positioned in a vertical composition. Shawa uses oil and acrylics on canvas. The background of the painting is dark with a yellow moon crescent, but it is paralleled with bright and vibrant colors of women in niqabs with unique patterns in each. Their eyes filled in black, and there are open hands that have the sign of the evil eye, and have painted henna designs. The painting is considered a Middle East and North Africa Modern Art style. The painting, Hands of Fatima is from Laila Shawa‚Äôs series called Women and Magic that reconnoiters a common practice of magic and witchcraft in the middle east. This opens the discussion on how people govern their destiny to unknown powers, and that the things people do come from a mysterious authority outside their own control. Moreover, the hands in the painting, are covered in henna and has the evil eye attached to it. According to Nadir Yurtoƒülu in History Studies International Journal of History, the evil eye is a belief in many cultures in which, through envy, people can cause harm to one another. By including the evil eye into her piece, Shawa is using that belief as the women in the painting are preventing harm that may approach them by using the belief that a higher power can do so. The women in the painting are also veiled, and in an Interview with Muslima, Shawa explains how the veil is what she terms as a Bidaa, something which was introduced to Islam, but has nothing to do with Islamic teachings rather than a sociopolitical spectacle created to subdue women. So, the women in this piece are essentially affected by that sociopolitical endeavor. In the book, The Origins of Palestinian Art, the authors Bashir Makhoul and Gordon Hon present the ways in which Palestinian artists have altered a lot of the most intriguing approaches of contemporary art in ways that seem to carry these approaches into direct engagement with a very tangible and crucial political struggle. In this case, Laila Shawa is presenting to her audience the political struggle of being a Palestinian Muslim woman living in occupied Palestinian state, and relying on higher powers to carry their existence and faith. \\\\----  Artistic career  In an interview with the Princeton University Art Museum, Laila Shawa was asked what it is that inspires her, to which she responded, \\"My inspiration is my direct experiences. It's usually what I see, what's around me, so it is contemporary. I prefer to do the present, now, with issues that are very relevant...my artwork is a very creative process, a mixture of intellectual processes, observations, and I think it out very thoroughly.\\" Shawa's more thoughtful and creative approach in producing art is seen in all her various forms of artwork: painting, print, and installation. The overall configuration and detail of Islamic architecture influenced Shawa's later work as she incoorporated significant cultural and ideological elements. Laila Shawa‚Äôs first show outside of the Middle East, Women and Magic, was in London in 1992. She did not begin to find international acclaim until 1994, when she collaborated with Mona Hatoum and Balqees Fakhro in a show titled Forces of Change: Artists of the Arab World at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington DC. Her most well-known work in the 21st century is 2010‚Äôs Walls of Gaza III, Fashionista Terorrista, which is a screen print originating from Shawa‚Äôs photographs. The photo shows garments, a scarf and a sweater, which symbolize the Palestinian resistance decorated with a Swarovski crystal New York patch to visualize how the people of the west use the Arab struggle as a fashion statement.

The core of the shahida model revolves around a troubling confusion of eroticization and weaponization.

For Shawa, this was no foreign object, but rather a quite common one in the West Bank. At the AKA Peace Exhibition, while standing next to her piece, she said, \\"I'm very familiar with AK-47s so for me it was not a very strange feeling to carry the gun, but my first question to Bran was 'how many people did this gun kill?'\\" Shawa entitled her glamored rifle, 'Where Souls Dwell,\\" a powerful name attached to an intensely charged piece of art. It is decorated with \\"rhinestones and butterflies and with the barrel sprayed gold.\\" This is only one example of the artwork by Laila Shawa, but bears light into the pain each work displays.

There are many rock and other material sculptures and paintings of this cosmic visualization. The ananta shayana padmanabha is a beautiful expression in temples across many parts of Bharata. Notable ones are at Thiruvananthapuram and large open air rock relief of the Hindu god Vishnu, carved during the early 9th Century in the Saranga village, under the Parjang police station, in Dhenkanal district of Orissa, India. It is located on the left bank of the Brahmani River. It is the largest such exposed rock cut structure in the horizontal position measuring in length, in the whole of India, while the largest standing image is of Gomateshwara in Southern India. It is a protected monument maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India, Bhubaneswar Circle. Worship is still offered to the four armed reclining Vishnu. Location The Vishnu image, located on the left bank of the river bed of the Brahmani River, is at an elevation of . It is accessible by road over a distance of from Saranga Village in Parajanga Tehsil of Dhenkanal district, from Dhenkanal, 23 km from Angul and from Talcher. It is also approached from the National Highway 42 from Cuttack to Sambalpur, on branch road over distance of 3 km. The second natural rock-cut image in parent rock is at Bhimakand in Talcher subdivision of the Dhankal district. History The image was carved during the first quarter of the 9th century CE when the Bhauma-Kara that ruled in central part of Orissa. It has been analysed on the basis of its \\"idiom and crown\\" and dated to belong to later part of the Bhaumakara reign. Historical records also indicate that the Nandodhbahav feudatory rulers, under the Bhaumakara kings, who were followers of Vaishnavism (the Hindu sect which worships Vishnu as the Supreme God), were instrumental in getting the carvings of two large rock-cut images of Vishnu - the one at Saranga and the other at Dankal, in the upper Brahmani River valley. The Bhaumakara kings asserted their association with Vaishnavism in the grants that they provided to carve the rock-cut sculptures and temples as recorded on the occasion of the celebrations of Vishuvazakranthi and Devtesvaduadasi. It is also reported that the urge to create these carved sculptures with deep expressions of \\"vigour and vitality\\" was inspired from the expressions depicted in the rock cut temples at Ellora and Elephanta in Maharashtra, and Mahabalipuram temples in Tamil Nadu. Such carvings on entrance gates or central part of regular temple lintels have been noted in the Rajeevlochana temple at Rajim and the Lakshmana temple in Sirpur, which were forerunners for to its adoption under the Bhaumakara kingdom. Description The Vishnu image, under the open sky, occupies an area measuring in length and in width with a thickness of . The image is of the Hindu god Vishnu in a reclining position (Anantashayana in Sanskrit, literally sleeping on the serpent Ananta). The image is carved out of natural rock of sandstone formation. He has four arms, holding a Chakra in the upper right hand, a Shankha in his upper left hand, a Gada and a symbolic lotus on its lower left hand. The hoods of the serpent Shesha (Ananta) covering the head of Vishnu. The Vishnu image has a sharp chin, distinctive nose and wears a crown on its head, called kiritamukuta (a tall conical crown, typically worn by Vishnu). A lotus design shown sprouting from his navel has the creator god Brahma, sitting in meditation. Another image in the same district also carved in sandstone in a reclining posture is in Khamkanaga Subdivision, in Angul district of length (as against the length of image in Saranga village. The sculptor has imagined the river bank conceptually to represent the Kshirasagara (cosmic ocean) from which Brahma created the world. The shrine is regularly worshipped by local people. The Archaeological Survey of India is renovating this sculpture regularly and has kept it in a good condition. Floods in Brahmani River are the only threat to the image as this is built by sandstone in the river bed, which could erode.

The DOt was abolished and its functions absorbed by the new Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure in April 2013.  Ministerial portfolios  At the time of its abolition, the Department of Transport supported three Ministerial portfolios, the Minister for Public Transport, the Minister for Roads (the Hon Terry Mulder MLA) and the Minister for Ports (the Hon David Hodgett MLA). It also supported one Parliamentary Secretary for Transport (Mr Gary Blackwood MLA).  Governance  Three container ships berthed at Swanson Dock West at the Port of Melbourne. The port is Australia's prime container port and is managed by the Port of Melbourne Corporation. The Department of Transport was established in 2008 and assumed the transport portfolio responsibilities of the former Department of Infrastructure. The activities and powers of the Department of Transport were governed by both the portfolios of its Ministers, the Minister for Public Transport, the Minister for Roads, the Minister for Ports and by the Transport Integration Act 2010.Transport Integration Act 2010, see in particular, Part 3 of the Act. The Department initially started its operation under the Transport Act 1983,This Act has since been renamed the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983. which contained an old and minimalist policy framework for the Department and parts of the broader transport portfolio. The development of the Transport Integration Act after a comprehensive process driven by the Transport Legislation Review provided policy and organisational coherence to the Victorian transport portfolio by clarifying the central coordinating role of the Department of Transport. It also provided the Department and its statutory authorities and offices with a clear and modern policy framework and new organisational charters. The charter of the Department was made up of its objects and functions set out in the Transport Integration Act and these commenced in June 2010. The Secretary of the Department of Transport was Jim Betts who was promoted to the role from the office of Director of Public Transport. = Objects = The objects of the Department were set out in the Transport Integration Act as: ::\\"(a) ensure that a transport system is provided consistent with the vision statement and the transport system objectives; ::(b) determine strategic policies which specify priorities for the transport system that address current and future challenges; ::(c) ensure in collaboration with transport bodies and other bodies that policies and plans for an integrated and sustainable transport system are developed, aligned and implemented.\\"Section 32, Transport Integration Act 2010. = Functions = The Transport Integration Act provided that the \\"...principal function of the Department is to assist the Minister in the administration of this Act and other transport legislation...\\"Section 33(1), Transport Integration Act 2010.

The Act also provided the Secretary of the Department with a range of specific powers including the power to enter into any agreement or contract.See sections 34-37, Transport Integration Act 2010.  Particular responsibilities  Victoria's highway network. The Transport Integration Act imposed a range of responsibilities on the Department of Transport, including: * preparation of Victoria's transport plan and revising that plan periodicallyTransport Integration Act 2010, section 63. * coordination of agencies' corporate plans across the transport portfoliosTransport Integration Act 2010, section 64. * taking the lead in policy and legislation reviewTransport Integration Act 2010, section 33(2)(a) and (b). including projects such as the Transport Legislation Review  Transport portfolio agencies  DOT oversaw and coordinated the activities of the state agencies responsible for the transport system in Victoria. These agencies were divided into three main types - statutory offices, statutory authorities and independent transport safety agencies. Together with DOT, the agencies provided, managed and regulated transport system activities in Victoria including - * heavy and light rail systems including trains and trams * roads systems and vehicles including cars, trucks and bicycles * ports and waterways including commercial shipsNote, some shipping matters are controlled by the Commonwealth government under legislation such as the Navigation Act 1912. Other matters are within the jurisdiction of states such as Victoria through Acts such as the Transport Integration Act and other statutes such as the Marine Act 1988. and recreational vessels * some air transport systems.Note, many air transport regulation matters are controlled by the Commonwealth Government. The Transport Integration Act would apply, for example, to planning controls at some airports and in respect of transport connections to other airports by road and rail. = Statutory offices = Craigieburn Bypass north of Melbourne. Victoria has an extensive road network managed by VicRoads. The statutory offices included - * the Director of Public Transport * the Transport Infrastructure Development Agent. These agencies were part of the Department of Transport but each had a distinct statutory charter and powers.For information relating to the Director of Public Transport, see Division 1 of Part 5 of the Transport Integration Act 2010. The charter and powers of the Transport Infrastructure Development Agent were set out in Division 4 of Part 3 of the Transport Integration Act 2010. = Statutory authorities = A Melbourne tram (C class tram number 3017) at the St Vincents Plaza stop in East Melbourne. Melbourne has the largest tram network of any city in the world and trams play a key role in the city's public transport system. The statutory authoritiesSee Parts 5 and 6, Transport Integration Act 2010. are - * the Roads Corporation (VicRoads) * the Public Transport Victoria (PT) * Victorian Rail Track (VicTrack) * V/Line Corporation (V/Line) * the Taxi Services Commission * the Linking Melbourne Authority * the Port of Melbourne Corporation * the Port of Hastings Development Authority * the Victorian Regional Channels Authority * the Transport Ticketing Authority * the Regional Rail Link Authority. These agencies were structurally separate from the Department of Transport.The Act established these agencies as structurally separate bodies with their own legal personality. For example, section 81(4) of the Transport Integration Act 2010 established VicRoads as a \\"body corporate\\" which \\"may do and suffer all acts and things that a body corporate may by law do and suffer\\". Transport for Victoria, a new statutory authority, would eventually be created in 2016, combining planning functions of Public Transport Victoria and VicRoads as well as functions of other agencies. = Independent transport safety agencies = A coach in V/Line livery at Stawell station in regional Victoria. The coach is operated by Trotters under contract. Buses are a key part of Victoria's overall public transport system. The independent transport safety agenciesPart 7, Transport Integration Act 2010. are - * the Director, Transport Safety (Transport Safety Victoria) * the Chief Investigator, Transport Safety. These agencies were part of the Department of Transport but were functionally independent and reported to the relevant Ministers.Section 194, Transport Integration Act 2010. The Director, Transport Safety has oversight of safety regulation schemes and industry performance under the schemes, while the Chief Investigator, Transport Safety is responsible for no blame or just culture inquiries and investigations in the transport sector.

Together with Ernest Douwes Dekker and Soewardi Soerjaningrat he was one of the three founders of the influential Indische Party, a political party disseminating the idea of self-government of the Dutch East Indies. After the party was labeled subversive by colonial court of law in 1913, he and his fellow IP leaders were exiled to the Netherlands. Tjipto advocated an Indies-based nationalism rather than Javanese nationalism.Hatta, M. \\"Recht en Vrijheid\\" in the Dutch chapter of the \\"League Against Imperialism and Colonial Oppression\\". (Periodical, vol. 1, no 2, 27 x 37, Amsterdam, 1927) Unlike other Javanese nationalist leaders, Tjipto's belief in democracy remained strong until the end of this life and in his view the traditional character of feudal Javanese civilization had to change. He considered western education and its subsequent social and cultural dislocation as indispensable in creating a revolutionary atmosphere. He disagreed with Budi Utomo's emphasis on the reinvigoration of traditional Javanese civilization. In a 1916 debate he stated: ‚ÄúThe psyche of the Javanese people needs to be changed to such an extent that a change of language, or more cynically a killing of a language becomes urgent. Only in this way will it be possible to build another language on its ruins and also another civilization.\\"Mangoenkoesoemo, Tjipto \\"Kolonial Onderwijs Congress\\", 1916, P.55 Tjipto married his Indo (Eurasian) wife Marie Vogel in 1920. When the three IP leaders returned to the Dutch East Indies his two compagnons eventually took the path of education, while Tjipto always remained politically active. After his exile he was involved in the 'Insulinde (Political Party)' which was transformed into the new 'Nationaal Indische Party' of which he became one of the leaders and its representative in the Peoples Assembly (Dutch: Volksraad (Dutch East Indies)).Meijer, Hans In Indi√´ geworteld.

When Sukarno, future President of Indonesia, moved to Bandung, he gradually alienated from his first political mentor and father in law Tjokroaminoto (leader of the Sarekat Islam). Tjipto then became his main political mentor and turned him into a convinced radical nationalist. > \\"In some ways this close relationship between Tjipto and Sukarno was not > surprising; both were highly intelligent men and extremely sensitive to the > reality of the colonial situation, an injustice they took as a personal > insult.\\"Penders, Christiaan Lambert Maria The life and times of Sukarno > (Publisher: Sidgwick & Jackson, London, 1974) P. 18 Both men were relentless and uncompromising independence fighters professing a deep concern with the plight of the poor peasant.

Tjipto co-founded the 'National Party of Indonesia' (PNI), chaired by Sukarno. Soon thereafter he attempted to foment revolt among the Indonesians serving in the KNIL and was exiled again in 1927, this time to Banda. On Banda he was later joined by other leading revolutionaries like Hatta and Sjahrir. However, during his 11-year-long exile he was unable to further any significant political activity. He died in 1943 and was buried in Ambarawa. After Indonesian independence the 'Centrale Burgerlijke Ziekeninrichting Salemba' was renamed the 'Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital'.

Organisations such as the BBC, CBS and ABC use lip-ribbon microphones to cover events including motor racing, wrestling, processions and demonstrations.  Design  = Noise reduction = Lip- ribbon microphones use baffles to create an acoustic labyrinth within the body of the microphone. The microphone's bi-directional polar pattern controls interference; sound from the commentator reaches one side of the ribbon more than the other, whereas sounds from other sources contact both sides of the ribbon (at a difference in phase of 180¬∞) and cancel out. The labyrinth design also allows lip-ribbon microphones to withstand wind speeds of up to without affecting speech. This resistance can be further strengthened with the use of wind shields. = Frequency response = The microphone is subject to increased bass when used at close proximity in pressure gradient mode. Distant sources are not affected by this. However, increasing the distance between the source and microphone levels the frequency response, and will decrease the noise of ambient sound by the same level. As a result of this, many lip-ribbon microphones use a fixed mouth guard to ensure a distance of between source and microphone. Any plosive effects are then controlled by means of pop shields and meshes. Lip-ribbon microphones are more efficient at noise reduction at lower frequencies.

It creates a force that pulls down plates as they are subducting and speeds up their movement, creating larger amounts of displacement. It is because of these forces, slab pull, ridge push, mantle convection, and slab suction that the earth's crust is able to move and orient itself in various arrangements. This is how throughout the earth's history there has been the ability to create super continents where all of the land mass has converged into one (for example, Pangaea). Slab suction occurs when a subducting slab drives flow in the lower mantle by exerting additional force down in the direction of the mantle's convection currents. This flow then exerts shear tractions on the base of nearby plates. This driving force is important when the slabs (or portions thereof) are not strongly attached to the rest of their respective tectonic plate. They cause both the subducting and overriding plate to move in the direction of the subduction zone.Conrad, C. P.; Lithgow-Bertelloni, C (2002). \\"How Mantle Slabs Drive Plate Tectonics\\". Science. 298 (5591): 207‚Äì209. Bibcode:2002Sci...298..207C. doi:10.1126/science.1074161. PMID 12364804 This force occurs between two colliding plates where one is subducting beneath the other. As one plate subducts, it sets up convection currents in the upper mantle that exert a net trenchward pull, and acts to suck both the plates together. Slab suction compared to slab pull is weaker, but not as much you might expect, considering slab pull is the strongest of the driving forces. When measuring the forces of these two mechanisms, slab pull in subducting plate boundaries for upper mantle slabs is 1.9 √ó 10^21 N. In comparison slab suction in the upper and lower mantle totaled 1.6 √ó 10^21 N.Conrad, C. P.; Lithgow-Bertelloni, C (2002). \\"How Mantle Slabs Drive Plate Tectonics\\". Science. 298 (5591): 207‚Äì209. Bibcode:2002Sci...298..207C. doi:10.1126/science.1074161. PMID 12364804 Slab suction in coordination with slab pull are used to analyze the speeds of plates work. When you combine the slab pull of the upper mantle slabs with the slab suction of lower mantle slabs you get a model showing that subducting plates move four times faster than non subducting plates. Computing the slab suction force can give us predictions of the plate velocities by using viscous flow driven by the slabs and adding it to the shear tractions the flow exerts of the base of the plates. Due to the flow in the lower mantle causing slab suction, changes in viscosity will have a much different effect than how it would apply to the upper mantle. In the lower mantle if you have a decrease in viscosity the flow will become much more rapid and increase the effect of slab suction and if viscosity in the lower mantle increases the effects of slab suction will decrease. Associated with the slab suction force is the idea of trench roll- back. As a slab of oceanic crust subducts into the mantle, the hinge of the plate (the point where the plate begins to subduct) tends to regress away from the trench. This occurs because there is effectively no force to hold the hinge in one location.

Background  In 1996 a working group of the Dutch TeX User's Group created a word list for spell checking and hyphenation to be used in TeX software. This list is also used in OpenOffice.org and has been developed since. At the end of 2005 the Dutch Language Union (Nederlandse Taalunie), the formal Dutch language institute, published a new version of the \\"Woordenlijst Nederlandse Taal\\" (Dutch Language Word list, also known as \\"the Green Booklet\\"). The new spelling rules laid down in it are compulsory in government and education of participating countries since August, 2006. To comply with the spelling changes, the existing free language files had to be adjusted. At the same time, the opportunity arose to have them certified by the Dutch Language Union. The OpenTaal project was founded to facilitate the collaboration of open source projects in this area.  Projects  = Spell checking = OpenTaal provides files for spelling check which are being used in software such as OpenOffice.org, Firefox,Dutch Dictionary add-on for Firefox Thunderbird,Dutch Dictionary add-on for Thunderbird Safari, Opera, TinyMCE and more.

The medieval Old Parish Church is located in the centre of Falkirk, and may have been founded as early as the 7th century. The church was largely rebuilt in the 19th century, though the 18th-century steeple was retained. The church building is protected as a category A listed building. History Some time after the sixth century the speckled church or Faw Kirk was founded, it is from this church that the town of Falkirk takes its name. Malcolm Canmore, King of Scotland, is also said to have established a church here in 1057. In 1166 the church was given to Holyrood Abbey. The earliest parts of the present building date to around 1450, and indicate that the medieval church was on a cruciform plan, with a tower at the centre. The tower was rebuilt between 1738 and 1741 to designs by the architect William Adam. Proposals for renovation or extension of the church were put forward from the 1790s, and lengthy disagreements ensued. In 1810 the matter came before the Court of Session, which ruled that the tower should be retained, but the remaining medieval building should be demolished and replaced. The proposals of James Gillespie Graham were adopted, and the contract was awarded to William Black, wright and Henry Taylor, mason. By autumn 1811 the works were completed, at a cost of around ¬£3,500. A session house was added on the south side in 1893, designed by Wardrop & Anderson. The Old Parish Church merged in 1986 with St Modan's Parish Church to form the present congregation. A number of medieval carved stones are preserved inside the church, including effigies of nobles, which formerly crowned tombs which presumably stood within the medieval church building, and a 12th-century cross-head. Burials The grave of Patrick Murehead of Rashyhill, Trinity Church, Falkirk Notable tombs in the churchyard include: *Sir John de Graeme, who was killed at the Battle of Falkirk on 22 July 1298. His gravestone has been replaced twice over the centuries. The present slab is said to be a copy of the original, and bears the inscription: *Sir John Stewart of Bonkyll, also killed at the Battle of Falkirk is buried here.

He was officially credited with destroying ten enemy aircraft over China and the Pacific. He is famous for inventing the hineri-komi half-loop-and-roll technique that was employed in dogfighting by many Japanese fighter pilots. Career Mochizuki enlisted in IJN in 1925 and completed its pilot training program in November 1926. He first served on carrier Kaga and then on carrier H≈çsh≈ç, before he was transferred to a fighter squadron based at ≈åmura Naval Air Station in Nagasaki Prefecture on Kyushu. In November 1932, he was transferred to Yokosuka Air Group, which was at the time considered as an elite unit consisting of the very best fighter pilots in IJN. In November 1936, Mochizuki was promoted to Warrant Officer. At the outbreak of Second Sino-Japanese War he was transferred to 13th Air Group that operated from Shanghai. After six months of combat over China, he was recalled back to Japan. In October 1941 he was promoted to Ensign. In March 1943, Mochizuki was appointed division leader (buntaich≈ç) in the newly-formed 281st Air Group that was stationed in the Kuril Islands. The same year he was transferred to Roi in the Marshall Islands. After USN carrier strikes destroyed most of the IJN aircraft in the Marshalls, he became stranded on Roi. Mochizuki disappeared and was presumed killed during the American invasion on 6 February 1944. \\"Hineri-komi\\" maneuver During his four-year stay with Yokosuka Air Group, Mochizuki invented and developed hineri-komi (Êçª„ÇäËæº„Åø‚Äîliteral meaning: twist inside) maneuver that allows an aircraft, which is being chased by an enemy, to come at the chaser's tail or to gain an opportunity to take a shot at it. Minoru Genda, who was also part of Yokosuka Air Group at the same time, observed this technique during the training sessions with Mochizuki and helped to formalize it in order to be widely adopted by other IJN pilots in dogfights. The maneuver starts by a steep climb into a half loop, where the pilot applies (e.g., right) rudder to yaw his aircraft and perform a side slip. At the top of the loop the aircraft ends up inverted and pointing outside of the loop's vertical plane. At that point, the pilot applies hard reverse (e.g., right) rudder while at the same time applies (e.g., right) aileron to roll the aircraft in the opposite direction of the applied reverse rudder. After the resulting twisting motion, the pilot uses elevator to pull the aircraft up, which brings it into a horizontal flight in the same direction as the loop begun.

It was founded in 1841 based on Croatian Illyrian movement. Because the movement did not distinguish Croats from other South Slavs and instead called them all Illyrians, the party was named the Illyrian Party or the People's Party (Ilirska stranka, Narodna stranka) when it was formed in late 1841, and it participated in the councils of the Vara≈ædin County and the Bjelovar-Kri≈æevci County. It was one of the two parties in the 1843 session of the Croatian Parliament. Some of its champions from this time included Janko Dra≈°koviƒá, Ivan Kukuljeviƒá Sakcinski, Josip Juraj Strossmayer and Ivan Ma≈æuraniƒá. July victims In 1855, a monument was erected for the July victims in Zagreb. The July victims () were members of the Croatian People's Party who fell victim to a crackdown by the Austrian Imperial Army on July 29, 1845. With the restoration of the Zagreb County, local elections were held around the Croatian capital Zagreb. When it was announced that the Hungarian-allied candidate won, members of the People's Party took to St. Mark's Square to protest the result. The Croatian ban, ethnic Hungarian Franz Haller called on the Austrian army to empty the square. When the army moved in to empty the square, one of its officers was attacked by a protester. The army then moved in with force. In the end, thirteen of the People's Party's protesters were killed and 27 were injured. Due in large part to this incident, ban Haller left his post and bishop Juraj Haulik took his place soon after. This incident showed the tension developed between Croats who supported the Illyrian movement and the restoration of a unified Croatian Kingdom, and Hungarian-Croatians (Magyars) and some Croats who supported closer relations with Hungary (represented by the Croatian-Hungarian Party). In the following years, Croatia did gain some concessions as Croatian replaced Latin as the nation's official language. Later history In 1861, the People's Party sent 58 deputies in the Croatian Parliament out of a total of 106. It went under the name People's Liberal Party (). Also in 1861, in the Kingdom of Dalmatia, their sister party in Dalmatia was founded. Later in the 19th century, the party developed a more Magyar-oriented stance, which eventually caused a faction to form the Independent People's Party () in 1880, led by Matija Mrazoviƒá and 22 other parliamentary representatives. The party journal was Obzor, giving rise to their members nickname obzora≈°i. The People's Party remained in power but enabled a policy of Magyarization, which resulted in major discontent with ban Khuen Hedervary in 1903. In 1905, the Independent People's Party joined the Croatian-Serbian Coalition (Hrvatsko- srpska koalicija), together with the Party of Rights, as well as the Independents and the Radicals. The People's Party was technically active until 1918, when Austro-Hungary ceased to exist after World War I. Legacy The People's Party was not reformed in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. An unrelated people's party, the Puƒçka stranka, was created in 1919, but it was a right-wing party, with different aims and origins to the original People's Party. It in turn ceased to exist on January 21, 1929. The Croatian People's Party, founded in 1990, claims lineage from the People's Party.

It is the third direct-to-video film based on the Saturday morning cartoon series by Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Inc.. The film was produced by Hanna-Barbera. It is the third of the first four Scooby-Doo direct-to-video films to be animated overseas by Japanese animation studio Mook Animation. It was the last film to feature Mary Kay Bergman as the voice of Daphne before her death on November 11, 1999 and the film was dedicated to her memory. Plot The gang is driving through a desert in Roswell, New Mexico when a sandstorm forces Shaggy to make a wrong turn onto government property. Soon after, a UFO causes Shaggy to crash the Mystery Machine, and the gang finds themselves on the outskirts of a small town. While Scooby and Shaggy stay with the van, Fred, Daphne, and Velma go to a local diner to ask for directions. Shaggy and Scooby then see a mythical animal called a jackalope, which takes their last Scooby Snack. They chase the jackalope into a cave, where they encounter frog-like aliens. They flee the cave and run into the diner in a panic. Scooby and Shaggy tell the people inside the diner about their encounter, but the gang is skeptical. The waitress, Dottie, says that multiple people claimed to have seen aliens, but that she has never seen them, though she has noticed strange lights and sounds at night. The chef, Sergio, says that a month earlier, local cattle vanished without a trace, after which many people left town. A man named Lester, who claims to have been abducted, believes Scooby and Shaggy. He also claims to have pictures from his abduction; however, they turn out to be nothing more than paintings. He then tells the gang that ever since the installation of SALF (Search for Alien Life Forms), there have been numerous reports of UFO sightings and disappearing livestock. The gang stays overnight at Lester's home; however, its lack of space forces Scooby and Shaggy to sleep on the roof. Later that night, they are abducted. The aliens try to examine the two, but Scooby is able to free them. After being cornered by the aliens while trying to escape, they pass out. They are awakened in the middle of the desert by a hippie Native American photographer named Crystal, and her golden retriever, Amber. Shaggy and Scooby immediately fall in love with them, before meeting up with the rest of the gang at the diner. The gang sets out to find a mechanic to repair their van when they meet Steve, Laura, and Max, who work for SALF. Fred, Velma, and Daphne take a tour of the SALF facilities, while Crystal and Amber take Scooby and Shaggy to try to find and photograph the jackalope. During the tour, Velma grows suspicious after noticing dried mud on the SALF crew's boots (which would not be found in the middle of the desert) and a large amount of oil (which Max claimed was for the satellite dishes, even though it is the wrong kind). While trying to find the jackalope, Scooby, Shaggy, Crystal, and Amber are forced to leave the area by two government agents. However, Crystal reveals that she is an undercover government agent sent to investigate the aliens, and the four enter a nearby cave. Lester takes the rest of the gang to a canyon where Velma believes a seasonal river runs so they can investigate. The canyon proves to be dry, but they find tire tracks, and follow them into a cave full of mining equipment - the same cave Scooby and Shaggy are in. Both parties find a massive amount of gold in the cave's walls before being found and chased by aliens. Fred, Velma, and Daphne are captured, but Shaggy, Scooby, Crystal, and Amber escape. The aliens reveal themselves to be the SALF crew, and they explain that they stumbled onto the cave while searching for a new location to place another SALF dish. Because the gold was found on government land, they decided to keep it all for themselves by using alien disguises and two fake government agents to keep people away. After the fake agents corner Scooby, Shaggy, Crystal, and Amber, Crystal and Amber reveal themselves to be real aliens. They disguised themselves as hippies because the only information they had about Earth was from watching the 1960s television broadcasts. The UFO that ran the gang off the road was actually Crystal and Amber's spaceship. The gang, Crystal, and Amber manage to stop the SALF crew from escaping and tie them up. The SALF crew and their accomplices are arrested, while Crystal and Amber return to their home planet after a heartfelt goodbye. Shaggy and Scooby are heartbroken, but a box of Scooby Snacks helps them forget about their sorrows. As the gang drives off, the jackalope reappears and looks to the sky as Crystal and Amber's ship passes by one last time.

The first films had done so well the studio considered Scooby-Doo a tentpole property that would sell \\"no matter what\\". Witch's Ghost had a troubled production, with studio executives insisting the team follow a script written by outside screenwriters that the crew considered unsatisfactory. Unlike its predecessor, Alien Invaders was a largely smooth- sailing production, with little executive oversight. The film was written by Davis Doi and Lance Falk, with Glenn Leopold contributing small elements. Reception The film received mixed to positive reviews by critics. It received an approval rating of 80% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on five reviews. David Parkinson of Radio Times, gave the film a three out of five stars, saying, \\"This cartoon adventure is the best of a spate of feature-length spin- offs from the much loved TV series.\\"https://www.radiotimes.com/film/wsbw/scooby-doo-and-the-alien- invaders/ Common Sense Media gave the film a three out of five star and said: \\"Those meddling kids\\" encounter brief alien scares.\\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/scooby-doo-and-the- alien-invaders References External links * * Category:2000 films Category:2000 animated films Category:2000 direct-to-video films Category:2000s American animated films Category:American children's animated comic science fiction films Category:American children's animated mystery films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Jim Stenstrum Category:Warner Bros.

He graduated in 1940 from medical school at the University of Copenhagen and trained in anesthesiology from 1949 to 1950 at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston. He became involved in the 1952 poliomyelitis outbreak in Denmark, where 2722 patients developed the illness in a 6-month period with 316 suffering respiratory or airway paralysis. Treatment had involved the use of the few negative pressure ventilators available, but these devices, while helpful, were limited and did not protect against aspiration of secretions. After detecting high levels of CO2 in blood samples and inside a little boy's lung, Ibsen changed management directly. He instituted protracted positive pressure ventilation by means of intubation into the trachea, and enlisting 200 medical students to manually pump oxygen and air into the patients lungs. In this fashion, mortality declined from 90% to around 25%. Patients were managed in 3 special 35 bed areas, which aided charting and other management. In 1953, Ibsen set up what became the world's first Medical/Surgical ICU in a converted student nurse classroom in Kommunehospitalet (The Municipal Hospital) in Copenhagen, and provided one of the first accounts of the management of tetanus with muscle relaxants and controlled ventilation.

Extensive use of firewood leads to deforestation and the electricity production capacity is too low for the current level of consumption. Zimbabwe has one hydropower plant and four coal-fired generators that produce a total combined capacity of 2,240 megawatts (MW). Only 39.9% of the population have access to electricity. Greenhouse gas emissions from Zimbabwe‚Äôs energy sector come from combustion of carbon-based fuels as well as fugitive emissions during coal mining processes. As part of Zimbabwe‚Äôs national climate change response policy, the country vowed to promote energy efficiency, reduce carbon emissions, and develop low- carbon energy infrastructure. Animal Power Animal power is a very useful source of energy in Zimbabwe. It is estimated that animals contribute with the equivalent of 6.8 million liters of diesel in the agricultural sector. Fuelwood Fuelwood is the most important domestic fuel in Zimbabwe. It was estimated to stand for about 50% of the total consumption in 2001. This has led to deforestation in parts of the country with accompanying environmental problems such as erosion and diminishing wildlife. Coal Zimbabwe has 30 billion tons of coal in 21 known deposits. This could last for over 100 years at the 2001 rate of production. In September 2013, the Chinese-backed company China Africa Sunlight Energy said it would begin work in early 2014 on a 600 MW coal-fired electricity plant in western Zimbabwe, part of $2 billion of energy projects in the country. Liquid Fuels Zimbabwe has no oil or gas resources of its own and is completely dependent on imports for this source of energy.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/geos/zi.html CIA Factbook: Zimbabwe 2010 A pipeline from the Mozambique port of Beira to Mutare provides the majority of Zimbabwe's refined petroleum and diesel oil; the rest comes from South Africa. An ambitious project to produce 20% of the country's liquid fuel as ethanol from cane has been started in Chipinge, Manicaland. Electricity Electricity is generated at the Kariba Dam (ca. 750 MW), the Hwange Thermal Power Station (installed capacity 920 MW) and three minor coal-fired stations. All coal-fired stations are in need of major upgrades due to neglect of maintenance and they have frequent production stops or are not producing at all. This leads to frequent and long lasting blackouts. The governmental owned Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) is the countries power generating and distributing company. Imports of energy from neighbouring countries are not enough to solve the undercapacity problem and lack of electricity hampers economic growth. Small scale power generators are used all over the country to ease the situation. =Renewable energy= Apart from the Kariba Dam power station, hydropower in Zimbabwe has still a lot of potential, especially along the Zambezi river. Solar power has enormous potential both in small scale, such as water heating or in larger scale such as in solar power plants. However, the nation's current economic condition makes adequately rapid solar power buildups seem unrealistic, short of capital infusions and technology transfers from the developed world economies. Yet there is a thriving solar power industry with over a dozen companies providing solar power systems for residences and commercial enterprises with the largest PV power system of about 600 kWp for the Kefalos cheese factory. Wind turbine farms and biogas energy could be other possibilities for developing a renewable energy infrastructure for Zimbabwe which could comply with the post-2015 sustainable development goals. A project in partnership with the United Arab Emirates will result in the construction of a 2,000 MW solar power plant, built in two phases. If completed it would be the largest solar power plant in the world.

Naipaul, and informally, Vidia Naipaul, was a Trinidad and Tobago-born British writer of works of fiction and nonfiction in English. He is known for his comic early novels set in Trinidad, his bleaker novels of alienation in the wider world, and his vigilant chronicles of life and travels. He wrote in prose that was widely admired, but his views sometimes aroused controversy. He published more than thirty books over fifty years. Naipaul won the Booker Prize in 1971 for his novel In a Free State. In 1989, he was awarded the Trinity Cross, Trinidad and Tobago's highest national honour. He received a knighthood in Britain in 1990, and in 2001, the Nobel Prize in Literature. In the late 19th century, Naipaul's grandparents had emigrated from India to work in Trinidad's plantations as indentured servants. His breakthrough novel A House for Mr Biswas was published in 1961. On the fiftieth anniversary of its publication, he dedicated it to Patricia Anne Hale, to whom he was married from 1955 until her death in 1996, and who had served as first reader, editor, and critic of his writings. Early life Naipaul was born on 17 August 1932 in Chaguanas, Trinidad and Tobago. He was the second child of Droapatie Capildeo and Seepersad Naipaul, and had a Hindu upbringing. His younger brother was the writer Shiva Naipaul.https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/shiva-naipaul In the 1880s, his grandparents had migrated from India to work as indentured labourers on the sugar plantations. In the Indian immigrant community in Trinidad, Naipaul's father became an English-language journalist, and in 1929 began contributing articles to the Trinidad Guardian. In 1932, the year Naipaul was born, his father joined the staff as the Chaguanas correspondent. In \\"A Prologue to an Autobiography\\" (1983), Naipaul describes how his father's reverence for writers and for the writing life spawned his own dreams and aspirations to become a writer. In 1939, when he was six years old, Naipaul's family moved in with them in a big house in Trinidad's capital, Port of Spain. There, Naipaul enrolled in the government-run Queen's Royal College, a well- regarded school that was modelled after a British public school. Upon graduation, Naipaul won a Trinidad Government scholarship that allowed him to study at any institution of higher learning in the British Commonwealth; he chose Oxford. Education in England At University College, Oxford, Naipaul's early attempts at writing, he felt, were contrived. Lonely and unsure of his ability and calling, he became depressed. In April 1952, he took an impulsive trip to Spain, where he quickly spent all he had saved. He called his impulsive trip \\"a nervous breakdown\\". Thirty years later, he called it \\"something like a mental illness\\". In 1952, before visiting Spain, Naipaul met Patricia Ann Hale, his future wife, at a college play. With Hale's support, he began to recover and gradually to write. She became a partner in planning his career. Her family was hostile to the relationship; his was unenthusiastic. In June 1953, Naipaul and Hale graduated from Oxford. Naipaul graduated with a second-class degree. Peter Bayley, his Oxford tutor, would later comment that Naipaul \\"had not quite forgiven us for giving him a second-class degree\\". In 1953, Naipaul's father died. He worked at odd jobs and borrowed money from Hale and his family in Trinidad. Life in London Naipaul moved to London in 1954. In January 1955, he and Pat were married. In December 1954, he began appearing on the BBC radio programme Caribbean Voices once a week. Sitting in the BBC freelancers' room in the old Langham Hotel, he wrote \\"Bogart\\", the first story of Miguel Street, which was inspired by a neighbour he knew as a child in Port of Spain. Naipaul wrote Miguel Street in five weeks. The New York Times said about the book: \\"The sketches are written lightly, so that tragedy is understated and comedy is overstated, yet the ring of truth always prevails.\\"Poore, Charles (5 May 1960), \\"Miguel Street\\" The New York Times. Retrieved 20 June 2014. Early Trinidad novels Diana Athill, an editor at the publishing company Andr√© Deutsch, read Miguel Street and liked it, but publisher Andr√© Deutsch thought a book of short stories by an unknown Caribbean writer unlikely to sell profitably in Britain. He encouraged Naipaul to write a novel. Naipaul quickly wrote The Mystic Masseur and it was published in 1955. In 1956, Naipaul returned to Trinidad and Tobago for a two- month stay with his family. Travelling by ship there, he sent humorous sketches of the ship's West Indian passengers to Pat. These sketches became the inspiration for The Suffrage of Elvira, a comic novella about a rural election in Trinidad. In 1957, Naipaul became an editorial assistant at the Cement and Concrete Association (C&CA;), his only full-time job. The C&CA; was to be the setting for Naipaul's later novel, Mr Stone and the Knights Companion (1963). At this time the New Statesman's Kingsley Martin gave Naipaul a part-time job reviewing books, a job he did from 1957 to 1961. The Mystic Masseur was awarded the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize in 1958, and Miguel Street the Somerset Maugham Award in 1961 with W. Somerset Maugham himself approving the first-ever selection of a non-European for the prize. Seepersad Naipaul, father of V. S. Naipaul, and the inspiration for the protagonist of the novel, Mr Biswas, with his Ford Prefect. For his next novel, A House for Mr Biswas (1961), Naipaul took for inspiration childhood memories of his father (later he wrote that the novel \\"destroyed memory\\" in some respects). In the novel the title character Mohun Biswas takes a succession of vocations (apprentice to a Hindu priest, signboard painter, grocery store proprietor, and reporter for The Trinidad Sentinel). What ambition and resourcefulness Mr Biswas has are inevitably undermined by his dependence on his powerful in-laws and the vagaries of the colonial society in which he lives. The book consumed Naipaul. In 1983, he wrote: Novels and travel writing After completing A House for Mr Biswas, Naipaul and Pat spent the next five months in British Guiana, Suriname, Martinique and Jamaica, where Naipaul took notes for The Middle Passage: Impressions of Five Societies ‚Äì British, French and Dutch in the West Indies and South America, his first travel book. He wrote, \\"The history of the islands can never be told satisfactorily. Brutality is not the only difficulty. History is built around achievement and creation; and nothing was created in the West Indies.\\" In 1962, Naipaul and Pat went to India, the land of Naipaul's ancestors, where Naipaul wrote An Area of Darkness. For the first time in his life, he felt anonymous, even faceless. He was no longer identified, he felt, with a special ethnic group as he had been in Trinidad and England; it made him anxious. He was upset by what he saw as the resigned or evasive Indian reaction to poverty and suffering. While in India, Naipaul wrote Mr Stone and the Knights Companion. He accepted an invitation to write a monthly \\"Letter from London\\" for The Illustrated Weekly of India. Naipaul had spent an overwrought year in India. Back in London, after An Area of Darkness was completed, he felt creatively drained. He felt he had used up his Trinidad material. Neither India nor the writing of Mr Stone and the Knights Companion, his only attempt at a novel set in Britain with white British characters, had spurred new ideas for imaginative writing. His finances too were low, and Pat went back to teaching to supplement them. Naipaul's books had received much critical acclaim, but they were not yet money makers. Socially, he was now breaking away from the Caribbean Voices circle, but no doors had opened to mainstream British society. That changed when Naipaul was introduced to Antonia Fraser, at the time the wife of conservative politician Hugh Fraser. Fraser introduced Naipaul to her social circle of upper-class British politicians, writers, and performing artists. In this circle was the wealthy second Baron Glenconner, father of novelist Emma Tennant and owner of estates in Trinidad, who arranged for an unsecured loan of ¬£7,200 for Naipaul. Naipaul and Pat bought a three-floor house on Stockwell Park Crescent. In late 1964, Naipaul was asked to write an original script for an American movie. He spent the next few months in Trinidad writing the story, a novella named \\"A Flag on the Island\\", later published in the collection A Flag on the Island. The finished version was not to the director's liking and the movie was never made. The story is set in 1964, in a Caribbean island that is not named. The main character is an American named Frankie who affects the mannerisms of Frank Sinatra. Frankie has links to the island from having served there during World War II. He revisits reluctantly when his ship anchors during a hurricane. Naipaul wilfully makes the pace of the book feverish, the narrative haphazard, the characters loud, the protagonist fickle or deceptive, and the dialogue confusing. Balancing the present time is Frankie's less disordered, though comfortless, memory of 20 years before. Then he had become a part of a community on the island. He had tried to help his poor friends by giving away the ample U.S. Army supplies he had. Not everyone was happy about receiving help and not everyone benefited. Frankie was left chastened about finding tidy solutions to the island's social problems. This theme, indirectly developed in the story, is one to which Naipaul would return. Not long after finishing A Flag on the Island, Naipaul began work on the novel The Mimic Men, though for almost a year he did not make significant progress. At the end of this period, he was offered a Writer-in-Residence fellowship at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. There, in early 1966, he began to rewrite his material, and went on to complete the novel quickly. The finished novel broke new ground for him. Unlike his Caribbean work, it was not comic. It did not unfold chronologically. Its language was allusive and ironic, its overall structure whimsical. It had strands of both fiction and non-fiction, a precursor of other Naipaul novels. It was intermittently dense, even obscure, but it also had beautiful passages, especially descriptive ones of the fictional tropical island of Isabella. The subject of sex appeared explicitly for the first time in Naipaul's work. The plot, to the extent there is one, centres on a protagonist, Ralph Singh, an East Indian-West Indian politician from Isabella. Singh is in exile in London and attempting to write his political memoirs. Earlier, in the immediate aftermath of decolonization in a number of British colonies in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Singh had shared political power with a more powerful African-Caribbean politician. Soon, the memoirs take on a more personal aspect. There are flashbacks to the formative and defining periods of Singh's life. In many of these, during crucial moments, whether during his childhood, married life, or political career, he appears to abandon engagement and enterprise. These, he rationalizes later, belong only to fully made European societies. When The Mimic Men was published, it received generally positive critical notice. In particular, Caribbean politicians, such as Michael Manley and Eric Williams weighed in, the latter writing: \\"V. S. Naipaul's description of West Indians as 'mimic men' is harsh but true ...\\" Back in London in October 1966, Naipaul received an invitation from the American publisher Little, Brown and Company to write a book on Port-of-Spain. The book took two years to write, its scope widening with time. The Loss of El Dorado (1969) eventually became a narrative history of Trinidad based on primary sources. Pat spent many months in the archives of the British Library reading those sources. In the end, the finished product was not to the liking of Little, Brown, who were expecting a guidebook. Alfred A. Knopf agreed to publish it instead in the United States, as did Andr√© Deutsch later in Britain. The Loss of El Dorado is an attempt to ferret out an older, deeper history of Trinidad, one preceding its commonly taught history as a British- run plantation economy of slaves and indentured workers. Central to Naipaul's history are two stories: the search for El Dorado, a Spanish obsession, in turn pursued by the British, and the British attempt to spark from their new colony of Trinidad, even as it was itself becoming mired in slavery, a revolution of lofty ideals in South America. Sir Walter Raleigh and Francisco Miranda would become the human faces of these stories. Although slavery is eventually abolished, the sought for social order slips away in the face of uncertainties created by changeable populations, languages, and governments and by the cruelties inflicted by the island's inhabitants on each other. Before Naipaul began writing The Loss of El Dorado, he had been unhappy with the political climate in Britain. He had been especially unhappy with the increasing public animosity, in the mid-1960s, towards Asian immigrants from Britain's ex-colonies. During the writing of the book, he and Pat sold their house in London, and led a transient life, living in the homes of friends, sometimes for rent, sometimes not. After the book was completed, they travelled to Trinidad and Canada with a view to finding a location in which to settle. Naipaul had hoped to write a blockbuster, one relieving him of future money anxieties. As it turned out, The Loss of El Dorado sold only 3,000 copies in the US, where major sales were expected; Naipaul also missed England more than he had calculated. It was thus in a depleted state, both financial and emotional, that he returned to Britain. Earlier, during their time in Africa, Naipaul and Pat had travelled to Kenya, staying a month in Mombasa on the Indian Ocean coast. They had travelled in rural Uganda to the Kisoro District on the south-western border with Rwanda and the Congo. Naipaul showed interest in the great culture, history and traditions of the Baganda people. When Uganda's prime minister Milton Obote deposed, militarily, the President of Uganda, who was also the Kabaka of Buganda, Naipaul was critical of the British press for not condemning the action enough. Naipaul also travelled to Tanzania with a young American he had met in Kampala, Paul Theroux. It was upon this African experience that Naipaul would draw during the writing of his next book, In a Free State, published in 1971. In the title novella, \\"In a Free State\\", two young expatriate Europeans drive across an African country, which remains nameless but which offers clues of Uganda, Kenya, and Rwanda. The novella speaks to many themes. The colonial era ends and Africans govern themselves. Political chaos, frequently violent, takes hold in newly decolonized countries. Young, idealistic, expatriate whites are attracted to these countries, seeking expanded moral and sexual freedoms. They are rootless, their bonds with the land tenuous; at the slightest danger they leave. The older, conservative, white settlers, by contrast, are committed to staying, even in the face of danger. The young expatriates, though liberal, can be racially prejudiced. The old settlers, unsentimental, sometimes brutal, can show compassion. The young, engrossed in narrow preoccupations, are uncomprehending of the dangers that surround them. The old are knowledgeable, armed, and ready to defend themselves. The events unfolding along the car trip and the conversation during it become the means of exploring these themes. In a Free State received the 1971 Booker Prize and was effectvely Naipaul's critical and commercial breakthrough. Later works In 1974, Naipaul wrote the novel Guerrillas, following a creative slump that lasted several years.Smyer, Richard (Autumn 1992), \\"Review: A New Look at V. S. Naipaul\\", Contemporary Literature, Vol. 33, No. 3, pp. 573‚Äì581. A Bend in the River, published in 1979, marks the beginning of his exploration of native historical traditions, deviating from his usual \\"New World\\" examinations.Cooke, John (December 1979), \\"'A Vision of the Land': V,S, Naipaul's Later Novels\\", Caribbean Quarterly, Vol. 25, No. 4, Caribbean Writing: Critical Perspectives, pp. 31‚Äì47. Naipaul also covered the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, Texas, at the behest of Robert B. Silvers, editor of The New York Review of Books, after which Naipaul wrote \\"Among the Republicans\\",Naipaul, V. S. (25 October 1984), \\"\\"Among the Republicans\\", The New York Review of Books. an anthropological study of a \\"white tribe in the United States\\". In 1987, The Enigma of Arrival, a novel in five sections, was published. Naipaul continued to write non-fiction works, his last being The Masque of Africa: Glimpses of African Belief (2010), written following the author's trips to Africa in 2008‚Äì09. The book explores indigenous religious beliefs and rituals, where Naipaul portrays the countries he visited in real life as bleak, and the people primitive.Meyers, Jeffrey (Spring 2011), \\"Review: Beyond Belief\\", The Antioch Review, Vol. 69, No. 2, pp. 386‚Äì389. Critical responses In awarding Naipaul the 2001 Nobel Prize in Literature, the Swedish Academy praised his work \\"for having united perceptive narrative and incorruptible scrutiny in works that compel us to see the presence of suppressed histories.\\" The Committee added: \\"Naipaul is a modern philosopher carrying on the tradition that started originally with Lettres persanes and Candide. In a vigilant style, which has been deservedly admired, he transforms rage into precision and allows events to speak with their own inherent irony.\\" The Committee also noted Naipaul's affinity with the novelist Joseph Conrad: Naipaul's fiction and especially his travel writing have been criticised for their allegedly unsympathetic portrayal of the Third World. The novelist Robert Harris has called Naipaul's portrayal of Africa racist and \\"repulsive,\\" reminiscent of Oswald Mosley's fascism. Edward Said argued that Naipaul \\"allowed himself quite consciously to be turned into a witness for the Western prosecution\\", promoting what Said classified as \\"colonial mythologies about wogs and darkies\\". Said believed that Naipaul's worldview may be most salient in his book-length essay The Middle Passage (1962), composed following Naipaul's return to the Caribbean after 10 years of exile in England, and the work An Area of Darkness (1964). Naipaul was accused of misogyny, and of having committed acts of \\"chronic physical abuse\\" against his mistress of 25 years, Margaret Murray, who wrote in a letter to The New York Review of Books: \\"Vidia says I didn't mind the abuse. I certainly did mind.\\" Writing in The New York Review of Books about Naipaul in 1980, Joan Didion offered the following portrayal of the writer: Nissim Ezekiel wrote the 1984 essay \\"Naipaul's India and Mine\\" as a reply to Naipaul's An Area of Darkness. Personal life During his first trip to Argentina, in 1972, Naipaul met and began an affair with Margaret Murray Gooding, a married Anglo-Argentine mother of three. He revealed his affair to his wife one year after it began, telling her that he had never been sexually satisfied in their relationship. In Patrick French's biography, Naipaul recounts his domestic abuse towards Margaret: \\"I was very violent with her for two days with my hand...She thought of it in terms of my passion for her...My hand was swollen.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/books/review/Packer-t.html French writes that the \\"cruelty [for Naipaul] was part of the attraction\\".French 2008, p.97 He moved between both women for the next 24 years. In 1995, as he was traveling through Indonesia with Gooding, his wife Patricia was hospitalized with cancer. She died the following year. Within two months of her death, Naipaul ended his affair with Gooding and married Nadira Alvi, a divorced Pakistani journalist more than 20 years his junior. He had met her at the home of the American consul-general in Lahore. In 2003, he adopted Nadira's daughter, Maleeha, who was then 25. Awards and recognition Naipaul was awarded the Booker Prize for In a Free State in 1971.He won the Jerusalem Prize in 1983. He was awarded the Trinity Cross in 1990.https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/books/review/Shaftel-t.html He was also made a knight bachelor at the 1990 New Year Honours. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2001. Death Naipaul died at his home in London on 11 August 2018. Before dying he read and discussed Lord Tennyson‚Äôs poem 'Crossing the Bar' with those at his bedside. His funeral took place at Kensal Green Cemetery.
