History The New Brunswick Student Alliance/L'Alliance √©tudiante du Nouveau-Brunswick (NBSA/A√âNB) is a bilingual student advocacy organization which operates in New Brunswick, Canada. Representing over 12,000 post- secondary students at four university campuses across the province, the NBSA works to convey student issues, concerns, and perspectives to the provincial, federal and inter-provincial government. The NBSA works with the province, university administrators and faculty, and other stakeholders toward its goal of an affordable, accessible, and high-quality post-secondary education system in New Brunswick. The organization was first established in 1982 as the New Brunswick Coalition of Students. It was founded to better reflect the diversity and needs of New Brunswick post-secondary students than other student organizations that existed in New Brunswick at the time. In 1983, the NBCS became the NBSA. The organization continued to develop its identity, governance model, and public image throughout the 1980s. In 1986, the NBSA experienced its first major policy success in the awarding of two student representative seats on the Maritime Provinces Higher Education Commission. Shortly thereafter, the NBSA experienced a decline in participation and folded temporarily. The 1990s were marked by major cutbacks to the post-secondary education system in New Brunswick. By 1995, the need for a province-based student advocacy movement had resurged and the NBSA was reassembled. The NBSA gained significant exposure in years that followed. It successfully formed relationships with each of the province‚Äôs major political parties, seeing all party leaders sign a pledge to help post-secondary students prior to the 1998 New Brunswick election. The NBSA hired its first Executive Director in the mid-2000s. The organization went on to advocate for the creation of a Post- Secondary Education Commission and a separate government ministry for post- secondary education. In 2006, the NBSA embarked on a large scale campaign to raise awareness of student issues by hosting a ‚ÄúDay of Action,‚Äù which saw television, radio, and media ads run during the 2006 provincial election. A new Post-Secondary Education Commission commenced in 2007. The NBSA recommended a debt cap, improved repayment options for student loans, and tuition regulation. In 2008, the NBSA held demonstrations across the province calling for a cap on student loan debt. In that year‚Äôs budget, the provincial government announced the creation of the Timely Completion Benefit that capped student debt at $26,000 and introduced a new repayment assistance program for recent graduates. In 2010, the Board of Directors eliminated the Executive Director position, electing to operate on a reduced budget without staff support. In 2013, the position was reinstated. In recent years, the NBSA has re-emerged as a strong voice for post-secondary students in New Brunswick. It has built upon existing relationships with each of the province‚Äôs major political parties, and has successfully forged new relationships with government, university administrators, and faculty associations. The NBSA has been very vocal in the past as New Brunswick went through multiple initiatives to report and improve on its post-secondary education system. These include the Commission on Post-secondary Education report \\"Advantage New Brunswick: A province reaches to fulfill its destiny, the Working Group Report and the final Government of New Brunswick \\"Action Plan to Transform Post-secondary Education\\". In addition to being active during the 2014 provincial election, the organization continues to actively meet with Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) to provide elected officials with a look into the post- secondary student experience, and to provide suggestions for improving the system in the short- and long-term. The NBSA‚Äôs current policy positions include strategic investments in student financial aid, the elimination of in- study and summer earnings assessments, and an expansion of experiential learning opportunities. In the face of a struggling provincial economy, the NBSA continues to work with all stakeholders toward a better post-secondary system and a stronger New Brunswick. Structure and staff The current organizational structure consists of two elected executives and a full-time executive director, working out of an office in Fredericton, New Brunswick. The two executive positions may be held by any student who is a member. The Board of Directors of the NBSA consists, in general, of the Vice-President Externals of member student unions (or VP Education in the case of the St. Thomas University Students' Union) as the voting members and the associated Presidents as observers. All student members are permitted to attend Board meetings and/or participate on committees. =Executive director= * Wasiimah Joomun =Executive Team= *Chair: Patrick Hickey (University of New Brunswick Students' Representative Council) *Vice-Chair: Sarah Kohut (St. Thomas Students' Union) =Current members= *Mount Allison Students‚Äô Union (MASU) *University of New Brunswick Student Union (UNBSU) *University of New Brunswick Saint John Student Representative Council (UNB SRC) *St. Thomas University Students' Union (STUSU) Past executive directors 2019-2020: Kjeld-Mizpah (KJ) Conyers-Steede 2018-2019: Emily Blue 2017-2018: Samuel Titus 2016-2017: Robert Burroughs 2015-2016: Lindsay Handren 2013-2015: Patrick Joyce 2009-2010: M√©lissa Cormier 2007-2009: Heather Elliott 2005-2007: Claude Hach√© ReferencesExternal links * Category:Students' associations in Canada Category:Universities and colleges in New Brunswick Category:Groups of students' unions Category:Organizations based in Fredericton Category:1982 establishments in New Brunswick ","title":"New Brunswick Student Alliance"},{"id":"1623124","text":"Banten city from illustration c. 1724. Banten, also written as Bantam, is a port town near the western end of Java, Indonesia. It has a secure harbour at the mouth of Banten River, a navigable passage for light craft into the island's interior. The town is close to the Sunda Strait through which important ocean-going traffic passes between Java and Sumatra. Formerly Old Banten was the capital of a sultanate in the area, was strategically important and a major centre for trade. History In the 5th century Banten was part of the Tarumanagara kingdom. The Lebak relic inscriptions, found in lowland villages on the edge of Ci Danghiyang, Munjul, Pandeglang, Banten, were discovered in 1947 and contains 2 lines of poetry with Pallawa script and Sanskrit language. The inscriptions mentioned the courage of king Purnawarman. After the collapse of the kingdom Tarumanagara following an attack by the Srivijaya empire, power in western Java fell to the Kingdom of Sunda. The Chinese source, Chu-fan-chi, written c. 1200, Chou Ju-kua mentioned that in the early 13th Century, Srivijaya still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java (Sunda). The source identifies the port of Sunda as strategic and thriving, pepper from Sunda being among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture and their houses were built on wooden poles (rumah panggung). However, robbers and thieves plagued the country. It is highly possible that the port of Sunda mentioned by Chou Ju-kua referred to the port of Banten. According to Portuguese explorer, Tom√© Pires, in the early 16th century the port of Bantam (Banten) was one of the important ports of the Kingdom of Sunda along with the ports of Pontang, Cheguide (Cigede), Tangaram (Tangerang), Calapa (Sunda Kelapa) and Chimanuk (estuarine of Cimanuk river). As a trading city Bantam received an influx of Islamic influence in the early 16th century. Later in the 16th century Bantam became the seat of the powerful Banten Sultanate. English Bantam The English East India Company began to send ships to the East Indies around 1600 and established a permanent trading post at Bantam in 1603, as did the Dutch also. In 1613, John Jourdain was appointed as Chief Factor there, holding the administrative post until 1616, apart from a few months of 1615, when Thomas Elkington was Chief Factor; he was succeeded in 1616 by George Berkley, but from 1617 until 1630 the factory was under a chosen President. From 1630 until 1634 a succession of Agents were appointed annually, but from 1634 the series of Presidents resumed until 1652. Aaron Baker (1610-1683) served for twenty years as President of Bantam, as is recorded on his mural monument in Dunchideock parish church, Devon. In the thirty years following 1603, the trading factories established by the English on the Coromandel Coast of India, such as those at Machilipatnam (estd. 1611) and Fort St. George (estd. 1639), reported to Bantam.N. S. Ramaswami, Fort St. George, Madras, Pub. No. 49, Tamilnadu State Department of Archaeology (T.N.S.D.A.), Madras, First Edition 1980 During the 17th century, the Portuguese and the Dutch fought for control of Bantam. Eventually, the fact that the Dutch found they could control their Batavia trading factory, established in 1611, more thoroughly than Bantam may have contributed to the decline of the English trading post. The town today Today, Banten is a small local seaport, in the economic shadow of the neighbouring port of Merak to the west and Jakarta to the east. There is a significant Chinese presence in the community. In fiction South-Bantam or Bantan-Kidoel or Lebak was the place where the eponymous character in Multatuli's novel Max Havelaar acted as the assistant-resident.

Software that allows remote administration is becoming increasingly common and is often used when it is difficult or impractical to be physically near a system in order to use it. A remote location may refer to a computer in the next room or one on the other side of the world. It may also refer to both legal and illegal (i.e. hacking) remote administration (see Owned and Trojan).  Requirements  Internet connection = Any computer with an Internet connection, TCP/IP or on a Local Area Network can be remotely administered. For non-malicious administration, the user must install or enable server software on the host system in order to be viewed. Then the user/client can access the host system from another computer using the installed software. Usually, both systems should be connected to the internet, and the IP address of the host/server system must be known. Remote administration is therefore less practical if the host uses a dial-up modem, which is not constantly online and often has a Dynamic IP. = Connecting = When the client connects to the host computer, a window showing the Desktop of the host usually appears. The client may then control the host as if he/she were sitting right in front of it. Certain versions of Windows XP have a built-in remote administration package called Remote Desktop Connection. A free cross-platform alternative is VNC, which offers similar functionality. Common tasks for which remote administration is used Shutdown = * Shutting down or rebooting another computer over a network = Accessing peripherals = * Using a network device, like printer * Retrieving streaming data, much like a CCTV system = Modifying = * Editing another computer's Registry settings * Modifying system services * Installing software on another machine * Modifying logical groups = Viewing = * Remotely assisting others * Supervising computer or internet usage * Access to a remote system's \\"Computer Management\\" snap-in =Hacking= Computers infected with malware such as Trojans sometimes open back doors into computer systems which allows malicious users to hack into and control the computer. Such users may then add, delete, modify or execute files on the computer to their own ends. Notable software Windows = Windows Server 2003, 2008, Tablet PC Editions, and Windows Vista Ultimate, Enterprise and Business editions come with Microsoft's Microsoft Management Console, Windows Registry Editor and various command-line utilities that may be used to administrate a remote machine. One form of remote administration is remote desktop software, and Windows includes a Remote Desktop Connection client for this purpose. Windows XP comes with a built-in remote administration tools called Remote Assistance and Remote Desktop, these are restricted versions of the Windows Server 2003 Terminal Services meant only for helping users and remote administration. With a simple hack/patch (derived from the beta version of Windows XP) it's possible to \\"unlock\\" XP to a fully featured Terminal Server. Windows Server 2003 comes with built-in remote administration tools, including a web application and a simplified version of Terminal Services designed for Remote administration. Active Directory and other features found in Microsoft's Windows NT Domains allow for remote administration of computers that are members of the domain, including editing the Registry and modifying system services and access to the system's \\"Computer Management\\" Microsoft Management Console snap-in. Some third-party remote desktop software programs perform the same job. Back Orifice, whilst commonly used as a script kiddie tool, claims to be a remote-administration and system management tool. Critics have previously stated that the capabilities of the software require a very loose definition of what \\"administration\\" entails. Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 7 enables IT administrators to manage roles and features that are installed on remote computers that are running Windows Server 2008 R2 = Non-Windows = VNC can be used for remote administration of computers, however it is increasingly being used as an equivalent of Terminal Services and Remote Desktop Protocol for multi-user environments. Linux, UNIX and BSD support remote administration via remote login, typically via SSH (The use of the Telnet protocol has been phased out due to security concerns). X-server connection forwarding, often tunnelled over SSH for security, allows GUI programs to be used remotely. VNC is also available for these operating systems. Apple Remote Desktop provides Macintosh users with remote administration capabilities. NX and its Google fork Neatx are free graphical Desktop sharing solutions for the X Window System with Clients for different platforms like Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. There is also an enhanced commercial version of NX Server available. Wireless remote administration Remote administration software has recently started to appear on wireless devices such as the BlackBerry, Pocket PC, and Palm devices, as well as some mobile phones. Generally these solutions do not provide the full remote access seen on software such as VNC or Terminal Services, but do allow administrators to perform a variety of tasks, such as rebooting computers, resetting passwords, and viewing system event logs, thus reducing or even eliminating the need for system administrators to carry a laptop or be within reach of the office. Wireless remote administration is usually the only method to maintain man-made objects in space.

The building, which contains a collection of world art, was one of the first major public buildings to be designed by the architects Norman Foster and Wendy Cheesman, completed in 1978. The building became grade II* listed in December 2012. Design Entrance to the Sainsbury Centre from the UEA campus The Sainsbury Centre building was opened in 1978. It was designed between 1974 and 1976 by the then relatively unknown architect Norman Foster (now Lord Foster). According to Chris Abel, the building exemplifies Foster's early work of \\"a regular structure embracing all functions within a single, flexible enclosure, or 'universal space'\\" where \\"the design is all about allowing for change, internally and externally.\\" The Sainsbury Centre also demonstrates Foster's characteristic work methods of \\"design development\\", or \\"integrated design\\". It is situated on the western edge of the university's campus, beside the River Yare, and also houses the School of World Art Studies and Museology. Foster said of the building \\"A building is only as good as its client and the architecture of the Sainsbury Centre is inseparable from the enlightenment and the driving force of the Sainsburys themselves and the support of the University of East Anglia.\\" The main gallery area of the Sainsbury Centre The main building is sited on sloping, turfed ground, and consists of a large cuboid, clad steel structure. One face is almost entirely glazed, with the prefabricated skeleton clearly visible. Internally, the museum gives the impression of being one vast open space, lacking any internal divisions to interfere with the interplay of natural and artificial light. Services, lighting, toilets and maintenance access are housed in triangular towers and trusses, and between the external cladding and internal aluminium louvres. By the late 1980s the collection had outgrown its accommodation, and Foster was asked to design an extension. Rather than simply extending the existing structure as had been envisaged 15 years earlier, it was decided to look below ground. The sloping site allowed for an enlarged basement to emerge at a curved glass frontage overlooking a man-made lake (an echo of the nearby 13th century Norfolk Broads). There is little clue of the extent of the new wing, except when viewed from the position of this lake. The crescent wing was built by Anthony Hunt Associates and opened in 1991. Robert and Lisa Sainsbury Collection In 1973 Sir Robert Sainsbury and Lady Lisa Sainsbury donated to the university their collection of over 300 artworks and objects, which they had been accumulating since the 1930s. The collection has since increased in size to several thousand works spanning over 5000 years of human endeavour, including pieces by Jacob Epstein, Henry Moore (numerous sculptures can be found dotted around the grounds of the university), Alberto Giacometti, and Francis Bacon, alongside art from Africa (including a 'Fang Reliquary Head' from Gabon and the Nigerian 'Head of an Oba'), Asia, North and South America, the Pacific region, medieval Europe and the ancient Mediterranean.

Based heavily on Siemens/Bramo's earlier experience producing the Bristol Jupiter under license, the Bramo 323 saw limited use. Design and development Development of the 323 was the end result of a series of modifications to the original Jupiter design, which Siemens licensed in 1929. The first modifications produced the Sh.20 and Sh.21. The design was then bored out to produce the 950 hp (708 kW) Sh.22 in 1930. Like the Jupiter, the Sh.22 featured a rather \\"old\\" looking arrangement with rather prominent valve pushrods on the front of the engine. In the mid-1930s the Reich Air Ministry (RLM) altered the way in which engines were assigned code names, and Bramo was given the 300-block of numbers. Therefore, the Sh.14 and Sh.22 became the 314 and 322, respectively. The 322 never matured and remained unreliable. The team continued work on the basic design, adding fuel injection and a new supercharger. The resulting Bramo 323 was just under 27 l in displacement, and produced 900 PS at 2,500 rpm for takeoff, improving slightly to 1,000 PS at . The reduced power at sea level was inevitable for engines with single-speed, mechanically-driven superchargers when they were regulated to a constant maximum boost pressure below their critical altitude. The Fafnir powered a number of German prewar designs, including the Focke-Wulf Fw 200, Henschel Hs 126, Dornier Do 24 and Dornier Do 17, as well as the Focke Achgelis Fa 223 Drache helicopter. Its fairly poor fuel economy kept it from more widespread use, and most designs chose the similar BMW 132 instead, whose specific fuel consumption varied between 220 and 240 g/(kW‚Ä¢h) depending on model, whereas the early versions of the Fafnir got about 255 g/(kW‚Ä¢h), a poor figure for the era. The C/Ds, where the supercharger used less power, improved this to 230 g/(kW‚Ä¢h), but were only useful at lower altitudes. BMW bought Bramo in 1939 and continued production to supply the small number of designs that already used it, notably the Do 17. The naming at this point becomes somewhat confusing, with BMW, Bramo and Fafnir being used almost interchangeably depending on the source. 5,500 were produced before the lines were shut down in 1944. The original 323 design was produced in A and B models, differing in the direction they turned. The engines were intended to be installed in A/B pairs, thereby eliminating engine torque across a twin- engine aircraft. The similar C and D models featured a lower supercharger gearing for better performance at lower altitudes, improving takeoff power to 1,000 PS, but reducing the critical altitude. The final versions, P, R and T, featured a two-speed supercharger for better all-around performance. This allowed it to generate 1,000 PS at sea level as in the C/D models, but improved altitude performance considerably, delivering 940 PS at . The R-2 subtype added MW 50 water-methanol injection for added low-altitude performance, boosting power to 1,200 PS at 2,600 rpm.

It is specified in RFC 2324, published on 1 April 1998 as an April Fools' Day RFC, as part of an April Fools prank. An extension, HTCPCP-TEA, was published as RFC 7168 on 1 April 2014 to support brewing teas, which is also an April Fools' Day RFC. Protocol RFC 2324 was written by Larry Masinter, who describes it as a satire, saying \\"This has a serious purpose - it identifies many of the ways in which HTTP has been extended inappropriately.\\" The wording of the protocol made it clear that it was not entirely serious; for example, it notes that \\"there is a strong, dark, rich requirement for a protocol designed espressoly for the brewing of coffee\\". Despite the joking nature of its origins, or perhaps because of it, the protocol has remained as a minor presence online. The editor Emacs includes a fully functional client side implementation of it,. and a number of bug reports exist complaining about Mozilla's lack of support for the protocol. Ten years after the publication of HTCPCP, the Web-Controlled Coffee Consortium (WC3) published a first draft of \\"HTCPCP Vocabulary in RDF\\" in parody of the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) \\"HTTP Vocabulary in RDF\\". On April 1, 2014, RFC 7168 extended HTCPCP to fully handle teapots. Commands and replies HTCPCP is an extension of HTTP. HTCPCP requests are identified with the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme \`coffee\` (or the corresponding word in any other of the 29 listed languages) and contain several additions to the HTTP methods: { valign=top\`BREW\` or \`POST\`Causes the HTCPCP server to brew coffee. Using POST for this purpose is deprecated. A new HTTP request header field \\"Accept-Additions\\" is proposed, supporting optional additions including Cream, Whole-milk, Vanilla, Raspberry, Whisky, Aquavit, etc. - valign=top \`GET\`\\"Retrieves\\" coffee from the HTCPCP server. - valign=top \`PROPFIND\`Returns metadata about the coffee. - valign=top \`WHEN\`Says \\"when\\", causing the HTCPCP server to stop pouring milk into the coffee (if applicable). } It also defines two error responses: { valign=top\`406 Not Acceptable\`The HTCPCP server is unable to provide the requested addition for some reason; the response should indicate a list of available additions. The RFC observes that \\"In practice, most automated coffee pots cannot currently provide additions.\\" - valign=top \`418 I'm a teapot\`The HTCPCP server is a teapot; the resulting entity body \\"may be short and stout\\" (a reference to the song \\"I'm a Little Teapot\\"). Demonstrations of this behaviour exist. } Save 418 movement On 5 August 2017, Mark Nottingham, chairman of the IETF HTTPBIS Working Group, called for the removal of status code 418 \\"I'm a teapot\\" from the Node.js platform, a code implemented in reference to the original 418 \\"I'm a teapot\\" established in Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol. On 6 August 2017, Nottingham requested that references to 418 \\"I'm a teapot\\" be removed from the programming language Go and subsequently from Python's Requests and ASP.NET's HttpAbstractions library as well. In response, 15-year-old developer Shane Brunswick created a website, save418.com, and established the \\"Save 418 Movement\\", asserting that references to 418 \\"I'm a teapot\\" in different projects serve as \\"a reminder that the underlying processes of computers are still made by humans\\". Brunswick's site went viral in the hours following its publishing, garnering thousands of upvotes on the social platform Reddit, and causing the mass adoption of the \\"#save418\\" Twitter hashtag he introduced on his site. Heeding the public outcry, Node.js, Go, Python's Requests, and ASP.NET's HttpAbstractions library decided against removing 418 \\"I'm a teapot\\" from their respective projects. The unanimous support from the aforementioned projects and the general public prompted Nottingham to begin the process of having 418 marked as a reserved HTTP status code, ensuring that 418 will not be replaced by an official status code for the foreseeable future. On 5 October 2020, Python 3.9 released with an updated http library including \`418 IM_A_TEAPOT\` status code. In the corresponding pull request, the Save 418 movement was directly cited in support of adoption.

The ship was the second U.S. Navy vessel named in honor of both David Porter and his son David Dixon Porter. Porter was laid down by the William Cramp & Sons of Philadelphia, in August 1914 and launched in August of the following year. The ship was a little more than in length, just over abeam, and had a standard displacement of . She was armed with four guns and had eight 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. Porter was powered by a pair of steam turbines that propelled her at up to . After her April 1916 commissioning, Porter conducted her shakedown cruise in the Caribbean. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Porter was part of the first U.S. destroyer squadron sent overseas. Patrolling the Irish and Celtic Sea out of Queenstown, Ireland, Porter severely damaged the German submarine in April 1918. Upon returning to the United States after the war, Porter operated off the east coast until she was decommissioned in June 1922. In June 1924, Porter was transferred to the United States Coast Guard to help enforce Prohibition as a part of the \\"Rum Patrol\\". She operated under the name USCGC Porter (CG-7) until 1933, when she was returned to the Navy. Later that year, the ship was renamed DD-59 to free the name Porter for another destroyer. She was sold for scrap in August 1934.  Design and construction  Porter was authorized in 1913 as the third ship of the which, like the related , was an improved version of the s authorized in 1911. Construction of the vessel was awarded to William Cramp & Sons of Philadelphia, which laid down her keel on 24 August 1914. Twelve months later, on 26 August 1915, Porter was launched by sponsor Miss Georgiana Porter Cusachs, a descendant of the ship's namesakes, Commodore David Porter (1780‚Äì1843) and son Admiral David Dixon Porter (1813‚Äì1891), both notable U.S. Navy officers. As built, Porter was in length and abeam and drew . The ship had a standard displacement of and displaced when fully loaded. Porter had two Curtis steam turbines that drove her two screw propellers, and an additional steam turbine geared to one of the propeller shafts for cruising purposes. The power plant could generate and move the ship at speeds up to . Porters main battery consisted of four /50 Mark 9 guns,The 50 denotes the length of the gun barrels; in this case, the gun is 50 calibers, meaning that the gun is 50 times as long as it is in diameter, in this case. The Mark number is the version of the gun; in this case, the ninth U.S. Navy design of the 4-inch/50 gun. with each gun weighing in excess of . The guns fired armor-piercing projectiles at . At an elevation of 20¬∞, the guns had a range of . Porter was also equipped with eight torpedo tubes. The General Board of the United States Navy had called for two anti-aircraft guns for the Tucker-class ships, as well as provisions for laying up to 36 floating mines. From sources, it is unclear if these recommendations were followed for Porter or any of the other ships of the class.  United States Navy career  USS Porter was commissioned into the United States Navy on 17 April 1916 under the command of Lieutenant Commander Ward K. Wortman. Following her commissioning, Porters shakedown was conducted in the Caribbean. After the United States entry into World War I on 6 April 1917, Porter was readied for overseas duty and departed from New York on 24 April with the other five ships of her division‚Äî (the flagship), , , , and . The sextet arrived at Queenstown, Ireland, on 4 May and began patrolling the southern approaches to the Irish Sea the next day. Based at Queenstown, Porter met and escorted convoys from the United States as they entered the war zone. On 16 October 1917, Porter came to the aid of American destroyer ,Feuer, p. 20. which had been torpedoed by German submarine about south of Mine Head, Ireland. Cassins stern had nearly been blown off and her rudder was gone, leaving the ship unable to steer. Porter arrived at about 16:00 and stayed with Cassin until dusk when two British sloops, and , took over for Porter; Cassin was towed to safety and later returned to patrol duty. On 28 April 1918, Porter severely damaged while that German submarine was steaming to intercept a convoy. The destroyer was transferred to Brest, France, on 14 June. She returned to the United States at the end of the war, and operated off the East Coast until she was decommissioned on 23 June 1922.  United States Coast Guard career  On 17 January 1920, Prohibition was instituted by law in the United States. Soon, the smuggling of alcoholic beverages along the coastlines of the United States became widespread and blatant. The Treasury Department eventually determined that the United States Coast Guard simply did not have the ships to constitute a successful patrol. To cope with the problem, President Calvin Coolidge in 1924 authorized the transfer from the Navy to the Coast Guard of twenty old destroyers that were in reserve and out of commission. Porter was reactivated and transferred to the Treasury Department on 7 June 1924 for use by the Coast Guard. Designated CG-7, Porter was commissioned on 20 February 1925, and was stationed in New York for duties on the \\"Rum Patrol\\" to aid in the attempt to enforce prohibition laws. During her Coast Guard service, Porter captured the rum-running vessel Conseulo II (the former Louise) off the coast of Long Island. After the United States Congress proposed the Twenty-first Amendment to end prohibition in February 1933, plans were made for Porter to be returned to the Navy. On 27 May 1933, Porter arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and was decommissioned nine days later, on 5 June. Porter was transferred back to the Navy on 30 June. Later in 1933 the ship was renamed DD-59 in order to free the name Porter for a new destroyer of the same name. DD-59 remained in noncommissioned status until struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 5 July 1934. She was sold for scrap on 22 August in accordance with the London Naval Treaty.

Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's Union armies had partially encircled the city of Atlanta, Georgia, which was being held by Confederate forces under the command of General John Bell Hood. Sherman had at this point adopted a strategy of attacking the railroad lines into Atlanta, hoping to cut off his enemies' supplies. This was the third direct attack on Confederate positions during the campaign and the effect of success would have ended the siege and won Atlanta on 6 August 1864. Battle Map of Utoy Creek Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. After failing to envelop Hood's left flank at the Battle of Ezra Church, Sherman still wanted to extend his right flank to hit the railroad between East Point and Atlanta. He transferred Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield's XXIII Corps of the USA Army of the Ohio from his left to his right flank and sent him to the north bank of Utoy Creek. Although Schofield‚Äôs troops were at Utoy Creek on August 2, they, along with the XIV Corps, Army of the Cumberland, did not cross until August 4. An initial attack by the Regular Brigade against J. Patton Anderson's Division CSA of Stephen Dill Lee's Corps was unsuccessful. In addition the Confederates dismounted a brigade of cavalry, Armstrong's, in the front of the federals in a deception plan, a feinted attack that was successful in delaying the combined force of the XXIII and XIV Corps USA. Schofield made an additional movement to exploit this situation on the morning of August 5. Although initially successful, Schofield had to regroup his forces, which took the rest of the day. The delay allowed the Confederates to strengthen their defenses with an abatis, which slowed the Union attack when it restarted on the morning of August 6. The Federals were repulsed with heavy losses by William B. Bate's division and failed in an attempt to break the main defenses to gain the railroad. On August 7, the Union troops moved toward the Confederate main line skirmishing and extending to their right and entrenched. Several attacks were made at Sandtown Road (Campbellton at Adams Park) on 10 August and East Point on 18 August. Here US Forces remained, as far south as the Atlanta Christian College, until late August 1864 when the failure of Schofield's offensive operations convinced Sherman to move on the Confederate lines of communication and supply. Aftermath PVT Samuel Grimshaw of the XIV Army Corps, USA was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions against a Confederate Artillery Battery along the Sandtown (Cascade Road) during the main attack on 6 August 1864. PVT Benjamin Van Raalte was nominated for the Congressional Medal of Honor for the recovery of the Unit Colors of the 25th Michigan Infantry, Hascall's Division, XXIII Army Corps, USA. The Federal Colors were captured by the Confederates of Armstrong's Brigade of Cavalry dismounted as infantry. The Confederate Corps Commander, Lt General Steven D. Lee, cited Bate's Division and especially Tyler's and Lewis's Brigades for the repulse of a superior enemy force and the capture of 200 prisoners and three stands of Colors.

A growth medium or culture medium is a solid, liquid or semi-solid designed to support the growth of a population of microorganisms or cells via the process of cell proliferation, or small plants like the moss Physcomitrella patens.Birgit Hadeler, Sirkka Scholz, Ralf Reski (1995) Gelrite and agar differently influence cytokinin-sensitivity of a moss. Journal of Plant Physiology 146, 369‚Äì371 Different types of media are used for growing different types of cells. The two major types of growth media are those used for cell culture, which use specific cell types derived from plants or animals, and microbiological culture, which are used for growing microorganisms, such as bacteria or fungi. The most common growth media for microorganisms are nutrient broths and agar plates; specialized media are sometimes required for microorganism and cell culture growth. Some organisms, termed fastidious organisms, require specialized environments due to complex nutritional requirements. Viruses, for example, are obligate intracellular parasites and require a growth medium containing living cells.  Types  US Food and Drug Administration scientist tests for Salmonella The most common growth media for microorganisms are nutrient broths (liquid nutrient medium) or lysogeny broth medium. Liquid media are often mixed with agar and poured via a sterile media dispenser into Petri dishes to solidify. These agar plates provide a solid medium on which microbes may be cultured. They remain solid, as very few bacteria are able to decompose agar (the exception being some species in the genera: Cytophaga, Flavobacterium, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Alcaligenes). Bacteria grown in liquid cultures often form colloidal suspensions. The difference between growth media used for cell culture and those used for microbiological culture is that cells derived from whole organisms and grown in culture often cannot grow without the addition of, for instance, hormones or growth factors which usually occur in vivo. In the case of animal cells, this difficulty is often addressed by the addition of blood serum or a synthetic serum replacement to the medium. In the case of microorganisms, no such limitations exist, as they are often unicellular organisms. One other major difference is that animal cells in culture are often grown on a flat surface to which they attach, and the medium is provided in a liquid form, which covers the cells. In contrast, bacteria such as Escherichia coli may be grown on solid or in liquid media. An important distinction between growth media types is that of defined versus undefined media. A defined medium will have known quantities of all ingredients. For microorganisms, they consist of providing trace elements and vitamins required by the microbe and especially defined carbon and nitrogen sources. Glucose or glycerol are often used as carbon sources, and ammonium salts or nitrates as inorganic nitrogen sources. An undefined medium has some complex ingredients, such as yeast extract or casein hydrolysate, which consist of a mixture of many chemical species in unknown proportions. Undefined media are sometimes chosen based on price and sometimes by necessity ‚Äì some microorganisms have never been cultured on defined media. A good example of a growth medium is the wort used to make beer. The wort contains all the nutrients required for yeast growth, and under anaerobic conditions, alcohol is produced. When the fermentation process is complete, the combination of medium and dormant microbes, now beer, is ready for consumption. The main types are *Cultural media *Minimal media *Selective media *Differential media *Transport media *Indicator media = Culture media = Culture media contain all the elements that most bacteria need for growth and are not selective, so they are used for the general cultivation and maintenance of bacteria kept in laboratory culture collections. Physcomitrella patens plants growing axenically on agar plates (Petri dish, 9 cm diameter) An undefined medium (also known as a basal or complex medium) contains: * a carbon source such as Glucose * water * various salts * a source of amino acids and nitrogen (e.g., beef, yeast extract) ** This is an undefined medium because the amino-acid source contains a variety of compounds with the exact composition being unknown. A defined medium (also known as chemically defined medium or synthetic medium) is a medium in which * all the chemicals used are known * no yeast, animal, or plant tissue is present Some examples of nutrient media include: * Plate count agar * Nutrient agar * Trypticase soy agar = Minimal media = A defined medium that has just enough ingredients to support growth is called a \\"minimal medium\\". The number of ingredients that must be added to a minimal medium varies enormously depending on which microorganism is being grown. Minimal media are those that contain the minimum nutrients possible for colony growth, generally without the presence of amino acids, and are often used by microbiologists and geneticists to grow \\"wild-type\\" microorganisms. Minimal media can also be used to select for or against recombinants or exconjugants. Minimal medium typically contains: * a carbon source, which may be a sugar such as glucose, or a less energy-rich source such as succinate * various salts, which may vary among bacteria species and growing conditions; these generally provide essential elements such as magnesium, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur to allow the bacteria to synthesize protein and nucleic acids * water Supplementary minimal media are minimal media that also contains a single selected agent, usually an amino acid or a sugar. This supplementation allows for the culturing of specific lines of auxotrophic recombinants. = Selective media = Blood-free, charcoal-based selective medium agar (CSM) for isolation of Campylobacter Blood agar plates are often used to diagnose infection. On the right is a positive Staphylococcus culture; on the left is a positive Streptococcus culture. Selective media are used for the growth of only selected microorganisms. For example, if a microorganism is resistant to a certain antibiotic, such as ampicillin or tetracycline, then that antibiotic can be added to the medium to prevent other cells, which do not possess the resistance, from growing. Media lacking an amino acid such as proline in conjunction with E. coli unable to synthesize it were commonly used by geneticists before the emergence of genomics to map bacterial chromosomes. Selective growth media are also used in cell culture to ensure the survival or proliferation of cells with certain properties, such as antibiotic resistance or the ability to synthesize a certain metabolite. Normally, the presence of a specific gene or an allele of a gene confers upon the cell the ability to grow in the selective medium. In such cases, the gene is termed a marker. Selective growth media for eukaryotic cells commonly contain neomycin to select cells that have been successfully transfected with a plasmid carrying the neomycin resistance gene as a marker. Gancyclovir is an exception to the rule, as it is used to specifically kill cells that carry its respective marker, the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase. Four types of agar plate demonstrating differential growth depending on bacterial metabolism Examples of selective media include: * Eosin methylene blue contains dyes that are toxic for Gram- positive bacteria. It is the selective and differential medium for coliforms. * YM (yeast extract, malt extract agar) has a low pH, deterring bacterial growth. * MacConkey agar is for Gram-negative bacteria. * Hektoen enteric agar is selective for Gram-negative bacteria. * HIS-selective medium is a type cell culture medium that lacks the amino acid histidine. * Mannitol salt agar is selective for Gram-positive bacteria and differential for mannitol. * Xylose lysine deoxycholate is selective for Gram-negative bacteria. * Buffered charcoal yeast extract agar is selective for certain Gram-negative bacteria, especially Legionella pneumophila. * Baird‚ÄìParker agar is for Gram-positive staphylococci. * Sabouraud's agar is selective to certain fungi due to its low pH(5.6) and high glucose concentration(3-4%) * DRBC (Dichloran Rose Bengal Chloramphenicol agar) is a selective medium for the enumeration of moulds and yeasts in foods. Dichloran and rose bengal restricts the growth of mould colonies thus preventing overgrowth of luxuriant species and assisting accurate counting of colonies. = Differential media = urinary tract infections (UTIs). Differential or indicator media distinguish one microorganism type from another growing on the same medium. This type of media uses the biochemical characteristics of a microorganism growing in the presence of specific nutrients or indicators (such as neutral red, phenol red, eosin y, or methylene blue) added to the medium to visibly indicate the defining characteristics of a microorganism. These media are used for the detection of microorganisms and by molecular biologists to detect recombinant strains of bacteria. Examples of differential media include: * Blood agar (used in strep tests) contains bovine heart blood that becomes transparent in the presence of Œ≤-hemolytic organisms such as Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. * Eosin methylene blue is differential for lactose fermentation. * Granada medium is selective and differential for Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) which grows as distinctive red colonies in this medium. * MacConkey agar is differential for lactose fermentation. * Mannitol salt agar is differential for mannitol fermentation. * X-gal plates are differential for lac operon mutants. = Transport media = Transport media should fulfill these criteria: * Temporary storage of specimens being transported to the laboratory for cultivation * Maintain the viability of all organisms in the specimen without altering their concentration * Contain only buffers and salt * Lack of carbon, nitrogen, and organic growth factors so as to prevent microbial multiplication * Transport media used in the isolation of anaerobes must be free of molecular oxygen. Examples of transport media include: * Thioglycolate broth is for strict anaerobes. * Stuart transport medium is a non-nutrient soft agar gel containing a reducing agent to prevent oxidation, and charcoal to neutralize. * Certain bacterial inhibitors are used for gonococci, and buffered glycerol saline for enteric bacilli. * Venkataraman Ramakrishna (VR) medium is used for V. cholerae  Enriched media  Enriched media contain the nutrients required to support the growth of a wide variety of organisms, including some of the more fastidious ones. They are commonly used to harvest as many different types of microbes as are present in the specimen. Blood agar is an enriched medium in which nutritionally rich whole blood supplements the basic nutrients. Chocolate agar is enriched with heat-treated blood (40‚Äì45 ¬∞C), which turns brown and gives the medium the color for which it is named.  Physiological relevance  The choice of culture medium might affect the physiological relevance of findings from tissue culture experiments, especially for metabolic studies. In addition, the dependence of a cell line on a metabolic gene was shown to be affected by the media type. When performing a study involving several cell lines, utilizing a uniform culture media for all cell lines might reduce the bias in the generated datasets. Using a growth medium that better represents the physiological levels of nutrients can improve the physiological relevance of in vitro studies and recently such media types, as Plasmax and Human Plasma Like Medium (HPLM), were developed.

It occurs in a number of different plants, most notably the Middle Eastern plant harmal or Syrian rue (Peganum harmala) and the South American vine Banisteriopsis caapi (also known as \\"yage\\" or \\"ayahuasca\\"). Harmine reversibly inhibits monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), an enzyme which breaks down monoamines, making it a RIMA. Harmine selectively binds to MAO-A but does not inhibit the variant MAO-B.  Biosynthesis  Isolated from the plant Peganum harmala, harmine is an indole alkaloid with the pyrido[3,4-b]indole ring structure that is characteristic of the Œ≤-carboline alkaloids. The Œ≤-carboline alkaloids include harmine, harmaline, harman and harmalol. These molecules are heterocyclic amines, biosynthesized through the combination of five- and six-membered ring structures that are derived from an amino acid (either L-tryptophan or tryptamine), which facilitates the formation of an indole ring system.Wernicke, Catrin, and Jochen Lehmann. \\"Beta-Carbolines: Occurrence, Biosynthesis, and Biodegredation.\\" By Hans Rommelspacher. The coincident occurrence of Œ≤-carboline alkaloids and serotonin in P. harmala indicates the presence of two very similar, interrelated biosynthetic pathways, which makes it difficult to definitively identify whether free tryptamine or L-tryptophan is the precursor in the biosynthesis of harmine. However, it is postulated that L-tryptophan is the most likely precursor, with tryptamine existing as an intermediate in the pathway. The following figure shows the proposed biosynthetic scheme for harmine. The Shikimate acid pathway yields the aromatic amino acid, L-tryptophan. Decarboxylation of L-tryptophan by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) produces tryptamine (I), which contains a nucleophilic center at the C-2 carbon of the indole ring due to the adjacent nitrogen atom that enables the participation in a mannich-type reaction. Rearrangements enable the formation of a Schiff base from tryptamine, which then reacts with pyruvate in II to form a Œ≤-carboline carboxylic acid. The Œ≤-carboline carboxylic acid subsequently undergoes decarboxylation to produce 1-methyl Œ≤-carboline III. Hydroxylation followed by methylation in IV yields harmaline. The order of O-methylation and hydroxylation have been shown to be inconsequential to the formation of the harmaline intermediate. In the last step V, the oxidation of harmaline is accompanied by the loss of water and effectively generates harmine. 350x350px The difficulty distinguishing between L-tryptophan and free tryptamine as the precursor of harmine biosynthesis originates from the presence of the serotonin biosynthetic pathway, which closely resembles that of harmine, yet necessitates the availability of free tryptamine as its precursor. As such, it is unclear if the decarboxylation of L-tryptophan, or the incorporation of pyruvate into the basic tryptamine structure is the first step of harmine biosynthesis. However, feeding experiments involving the feeding of one of tryptamine to hairy root cultures of P. harmala showed that the feeding of tryptamine yielded a great increase in serotonin levels with little to no effect on Œ≤-carboline levels, confirming that tryptamine is the precursor for serotonin, and indicating that it is likely only an intermediate in the biosynthesis of harmine; otherwise, comparable increases in harmine levels would have been observed.  Uses  Harmaline and harmine fluoresce under ultraviolet light. These three extractions indicate that the middle one has a higher concentration of the two compounds. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor Monoamines include neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine), hormones (melatonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine). By slowing the breakdown of neurotransmitters, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) can help to replenish the body's supply of these chemicals, and many MAOIs are used as antidepressants. Harmine has not been the subject of much clinical research in the treatment of depression, which could be due in part to its restricted legal status in many countries. P. harmala and B. caapi are both traditionally used for their psychoactive effects. B. caapi has a tradition of use in conjunction with plants containing the drug DMT. Traditionally, B. caapi is consumed as a drink, with or without the DMT- bearing plants (see Ayahuasca). Ordinarily, DMT is not active when taken orally, but users report very different effects when MAOIs are present in such beverages. Harmine and substances containing it have been used in conjunction with many other drugs by modern experimenters. Many hallucinogens appear to exhibit increased potency when used in this way. Harmine is also a useful fluorescent pH indicator. As the pH of its local environment increases, the fluorescence emission of harmine decreases. With the radioisotope carbon-11 harmine is used in positron emission tomography neuroimaging to examine its competitive binding to MAO-A. Harmine found in root secretions of Oxalis tuberosa has been found to have insecticidal properties. Harmine has been found to increase EAAT2 glutamate pump expression in central nervous system, therefore reducing glutamate toxicity. = Anti-cancer = \\"Harmine showed cytotoxicity against HL60 and K562 cell lines. This could explain the cytotoxic effect of P. harmala on these cells.\\" = Effects on bone and cartilage = \\"Harmine was shown to promote differentiation of osteoblasts (bone-forming cells), and chondrocytes (cells in the cartilage).\\" It was also shown to inhibit osteoclastogenesis (the formation of bone resorbing cells) = Pancreatic islet cell proliferation = Harmine is currently the only known drug that induces proliferation (rapid mitosis and subsequent mass growth) of pancreatic alpha (Œ±) and beta (Œ≤) cells in adult humans. These islet sub-cells are normally very resistant to growth stimulation in the adult stage of a human's life, as the cell mass plateaus at around age 10 and remains virtually unchanged from there on. Other similar drugs have been successful in triggering beta cell proliferation in rats/mice and pigs, however these drugs were met with very limited to no success in human subjects. Harmine was found to increase the diminished beta cell mass of diabetic people to clinically significant levels for a short time: this property proves very useful in a possible harmine-based treatment for both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Harmine is known to be a potent inhibitor of the DYRK1A enzyme pathway. This is thought to be the main mechanism by which harmine can induce alpha and beta cell proliferation in vivo. DYRK1A is an enzyme that plays a definitive role in suppressing/regulating cell proliferation, therefore it makes sense that the partial blocking of DYRK1A increases the growth of certain cells, including pancreatic Œ± and Œ≤ cells. The alteration of many other enzymes and genes that are implicated in cell proliferation have shown no significant results in humans, hence it is still unknown why DYRK1A inhibition specifically can force Œ± and Œ≤ cells to divide and grow, in humans no less.  Adverse effects  Harmine, and plants containing significant amounts of harmine and other harmala alkaloids are generally not considered safe treatments for depression within the medical community. This bias however is primarily built on previous decades of experience with pharmaceutical non-specific MAOIs that block both MAO-A and MAO-B. It has recently been shown in the Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology that beta-carboline MAO inhibitors, such as harmine, bind with DNA and also exhibit anti-tumor properties. Harmine has been shown to bind one hundred times more effectively than its close analogue harmaline. The consequences of this are currently not well understood. Rapid discontinuation of MAO inhibitors can cause serious withdrawal syndrome.  Overdosage  Oral or intravenous harmine doses ranging from 30‚Äì300 mg may cause agitation, bradycardia or tachycardia, blurred vision, hypotension, paresthesias. Serum or plasma harmine concentrations may be measured as a confirmation of diagnosis. The plasma elimination half-life is on the order of 1‚Äì3 hours.R. Baselt, Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man, 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 727-728.  Natural sources  Harmine is found in a wide variety of different organisms, most of which are plants. Alexander Shulgin Pages 713‚Äì714 lists about thirty different species known to contain harmine, including seven species of butterfly in the family Nymphalidae. The harmine-containing plants listed include tobacco, Peganum harmala, two species of passiflora, and numerous others. Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) contains harmine. In addition to B. caapi, at least three members of the Malpighiaceae contain harmine, including two more Banisteriopsis species and the plant Callaeum antifebrile. Callaway, Brito and Neves (2005) found harmine levels of 0.31-8.43% in B. caapi samples. The family Zygophyllaceae, which P. harmala belongs to, contains at least two other harmine-bearing plants: Peganum nigellastrum and Zygophyllum fabago.  Legal status Australia= Harmala alkaloids are considered Schedule 9 prohibited substances under the Poisons Standard (October 2015).Poisons Standard October 2015 https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534 A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities. Exceptions are made when in herbs, or preparations, for therapeutic use such as: (a) containing 0.1 per cent or less of harmala alkaloids; or (b) in divided preparations containing 2 mg or less of harmala alkaloids per recommended daily dose.

Even with transport layer security (TLS) in place to safeguard the portion of the transaction conducted over public networks‚Äîespecially with payment systems‚Äîthe customer-facing website itself must be coded with great care, so as not to leak credentials and expose customers to subsequent identity theft. Despite widespread use in North America, there are still many countries such as China and India that have some problems to overcome in regard to credit card security. Increased security measures include use of the card verification number (CVN) which detects fraud by comparing the verification number printed on the signature strip on the back of the card with the information on file with the cardholder's issuing bank.Turban, E. King, D. McKay, J. Marshall, P. Lee, J & Vielhand, D. (2008). Electronic Commerce 2008: A Managerial Perspective. London: Pearson Education Ltd. p.554 There are companies that specialize in financial transaction over the Internet, such as Stripe for credit cards processing, Smartpay for direct online bank payments and PayPal for alternative payment methods at checkout. Many of the mediaries permit consumers to establish an account quickly, and to transfer funds between their on-line accounts and traditional bank accounts, typically via automated clearing house (ACH) transactions. The speed and simplicity with which cyber-mediary accounts can be established and used have contributed to their widespread use, despite the risk of theft, abuse, and the typically arduous process of seeking recourse when things go wrong. The inherent information asymmetry of large financial institutions maintaining information safeguards provides the end-user will little insight into the system when the system mishandles funds, leaving disgruntled users frequently accusing the mediaries of sloppy or wrongful behavior; trust between the public and the banking corporations is not improved when large financial institutions are revealed to have taken flagrant advantage of their asymmetric power, such as the 2016 Wells Fargo account fraud scandal. Methods of online payment Credit cards constitute a popular method of online payment but can be expensive for the merchant to accept because of transaction fees primarily. Debit cards constitute an excellent alternative with similar security but usually much cheaper charges. Besides card-based payments, alternative payment methods have emerged and sometimes even claimed market leadership. = Bank payments = This is a system that does not involve any sort of physical card. It is used by customers who have accounts enabled with Internet banking. Instead of entering card details on the purchaser's site, in this system the payment gateway allows one to specify which bank they wish to pay from. Then the user is redirected to the bank's website, where one can authenticate oneself and then approve the payment. Typically there will also be some form of two-factor authentication. It is typically seen as being safer than using credit cards, as it is much more difficult for hackers to gain login credentials compared to credit card numbers. For many eCommerce merchants, offering an option for customers to pay with the cash in their bank account reduces cart abandonment as it enables a way to complete a transaction without credit cards. =Mobile money wallets= In developing countries, many people don't have access to banking facilities, especially in tier II and tier III cities. Taking the example of India, there are more mobile phone users than there are people with active bank accounts. Telecom operators, in such locations, have started offering mobile money wallets which allow adding funds easily through their existing mobile subscription number, by visiting physical recharge points close to their homes and offices and converting their cash into mobile wallet currency. This can be used for online transaction and eCommerce purchases.

Two Union armies led by Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman maneuvered to draw the Army of Tennessee (led by John Bell Hood) away from their defenses at Atlanta, Georgia, so it could be destroyed. Although Hood's army was not destroyed, the city of Atlanta was abandoned and then occupied by Union troops. The fall of Atlanta also had far-reaching political as well as military effects on the course of the war. Background In several previous raids during the campaign, Sherman had successfully (but temporarily) cut Confederate Gen. John Bell Hood's supply lines by using small detachments, but the Confederates had always quickly repaired the damage. Late in August 1864, Sherman believed that if he could completely sever Hood's supply line Macon & Western and the Atlanta & West Point Railroads‚Äîthe Confederates would be forced to evacuate Atlanta. Therefore, Sherman elected to move six out of his seven infantry corps against the Confederate supply lines. The Union army began pulling out of its positions on August 25 to hit the railroad between the towns of Rough and Ready and Jonesborough. To counter this move, Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee and two Confederate corps‚ÄîHardee and SD Lee‚Äîwere sent south to Lovejoy Station to halt and if possible rout the Union troops. However, Hood failed to realize most of Sherman's army was approaching there in force, causing Hardee and his command to be highly outnumbered. Opposing forcesUnionConfederate=Battle Map of Jonesborough Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. =August 31= On August 31, Union Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard had two corps entrenched on the east side of the Flint River. John A. Logan's XV Corps dug in on high ground facing east and the Macon & Western Railroad. The XVI Corps, now led by Thomas E. G. Ransom formed a right angle connected to Logan's right facing south.City of Jonesboro: Battle of Jonesboro Frank Blair and the XVII Corps were in reserve west of the Flint River.map Hardee left Patrick Cleburne in command of his own corps while he directed the two-corps assault. Cleburne would move north on the left from Lovejoy Station and attack the Federal line held by Ransom, while Stephen D. Lee was to make the secondary attack on the right against Logan's line. Cleburne's lead division, led by Mark Lowrey, moved northwest, and just as it was turning north toward the Federal lines, Lowrey was unexpectedly hit by H. Judson Kilpatrick's dismounted cavalry, concealed behind fence rails and armed with Spencer repeating rifles. Kilpatrick's fire was so effective that Lowrey broke off from his attack against Ransom's main line and directed his entire division west against the Union cavalry. Lowrey succeeded in driving off the cavalry, but instead of returning to his original goal, he pressed the cavalry across the Flint River and was eventually stopped by Giles A. Smith's division from the XVII Corps west of the river.Bailey, p. 145. SD Lee mistook the firing between Lowry and Kilpatrick as the main assault and attacked well before Cleburne's troops had actually gone into action with Ransom. Lee ordered a frontal assault that was vigorously led by J. Patton Anderson. General Logan, from the Federal lines, admired Anderson's bravery in the battle before he was shot down.Bailey, p. 144. Lee's troops were repulsed with heavy casualties. After Lee's troops had been defeated, Hardee wished to renew the attack. However, Lee informed him his troops were in no condition to do so. Indeed, Lee had suffered a disproportionate 1,300 casualties to Cleburne's 400. Both were disproportionate to the Federal total of 179.Bailey, p. 146. Learning of Hardee's inability to dislodge Federal forces at Jonesborough and fearing a direct attack on Atlanta, Hood withdrew Lee's corps from Hardee's force that night and into the city's defenses, a move that would have great consequences the following morning when fighting resumed. Hood later described the fighting on August 31 as a \\"disgraceful effort\\" because the number of Confederate dead was minimal compared to the forces engaged.Bailey, p. 147. =September 1= General Absalom Baird The next day, September 1, Sherman brought up the XIV Corps, now led by Jefferson C. Davis, for an assault on the Confederate lines north of Jonesborough. Much of the morning, however, was spent bringing up further Union reinforcements. Sherman was particularly concerned about bringing into line David S. Stanley's IV Corps, which was busy destroying the Macon & Western Railroad near Rough and Ready. During the night, Hardee entrenched his lone corps in a north-south defensive line parallel to the Macon & Western Railroad with Cheatham's Division on the left, Bate's Division commanded by MG John C. Brown in the center, and Cleburne's Division on the right, wrapping around to the east, forming a salient centered on the railroad. map By 4:00 p.m. Stanley's corps still had not yet arrived on the battlefield, and Sherman ordered Davis to make an attack on a Confederate salient held by Cleburne. The apex of the salient was held by Daniel Govan's brigade. Davis made an initial attack, led by a brigade of U.S. Regulars, which was easily repulsed. Next, he positioned all three of his divisions for an assault. Absalom Baird was in the center, with James D. Morgan on the left and William P. Carlin on the right.Bailey, p. 151. John A. Logan's XV Corps also moved up on Davis's right. Baird personally led a bayonet charge, which earned him the Medal of Honor. The Confederates held on tenaciously, but after hand-to-hand combat Baird's men broke through, capturing Govan and 600 of his men.Bailey, p. 150. Davis's men poured through the breach while Stanley's corps finally arrived on Davis's left. Despite the overwhelming force of the Federal attack, Hardee managed to push three reserve brigades‚ÄîVaughn, Lewis, Gist‚Äîforward to the northern salient, blunting the Federal's penetration of the Confederate line. Vaughn slammed directly into the breach, plugging the gap. And, Lewis and Gist extended the northern Confederate line east to protect the far right, preventing the Federal Infantry from rolling up the Confederate line and destroying the entire Corps. Historians debate whether exceptional generalship by Hardee or the onset of darkness saved the Confederate Corps. Whichever, the remains of Hardee's Corps managed to retreat south in good order to Lovejoy Station. On the night of September 1, Hood evacuated Atlanta and ordered that the 81 rail cars filled with ammunition and other military supplies be destroyed. The resulting fire and explosions were heard for miles. Union troops under the command of Gen. Henry W. Slocum occupied Atlanta on September 2.Garrett, Atlanta and Environs, pp 433-634 But, Hood managed to escape Atlanta with the remains of the Confederate Army of Tennessee in good order and slip past Federal forces at Jonesborough en route to Lovejoy Station where they encamped during the month of September. That night Hood ordered the evacuation of Atlanta. The Union forces did succeed in cutting Hood's supply lines, but they had failed to annihilate Hardee's command. Sherman would finally occupy Atlanta the following day on September 2. This had been one of his major goals in the campaign. Aftermath The Battle of Jonesborough was the final battle of the Atlanta Campaign, and it caused the besieged city of Atlanta to fall into Union hands. On September 4, 1864, General Sherman issued Special Field Order # 64. General Sherman announced to his troops that ‚ÄúThe army having accomplished its undertaking in the complete reduction and occupation of Atlanta will occupy the place and the country near it until a new campaign is planned in concert with the other grand armies of the United States.‚Äù O.R. Series 1 - Volume 38 (Part V) p 801 The capture of Atlanta greatly aided the re-election of Abraham Lincoln in November, and hastened the end of the war. Hood led his defeated army away from Atlanta and to the west, opening the way for Sherman's March to the Sea and resulting in the virtual destruction of his Army of Tennessee during the Franklin-Nashville Campaign. In 1872 many of the fallen soldiers were relocated and reburied in the Patrick R. Cleburne Confederate Cemetery.Georgia Building Authority, (1997). Patrick R. Cleburne Confederate Cemetery. Galileo. Retrieved (2010, September 1) In popular media The famous fire scenes in the 1939 American film Gone with the Wind depict the conflagration in Atlanta caused by the spreading of fires started when Hood ordered the destruction of military supplies and installations as he evacuated the city.

Lion. It is based on the 1925 burlesque stage play Number Seventeen by Joseph Jefferson Farjeon. It is about a group of criminals who committed a jewel robbery and hid their loot in an old house over a railway leading to the English Channel. The film's title is derived from the house's street number. An outsider stumbles onto this plot and intervenes with the help of a neighbour who is a police officer's daughter. Plot Detective Barton is searching for a necklace stolen by a gang of thieves. In the beginning, the gang is in a house in London, before going on the run. The film starts off with Detective Barton (John Stuart) arriving at a house marked for sale or rent. The door is unlocked and he wanders in. An unknown person with a candle is wandering about and a dead body is found. When confronted the mysterious person claims innocence of the murdered person. Barton (who introduces himself as Forsythe) asks the stranger what he has in his pockets (handkerchief, string, sausage, picture of a child, half a cigarette), before the shadow of a hand is shown reaching for a doorknob. The stranger (who later introduces himself as Ben) searches the body of the dead person and finds handcuffs and a gun which he takes. The detective returns from investigating the weird sound and finds the handcuffs which the stranger left on the ground. A person is seen to be crawling on the roof through shadows, who then falls through the roof. This is a woman called Miss Ackroyd (Ann Casson) who is revived and cries out for her father. She explains that her father went onto the roof and that they are next door in number 15. The bell tolls half past midnight and the dead body has disappeared. Three people arrive at the windswept house, Mr. Ackroyd (Henry Caine), Nora (Anne Grey) (who is deaf-mute) and a third person. Ben draws out the gun. Ben accidentally shoots the governor. Mr. Ackroyd draws out a gun and asks him to search the gentlemen, Ben and Miss Ackroyd. The telegram is revealed to Mr. Ackroyd. Sheldrake (Garry Marsh) gets the diamond necklace, which he has hidden in the upper portion of a toilet. Ben causes a commotion and is locked away with Sheldrake. The two hands of Sheldrake reach out and appear to strangle Ben who is only pretending to be knocked out. More members of the gang arrive. They suggest tying up Miss Ackroyd and 'Forsythe'. The three thieves all have to catch a train. However, one of the \\"thieves\\" is Miss Ackroyd's father‚Äîa police officer‚Äîwho locks away two of the thieves and frees Miss Ackroyd and Doyle. He opens the door where Ben is locked away with Sheldrake and gets into a fist fight with Sheldrake. The other man reveals himself as Sheldrake (the supposed 'corpse' from earlier) and frees the others. Miss Ackroyd and 'Forsythe' are tied up again. Nora reveals herself to be able to speak and says \\"I'm coming back\\". She comes back and frees Miss Ackroyd and Doyle. Miss Ackroyd faints but recovers. Nora returns to the basement to allay the suspicions of the other thieves and buy time for the rest to get away. They free Ben and Miss Ackroyd's father. The thieves arrive at the train yard, and board a freight train that is departing. The train says Deutsch-Englischer Fahrverkehr Ferry Service between Germany-Great Britain. The train departs with Ben aboard and he stumbles onto crates of wine. The thieves, after dispatching the conductor, go to the front of the train, shoot the fireman, and catch the Driver as he faints. 'Forsythe' failed to get on the train before it departed and commandeers a bus. Ben is revealed to have the necklace. Sheldrake discovers he doesn't have the diamond and the thieves fight each other. Sheldrake claims that 'Barton' a detective posing as a thief. A chase scene occurs on the train as the thieves go after Barton. Barton escapes and handcuffs Nora. The bus that 'Forsythe' is on races after the train. The thieves, realising the train is accelerating, try to find the brakes. They turn dials helplessly and notice the bus that 'Forsythe' is on. Pushing levers and turning dials does nothing, indeed, it only makes the train go faster, leaving the thieves unable to escape. At the dock, the ferry pulls up. As 'Forsythe' watches, the train hurtles through the dock, crashes into the train currently on the ferry at full speed, and pushes it out to sea, dragging the remaining cars into the ocean. People are rescued from the water. Henry Doyle tells Forsythe that he is posing as Detective Barton. But Forsythe is actually Detective Barton, who says to Doyle, \\"You can't be Barton because I am.\\" All of the thieves are apprehended by the police who are on the scene. Nora asks Barton, \\"What are you going to do about it?\\" Barton replied \\"You better come along with me.\\" Nora says \\"Where?\\" \\"To breakfast.\\" Barton says, and they laugh. Ben then reveals he has the diamond necklace. Cast * Leon M.

He told John Maxwell about it, but Maxwell said that Walter C. Mycroft had a different film for him to do: a filmed version of Joseph Farjeon's play Number Seventeen. Hitchcock was unhappy with this, as he considered the story to be too full of cliches and he wanted to do a version of John Van Druten's London Wall. The director Thomas Bentley who eventually got to do London Wall at the time, wanted to direct Number Seventeen.Spoto, 1999. p. 129 Hitchcock was assigned writer Rodney Ackland for the film, which was to be a comedy-oriented thriller. The film makes extensive use of miniature sets, including a model train, bus, and ferry. Though the opening credits confirm the picture's title is Number Seventeen, much of the promotional material (as per graphic above) and many databases refer to Number 17, which was its US title. In the Hitchcock/Truffaut book (Simon and Schuster, 1967), Hitchcock called the film \\"A disaster\\". Reception Many contemporary and modern critics, most of whom are unfamiliar with the film's comedy origins, have unfairly judged Number Seventeen as a failed attempt at serious drama. For instance, Variety wrote, \\"Like the play, the story is vague and, despite its intended eeriness, unconvincing. It is asking a lot of an audience‚Äîeven a picture one‚Äîto make them believe a woman accomplice of a band of thieves will fall in love at first sight with a detective and prevent his being done in by her associates.\\" The review noted that the climactic train crash scene was \\"very good, but not sufficient to make it anything but a program feature.\\" On its initial release, audiences reacted to Number Seventeen with confusion and disappointment. It is not often revived, but continues to garner generally negative reviews with critics from Rotten Tomatoes noting the film as, \\"highly entertaining but practically incomprehensible\\" and as an \\"unsatisfactory early tongue-in-cheek comedy/suspense yarn\\". In the Hitchcock/Truffaut book (see above), Fran√ßois Truffaut has a similar verdict, telling Hitchcock he had found the film \\"quite funny, but the story was rather confusing.\\" Copyright and home video status Number Seventeen, like all of Hitchcock's other British films, is copyrighted worldwide but has been heavily bootlegged on home video. Despite this, various licensed, restored releases have appeared on DVD, Blu-ray and video on demand services from Optimum in the UK, Lionsgate and Kino Lorber in the US, and others.

[.]examiner[.]com/article/rabbi-lapin-reveals-prosperity-secrets (URL blocked by Wikipedia) He was previously the founding rabbi of the Pacific Jewish Center in Venice, California, and the former head of Toward Tradition, the Commonwealth Loan Company and the Cascadia Business Institute. Lapin currently hosts a daily television program with his wife, Susan, and provides spiritual advice to people through his website.  Early life and education  Lapin was born on January 1, 1947, in Johannesburg, South Africa, to a family of Lithuanian Jewish descents. He was the eldest of four siblings. His father, A. H. Lapin, was the nephew of Rabbi Elya Lopian (1872‚Äì1970), and served as a prominent and outspoken Orthodox rabbi in Johannesburg and Cape Town. His father eventually established an Orthodox synagogue (Am Echad) in San Jose, California, after leaving South Africa in the 1970s. Lapin emigrated with his family from South Africa to the United States in the 1970s, and became a naturalized United States citizen in 1973. Prior to coming to the United States, he studied in Yeshivas in Gateshead and Jerusalem. Lapin has rabbinic ordination from three institutions: Gateshead Yeshiva (1969); Yeshiva Knesset Hezekiah in Israel (1972); and from Rabbi Jacob Ruderman in Baltimore, Maryland (1975). While in his early twenties he returned to South Africa and taught physics and Bible in Yeshiva College of South Africa. In order to finance his planned move to Israel, Lapin formed a company, \\"Lapin Marine Enterprises\\" to manufacture boats. When he made enough money to finance his plans, he sold the company and went to New York in 1973, planning to stay one month in the US and then move to Israel. Lapin had a change of heart, and instead of moving to Israel, he partnered with Rabbi Matis Weinberg, the son of a prominent rabbi in Baltimore, and started a yeshiva for high school and post-high school students in California, Kerem College, in Santa Clara, in 1976. His family re-located to Washington State in 1991 to develop Toward Tradition, and to host a nationally syndicated weekly radio show. Lapin has two brothers, David and Raphael, who are also Orthodox rabbis and have similar educational backgrounds. His sister is married to an American rabbi. Lapin's wife and business partner, Susan Lapin, is also an author and lecturer.  Professional career  Pacific Jewish Center = From 1976 until 1991 Lapin was the rabbi of the Pacific Jewish Center in Venice, California. During those years Lapin and Michael Medved helped to revitalize the synagogue, which viewed itself as functioning as part of the recent Baal teshuva movement. The Center is known for its outreach to unaffiliated and disconnected Jews, and the Shul remains the last of the synagogues built in Venice during the first part of the 20th century.Prayer Shawls, Flip-Flops Mingle at 'Shul on the Beach', by Rebecca Spence, Forward, September 26, 2007 Religion and Prime Time Television By Michael Suman, UCLA Center for Communication Policy, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997, p. 116 Due to its location in an eclectic neighborhood, worshippers who identify themselves from many different denominations are all welcomed, and attend services and other events.

Jewish liberalism = Lapin promotes conservative political principles, intermixed with traditional religious observance. Lapin was one of the Jewish voices in support of Mel Gibson's successful film The Passion of the Christ, and was a strong supporter of the efforts by Terri Schiavo's parents to keep their daughter alive. He is also a strong supporter of Pope Pius XII as a righteous gentile, a term he believes should be renamed \\"righteous Christian\\". Lapin has called the United States the most \\"Jewish-friendly\\" state in history because of its Christian heritage. He argues that it is better for Jews to promote shared Judeo-Christian values with the majority than promote solely Jewish values. He has also called secular liberalism a danger to Judeo-Christian values, and claimed that the Holocaust Memorial Museum presents anti-Christian propaganda; he says that the museum ignores, for example, the work of Corrie ten Boom's family in unconditionally saving Jews during World War II. Lapin has declared that the Anti-Defamation League and its allies are \\"dangerous organizations that are driving a wedge between American Jews and Christians\\". Referring to ADL national director Abraham Foxman, Lapin claimed that by calling The Passion of the Christ anti-Semitic, \\"what he is saying is that the only way (for Christians) to escape the wrath of Foxman is to repudiate (their own) faith\\". Lapin also rejects the idea that the Jewish left represents Judaism. He has excoriated Jewish liberals for their promotion of ideas he views as contrary to traditional Judaism, such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and socialism. He argues that Jewish-born liberals have redefined \\"Judaism\\" to mean \\"liberalism\\" - and redefined \\"anti-liberalism\\" as \\"anti-Semitism\\". Lapin has said: \\"It is time for us to recognize the charge of anti-Semitism for what it often is: a political weapon intended to silence critics of liberalism.\\" = Public celebration of Christmas = Lapin has spoken against the secularization of Christmas, saying that, \\"We see obsequious regard for faiths like Judaism and even Islam, while Christianity is treated with contempt\\". He is opposed to replacing the \\"Merry Christmas\\" greeting with \\"Happy Holidays\\", saying, \\"Let us all go out of our way to wish our many wonderful Christian friends a very merry Christmas ... Nationwide, Christmas Nativity scenes are banned from city halls and shopping malls, but Chanukah menorahs are permitted.\\"Lapin, Daniel (November 24, 2005) Merry Christmas is Not Offensive ‚Äì Jews Should Protect Religious Freedom for Everyone. Orthodoxy Today Retrieved 2009-12-22 = Wealth = Lapin asks: \\"Does God want people to be rich?\\" ... \\"Yes!\\", he says, because God \\"wants us to be obsessively preoccupied by one another's needs\\", a habit that the commerce relationship fosters. \\"Wealth is a consequence of doing the right thing\\", he says. He argues that the Torah supports the free market and opposes punitive taxation, and wants people to pass on assets to their descendants, rather than being taken by the government by inheritance taxes.  Awards and recognition  Lapin has received endorsements from Dave Ramsey, Dr. Kenneth L. Hutcherson, Dr. James Dobson, Dr. Pat Robertson, and Zig Ziglar. In 1998, he was recognized by Seattle Magazine as one of the \\"Four Faces of Faith\\" and featured in an article that included three other religious leaders. In 2007, he was named by Newsweek as one of the top 50 rabbis in America.  Links to Jack Abramoff  Lapin has been linked to the scandal of Jack Abramoff through his organization Toward Tradition. From the early 1990s until 2004, Abramoff was a board member of the organization, which required its board members to contribute at least $10,000 per year to the organization, and served a few terms as Chairman of the Board. Abramoff met his contribution one year by donating $10,000 from the Capital Athletic Foundation, an organization Abramoff controlled. E-mails later surfaced that were alleged to have been sent between Lapin and Abramoff. In these e-mails, Abramoff requests that Lapin create fake awards for Talmudic studies to help Abramoff gain admittance to the Cosmos Club in Washington, D. C. Lapin later released a formal statement denying having given any awards to Abramoff, and stated that he was joking in the e-mails and believed that Abramoff was as well.Curtius, Mary. \\"A Lobbyist's E-Mail Train of Billing, Status, Charity.\\" The Los Angeles Times.

It is the partially hydrogenated form of harmine.  Occurrence in nature  Various plants contain harmaline including Peganum harmala (Syrian rue) as well as the hallucinogenic beverage ayahuasca, which is traditionally brewed using Banisteriopsis caapi. Present at 3% by dry weight, the harmala alkaloids may be extracted from the Syrian rue seeds.  Effects  Harmaline is a central nervous system stimulant and a \\"reversible inhibitor of MAO-A (RIMA)\\". This means that the risk of a hypertensive crisis, a dangerous high blood pressure crisis from eating tyramine-rich foods such as cheese, is likely lower with harmaline than with irreversible MAOIs such as phenelzine. Harmaline and harmine fluoresce under ultraviolet light. These three extractions indicate that the middle one has a higher concentration of the two compounds. The harmala alkaloids are psychoactive in humans. Harmaline is shown to act as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Harmaline also stimulates striatal dopamine release in rats at very high dose levels. Since harmaline is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A, it could, in theory, induce both serotonin syndrome and hypertensive crises in combination with tyramine, serotonergics, catecholaminergics drugs or prodrugs. Harmaline- containing plants and tryptamine-containing plants are used in ayahuasca brews. The inhibitory effects on monoamine oxidase allows dimethyltryptamine (DMT), the psychoactively prominent chemical in the mixture, to bypass the extensive first-pass metabolism it undergoes upon ingestion; allowing a psychologically active quantity of the chemical to exist in the brain for a perceivable period of time. Harmaline forces the anabolic metabolism of serotonin into normelatonin or n-acetylserotonin, and then to melatonin, the body's principal sleep-regulating hormone and a powerful antioxidant. United States Patent Number 5591738 describes a method for treating various chemical dependencies via the administration of harmaline and or other beta-carbolines. A study has reported the antiviral activity of Harmaline against Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) by inhibiting immediate early transcription of the virus at noncytotoxic concentration. Harmaline is known to act as a histamine N-methyltransferase inhibitor. This explains how harmaline elicits its wakefulness-promoting effects. Legal statusAustralia= Harmala alkaloids are considered Schedule 9 prohibited substances under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities. = Canada = Harmaline and Harmalol are considered Schedule III controlled substances by the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

Interactive software includes commonly used programs, such as word processors or spreadsheet applications. By comparison, non-interactive programs operate without user intervention; examples of these include compilers and batch processing applications that are pre-programmed to run independently. Interactive computing focuses on real-time interaction (\\"dialog\\") between the computer and the operator, and the technologies that enable them. If the response of the computer system is complex enough, it is said that the system is conducting social interaction; some systems try to achieve this through the implementation of social interfaces. The nature of interactive computing as well as its impact on users, are studied extensively in the field of computer interaction.  History of interactive computing systems  Ivan Sutherland is considered the father of interactive computing for his work on Sketchpad, the interactive display graphics program he developed in 1963. He later worked at the ARPA Information Processing Techniques Office under the direction of J. C. R. Licklider. There he facilitated ARPA's research grant to Douglas Engelbart for developing the NLSAbout NLS/Augment, Douglas Engelbart Institute system at SRI, based on his visionary manifesto published in a 1962 report,Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework (1962), Douglas Engelbart Institute in which Engelbart envisioned interactive computing as a vehicle for user interaction with computers, with each other, and with their knowledge, all in a vast virtual information space. In a 1965 report,Computer-Aided Display Control (1965), Douglas C. Engelbart Engelbart published his early experiments with pointing devices, including the computer mouse, for composing and editing on interactive display workstations. Engelbart's work on interactive computing at SRI migrated directly to Xerox PARC, from there to Apple, and out into the mainstream. Thus, the tree of evolution for interactive computing generally traces back to Engelbart's lab at SRI. In December 2008, on the 40th anniversary of his 1968 demo, SRI sponsored a public commemorative event in his honor.Engelbart and the Dawn of Interactive Computing, Douglas Engelbart Institute  Current research  HP Sprout, a projector-camera interactive computing system.

The film was adapted by Hitchcock, his wife Alma Reville, and Val Valentine from the novel by Dale Collins. The title is an allusion to words of Ariel's song \\"Full fathom five\\" in Shakespeare's The Tempest.  Plot  A couple, Fred (Henry Kendall) and Emily Hill (Joan Barry), living a mundane middle-class life in London, receive a letter informing them that an uncle will give them, as an advance against their future inheritance, as much money as they need to enjoy themselves in the present. Immediately Fred quits his job as a clerk and they leave on a cruise for \\"the Orient\\". Fred quickly shows his susceptibility to sea-sickness while crossing the English Channel. In Paris, both are scandalised by the Folies Berg√®re. As they cruise the Mediterranean, Fred's sea-sickness keeps him in bed. During this time, Emily begins a relationship with a Commander Gordon (Percy Marmont), a dapper, popular bachelor. Finally feeling well enough to appear on deck, Fred is immediately smitten with a German \\"princess\\" (Betty Amann), who hits him in the eye with the rope ring used to play deck tennis (a combination of tennis and quoits which was at the time widely played shipboard). Both begin spending their time on board with their new paramours to the virtual exclusion of each other, and each plans to dissolve the marriage. In Colombo, the couple accidentally and awkwardly end up next to each other in a rickshaw. When the passengers disembark at the final destination of Singapore, Emily leaves with Gordon for his home. When he reveals that the princess is a sham aiming to relieve Fred of his money, she realises she cannot go on with Gordon and returns to warn her husband. Fred does not believe her at first, but soon discovers his lover has absconded with ¬£1000 of his money to Rangoon. He learns that she was merely the daughter of a Berlin laundry owner and a common street walker. The couple have only enough money to clear their hotel bill and to book passage home to England on a tramp steamer. However, Fred and Emily's troubles have not ended, as the ship is abandoned after a collision in the fog. They are trapped in their cabin and prepare themselves for a watery end. In the morning, however, they awake to find the ship still afloat, and escape through a porthole. A Chinese junk arrives, and the crew proceed to loot the ship. When Fred and Emily board the junk, they are left unmolested and even fed. They finally return home, with their love for each other strengthened and seemingly wiser for their experiences. In the last scene, back home in London, the couple are seen arguing in a manner reminiscent of their bickering immediately prior to the arrival of the fateful letter. Cast *Henry Kendall as Fred Hill *Joan Barry as Emily Hill *Percy Marmont as Commander Gordon *Betty Amann as The Princess *Elsie Randolph as The Old Maid, a fellow ship's passenger who annoys everyone Production The film exhibits techniques developed by Hitchcock in his later films. Most notable are the shipboard sets, including a recreation of a full-size ship in a water tank. The director also experimented with camera techniques and shot compositions, most prominently in the film's innovative opening sequence, which shows city office workers leaving work at the end of the day. This dialogue-free scene was made on a specially-constructed set and filmed in a single continuous pan shot, and is followed by an extended comedic sequence depicting Fred's workaday travails as he travels home on the train. Reception Released during Hitchcock's period between The Lodger (1927) and his breakthrough hits The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) and The 39 Steps (1935), Rich and Strange was a failure at both the British and US box office. The film's lack of commercial and critical success is often attributed to the fact that there is dialogue for only about a quarter of the film, and that many features of silent films remain, including scene captions, exaggerated acting styles and heavy makeup. Hitchcock's experiment in pre-sound emotive performances over dialogue was possibly another contributing factor. An early scene of Fred leaving work for home via the London Underground is very reminiscent of Chaplin and highly dissimilar to typical Hitchcock staging. Copyright and home video status Rich and Strange, like all of Hitchcock's other British films, is copyrighted worldwide but has been heavily bootlegged on home video. Despite this, various licensed, restored releases have appeared on DVD from Optimum in the UK, Lionsgate in the US, and others.

Written by Hitchcock, his wife Alma Reville and Walter C. Mycroft, it is based on a novel called Enter Sir John by Clemence Dane and Helen Simpson. It was Hitchcock's third all-talkie film, after Blackmail and Juno and the Paycock. Plot In 1930, Diana Baring (Norah Baring), a young actress in a travelling theatre troupe, is found in a daze with blood on her clothes, standing by the murdered body of another young actress, Edna Druce. The poker used to commit the murder was at Diana's feet, but she has no memory of what happened during the minutes the crime was committed. The two young women were thought to have been rivals, and the police arrest her. Diana withholds some important information deliberately, to protect something about the identity of a man that she will not name. At her trial most of the jury are certain she is guilty. One or two feel that she may have a severe mental illness which meant that she really did have no memory of killing the other woman, but they are convinced that she should still be hanged lest she strike again. One juror, Sir John Menier (Herbert Marshall), a celebrated actor-manager, seems sure she must be innocent, but is brow-beaten into voting \\"guilty\\" along with the rest of the jury. Diana is imprisoned, and awaiting hanging. Sir John feels responsible, as he was the one who had recommended that Diana take the touring job in order for her to get more life experience. It also turns out that Diana has been a fan of his since childhood. She is beautiful, and seems far too honest and straightforward to be a criminal of any kind. Using skills he has learned in the theatre, Sir John investigates the murder with the help of the stage manager Ted Markham (Edward Chapman) and his wife Doucie (Phyllis Konstam). They narrow the possible suspects down to one male actor in the troupe, Handel Fane (Esme Percy), who often plays cross-dressing roles. During a prison visit with Baring, Sir John learns Fane's secret: he is a half-caste, only passing as white, and Druce threatened to expose him. Later, Sir John cunningly tries to lure a confession out of Fane, by asking him to audition for a new play that Sir John has written, on the subject of the murder. Fane realizes that they know he committed the crime, and that they understand how and why he did it. Fane leaves the audition without confessing, and goes back to his old job; he is a solo trapeze performer in a circus. Sir John and the others go there to confront him again. During his performance, from his high perch he looks down and sees them waiting. Despairing, he knots his access rope into a noose, slips it over his head and jumps to his death. Afterwards, Sir John and Markham discover Fane had written a confession to the murder before his suicide. We then see Diana, free, and gloriously dressed in white furs, entering a beautiful room and being welcomed warmly by Sir John, who receives her as if he loves her. The camera pulls back and we realise we are watching the very last scene of a new play, possibly the new play, in which Diana stars opposite Sir John. They kiss as the curtain falls.

It was originally to be released under the same title as the novel, Enter Sir John, but this was changed to the simpler Murder! during shooting.Yacowar p.240 A number of changes were made from the book, including altering the names of the two principal characters. The portrayal of the character Sir John Mernier was loosely based on that of the actor Gerald du Maurier, who was a friend of Hitchcock.Chandler p.80 Hitchcock later adapted three novels written by du Maurier's daughter Daphne du Maurier: Jamaica Inn, Rebecca and The Birds. Hitchcock makes his cameo appearance in the film as a man walking past the murder victim's house.Chandler p.80 The film's sets were designed by the art director John Mead. The German language version of the film, Mary, was shot simultaneously on the same set with German-speaking actors. Miles Mander reprised his role as Gordon Druce in Mary, though the character's name was changed to Gordon Moore. Music In addition to the original music composed by John Reynders, the film uses the opening of Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde prelude in a radio broadcast Sir John is listening to during the shaving scene. For the filming, an orchestra played the music live on the set. Hitchcock described the filming of this scene to Fran√ßois Truffaut in the book-length interview Hitchcock/Truffaut (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1967). In the early days of sound film, there was no way to post-dub sound, so Hitchcock had Herbert Marshall's voice recorded on a phonograph record, which was played back during the filming of the scene, while the orchestra played the \\"radio\\" music live.

The film stars Taimak, Vanity, Julius J. Carry III, Chris Murney, Keshia Knight Pulliam, and Faith Prince. Choreography was created by Lester Wilson and Lawrence Leritz. It was released in theatres by TriStar Pictures on March 22, 1985. The film was a financial success despite a mixed reception by critics, and is considered a cult classic.  Plot  Set in New York City, the movie follows a martial artist named Leroy Green (also known as \\"Bruce Leeroy\\"), who has dreams of becoming a great martial artist like his idol Bruce Lee. His master explains that he has reached the final level of martial arts accomplishment known as \\"The Last Dragon.\\" Martial artists who reach this final level are said to be able to concentrate such mystical energy into their hands that they begin to glow. Only a true martial arts master would be able to exhibit \\"The Glow\\" over his entire body. Leroy doesn't fully understand and, in possession of a medal supposedly belonging to Bruce Lee, Leroy embarks upon a spiritual journey to find Master Sum Dum Goy, whom his master claims can help Leroy unlock the power of \\"The Glow.\\" Another martial artist, Sho'nuff (also known as \\"The Shogun of Harlem\\") sees Leroy as the only obstacle to being acknowledged as the true master of martial arts. Leroy refuses to fight him and a furious Sho'nuff vows that he will defeat Leroy. Sho'nuff and his gang later break in and assault Johnny Yu, one of the students at Leroy's martial arts school, demanding that Leroy bow before Sho'nuff. Finally, Sho'nuff and his gang attempt to send a message to Leroy by destroying the Green family pizza restaurant. Meanwhile, video arcade mogul Eddie Arkadian sends his men to kidnap 7th Heaven VJ Laura Charles in the hopes of getting his girlfriend Angela Viracco's new music video featured on her show. The kidnap attempt is thwarted by Leroy who easily fends off the thugs. He loses his medal during the struggle, which Laura recovers. Later, Leroy witnesses Laura being kidnapped by Arkadian's brutish henchman Rock. A clue left behind reveals that the kidnappers work for Eddie Arkadian Productions. Laura refuses to promote Angela's video on her program, but as Arkadian's men prepare to coerce her by force, Leroy suddenly bursts into the room clothed as a Ninja and rescues Laura once again. Back at her apartment, Laura gratefully returns Leroy's medal. Consumed with vengeance, Arkadian hires Sho'nuff to defeat Leroy and takes control of the 7th Heaven studio, capturing Laura and Leroy's younger brother, Richie, who has snuck in hoping to woo Laura. Posing as a pizza delivery man, Leroy manages to infiltrate the assumed lair of Master Sum Dum Goy within a fortune cookie factory, but is shocked to discover that the \\"Master\\" is only a computer churning out cookie fortunes. Leroy consults his former master for answers, but his master suggests that Leroy has known the answers all along. Not wanting anyone to get hurt in the process of achieving her stardom, Angela leaves Arkadian and asks Johnny to warn Leroy about his plan. As Leroy returns to 7th Heaven, he is ambushed by an army of violent thugs hired by Arkadian. Leroy's students, led by Johnny, charge into the studio to even the odds. Using Laura as bait, Eddie lures Leroy to a dilapidated building where he finally faces off against Sho'nuff. During the battle, Sho'nuff reveals his ability to use \\"The Glow,\\" his hands pulsating with a red aura, and beats Leroy viciously before attempting to force him to acknowledge Sho'nuff as \\"The Master.\\" As recent events flash before Leroy's eyes, he realizes that his former Master was correct and that everything he needed to achieve the \\"Final Level\\" was within him all along. His entire body bathed in the sublime golden light of \\"The Glow,\\" Leroy uses his newfound power to defeat Sho'nuff.

It is named after the local River Derwent. The college itself is next to Heslington Hall, and close to the gazebo and gardens known collectively as The Quiet Place. History Derwent, alongside Langwith College is one of the founding colleges at the University of York. It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 22 October 1965. Following Langwith's move to the Heslington East campus in 2012 Derwent has taken its former buildings. Buildings and Services Derwent College has twelve accommodation blocks, named A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, M and P. Blocks A, B, C, D, J, K, M and P are standard university accommodation; they were built in the CLASP system, invented by Andrew Derbyshire, consisting of prefabricated concrete blocks and panels. Block A is part of the main college nucleus, being the north-west and north-east sides of a small quadrangle, with the administrative offices and JCR on the south-east. B Block is situated nearer Heslington Hall overlooking the University Lake. C and D Blocks are also located near Heslington Hall and also form a single separate building in most important respects. The original college only had A, B, and C blocks. Block D was added a few years later on a different floor plan with comparatively small individual rooms, but a large central kitchen and eating area. The older blocks had little communal space but somewhat larger rooms. Derwent College inherited the \\"Old Langwith\\" Blocks in 2012, when a new Langwith College was built on the Heslington East campus; blocks J, K, M and P are now part of the enlarged college. There were also a small group of rooms known as \\"N Block\\" (N standing for nucleus) which were situated above the main kitchen. Originally these were used for guest accommodation, however they have since been converted to offices. Derwent's E and F Blocks E, F, G and H Blocks are situated across the other side of University Road from the rest of the college, adjacent to Heslington Church field. They are more recently brick- build accommodation and some of these rooms offer en-suite bathroom facilities. Originally only two of these blocks belonged to Derwent, the other two were part of Langwith, prior to that college's move to the new East Campus, and collectively they were often referred to as \\"Derwith\\". Further to the main blocks, Derwent students are also accommodated in Eden's Court which is situated on Heslington Lane. Eden's Court comprises eight houses, each of nine or ten rooms with similar layout to those of Halifax College. There are also two cottages, Eden's Cottage and Sycamore Cottage. Eden's Court is jocularly referred to by the other blocks of Derwent as 'Shutter Island', due to its isolation in being situated nearer to Halifax College than the Derwent nucleus. Eden's Court was not always affiliated to Derwent and its residents, mostly mature students, belonged to a range of colleges. Facilities in Derwent include Computer Services classrooms and computer rooms, and the Derwent bar and dining room. During the day there is a main dining room, a snack bar and a drinks bar. Derwent College is home to the University's Politics, Education, English & Related Literature and School of PEP departments . College Staff The Head of College is a university academic who shares teaching duties with college responsibilities. The Head of College works with the Assistant Head of College, the College Administrator and the College Tutors. The current Head of College is Dr Eleanor Brown.

Student lifeStudent representation= All undergraduate students of Derwent College are members of the Junior Common room, and continue to remain members throughout their time at the university. The Junior Common Room Committee is responsible for representing the interests of Derwent students, organising events, and promoting student well-being. The committee is elected annually from the undergraduate population, and consists of around 40 members. All postgraduate students of Derwent College are members of the Graduate Common room, and continue to remain members throughout their time at the university. The Graduate Common Room Committee is responsible for representing the interests of Derwent students, organising events, and welfare provision. The committee is elected annually from the postgraduate population. =Events= Club D, a student club night on campus is organised through the Junior Common room. This is held periodically at weekends during term time in the Derwent bar and dining room. The college also holds the annual Big-D (formerly known as Derwent BBQ). It is an end of year event along the lines of Club D, but on a larger scale. Taking up the whole area in and around the college, it is normally held on the first Monday after exams and has several rooms of music, bars and food, and open air activities.

As of 2012, its wine is one of only four to receive the highest rank of Premier Grand Cru Class√© (A) status in the Classification of Saint-√âmilion wine, along with Ch√¢teau Ang√©lus, Ch√¢teau Ausone, and Ch√¢teau Pavie. The estate's second wine is named Le Petit Cheval. History In 1832, Ch√¢teau Figeac sold to M. Laussac-Fourcaud, including part of the narrow gravel ridge that runs through Figeac and neighboring vineyards and reaches Ch√¢teau P√©trus just over the border in Pomerol. This became Ch√¢teau Cheval Blanc which, in the International London and Paris Exhibitions in 1862 and 1867, won medals still prominent on its labels. The ch√¢teau remained in the family until 1998, when it was sold to Bernard Arnault, chairman of luxury goods group LVMH, and Belgian businessman Albert Fr√®re, with Pierre Lurton installed as estate manager, a constellation similar to that of the group's other chief property Ch√¢teau d'Yquem. LVMH acquired Arnault's share in 2009. Vineyard The vineyard is considered to have three qualities: one third Pomerol as it is located on the boundary, one third Graves as the soil is gravelly, and the remaining third typical Saint-√âmilion. The vineyard area is spread over , with planted with a composition of grape varieties of 57% Cabernet Franc, 40% Merlot, and small parcels of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon. The average annual production is 6000 cases of the Grand vin and 2500 cases of the second wine, Le Petit Cheval. Controversy The Ch√¢teau Cheval Blanc The manager of Ch√¢teau Cheval Blanc, Jacques Hebrard, was outraged at the evaluation of his 1981 vintage barrel samples made by influential wine critic Robert M. Parker, Jr. and asked him to re-taste. Upon arriving, Parker was attacked by Hebrard's dog as the manager stood idly by and watched. When Parker asked for a bandage to stop the bleeding from his leg, Parker says Hebrard instead gave him a copy of the offending newsletter. Hebrard denies that Parker was bleeding. However, Parker did retaste the wine and found it significantly changed from his previous evaluation; he therefore gave the wine an updated evaluation in a later issue of his publication The Wine Advocate. In popular culture The Rumpole of the Bailey Series 4 episode \\"Rumpole and the Blind Tasting\\" deals with a large shipment of Ch√¢teau Cheval Blanc found in the garage of a minor South London fence, a regular client of Rumpole's, with the fence claiming he had no idea how it got there. The wine later proved not to be Ch√¢teau Cheval Blanc but rather cheap plonk in used Ch√¢teau Cheval Blanc bottles, as part of a scheme to commit insurance fraud; the bottles were shown to have been planted in the fence's garage by the wine merchant who owned the bottles, with the intent of reporting the bottles as stolen in order to claim the large insurance payment from the total loss of the wine. The film Sideways features the Cheval Blanc 1961 vintage as a plot element, despite the main character's stated aversion to Merlot. Sean Connery drinks Ch√¢teau Cheval Blanc in the 1983 James Bond movie Never Say Never Again. In the 1990s film The Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult, after Frank is thrown in prison, he starts a prison riot in the cafeteria with a rousing speech complaining about the prisoners' accommodations, including, \\"This Chateau LeBlanc '68 is supposed to be served slightly chilled! This is room temperature!\\" The filmmakers slightly altered the name of the wine, fearing its owners would not want their product used in a spoof film. Restaurant critic Anton Ego, voiced by Peter O'Toole in the 2007 Disney film Ratatouille, orders a bottle of Cheval Blanc 1947 to accompany \\"some fresh, clear, well-seasoned perspective\\". In the 2008 film Bottle Shock, which tells the story of Chateau Montelena, actor Freddy Rodriguez, depicting Gustavo Brambila, correctly guesses the 1947 Cheval Blanc in a blind taste at a dare in a bar. In an episode of Frasier (season 5, episode 19 \\"Frasier Gotta Have It\\") Niles (played by David Hyde Pierce) asks \\"What kind of weak-willed man allows a woman to come between him and a 1981 Cheval Blanc?\\". In a 2008 novel by Jan Guillou, ‚ÄùMen inte om the g√§ller dit dotter‚Äù (‚ÄùBut Not If it Concerns Your Daughter‚Äù), Cheval Blanc 1982 is used as a recognition code between the protagonist Carl Hamilton and journalist Erik Ponti.

DeBarge is a younger brother of the members of the Motown family act DeBarge. He is best known for his 1986 hit single, \\"Talk to Me\\" and for his 1997 hit comeback album Long Time No See. BiographyRecording career= He began a musical career of his own with Motown in the mid-1980s. His debut self-titled album was released in 1986 and featured the hit single \\"Talk To Me\\" (#21 US, #7 R&B;). The album peaked at #90 on the Billboard 200 and released a follow-up single \\"The Girl Next Door\\" which charted on the R&B; chart. Two years later, he released a second album with Motown, Kiss Serious that included the hit R&B; single \\"Rainy Night\\" (#18 R&B;) plus \\"I've Been Watching You\\" (#43 R&B;) and the title track (#53 R&B;). However, he was imprisoned for drug charges not long after and served time in prison for drug trafficking. After his release in the mid-1990s, DeBarge returned to Motown to continue his musical career under the auspices of Kedar Massenberg and his neo-soul pioneering label imprint Kedar Entertainment. His third album Long Time No See was released in November 18, 1997 to critical acclaim and was preceded by the single \\"Iggin' Me\\" which garnered considerable airplay. The album would spawn three additional singles: \\"Love Still Good,\\" \\"No Guarantee\\" (a collaboration with Joe) (#18 R&B; Airplay) and \\"Virgin\\" (#97 R&B;). A non- album single \\"Soopaman Lover\\" followed in 1999 and peaked at #55 on the R&B; chart. His fourth album The Game was released on October 26, 1999 and peaked at #41 on the Billboard 200. The lead single \\"Give You What You Want (Fa Sure)\\" gave him one of his biggest hits (#71 US, #11 R&B;) to date, and had a remix featuring rapper Trina released. The follow-up single \\"Listen To Your Man\\" (reuniting him with R&B; singer Joe) peaked at #41 on the R&B; chart and at #33 on the R&B; Airplay Chart. A third single (which did not appear on the album), \\"Playa Hater\\" was released in 2000. He later moved to the independent record label, Koch Records, where he released 2003's Free (which peaked at #43 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart). It featured the single \\"Home Alone\\" which garnered some airplay. In 2005, DeBarge contributed a song to the Beauty Shop movie soundtrack called \\"Hard Times.\\" In 2008, Chico DeBarge appeared in the video for Joe's single, \\"We're Family\\" off the Welcome Home, Roscoe Jenkins soundtrack. His sixth studio album Addiction was released July 14, 2009 under Kedar Entertainment Group and included the single \\"Oh No\\" which peaked at #76 on the R&B; chart. On October 2, 2010, DeBarge performed with Glenn Jones, Lenny Williams and Regina Belle at the Performing Arts Center in Tampa, Florida. In March 2017, he announced he's at work on a new studio album in addition to doing some work on a forthcoming DeBarge family album due in 2018. In September 2017, he released his first new single in eight years called \\"Feel Good\\" featuring Jim Jones and Capone Noel. Additionally, his 2003 album Free was remastered and re-released (as Free Remastered) to include 6 additional tracks. =Personal life= In 2003, while touring in the Tyler Perry stage play Why Did I Get Married?, DeBarge was stabbed by South Philadelphia Italian mafioso John \\"Johnny Gongs\\" Casasanto, inside a Philadelphia nightclub, due to an altercation with one of his associates. The stab wound was within inches of his kidney and lungs. In 2007, DeBarge was arrested for drug possession in California and later went to rehab. In 2009, he admitted to addictions to heroin, cocaine and prescription medication and based his album, aptly titled Addiction, on his drug usage. On April 2, 2020, DeBarge's eldest son, Dontae (born 1984), was murdered from a stabbing incident in the Van Nuys area of Los Angeles, California at age 35.

A jump ball is a method used to begin or resume play in basketball. It is similar to a face-off in ice hockey and field lacrosse and a ball-up in Australian rules football. Two opposing players attempt to gain control of the ball after an official tosses it into the air between them. In the NBA, WNBA, and competitions operated by Euroleague Basketball, a jump ball occurs at the start of the game (called the opening tip or tip off), the start of any extra period, to settle special situations where penalties cancel out and neither team is previously entitled to the ball, and to settle any held balls. Held balls occur when two opposing players both lay equal claim to the ball, and after trying to wrestle it from each other, end up in a stalemate. A jump ball may also be called if there are different calls by two or more referees. However, most competitions other than the (W)NBA, and Euroleague Basketball (all entire game) use the alternating possession rule to settle all jump ball situations after the opening tip. This uses a possession arrow on the scorekeeper's table. Whenever such a jump ball situation occurs, possession of the ball is awarded to the team that is moving in the direction of the possession arrow on offense. The arrow then swaps to point to the other team. At the start of the game, the arrow points to the team that lost the opening tip. The alternating possession arrow rule went into effect in college basketball in 1981. Ever since, it has been controversial. Supporters of the possession arrow believe that jump balls give the team with taller players and better leapers an unfair advantage over the other, plus the possession arrow (especially in the NCAA Tournament) gives another element of strategy. But those who oppose the possession arrow believe that it has frequently undone a trailing team's defensive effort because it is the other team's turn to get the ball. FIBA, with recommendation by NCAA Men's Supervisor of Officials Hank Nichols, on the FIBA World Technical Commission at the time, adopted the alternating possession rule in 2003, with a major difference. In overtime periods, play begins with the arrow. In other organizations, another jump ball is conducted. FIBA mandated that ULEB, which operated the EuroLeague and Eurocup before handing responsibility to the Euroleague Company, adopt the FIBA rule in 2005, as part of FIBA's rules being used by the EuroLeague, effective the 2005-06 season. Previously, the EuroLeague used the NBA jump ball rules. However, the Euroleague Company reinstated the jump ball rule in 2013. Uniquely, 3x3, a formalized version of halfcourt three-on-three basketball overseen by FIBA, does not use a jump ball at any time in a game. Under current (2016) rules, the first possession is based on the result of a pregame coin toss; the winner can choose to have the first possession either at the start of the game or at the start of a potential overtime. During the game, held balls are automatically awarded to the defensive team.

The result was a 28-cylinder, four-row radial engine, each comprising a multiple-bank in-line engine with two cylinders in each bank, which, due to cooling concerns, were liquid cooled. Design and development One problem with scaling up any piston engine design is that eventually a point is reached where the crankshaft becomes a major engineering challenge. This was a problem that affected almost all engines of the class, including BMW's own 18-cylinder BMW 802 project. For the 803 the engineers decided to avoid this problem by simply not using a common crankshaft, and driving a set of independent contra-rotating propellers. The front engine drove the front propeller directly, while the rear engine drove a number of smaller shafts that passed between the cylinders of the front engine before being geared back together to drive the rear prop. This layout resulted in a rather large gearbox on the front of the engine, and the front engine needing an extended shaft to \\"clear\\" the gearbox. With no common crankshaft it became more practical for all of the accessories to be powered by one engine alone, in this case the rear engine. The supercharger itself used up several hundred horsepower, so the rear propeller delivered considerably less power than the front one. The 803 had two valves per cylinder and overhead camshafts. Displacing 83.6 litres, and using the same 156 mm bore and identical stroke measurements as each cylinder of the 801 used,Christopher, p. 83 the four-row 803 engine weighed 2,950 kg (6,490 lb) dry, and 4,130 kg (9,086 lb) fully loaded.Christopher, p. 83, puts it at with propellers. For all this weight it delivered 3,900 PS (3,847 hp; 2,868 kW). Although this made it the most powerful German engine design, its power-to-weight ratio was only about 0.98 kW/kg (0.60 hp/lb), comparing rather poorly with other large designs like the Junkers Jumo 222 at 1.7 kW/kg, the primary powerplant design for the advanced Bomber B design competition, which was designed to use only two engines of over 1,500 kW (2,000 hp) output. Specific power of the complex BMW 803 was likewise poor, at about 34.4 kW/l, compared to the 222's 40 kW/l, as was specific fuel consumption, at 380 g/kWh (0.63 lb/hp¬∑h), comparable to late generation turboprops. As with most coupled engines, like the earlier Daimler-Benz DB 606 and DB 610, the 803 was not a success on the test-bed, and did not enter production. About twelve prototypes were built. Aircraft projected for BMW 801/802/803 The engine was intended to be used only on the largest of designs, notably the Focke-Wulf Fw 238, the Focke-Wulf Ta 400 six- engined Amerikabomber design competition competitor, and other large bombers. The big, 6-BMW 801-engined Ta 400 was proposed in 1942 as an upgraded version of the never-produced Focke-Wulf Fw 300, and was meant to compete directly against the Messerschmitt Me 264, Junkers Ju 390, and by the timeframe of February 1943; what became Heinkel's Amerikabomber contract design, the Heinkel He 277 ‚Äî itself meant to be powered by only a quartet of 1,470 kW (1,973 hp) output BMW 801E radials from the start ‚Äî for the May 1942-approved Amerika Bomber contract, for a trans-Atlantic range strategic bomber designed to attack New York City from European bases. The projected range was enough for the round trip from France to New York, but it was of course never realized. The Focke-Wulf firm even intended to use the BMW 803 powerplant for single-seat fighter design, and it also appeared on several Blohm & Voss designs as well. None of these designs was particularly inspiring, and as the engine never matured the project was cancelled.  Survivors  A single example remains in the Deutsches Museum.

Goode had an 18-year professional career playing over 400 games and scoring over 4,000 points. He played professionally in England, France and South Africa featuring for Leicester Tigers, Saracens, Worcester Warriors, Wasps and Newcastle Falcons in England's Premiership Rugby, CA Brive in France's Top 14 and for Super Rugby's in South Africa. Goode represented 17 times between 2005 and 2009 scoring 107 points. Goode is the second highest scorer of all time in Premiership Rugby, having previously been the record holder. During his career he won five Premiership titles (1999-2002 and 2007) and two European Cups (2001 and 2002) all with Leicester; he also won the RFU Championship with Worcester Warriors. Early life Born 3 April 1980 in Coventry, Goode attended King Henry VIII School in Coventry and Bromsgrove School in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire. He started playing rugby union at the age of five at Barkers Butts, before moving to Nuneaton at 12. Up until then he had played at scrum half but soon found out he enjoyed the game better at fly-half. He also played for Warwickshire and the Midlands. He joined Coventry aged 16. In 1998 Goode was selected to play for England Schools U18 and has since represented England at U21 level, playing at the 2000 SANZAR tournament in New Zealand. Club career Goode joined Leicester Tigers as a youngster, despite his youth he played a substantial part in the Tigers‚Äô record four successive Premiership titles and also won two Heineken Cup winners‚Äô medals. Goode started the 2001 final and was an unused replacement in the 2002 final. He later moved to Saracens and after moved back to his old club Leicester in 2003. Goode was nominated for player of the Season 2004-5 and the PRA Players' Player of the Year. He also ended the season voted player of the year by the Leicester Tigers members and players and in March 2008, Goode became the all- time leading points scorer in the English Premiership, overtaking Jonny Wilkinson. Goode won his fifth Premiership medal in 2007, starting the final as Leicester defeated Gloucester. In the game Goode scored a try, three conversions and a penalty. Following Leicester's 07/08 season, Goode left Welford Road and signed for French club CA Brive. Goode had a very impressive start in the Top 14, scoring 235 points in his first season, making him the second highest point scorer in the 2008‚Äì09 Top 14 season. He spent the early part of 2010 on loan to South African Super 14 franchise, the Sharks. He made his Sharks debut off the bench against the Crusaders, but was sin-binned six minutes from full-time in this game following a head high tackle on Dan Carter. In February 2010, Goode signed with then English Premiership side Worcester Warriors. He joined the side in the summer, in preparation for the new season starting in September 2010. Goode scored a try, two conversions, a penalty and a drop-goal in leading Worcester Warriors to victory in the second leg of the Championship final against Cornish Pirates. This guaranteed promotion to the English Premiership for the 2011/2012 season. He returned to Welford Road in April 2012 for the match against Leicester Tigers but was sent off in the first half after hitting his old team Tom Croft high and late with his arm. Despite this performance, Andy Goode's consistent kicking performances were important in ensuring they ended the season above London Wasps and Newcastle Falcons. On 5 March 2013 it was announced that Goode would join London Wasps from the start of the 2013/2014 season. On 21 December 2014, in Wasps' first permanent home match at the Ricoh Arena in his home town of Coventry, Goode set a Premiership record of 33 points in a single match with 1 try, 2 conversions and 8 penalties, beating the joint record of 32 points set by Niall Woods and equalled by Dave Walder and Tim Stimpson, as Wasps beat London Irish 48-16. On 16 February 2015, it was announced Goode would join London Irish at the end of the season. However, on 8 September 2015, it was announced Goode would retire due to injury problems without playing a single game for London Irish and was therefore released from his contract. On 28 December 2015, after having his injuries treated with a botulinum toxin solution, Goode came out of retirement with the Newcastle Falcons for three months as injury cover for Mike Delaney and Ruki Tipuna. Goode's first outing in Newcastle colours was in an Aviva A League match against Leicester Tigers A on 4 January 2016. He made his last appearance for Newcastle on 27 March 2016 and retired for a second time. International career Goode played five times for England Saxons in 2001 and 2002. He has also played 17 times for England. Goode made his England d√©but as a replacement for Charlie Hodgson in the 2005 Six Nations victory over Italy, in which he also scored his first points from a conversion. Just before the 2009 Six Nations, Goode was called up to train with the England team and was subsequently named in the starting line-up for the match against . Goode went on to score the opening try of the 2009 Six Nations and converted it himself, ending the match with 16 points. While playing against Argentina Saturday, 6 June 2009 he scored 22 points against Argentina at Old Trafford. He then scored 17 points against them in the match in Salta.

Alongside Derwent College it was a founding college of the University, and is named after the nearby Langwith Common. History The front entrance of the old Langwith College site on Heslington West Langwith, alongside Derwent is one of the founding colleges at the University of York, and was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 22 October 1965. After having hosted Jimi Hendrix in 1967 however, the day to day history of Langwith College is largely undocumented, with much of the documentation from the early years being lost. The college has an ongoing appeal to its alumni for any help they can be to chart and illustrate the history of Langwith. One of the buildings in the former Langwith College (now Derwent L Block), Hendrix Hall, is named after the 1967 Jimi Hendrix visit. The room is a lecture theatre and multi-purpose event space. In 2003, the university set out plans to create a campus for 5,000 additional students, Heslington East. In 2012 Langwith moved to Heslington East and Derwent took over its previous buildings. Buildings and services Langwith College is split across four courts: Sydney Smith Court, Gordon and Francesca Horsfield Court, John West Taylor Court and Philip Brockbank Court; all of which are named after members of the University who have significantly contributed to student life. The new ¬£30m buildings house 650 students in a circular formation, and is home to both undergraduates and postgraduates. 'The Glasshouse' bar is located in the Langwith Centre Building and is managed by the Students' Union. Within the Centre Building is a launderette and a small study room, the 'Tom Lynch', for students. In October 2015, two new common rooms were built within the College, for students to relax and study in - the Corner Room and the Basement. The College is located nearby the brand new York Sports Village, which plays host to some of the best sports people across the University. Organisation and administration The College Principal is a university academic who shares teaching duties with college responsibilities. The Prinicpal is supported by the College Team, a team of full-time members of staff who have responsibility for community, welfare and day-to-day affairs. The incumbent Head is Jeremy Jacob. The College Team is supported by a team of part-time College Tutors, who are live- in students. The College Administrator manages the administrative affairs of the college. Student life Langwith has a strong rivalry with Derwent College. In 2015 Langwith was named as one of the top 50 halls in the UK. =Student representation= All undergraduate residents are members of the College Student Association, (formerly the Junior Common Room). Its committee is elected annually and is responsible for representing the interests of Langwith students. The committee consists of various roles and focuses on events, community and college activities. Although branded as a Student Association, Langwith retains a Graduate Common Room and a Senior Common Room Committee and therefore the SA plays the same role as a JCRC in the other colleges.

Mankiewicz and produced by Otto Lang. The screenplay by Michael Wilson was based on the book Operation Cicero (Original German: Der Fall Cicero) (1950) by Ludwig Carl Moyzisch, Nazi commercial attach√© at the German Embassy in Ankara (1943‚Äì44). In the film, James Mason plays Ulysses Diello (Cicero), the character based on Elyesa Bazna. The rest of the cast includes Danielle Darrieux, Michael Rennie, Herbert Berghof and Walter Hampden. The film is based on the true story of Albanian-born Elyesa Bazna, a spy who worked for the Nazis in 1943‚Äì44 while he was employed as valet to the British ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Montgomery Knatchbull-Hugessen. He used the code name \\"Cicero\\". He would photograph top-secret documents and turn the films over to Franz von Papen, the former German chancellor, at that time German ambassador in Ankara, via the intermediary Moyzisch. Plot In neutral Turkey in 1944, German ambassador Franz von Papen and his British counterpart Sir Frederic Taylor attend a reception. Von Papen encounters Countess Anna Staviska, who is a Frenchwoman and the widow of a pro-German Polish count. Now destitute, the countess volunteers to become a spy for a fee, but she is turned down. A man approaches a German embassy attach√©, Moyzisch, offering to provide von Papen with top-secret British documents for a price; ¬£20,000 British. What is not yet known by the Germans is that the man, Diello, is the personal valet to Sir Frederic as well as the former valet of the late count. The documents taken from Sir Frederic's safe and photographed prove genuine. Diello is given the code name \\"Cicero\\" and asked to continue his subterfuge. Diello gives his money to Anna for safekeeping and pays her a portion of it, provided he be allowed to use her new villa as a meeting place for his transactions. When the valet also tells Anna his dream of living in South America together, she slaps his face but she agrees to his conditions. Moyzisch is summoned to Berlin by SS General Kaltenbrunner suspicious of Cicero's true intent. Allied bombing of a Romanian oil refinery is carried out, exactly as Cicero's photographed documents had outlined. Colonel von Richter is sent to Ankara to take over the negotiations with Cicero, while the British send a counter-intelligence man, Colin Travers, to identify the spy. Anna's newly-found wealth and previous willingness to become a spy cause her to fall under suspicion from Travers, who also rigs the ambassador's safe with a burglar alarm. Von Richter requests a document detailing an Allied operation called \\"Overlord\\". It is the D-Day invasion plan and Cicero wants ¬£40,000 for it. Diello realises that he could soon be killed by one side or captured by the other. He decides to leave for South America, only to discover that Anna has stolen all of his money and departed to Switzerland instead. A letter arrives from her to Sir Frederic that identifies his valet as the spy being paid by the Germans. Diello breaks into the safe and photographs the D-Day plans and intercepts the letter but when returning the plans to the safe, he sets off the alarm and must flee. He now knows for certain how Anna feels toward him. Broke and on the run, Diello demands a ¬£100,000 payment from the Germans for the photographs of the D-Day plans. He receives it, then manages to avoid getting killed or captured. A second malicious letter from Anna to the Germans misinforms them that the valet is a British spy, whereupon they dispose of the D-Day information as unreliable. Diello escapes alone to Rio, where he is shown enjoying a new life of prosperity and freedom. Or at least he is until Brazilian authorities arrive to take him into custody because all of his money is counterfeit, from Operation Bernhard. Anna's money in Switzerland, he finds out, is fake as well, which offers him consolation in his new, dark circumstances.

Background  Cultural critic Alice Echols describes the emergence of a lesbian separatist movement as a response to homophobic sentiments expressed by feminist organizations like the National Organization for Women. Echols argues that \\"...the introduction of (homo)sex troubled many heterosexual feminists who had found in the women's movement a welcome respite from sexuality\\". Echols considered separatism as a lesbian strategy to untie lesbianism from sex so heterosexual women in the feminist movement felt more comfortable.Echols, Alice. \\"The Eruption of Difference\\", from Daring to be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967‚Äì1975, 1989, University of Minnesota Press, , p218. One of the earliest examples of feminist separatism was Cell 16, which was founded in 1968 by Roxanne Dunbar. Cultural historian Alice Echols credits Cell 16's work for \\"helping establishing the theoretical foundation for lesbian separatism.\\"Echols, Alice. Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967‚Äì75, University of Minnesota Press, 1990, , p.164 Echols cites Cell 16 as an example of heterosexual feminist separatism, as the group never advocated lesbianism as a political strategy. In No More Fun and Games, the organization's radical feminist periodical, members Roxanne Dunbar and Lisa Leghorn advised women to \\"separate from men who are not consciously working for female liberation.\\"Dunbar, Leghorn. \\"The Man's Problem\\", from No More Fun and Games, Nov 1969, quoted in Echols, 165 Instead, they advised periods of celibacy, rather than lesbian relationships, which they considered to be \\"nothing more than a personal solution.\\"  Meaning and purpose  Proponents of feminist separatism have varied opinions on the meaning of feminist and lesbian separatism; major debates include the degree to which women should separate from men, whether it is a strict ideology or a strategy, and how it works to benefit women. = General feminist separatism = In a tract on socialist feminism published in 1972, the Hyde Park Chapter of the Chicago Women's Liberation Union differentiated between separatism as an \\"ideological position\\" and as a \\"tactical position.\\"Chicago Women's Liberation Union, Hyde Park Chapter. Socialist Feminism: A Strategy for the Women's Movement, 1972 (booklet). In the same document, they further distinguished between separatism as \\"personal practice\\" and as \\"political position.\\" In lesbian feminist Marilyn Frye's (1978) essay Notes on Separatism and Power she posits female separatism as a strategy practiced by all women, at some point, and present in many feminist projects (one might cite women's refuges, electoral quotas or Women's Studies programmes). She argues that it is only when women practice it, self-consciously as separation from men, that it is treated with controversy (or as she suggests hysteria). Male separatism on the other hand (one might cite gentleman's clubs, labor unions, sports teams, the military and, more arguably, decision-making positions in general) is seen as quite a normal, even expedient phenomenon. Some feminist separatists believe that men cannot make positive contributions to the feminist movement and that even well-intentioned men replicate the dynamics of patriarchy.Sarah Hoagland, Lesbian Ethics: toward new value, p. 60, 154, 294. = Lesbian separatism = Charlotte Bunch, an early member of The Furies Collective, viewed separatism as a strategy, a \\"first step\\" period, or temporary withdrawal from mainstream activism to accomplish specific goals or enhance personal growth.Davis, Flora. Moving the Mountain: The Women's Movement in America since 1960, University of Illinois Press, 1999, , p271 In addition to advocating withdrawal from working, personal or casual relationships with men, The Furies recommended that lesbian separatists relate \\"only (with) women who cut their ties to male privilege\\"Bunch, Charlotte/The Furies Collective, \\"Lesbians in Revolt\\", in The Furies: Lesbian/Feminist Monthly, vol. 1, January 1972, pp.8‚Äì9 and suggest that \\"as long as women still benefit from heterosexuality, receive its privileges and security, they will at some point have to betray their sisters, especially Lesbian sisters who do not receive those benefits.\\" This was part of a larger idea that Bunch articulated in Learning from Lesbian Separatism (1976), that \\"in a male-supremacist society, heterosexuality is a political institution,\\"Bunch, Charlotte. Learning from Lesbian Separatism, Ms. Magazine, Nov. 1976 and the practice of separatism is a way to escape its domination. Separatism has been considered by lesbians as both a temporary strategy and as a lifelong practice. Lambda Award winning author Elana Dykewomon has chosen separatism as a lifelong practice. In her 1988 book, Lesbian Ethics: Toward New Value, lesbian philosopher Sarah Lucia Hoagland alludes to lesbian separatism's potential to encourage lesbians to develop healthy community ethics based on shared values. Hoagland articulates a distinction (originally noted by lesbian separatist author and anthologist, Julia Penelope) between a lesbian subculture and a lesbian community; membership in the subculture being \\"defined in negative terms by an external, hostile culture\\", and membership in the community being based on \\"the values we believe we can enact here\\".Hoagland, Sarah Lucia. Lesbian Ethics: Towards a New Value, Institute for Lesbian Studies, Palo Alto, Ca. Bette Tallen believes that lesbian separatism, unlike some other separatist movements, is \\"not about the establishment of an independent state, it is about the development of an autonomous self-identity and the creation of a strong solid lesbian community\\".Tallen, Bette S. Lesbian Separatism: A Historical and Comparative Perspective, in For Lesbians Only: A Separatist Anthology, Onlywomen Press, 1988, , p141 Lesbian historian Lillian Faderman describes the separatist impulses of lesbian feminism which created culture and cultural artifacts as \\"giving love between women greater visibility\\" in broader culture.Faderman, Lillian. Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers, Columbia University Press, , p220 Faderman also believes that lesbian feminists who acted to create separatist institutions did so to \\"bring their ideals about integrity, nurturing the needy, self-determination and equality of labor and rewards into all aspects of institution-building and economics\\".  Lesbian separatism and radical lesbianism  Separatist lesbianism is a type of feminist separatism specific to lesbians. Many lesbian separatists bought land so they could live separately from men and heterosexual women. Radical lesbianism and other similar movements represent a rupture with the broader feminist movements. They offer an attempt by some feminists and lesbians to try to reconcile what they see as inherent conflicts with the stated goals of feminism. Many of these conflicts and ruptures are a result of issues arising from broader and nationally specifically cultural narratives around women. Some of them are created independently in response to these needs, while others draw inspiration from radical movements in other countries. This results in no single history of radical lesbianism, but of separate national struggles. Internationally, radical lesbians often took advantage of convergent international spaces to create their own events to increase the visibility of lesbianism. Examples of this include the 1994 lesbian march in New York on the 25th anniversary of Stonewall. Another example was at the 1995 Beijing hosted World women's Conference. A third example took place during the 1997 Amsterdam hosted Gay Games. In the United States, the movement started in 1970, when seven women (including lesbian activist Del Martin) confronted the North Conference of Homophile Organizations about the relevance of the gay rights movement to the women within it. The delegates passed a resolution in favor of women's liberation, but Del Martin felt they had not done enough, and wrote \\"If That's All There Is,\\" an influential 1970 essay in which she decried gay rights organizations as sexist.Mark Blasius, Shane Phelan We are everywhere: a historical sourcebook in gay and lesbian politics, Routledge, 1997 p. 352Vern L. Bullough Before Stonewall: activists for gay and lesbian rights in historical context, Routledge, 2002 p. 160 The Furies formed a commune in 1971 open to lesbians only, where they put out a monthly newspaper called The Furies. The Furies consisted of twelve women, aged eighteen to twenty-eight, all feminists, all lesbians, all white, with three children among them.Dudley Clendinen, Adam Nagourney Out for Good: The Struggle to Build a Gay Rights Movement in America, Simon & Schuster, 2001 , p. 104 These activities continued into the early part of the decade.Bonnie Zimmerman Lesbian histories and cultures: an encyclopedia Garland Pub., 2000 , p. 322Penny A. Weiss, Marilyn Friedman Feminism and community, Temple University Press, 1995 p. 131 Other well known lesbian separatists groups include The Gutter Dykes, The Gorgons, and The Radicalesbians. In a United States context, the practice of lesbian separatism sometimes incorporates concepts related to queer nationalism and political lesbianism. Some individuals who identify as lesbian separatists are also associated with the practice of Dianic paganism.Empowering the Goddess Within , by Jessica AltonGoddesses and Witches: Liberation and Countercultural Feminism , by Rosemary Ruether In Francophone countries, the term radical lesbian movement is used instead of lesbian separatism. It is roughly analogous to English-language lesbian separatism. Inspired by the writings of philosopher Monique Wittig,Turcotte, Louise. (foreword) The Straight Mind and Other Essays, Monique Wittig, Beacon Press, 1992, , p ix the movement originated in France in the early 1980s, spreading soon after to the Canadian province of Quebec. Wittig, referencing the ideas of Simone de Beauvoir, challenges concepts of biological determinism, arguing that those in power construct sex difference and race difference for the purpose of masking conflicts of interest and maintaining domination.Hoagland, Sarah Lucia. Lesbian Ethics: Towards a New Value, Institute for Lesbian Studies, Palo Alto, Ca. She and her allies saw heterosociality as well as heterosexuality as aspects of hetero-power, strongly to be resisted.Claire Duchen, Feminism in France (1986) p. 23-4 Latin American radical lesbianism developed during the 1970s, and like other parts of the movement, resulted from specific national conditions. Radical lesbianism began to develop in Mexico in 1977, led by the group Mujeres guerreras que abren caminos y esparcen flores (Oikabeth). Radical lesbianism arose in Chile in 1984 in response to national conditions resulting from the dictatorship. Costa Rica developed a radical lesbianism movement in 1986. During the 1980s and 1990s, life for lesbians in Latin America was difficult because of lesbophobic repression across the region. Consequently, the communities in Mexico, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Argentina and Brazil began working more closely together on shared goals.  Culture and community  Lesbian and feminist separatism have inspired the creation of art and culture reflective of its visions of female-centered societies. An important and sustaining aspect of lesbian separatism was the building of alternative community through \\"creating organizations, institutions and social spaces ...women's bookstores, restaurants, publishing collectives, and softball leagues fostered a flourishing lesbian culture.\\"McGarry & Wasserman, Becoming Visible: An Illustrated History of Lesbian and Gay Life in Twentieth-Century America, Studio, , pp.187‚Äì188 = Writing = During the second-wave of feminism, women created a network of publications, presses, magazines, and periodicals, known as the women in print movement. Some designated their periodicals and books \\"for women only,\\" or \\"for lesbians only.\\"  Literature  One historical example is Charlotte Perkins Gilman's feminist novel Herland (1915). Contemporary examples include Joanna Russ's The Female Man (1975) and Nicola Griffith's Ammonite (1993). The Wanderground (Persephone Press, 1978), is a separatist utopian novel written from author Sally Miller Gearhart's personal experience in rural lesbian-separatist collectives. Wild Mares: My Lesbian Back-to-the-Land Life (University of Minnesota Press, 2018) documents author Dianna Hunter's experiences in a lesbian separatist collective. Lesbian Nation: The Feminist Solution (Simon & Schuster, 1973) is a collection of essays written by Jill Johnston, that were originally printed in The Village Voice, where Johnston discusses elements of breaking off from the male-dominated institutions.  Non-fiction  For Lesbians Only: A Separatist Anthology (Onlywomen Press, 1988), edited by Julia Penelope and Sarah Lucia Hoagland, is a collection of writings on lesbian separatism.  Periodicals  Notable US lesbian separatist periodicals include Common Lives/Lesbian Lives (Iowa, 1980‚Äì1996), Lesbian Connection (Michigan, 1974‚Äìpresent), Sinister Wisdom (California, 1976‚Äìpresent), Lesbian Tide (California, 1971‚Äì1980), WomanSpirit (Oregon, 1974‚Äì1984) Conditions (New York, 1976‚Äì1990), Azalea: A Magazine by Third World Lesbians (New York, 1971‚Äì1980) Other examples are the London lesbian magazine Gossip: A Journal of Lesbian Feminist Ethics, Lesbian Feminist Circle, a lesbian only journal collectively produced in Wellington, New Zealand,Covina 1975,pp 244‚Äì245. the Australian periodical Sage: The Separatist Age, Amazones d'Hier, Lesbiennes d'Aujourd'hui, produced for lesbians only in Montreal, Quebec,Warner 2002, p 179. and the Killer Dyke a magazine by the \\"Flippies\\" (Feminist Lesbian Intergalactic Party), based in Chicago. The Furies was an American newspaper by The Furies Collective which intended to give a voice to lesbian separatism, and ran from January 1972 until mid-1973. = Music = The early 1970s was an active period in womyn's music, a genre mostly originated and supported by lesbian separatists. Maxine Feldman's Angry Atthis and Alix Dobkin's Lavender Jane Loves Women were two early examples of this phenomenon.Garofalo, Reebee. Rockin' the Boat, South End Press, 1992, The Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, or \\"Michfest\\", was a yearly music festival that took place every summer until 2015. Michfest was established in 1976 and was active supporter in the need for women to be separated at times from the \\"politics, institution, and culture of men. Michfest offered women not only the chance to ‚Äòlive‚Äô feminism, but, as the quotes above testify, also acted as a way of educating women about feminist forms, in ways that can challenge the vilification of ‚Äòradical lesbian separatism‚Äô.\\" Olivia Records was a separatist business in Los Angeles that produced women's music and concerts. Olivia Records was founded in 1973 by Jennifer Woodhul, Lee Schwing, Ginny Berson, and Helaine Harris and was originally located in Washington, D.C.. Olivia Records sold nearly 2 million copies of albums with women performers and artists that were marketed to women. The record company eventually shifted from music to travel, and is now a lesbian travel company called Olivia. = Community projects = Womyn's land has been used in America to describe communities of lesbian separatists, normally living on a separate plot of land. Some lesbian lands have practiced the idea of ecofeminism on these separate plots of land, which is the connection between the oppression of women and the oppression of nature by men. Access to temporary free land was often found through women's music festivals, where lesbians would network and strategized their plans for lesbian land. Lesbian separatism provided opportunities to \\"live their lives apart from ...mainstream society\\",McGarry & Wasserman, Becoming Visible: An Illustrated History of Lesbian and Gay Life in Twentieth-Century America, Studio, , p190. and in the 1970s, \\"significant numbers of lesbian feminists moved to rural communities.\\"McGarry & Wasserman, Becoming Visible : An Illustrated History of Lesbian and Gay Life in Twentieth-Century America, Studio, , p187 One of these lesbians, Joyce Cheney, interviewed rural feminist separatists and lesbian separatists living in intentional community, land trusts and land co-ops. The result was her book, Lesbian Land (1976).Cheney, Joyce. Lesbian Land, Word Weavers Press, 1976Valentine, Gill. Contested Countryside Cultures: Otherness, Marginalisation, and Rurality ed.: Paul J. Cloke, Jo Little, Routledge, , pp109‚Äì110. Cheney describes the reason for many of these separatists' move to lesbian land as a \\"spatial strategy of distancing ...from mainstream society\\".  Reception  In a 1982 published conversation about black feminism and lesbian activism with her sister Beverly Smith, Barbara Smith, co-author of the Combahee River Collective Statement, expresses concerns that \\"to the extent that lesbians of color must struggle simultaneously against the racism of white women (as against sexism), separatism impedes the building of alliances with men of color\\". Smith writes that race places lesbians of color in a different relation to men as white lesbians as \\"white women with class privilege don't share oppression with white men. They're in a critical and antagonistic position whereas Black women and other women of color definitely share oppressed situations with men of their race\\".Smith, Barbara and Beverly Smith. 1983. \\"Across the Kitchen Table: A Sister-to- Sister Dialogue\\", anthologized in This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color, p121 Smith makes a distinction between the theory of separatism and the practice of separatism, stating that it is the way separatism has been practiced which has led to \\"an isolated, single-issued understanding and practice of politics, which ignores the range of oppressions that women experience\\".Smith, Barbara. Response to Adrienne Rich's Notes from Magazine: What does Separatism Mean?\\" from Sinister Wisdom, Issue 20, 1982 In 1983, anarchist Bob Black wrote: \\"Separatism may be absurd as a social program and riddled with inconsistencies (scarcely any separatists separate from patriarchal society to anything like the extent that, say, survivalists do ‚Äî and nobody intervenes more to mind other people‚Äôs business than separatists). But semi-isolation makes it easier to indoctrinate neophytes and shut out adverse evidence and argument, an insight radical feminists share with Moonies, Hare Krishna, and other cultists\\". While advocating a broadly separatist policy, feminist Sonia Johnson points out that feminist separatism risks defining itself by what it separates itself from, i.e. men.Johnson, Sonia (1989). Wildfire: Igniting the She/Volution. Lesbian poet Jewelle Gomez refers to her intertwined history with black men and heterosexual women in her essay Out of the Past and explains that \\"to break away from those who've been part of our survival is a leap that many women of color could never make\\".Gomez, Jewelle. Out of the Past, in David Deitcher's The Question of Equality:Lesbian and Gay Politics in America Since Stonewall, Scribner, 1995, , pp44‚Äì45.

As the founder of Path√© Fr√®res, its roots lie in 1896 Paris, France, when Path√© and his brothers, pioneered the development of the moving image. Path√© adopted the national emblem of France, the cockerel, as the trademark for his company. After the company, now called Compagnie G√©n√©rale des √âstablissements Path√© Fr√®res Phonographes & Cin√©matographes, invented the cinema newsreel with Path√©- Journal.R√®ge 2009, p. 124. Early life The son of a butcher shop owner, Charles Morand Path√© was born at Chevry-Cossigny, in the Seine-et-Marne d√©partement of France. His father, Jacques Path√© and mother, Th√©r√®se-√âm√©lie Kech were butchers by trade, and ran a delicatessen first in Chevry-Cossigny, and later in Vincennes. Charles had three brothers and two sisters. Business ventures Path√© left school at 14 to work as an apprentice butcher, at rue de Charenton, Paris. After military service, in 1889, at 25, he began working as a meat merchant but soon took his savings, and with the help of his brothers and his sister, embarked for Buenos Aires, Argentina, with the aim of setting up in business. Path√© tried to establish himself in various trades including a laundry service based on industrial washing machines that turned out to be unsuccessful. His life was unsettled and Path√© was forced to change jobs frequently. After a final failure of trying to deal in exotic parrots, when he and his business partner were stricken with yellow fever, Path√© returned to France in poor health. At age 30, Path√© married lle Foy in Paris, and worked as a clerk, drawing a meager salary. Sound recording Back in Vincennes, in August 1894, Path√© saw the phonograph invented by Thomas Edison, demonstrated at the town fair. He immediately embraced the sound recording technology, purchasing examples of Edison machines to resell. In 1896, with his brothers √âmile, Th√©ophile and Jacques, Path√© founded Soci√©t√© Path√© Fr√®res (Path√© Brothers) in Paris, a company that manufactured and sold phonographs and phonograph cylinders, with √âmile at his head. Charles Path√© and Ruth Roland at the signing of her contract in 1919 Cinema While in London, Path√© saw the Edison Kinetoscope and decided to expand the Path√© company's business to distributing cinema projection equipment, and with the acquisition of Eastman Kodak patent rights in Europe, a licence for film stock in theatres throughout France. Path√© films were rented out, for a maximum of four months, a more lucrative business than selling the product.Lanzoni 2004, p. 36. A modest first factory had been installed in 1896 at Vincennes. The first films of the Soci√©t√© Path√© Fr√®res such as Le Passage √† niveau √† Joinville le Pont and L'Arriv√©e d'un train en gare de Bel-Air were produced, under Path√©'s guidance. For several years, however, the success of the phonograph business underwrote the success of the cinema company. On 28 December 1897, Soci√©t√© Path√© Fr√®res was re-capitalised and set up as a combination of production, film laboratories, technical services and distribution of films. From 1902 to 1904, Path√© opened branches in Europe and in the United States, with their trademark Gallic cock logo created in 1905, recognized as heralding one of the world's most significant filmmakers. In 1906, Path√© Fr√®res began to establish a global enterprise with Segundo de Chom√≥n founded the Spanish branch in Barcelona, and four years later Path√© entered the US market with Path√©-America, based in New Jersey, branch offices in other countries followed. From its origin, Path√© Fr√®res began using the camera developed by Lumi√®re brothers' patents and then set about to design an improved studio camera and to make their own film stock. From 1901, Path√© teamed up with director and later manager Ferdinand Zecca who oversaw the creation and production of original Path√© Fr√®res films. From 1905 on, the company employed specialized studio staff: screenwriters, directors, cinematographers and other technicians. Zecca explored many themes from the mundane to the fantastic. In √Ä la conqu√™te de l'air (1901), a strange flying machine, called Fend-l'air, was seen flying over the rooftops of Belleville. By using trick photography, the one-minute short was notable in being the first aviation film, predating the flight by the Wright Brothers by two years.Paris 1995, p. 11. Zecca also pioneered one of the first crime dramas, Histoire d'un crime (1901), stylistically innovative in its use of superimposition. The story was of a man condemned to death, awaiting execution with his crimes appearing on his cell wall. The film is an early example of flashbacks as a film device.\\"The rise of French cinema.\\" brevestoriadelcinema. Retrieved: 1 January 2017. Other films included comedies, trick films or fairy tales, such as Les Sept ch√¢teaux du Diable, both 1901, and La Belle au bois dormant in 1902, as well as social dramas like Les Victimes de l'alcoolisme (1902), Au pays noir (1905) and reconstructions of actual events, the most famous being La Catastrophe de la Martinique (1902).Gordon 2002, p. 168. Zecca acted in many of his films. At the end of 1906, assisted by the Spaniard Segundo de Chom√≥n's photography and special effects, Zecca continued to experiment. He co-directed La Vie et la passion de J√©sus Christ (1903), which, at a running time of 44 minutes, was one of the first feature-length films about Jesus. He started filming in colour, with second Vie et Passion de N.S. J√©sus Christ, shot in four parts with 38 scenes, 990 metres long, which was finished in 1907.Gordon 2002, p. 167. Between 1900 and 1907, Zecca oversaw the production of hundreds of Path√© films from many important Path√© directors including Nonguet Lucien, Gaston Velle, Albert Capellani, Louis J. Gasnier, Andr√© Heuz√© and Henri Pouctal. Zecca also acted, directed, produced, and, on occasion, wrote films. After Path√© bought the rights to Star films, Zecca started editing films by George M√©li√®s. Film production went from 70 titles in 1901 to 500 in 1903; after 1906, the mass film production gradually eased as longer films were produced. Path√© Fr√®res filmed numerous short subjects, the majority of which are sensational criminal adventures, melodramatic love stories, and comedies. In 1909 Path√© produced his first feature or \\"long film,\\" Les Mis√©rables, a four-reel screen version of the novel by Victor Hugo. That same year he created the Path√© Gazette in France (called Path√© News in the U.S. set up in 1910 and in the U.K. (now British Path√©) in 1911), which was an internationally popular newsreel until 1956. .Austin 1996, p. 3. In 1912, Path√© appointed Alfred Machin to develop the first studio films at Sint- Jans-Molenbeek, Ch√¢teau Karreveld, Belgium. In 1914, Path√© Fr√®res studios in the United States released the first episodes of The Perils of Pauline, one of the earliest and best remembered screen serials. The company also began publishing the screen magazine Path√© Pictorial. When Path√© Exchange was spun off from its French parent company in 1921, with a controlling stake held by Merrill Lynch, Charles Path√© stayed on as a director of the American firm.Mira Wilkins, The History of Foreign Investment in the United States, 1914‚Äì1945, p. 89 In 1929, Charles Path√© sold out his interest in his businesses and retired to Monaco. He died there on Christmas Day 1957, one day before his 94th birthday. ReferencesNotesCitationsBibliography= * Austin, Guy. Contemporary French Cinema: An Introduction.

The inlet between it and the Isle of Palms is shown on early maps as Spence's Inlet, but is today called Dewees Inlet. The island is private, consisting only of residential properties and a wildlife preserve. It is accessible only by ferry or private boat.  History  Probably one of five original hunting islands of the Sewee Indians, the island was under British proprietorship until it was eventually owned by Thomas Cary in 1700. In 1702 he sold Sessions Island (now Capers Island) to William Capers and in 1706 he sold Bull Island to John Collins. Dewees Island was then known as Timicau Island, and somewhere between those two sales, Thomas Cary sold the island to Roger Player, where it passed through a succession of owners, including Arnoldus Vanderhorst. During that time, the island was known as Vanderhorst Island. Sometime after Vanderhorst's death in 1765, the island was conveyed to Cornelius Dewees, of Dutch origin, who changed the name to Dewees Island. Over time the island has been home to Indians, Revolutionary War soldiers, and Civil War blockades. It has a World War II submarine tower. Dewees Island residents during the 19th century were represented primarily as oystermen and farmers in census records. In the 19th century rice planters began farming on Dewees. Before 1898 land ownership on Dewees Island was complicated by wars, legal disputes and uncertainty. In 1898 John Murphy, a Charleston contractor and alderman, purchased land on the island and became the single owner. On the island Murphy grew artichokes, cane for chairs and raised pigs. Contracted workers harvested oysters and clams. Murphy owned a steamship, Undine, which he used to visit the island. A family (Huyler) lived on the island for much of 1925‚Äì52. According to the Dewees Island POA, \\"The island was purchased by RS Reynolds in 1956 and used as a hunting retreat. An investor partnership bought Dewees in 1972...\\" The first modern residential homes on Dewees were built in the 1980s on the south end of the island by the Royalls, Bobby Kennedy and others. After the island was devastated by hurricane Hugo, in 1989, the investors invited John Knott to consider further development, and \\"Island Preservation Partnership\\" was formed in 1991. With great sensitivity to \\"living in harmony with nature\\", the island was laid out to accommodate 150 building lots, and the infrastructure was put in place. In 1991 Knott, with the Royalls, R. Kennedy IV and others, formed an investment group aimed at developing and preserving the island. \\"Sales and building followed quickly,\\" according to the POA. The first new homes were built in the 1980s. The island was ceded to the owners in 2007 and has since been managed by the Property Owners Board and the Utility Board. In 2015, the island had 150 home sites and very strict building codes requiring a \\"small footprint and very little clearing of natural vegetation.\\" Information as to the sale of homes or lots was available from two agencies, Dewees Real Estate and Carolina One Real Estate and some were also listed on the Dewees Island POA organization web site. Home rentals were available and could be searched and booked on several web sites. The Community Center, with its full kitchen, included facilities for social and recreational functions as well as a pool and tennis courts. There were no restaurants or stores.  Transportation  The Dewees Islander passenger-only ferry runs between the Isle of Palms and Dewees Island, a 20-minute trip. Do note that the ferry is \\"private transportation for the owners, their families and guests, renters on the island and service providers. Everyone who rides the ferry must be pre-registered by an owner in order to be allowed entry to the island.\\" The primary mode of transportation on Dewees is electric golf carts; the use of gas-powered vehicles is prohibited, with exceptions for some work vehicles used for construction and maintenance.

The castle, together with the city walls, is considered to be one of Europe's most formidable medieval fortifications.Fehring, G√ºnther P. and Ress, Anton. Die Stadt N√ºrnberg. 2.

It represented the power and importance of the Holy Roman Empire and the outstanding role of the Imperial City of Nuremberg.Imperial Castle of Nuremberg, Bavarian Administration of State-Owned Palaces, Gardens and Lakes  Summary  In the Middle Ages, German kings (respectively Holy Roman Emperors after their coronation by the Pope) did not have a capital, but voyaged from one of their castles (Kaiserpfalz or Imperial castle) to the next. Thus, the castle at N√ºrnberg became an important imperial castle, and in the following centuries, all German kings and emperors stayed at the castle, most of whom on several occasions.Imperial Castle Nuremberg.

Ulrich Gro√ümann (translated by Margaret Marks): Nuremberg Imperial Palace. Verlag Schnell & Steiner, Regensburg 2006, This article is based on the two foregoing sources, unless indicated otherwise Nuremberg Castle comprises three sections: the Imperial castle (Kaiserburg), the former Burgraves' castle (Burggrafenburg), and the buildings erected by the Imperial City at the eastern site (Reichsst√§dtische Bauten). The first fortified buildings appear to have been erected around 1000.Alfons Baier: Zur Geschichte, Geologie und Hydrologie des Burgberges zu N√ºrnberg. (Kurzfassung - abstract), on the website of FAU ‚Äî Friedrich-Alexander Universit√§t Erlangen-N√ºrnberg Thereafter, three major construction periods may be distinguished: * the castle built under the Salian kings respectively Holy Roman Emperors (1027‚Äì1125); * a new castle built under the Hohenstaufen emperors (1138‚Äì1254); * reconstruction of the Palas as well as various modifications and additions in the late medieval centuries. The castle lost its importance after the Thirty Years' War (1618 to 1648). In the 19th century with its general interest in the medieval period, some modifications were added. During the Nazi period, in preparation of the Nuremberg party rally in 1936, it was \\"returned to its original state.\\" A few years later, during World War II and its air raids in 1944/1945, a large part of the castle was laid in ruins. It took some thirty years to complete the rebuilding and restoration to its present state.  Buildings  Imperial Castle = The usual access to the castle is via Burgstrasse ending in front of the sandstone ridge. A wide footpath leads into the outer courtyard through the Heavenly Gate (Himmelstor) situated next to the Hasenburg tower (named after the Bohemian Hasenburg family). The Sinwell Tower built in the 2nd half of the 13th century was the major keep of the Castle. It is named after its cylindrical form: in Middle High German sinwell means perfectly round. In the 1560s, its height was increased by a further floor and a pavilion roof with a pointed helm. The Deep Well (Tiefer Brunnen) inside the small half-timbered house in the middle of the courtyard is certainly as old as the castle itself, as it was the castle's only source of water. Its shaft reaches the water level in a depth of 50 meters (164 feet) and the water usually is 3 m (10 ft) deep. Above the water level, a niche was cut out of the rock for cleaning purposes. The lower stone walls of the building date from 1563. The little annex built in the following year was used as bathroom and changing room. The Deep Well provided sufficient quantities of water for normal consumption, but during Imperial Diets and visits by the Emperor, water barrels had to be transported on wagons from the city. The Castellan's House (Kastellansgeb√§ude), the Secretarial Building (Sekretariatsgeb√§ude) and the Finance Building (Finanzstadel) as well as the post-medieval Himmelsstallung are further buildings in the outer court, to a large extent reconstructed after World War II. The Inner Gate (Inneres Tor) leads to the Inner Courtyard (Innerer Burghof), surrounded by the Palas, the Imperial Chapel and the Kemenate. In the courtyard, remains of foundations of the Salian Period may be seen. In the middle, there is the Kunigunde Lime Tree planted in 1984, replacing older trees first mentioned in 1455 and named after Saint Cunigunde, consort of Emperor Henry II (Saint Henry). The Palas, the main building of the Imperial Castle, has two floors which were used for official functions and as the Emperors residence. It was rebuilt and modified a number of times during the castle's history. It now houses the permanent exhibition ¬ªEmperor ‚Äì Empire ‚Äì City. The Imperial Castle in Nuremberg¬´. Upper Chapel The Imperial Chapel (Kaiserkapelle), from an architectural point of view, is the most important building on the castle rock. It was built around 1200, at the same time as the original Palas. It is a romanesque double chapel consisting of two chapels one above the other and connected only through an opening in the ceiling, thus representing the hierarchical levels in the medieval society. The Heathens' Tower (Heidenturm) stands next to the Imperial Chapel. It was built at the same time as the Chapel. When the Castle was restored for the visit of Emperor Charles V, heathen idols and pictures on the tower were removed, meaning romanesque sculptures, and thus the tower's name in colloquial parlance subsists until today. The Kemenate (Ladies' Building) originally was built during the Hohenstaufen period, but later replaced by a large four storeyed building. The present building was burned down in 1945 and later reconstructed. At present, it houses the ticket office, the small museum shop and a multimedia show about the building history of the Imperial Castle. = Burgraves' Castle = The Burgraves' Castle was situated on the area between the Sinwell Tower and the Luginsland, but after its destruction in 1420 and the purchase of its remains by the city, very little is left. The Pentagonal Tower standing above the northern rock face is among the oldest buildings on the castle rock. It was the keep of the Burgraves' Castle. Its lower part made of ashlars may have been built at the same time as the Imperial Chapel. During later gothic times, a storey of brickwork was added. The Walburga Chapel appears to have been built shortly thereafter. It was originally dedicated to Saint Othmar, but after the city purchased the ruins of Burgraves' Castle, it was rebuilt and dedicated to Saint Walpurga. Destroyed in World War II, it was reconstructed and opened to the public in 1970. = Buildings erected by the Imperial City = The Luginsland (literally look into the land) was built in 1377 near the main gate of the Burgraves' castle, in order to enable the city to monitor the activities inside the Burgraves' Castle, at a time when the relations between the city and the Burgraves had already deteriorated. The Vestner Gate was the only exit from the castle to the north, at that time an open land. The Imperial Stables were built as a granary in 1494 to 1495 by Hans Beheim the Elder, Nuremberg's most important architect at that time. The ground floor was also used as stables. Severely damaged in World War II, it was renovated and is now a Youth Hostel. The Bastions were built in 1538 to 1545 in response to the progress in artillery which threatened the northern side of the castle. At about the same time, the fortifications of the city of Nuremberg as a whole were renewed and extended.  History  Pre-Salian and Salian period = Archeological excavations within the castle unearthed remnants of walls dated around 1000, and in deeper strata even older ones that may be attributed to a building of Henry of Schweinfurt.Birgit Friedel: N√ºrnberger Burg. Article of 4 October 2010 in: Historisches Lexikon Bayerns The first written record is of 1050, when Henry III issued the so-called Sigena document in Norenberc releasing a bondswoman.Document 253 in: Harry Bresslau und Paul Kehr: Die Urkunden der Deutschen K√∂nige und Kaiser. F√ºnfter Band: Die Urkunden Heinrichs III. Berlin 1931 (digitization by Monumenta Germaniae Historica) His father Conrad II, on voyages from Regensburg (Ratisbon) to Bamberg in 1025 and 1030, still had issued documentsDocument 30 in: Harry Bresslau unter Mitwirkung von H. Wibel und A. Hessel (Hrsg.): Diplomata 15: Die Urkunden Konrads II. (Conradi II. Diplomata) Mit Nachtr√§gen zu den Urkunden Heinrichs II.. Hannover 1909, p. 33‚Äì34 (digitization by Monumenta Germaniae Historica) in Megelendorf, a small village some 4 km further to the east where the river Pegnitz could be crossed by a ford (presently M√∂geldorf, a district of Nuremberg). In the customary way, these documents indicate the place and date of their issuance, but do not contain any reference to the type of the place (e.g. castle, village etc.). Henry III used the castle in his campaigns to extend his rule over Bohemia, Poland and Hungary. Henry IV, who had been the opponent of Pope Gregory VII in the Investiture Controversy, at the end of his reign, in 1105, had to endure that in his absence, after a siege lasting two months, the castle was taken by his son Henry V and that at the end of the same year he was forced by his son to abdicate. Upon the death of Henry V in 1125, the last member of the Salian dynasty, his elected successor Lothair of Supplinburg attempted to seize the crown lands from the Hohenstaufen Frederick II, Duke of Swabia and his brother Conrad who considered all these lands, including Nuremberg Castle, to be part of the Salian family property inherited by them. After several sieges, Lothair succeeded in October 1130 in capturing the castle. = Hohenstaufen period = Upon Lothair's death in 1137, the Hohenstaufen Conrad was elected King Conrad III in the subsequent year and soon afterwards started to build a new Imperial Castle which appears to have been completed unter his reign. The new buildings comprised the Palas, the Imperial Chapel and the Heathens' Tower. At about the same time, Conrad established the Burgraviate in order to ensure the safety of the castle in the absence of the king. Thus, the first burgraves from the Austrian House of Raabs built the Burgraves' Castle next to the Imperial Castle and were granted a substantial landholding in the vicinity. Frederick I (Barbarossa) used the castle for a number of Diets and receptions, e.g. of a legation from the Eastern Roman Empire in 1156, but according to recent research, he did not contribute to the building of the Palace. Henry VI apparently was engaged in various building activities related to the Palas, the Imperial Chapel and adjacent buildings. After the last count of Raabs had died, his son-in-law Frederick of Zollern, in 1192, was granted the Burgraviate by Emperor Henry VI. The Zollerns, soon renamed Hohenzollern, held it until the Burgraves' Castle was destroyed and afterwards its ruins sold to the city of Nuremberg in 1427 (the Hohenzollerns, however, continued to administer their landholdings outside of Nuremberg). Frederick II Frederick II, on the occasion of his first diet at the Imperial Castle in 1219, granted the Great Letter of Freedom (') to the city, including town rights, Imperial immediacy (Reichsfreiheit), the privilege to mint coins, and an independent customs policy, making the city an Imperial Free City subject only to the Emperor. Frederick II also transferred various responsibilities for the care of the Imperial Castle to the city. This was the starting point not only of a remarkable development of the city, but also of a long dispute between the city and the Burgraves.Michael Diefenbacher: N√ºrnberg, Reichsstadt: Politische und soziale Entwicklung. In: Historisches Lexikon Bayerns Frederick II stayed at the castle at least 16 times, and his son King Henry (VII) of Germany as many as 21 times. In 1224, on the first diet of thirteen year old King Henry (VII), Walther von der Vogelweide was on the guest list, and in 1225, Henry (VII) was married at the castle to Margaret of Babenberg, daughter of Duke Leopold VI of Austria. Frederick II made his last visit to Germany in 1236 and returned to Italy in 1237 for the remaining thirteen years of his life, leaving the German affairs to his son Conrad IV. = The Castle in the Late Middle Ages = The Interregnum ceased in 1273 with the election in Frankfurt of King Rudolf I, the first King of the Romans of the House of Habsburg. Immediately thereafter, Rudolf I attested a number of privileges to the Burgraves in consideration of their assistance in his election. Rudolf I held several diets at the Imperial Castle, and under his reign as well as under the reign of his successors Adolf of Nassau and Albert I of Habsburg, new buildings were added such as the Sinwell Tower, and works were executed on the Palas and the upper parts of the Chapel Tower (Heathens' Tower). During the same period, the Burgraves extended their adjacent castle.  The Burgraves' Castle  Both the Burgraves and the city improved their positions in the surrounding lands. The city of Nuremberg prospered and became one of the most important towns in Germany. The Golden Bull of 1356 named Nuremberg as the place of the first Imperial Diet of a newly elected ruler. The Burgraves' rise to power reached its climax when King Sigismund transferred the Margraviate of Brandenburg to the Hohenzollern in 1411. Thus, it was inevitable that the relations between the city and the Burgraves on the castle hill deteriorated significantly. In 1367, the city obstructed the Burgraves' access to the city by a wall in front of their castle, and in 1377, the city erected the Luginsland tower (literally look into the land) near the main gate of the Burgraves' castle, in order to control the activities inside the castle. In 1388/89, there was an armed conflict which was settled. Finally, the Burgraves' Castle was attacked in 1420 by Duke Louis VII of Bavaria and burned down, probably with the consent of the city. In 1422, Sigismund transferred the care of the Imperial Castle to the city, and in 1427, Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg sold the remains of the Burgraves' Castle to the city.  The Imperial Castle as part of the City  With the political and commercial rise of the city, the Imperial Castle became less attractive. Emperors started to execute their governmental acts in the town hall completed in 1340 and preferred to stay in the luxurious houses of the leading families rather than in the less comfortable castle. The castle continued to be used on important formal occasions. Frederick III appreciated the safety of the Castle and stayed there several months. The last king holding his first Imperial Diet in Nuremberg was his son Maximilian I. In 1491, he stayed at the castle for almost six months. His grandson and successor Charles V, because of epidemics raging at Nuremberg, relocated his first Imperial Diet to Worms. He visited Nuremberg only in 1541 on his way to the Imperial Diet in Regensburg. = Modern Era = At this time, in 1538 to 1545, bastions were built on the northern side of the castle to better protect it against an improved artillery, and the Castle was integrated in the renewed and improved fortifications of the city. The new fortifications were designed by the Maltese military engineer Antonio Falzon. The subsequent Habsburg emperors concentrated on their territories mainly in Austria, Bohemia and Hungary. Thus, Nuremberg was rarely visited any more by acting rulers. During the Thirty Years' War, in 1632, the armies of Gustavus Adolphus and Wallenstein appeared in front of the walled city, but were diminished less by their hostilities than by typhus and scurvy. Neither the city nor the Castle fully recovered from the effects of the Thirty Years' War. Since 1594, the Imperial Diet had met only in Regensburg. The Peace of Westphalia of 1648 not only ended the atrocities of the war, but led to the Perpetual Diet of Regensburg which from 1663 to 1806 seated in Regensburg. As a consequence, the Nuremberg Castle lost practically all of its importance and was left undisturbed by outside forces. In 1806, during Napoleon's restructuring of central Europe, French troops occupied Nuremberg and, according to the Treaty of the Confederation of the Rhine (Rheinbundakte), handed it over to Bavaria, then raised to a kingdom. In line with the Romantic Period's revived interest for medieval art and architecture, King Ludwig I of Bavaria, in 1833, ordered Carl Alexander Heideloff to execute restoration work, but the king was not pleased with his neo-Gothic style and stopped the work. His son Maximilian II later commissioned August von Voit to continue the refurbishment between 1852 and 1858 in a more moderate style. In the 1930s, the general opinion of 19th century art and architecture had deteriorated. During the Third Reich, Rudolf Esterer, director of the Bavarian Administration of State-Owned Palaces, Gardens and Lakes, removed most of the previous installations and returned the Castle to what was thought to be its original state. In World War II, the castle was damaged in 1944-45, with only the Imperial Chapel and the Sinwell Tower remaining entirely intact. After the war, the castle was restored under the direction of Rudolf Esterer and Julius Lincke to its historical form, including the Luginsland tower which had been completely destroyed. The Castle is owned by the state of Bavaria and administered by its Bavarian Administration of State-Owned Palaces, Gardens and Lakes (Bayerische Verwaltung der staatlichen Schl√∂sser, G√§rten und Seen).

Official website of the Vatican, accessed 21 May 2014. The preceding revision of the document was in 1614.\\"Exorcism - Revised rite\\" by John L. Allen, Jr., National Catholic Reporter, 1 September 2000 A slightly amended edition was issued in 2004. The document was originally issued only in Latin, but some versions in the vernacular are extant. Following the trends in Catholic approaches to alleged cases of possession since the pontificate of Leo XIII in the 19th century, the new revision includes a warning not to confuse mental illness with demonic possession. It also removes several descriptions of Satan, which sat uncomfortably with the Church's doctrine, and states that the devil is \\"a spirit without body, without colour and without odour.\\" Although taking many forms, Satan as a metaphysical or spiritual being exists without real physical attributes, but only the assumed forms. The 2004 edition contains two chapters and two appendices. Chapter One Title: The Rite of Major Exorcism This text is used for the formal ceremony of solemn exorcisms, which are always performed with the express permission of a bishop. It is for use only by mandated priest-exorcists. Chapter Two Title: Various texts which may be used ad lib as part of the rite. This Chapter is subdivided into three sections: a collection of nine psalms with concluding prayers; a collection of five Gospel readings; two pairs of deprecative and imperative formulae of exorcism. Appendix One Title: Prayers and exorcism for use in particular circumstances of the church. An introductory rubric states: The Devil and other demons can not only afflict persons (by temptation and vexation), but also places and objects, and can cause various forms of opposition and persecution of the Church. If the diocesan Bishop, in the particular circumstances, judges it opportune to announce meetings for the faithful to pray, under the guidance and direction of the priest, selected prayers and directives can be taken from the following pages. Appendix One contains the following liturgy: ‚Ä¢ A liturgical greeting. ‚Ä¢ An optional liturgy of the Word ‚Äì reading(s) and homily. ‚Ä¢ A collect addressed to the Holy Spirit. ‚Ä¢ Optionally, general intercessions concluding with the Lord‚Äôs Prayer. ‚Ä¢ A statement of purpose. ‚Ä¢ An extract from Psalm 68Note that this is indicated as Psalm 67 according to the Greek numbering customarily used in Catholic liturgical books. with congregational response. ‚Ä¢ The act of exorcism, first as an deprecative formula, then imperative. ‚Ä¢ The Sub tuum prayer and a slightly revised version of an exorcism prayer to St Michael. ‚Ä¢ A sprinkling with holy water, blessing and dismissal. Appendix Two Title: Prayers which may be used privately by the faithful in the struggle against the powers of darkness. Appendix Two contains the following (all in Latin): ‚Ä¢ Five collect- style prayers to God. ‚Ä¢ A short litany of invocations of the Holy Trinity. ‚Ä¢ A long litany of invocations of Jesus. ‚Ä¢ Short invocations to the Lord with the sign of the Cross. ‚Ä¢ Invocations of the Blessed Virgin Mary, including the Sub tuum and Memorare. ‚Ä¢ The well-known shorter Prayer to St Michael. ‚Ä¢ A short litany of saints.

Secondary effects were cooling of the engine and charge cooling. Higher boost was only effective at altitudes below the full- throttle height, where the supercharger could still provide additional boost pressure that was otherwise wasted, while the smaller secondary effects were useful even above that altitude. Composition MW 50 is something of a misnomer, as it is actually a mixture of three fluids: 50% methanol acting primarily to achieve optimum anti-detonant effect, secondarily as an anti- freeze; 49.5% water; and 0.5% Schutz√∂l 39, an oil-based anti-corrosion additive. The similar MW 30 increased the water to 69.5% and decreased methanol to 30%.Bridgeman 1989, p. 296. This increased the cooling performance but made it easier to freeze, the mixture intended to be used for lower- altitude missions. EW 30 and EW 50 mixtures also existed, which substituted methanol with ethanol; in emergency, pure water could be used. Effect The effect of MW 50 injection could be dramatic. Simply turning on the system allowed the engine to pull in more air due to the charge cooling effect, boosting performance by about on the BMW 801 and DB 605. However, the MW 50 also allowed the supercharger to be run at much higher boost levels as well, for a combined increase of . At sea level, this allowed the engine to run at over . MW 50 was fully effective up to about , above which it added only about 4% extra power, due largely to charge cooling. Time limits The increased power could be used for a maximum of 10 minutes at a time, much like the American war emergency power setting for their own aircraft, with at least five minutes between each application.Bridgeman 1989, p. 297. Aircraft generally carried enough MW 50 for about two ten-minute periods of use, allowing them to increase their climb rate and level speed in combat for interception missions. Applications Fittings for MW 50 first appeared on the BMW 801D in 1942, but it never went into production for this engine because the cylinder heads developed micro-cracks when MW 50 was used. Instead, the DB 605-engined later versions of the Messerschmitt Bf 109 were fitted with an MW 50 injection system, beginning in early 1944. Later engine designs all included the fittings as well, notably the Junkers Jumo 213, which relied on it to increase non-boosted performance and tune the supercharger for higher altitudes. Other systems MW 50 was not the only charge cooling system to be used by the Germans. Some engines dedicated to high altitude included an intercooler instead, as they would be needing the cooling for longer periods of time. The 801D also included the ability to spray gasoline into the supercharger (the Erh√∂hte Notleistung [Increased Emergency Performance] system), in place of the MW 50. While this was not as effective, it did increase boost without the complexity of the additional tanking and plumbing. Additionally, many of the late-war engines also included a system for high-altitude boost, GM-1, which was intended to add oxygen to the fuel/air mix by injecting nitrous oxide into the supercharger instead of employing higher boost levels ‚Äì the Jumo 213E inverted V12 on the Ta 152H could \\"sprint\\" with both boost systems engaged to airspeeds of well over at low altitudes.

In 2010, early clinical trials for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy have been completed. the drug is not approved for these indications in North America or Europe. It is approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) and was designated an orphan drug in 2007. Chemically, idebenone is an organic compound of the quinone family. It is also promoted commercially as a synthetic analog of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). UsesIndications that are or were approved in some territories=Nootropic effects and Alzheimer's disease Idebenone improved learning and memory in experiments with mice. In humans, evaluation of Surrogate endpoints like electroretinography, auditory evoked potentials and visual analogue scales also suggested positive nootropic effects, but larger studies with hard endpoints are missing. Research on idebenone as a potential therapy of Alzheimer's disease have been inconsistent, but there may be a trend for a slight benefit. In May 1998, the approval for this indication was cancelled in Japan due to the lack of proven effects. In some European countries, the drug is available for the treatment of individual patients in special cases. Friedreich's ataxia (Sovrima) Preliminary testing has been done in humans and found idebenone to be a safe treatment for Friedreich's ataxia (FA), exhibiting a positive effect on cardiac hypertrophy and neurological function. The latter was only significantly improved in young patients. In a different experiment, a one-year test on eight patients, idebenone reduced the rate of deterioration of cardiac function, but without halting the progression of ataxia. The drug was approved for FA in Canada in 2008 under conditions including proof of efficacy in further clinical trials. However, on February 27, 2013, Health Canada announced that idebenone would be voluntarily recalled as of April 30, 2013 by its Canadian manufacturer, Santhera Pharmaceuticals, due to the failure of the drug to show efficacy in the further clinical trials that were conducted.Voluntary Withdrawal of Catena from the Canadian Market In 2008, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) refused a marketing authorisation for this indication.

Santhera completed a Phase III clinical trial in this indication in Europe with positive results, and submitted an application to market the drug to European regulators in July 2011. It is approved by EMA for this indication and was designated an orphan drug in 2007. =Indications being explored=Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Catena) After experiments in mice and preliminary studies in humans, idebenone has entered Phase II clinical trials in 2005 and Phase III trials in 2009. Other neuromuscular diseases Phase I and II clinical trials for the treatment of MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis are ongoing . =Life style= Idebenone is claimed to have properties similar to CoQ10 in its antioxidant properties, and has therefore been used in anti-aging on the basis of free-radical theory. Clinical evidence for this use is missing. It has been used in topical applications to treat wrinkles. Pharmacology In cellular and tissue models, idebenone acts as a transporter in the electron transport chain of mitochondria and thus increases the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which is the main energy source for cells, and also inhibits lipoperoxide formation. Positive effects on the energy household of mitochondria has also been observed in animal models. Clinical relevance of these findings has not been established. =Pharmacokinetics= Idebenone is well absorbed from the gut but undergoes excessive first pass metabolism in the liver, so that less than 1% reach the circulation. This rate can be improved with special formulations (suspensions) of idebenone and by administering it together with fat food; but even taking these measures bioavailability still seems to be considerably less than 14% in humans. More than 99% of the circulating drug are bound to plasma proteins. Idebenone metabolites include glucuronides and sulfates, which are mainly (~80%) excreted via the urine.

Although promising at first, development dragged on and the project was eventually cancelled to concentrate on jet engines instead. Design and development Soon after the 801 entered testing, BMW engineers turned to building much larger versions. One idea was to bolt two 801's back to back. Although seemingly a simple concept, the resulting, 83.5 litre displacement BMW 803 was in fact fantastically complicated, while being of the same cylinder layout (four rows of seven cylinders apiece) as the largest-ever aircraft piston engine ever used by the Americans at any time, the 71.5 litre displacement Pratt & Whitney Wasp Major, the BMW 803 gave up on air cooling to be liquid-cooled instead. Another idea was to add more cylinders to the 801 design, and since radials need to have an odd number of cylinders per row, the next \\"size up\\" was a two-row 9-cylinder design, the 802, which emerged having an almost identical displacement to the American 18-cylinder Wright R-3350 Duplex Cyclone two-row air-cooled radial aviation engine - itself first run in May 1937, over two years before the outbreak of war in Europe - and just larger than the British Bristol Centaurus. One problem with the 801 was its poor altitude performance, due almost entirely to the single-stage two-speed, mechanically driven supercharger it used. Since the 802 was not a necessity given the success and emerging flexibility of the 801's basic design, the engineers decided to take the time needed to address this problem by including an improved two- stageChristopher, p. 81 three-speed supercharger. The lowest-speed setting would not \\"rob\\" as much power at low altitudes, allowing the engine to produce 2,600 PS (1,912 kW) for takeoff, and still produce 1,600 PS (1,176 kW) at . This was a dramatic improvement on the 801A's 1,600 PS (1,176 kW) for takeoff and 1,380 PS (1,015 kW) maximum at , especially notable considering the engine was less than 30% larger in displacement. In addition, airflow through the engine had been carefully managed by the BMW aviation powerplant engineering team ‚Äî via a forward cowl that seemed to owe much to the BMW-engineered, integral forward cowl design used for the 801 and its own forward cowl- contained oil cooling system ‚Äî to enable the straightest possible path into and out of the engine.Christopher, pp. 81‚Äì82 A twelve-blade fan (almost identical in appearance to the 801's own unit) and stator compressed incoming air, then fed into the supercharger; remaining air was channeled in three paths: through the intercooler and the front and rear cylinder baffles; all three streams rejoined behind the rearmost row of cylinders into the exhaust. The combination of the fan and ejector thrust from the exhaust balanced the total internal engine drag.Christopher, p. 82 The engine weighed , the same weight as the complex twinned Daimler-Benz DB 601s that comprised the troubled \\"DB 606\\" power systems, best known for powering the Heinkel He 177A heavy bomber, each of which generated some 2,700 PS (1,986 kW) at sea level for takeoff ‚Äî the American Wright Duplex-Cyclone, however, only weighed 1,212 kg (2,670 lb) for nearly the same displacement and engine configuration as the 802. The 802 was eventually projected to be capable of producing , a power level that the Duplex-Cyclone would equal and surpass in the post-war years, up to some 2,610 kW (3,500 hp) through a trio of power-recovery turbines per engine in their exhaust systems in later subtypes, mechanically connected to the Duplex-Cyclone's crankshaft. Development was still underway in late 1943 when BMW decided the project wasn't worthwhile. With their BMW 003 axial-flow turbojet engine finally maturing and considerably larger models of turbojet and even turboprop powerplants entering the prototype phase from both BMW and their competitors, it appeared that large piston engines weren't worth building. Postwar, the British scientific mission's leader, Sir Roy Fedden, called it \\"interesting and innovative\\" quoted in Christopher, p. 81 and considered it \\"one of the most interesting piston engines seen in Germany\\". A further improvement led to P.8011, which replaced the supercharger with two smaller turbochargers, driving contra-rotating propellers. This raised the takeoff power to about 2,800 PS (2,059 kW), (some report 2,900 PS (2,133 kW)) and dramatically improved altitude performance. As with most German turbocharger projects, the lack of quality high-temperature alloys meant the project was never able to enter production.

(True Sounds of Liberty) is an American punk rock band formed in 1978 in Long Beach, California.Strong, Martin C. (1999). The Great Alternative & Indie Discography, Canongate Books, page 663. . Although most commonly associated with hardcore punk, T.S.O.L.'s music has varied on each release, including such styles as deathrock, art punk, horror punk and other varieties of punk music. History Formed in 1978 in Long Beach, T.S.O.L. originated as a punk band, developing from earlier bands SS Cult and Johnny Koathanger and the Abortions. The original lineup consisted of vocalist Jack Grisham (who has been credited as Jack Greggors, Alex Morgon, Jack Ladoga, Jack Delauge and Jack Loyd, among pseudonyms), guitarist Ron Emory, bassist Mike Roche and drummer Todd Barnes. According to legend, the band acquired their instruments by casing a local music shop, waiting until closing, and then performing a smash-and-grab robbery. Later in 1978, Grisham and Barnes formed Vicious Circle, and T.S.O.L. took a brief hiatus (in 2013, TKO Records released an eponymous Vicious Circle EP, composed of circa-1979 rehearsal tapes). T.S.O.L.'s debut five-song EP, T.S.O.L., was released in spring 1981 by Posh Boy Records, featuring the reconvened original lineup. This first release was harshly political, featuring tracks such as \\"Superficial Love,\\" \\"World War III\\" and \\"Abolish Government.\\" Their first full-length album, Dance with Me, was released later in 1981 on Frontier Records, and showcased a more gothic/deathrock sound. They then signed to independent label Alternative Tentacles, releasing the Weathered Statues EP early in 1982, and the melodic Beneath the Shadows album later that year; the latter featured a new member, keyboardist Greg Kuehn. Amid personal turmoil, Grisham, Barnes and Kuehn all left the band in 1983. After his exit, Grisham formed Cathedral of Tears, who released a 1984 EP on Enigma Records, followed by Tender Fury, who issued three albums: Tender Fury (1988), Garden of Evil (1989) and If Anger Were Soul, Id Be James Brown (1991). T.S.O.L., however, chose to reconfigure. Bad Religion bassist Jay Bentley briefly joined in 1983 before Roche returned. Joe Wood (formerly of Der Stab, and Grisham's then-brother-in-law) and Mitch Dean joined on vocals and drums, respectively. This new lineup released three albums on Enigma: Change Today? (1984), Revenge (1986) and Hit and Run (1987). All three albums featured a more polished production style, with Hit and Run reaching No. 184 on the Billboard 200 charts, and the band toured globally to support the releases. The band's first live album, Live, was issued by Enigma in 1988. The band became friends with Guns N' Roses, and T.S.O.L. T-shirts were seen in the video for that band's \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\", most notably on drummer Steven Adler. Emory left the band in 1988, during the recording of demos for Strange Love, leaving Roche as the sole remaining original member. though Emory was given a writing credit on the track \\"Blow by Blow\\". T.S.O.L. were joined briefly by guitarist Scotty Phillips, who quit before the band started recording the follow-up to Hit and Run. They eventually hired former Dino's Revenge guitarist and actor Marshall Rohner. They released a blues- metal album, Strange Love, in 1990. Roche quit shortly before the album release, leaving the band with no original members. A compilation album titled Hell and Back Together 1984‚Äì1990 was issued in 1992 with an emphasis on their metal era. Murphy Karges (later of Sugar Ray) replaced Roche on bass; he was then replaced by touring bassist Josh Also. This late-'80s lineup was popular enough to garner bookings in Brazil and Argentina, where the Grisham-led band held no legal rights to prevent Wood from gigging as T.S.O.L. In 1996, Wood and Dean were joined by guitarists Mike Martt and Drac Conley, and bassist Dave Mello (from Uniform Choice), with Dean subsequently replaced by Steve \\"Sully\\" O'Sullivan. Also in 1996, Wood formed ongoing blues band Joe Wood & the Lonely Ones (also including O'Sullivan). Wood recorded as Orange Wedge in 1993 (with Dean Chamberlain of the Motels and Christopher Scott \\"Wag\\" Wagner of Mary's Danish) and Cisco Poison in 1995 (issuing the It's a Long Way to Heaven... album); he later fronted Joe Wood and the Killing Floor (also including O‚ÄôSullivan, longtime T.S.O.L. roadie Eric VonArab and professional skateboarder Ray \\"Bones\\" Rodriguez). Meanwhile, the original members began playing shows under the name T.S.O.L, featuring the band's early material. They often played the same cities, on the same nights, as the other T.S.O.L. Since Wood and Dean now owned the rights to the name T.S.O.L., they threatened to sue the original members, who released the Live '91 (Triple X Records) live album of their early material, under the name \\"Grisham, Roche, Emory and Barnes\\" but stopped playing together soon after its release. They also did some gigs during this time as \\"LOST\\" (T.S.O.L. backwards). Grisham and Emory formed the Joykiller in 1995, releasing three albums prior to disbanding in 1998. In 1999, the original members fought with Wood for rights to the name and won. They joined the Vans Warped Tour, playing for the first time in years under the name T.S.O.L. Barnes died of a brain aneurysm on December 6, 1999, at the age of 34. The remaining members recruited drummer Jay O'Brien (formerly of All Day, later of American Jihad) and released the \\"Anticop\\" single (2001) and the albums Disappear (2001) and Divided We Stand (2003), all on Nitro Records, the latter of which featured Kuehn back on keyboards as well as Billy Blaze replacing O'Brien. Anthony \\"Tiny\\" Biuso (formerly of Rude Awakening, Bad Xample, Full Metal Racket and the Dickies; also later of Hed (pe) and Doyle) joined the band on drums in December 2003 and remained until 2014, serving as the longest standing drummer in the band's three-decade history. He first recorded with the band on 2005's Who's Screwin' Who? (Anarchy Music), a revamping and rerecording of 18 of T.S.O.L.'s greatest hits (it was later reissued under the titles F#*k You Tough Guy: The Collection, by Cleopatra Records, and Code Blue, by Anarchy). In November 2006, the band announced they were breaking up, with final performances having taken place earlier in the month. In September 2007, Cider City Records released the seemingly posthumous live album Live from Long Beach, recorded in November 2006 on the weekend of the band's two announced \\"farewell\\" performances. Their hiatus was short-lived, however, as they returned to perform local shows in late 2007. They also headlined the \\"Fuck the Whales, Save a Chckn\\" benefit in February 2008, held to help with cancer treatment bills for guitarist Craig \\"Chckn\\" Jewett of D.I. In December 2008, the band entered the studio to record Life, Liberty & the Pursuit of Free Downloads, which was made available as a free download through sponsor Hurley International's website on January 8, 2009. It was also released on vinyl by DC-Jam Records on November 1, 2009. Grisham launched another project, Jack Grisham and the Manic Low, in 2011; a debut album, Songs for an Up Day, was released in June 2012. He also formed Jack Grisham's LOST Soul in 2012, a gigging ensemble featuring Kuehn and Biuso, with the intent of performing T.S.O.L. and the Joykiller material. On April 20, 2013, T.S.O.L. released a 7\\" EP, You Don't Have to Die (TKO Records), for Record Store Day, composed of the title track (an unreleased 1980 demo) and two 1981 live tracks. That same year, the band toured Europe and South America; they also completed a US tour with Flag. In 2014, Biuso left the band. He was replaced first by touring member Sean Antillon (a member of numerous bands including Corrupted Ideals, the Gears, Stains, the Skulls, the Weirdos and the Duane Peters Gunfight), then officially by Matt Rainwater (of the Joykiller)., and in 2016 by Chip Hanna. On January 27, 2017, the band released The Trigger Complex album on Rise Records. In August 2017, Antonio Val Hernandez joined the band as drummer, replacing Hanna. T.S.O.L. performing in May 2018, at the Forge in thumb Film and television appearances In 1981, director Paul Young made Urban Struggle: The Battle of The Cuckoo's Nest, a film which featured live performances by T.S.O.L. as well as several Orange County punk and hardcore bands. Dave Markey's 1982 film The Slog Movie also featured live T.S.O.L. performances, as did the 1989 movie The Runnin' Kind. Their music was also featured in the 1984 movie Suburbia, the popular 1985 horror movie The Return of the Living Dead and 1986 film Dangerously Close. They were also mentioned in the 2007 documentary Punk's Not Dead. T.S.O.L. songs \\"Just Like Me\\" and \\"Flowers by the Door\\" were featured in the 1985 CBS Schoolbreak Special: Hear Me Cry, a program about teen suicide.

He was the 20th Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines and head of the Judicial Branch of government from November 1998 to December 2005. As the highest judicial officer, he presided over the Supreme Court of the Philippines. On June 30, 2010, President Noynoy Aquino announced that Davide will head a truth commission that will investigate important issues in the country. Early life and career The sixth of seven siblings, Davide was born in Barangay Colawin, in Argao, Cebu to Hilario P. Davide Sr. (1904‚Äì2006), a retired Schools Division Superintendent, and Josefa L. Gelbolingo, a former public school teacher. He completed his primary education at Argao Central Elementary School and secondary education at Abellana Vocational High School. In college, he went to the country's premier state university, the University of the Philippines Diliman, Quezon City where he earned his Associate in Arts in 1955, his Bachelor of Science in Jurisprudence in 1958, and his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1959. He took and passed the bar examinations given that same year. From 1959 to 1963, Davide worked as private secretary to the vice- governor and later governor of the province of Cebu. From 1962 to 1968, he was a faculty member of the College of Law of Southwestern University in Cebu City. This university, three decades later, would confer on him a degree of Doctor of Laws (Honoris Causa) in 1999. Legislator and constitutionalist Davide's first opportunity to get into the national scene was when he was elected as Delegate of the 4th District of Cebu to the 1971 Constitutional Convention (CONCON). He became Chairman of the Committee on Duties and Obligations of Citizens and Ethics of Public Officials. He was among three delegates who introduced the most number of reform proposals. The reforms adopted under the Constitutional Convention were, however, short-lived. Public unrest over deteriorating economic conditions and the suppression of political rights, as well as the desire of then-President Ferdinand Marcos to perpetuate himself in power, heralded the declaration of martial law in 1972. In 1978, he was elected assemblyman for Cebu in the Interim Batasang Pambansa under the opposition party Pusyon Bisaya and became one of martial law's staunch critics. As an oppositionist in the ruling party-dominated legislative body, he was its first Minority Floor Leader. He filed the most number of bills of national significance, as well as resolutions to lift martial law. He also sought legislative investigations of graft and corruption in government and reported violations of human rights. After the overthrow of the Marcos regime through the People Power revolt in February 1986, then-President Corazon C. Aquino convened the Philippine Constitutional Commission of 1986 and appointed Davide as one of its 50 Commissioners. COMELEC and the 1989 coup In February 1988, President Aquino appointed Davide as Chairman of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC). He was the principal sponsor of the COMELEC's Rules of Procedure. However, his stint in the COMELEC was cut short when President Aquino appointed him as Chairman of the Presidential Fact-Finding Commission to investigate the December 1, 1989 coup attempt in which military rebels meant to oust President Aquino. This presidential commission was tasked to conduct an investigation on the rebellion and the possible involvement of military and civilian officials and private persons. Furthermore, Congress passed Republic Act No. 6832 that enhanced the presidential commission's power through a broader Fact-Finding Commission to conduct a thorough investigation of the failed coup d‚Äô etat and recommend measures to prevent the occurrence of similar attempts at a violent seizure of power. Supreme CourtAssociate Justice= On January 24, 1991, Davide was appointed by then-President Aquino as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. From January 2, 1996 to August 30, 1997, he sat as a member of the Senate Electoral Tribunal. He was also the Working Chairman of the Court's Third Division from January 2, 1996 to September 7, 1997, and Chairman of the House of Representative Electoral Tribunal from September 1, 1997 to November 30, 1998. =Chief Justice= Hilario G. Davide Jr. (Andres Narvasa eulogy with grandson Atty. Carlo Narvasa). On November 30, 1998, he was appointed by President Joseph Estrada as the 20th Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. He took his oath of office at the new Bonifacio Shrine in the City of Manila. He became known as the Centennial and Millennial Chief Justice. He was the presiding judge in the impeachment trial against then-President Estrada in December 2000. When the popular protests spilled into the streets, his timely intervention on behalf of \\"the welfare and will of the people\\" by administering the oath of office as President to then-Vice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. By declaring her the constitutional successor it averted potential violence and military takeover of power, and brought the crisis to an end. Although the moral authority of the Supreme Court carried the day, Davide's action was further bolstered by a precedent setting Supreme Court decision, effectively putting an end to the question of the legitimacy of Vice-President Arroyo's succession to power. Chief Justice Davide, presiding the 2004 oath taking of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as President of the Philippines. =Retirement= Davide retired as chief magistrate on December 20, 2005 after he reached the mandatory retirement age of 70. However, on January 24, 2006, President Arroyo appointed him as Senior Presidential Adviser on Electoral Reforms during a Council of State meeting convened by the President. He recommended measures and policies to the President that would help reform the country's electoral system.

Wright, written by Dennis Hackin and starring professional wrestler Hulk Hogan (who is billed as executive producer alongside Vince McMahon). The film is produced by the World Wrestling Federation under a \\"Shane Distribution Company\\" copyright and was released by New Line Cinema on June 2, 1989. It was launched as an attempt to boost Hulk Hogan's acting career several years after his appearance in Rocky III. Plot Rip Thomas is the World Wrestling Federation Heavyweight Champion, and his appearances on network television have been a thorn in the side of Mr. Brell, the head of the struggling World Television Network. Rip is a huge ratings draw while WTN is the lowest rated television network. The day after Rip's most recent title match, Brell attempts to get Rip to become a part of his network but he refuses. Angry at being stood up by a man he considers a ‚Äújock ass‚Äù, Brell tries to extract revenge to no avail as Rip fights off his goons. Later, Brell visits the No Count Bar, where he comes up with his own wrestling program called Battle of the Tough Guys. The show is successful due to the introduction of Zeus, an ex- convict and former protege of Rip's trainer, Charlie. Zeus wins the $100,000 tournament and becomes Brell's prized fighter. Samantha Moore, a beautiful corporate spy, is sent by Brell to seduce Rip. However, Rip's good nature and dedication to charity win her over, and she confesses her identity to the wrestler and turns to his side. Brell learns of Samantha's defection and, vowing revenge, sends his underlings to kidnap and rape her. However, Rip manages to stop the would-be kidnapping, throwing one of the stooges into a tree trunk. Later, Rip is at a charity event when Brell and Zeus arrive, demanding that Rip prove his honor by fighting Zeus on Battle of the Tough Guys. Rip, wanting to set a good example and knowing children are around, declines. Meanwhile, Rip's younger brother Randy and his friend, Craig, decide to check out Zeus for themselves, attending an illegal fight being held in a warehouse. After watching Zeus defeat the monstrous Rebar Lawless, Craig foolishly identifies Randy as Rip's brother to Brell and his associates. Randy attempts to defend himself but Zeus brutally beats him, sending him to the hospital. Enraged, Rip accepts Zeus' challenge to avenge his brother. On the night of the match, Brell has Samantha kidnapped and orders Rip to go 10 minutes through the fight then lose the fight to save her life. As the battle begins, Samantha manages to escape, but just as Brell's goons corner her, Charlie and Craig rescue her and defeat the bad guys. Back in the arena, Zeus has the upper hand at the start of the fight, ruthlessly pummeling Rip, even trying to kill him by ripping out one of the steel posts and trying to run Rip through his prone chest. Randy cheers to urge his brother to fight back. Rip is re-energized by Randy's words and once he sees Samantha is safe, gains a second wind and starts to turn the tides on Zeus. The fight destroys the ring, with Rip and Zeus continuing the battle up the through the stands as a disbelieving Brell watches from the control room. Rip finally puts an end to the match by knocking Zeus off a catwalk, which causes him to fall through the ring and lose. A frustrated Brell begins destroying electrical equipment, in total disbelief over Zeus' loss. Rip angrily goes after Brell intending to repay him for his misdeeds. In fear, Brell retreats, but accidentally comes in contact with live wires he has exposed in his tirade and is fatally electrocuted. With his enemies now vanquished, Rip celebrates his victory with Randy and his friends. =Cast= * Hulk Hogan as Rip Thomas * Joan Severance as Samantha Moore * Kurt Fuller as Brell * Tiny Lister as Zeus * Mark Pellegrino as Randy Thomas * Bill Henderson as Charlie * Charles Levin as Ordway * David Paymer as Unger * Patrick O'Bryan as Craig * Jeep Swenson as Lugwrench Perkins * Bill Eadie as Jake Bullet * Stan Hansen as Neanderthal * Rebecca Wackler as Ms. Tidings * Bruce Taylor as Mr. Johnson * Gene Okerlund as Himself * Jesse Ventura as Himself * Howard Finkel as Himself * Joey Marella as Himself * Rick Allen as an unnamed wrestler ReceptionBox office= The movie debuted at #2, behind Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, with $4,957,052 in ticket sales. Hogan writes in his autobiography the budget was about eight million dollars. Vince McMahon, who financed the movie, more or less broke even because of distribution fees. The final tally was $16,093,651 in ticket sales. During the October 13, 1997 episode of Monday Night Raw, Vince McMahon joked, \\"Hogan promised me that if the movie lost money he was gonna return his salary. I guess the check is still in the mail.\\" This was during the Monday Night Wars and was part of a number of digs at Hogan's then-new movie project Assault on Devil's Island. Raw commentator Jim Ross also joked during the late 90s; \\"No Holds Barred? More like No Profit Allowed.\\" =Critical response= The film was panned by critics, with a 10% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews. Film critic Brian Orndorf described the film as \\"tremendously crude, unapologetically manipulative, and aimed directly at easily entertained 13-year-old boys.\\" Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a positive review and wrote: \\"The movie never takes itself seriously and director Tom Wright (TV's 'Beauty and the Beast') has fun with the wrestling montages. Hogan himself has an appealing screen presence‚Äîlike a gallant teddy bear who goes berserk every 10 minutes or so.\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer's Desmond Ryan remarked: The Chicago Tribune's Gene Siskel remarked, simply, that No Holds Barred \\"is utterly lacking in the campy quality of the World Wrestling Federation telecasts.\\" In his 1991 review of Suburban Commando, Roger Ebert recalled that \\"despite the fact that [Hulk Hogan's] public image is often aimed at children [...] his first film, 'No Holds Barred' (1989) was surprisingly violent, sexist and blood-soaked.\\" Richard Harrington of The Washington Post said that \\"[Hogan's] performance is as dreadful as one might expect from a man with such limited skills outside the ring, made worse by a story that is at once more obvious and less inspired than your average Wrestlemania script. [...] 'No Holds Barred' makes 'Rocky' look like 'Citizen Pain.'\\" Wrote Stephen Holden of The New York Times: Reviewing the Blu-ray in 2014, Felix Vasquez Jr. of Cinema Crazed wrote: \\"Hogan as The Ripper is a force of nature here, and he makes \\"No Holds Barred\\" in to a fun action cartoon.\\" Home video The film was released on VHS, Betamax, and LaserDisc in October 1989. It was released on DVD for the first time ever with a digitally remastered transfer by WWE Home Video under the WWE Studios banner on July 3, 2012. A Blu-ray Disc release followed in April 2014. No Holds Barred: The Match/The Movie No Holds Barred: The Match/The Movie, as the event was billed, was shown on pay-per-view on December 27, 1989. The program consisted of the film in its entirety, followed by a match previously recorded at a Wrestling Challenge taping on December 12 in Nashville, Tennessee. It is currently one of the few WWE pay-per-views not yet available on the WWE Network. = Background = The main event pitted Hogan and Lister ‚Äî appearing in character as \\"Zeus\\" ‚Äî on opposing tag teams. Hogan teamed with longtime friend Brutus Beefcake, while the heel Zeus teamed with Randy Savage. The four had been involved in an intertwined feud since the summer. Zeus had made several appearances at WWF events and cut promos stating that he, and not Hogan, should have received top billing in No Holds Barred. Meanwhile, as Hogan and Savage were feuding over the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, Beefcake began feuding with Savage after Beefcake insulted Savage's manager Sensational Sherri during a TV taping. At the 1989 SummerSlam, Hogan and Beefcake teamed to defeat Savage and Zeus, after which the tag team feud simmered for several months as Zeus began appearing with Ted DiBiase in the lead-up to the 1989 Survivor Series. Unlike 1989 SummerSlam, Miss Elizabeth did not make an appearance at this event. The Hogan-Beefcake vs. Savage-Zeus tag team rivalry resumed after the Survivor Series, in the lead-up to \\"No Holds Barred: The Match/The Movie.\\" =ResultsMatch result= The Hogan-Beefcake vs. Savage-Zeus steel-cage match was part of a WWF Wrestling Challenge taping. In addition to matches pitting mid- and lower-card wrestlers against jobbers, other contests (which were not televised) saw \\"The American Dream\\" Dusty Rhodes defeat Big Boss Man, WWF Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior defeat Dino Bravo, The Colossal Connection (Andr√© the Giant and Haku) defeat WWF Tag Team Champions Demolition by countout, and Curt Hennig defeat Ron Garvin. Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake defeated Randy Savage and Zeus in the 09:27-long steel-cage match. The match could be won either by pinfall/submission or by having both members of a team escape the cage. After a back-and-forth match early on, all four competitors were knocked out after Hogan hit a suplex on Zeus, and Beefcake and Savage hit each other's heads into the cage structure. Sensational Sherri (the manager of the Savage-Zeus team) handed a chain to Savage, who attempted to strike Beefcake with a fist drop off the top of the cage, but Beefcake recovered and caught Savage coming off. Eventually, Beefcake knocked Savage to the mat and escaped the cage; Savage‚Äîwith some eventual help from Beefcake‚Äîcrawled outside, tying the match at 1-apiece. Meanwhile, Hogan rallied against Zeus, battering him before dropping three leg drops to score the pin and the win for the Hogan-Beefcake team. =Aftermath= This was Zeus' last match in the WWF, as Lister left shortly afterward; meanwhile, Savage continued to target Hogan, and later, The Ultimate Warrior, over the WWF Championship. Zeus (as Z-Gangsta) and Hogan would eventually face each other again in the main event at WCW's Uncensored (1996) with Savage this time partnering Hogan, in a two-versus-eight Doomsday Cage match.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/uncensored.htm Among the dark matches, the Demolition-Colossal Connection match was contested one day prior to the match where the Colossal Connection won the WWF Tag Team Championship, while Dino Bravo continued to be the Ultimate Warrior's top foe for the Intercontinental Championship.

The ollie is a skateboarding trick where the rider and board leap into the air without the use of the rider's hands.http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ollie It is the combination of stomping, also known as popping, the tail of the skateboard off of the ground to get the board mostly vertical, jumping, and sliding the front foot forward to level out the skateboard at the peak of the jump. Gravity does the rest of the work. The ollie is a fundamental skill in skateboarding. Ollies are necessary to leap onto, over, or off of obstacles. As most flip tricks depend on it, the ollie is often the first skill to be learned by a new skateboarder, therefore it typically takes considerable practice to learn. Julio Pineda with the bowl ollie at Owl's Head Skate Park - October 2019 Origin of the technique In 1978, Alan Gelfand, who was given his nickname \\"Ollie\\" by Scott Goodman, learned to perform no-handed aerials in bowls and pools using a gentle raising of the nose and scooping motion to keep the board with the feet.Glossary of skateboard terms, about.com rodney muulen invented the street ollie There are numerous references to Alan Gelfand's Ollie with most notably pictures in the 1970s skateboarding magazine \\"Skateboarder\\". In 1982, while competing in the Rusty Harris contest in Whittier, California, Rodney Mullen debuted an ollie on flat ground, which he had adapted from Gelfand's vertical version by combining the motions of some of his existing tricks. Mullen used a \\"see-saw\\" motion, striking the tail of the board on the ground to lift the nose, and using the front foot to level the board in mid-air.Excerpt from Mutt: How to Skateboard and not Kill Yourself by Rodney Mullen, Sean Mortimer While Mullen was not initially impressed with his flat ground ollie, and did not formally name it, he realized it opened up a second, elevated plane on which to perform tricks. Mullen's flat ground ollie is now considered to have transformed the practice of skateboarding. Rodney won the Rusty Harris contest, was afterwards asked by many riders to demonstrate the trick, and later in the year it would appear with the name \\"Ollie-pop\\" as a \\"trick tip\\" in the skateboarding magazine Thrasher. The flat ground ollie technique is strongly associated with street skateboarding; mini ramp and vert riders can also use this technique to gain air and horizontal distance from the coping, but half-pipe riders typically rely more on the board's upward momentum to keep it with the rider, more similar to Gelfand's original technique. Execution of the flatground ollie Video of several attempts to ollie over a rail Nick Capamaggio performing an Ollie over a chair. The rider begins the ollie by crouching and jumping directly upward. As the rider begins to leap, instead of lifting the feet from the board, they \\"pop\\" the tail by striking it against the ground, which raises the board nose-first. Maintaining contact with the board, the rider lifts the front leg and bends the front ankle so that the outer or top side of the shoe slides towards the nose of the board. The friction between the shoe and the board's grip tape (which not all skateboarders will choose to have, although most do) helps to guide and pull the board upward, while the rear foot only maintains slight contact with board to help guide it. When nearing the peak of the jump, the rider lifts the rear leg and pushes the front foot forward, which levels the board and keeps it in contact with the back foot. The skater can gain greater clearance from the ground by jumping higher, popping faster, sliding the front foot farther forwards (starting the jump with the front foot farther back), and pulling the legs higher into the chest to raise the feet higher. Skaters attempting record-setting ollies even contort the legs so that board and feet are not directly below them, allowing the board to rise at or just below the level of the pelvis. Very low ollies can be achieved using the same technique, but without the tail making contact with the ground. Even basic flip tricks can be achieved without the \\"pop\\" of the tail. An example of a very low ollie. Records A skateboarder performing an ollie over a gap. The highest official flat ground ollies are generally performed in ollie contests. * The highest preferred stance ollie was from the ground, performed by Aldrin Garcia. * The highest switch stance ollie was , performed by Gavin Caperton.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dteRp0PzbNs *The world record for the greatest number of consecutive ollies is held by Rob Dyrdek, who performed 215 ollies on the television show Rob and Big.http://www.proskateboards.co.uk/5/articles/18/ollie-skateboarding-trick/ The world record for the highest number of consecutive ollies is held by Rob Dyrdek, who performed 215 ollies on the television show Rob and Big. Nollie The most common variation of the ollie is the nollie (short for \\"nose ollie\\"), where the rider reverses the roles of the two legs so that the front foot pops the nose to the ground, and the rear foot lifts and guides the tail. The switch stance ollie uses a similar body motion, but the nollie is subtly distinct: For one, the rider is always moving forward, with the body positioned in a nollie stance--closer to the nose and with the front foot on the nose. Secondly the rider usually postures the body differently so as to compensate for this stance with respect to the forward motion. The rider presses the nose down using their front foot to engage the \\"pop\\" motion in order for the board to rise. This is In contrast to a \\"Fakie Ollie\\" where the pop motion is performed by the rear foot on the tail, similarly to a normal Ollie, however the rider is traveling backwards when performing a Fakie Ollie. Where in a Nollie the rider is traveling forward with their front foot on the nose to apply the initial force \\"pop\\". Other variations * Switch Ollie: an Ollie performed in the stance opposite of a rider's normal stance. (Switch Stance). * Nollie: an Ollie performed using the front foot to snap the nose down. * Fakie Ollie: an ollie done while riding backwards * The Chinese Ollie: executed without hitting the tail of the skateboard to the ground, instead the skateboarder uses cracks in the sidewalk, by \\"bouncing\\" off them, to get air- time. * Ollie 180: an Ollie where the skateboarder and the skateboard spins 180 degrees after leaving the ground. Both the skateboarder and the skateboard rotate in the same direction (Frontside or Backside) with the skateboarder's feet sticking to the skateboard. This trick is usually referred to as a frontside or backside 180, or less frequently and more popular with older skateboarders and/or when performed on a bank/quarterpipe, a frontside / backside ollie * Nollie 180: just like the Ollie 180 but done from a Nollie. * Half-Cab: just like the Ollie 180 but done in fakie. If rotated 360 degrees the trick is called a Full-Cab or Caballerial, named after Steve Caballero who invented them as aerials in pools. Cab and half-cab spins only include fakie backside. A fakie frontside 180 is not a half-cab. * Switch Ollie 180: just like the Ollie 180 but done from a Switch Ollie. * Ollie 360: is a full 360 rotation of the body and board together in one motion, whether front-side or back-side can be attained from this variation. * One Foot: an Ollie where the front foot is kicked forward over the nose of the board. * Ollie North: the original name for the one foot * Boned Ollie: an ollie where the board is dipped down and the legs are practically horizontal, like a \\"Melon Grab\\" but without the skateboarder actually grabbing the skateboard. * Ghost Ollie: an ollie where the skateboarder's feet are above the board but the board and the skateboarder are still in air. * Pop-Shuvit: is an Ollie variation with the snap of the tail rotating the board 180 or 360 beneath the rider and catching it in mid-air. A Pressure-flip has a similar aspect from this trick, but only by applying pressure back-toe inward while jumping, will the rider make a rotation and inward flip successful. * Primo Ollie: is an Ollie performed when standing in a primo position or when doing a primo slide. A primo Ollie is executed in the same way as an Ollie but the side of the front foot levels out the board instead of the top of the foot. *Hop Ollie: an Ollie using only one foot, such as a \\"Hop Nollie\\" http://vimeo.com/101162471 (not the same as a no- comply) ReferencesExternal links *How to Ollie Video *How to Ollie tutorial with pictures *Ollie Trick Tip with video *How To Ollie Category:Skateboarding tricks Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Ollie (skateboarding)"},{"id":"1623524","text":"The Kinetic Energy Interceptor (KEI) was a planned U.S. missile defense program whose goal was to design, develop, and deploy kinetic energy-based, mobile, ground and sea-launched missiles that could intercept and destroy enemy ballistic missiles during their boost, ascent and midcourse phases of flight.

Located twelve miles northeast of Brenham, it was founded in 1835 in Austin's colony of Anglo-Americans. It became a Baptist religious and educational center of the Republic of Texas. In 1845 it became the first site of Baylor University and the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor. The wealthiest community in Texas in 1845, Independence declined later in the century after refusing to give a right-of-way to the Santa Fe Railroad. It was bypassed by the increasingly important railroads and started a long decline after the university moved away. It retains significant historic structures and sites of the nineteenth century. Its residents included many prominent people of early Texas history, including Sam Houston while he was a U.S. Senator. The Houston family were well-known members of the Independence Baptist Church. History Independence was once a significant center for religion and education in the Republic of Texas. The year of the town's founding (1835), Frances J. S. Trask of Gloucester, Massachusetts, started a boarding school for girls. In 1839 the Independence Baptist Church was organized, the fourth Missionary Baptist Church in Texas. It continues as an active congregation, the second-oldest one affiliated with the Baptist General Convention of Texas. Site of Home of General Sam Houston and Family In 1845, Independence won the bid for a Texas university. The regional Union Baptist Association, which had originated the university proposal, built the institution, chartered by the Republic of Texas Congress. It was named after one of its founders, R.E.B. Baylor, a former U.S. Congressman. Baylor University opened its doors in 1846, the first year of Texas statehood, with a total of 24 students, both male and female. (Later the women were separated into an independent institution, known as Baylor Women's College.) In 1852 the town was incorporated, with T.T. Clay as its first mayor. Soon it had a hotel, a Masonic Lodge, stagecoach depot, and a small commercial center. The residents built fine homes, several of which have been preserved. In 1854, Sam Houston was baptized by the Independence Baptist Church. His wife Margaret Lea Houston and her mother Nancy Moffette Lea died in the town during the 1860s and were buried at the family's cemetery there. (Sam Houston's grave is in Huntsville, Texas.)Byron Augustin and William R. Pitts,, \\"Independence, Texas\\", Handbook of Texas Online, accessed 27 Aug 2010 When the Santa Fe Railroad wanted to establish a line through town, the city leaders refused to grant it a right-of-way. By the 1880s, most railroads bypassed the town, taking trade with them. As students found it difficult to get transportation to Independence, Baylor University officials decided in 1885 to move the institution to a more accessible location, Waco. The women's college was moved to Belton, where it became known as the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor. These changes added to the long decline of Independence. By 1966 it had 200 residents, and by 1990 it had 140, qualifying as a rural settlement. The population was unchanged in 2000. Original Site of Baylor University The community has retained several significant historic structures and sites from its nineteenth-century peak. Its attractions include the Texas Baptist Historical Center; the home of Judge J.P. Coles, one of the Old Three Hundred of the Austin Colony; Baylor College Park; Old Independence Cemetery, a state historic site; and Houston-Lea Family Cemetery. The Margaret Houston House is on the National Register of Historic Places, as are the Seward Plantation and the Asa Hoxey House.

In early 1945 he was drafted into the Flakhelfer, the youth auxiliary of the Luftwaffe, serving in a special unit that performed courier functions. Kempowski's father, who had volunteered for military service at the beginning of the war, only to be turned away because of his membership in the Freemasons, was accepted for service in summer 1940, and died in combat on 26 April 1945. =Postwar= In the immediate postwar period, Kempowski worked for the U.S. Army in Wiesbaden, in the American zone of Allied-occupied Germany. In March 1948, during a visit to his home city of Rostock, in the Soviet zone, in what would later become communist East Germany, he was arrested by Soviet authorities and accused of spying for the U.S. Convicted by a Soviet military tribunal and sentenced to 25 years, he served eight years in a prison in Bautzen, and was released in 1956. In West Germany he became a teacher in Breddorf (as of 1960), in (as of 1965) and in Zeven (between 1975 and 1979). Kempowski died of intestinal cancer, aged 78, in Rotenburg in 2007. Works Kempowski's first success as an author was the autobiographic novel Tadell√∂ser und Wolf, in which he described his youth in Nazi Germany from the viewpoint of a well-off middle- class family. In several more books he completed the story of his family from the early 20th century into the late 1950s. Between 1993 and 2005, he published his enormous chronicle Das Echolot, a collection and collage of documents by people of many kinds living in the circumstances of war. The ten- volume work consists of thousands of personal documents, letters, newspaper reports, and autobiographical accounts that he began collecting in the 1980s. The documents are now deposited in the archive of the Academy of Arts, Berlin. The last volume of Das Echolot was translated into English by Shaun Whiteside under the title Swansong 1945: A Collective Diary from Hitler's Birthday to VE Day (Granta, 2014).

She is also president of Executives of Construction Party women's league and the former editor-in-chief of Zan newspaper. She is the daughter of the former president, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and the sister of Fatemeh Rafsanjani and Mehdi Rafsanjani. Early life and education Rafsanjani is the daughter of Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Effat Marashi. She holds a master of laws degree in international human rights from Birmingham City University. Career Rafsanjani was a member of the Executives of Construction Party that was established by moderate politicians. Between 1996 and 2000 she was a parliament representative from Tehran. She founded the women's newspaper Zan in 1998, which was disestablished in April 1999. =Views and activism= In the 1997 presidential elections, Rafsanjani supported Mohammad Khatami. During the 2009 Iranian election protests, Reuters reported that Rafsanjani addressed a crowd at a banned opposition rally in Tehran on 16 June, and was subsequently prohibited from leaving the country. She was arrested and briefly detained at least twice after participating in an opposition rallies in Tehran on 20 June 2009 (together with four relatives), and again on 20 February 2010 after \\"making blunt statements and chanting provocative slogans,\\" according to Iranian state media. She was again arrested in February 2011. In March 2011, her son, Hassan, was also arrested. A couple of videos appeared on the internet showing her being harassed by hardliners.

After the court told her about her accusation of propaganda against the regime, she and her lawyer gave their defence. Hashemi was arrested and released after taking part in a number of protests which erupted after a 2009 election which saw President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad reelected to office despite opposition claims the vote was rigged. She was arrested again for participating in anti-regime demonstrations in February 2011. Her father, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was facing harsh criticism from conservatives who demand he publicly condemn opposition leaders Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi - he lost his seat on the powerful Assembly of Experts as a result. Rafsanjani later somewhat distanced himself from the opposition leaders and condemned the last anti-government demonstrations staged by their supporters. But his stance did not satisfy the conservatives. Sentencing On 3 January 2012, she was sentenced to six months in prison. She had 20 days to appeal. On 22 September 2012, Hashemi was arrested to serve her sentence. She was taken to Evin prison.

In the Bible identifies Saul's elder daughter as Merab and younger daughter as Michal. Michal's story is recorded in the first Book of Samuel, where it is said in and that Michal loved David. The narrative does not indicate whether this is reciprocated.In , David is \\"pleased ... to become the king‚Äôs son-in- law\\" but we are not told whether he was pleased to have married Michal. See Cohen, M., \\"The Transparency of Saul\\", European Judaism, volume 39, no. 1, 2006, for a comparison of the transparent presentation of Saul and the opaqueness of David's character in 1 Samuel. After his success in battle against the Philistine giant Goliath, Merab was given in marriage to Adriel. Later, after Merab had married Adriel the Meholathite, Saul invited David to marry Michal. David replied, \\"I am a poor and lightly esteemed man\\", meaning that he was unable to provide a bride price. Saul then advised him that no bride price was required except for the foreskins of 100 Philistines. David took part in a further battle, killed 200 Philistines, and brought their foreskins to Saul as a double bride price. In the biblical narrative, Michal chooses the welfare of David over the wishes of her father. When Saul's messengers search for David in order to kill him, Michal sends them away while pretending he was ill and laid up in bed. She lets David down through a window and hides teraphim in his bed as a ruse.Exum, J. Cheryl. \\"Michal: Bible.\\" Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia. 20 March 2009. Jewish Women's Archive J. Cheryl Exum points out that although she risked her life in helping him, after he leaves the court, he makes no attempt to contact her. While David was hiding for his life, Saul gave Michal as a wife to Palti, son of Laish, and David took several other wives, including Abigail. Later, when David became king of Judah and Ish-bosheth (Michal's brother, and Saul's son) was king of Israel, David demanded her return to him in return for peace between them. Ish-bosheth complied, despite the public protests of Palti. Robert Alter observes that by stressing that he had paid the requested bride price, David makes a legal argument as a political calculation to reinforce his legitimacy as a member of the royal house. Alter notes the contrast between David's measured negotiations and Palti's public grief. After Michal was returned to David, she criticised him for dancing in an undignified manner, as he brought the Ark of the Covenant to the newly captured Jerusalem in a religious procession. For this she is punished, according to Samuel, with not having children till the day she dies. Unlike Abigail and Bathsheba, Michal is not described as being beautiful, though Rabbinic tradition holds that she was of \\"entrancing beauty.\\" Michal is also briefly mentioned in 1 Chronicles 15:29. Legality of second marriage These events have raised moral issues within Judaism, especially in the context of the prohibition in . On the one hand, some argue that it is prohibited to re-establish a marriage with a previous spouse who has subsequently remarried. On the other hand, other commentators explain that David had not divorced Michal at this point in time, but rather Saul acted to break their marriage by marrying her off to another without David's consent.Though the Book of Deuteronomy attributes itself to the period of the Hebrews' Exodus from Egypt, many historians regard it as having been actually written during the late monarchy. David's appearing to be oblivious to the prohibition laid down in it seems additional evidence in support of such theories. On that view, they were not technically divorced as David had not issued a writ of divorcement according to biblical law. =Offspring= Some have argued that it is unclear whether Michal died barren and childless, as stated in , or had children, as described in most manuscriptsThe New International Version of the Bible uses Merab from two Hebrew and some Septuagint manuscripts but cites that most manuscripts say Michal of , which mention \\"the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul.\\" The justification for the NIV's textual rendering (see also ESV, NASB, and NRSV) is surely found in the completion of the clause, which states \\"...whom she had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite.\\" That it was Merab who married Adriel is attested without ambiguity (); it is extraordinarily difficult to argue that Michal might have borne five sons to her sister's husband. Gill attempted to resolve the conundrum presented by many Hebrew manuscripts' use of Michal, rather than Merab, by translating 2 Samuel 21:8 as \\"the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite\\". Now, Merab, Michal's older sister, was the wife of Adriel (). According to Gill, these five sons were not born to Michal but were brought up or educated by her after Merab perhaps had died; i.e., Merab brought them forth, and Michal brought them up.See John Gill commentary on 2 Samuel 21 However, the Hebrew word, ◊ô◊ú◊ì◊î, which Gill understands to mean \\"brought up,\\" everywhere else means \\"gave birth to.\\" Context struggles to justify Gill's translation. However, for a literalist interpretation, Gill‚Äôs translation must stand. Michal in poetry * In 1707, Georg Christian Lehms published in Hanover the novel Die ungl√ºckselige Princessin Michal und der verfolgte David ('The hapless Princess Michal and David pursued'), based on the Biblical story. *In her poem \\"Michal\\", in her book Flowers of Perhaps, the Israeli poet Ra'hel Bluwstein draws a parallel between the speaker and Michal: \\"Like you I am sad, O Michal ... and like you doomed to love a man whom I despise.\\" Use as a name \\"Michal\\" is a very common female first name in contemporary Israel. Although possessing an identical or almost identical spelling when using the Latin alphabet, the Czech and Slovak language \\"Michal\\" and the Polish language \\"Micha≈Ç\\" (popular male given names) are the local forms of \\"Michael\\" rather than of \\"Michal\\". This can be compared to French spelling \\"Michel\\", which is also a local form of \\"Michael\\".

Category:September in the Eastern Orthodox calendar ","title":"September 10 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)"},{"id":"1623646","text":"Songs for Dustmites is the debut album by American musician and former Blue's Clues host Steve Burns. It was released on August 12, 2003, by PIAS America. The album was produced by Dave Fridmann, member of alternative rock band Mercury Rev and the producer of most of the albums by The Flaming Lips; and Ed Buller. After quitting Blue's Clues, Burns, \\"in a position where [he] could do what [he] wanted\\", decided to collaborate with Fridmann and other members of The Flaming Lips. After receiving multiple offers from various record labels, Burns chose PIAS America. Songs for Dustmites is a pop/rock or indie rock album, and its lyrics are mostly about \\"science and love\\". It received positive reviews from music critics, although some of them believed that the album was only good because of his collaborations. The song \\"Mighty Little Man\\" is used as the theme song to the CBS television show Young Sheldon. Background and recording Before acting in Blue's Clues, Burns had been in many high-school and college bands. When he left the show in 2002 after working there for half a dozen years, he \\"found [himself] in a position where [he] could do what [he] wanted\\", he decided to become a musician. He worked on demos, rehearsing the songs over and over again, scared to show them to anyone. Burns began recording the album once he got a computer that could record and edit sounds. He recorded it in a trial-and-error way, until he believed it sounded right. Burns started making Songs for Dustmites after he \\"was obsessed with a picture someone had shown [him] of a dustmite fighting with a micro gear\\". Burns later sent producer Dave Fridmann an e-mail introducing himself and sent the demos the day after Fridmann's son had a Blue's Clues-themed birthday party. Fridmann liked the demos, so he sent Burns to Tarbox Road Studios in Fredonia, New York, where they worked with The Flaming Lips member Steven Drozd. Mac Randall of The New York Observer hypothesized that the band decided to work with Burns because it was \\"too off- the-wall to resist.\\" Burns stated of recording with members of the Flaming Lips that \\"There were definitely moments when I would run into the next room so I could giggle maniacally, jump up and down and clap my hands\\", calling the experience \\"a dream come true\\". According to Burns, \\"he and Fridmann gave [him] a lot of help in understanding the studio process, how it all works, how to take a musical idea and shine it up into a song\\". Ed Buller wrote to Burns, \\"sort of in disbelief\\". Burns suspects that Buller searched the Internet for Burns and downloaded his songs, \\"expecting to make fun of [him]\\", and was surprised that the music was not bad. Burns also met and worked with Mike Rubin from Murmur Music, saying that \\"some of the best work on the album came out of that relationship\\". Burns received numerous offers from various record labels mostly due to him making an album being a \\"ridiculous story\\". He chose to sign with PIAS Records after talking with Kevin Wortis of the label, saying he \\"was the first one who sat me down and said, 'This makes sense. I don't know why, but there is a thread of logic between Blue's Clues, the Flaming Lips and your record'.\\" Composition Lyrically, Songs for Dustmites deals with \\"familiar themes of love and loss\\", while Burns himself has described the album as \\"songs about science and love\\". Musically, the album fits into the pop/rock and alternative rock genres, and is heavily influenced by the Flaming Lips. The lyrics of the opening track \\"Mighty Little Man\\" have been interpreted in different ways: a television watcher who suddenly turns into \\"an everyday superhero\\", or \\"a lonely inventor's eureka moment\\". It was inspired by inventor Thomas Edison and his \\"DIY projects that changed human history\\". When Burns made the song, he wanted to \\"write a positive, empowering, exclamation point of a song\\". The song itself contains a \\"fury of noise\\". The following track, \\"What I Do on Saturday\\", is a \\"playful\\" pop song, while \\"Maintain\\" is a more mainstream song influenced by American alternative band They Might Be Giants. The song \\"Troposphere\\" is \\"bright and bouncy\\", sounding like the Flaming Lips song \\"Fight Test\\". The ballad \\"A Song for Dustmites\\" contains piano and synths. The next track, \\"Stick Around\\", is melancholic and sounds optimistic with its cello and trumpet. \\">1\\" is a \\"simple\\" downtempo song that tells the story of a dysfunctional relationship. It features strings and a guitar solo. Reception Songs for Dustmites received positive reviews from music critics; most of them were surprised that an album made by the former Blue's Clues host would be any good. Heather Phares of AllMusic called the album \\"a promising debut\\", writing it was \\"a good-natured collection of atmospheric pop that takes a few chances now and then.\\" She gave the album three and a half stars out of five. Pitchfork gave it a 7.8/10 and complimented Burns' \\"lyrical insight and gift for writing and arranging endlessly listenable pop songs\\". The album as a whole was described as managing \\"to remain true to Burns' legacy as a nice-guy kid's show host despite having made an unabashedly adult record that deals with familiar themes of love and loss\\". Brian Houston of PopMatters wrote that \\"Songs for Dustmites is a successful album, but the caveat will always be that the reason for the success lies with the Lips contributions and not with Burns' talent or vision\\".

Founded in 1985, it is often regarded as the Philippines' newspaper of record. History The Philippine Daily Inquirer was a daily newspaper founded on 9 December 1985 by publisher Eugenia Ap√≥stol, columnist Max Soliv√©n, together with Betty Go-Belmonte during the last days of the regime of the Philippine dictator, Ferdinand Marcos, becoming one of the first private newspapers to be established under the Marcos regime. The Inquirer succeeded the weekly Philippine Inquirer, created in 1985 by Apostol to cover the trial of 25 soldiers accused of complicity in the assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr. at the Manila International Airport on August 21, 1983. Apostol also published the Mr & Ms Special Edition, a weekly tabloid opposed to the Marcos regime. =Beltran years (1985‚Äì89)= As the successor to the previous Mr. and Mrs. Special Edition and the weekly Philippine Inquirer, it was founded on a budget of P1 million and enjoyed a daily circulation of 30,000 in its early days. The new daily was housed in the dilapidated one-story Star Building on 13th and Railroad streets in Port Area, Manila. It was put out by 40 editors, reporters, correspondents, photographers and other editorial employees working in a 100 square meter newsroom. Columnist Louie Beltran was named its editor- in-chief. The newspaper was instrumental then in documenting the campaign of Corazon Aquino during the 1986 presidential elections and, in turn, the 1986 People Power Revolution. Its slogan, Balanced News, Fearless Views, was incorporated to the newspaper in January 1986 after a slogan-making contest held during the first month of the Inquirer's existence. In this period, the newspaper reached a high circulation of 500,000 copies a day. In July 1986, questions about finances and a divergence of priorities caused a rift among the founders which led Belmonte, Soliven, and Art Borjal's split from the Inquirer to establish The Philippine Star. As Belmonte owned the Star Building where the Inquirer was headquartered, the newspaper amicably transferred to the Soliven-owned BF Condominium in Aduana Street, Intramuros. =Pascual years (1989‚Äì91)= In February 1987, Federico D. Pascual, former assistant managing editor of the Daily Express, was named executive editor of Inquirer and was appointed editor-in-chief two years later. It was during his term in 1990 that the Inquirer took the lead from the Manila Bulletin to become the Philippines' largest newspaper in terms of circulation. However, in July 1990, the Inquirer headquarters in Intramuros was damaged by the 1990 Luzon earthquake. On January 5, 1991, the newspaper transferred to the YIC building along United Nations Avenue and Romualdez Street in Malate. =Jimenez- Magsanoc years (1991‚Äì2015)= PDI logo prior to the 2016 relaunch Letty Jimenez Magsanoc, Inquirer's editor-in-chief from 1991 until her death in 2015. Inquirer's longest-serving and first woman editor-in-chief, the late Letty Jimenez-Magsanoc, was appointed on June 14, 1991. She was a former columnist and editor of the \\"Panorama\\" Sunday magazine of Bulletin Today (now Manila Bulletin) who was sacked for writing articles poking fun at Marcos. She edited Mr & Ms Special Edition until the fall of the Marcos regime. She is also the first editor in chief of Sunday Inquirer Magazine. Under her term, in 1995, the Inquirer moved to its current headquarters in Makati after transferring headquarters four times. During the administration of president Joseph Estrada, he criticized the Inquirer for \\"bias, malice, and fabrication\\" against him‚Äîthis charge to the newspaper was denied. In 1999, several government organizations, pro-Estrada businesses, and movie producers simultaneously pulled their advertisements from the Inquirer in a boycott that lasted for five months. Malaca√±ang Palace was widely implicated in the advertising boycott, which was denounced by then publisher Isagani Yambot as an attack on the freedom of the press. In 2007, according to the survey conducted by AGB Nielsen, the Inquirer was the most widely-read newspaper in the Philippines. The Manila Bulletin and The Philippine Star followed as the second and the third most widely read papers, respectively. Magsanoc died on December 24, 2015 at St. Luke's Medical Center in Taguig. A month after her death, Jimenez-Magsanoc was recognized as the Filipino of the Year 2015 by the Inquirer. =Nolasco years (2016‚Äìpresent)= On February 2, 2016, the Inquirer appointed its managing editor Jose Ma. Nolasco as the executive editor, the new top position of the newspaper, replacing the traditional editor-in-chief position that used by Inquirer for more than three decades. Nolasco was the managing editor of the Inquirer for 24 years, and he is part of the first batch of reporters of the Inquirer when the paper started its publication in 1985. On October 6, 2016, the Inquirer launched a \\"rethink\\" of its print and digital presence by overhauling its newspaper design and website, Inquirer.net and the launch of \\"My Inquirer\\" which converged the platforms of Inquirer in print, desktop, smartphone, tablet, and smartwatch. The redesign was done in collaboration with Dr. Mario Garcia of Garcia Media.

In general, it is a layer which is underneath another layer, so underlay is thus also used to describe many different surface-covering products. In vinyl flooring or \\"linoleum\\", the underlay is the thin layer of plywood that is fastened over the structural subfloor to create a uniform, smooth platform for the sheet vinyl. For laminated wood flooring, the underlay provides a ‚Äúvapor barrier‚Äù to prevent moisture from coming through the floor of the home and then migrating into the flooring; the underlayment may also have noise-dampening properties. A self-leveling underlay is a cement-like product that can be pumped in liquid form onto the floor in order to create a level floor. Underlay is also the term for the material under roofing tiles; this roofing membrane is often made of rubber and is used to seal the roof and prevent leakage. Underlayment used with roofing shingles provides a second layer of water proofing to prevent leaks and is called tar paper, roofing felt, or since the 1990s synthetic underlayment. Bedding underlay (or mattress overlay) is a thick, extra layer of padding between the bed mattress and bedding. Underlays are designed to increase comfort and support, while extending the life of the mattress (or mattress protector). Common underlay materials include: Wool, foam, and latex. In music, underlay refers to text intended for vocalization ‚Äì positioned either directly or indirectly under notes on a musical staff. Carpet Popular carpet underlays are * foam rubber * crumb rubber * felt * cork More recent innovations in underlay materials include recycled plastic underlay, which can be made from plastic bottles and other single-use plastics for reduced environmental impact. Carpet underlays are typically 6-10mm. They primarily provide foot comfort, but they also reduce carpet wear and provide sound and thermal insulation. Wood floor Underlay for timber floors is typically 3mm closed cell plastic foam. This primarily provides sound insulation and a vapour barrier. A watertight vapour barrier should only be used though, when neither condensation from humid air coming from beneath nor water spillage coming from above are to be expected. Especially if there is spillage it will otherwise take a much longer time for the moisture to disperse and evaporate if it is prevented by the barrier from seeping through the wooden flooring. This might make it necessary to raise the temperature of the floor to facilitate evaporation and prevent rot.

Whether the board is appointed or elected, and whether it is merely advisory or has authority over the budget, depends on state and local laws. Its role is to act as a balance against the Board of Selectmen or School Board, which usually set the budget and present it to the public at town meeting. Typically the Board of Finance is seen as being more cost-conscious than the governing body - that is, it prefers smaller budgets. In many towns, the budget is split between general government, administered by the Board of Selectmen and the school district administered by the Board of Education. The school district include one town or several towns, which join into a \\"regional\\" (Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire) or \\"unified\\" (Vermont) school district. School districts in New England do not have separate taxation powers, and must receive their revenues from member towns. Typically, after the Board of Selectmen or School Board settle their respective budgets, they are submitted to the Board of Finance for review. The Board of Finance may return the budget to the respective bodies with requests for changes, or may refer it to the town meeting for approval. In some cases, the Board of Finance may establish the budget itself, leaving the Selectmen or School Board to comment. Outside the budget process, the Board of Finance may perform financial oversight duties on behalf of the town.

He was born on November 12, 1971 in State College, Pennsylvania, where he lived until he was about age six. After that, he lived in New Jersey for two years and then in New Hampshire for around twelve years. Background Shear's musical skills are self-taught. After teaching himself to play the piano, he took piano lessons for a couple of months, but he stopped when he found that they involved more \\"unlearning\\" of techniques he had taught himself than learning new techniques he could use. He graduated from Syracuse University in 1994 with a degree in TV and film production. While still in high school in the late 1980s, he began creating instrumental synthpop music at home under the name Man on a Stage, as well as playing bass live for a punk-influenced band named The Advocates. Shear credits the band Depeche Mode as having influenced him more than any other group towards the electronic music styles. Another significant influence came when he attended a Depeche Mode concert in 1988; Shear was astounded by the industrial dance music played by the opening DJ, and began incorporating industrial influences into his music. Man on a Stage was at this point retitled Assemblage 23. Personal life Tom lives with his partner Mari Kattman who also sings in their project Helix. Assemblage 23 Shear worked on Assemblage 23 throughout his college years, occasionally sending out demos to little effect. During the same time he collaborated with friends Matt Guenette and Mike Ukstins on a synthpop project named Procession, gaining experience with live performance. In 1992, Shear self-released a collection called \\"Wires\\", which generated some buzz among minor radio stations and underground magazines, but still little interest from record labels. In the mid-1990s, he produced techno tracks for a side project called Nerve Filter which generated some interest at record label 21st Circuitry. The first \\"official\\" release of an Assemblage 23 song occurred when Arts Industria released \\"Graverobber\\" on their Construction No. 009 compilation. Shear kept writing Assemblage 23 songs and sending out demos despite his frustration over the lack of interest among record labels, later crediting the support and encouragement from his early fans for keeping him going. In 1998, his perseverance paid off when the Canadian label Gashed! signed Assemblage 23 and released the group's first album, Contempt, in 1999. That same year, Shear's father committed suicide, and the resulting pain and loss is evident in the second album, Failure, released in 2001. Both albums achieved significant critical acclaim as well as popularity at dance clubs. Shear left Gashed Records to sign with Metropolis Records, which re-released Contempt and Failure, and released the third album, Defiance, in 2002, and the fourth, Storm, in 2004. A track from Storm, \\"Let the Wind Erase Me\\", appeared on the Billboard Hot Dance singles chart. Shear is also producer for the band backandtotheleft, and released their album Obsolete on his own label, 23db, in 2004 (later to be rereleased on Metropolis). He has also been known to act as guest vocalist for other musicians. In 2004, Shear also lent his talents to the band The Parallel Project. Shear describes his sound as \\"melodic, danceable electronic music\\".

Despite this slight shift in emphasis and a post-war setting, The Seventh Bullet is closer to a typical war film than other Red Westerns because of a prominence of tactical resourcefulness in the development of the plot. Although of course this is a staple of many American Westerns from John Ford's cavalry series to the many Apache war films. Despite the restoration of Soviet power in the area, Basmachis continue to arrive from across the border, bringing death and destruction to peaceful villages. One of the bands of rebels is led by Khairulla who is pitted against the militsiya (local militia) leader Maxumov. At first it seems hopeless for Maxumov as the rebels capture most of his men, winning them over to his side. He has only one strategy left; to give himself up, and try to explain to the people that Khairulla has deceived them, turning the soldiers back to revolution.

He has released six studio albums to date: Small Moments, The Big Romance, Square 1, The Black and Red Notebook, Not Fade Away and The Nightsaver. He is the son of former Irish politician Tom Kitt. History Kitt grew up surrounded by music, as his father and uncles formed a successful touring folk group when he was young. He began performing live sets while studying at Trinity College Dublin, where he completed a postgraduate course in music technology. He then recorded and mixed the eight tracks of his debut release, Small Moments, in his bedroom, releasing it in August 2000. This album was followed up less than a year later with The Big Romance, in May 2001. This album achieved double platinum sales in Ireland. Following this, Kitt's 2003 third album, Square 1, went straight to number one in Ireland and remained in that position for three weeks. Despite this success, the album failed to make the same impact in the UK, due in a large part to the lack of promotion by then label Universal. In October 2005, Kitt released The Black and Red Notebook, a collection of covers, on Rough Trade Records. His next album of original material, Not Fade Away, was produced by Kitt and Karl Odlum and was issued on 30 October 2006. Kitt also released a special limited CD, Misfits Volume 1, in 2007, the first instalment in a series featuring rare and unreleased tracks which did not make his official album releases. In late September 2008, Kitt announced the title of his new album, The Nightsaver, and began promoting it by supporting Tindersticks on their Irish gigs and subsequent European tour in early 2009.

Because his father, John Krall, was a Naval aviator, and his mother, Vietnamese-born Yung Krall, was a spy for the CIA, Lance spent most of his life moving from country to country and state to state. Government and military life shuffled Lance and his family to California, Hawaii, Saigon, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Washington DC and New Mexico. Lance's family finally retired from government life in 1983 and settled in Georgia. Lance attended Shiloh High School and Georgia State University.https://www.amazon.com/Thousand-Tears-Falling-Yung- Krall/dp/1517022630  Career  After getting his BA in Film and Theater at Georgia State University, Krall helped found The Whole World Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia.

It is located in the north-east of the island. Mostly rural, the municipality stretches for 30 square kilometers from the volcanic peaks that rise in the center of the island to the Atlantic shore. The municipality seat, also called Tacoronte, lies about 16 km west of the capital, Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Old manorial houses and farms are situated here, as well as vineyards that produce the wine known as Tacoronte-Acentejo. The TF-5 motorway passes through the municipality. The Tenerife North Airport is 4 km to the east. Tacoronte is a toponym of Guanche origin, believed to be derived from Tagoror, meaning \\"place where the Council of Elders meets\\". Its territory constituted an ancient menceyato, as the Guanche kingdoms were known, ruled by the mencey Acaymo. After the Spanish conquest of Tenerife, the area was settled by the Portuguese Sebasti√°n Machado, who founded the town of Tacoronte around the hermitage of Santa Catalina that he had built. The town grew during succeeding centuries and in 1911, Alfonso XIII of Spain granted the town the status of municipio.

He briefly served as the Acting President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines and Acting Commander- in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines during World War II, on behalf of President Quezon after the government went in exile to the United States. After about two months, he was executed by the Japanese forces for refusing to cooperate during their occupation of the country. Together with Josefa Llanes- Escoda and Vicente Lim, he is memorialized on the Philippines' 1,000-Peso banknote depicting Filipinos who fought and died resisting the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during the Second World War. Early life and career Jos√© Abad Santos was born in San Fernando, Pampanga, to Vicente Abad Santos and Toribia Basco. His brother Pedro eventually emerged as a leading socialist leader during the Commonwealth era. In 1904, he was sent to the United States as a government pensioner. He finished a pre-law course at the Santa Clara College in Santa Clara, California; his Bachelor of Laws at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois; and his Masters of Laws at George Washington University in 1909. He was admitted to the Philippine Bar in 1911 and later served as Assistant Attorney at the Bureau of Justice from 1913 to 1917. In 1919, Abad Santos was instrumental in laying the legal groundwork, as well as drafting the by-laws and constitution of the Philippine Women's University, the country and Asia's first private non-sectarian women's institute of higher learning. A staunch Methodist, Abad Santos worshiped at Central United Methodist Church along T.M. Kalaw Street in Ermita, Manila (then known as the Central Methodist Episcopal Church). Abad Santos was a freemason and a member of the Upsilon Sigma Phi fraternity. Government serviceDepartment of Justice= He was later appointed as the first Filipino corporate lawyer of the Philippine National Bank, Manila Railroad Company and other government corporations. He went to the Department of Justice where he became Attorney-General, Undersecretary of Justice then Secretary of Justice from 1921 to 1923. In July 1923, he resigned as Secretary of Justice together with other department secretaries as a result of the controversy between Governor-General Leonard Wood and Filipino leaders. =Chief Counsel and Supreme Court= Abad Santos then served as Chief Counsel of the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines. In 1926, he went to the United States as head of the Philippine Educational Mission. He was again appointed Secretary of Justice in 1928 and re-appointed on July 1, 1931. In 1932, he became an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. He became its Chief Justice on December 24, 1941. As part of the emergency reorganization of the Commonwealth government, Abad Santos, in his capacity as Chief Justice, was given the responsibilities previously handled by the Secretary of Justice (the position of Secretary of Justice was abolished for the duration of the war). Abad Santos accompanied the Commonwealth government to Corregidor, where on December 30, 1941, he administered the oath of office to President Quezon and Vice-President Osme√±a for the second term they'd been elected to in November of that year. He also undertook, with Manuel Roxas, the supervision of the destruction of Commonwealth government currency to prevent its falling into enemy hands. World War II With the Japanese invasion rapidly advancing to the southern part of the Philippines, President Manuel L. Quezon was advised by General Douglas MacArthur to establish a government in exile to the United States, Quezon invited Chief Justice Abad Santos to leave with him. The latter declined preferring to remain in the Philippines and carry on his work and stay with his family. On March 17, 1942 the day of Quezon's departure at Zamboanguita, Negros Oriental for the US by way of Australia, he appointed Abad Santos as the Acting President with full authority to act in the name of, and on behalf of the President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines and become the Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines in some areas unoccupied by the Japanese. =Capture and execution= On April 11, 1942, Abad Santos, his son Jos√© Jr. (nicknamed Pepito), Col. Benito Valeriano and two enlisted men were captured by the Japanese in barangay Tubod in Barili, Cebu while traveling by automobile to Toledo, Cebu.(2013-04-03). \\"The execution of Jose Abad Santos\\". Official Gazette of the President of the Philippines. Retrieved on 2013-10-28. He identified himself as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. He and his son were then taken to a concentration camp in Basak San Nicolas, Cebu City. When asked to cooperate with the Japanese, he refused. Although he had nothing to do with military operations, they imputed to him, as acting president, the destruction of the bridges and other public works in Cebu that had been undertaken by the USAFFE forces to delay the invasion of the island. The Japanese High Commander Kiyotake Kawaguchi took him and his son aboard a ship on April 26, 1942, thinking they were heading to Manila. Instead, they arrived on April 28 at Parang, Cotabato (now in Maguindanao). The next day they were brought to Malabang, Lanao, arriving on April 30. After two days' confinement at Japanese camps, Chief Justice Abad Santos was called in front of Kawaguchi and was informed about the order of his execution. Before he was shot to death, he was able to talk to his son Pepito. His last parting words to his son were, \\"Do not cry, Pepito, show to these people that you are brave. It is an honor to die for one's country. Not everybody has that chance.\\" Jos√© Abad Santos was executed at 2:00 p.m., on May 2, 1942, under a tall coconut tree near a river bank. He refused to be blindfolded and refused the last cigarette offered to him. =Grave site= Later that afternoon of May 2, 1942, two Japanese interpreters took Jos√©'s son, Pepito, to his father's grave. It was a small mound‚Äîtoo small, Pepito thought, to hold his father's remains if properly buried. On top of the grave lay a rock as large as a coconut. Pepito begged that he be allowed to mark the grave with a cross, but his request was denied. After the war, an intensive search for the place where Jos√© was buried failed. Pepito did not find the hut and the trees, which would have served as points of reference for locating the grave. The area where the execution took place had been plowed and planted to root crops. =Date of execution= The date of his execution is often reported as May 2, but as former Supreme Court Justice Ram√≥n C. Aquino, Abad Santos's biographer put it, \\"This (May 2) was the date given by Pepito himself during his testimony at the trials of Generals Yoshihide Hayashi and Kiyotake Kawaguchi. But on the basis of the testimony of Keiji Fukui, the interpreter during Abad Santos's confinement, supported by notations in his diary, the date of Abad Santos's execution was definitely ascertained to be at two o'clock on the afternoon of May 2, 1942.\\"Aquino 1985, pg. 215.

The electron donor amino acid is oxidised to a volatile carboxylic acid one carbon atom shorter than the original amino acid. For example, alanine with a three carbon chain is converted to acetate with two carbons. The electron acceptor amino acid is reduced to a volatile carboxylic acid the same length as the original amino acid. For example, glycine with two carbons is converted to acetate. In this way, amino acid fermenting microbes can avoid using hydrogen ions as electron acceptors to produce hydrogen gas. Amino acids can be Stickland acceptors, Stickland donors, or act as both donor and acceptor. Only histidine cannot be fermented by Stickland reactions, and is oxidised. With a typical amino acid mix, there is a 10% shortfall in Stickland acceptors, which results in hydrogen production. Under very low hydrogen partial pressures, increased uncoupled anaerobic oxidation has also been observed. It occurs in proteolytic clostridiums such as: C. perfringens, C. difficile, C. sporogenes, and C. botulinum. Additionally, sarcosine and betaine can act as electron acceptors.

Discovery  In the 1950s two nucleosides were isolated from the Caribbean sponge Tethya crypta: spongothymidine and spongouridine; which contained D-arabinose rather than D-ribose. These compounds led to the synthesis of a new generation, sugar modified nucleoside analog vidarabine, and the related compound cytarabine. In 2004 these were the only marine related compounds in clinical use.Kijjoa, A.; Sawangwong, P. Drugs and Cosmetics from the Sea. Mar. Drugs. 2004, 2, 73-82. The drug was first synthesized in 1960 in the Bernard Randall Baker lab at the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International). The drug was originally intended as an anti-cancer drug. The anti-viral activity of vidarabine was first described by M. Privat de Garilhe and J. De Rudder in 1964.Field, H. J.; De Clercq, E. Antiviral Drugs ‚Äì a short history of their discovery and development. Microbiology Today. 2004, 31, 58-61. It was the first nucleoside analog antiviral to be given systemically and was the first agent to be licensed for the treatment of systematic herpes virus infection in humans.White, O. D.; Fenner, F. J. Medicinal Virology. 3rd Ed. It was University of Alabama at Birmingham researcher and physician Richard J. Whitley in 1976 where the clinical effectiveness of vidarabine was first realized, and vidarabine was used in the treatment of many viral diseases. Vidarabine is an analog of adenosine with the D-ribose replaced with D-arabinose. As you can see from figure 1.1 that it is a stereoisomer of adenosine. It has a half-life of 60 minutes, and its solubility is 0.05%, and is able to cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier (BBB) when converted to its active metabolite.Waterson, A. P. Recent Advances in Clinical Virology (2).  Mode of action  580px The Mechanism of action of vidarabine Vidarabine works by interfering with the synthesis of viral DNA.Merck Manual. 17th Ed. Chapter 154, p.1127-1128. It is a nucleoside analog and therefore has to be phosphorylated to be active. This is a three-step process in which vidarabine is sequentially phosphorylated by kinases to the triphosphate ara-ATP. This is the active form of vidarabine and is both an inhibitor and a substrate of viral DNA polymerase.McGuigan, C. Antiviral Chemotherapy ‚Äì Cardiff University, 3rd Year Pharmacy Notes Lecture Notes. When used as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase, ara-ATP competitively inhibits dATP leading to the formation of ‚Äòfaulty‚Äô DNA. This is where ara-ATP is incorporated into the DNA strand replacing many of the adenosine bases. This results in the prevention of DNA synthesis, as phosphodiester bridges can no longer to be built, destabilizing the strand. Vidarabine triphosphate (ara-ATP) also inhibits RNA polyadenylation; preventing polyadenylation essential for HIV-1 and other retroviruses; and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, preventing transmethylation reactions. Uniquely to vidarabine, the diphosphorylated vidarabine (ara-ADP) also has an inhibitory effect. Other nucleoside analogs need to be triphosphorlated to give any antiviral effect, but ara-ADP inhibits the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. This prevents the reduction of nucleotide diphosphates, causing a reduction of viral replication.  Mode of resistance  Vidarabine is more toxic and less metabolically stable than many of the other current antivirals such as acyclovir and ganciclovir. Viral strains resistant to vidarabine show changes in DNA polymerase. It is prone to deamination by adenosine deaminase to inosine.Whitley, R. J.; Tucker, B. C.; Kinkel, A. W.; Barton, N.

This metabolite still possesses antiviral activity, but is 10-fold less potent than vidarabine.Burgers Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery. 6th Ed. 60% of vidarabine eliminated by the kidney is excreted as 9-Œ≤-D- arabinofuranosylhypoxanthine in the urine. Some breakdown of the purine ring may also occur, forming uric acid. Structural modifications of vidarabine have proven partially effective at blocking deamination, such as replacement of the amine with a methoxy group (ara-M). This results in about a 10-fold greater selectivity against Varicella Zoster Virus than ara-A, however analog of vidarabine is inactive against other viruses due to it not being able to be phosphorylated. The use of an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase to increase the half-life of vidarabine has also been tried, and drugs such as dCF and EHNA have been used with a small amount of success.  Synthesis, preparation and isolation  Chemical synthesis of Vidarabine was first attained in 1960, as a part of studies on developing potential anticancer agents by B. R. Baker et al.Lee, W.

Furthermore, replacement of adenine with 2-fluoroadenine in the enzymatic transglycosylation reaction from ara-U to the 9-position of adenine made it bring about efficient synthesis of 2-fluoro-9-Œ≤-D- arabinofuranosyladenine (fludarabine).Caprioli, G; Colombo, P.; Farina, P.; Petricciani, L A process for the preparation of fludarabine phosphate from 2-fluroroadenine, EP1464708 A1, Oct. 6, 2004.  Selectivity  Vidarabine is less susceptible to the development of drug resistant strains than other antivirals such as IDU, and has been used successfully in the treatment of IDU resistant viral strains. The half-life of the active triphosphate metabolite (ara-ATP) is three times longer in HSV-infected cells compared with uninfected cells, however the mechanism of selectivity is not known.  Clinical indication  Vidarabine is an antiviral, active against herpes viruses, poxviruses, rhabdoviruses, hepadnaviruses and some RNA tumour viruses. A 3% ophthalmic ointment Vira-A is used in the treatment of acute keratoconjunctivitis and recurrent superficial keratitis caused by HSV-1 and HSV-2.Drug Information Online - https://www.drugs.com/MMX/Vidarabine.html Vidarabine is also used to treat herpes zoster in AIDS patients, reducing lesions formation and the duration of viral shedding. Many of the previous uses of vidarabine have been superseded by acyclovir, due to the hospitalisation required for intra venous dosing, and acyclovir has a higher selectivity, lower inhibitory concentration and higher potency. Toxic side effects are rare, but have been reported with high concentrations of vidarabine, such as nausea, vomiting, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving high intravenous doses daily.

He is credited with proposing the distinction between semantic and episodic memory. Tulving is a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. In 2006, he was named an Officer of the Order of Canada, Canada's highest civilian honour. Biography Tulving was born in Tartu, Estonia, in 1927. In 1944, after the Soviet Army entered Estonia, Tulving (then 17 years old) and his younger brother Hannes were separated from their family and sent to live in Germany. In Germany, he finished high school and worked as a teacher and interpreter for the U.S. army. He briefly studied medicine at Heidelberg before he immigrated to Canada in 1949. In 1950, he married Ruth Mikkelsaar, a fellow Estonian from Tartu whom he had met at a refugee camp in Germany. They had three daughters: Elo Ann, Ruth, and Linda. Tulving completed a bachelor's (1953) and master's degree (1954) from the University of Toronto, and earned a PhD in experimental psychology (1957) from Harvard University. His doctoral dissertation was on the topic of oculomotor adjustments and visual acuity. In 1956, Tulving accepted a lectureship at the University of Toronto as a lecturer, where he would remain for the rest of his career. He served as Chair of the Department of Psychology from 1974 to 1980, and became a Professor in 1985. As of 2019, he holds the titles of Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto and Visiting Professor of Psychology at Washington University in St. Louis.  Research  Tulving has published at least 200 research articles and chapters, and he is widely cited, with an h-index of 69 (as of April, 2010), and in a Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, he ranked as the 36th most cited psychologist of the 20th century. His published works in 1970s were particularly notable because it coincided with the new determination by many cognitive psychologists to confirm their theories in neuroscience using brain-imaging techniques. During this period, Tulving mapped the areas of the brain, which are considered active during the encoding and retrieval of memory, effectively associating the medial temporal lobe and the hippocampus with episodic memory. Tulving has published work on a variety of other topics, including the importance of mental organization of information in memory, a model of brain hemisphere specialization for episodic memory, and discovery of the Tulving- Wiseman function. =Episodic and semantic memory= Tulving first made the distinction between episodic and semantic memory in a 1972 book chapter. Episodic memory is the ability to consciously recollect previous experiences from memory (e.g., recalling a recent family trip to Disney World), whereas semantic memory is the ability to store more general knowledge in memory (e.g., the fact that Disney World is in Florida). This distinction was based on theoretical grounds and experimental psychology findings, and subsequently was linked to different neural systems in the brain by studies of brain damage and neuroimaging techniques. At the time, this type of theorizing represented a major departure from many contemporary theories of human learning and memory, which did not emphasize different kinds of subjective experience or brain systems. Tulving's 1983 book Elements of Episodic Memory elaborated on these concepts, and has been cited over 3000 times. According to Tulving, the ability to travel back and forward in time mentally is unique to humans and this is made possible by the autonoetic consciousness and is the essence of episodic memory. =Encoding specificity principle= Tulving's theory of \\"encoding specificity\\" emphasizes the importance of retrieval cues in accessing episodic memories. The theory states that effective retrieval cues must overlap with the to-be-retrieved memory trace. Because the contents of the memory trace are primarily established during the initial encoding of the experience, retrieval cues will be maximally effective if they are similar to this encoded information. Tulving has dubbed the process through which a retrieval cue activates a stored memory \\"synergistic ecphory\\". One implication of the encoding specificity principle is that forgetting may be caused by the lack of appropriate retrieval cues, as opposed to decay of a memory trace over time or interference from other memories. Another implication is that there is more information stored in memory relative to what can be retrieved at any given point (i.e., availability vs. accessibility). =Amnesia and consciousness= Tulving's research has emphasized the importance of episodic memory for our experience of consciousness and our understanding of time. For example, he conducted studies with the amnesic patient KC, who had relatively normal semantic memory but severely impaired episodic memory due to brain damage from a motorcycle accident. Tulving's work with KC highlighted the central importance of episodic memory for the subjective experience of one's self in time, an ability he dubbed \\"autonoetic consciousness\\". KC lacked this ability, failing to remember prior events and also failing to imagine or plan for the future. Tulving also developed a cognitive task to measure different subjective states in memory, called the \\"remember\\"/\\"know\\" procedure. This task has been used extensively in cognitive psychology and neuroscience. =Implicit memory and priming= Another area where Tulving has had an impact is the distinction between conscious or explicit memory (such as episodic memory) and more automatic forms of implicit memory (such as priming). Along with one of his students, Professor Daniel Schacter, Tulving provided several key experimental findings regarding implicit memory. The distinction between implicit and explicit memory was a topic of debate in the 1980s and 1990s. Tulving and colleagues proposed that these different memory phenomena reflected different brain systems. Others argued that these different memory phenomena reflected different psychological processes, rather than different memory systems. These processes would be instantiated in the brain, but they might reflect different aspects of performance from the same memory system, triggered by different task conditions. More recently, theorists have come to adopt components of each of these perspectives. Estonian Studies Foundation In 1982, architect Elmar Tamp√µld proposed the idea of reinvesting Tartu College's surplus revenues for the founding of a Chair of Estonian Studies at the University of Toronto. The university agreed and in 1983, he helped establish the Chair of Estonian Studies Foundation with fellow expatriate Estonian professors, Endel Tulving and chemical engineer Olev Tr√§ss. The three men made the initial presentation to the University of Toronto and Tamp√µld became the Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Chair of Estonian Studies Foundation.University of Toronto: Estonian Studies Programme Since 1999, J√ºri Kivim√§e, Professor of History and Chair of Estonian Studies has headed the University of Toronto's Elmar Tamp√µld Chair of Estonian Studies.University of Tartu  Honours and awards  Tulving is a member of seven distinguished societies: Fellow, Royal Society of Canada; Foreign Member, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Fellow, Royal Society of London; Foreign Honorary Member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences; Foreign Associate, National Academy of Sciences; Foreign Member, Academia Europaea; and Foreign Member, Estonian Academy of Sciences.

Ricketts, Eric Dinerstein, David M. Olson, Colby J. Loucks, et al. 1999. Terrestrial Ecoregions of North America: a Conservation Assessment. Island Press, Washington DC. This ecoregion occupies the western portion of the Baja California peninsula, and occupies most of the Mexican states of Baja California Sur and Baja California. It covers 77,700 square kilometers (30,000 square miles). The climate is dry, but its proximity of the Pacific Ocean provides humidity and moderates the temperature. The flora mostly consists of xeric shrubs and over 500 species of recorded vascular plants. Geography The Baja California Desert ecoregion lies on the western portion of the Baja California Peninsula and occupies most of the Mexican states of Baja California and Baja California Sur. The ecoregion covers 77,700 square kilometers (30,000 square miles) and includes most of the Peninsula's western slope. It is bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the east by the Peninsular Ranges, and extends from approximately 31¬∫ to 24¬∫ N. Elevations vary, and include mountain ranges on the western central part (1000 - 1500m), plains of middle elevation (300 ‚Äì 600m), and vast extensions of coastal dunes. North of 30¬∞ north latitude on the Pacific slope, the Baja California desert transitions to the California coastal sage and chaparral. The Sierra Ju√°rez and San Pedro M√°rtir pine-oak forests occupy the higher Peninsular Ranges to the north, where a number of tree species are found including the near-threatened California fan palm.C. Michael Hogan. 2009. California Fan Palm: Washingtonia filifera, GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. Nicklas Stromberg The Sonoran Desert lies to the northeast. The Gulf of California xeric scrub lies east of the Peninsular Ranges and to the south. Climate The climate is dry and mostly subtropical with the southernmost parts being tropical. Although rainfall is low, the Pacific Ocean provides some humidity and moderates the temperature compared to the Sonoran desert, which lies on the east slope of the Peninsular Ranges. Flora The ecoregion is mostly covered by xeric shrubs, which create varying associations based on elevation and soil conditions. The ecoregion has close to 500 species of vascular plants, of which a number are endemic, for example the Boojum tree (Fouquieria columnaris) or Creeping Devil (Stenocereus eruca). Fauna The ecoregion has about 50 species of mammals. Large mammals include mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni), puma (Puma concolor), and the critically endangered Baja California pronghorn (Antilocapra americana peninsularis). The San Quintin kangaroo rat (Dipodomys gravipes) and Baja California rock squirrel (Otospermophilus atricapillus) are endemic to the ecoregion. There are about 200 native bird species, including golden eagle (Aguila chrysaetos), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), northern crested caracara (Caracara cheriway), osprey (Pandion haliaeutus), and burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia). Millions of ducks and geese over- winter in the coastal lagoons, including Ojo de Liebre Lagoon, San Ignacio Lagoon, and Magdalena Bay. Protected areas A 2017 assessment found that 45,940 km2, or 60%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas include El Vizca√≠no Biosphere Reserve and Valle de los Cirios Flora and Fauna Protection Area; both protected areas extend into the adjacent Gulf of California xeric scrub ecoregion.

Kennedy from proclaiming the week on the ground that the United States had no reason to make the resolution, which in effect called for the overthrow of all the governments of Eastern Europe, a part of public policy. Russian emigres to the United States (specifically representatives of the Congress of Russian Americans) argued that the Captive Nations Week was anti-Russian rather than anti-Communist since the list of \\"captive nations\\" did not include Russians, thus implying that the blame for the oppression of nations lies on the Russian nation rather than on the Soviet regime (Dobriansky's allegedly Ukrainian nationalist views were named as the reason for this). Members of the Congress have campaigned for nullification of the Captive Nations law. Nevertheless, in his official address on the Captive Nations Week in 1983, President Ronald Reagan quoted Russian dissident writers Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Alexander Herzen. Group of prominent American historians issued a statement claiming that PL 86-90 and the Captive Nations Week was largely based on misinformation and committed the United States to aiding \\"ephemeral\\" nations such as Cossackia and Idel-Ural.

Biography Born as Clarence Beeks in Oakdale, Tennessee, he moved to New York City in the mid-1940s working as a bartender and became a fan of bebop music. King Pleasure first achieved popularity by singing the Eddie Jefferson vocalese classic \\"Moody's Mood For Love\\", based on a 1949 James Moody saxophone solo to \\"I'm In The Mood For Love\\". Pleasure's 1952 recording, his first after signing a contract with the Prestige label, is considered a jazz classic; the female vocalist featured is Blossom Dearie.\\"Moody's Mood For Love: The Story Of A Song\\". He and Betty Carter also recorded a famous vocalese version of \\"Red Top\\", a jazz classic penned by Kansas Citian Ben Kynard and recorded by Gene Ammons and others. Other notable recordings include a presciently elegiac version of \\"Parker's Mood\\", the year before Charlie Parker died in 1955, and Pleasure's take on Ammons's \\"Hittin' The Jug\\", retitled as \\"Swan Blues\\" in 1962. Pleasure has been cited as a significant influence by Van Morrison, especially on his album Astral Weeks. Genya Ravan, drawing big inspiration for her singing from King Pleasure, recorded \\"Moody's Mood For Love\\" with James Moody on her 1972 CBS album Genya Ravan.

Retrieved 26 January 2011. also Leenane, is a village and 1,845 acre townland in northern County Galway, Ireland, on the southern shore of Killary Harbour (one of only three fjords in Ireland), on the northern edge of Connemara. Location Leenaun is situated on the junction of the N59 road, and the R336 road in Connemara. Leenaun lies where the deep u-shaped Maam Valley, bounded by the Devilsmother to the east, and the massif of Leenaun Hill to the west, meets Killary Harbour, Ireland's deepest fjord. Across the fjord from the village, is the massif of Ben Gorm, with the larger massif of Mweelrea behind it; while to the east, lie the scenic Aasleagh falls. The village is on the route of the Western Way long- distance trail and the Wild Atlantic Way. =Bridge loss and replacement= On 18 July 2007, following heavy rain, the only river bridge in the village was swept away, cutting the town in half, and altering some local routes by over 100-kilometres.; the bridge had stood for over 182 years. A permanent replacement bridge was constructed in 2009, with increased traffic capacity. Local amenities In the village are two pubs, a hotel with seaweed baths and two guesthouses, one of which is a former convent of the Sisters of Mercy, with a breakfast room in the former chapel. There is also a caf√©-restaurant and a Sheep and Wool Museum with a shop and its own caf√©, and a post office and shop, as well as a community centre. Within Maam Valley are some ancient woods, and across the fjord is Delphi (the valley of the Bundorragha River is sometimes called the Delphi Valley) in County Mayo, which has a postal address of \\"Leenane, Co. Galway,\\" and which contains both a fishing lodge and a resort hotel and adventure sports centre. Both nearby, on the Erris River which runs into the fjord, and across at Delphi, with a river and two lakes, are active fisheries. The major tourist attraction of Kylemore Abbey lies to the south and the scenic Renvyle-peninsula lies to the south-west. In the media Leenaun was the setting for the 1990 film The Field, and of Martin McDonagh's plays The Beauty Queen of Leenane and The Lonesome West.

She is well known as a Filipino advocate of women's suffrage and was founder of the Girl Scouts of the Philippines. Together with Jos√© Abad Santos and Vicente Lim, she is memorialized on the Philippines' 1,000-Peso banknote depicting Filipinos who fought and died resisting the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during the Second World War at the Far Eastern University in Manila. Early life Josefa was born in Dingras, Ilocos Norte as Josefa Llanes (y) Madamba. She was the eldest of the seven children of Mercedes Madamba and Gabriel Llanes. Josefa's siblings were Florencio, Luisa, Elvira, Rosario, Purita, and Eufrocina. Josefa, called by her nickname Pepa as a child, grew up with an instilled idea of the true Christian service. Her mother was said to be a sweet, loving woman who taught her children the importance of serving the people. This amiable character honed by her mother manifested in many parts of Pepa's life. During her elementary days, Pepa was known to be a sunny, naturally active and precocious student. She also had unyielding importance for education. Josefa was valedictorian in grade school and salutatorian in high school in Dingras Elementary School (Dingras, Ilocos Norte). She went to Philippine Normal School in Manila to earn her teaching degree, and graduated with honors in 1919. While working as a teacher, she earned a high school teacher's certificate from the University of the Philippines in 1922. After obtaining her teacher's certificate, she became a social worker for the Philippine Chapter of the American Red Cross. The Red Cross granted her a scholarship to the United States, where she earned a masteral degree in Sociology from Columbia University in 1925. While in the United States, Josefa joined a group of foreign students who wholeheartedly supported an International House project in New York. During her free time in the International House, she accepted speaking engagements. It was also her practice to wear a Filipiniana dress during her lecture tours to arouse foreigner's interest in Philippines. During her first trip to the United States, while she was at the Women's International League for Peace (1925), she met Antonio Escoda Sr., a businessman from Gandara, Samar whom she later married. They had two children: Maria Theresa (who later became the President of the Cultural Center of the Philippines during the 1980's) and Antonio Jr. Girl Scouts of the Philippines She returned to the Philippines again in the 1940s after undergoing intensified training in Girl Scouting in USA sponsored by the Boy Scouts of the Philippines. Afterwards, she began to train young women to become girl scout leaders, then proceeded to organize the Girl Scouts of the Philippines. On 26 May 1940, President Manuel L. Quezon signed the charter of the Girl Scouts of the Philippines. Josefa became the group's first National Executive. World War II During World War II, Japanese forces invaded the Philippines. By 1944, news of the underground activities of Josefa Llanes Escoda and her husband Antonio reached far and wide. As the Japanese Army pushed deeper in the country, The couple had intensified their activities of supplying medicines, foods, clothes and messages to both Filipino war prisoners and American internees in concentration camps. Lt. Jose L. Llanes, Commander of Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur, said he saw Josefa Llanes Escoda on 14 January 1944 in the presence of her husband, Antonio Escoda. Josefa Llanes Escoda left this final message to Lt. Jose L. Llanes: Antonio was first arrested in June 1944, and Josefa Llanes Escoda was also arrested two months later on 27 August. She was imprisoned in Fort Santiago, the same prison as her husband, who was executed in 1944 along with General Vicente Lim, who was imprisoned with him. On 6 January 1945, Josefa Llanes Escoda was then evidently taken and held in one of the buildings of Far Eastern University occupied by the Japanese. She was last seen alive on January 6, 1945, but severely beaten and weak, and was transferred into a Japanese transport truck. It is presumed that she was executed and buried in an unmarked grave, either in the La Loma Cemetery or Manila Chinese Cemetery, which Japanese forces used as execution and burial grounds for thousands of Filipinos who resisted the Japanese occupation.http://www.executedtoday.com/2008/01/06/1945-josefa-llanes-escoda/ Legacy A street and a building have been named after her and a monument has been dedicated to her memory. She is also named after a road in Ilocos Norte and was depicted on the current 1000-peso bill as one of three Filipinos martyred by the Japanese Armed Forces. The Girl Scouts of the Philippines pay homage to Josefa Llanes Escoda every September 20 by celebrating her birth anniversary with activities that create further awareness of her martyrdom and contribution to youth development. On September 20, 2018, a Google Doodle was created to commemorate her 120th birthday.

He was the son of Langa KaXaba, a Nxumalo king. Legend has it that Zwide's mother, Queen Ntombazi, was a sangoma.  Political life  Around the time Zwide became King, the Nxumalo were growing in military power. Ambitious in expanding Nxumalo supremacy, Zwide was a prominent rival to King Dingiswayo of the Mthethwa and his famous general and prot√©g√©, Shaka kaSenzangakhona, usurper to the Mthethwa throne.  Military actions  Zwide sought to expand his borders, and in 1818 he destroyed the power of the Mthethwa Kingdom, after he had King Dingiswayo killed. He also had a battle with the young Zulu clan at the Battle of Gqokli Hill. He destroyed and overran the neighbouring Khumalo Kingdom and executed their King Mashobana KaMangethe. Mashobana's son and heir Mzilikazi escaped from the Nxumalo and sought refuge with Shaka, who had reformed the remnant Mthethwa clan under his rule. Knowing this, Zwide planned to destroy the Zulu Empire to secure Ndwandwe domination of Zululand. In 1820, he led his army into battle against the Zulu at the Battle of Mhlatuze River. His forces were caught crossing halfway across the Mhlatuze River when the Zulu forces attacked, and the Nxumalo army was scattered. Zwide escaped with a remnant of his clan across the Pongola River. After Zwide and his clansmen escaped, the Zulu attacked the rest of his people, killing many at Mome Gorge, a desolate place. The Zulu attacked the Ndwandwe capital, KwaNongoma. The Zulu victory was the beginning of the Mfecane or the scattering. Zwide's generals fled north, where they established their own kingdoms, such as the Shangane Kingdom in Gaza, formed by General Soshangane.

It was formed in the late 1980s after Mwerinde and Kibweteere claimed that they had seen visions of the Virgin Mary. The five primary leaders were Joseph Kibweteere, Joseph Kasapurari, John Kamagara, Dominic Kataribabo, and Credonia Mwerinde. In early 2000, followers of the religious movement died in a fire and a series of poisonings and killings that was initially considered a group suicide. It was later determined to be a mass murder by the group's leaders after their predictions of the apocalypse failed to come about. In their coverage of that event, BBC News and The New York Times referred to the Movement as a doomsday cult. Beliefs The goals of the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God were to obey the Ten Commandments and preach the word of Jesus Christ. They taught that to avoid damnation in the apocalypse, one had to strictly follow the Commandments. The emphasis on the Commandments was so strong that the group discouraged talking, for fear of breaking the Eighth Commandment, \\"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor\\", and on some days communication was only conducted in sign language. Fasting was conducted regularly, and only one meal was eaten on Fridays and Mondays. Sex was forbidden, as was soap. Movement leaders declared that the apocalypse would occur on December 31, 1999. The group had a strong emphasis on an apocalyptic end time, highlighted by their booklet A Timely Message from Heaven: The End of the Present Time. New members were required to study it and be trained in its text, reading it as many as six times. They also taught that the Virgin Mary had a special role in the end, and that she also communicated with their leadership. They held themselves akin to Noah's Ark, a ship of righteousness in a sea of depravity. The Movement developed a hierarchy of visionaries, topped by Mwerinde. Behind them were former priests who served as theologians and explained their messages. Although the group had split from the Catholic Church, had Catholic icons placed prominently, and defrocked priests and nuns in its leadership, ties to the Church were only tenuous. Background The recent past of Uganda had been marked with political and social turmoil. The rule of Idi Amin, the AIDS pandemic, and the Ugandan Bush War wreaked havoc across the country. People became pessimistic and fatalistic, and the established Roman Catholic Church was backsliding, enveloped in scandals and the faithful were becoming dissatisfied. In this void, many post-Catholic groups formed in the late eighties as a confused and traumatized populace turned to charismatic self- declared messiahs who renounced the authority of the government and the Church. An example of this phenomenon was the Christian resistance group, the Holy Spirit Movement, which fought against the government of Yoweri Museveni. A former member of another unrelated sect, Paul Ikazire, would explain his motivation to join the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, \\"We joined the movement as a protest against the Catholic Church. We had good intentions. The church was backsliding, the priests were covered in scandals and the AIDS scourge was taking its toll on the faithful. The world seemed poised to end.\\" HistoryFounding= The earliest origins of the movement have been traced back to Credonia Mwerinde's father Paolo Kashaku. In 1960 he claimed to have had a vision of his deceased daughter Evangelista, who told him that he would have visions of heaven. This prediction passed in 1988, when he saw Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, and Saint Joseph. His daughter Credonia also had similar visions and was involved in a Virgin Cult. In 1989 Kashaku instructed her to spread the message across Uganda on the orders of the Virgin Mary. In that year she would meet Joseph Kibweteere and tell him of their communications. Joseph Kibweteere claimed to have had a vision of the Virgin Mary in 1984. Credonia Mwerinde also had a similar vision in a cavern near Kibweteere's house in Rwashamaire, Uganda. In 1989 the two met and formed the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, with the mission to spread the Virgin's message about the apocalypse. The group grew rapidly and also attracted several defrocked Catholic priests and nuns who worked as theologians, rationalizing messages from the leadership. Two of the arrivals were the excommunicated priests Paul Ikazire and Dominic Kataribabo. =Middle years= The sect grew in importance with the arrival of Dominic Kataribabo, a respected and popular priest with a PhD from a university in the United States. In order to obtain more funds for the increasing number of disciples, Kibweteere sold his three other properties, car and milling machines. By the late 1990s, the church had grown into a thriving community, set in pineapple and banana plantations. Members lived communally on land bought by pooling their assets, which they sold when they joined the Movement. Mwerinde claimed to receive messages from the Virgin Mary through a hidden telephone system that communicated through everyday objects. In western Uganda they built houses for recruitment, indoctrination and worship, and a primary school. The year 2000 was settled on as the final, compelling date for the sect's predictions of the apocalypse. In 1992 the group was ordered out of Rwashamaire by village elders, and moved to Kanungu District, where Mwerinde's father offered an extensive property for their use. In 1994, Paul Ikazire left the sect, taking with him approximately seventy members. By 1997, according to a filing with the government, the Movement's membership was listed at nearly 5,000 people. In 1998, the Ugandan press reported that the Movement had been shut down for unsanitary conditions, use of child labor, and possibly kidnapping children, but the sect was allowed to reopen by the government. As the new millennium approached preparations for the end mounted. In 1999, the state-owned New Vision newspaper ran an interview with a teenage member. He said, \\"The world ends next year. There is no time to waste. Some of our leaders talk directly to God. Any minute from now, when the end comes, every believer who will be at an as yet undisclosed spot will be saved.\\" =Apocalypse claims= With the new year looming, activity by Movement members became frenzied, their leaders urged them to confess their sins in preparation for the end. Clothes and cattle were sold cheaply, past members were re-recruited, and all work in the fields ceased. January 1, 2000, passed without the advent of the apocalypse, and the Movement began to unravel. Questions were asked of Mwerinde and Kibweteere, and payments to the Church decreased dramatically. Ugandan police believe that some members, who had been required to sell their possessions and turn over the money to the Movement, rebelled and demanded the return of their money. It is believed that events that followed were orchestrated by sect leaders in response to the crisis in the ranks. Another date was immediately predicted. March 17, 2000, was the new end of the world, a doomsday they said would come \\"with ceremony, and finality\\" according to The New York Times. The Movement held a huge party at Kanungu, where they roasted three bulls and drank 70 crates of soft drinks. Minutes after the members arrived at the party, nearby villagers heard an explosion, and the building was gutted in an intense fire that killed all 530 in attendance, including dozens of children. The windows and doors of the building had been boarded up to prevent people from leaving. The fire alerted the Ugandan authorities as to what had been occurring in the Movement. Several days before Movement leader Dominic Kataribabo was seen buying 50 liters of sulfuric acid, which may have started the fire. Another party was planned for the eighteenth, which officials believe sect leaders had announced in order to mislead authorities as to their plans. The five principal cult leaders, Joseph Kibweteere, Joseph Kasapurari, John Kamagara, Dominic Kataribabo, and Credonia Mwerinde, were assumed to have died in the fire. Four days after the church fire, police investigated Movement properties and discovered hundreds of bodies at sites across southern Uganda. Six bodies were discovered sealed in the latrine of the Kanungu compound, as well as 153 bodies at a compound in Buhunage, 155 bodies at Dominic Kataribabo's estate at Rugazi, where they had been poisoned and stabbed, and another 81 bodies lay at leader Joseph Nymurinda's farm. Police stated that they had been murdered about three weeks before the church inferno. =Aftermath= Other than the individuals who died in the fire, medical examiners determined that the majority of dead sect members had been poisoned. Early reports suggested that they had been strangled based on the presence of twisted banana fibers around their necks. After searching all sites, the police concluded that earlier estimates of nearly a thousand dead had been exaggerated, and that the final death toll had settled at 924. After interviews and an investigation were conducted, the police ruled out a cult suicide, and instead consider it to be a mass murder conducted by Movement leadership. They believe that the failure of the doomsday prophecy led to a revolt in the ranks of the sect, and the leaders set a new date with a plan to eliminate their followers. The discovery of bodies at other sites, the fact the church had been boarded up, the presence of incendiaries, and the possible disappearance of sect leaders all point to this theory. Additionally, witnesses said the Movement leadership had never spoken of mass suicide when preparing members for the end of the world. A survivor recalled meeting a devout member of the cult with nails and a hammer on his way after he had left the cult. It is believed he is the one who shut the windows with nails to prevent any one from escaping. The Ugandan government responded with condemnation. President Yoweri Museveni called the event a \\"mass murder by these priests for monetary gain\\". Vice president Dr. Speciosa Wandira Kazibwe said, \\"These were callously, well-orchestrated mass murders perpetrated by a network of diabolic, malevolent criminals masquerading as religious people.\\" Although it was initially assumed that the five leaders died in the fire, police now believe that Joseph Kibweteere and Credonia Mwerinde may still be alive, and have issued an international warrant for their arrest. In 2014, it was announced by the Uganda National Police that there were reports that Kibweteere was hiding in Malawi.

Dundalk's three elementary schools are Egremont Community School, Dundalk & Proton Community School and Highpoint Community School. The high school is Grey Highlands Secondary School, which is located in the nearby town of Flesherton. The village of Dundalk is located on Hwy 10 and is serviced with municipal water and sewers, natural gas (Enbridge), electricity (Hydro One) and cable (Eastlink). Economy Agriculture is the dominant sector of the economy in Southgate. Many of the farms in Southgate have secondary businesses on the farm to service the rural farm community. For the last 20 years, Mennonites have been purchasing farmland in Southgate and have expanded the land base available for agriculture. The supply of agricultural land is expanding in Southgate. The industrial sector is concentrated in the Dundalk area. There are 30 small manufacturers in the rural area around Dundalk, mostly in metal fabrication. A large portion are located on Mennonite farms on the eastern side of Southgate. These manufacturers use CNC equipment such a laser cutters to produce a wide variety of metal parts and products. The Township of Southgate has developed a Eco Park which is 90% sold out. The Park has 2 industries involved in the environment sector: Lystek which produces liquid fertilizer and Gro-Bark which produces soil from compost and wood chips. There have been 6 land sales in the last 2 years. The companies that have purchased properties are planning to build industrial facilities. Currently 18 acres are available for industrial development. Most of the commercial retail businesses are located in downtown Dundalk. There are over 30 businesses in the downtown and another 10 outside the downtown or near Hwy. 10. The Tourism economy is growing in Southgate, focused on the many events held in Holstein and Dundalk. A new tourism experience was developed in 2016 called Butter Tarts & Buggies: Explore the Simpler Life in partnership with Wellington North, Minto, Mapleton and West Grey. It includes the Mennonite culture of Southgate with butter tarts and the local food experience. Culture and Tourism Southgate was settled in the 1850s as a farming area spreading from the settlement roads of Hwy 10 and Hwy 6. The original settlers were from England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales and other European countries. Soon after 2 rail lines were built running north‚Äìsouth near Hwy 10 through Dundalk and Proton Station and Hwy 6 through Holstein. The most recent arrivals in Southgate are Mennonites mostly from the Kitchener-Waterloo area. Southgate has several churches representing Catholic, Anglican, Protestant and Mennonite denominations. Dundalk is the starting point of the Grey County CP Rail Trail, a multi-purpose trail which runs through downtown Dundalk on the old railline to Owen Sound. Dundalk is the hub of the regional ATV and snowmobile networks in the region. The Highpoint Campground is a municipally-owned campground in downtown Dundalk in Dundalk Memorial Park. The village of Dundalk hosts many tourism events including the Dundalk Fair and Canadian Open Dance Competition, Horse Shows, Family Recreation Weekend, Automotive Swap-Meet & Flea Market and Santa Claus Parade. The Dundalk Fair and Canadian Open Dance Competition is held the 2nd weekend of September. The Dance Competition includes step dancing, clogging, square dancing and group step dancing. The Fair is a traditional fall fair which has been held for over 160 years. It includes saddle horse shows, harness racing, demolition derby, tractor pulls, classic car show, garden tractor races, Ambassador of the Fair crowning, amusement rides and over a hundred competitions judging jam to livestock. The village of Holstein hosts many events each year including: the Holstein Maplefest, a Canada Day Fireworks display, Holstein Santa Claus Parade and annual drama productions.

There is also a redesigned model called the Cassette Vision Jr. The term cassette is a contemporary Japanese synonym for ROM cartridge, not to be confused with the magnetic cassette tape format. In terms of power, it is comparable to the Atari 2600. The Cassette Vision has unusual controls: four knobs built into the console itself, two for each player (one for horizontal, one for vertical); plus two buttons per player. The system originally retailed for 13,500 yen, with games priced at 4,000. The Cassette Vision sold around 400,000 units, and was the best selling video game console in Japan before Nintendo's Family Computer. It received a successor called the Super Cassette Vision. As a 1984 machine, the Super Cassette Vision was more comparable to the likes of the Famicom and Sega's SG-1000 line. The SCV was also sold in Europe, but with little known success. The Super Lady Cassette Vision, a version of the Super Cassette Vision that was aimed at a female market, was released exclusively in Japan.

Grand Champion (Top- down racing game) Accessory Lightgun for the Cassette Vision In the same as the launch of the Cassette Vision, Epoch released a Light Gun to go with the Big Sport 12 games. The cartridge contains a collection of 12 games, including 4 that required the use of the light gun. The gun connects to the console via the AUX connector. This is the only accessory available for the Cassette Vision and therefore the only peripheral that use the AUX connection. This connector was later removed when Epoch released the Cassette Vision Jr, a trim down version of the Cassette Vision, making the Gun incompatible with that version of the console. Technical specifications The Cassette Vision Jr., a cost reduced and minimized version of the Cassette Vision released in 1983. Cassette Vision's controllers are integrated into the body. Epoch decided to capitalize on the NEC uPD77xx chipset as they had already used to develop games on this platform (TV Baseball, TV Vader). To achieve this, Epoch decided to put the CPU directly in the cartridge while the shell of the console would only contain the power supply, the controls and the video and sound output. Having the ROM, the RAM and the CPU in one chip, Epoch/NEC were able to create a chip that would support 48 bits instruction which was way faster than systems using a separate ROM at the time. Using 8-bit ROM though a BUS would have divided the speed by 4. Although having only the ROM on the cartridge would have reduced their cost drastically, it would have greatly increased the cost of the console itself, incur more R&D; cost and delay the release of the console.

It resulted in a victory for the Guanches of Tenerife. The Spaniards were under the command of the Adelantado (\\"military governor\\") Alonso Fern√°ndez de Lugo, who had sold his properties in order to finance his conquest of Tenerife. Fern√°ndez de Lugo was aided by the fact that missionaries had already begun to Christianize the Guanches of Tenerife, and several of the Guanches' menceyatos or kingdoms, which included Guimar, Abona, Adeje, and later Anaga, were friendly to the Castilians (and known in Spanish as bandos de paz). Fern√°ndez de Lugo landed at A√±azo, near present-day Santa Cruz de Tenerife, in late April, and built the fortified camp of el Real de Santa Cruz. Advancing towards the interior of the island, Fern√°ndez de Lugo confirmed his friendship with the bandos de paz and attempted to reach the same arrangement with other Guanche menceyatos, including Taoro. Bencomo, the ruler of Taoro, refused Fern√°ndez de Lugo's terms, and instead began to form his own alliance against the Castilians, composed of the menceyatos of Tacoronte, Tegueste, Daute, and Icod. In a state of war, Fern√°ndez de Lugo advanced through present-day San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna to the area known as Acentejo. The Castilians committed the terrible blunder of walking blindly into the ravine now called Barranco de San Antonio (Farfan was its Guanche name), in Acentejo. Despite their technological superiority --the Spaniards, protected with armour and shields, fought with blunderbusses and cannon-- the Guanches, fighting naked, attacked them from the slopes with stones and spears of hardened wood (known as banotes). The Spaniards were unable to maneuver with their horses, because these slopes were covered with very thick, arboreal brush, and the Guanches, who numbered some 3,300 men under the leadership of Bencomo and his half-brother Tinguaro, chief of the comarca of Acentejo, made use of their mobility and intimate knowledge of the terrain to gain the upper hand. While Tinguaro with 300 men ambushed the vanguard of the Castilian forces, Bencomo arrived at the battle with 3,000 men, attacking the rearguard of the dispersed Europeans. It is believed that four out of five Spanish soldiers fell in this battle, leaving 900‚Äì1,000 dead on the battlefield out of the initial 1,120. The defeat was not total, however. Fern√°ndez de Lugo, though wounded, was able to escape with his life (by exchanging the red cape of an Adelantado for that of a common soldier), and his surviving forces (some 200 men) were harried until he was forced to re-embark at A√±azo and sail back to Gran Canaria. The Adelantado was able to return and defeat the native forces in two major battles: the Battle of Aguere and Second Battle of Acentejo, and other minor clashes, such as the Battle of Las Pe√±uelas. A town built on the site where the battle occurred is called La Matanza de Acentejo (\\"The Slaughter of Acentejo\\"), which also contains a large mural commemorating the victory. This was the greatest defeat in the history of the Spanish Atlantic expansion, in terms of casualties suffered by Spain. References * Jos√© Juan Acosta; F√©lix Rodr√≠guez Lorenzo; Carmelo L.

He was the president of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences between 2014 and 2020. He served as president of the International Mathematical Union between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2010.The IMU Executive Committee 2007-2010 Biography Laszl√≥ Lov√°sz was educated in Budapest where he showed outstanding ability in mathematics at secondary school. When he was fourteen years old, Lov√°sz came across an article by Paul Erd≈ës in the Mathematical and Physical Journal for Secondary Schools (1962) and was so enchanted that he read it \\"at least twenty times\\". In the following year, he was able to meet his mathematical hero in person. Inspired by Erd≈ës, Lov√°sz won gold medals in the International Mathematical Olympiad competition in each of the three years 1964, 1965, and 1966. Lov√°sz's first paper \\"On graphs not containing independent circuits\\" was published in 1965 when he was seventeen years old. In this paper, he classified graphs in which any two circuits have a common node. This was not an isolated paper for, in the next couple of years, he published \\"On the decomposition of graphs\\" (1966), \\"Operations with structures\\" (1967),. After graduating from high school, Lov√°sz studied at E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University in Budapest and he was awarded a Candidate Degree of Mathematical Science (C.Sc.) in 1970 by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest. At this time the Candidate's Degree awarded by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences was considered a higher degree than a doctorate awarded by a university so it may appear puzzling that he received this degree first. The reason was that university regulations did not allow a student to apply for a Ph.D. with results achieved during their undergraduate years. No such rules existed in the Academy of Sciences, however, because when the rules were drawn up it was assumed that an undergraduate would never be able to produce research of sufficient depth to entitle him to apply for the C.Sc. degree. Remarkably, Lov√°sz had fifteen papers in print by the time he was awarded his Candidate Degree in 1970. Before the award of any degree, he had lectured at several international conferences and published papers in conference proceedings such as Theory of graphs held in Tihany, on the northern shore of Lake Balaton, in Hungary in September 1966. For his outstanding achievements, Lov√°sz received the Gr√ºnwald G√©za Prize from the Bolyai Society in 1970. In the following year, he was awarded a doctorate (Dr.Rher.Nat.) from E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University in Budapest for his thesis \\"Factors of Graphs\\". His thesis advisor was Tibor Gallai. He was then appointed as a research assistant at E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University, an appointment he held for four years from 1971 to 1975. During this time he spent the year 1972-73 at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee in the United States. In 1975 he moved to the J√≥zsef Attila University in Szeged where he was appointed as a Docent but, three years later, he was promoted to professor filling the Chair of Geometry. In 1977 the Hungarian Academy of Sciences awarded him the degree Dr.Math.Sci. He spent the academic year 1978-79 at the University of Waterloo in Canada then in 1979, at the age of thirty-one, he became a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences making him by far the youngest member ever of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He left Szeged in 1983 when appointed to the Chair of Computer Science at E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University in Budapest. Career Lov√°sz received his Candidate of Sciences (C.Sc.) degree in 1970 at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. His advisor was Tibor Gallai. Until 1975, Lov√°sz worked at E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University, between 1975‚Äì1982, he led the Department of Geometry at the University of Szeged. In 1982, he returned to the E√∂tv√∂s University, where he created the Department of Computer Science.

He was a key founder of Paramount Pictures with Adolph Zukor and William Wadsworth Hodkinson, and father of screenwriter Jesse L. Lasky Jr. Early life Born in to a Jewish family in San Francisco, California, he worked at a variety of jobs but began his entertainment career as a vaudeville performer that led to the motion picture business. Career In 1911, Lasky was the producer of two Broadway musicals: Hello, Paris and A La Broadway. Beatrice deMille was also producing plays on Broadway and she introduced him to her son Cecil B. DeMille. They ventured into motion pictures in 1913. =Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company= Lasky's sister, Blanche, married Samuel Goldwyn and in 1913 Lasky and Goldwyn teamed with Cecil B. DeMille and Oscar Apfel to form the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company. With limited funds, they rented a barn near Los Angeles where they made Hollywood's first feature film, DeMille's The Squaw Man. Known today as the Lasky-DeMille Barn, it is home to the Hollywood Heritage Museum. Other films produced by the studio include the original version of Brewster's Millions, The Call of the North, Cameo Kirby, The Circus Man, The Ghost Breaker, The Making of Bobby Burnit, The Man from Home, The Man on the Box, The Master Mind, The Only Son, The Virginian (all 1914), The Cheat, Carmen, Kindling (all 1915), The Blacklist (1916) and The Bottle Imp (1917). =Famous Players-Lasky, Great Depression, and later partnerships= In 1920, Famous Players-Lasky built a large studio facility in Astoria, New York, now known as the Kaufman Astoria Studios. In 1927, Lasky was one of the 36 people who founded the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Financial problems arose within the industry as a result of the Great Depression and the Famous Players-Lasky Company went into receivership in 1933. Lasky then partnered with Mary Pickford to produce films but within a few years she dissolved their business relationship. Lasky then found work as a producer at one of the big studios until 1945 when he formed his own production company. He made his last film in 1951 and in 1957 published his autobiography, I Blow My Own Horn. Lobby card for Salomy Jane, silent Western produced by Jesse Lasky Death Jesse L. Lasky died at age 77 from a heart attack in Beverly Hills. He is interred in Hollywood Forever Cemetery, adjacent to Paramount Studios, in Hollywood. Legacy For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Lasky has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6433 Hollywood Boulevard. Lasky Drive in Beverly Hills was named in his honor.

Adapted from the 1997 short story of the same name by Annie Proulx, the screenplay was written by Ossana and Larry McMurtry. The film stars Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams, and depicts the complex emotional and sexual relationship between Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist in the American West from 1963 to 1983. Lee became attached to the project after previous attempts to adapt the short story into a film did not materialize. Focus Features and River Road Entertainment would jointly produce and distribute the film. After Ledger and Gyllenhaal's casting was announced in 2003, filming commenced in various locations in Alberta, Canada in 2004. Brokeback Mountain premiered at the 2005 Venice Film Festival and was released to theaters on December 9 that year. Gustavo Santaolalla scored the film's original soundtrack. The film received critical acclaim, in particular for Lee's direction and the performances of Ledger, Gyllenhaal, and Williams. Brokeback Mountain was included on many film critics' 2005 top-ten lists. It was also commercially successful, and grossed $178 million worldwide against its $14 million budget. At the 78th Academy Awards, Brokeback Mountain was nominated for Best Picture and won three awards for Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Original Score. The film garnered seven nominations at the 63rd Golden Globe Awards, and won four awards. At the 59th British Academy Film Awards, Brokeback Mountain was nominated for nine awards, winning Best Film, Best Direction, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (Gyllenhaal). Brokeback Mountain was also a subject of controversies, such as its loss to Crash for the Academy Award for Best Picture, censorship, and criticism from conservative media outlets. The sexuality of the main characters has been subject to discussion. Brokeback Mountain has also been regarded as a turning point for the advancement of queer cinema into the mainstream. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. Plot In 1963, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist are hired by Joe Aguirre to herd his sheep through the summer on the Brokeback mountains. After a night of heavy drinking, Jack makes a pass at a hesitant Ennis, and Ennis eventually responds to Jack's advances. Ennis tells Jack that it was a one-time incident, but they soon develop a passionate sexual and emotional relationship. Eventually, Jack and Ennis part ways; Ennis marries his longtime fianc√©e Alma Beers and has two daughters with her. Jack returns the next summer seeking work, but Aguirre, who had observed Jack and Ennis on the mountain, refuses to rehire him. Jack moves to Texas, where he meets rodeo rider Lureen Newsome and has a son with her. After four years apart, Jack visits Ennis. Upon meeting, the two passionately kiss, which Alma inadvertently observes. Jack broaches the subject of creating a life with Ennis on a small ranch, but Ennis refuses; he is unwilling to abandon his family, and is haunted by a childhood memory of two men being killed for suspected homosexual behavior. Ennis and Jack meet infrequently for fishing trips, while their respective marriages deteriorate. Lureen abandons the rodeo, going into business with her father, which in turn causes Jack to work in sales. Alma and Ennis eventually divorce in 1975. Upon hearing about the divorce, Jack drives to Wyoming and tells Ennis that they should live together, but Ennis refuses to move away from his children. Upset, Jack finds solace with male prostitutes in Mexico. Alma eventually confronts Ennis about the true nature of his relationship with Jack. The couple have an argument, causing Ennis to cease contact with Alma. Ennis goes on to have a brief romantic relationship with a waitress called Cassie. Jack and Lureen befriend another couple, Randall and Lashawn Malone. Jack realizes he may not have a future with Ennis, and responds to Randall's advances. At the end of a fishing trip, Ennis tells Jack that he cannot take any more time off from work to meet him. The pair have an argument, in which they blame each other for not being together. Ennis begins to cry and Jack embraces him. Some time later, Ennis receives a postcard that he had sent to Jack, stamped with \\"Deceased\\". He calls Lureen, who says that Jack died when a car tire accidentally exploded in his face. As Ennis begins to imagine Jack's fate, Lureen tells him that Jack wanted to have his ashes scattered on Brokeback Mountain. Ennis meets Jack's parents and offers to take Jack's ashes to the mountain. The father refuses, preferring to have them interred in a family plot. Ennis goes to Jack's bedroom; Ennis finds his bloodstained shirt in the closet. He discovers Jack kept it hanging with his own shirt from a fight they had that summer. Ennis holds the shirts to his face and silently weeps. Later, a 19-year-old Alma Jr. arrives at Ennis' trailer to tell him that she is engaged. She asks for his blessing and invites him to the wedding. Once Alma Jr. leaves, Ennis goes to his closet where his and Jack's shirts hang together, with a postcard of Brokeback Mountain tacked above them. Teary eyed, he stares at the ensemble for a moment before walking away. Cast Credits adapted from TV Guide. Production Development = Director Ang Lee Screenwriter Diana Ossana discovered Annie Proulx's short story, Brokeback Mountain, in October 1997, just days after its publication. She convinced writing partner Larry McMurty to read it, who thought it was a \\"masterpiece\\". The pair asked Proulx if they could adapt it into a film screenplay; although she did not think that the story would work as a film, she agreed. In a 1999 interview with The Missouri Review, Proulx praised their screenplay. Ossana said that convincing a director and production company to make the film was a challenging and nonstop process. Gus Van Sant attempted to make the film, hoping to cast Matt Damon and Joaquin Phoenix as Ennis and Jack, respectively. Damon, who previously worked with Van Sant on Good Will Hunting, told the director, \\"Gus, I did a gay movie (The Talented Mr. Ripley), then a cowboy movie (All the Pretty Horses). I can't follow it up with a gay-cowboy movie!\\" Instead, Van Sant went on to make the biographical film Milk, based on the life of gay rights activist and politician Harvey Milk. Joel Schumacher was also linked with the project at one point. Focus Features CEO James Schamus optioned the film rights in 2001, but thought it was a risky project. At Ossana's request, Schamus showed the story and screenplay to director Ang Lee. Lee decided to make Hulk instead; his experience of Hulk, and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon from two years prior left him exhausted. In 2003, he considered retirement but Brokeback Mountain came back to his mind and tempted him back into filmmaking. Lee attempted to get the film made as an independent producer. However, this did not work out, and before Lee would take a break after finishing Hulk, he contacted Schamus about Brokeback Mountain. Schamus thought Brokeback Mountain embraces the American West without being a traditional Western, and told Lee that he should consider directing it. Lee said, \\"Towards the end [of the script] ... I got tears in my eyes\\". He was particularly drawn to the authentic rural American life and repression depicted in the story. Bill Pohlad of River Road Entertainment, who had a two-year partnership with Focus Features, helped finance the film. = Casting = Casting director Avy Kaufman said Lee was very decisive about the actors for the lead roles. In 2003, screenwriters Ossana and McMurty suggested Heath Ledger (after being impressed by his performance in Monster's Ball), but the film studio thought he was not masculine enough. Regardless, Kaufman sent the script to Ledger, who thought it was \\"beautiful\\" and put himself forward. Gyllenhaal reacted to the script positively and signed on for the role; he also did not want to miss the opportunity working with Lee and friend Ledger. Gyllenhaal admired Ledger and described him as \\"way beyond his years as a human\\". Other actors were considered for the leads but Lee said they were too afraid to take on the roles. From the beginning, Ledger wanted to portray Ennis and not Jack. He opined that Ennis was more complex; a masculine and homophobic character. Ledger said, \\"The lack of words he [Ennis] had to express himself, his inability to love\\", made the role enjoyable. Ledger, who grew up around horses, researched his character's personal traits, and learned to speak in Wyoming and Texas accents. Lee gave Ledger and Gyllenhaal books about cowboys who were gay or shared similar experiences as the characters depicted in Proulx's book. Ledger and Gyllenhaal also went to a ranch on the outskirts of Los Angeles and learned to ride horses. Gyllenhaal later said: > That what ties these two characters together is not just a love, but a > loneliness. I think primarily it was deep loneliness. And what I always say > about that movie [Brokeback Mountain], which I think maybe over time is more > understood, is that this is about two people desperately looking for love. > To be loved. And who were probably capable of it. And they just found it > with someone of the same sex. And that does not dismiss the fact that it is > about, really, primarily, the first kind of very profound gay love story. > Hopefully it can create an equality of an idea: that is, it's possible that > you can find love anywhere. That intimacy exists in so many places that > convention and society won't always allow us to see. And we won't allow > ourselves to see, because of what criticism ‚Äî and danger, really ‚Äî it might > provoke. Lee interviewed between 20 and 30 actresses for the roles of Alma and Lureen. Michelle Williams was one of the first to audition for the role of Alma, and Lee thought she was perfect for the part. Anne Hathaway, who was filming The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement at the time, showed up to the audition during her lunch break. She was wearing a ball gown and hairpiece \\"that was way over the top\\", but she still felt focused for the audition. At first, Lee did not think she was an obvious choice, but he was convinced with her audition and cast her as Lureen. Hathaway lied to Lee about her knowledge of horse riding in order to cast her. She took lessons for two months to prepare.Logo Movie Special: \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" 2005, TV Movie, Logo, (Interviews with Cast and Crew) December 5 Lee was happy with Ledger and Gyllenhaal portraying Ennis and Jack, respectively, because he thought their \\"young innocence\\" will help carry a love story until the end. Lee added, \\"I think these two are among the best in their age group [...] Jake plays the opposite of Heath and it creates a very good couple in terms of a romantic love story. The chemistry, I think, is great.\\" Once all four leads were cast, Lee remembered being impressed with their maturity despite their young age; \\"It really scared me how good they were\\". = Filming = left Principal photography began in the summer of 2004. While the novel is set in Wyoming, Brokeback Mountain was filmed almost entirely in the Canadian Rockies in southern Alberta. Lee was given a tour of the locations from the story in Wyoming by Proulx, but chose to shoot in Alberta citing financial reasons. The mountain featured in the film is a composite of Mount Lougheed south of the town of Canmore, Fortress and Moose Mountain in Kananaskis Country. The campsites were filmed at Goat Creek, Upper Kananaskis Lake, Elbow Falls and Canyon Creek, also in Alberta. Other scenes were filmed in Cowley, Fort Macleod, and Calgary. Brokeback Mountain production budget was approximately US$14 million. Initially, Alberta's environmental department prohibited the crew from bringing domestic sheep into the Rockies, due to a risk of disease harming the local wildlife. The authorities eventually gave permission for them to shoot on one mountain, as long as they transported the domestic sheep in and out, every day. A biologist was hired to supervise this process. Lee prefers working with cinematographers who are open minded, eager to learn, and able to show an interest in the story and content before talking about the visuals. Therefore, he selected Rodrigo Prieto for the job; saying, \\"I think he‚Äôs versatile, and I wanted somebody who could shoot quickly [...] he was able to give me the tranquil, almost passive look I wanted for Brokeback. I believe a talent‚Äôs a talent\\". Ledger and Gyllenhaal, whom were friends before Brokeback Mountain, were mostly unconcerned with the intimate scenes. The first sex scene between Ennis and Jack took 13 takes to meet Lee's expectation. The director would keep his distance from them during filming, allowing the actors to be free and spontaneous. Lee said, \\"I don't talk too much [to them] except for technical notes. So they [the intimate scenes] are a lot easier to deal with\\". Ledger was observant of Lee's directing style, saying, \\"There‚Äôs two sides to Ang‚Äôs direction ‚Äî there‚Äôs the pre-production, which is incredibly thorough and private, and then there‚Äôs the shooting side, when he just doesn‚Äôt say anything at all.\\" Ledger said that this helped him try harder during takes. Gyllenhaal echoed Ledger's sentiment; \\"He just totally disconnects from you while you're shooting\\", but praised Lee's directorial skills. In regards to acting, Ledger was sometimes disrupted by Gyllenhaal's acting style; Gyllenhaal tended to improvise whereas Ledger preferred to be highly-prepared. The director allowed Ledger to see his performance on the camera monitor so that he could improve. During the last scenes where Ennis meets Jack's parents, production designer Judy Becker was tasked in finding a suitable house. Lee took inspiration from painters Andrew Wyeth and Vilhelm Hammershoi for the white interior walls. Using two cameras, Lee would capture the actors from both angles, and then change lenses and repeat. \\"When you edit it together, you can apply certain emphasis to certain reactions, emotions\\", Lee said. Ossana remembers that the last scenes were emotional for Ledger and personally affected him. The actors who played Jack's parents, Roberta Maxwell and Peter McRobbie, said Ledger was very quiet and gave a \\"powerful performance\\". Executive producer Michael Hausman rented Airstream trailers for the cast and crew to sleep in. He created an on-set atmosphere which mimicked a summer camp, where people could bond and feel close. Hausman recalled that they would sit around the fireplaces, cook food and go fishing on the creek. The production was not without commotion; the cast suffered several injuries during filming. Williams sprained her knee in the early days of filming, therefore, her character's movements were altered to be either sitting or standing most of the time. Ledger also injured his hand when he punched a wall for a scene. During a kissing scene, Ledger almost broke Gyllenhaal's nose. The American Humane raised concerns that animals were treated improperly during filming, alleging that sheep were handled roughly and that an elk appeared to have been \\"shot on cue.\\" They learned that the elk was shot with anesthetic, violating standard guidelines for animal handling in the film industry. During post-production, Geraldine Peroni and Dylan Tichenor served as film editors, but Peroni died in August 2004 and Tichenor took over. The pair relied on Media Composer for editing, and sound engineer Eugene Gearty used Pro Tools for the creation of sound effects. Buzz Image Group were hired to create 75 visual effect shots, including computer-generated clouds, landscapes and sheep. For the film's theatrical poster, Schamus took inspiration from James Cameron's Titanic, which depicts two star-crossed lovers. = Music = Gustavo Santaolalla scored the film's soundtrack, which consists of seventeen tracks as well as songs from Bob Dylan and Roger Miller. The album was released on October 25, 2005. Based on the story and one conversation with the director, Santaolalla was able to score the music before filming began. He said, \\"I mean if you are connected to the story and to the director, it makes a lot of sense because somehow you know, the music then becomes a part of the fabric of that film from the very beginning.\\" He also used a real orchestra and played his own guitar. ReleaseBox office= The film received a limited release in the United States on December 9, 2005, and grossed $547,425 in its first weekend. Over the Christmas weekend, and beginning of January 2006, the film expanded into more domestic theaters. On January 20, the film opened in 1,194 theaters, then 1,652 theaters on January 27, and 2,089 theaters on February 3, its widest release. Brokeback Mountain was released in one theater in London on December 30 and received a wider release in the United Kingdom on January 6, 2006. The film was released in France on January 18, to 155 theaters, expanding to 290 by the third week. In its first week of release, Brokeback Mountain was in third place at the French box office. In Italy, the film grossed more than 890,000 in three days and was the fourth highest-grossing film in its first week. The film was released in Australia on January 26, where it ranked fourth place at the weekend box office. Brokeback Mountain was released in many other countries during the first three months of 2006. During its first week of release in Hong Kong, Brokeback Mountain was ranked first place at the box office, earning more than US$473,868 ($22,565 per theater). The film opened in Lee's native Taiwan on January 20. The film grossed $83 million in North America and $95 million internationally, for a worldwide $178 million. It is the highest-grossing release for Focus Features. = International distribution = The film has been given different titles in accordance to different languages and regions. For the film's release in French and Italian, it was titled Le Secret de Brokeback Mountain and I segreti di Brokeback Mountain (The Secret(s) of Brokeback Mountain), respectively. In Canadian French, the title is Souvenirs de Brokeback Mountain (Memories of Brokeback Mountain). The film received two Spanish titles: Brokeback Mountain: En terreno vedado (In a forbidden terrain) for its release in Spain and Secreto en la Monta√±a (Secret in the mountain) for its release in Latin America. In Hungarian, the title was T√∫l a bar√°ts√°gon (Beyond friendship).The film was met with mixed responses in some regions, particularly China and Islamic nations of western Asia. According to reports, the film was not shown in theaters in China, though it was freely available in bootleg DVD and VHS. The Chinese government said the audience would have been too small; the foreign media accused the government of censorship. The word \\"brokeback\\" () also entered the Chinese lexicon as a slang for homosexuality. The film was dubbed \\"the gay cowboy movie\\" by the press, a term that was propelled into the American vernacular. In the Middle East, distribution of the film became a political issue. Homosexuality is considered a crime in most Islamic nations and is taboo in the few countries where it is legal. Lebanon was the only Arab country to show the film, although in a censored format. The film was also released in Turkey. The film was officially banned from screenings in the United Arab Emirates; however, the DVD of the film was permitted to be rented from stores such as Blockbuster Video. On December 8, 2008, the Italian state-owned television channel Rai Due aired a censored version of the film, removing all the scenes with homoerotic references. Viewers protested, saying the deletions made the plot hard to follow. The Arcigay organisation accused the channel for homophobic censorship. The state- owned television network RAI said the Italian film distributor had mistakenly censored the film. RAI showed an uncensored version of the film on March 17, 2009. = Home media = Brokeback Mountain was the first major film to be released simultaneously on both DVD and digital download via the Internet. It was released in the United States on April 4, 2006. More than 1 million copies of the DVD were sold in the first week, and it was the third biggest seller of the week behind Disney's The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and King Kong. Although the ranking fluctuated daily, by late March and early April 2006, Brokeback Mountain had been the top-selling DVD on Amazon.com for several days running. Reference content retrieved on July 23, 2007, no longer supports Amazon.com sales ranking statement. The DVD in Europe was released in the UK on April 24, 2006. This was followed by France in July, and Poland in September, a considerable time after the theater release in both countries. Brokeback Mountain was re-released in a collector's edition on January 23, 2007. On the same day, it was also released in HD DVD format. The film was released on Blu-ray in the UK on August 13, 2007, and in the U.S. on March 10, 2009. The Blu-ray contains special features including interviews with the screenwriters, director and a short documentary about composer Gustavo Santaolalla. = Critical response= Brokeback Mountain opened to positive reviews upon its release. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 87% based on 246 reviews, with an average rating of 8.17/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"A beautifully epic Western, Brokeback Mountains gay love story is imbued with heartbreaking universality, helped by the moving performances of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a rating of 87/100 based on 41 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim.\\" David Ansen of Newsweek gave the film a positive review, praising the faithful screenplay. He adds, \\"There's neither coyness nor self-importance in Brokeback Mountain‚Äîjust close, compassionate observation, deeply committed performances, a bone-deep feeling for hardscrabble Western lives. Few films have captured so acutely the desolation of frustrated, repressed passion.\\" Writing for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw praised Ledger and Gyllenhaal for their complementary performances. Bradshaw thought the film was \\"extremely moving, tragic even, and sensitive towards the feelings of the simple wives who attempt to understand their troubled husbands.\\" Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post was equally positive, opining that the two lead actors' performances was unforgettable. In particular, she thought Ledger was impressive in his portrayal of a reserved and emotionally affected Ennis. Hornaday also praised the costumes and sets, writing \\"The Wyoming vistas are flawlessly manicured, Ledger and Gyllenhaal perfectly costumed and coiffed; even Ennis and Alma's sad little apartment over a laundromat seems to have been designed to death.\\" Roger Ebert gave the Brokeback Mountain a maximum rating of four stars in his review. Ebert was impressed with the level of attention to the characters, and thought that the film was as observant as the work by Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman. Writing for The Sydney Morning Herald, Sandra Hall praised the screenplay and called Ledger and Gyllenhaal \\"finely tuned\\". Noting that it is a slow film, Hall thought the filmmakers had adapted Proulx's story without missing any nuances. USA Todays Mike Clark, observed that Brokeback Mountain was directed and photographed with restraint, and praised its old-fashioned quality, and \\"unassuming but people-oriented\\" nature. The film also received a positive reaction from Christianity Today; the reviewer gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. In a mixed review, Ed Gonzalez of Slant magazine thought the film was too long, and the critic from Time magazine felt that the story became less intense towards the end. Conservative radio host Michael Medved described it as \\"extremely well done\\", but felt the film was pushing the gay agenda. Several conservative political pundits, including commentators Bill O'Reilly, John Gibson, and Cal Thomas, shared Medved's view of the \\"agenda\\". Gibson made jokes about the film on his Fox News Radio program for months after its release. After the death of Ledger in 2008, Gibson was criticized for mocking the deceased actor, and later apologized. Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh has referred to the film as \\"Bareback Mountain\\" and \\"Humpback Mountain\\". Don Imus referred to the film as \\"Fudgepack Mountain\\". Several conservative Christian groups, such as Concerned Women for America (CWA) and Focus on the Family, criticized the film for its subject matter. Following the success of Brokeback Mountain, Capote, and Transamerica at the 2006 Golden Globes Awards, Janice Crouse, a CWA member, cited these films as examples of how \\"the media elites are proving that their pet projects are more important than profit\\", and suggested they were not popular enough to warrant critical acclaim. Film critic Gene Shalit of The Today Show, described the character of Jack Twist as a \\"sexual predator\\" who \\"tracks Ennis down and coaxes him into sporadic trysts.\\" The LGBT media group GLAAD said that Shalit's characterization of Twist was like calling Jack in Titanic a sexual predator due to his romantic pursuit of Rose. Shalit's openly gay son, Peter Shalit, wrote an open letter to GLAAD: \\"He [Gene] may have had an unpopular opinion of a movie that is important to the gay community, but he defamed no one, and he is not a homophobe.\\" Gene Shalit later apologized for his review; \\"I did not intend to use a word that many in the gay community consider incendiary... I certainly had no intention of casting aspersions on anyone in the gay community or on the community itself. I regret any emotional hurt that may have resulted from my review of Brokeback Mountain.\\" Some commentators accused the filmmakers for hiding content about the film in advertising and in public events, such as press conferences and award ceremonies. New York Daily News writer Wayman Wong, Dave Cullen and Daniel Mendelsohn argued that the director, cast, and publicists avoided using the word gay to describe the story, and noted that the film's trailer did not show a kiss between the two men but showed a heterosexual love scene. The film's significance has been attributed to its portrayal of a same-sex relationship focused solely on the characters; it does not refer to the history of the LGBT social movements. It emphasizes the tragic love story aspect, and many critics have compared Ennis and Jack's drama to classic and modern romances such as Romeo and Juliet or Titanic, often using the term star-crossed lovers. Proulx praised the film as \\"huge and powerful, adding, \\"I may be the first writer in America to have a piece of writing make its way to the screen whole and entire.

In a 2016 international poll conducted by BBC, Brokeback Mountain was ranked the 40th greatest film since 2000. = Legal issues = On January 6, 2006, Utah Jazz owner Larry H. Miller removed the film from theaters at the Jordan Commons entertainment complex in Sandy, Utah. Miller said the film's content had no resemblance of a traditional family, which he believed is \\"dangerous\\". Focus Features threatened legal action and announced it would no longer do business with him. On March 23, 2006, Randy Quaid, who portrayed Joe Aguirre in the film, filed a lawsuit against Focus Features for misrepresenting Brokeback Mountain as \\"a low-budget, art house film with no prospect of making any money\\", in order to secure his role for a cheaper rate. On May 4, Quaid's publicist said he dropped the lawsuit as the company agreed to pay him a settlement; the company denies this however. Accolades Brokeback Mountain garnered awards and nominations in a variety of categories, including for its directing, screenplay, acting, original score, and cinematography. At the 78th Academy Awards, Brokeback Mountain was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and won three awards for Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Original Score. The film garnered seven nominations at the 63rd Golden Globe Awards, winning four for Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Drama, Best Director, Best Song, and Best Screenplay. At the 59th British Academy Film Awards, Brokeback Mountain was nominated for nine awards, winning in the categories of Best Film, Best Direction, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor for Jake Gyllenhaal. After Brokeback Mountain lost the Academy Award for Best Picture to Crash, some critics accused the Academy of homophobia and for making a non-groundbreaking choice. Commentators including Kenneth Turan and Nikki Finke derided the Academy's decision, but Roger Ebert defended the decision to award Crash Best Picture, arguing that the better film won. Ebert questioned why critics were not acknowledging other nominees and appeared to be only criticizing Crash because it won over Brokeback Mountain. Proulx wrote an essay expressing disappointment in the film not winning Best Picture. She also opined that Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance in Capote required less effort than that required of the actors in Brokeback Mountain. Following the loss, more than 800 supporters raised up to $26,000 to place an advertisement in the Daily Variety. The advert thanked the filmmakers \\"for transforming countless lives through the most honored film of the year.\\" The film is one of several highly acclaimed LGBT-related films of 2005 to be nominated for critical awards; others include Breakfast on Pluto, Capote, Rent, and Transamerica. It was voted the top film involving homosexual relationships by readers at TheBacklot.com. In 2010, the Independent Film & Television Alliance selected the film as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years. In 2015, The Hollywood Reporter polled Academy members on controversial past decisions, in which Brokeback Mountain won the revote for Best Picture. Discussion on characters' sexuality Critics and the cast and crew disagreed as to whether the film's two protagonists were homosexual, bisexual, heterosexual, or should be free of any sexual orientation classification. The film was frequently referred to in the media as the \\"gay cowboy movie\\", but a number of reviewers noted that both Jack and Ennis were bisexual. Sex researcher Fritz Klein said that the film was \\"a nice film with two main characters who were bisexual\\" and suggested that the character of Jack is more \\"toward the gay side\\" of the spectrum and Ennis is \\"a bit more toward the straight side\\". Gyllenhaal concluded that Ennis and Jack were straight men who \\"develop this love, this bond,\\" saying in a Details interview: \\"I approached the story believing that these are actually two straight guys who fall in love.\\" Ledger told Time magazine in 2005: \\"I don't think Ennis could be labeled as gay. Without Jack Twist, I don't know that he ever would have come out. I think the whole point was that it was two souls that fell in love with each other.\\" Others said they felt the characters' sexuality was meant to be ambiguous. Clarence Patton and Christopher Murray of New York's Gay City News wrote that Ennis and Jack's experiences were metaphors for \\"many men who do not identify as gay or even queer, but who nevertheless have sex with other men\\". Entertainment Weekly wrote that \\"everyone called it 'The Gay Cowboy Movie' until they saw it. In the end, Ang Lee's 2005 love story wasn't gay or straight, just human.\\" Tom Ciorciari of EFilmCritic.com wrote: \\"We later see Jack eagerly engage Lureen sexually, with no explanation as to whether he is bisexual, so in need of physical intimacy that anyone, regardless of gender, will do, or merely very adept at faking it.\\" LGBT non-fiction author Eric Marcus dismissed \\"talk of Ennis and Jack being anything but gay as box office- influenced political correctness intended to steer straight audiences to the film\\". Roger Ebert believed that both characters were gay, but doubted it themselves: \\"Jack is able to accept a little more willingly that he is inescapably gay.\\" Producer James Schamus said, \\"I suppose movies can be Rorschach tests for all of us, but damn if these characters aren't gay to me.\\" Brokeback Mountain author Annie Proulx said, \\"how different readers take the story is a reflection of their own personal values, attitudes, hang-ups.\\" When Ledger and Gyllenhaal were asked if they feared being cast in controversial roles, Ledger stated that he was not afraid of the role, but rather he was concerned that he would not be mature enough as an actor to do the story justice. Gyllenhaal has stated that he is proud of the film and his role, regardless of what the reactions would be. He thinks rumors of him being bisexual are flattering, stating: \\"I'm open to whatever people want to call me. I've never really been attracted to men sexually, but I don't think I would be afraid of it if it happened.\\" Lee described himself as shy upon shooting the first sex scene and found it initially, technically difficult but praised Ledger and Gyllenhaal for their professionalism. Ledger's performance was described by Luke Davies as a difficult and empowering portrayal given the environment of the film: \\"In Brokeback Mountain the vulnerability, the potential for danger, is so great ‚Äì a world so masculine it might destroy you for any aberration ‚Äì that [Ledger's] real brilliance was to bring to the screen a character, Ennis Del Mar, so fundamentally shut down that he is like a bible of unrequited desires, stifled yearnings, lost potential.\\" Despite the film's criticism, it was also regarded as successful in subverting \\"the myth of the American West and its iconic heroes.\\" Responding to how the film challenges the iconic image of the white, male, all American cowboy and allows them to engage with same-sex relationships, author Jim Kitses states: \\"What drives the emotional attack of the film is the inadequacy of its characters to articulate and understand, let alone control, the experience that strikes them like a storm. American cowboys‚Äîof all people‚Äîhave no business falling in love with each other. Practical and conservative types of a rough and ready manhood are by no means ready for man-love.\\" Legacy and impact Brokeback Mountain was lauded as a landmark in LGBT cinema and credited for influencing several films and television shows featuring LGBT themes and characters. In Out at the Movies, Steven Paul Davies explains that as a result of the film's success, \\"most major film studios have been clamouring to get behind new, gay-themed projects... thanks to Brokeback, film financiers will continue to back scripts that don't simply rely on gay stereotypes...and that will certainly be progress.\\" Davies cites Milk, Transamerica, and I Love You Phillip Morris as examples of such films. In 2018, Brokeback Mountain was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". The pair of shirts worn by Ledger's and Gyllenhaal's characters were sold on eBay on February 20, 2006, for US$101,100.51. The shirts were sold to benefit children's charity Variety. The buyer, Tom Gregory, film historian and collector, described the shirts as \\"the ruby slippers of our time,\\" referring to an artifact from The Wizard of Oz film. In 2009, Gregory loaned the shirts to the Autry National Center in Los Angeles for its series, Out West, which explored the history of homosexual, bisexual and transgender people in the Old West. The series included a gallery tour, panel discussions, lectures and performances, with events held in four installments over the course of 12 months. According to the Autry, the series was the \\"first of its kind\\" for a western heritage museum. A book, Beyond Brokeback: The Impact of a Film (2007) is a collection of personal stories of how people were influenced by the story and film, compiled from members of the Ultimate Brokeback Forum website. In an associated Out West series program, the Autry screened Brokeback Mountain in December 2010 to commemorate the film's fifth anniversary and held a staged reading of Beyond Brokeback by historian and Out West organizer Gregory Hinton. Beyond Brokeback has been presented as a staged reading at other venues, such as Roosevelt University in Chicago, on November 13, 2011, together with a panel discussion and screening of the film. An American opera, Brokeback Mountain, was composed by Charles Wuorinen with a libretto by Annie Proulx. Written in English, it premiered at the Teatro Real in Madrid on January 28, 2014. It was championed by impresario Gerard Mortier, who had commissioned it.Andrew Clements, \\"Brokeback Mountain‚ÄîReview\\" , The Guardian (London), January 29, 2014Anthony Tommasini, \\"Operatic Cowboys in Love, Onstage\\" (Review), The New York Times, January 29, 2014 Several years after the film's release, Proulx said she regrets writing the story. She said that people have sent her too much fan fiction presenting alternative plots. Some authors, mostly men claiming to \\"understand men better than I do\\", often send their works.

Tenma means Pegasus and is literally translated from Japanese as Heaven-horse. Character sketch Tenma was a renowned roboticist and the Japanese Minister of Science, who was described by Tezuka in Volume 7 of the manga this way: :\\"Dr. Tenma was born into a long line of horseradish (or potato) farmers, in the particularly unlucky year of the Horse, in Gunma (\\"horse herd\\") prefecture. Real name is Umataro (\\"horse-boy\\"). Graduated from the university of Nerima (\\"walking horse\\"), and though a complete dark horse, through an amazing demonstration of intellectual power rose to be the head of the ministry of science‚Äîin an area of Tokyo known as Takadanobaba, which loosely translates into a \\"high pasture for horses\\". (He is the top researcher in the study of the hippocampus.Haruji, Mori (2003) \\"Âõ≥Ë™¨„ÉªÈâÑËÖï„Ç¢„Éà„É† (Tetsuwan Atom Illustrated)\\" (in Japanese) p.48) Among those wishing to unseat him, he is known as a real horse of a different color.\\" Appearances Tenma appears several times in Astro Boy adventures. He has slightly different roles in each series. =Original manga= When Tenma's nine-year-old son Tobio dies in a car accident, he decides to recreate him as an invincible robot. After living happily for a while with the child robot, Tenma realizes that an artificial child can not replace his son, particularly when he acknowledges that the robot will not grow like a normal child. So, he sells the robot to Hamegg, a robot salesman. The robot eventually ends up performing in a circus. It is here where he is found and adopted by Professor Ochanomizu, who turns him into Astro Boy. Tenma realizes that Astro is amazing and, even though his affection towards the robot begins to return, he knows he can never make amends for his behavior. Still, he helps Astro frequently. He builds robotic parents for Astro, enhances Astro's power to one million horsepower (700 MW) when he fights Pluto, rescues Astro from a Cleopatra robot, and rebuilds Astro after he is destroyed while trying to protect Blue Knight. =1960 television series= In the 1960 television series, Dr. Tenma (having been named Dr. Boyton in the English dub) was the leader of the Institute of Science, who is first introduced in episode 1. When his son, Tobio Tenma (Aster Boyton in the dub), had been killed in a car crash, he was there to see what had happened; having become heartbroken due to the loss of his son, he carried his lifeless body away from the scene of the collision. Some time later, grief drives him insane; he gets the idea of creating a robot in the likeness of his son and has every member of the Institute of Science turn their work towards its creation. The other Institute members comply with his wishes (aware that his sanity is deteriorating), and over the course of a year, his creation is assembled. Dubbing his new robot Astro Boy (Atom in the original), he brings him to life and takes him home to live as his new son. However, as the years go on, Dr. Boyton comes to realize that Astro can never replace his son. Soon afterwards, he sells Astro to \\"The Great Cacciatore\\" (Hamegg in the original) without a care in the world. He is not seen again until episode 97, which marks his last appearance in the series. It has been suggested that Tenma has either been institutionalized or committed suicide. =1980 television series= Doctor Tenma, as he appeared in the 1980 television series In the 1980 anime series, Tenma (again localized as Dr. Boynton in the English versions) does not really reject Astro. Instead, he dismisses him for causing a mess at a boat dinner, after reminding him he was a robot. Astro then gets kidnapped by corrupt circus ringmaster Hamegg, while Tenma tries to get Astro back. The circus is not as harsh and Hamegg not as evil as in the original manga version. Professor Ochanomizu, who came to visit the circus, notices Astro and manages to trick Hamegg into releasing the child robot with the assistance of Kathy, a performer in the circus who showed compassion towards Astro. =2003 television series= In the 2003 series, Tenma, voiced by Dorian Harewood in the English dubbed version, takes the role of the main antagonist. He abandons both Astro and the Ministry in a fit of insanity, after Astro rebels against Tenma's cold behavior in destroying old robots. Later, when Tenma witnesses Astro's heroics, he begins to believe that Astro will be a Messiah figure. He believes that Astro will lead robots to equal standing with humans or he will help them overthrow humans. (The latter belief gradually takes over as the series progresses.) Prior to Astro's first battle with Atlas, Tenma constantly calls Astro \\"Toby\\", the dead son he was supposed to replace. He only recognizes him as a separate entity once Astro corrects him. It soon becomes apparent to Tenma that he himself cannot keep up with Astro due to his humanity. So, in order to keep up with Astro, he builds a robot to spearhead Astro's development. This robot is appropriately named \\"Shadow\\", and is eventually revealed to be a robot double of Tenma himself. In the second-to-last episode of the 2003 series, Astro is very badly damaged and Tenma rebuilds him, but deletes his previous memories so that Astro doesn't remember he's a robot or the adventures he has been on. Astro, however, rejects Tenma a third time for his cold attitude. Because of this, Tenma attempts suicide in the final episode, but is saved by Astro, who forgives him. Afterwards, Tenma wishes he never shut him down in the first place, and that he still loves him. The series ends with Tenma admitting that he was never fit to be his father, after which he is arrested. The final image of Tenma is of him in a jail cell, holding a photograph of his human son Tobio and a photograph of his robotic son Astro. =Feature film= In the 2009 CGI- animated feature film adaptation, Tenma, who is voiced by actor Nicolas Cage, creates Astro Boy after his son Tobio (Toby) is killed in a robot testing accident. (Tenma accidentally locks Tobio in the chamber with an experimental law enforcement machine named Peacekeeper.) Tenma, with the assistance of Doctor Elefun (Dr. O' Shay), creates a robot duplicate of Toby. He outfits the robot with advanced defense capabilities so that he can't be harmed. Then, he copies Tobio's memories into the robot, hoping the robot will be just like his real son. Tenma begins to feel that this robot duplicate is acting strangely, such as when it thinks it feels weird. When he realizes that the robot is not really Tobio, he rejects him. After the robot runs away, he is captured for the power source that Tenma used on him. It is to be extracted from him and put into the Peacekeeper. The robot encourages this decision, accepting that he could never live up to Tenma's expectations. Tenma, however, refuses to have the robot deactivated, acknowledging Astro is his son. Tenma is non- villainous and less mad in the film. Instead, his personality is similar to that of the original manga (although this film version takes considerable liberties with the source material overall). In the film, he reacts similarly as in the manga, realizing that Astro is not his son and rejecting him. However, he does not sell him to Hamegg. The major difference between the character of Tenma in the film and in other versions of Astro Boy is that Tenma comes to accept Astro. Additionally, this version gives him the first name of \\"Bill\\" as oppoed to \\"Umataro\\".

When it was dedicated in 1956, it was the largest of the church's temples, though it has since been surpassed by the Salt Lake Temple due to later expansions.Harrison, Scott. \\"From the Archives: The Los Angeles California Temple\\", Los Angeles Times, 2 January 2019. Retrieved on 17 March 2020. The temple serves 39 stakes in Los Angeles, Ventura, Kern, Santa Barbara, and San Luis Obispo counties. The grounds include a visitors' center, which was renovated in 2010, the Los Angeles Regional Family History Center, both of which are open to the public, and the headquarters of the church's California Los Angeles Mission. History The Los Angeles Temple was announced on March 23, 1937, by church president Heber J. Grant, when the church purchased 24.23 acres (98,000 m2) from the Harold Lloyd Motion Picture Company. Construction was to begin soon thereafter, but financial difficulties relating to the Great Depression and World War II delayed the groundbreaking until 1951. The temple plans were revised at this time to include a priesthood assembly room, an unusual feature in temples built after the Salt Lake Temple. It was also expanded to accommodate an unprecedented 300 patrons per session. This was the first temple with an angel Moroni statue since the Salt Lake Temple. When the statue was installed it faced southeast, as the temple does. It was later turned to face due east at the request of church president David O. McKay. This was the last temple designed to use live actors instead of a film to present the endowment. The motion-picture presentation soon replaced the live actor presentation, and the progressive presentation (in which patrons moved from one room to another) was replaced with stationary ordinance rooms (i.e., patrons remained in a single room for the entire ceremony). In 2003, the temple reverted to a progressive-style presentation of the endowment (but still using a film) and completely renovated the Terrestrial room. The Los Angeles California Temple was closed for renovations in late November 2005, with reopening originally scheduled for May 2006, but eventually delayed until July 11, 2006. The renovation also included a seismic overhaul and a complete redesign and reconstruction of the baptistry, which had long been plagued by mold due to poor ventilation. In 2012 a fire damaged an adjacent building under-construction that was to house the mission president.Zarembo, Alan. \\"Fire damages building at Mormon temple in Westwood\\", Los Angeles Times, 10 January 2012.

Santa Monica Boulevard in the Westwood district of Los Angeles, the temple sits atop a small hill above the intersection of Overland Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard. The well manicured grounds are open to the public and are filled with various plants, including Canary Island Pine trees, several varieties of palm trees, Bird of Paradise trees, olive trees, and rare Chinese Ginkgo trees. At the left and right of the temple are two fountains, and at the front is a large reflection pool. Several family-themed statues further beautify the grounds. In December, the temple grounds are decorated with thousands of multi-colored lights in celebration of Christmas. While not as regionally prominent as the temples in Oakland, San Diego, and Washington, D.C., the temple is still a distinctive feature of the westside of Los Angeles. Numerous church facilities are on its grounds including a meetinghouse, a baseball field, the headquarters of the church's California Los Angeles Mission, and apartments (used by missionaries, temple workers, temple patrons, and visiting church officials). The remaining land of the million-square-foot lot, along Manning Avenue, was subdivided for residential lots, the sale of which considerably offset the expense of constructing the temple.Nichols, Chris. \\"Why Does the Mormon Temple on Santa Monica Have So Much Land?\\", Los Angeles Magazine, 1 August 2018.

The Los Angeles Temple was the first temple explicitly designed for automobile accessibility: with its parking facilities being larger than those of any temple built previously and with no direct pedestrian connection between the front doors and Santa Monica Boulevard. Architecture The Los Angeles Temple in 2006 The temple's architecture is generally Modernist, an aesthetic that extends to the choice of exterior cladding: 146,000 square feet (14,000 m2) of Mo-Sai pre-cast concrete facing, a mixture of crushed quartz and white Portland cement quarried in Utah and Nevada. The very light brown pigmentation of the Mo-Sai blend has the advantage of concealing the thin layer of soot that accumulates on most buildings in Los Angeles. The temple is 369 feet (112 m) long, 269 feet (82 m) wide and has an overall height of 257 feet (78 m). Atop the temple stands a 16-foot (5 m) tall statue of the angel Moroni.Ephron, Amy. \\"Inside the Los Angeles Mormon Temple Visitors‚Äô Center\\", Los Angeles Times, 6 November 2012.

The rooms include a baptistry, celestial room, four ordinance rooms, ten sealing rooms, and an assembly room that stretches the entire length of the temple. The Los Angeles Temple features murals on the walls of its progressive-style ordinance rooms, including the celestial room. The only other temples with celestial room murals are the Idaho Falls Idaho Temple and the first New Zealand Temple.

The image of the map is a variety, called a Segre variety. It is sometimes written as \\\\Sigma_{n,m}. Discussion In the language of linear algebra, for given vector spaces U and V over the same field K, there is a natural way to map their cartesian product to their tensor product. : \\\\varphi: U\\\\times V \\\\to U\\\\otimes V.\\\\ In general, this need not be injective because, for u in U, v in V and any nonzero c in K, : \\\\varphi(u,v) = u\\\\otimes v = cu\\\\otimes c^{-1}v = \\\\varphi(cu, c^{-1}v).\\\\ Considering the underlying projective spaces P(U) and P(V), this mapping becomes a morphism of varieties : \\\\sigma: P(U)\\\\times P(V) \\\\to P(U\\\\otimes V).\\\\ This is not only injective in the set-theoretic sense: it is a closed immersion in the sense of algebraic geometry. That is, one can give a set of equations for the image. Except for notational trouble, it is easy to say what such equations are: they express two ways of factoring products of coordinates from the tensor product, obtained in two different ways as something from U times something from V. This mapping or morphism œÉ is the Segre embedding. Counting dimensions, it shows how the product of projective spaces of dimensions m and n embeds in dimension :(m + 1)(n + 1) - 1 = mn + m + n.\\\\ Classical terminology calls the coordinates on the product multihomogeneous, and the product generalised to k factors k-way projective space. Properties The Segre variety is an example of a determinantal variety; it is the zero locus of the 2√ó2 minors of the matrix (Z_{i,j}). That is, the Segre variety is the common zero locus of the quadratic polynomials :Z_{i,j} Z_{k,l} - Z_{i,l} Z_{k,j}.\\\\ Here, Z_{i,j} is understood to be the natural coordinate on the image of the Segre map. The Segre variety \\\\Sigma_{n,m} is the categorical product of P^n\\\\ and P^m. The projection :\\\\pi_X :\\\\Sigma_{n,m} \\\\to P^n\\\\ to the first factor can be specified by m+1 maps on open subsets covering the Segre variety, which agree on intersections of the subsets. For fixed j_0, the map is given by sending [Z_{i,j}] to [Z_{i,j_0}]. The equations Z_{i,j} Z_{k,l} = Z_{i,l} Z_{k,j}\\\\ ensure that these maps agree with each other, because if Z_{i_0,j_0} eq 0 we have [Z_{i,j_1}]=[Z_{i_0,j_0}Z_{i,j_1}]=[Z_{i_0,j_1}Z_{i,j_0}]=[Z_{i,j_0}]. The fibers of the product are linear subspaces. That is, let :\\\\pi_X :\\\\Sigma_{n,m} \\\\to P^n\\\\ be the projection to the first factor; and likewise \\\\pi_Y for the second factor. Then the image of the map :\\\\sigma (\\\\pi_X (\\\\cdot), \\\\pi_Y (p)):\\\\Sigma_{n,m} \\\\to P^{(n+1)(m+1)-1}\\\\ for a fixed point p is a linear subspace of the codomain. ExamplesQuadric= For example with m = n = 1 we get an embedding of the product of the projective line with itself in P3. The image is a quadric, and is easily seen to contain two one-parameter families of lines. Over the complex numbers this is a quite general non- singular quadric. Letting :[Z_0:Z_1:Z_2:Z_3]\\\\ be the homogeneous coordinates on P3, this quadric is given as the zero locus of the quadratic polynomial given by the determinant :\\\\det \\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix}Z_0&Z;_1Z_2&Z;_3\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right) = Z_0Z_3 - Z_1Z_2.\\\\ =Segre threefold= The map :\\\\sigma: P^2 \\\\times P^1 \\\\to P^5 is known as the Segre threefold. It is an example of a rational normal scroll. The intersection of the Segre threefold and a three-plane P^3 is a twisted cubic curve. =Veronese variety= The image of the diagonal \\\\Delta \\\\subset P^n \\\\times P^n under the Segre map is the Veronese variety of degree two : u_2:P^n \\\\to P^{n^2+2n}.\\\\ Applications Because the Segre map is to the categorical product of projective spaces, it is a natural mapping for describing non-entangled states in quantum mechanics and quantum information theory. More precisely, the Segre map describes how to take products of projective Hilbert spaces. In algebraic statistics, Segre varieties correspond to independence models. The Segre embedding of P2√óP2 in P8 is the only Severi variety of dimension 4.

In algebraic geometry, a closed immersion of schemes is a morphism of schemes f: Z \\\\to X that identifies Z as a closed subset of X such that locally, regular functions on Z can be extended to X.Mumford, The Red Book of Varieties and Schemes, Section II.5 The latter condition can be formalized by saying that f^\\\\\\\\#:\\\\mathcal{O}_X\\\\rightarrow f_\\\\ast\\\\mathcal{O}_Z is surjective.

The population in 2007 was approximately 75 with 33 houses. It is in the civil parish of Wrestlingworth and Cockayne Hatley. Geography Cockayne Hatley lies just over north of Wrestlingworth, east of Potton, north-east of Biggleswade and south-west of Cambridge. Landscape Natural England has designated the area as part of The Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Claylands (NCA 88). Central Bedfordshire Council has classified the landscape as Cockayne Hatley Clay Farmland (1C). Characteristics are gentle rolling slopes rising to the low plateau of Cockayne Hatley Wood, from which there are panoramic views to the south-east of large geometric fields bounded by hedgerows. Elevation The village centre is above sea level. The land rises to in Cockayne Hatley Wood. Geology and soil type The village lies on boulder clay over gault. The surrounding farmland of 587 hectares belongs to a Danish family and is contract farmed by W.J. Kendall & Sons of Eyeworth, run by Peter Kendall, the former president of the National Farmers' Union, and his brother Richard. The lime-rich loamy and clayey soil is highly fertile but with slightly impeded drainage. The chief crops are wheat, oil seed rape, beans and peas. HistoryCockayne Hatley Hall= Cockayne Hatley Hall, once known as Cockayne Hatley Mansion, was originally established by Sir John Cockayne in the 15th century. The Hall has been added to and rebuilt many times. The main parts of the present building are early Victorian with the East wing dating back to the reign of George I. There is still a single wall and fireplace dating back to Tudor times. The Cockayne family continued to reside at the Hall until the late 1860s. From 1894 to 1897 the Hall was rented by part of the \\"Old Family Line\\", the Duke of Rutland. His daughter, Lady Diana Manners, lived there as a young girl before going on to earn the widespread reputation as the most beautiful young woman in England, and appeared in countless profiles, photographs and articles in newspapers and magazines including the front page of Time magazine in February 1926. In 1929 Mr John Whitehead purchased the estate and established the largest apple orchard in England with over one million Cox's Orange Pippin trees. They were dug up and burned as uneconomic in 1974. A fire destroyed much of the south facing building in 1931. Although repaired, many of the grand rooms and architecture were lost. Mr Whitehead left the Hall shortly after the war selling the whole estate to the Co-op Farming group. Much of the property subsequently fell into disrepair before the Hall, together with some of the surrounding land, was sold back to private ownership. Now greatly restored, the Hall and the adjacent Church of John the Baptist reflect the affluence of its history. =Crinkle crankle wall= Forming a boundary of the Hall with Home Farm is a grade II listed, late 18th century crinkle crankle wall; the only known example in Bedfordshire. The high and long angular wall consists of ten zigzags of red brick laid in Flemish bond, with plain brick coping. Governance In 1985 the civil parishes of Cockayne Hatley and Wrestlingworth were merged to form Wrestlingworth and Cockayne Hatley Civil Parish. The Parish Council has seven elected members and meets bi-monthly at the Memorial Hall, Wrestlingworth. Cockayne Hatley is part of Potton ward for elections to the Central Bedfordshire Unitary Authority. Prior to 1894, Cockayne Hatley was administered as part of the Hundred of Biggleswade. From 1894 until 1974 the village was in Biggleswade Rural District and from 1974 to 2009 in Mid Bedfordshire District. Public transport No buses serve the village. The nearest railway stations are Biggleswade and Sandy. St John's Church St John's Church ca. 2000 The Church of St John the Baptist is situated at the gates of an ancient hall and dates to the thirteenth century. It contains numerous high quality works of carved wood and stained glass, mostly from the abbey of Alne near Charleroi. Dating from 1689, these works were \\"liberated\\" from Flanders following the Napoleonic wars by the Rev. Henry Cockayne Cust, parish rector from 1806 to 1861. The entry for Cockayne Hatley in the 1839 edition of Pigot's Directory Of Bedfordshire states: \\"the painted windows, the oaken screens and the stalls . . . impart to this incomparable country church the similitude to a cathedral in miniature\\". The churchyard contains a handsome monument over the grave of the poet W. E. Henley, who was a frequent visitor to Cockayne Hatley Hall. Henley, who had a wooden leg, was Robert Louis Stevenson's model for Long John Silver. Henley was also a friend of J. M. Barrie, the author of Peter Pan. Henley used to address Barrie as \\"friend\\", which Henley's only daughter, Margaret (1888‚Äì1894), who is also buried there along with her parents, mispronounced as \\"fwend\\" and changed in a childish way to \\"fwendy-wendy\\". The latter part of this familiar name gave the name of \\"Wendy Darling\\" which later became the Wendy of Peter Pan. Henley is now chiefly remembered as the author of the poem \\"Invictus\\".

The creek passes through some of the more scenic areas in Greater Austin, surrounded in many parts by a greenbelt of protected lands that serves as a habitat for many indigenous species of flora and fauna. The creek passes through Barton Creek Greenbelt and is fed by Barton Springs. Course The creek begins in northern Hays County and flows east through Austin, draining into the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone in southwest Austin. The stream then reemerges at Barton Springs and proceeds toward Lady Bird Lake (formerly Town Lake), where it joins with the Colorado River. History During the 17th and 18th centuries, Barton Creek is believed to have hosted Tonkawa and Comanche Indian camps. The creek is named after William Barton, who built a house near Barton Springs in 1837. As Austin grew the springs became a popular resort, and the natural swimming hole was replaced with a pool some time during the 1930s. =Water quality conservation= Development in Austin in the 1970s and 1980s began to threaten both the creek's water quality and wildlife. Heavy rainfall often led to contamination of the stream due to runoff and sewer line seepage from the upstream subdivisions entering the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone. Following public outcry, the Austin City Council passed the Barton Creek watershed ordinance in 1980 and the Comprehensive Watersheds Ordinance in 1986. Proposals in 1990 to develop land in the watershed resulted in more public outcry, which spurred passage of the Save Our Springs Citizens' Initiative of 1992, which severely limited construction, curtailed tax exemptions, established pollution control standards and implemented methods for reducing accidental contamination. =Ecological conservation= The middle part of the creek runs through Barton Creek Greenbelt, a public recreation space of protected land surrounding the creek. In 1994 The Nature Conservancy purchased land surrounding the upper creek to establish the Barton Creek Habitat Preserve, a habitat maintained in cooperation with local residents. The reserve is home to old-growth stands of juniper, oak, cedar and elm trees, rare woodland flowers and plants such as Heller's marbleseed and gravelbar brickellbush, endangered golden-cheeked warblers and black-capped vireos, and the threatened Guadalupe bass. Recreation During rainy seasons, upper Barton Creek hosts water recreation including kayaking, tubing, and swimming. The Lower Barton Creek Greenbelt features these water sports year-round with swimming in Barton Springs Pool, and kayaking and canoeing in the creek fed with the discharge from the springs.

United States, 219 U.S. 346 (1911),. was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court delineated the authority of United States federal courts to hear certain kinds of cases under the Case or Controversy Clause of the United States Constitution. Facts In this case, Congress passed a statute permitting certain Native Americans to bring suits against the United States to determine the constitutionality of a law allocating tribal lands, and providing that Counsel for both sides were to be paid from the United States Treasury. Several cases were brought pursuant to this statute, including suits brought by David Muskrat and J. Henry Dick opposing the partition of Indian lands, and by another pair, William Brown and Levi B. Gritts, opposing a prohibition against the sale of certain Indian lands. Result The United States Supreme Court refused to allow the case to be heard, maintaining that, though the United States was named as a defendant, the case in question was not an actual controversy: rather, the statute was merely devised to test the constitutionality of a certain type of legislation, and the Court's ruling would be nothing more than an advisory opinion; therefore, it dismissed the suit for failing to present a \\"case or controversy\\", as required by Article III of the United States Constitution. Later developments Although this decision remains as valid case law, its effective precedent has been diminished by the Supreme Court's approval of the declaratory judgment act, which permits a party to seek a declaration of rights against another party, even where no affirmative relief (e.g. damages or an injunction) is being sought. In a declaratory judgment action, if under the facts as proved, there is some possibility of a future need for relief as among the parties, a declaratory judgment may be entered.

Harrow Borough's home ground is Earlsmead Stadium, which has a capacity of 3,070. Harrow Borough moved into Earlsmead Stadium in 1934 and have kept it as their home stadium since then. Harrow Borough's colour is red, which is the colour of their home kit. Their crest depicts the coat of arms of the London Borough of Harrow. Harrow Borough have rejected the chance to join the Football Conference, now known as the National League, twice due to financial reasons. Harrow have won the Isthmian League Premier Division once, in 1983-84. They have won the Middlesex Senior Cup, Middlesex Charity Cup, Harrow Senior Cup and George Ruffell Memorial Shield. Their most recent cup achievements have been winning the Middlesex Senior Cup and Middlesex Charity Cup, both in 2015 and reaching the first round of the FA Cup in 2016-17, for the fourth time in their history, when they lost to Northampton Town. Their most recent league achievement has been reaching the Isthmian League Premier Division Playoffs in 2010-11. HistoryEarly history ‚Äì Roxonian F.C. to Harrow Town F.C.= The club was originally formed in 1933 under the name Roxonian F.C. and played their first season in the Harrow and District League finishing runners up. The next season saw the club move into a new ground, Earlsmead Stadium, and a new league. They started in the Spartan League Division Two West and in 1938 they would finish second. As only the Champions were promoted they would have to wait till the following season when they finished top under their new name of Harrow Town F.C. to progress. The eruption of war in the 1940s saw Harrow Town's ascent cut short, relegating the team to Middlesex Leagues until the war finished. The war years saw Harrow Town compete in the West Middlesex Combination and then the Middlesex Senior League. After the end of the war, the club finally made its rightful position at the top level of the Spartan League. They remained in the Spartan League until finishing runners up in 1958 and being promoted to the Delphian League. =1960s and 1970s= When the Delphian League disbanded in 1964 Harrow Town were accepted into the Athenian League, where they were promoted to Division One at the first attempt having finished runners up and only missing out on the top spot on goal difference. In the 1960s the club began to run into financial trouble. Coming close to liquidation, Harrow Town was forced to sell their second pitch at Earlsmead to the council to try and survive. Earlsemead Primary School was later built on this land. Now reduced to one pitch, the club, renamed to Harrow Borough F.C. and gaining them the nickname ‚ÄòBoro‚Äô, managed to make some gains and got elected to the Isthmian League in Division Two in 1975. In 1979 they were promoted, having finished second, to what was now called the Premier Division where they have played ever since. Harrow Borough redeveloped their ground after selling the second pitch. =1979‚Äì2004 ‚Äì Success and stability= Their first few seasons in the Premier Division saw steady progress. In 1982‚Äì83 the club finished third in the league and won the Middlesex Senior Cup. Harrow also had its furthest ever run in the FA Trophy reaching the semi finals only to lose in the second leg to the eventual winners Telford United. In 1983‚Äì84, the club's most successful season to date, they won the Isthmian League championship by seventeen points. The same year saw Harrow have its greatest ever FA Cup run, reaching the 2nd round proper before being knocked out by Newport County, who were then in Division Three (now League One). During this period the importance place on ensuring the long term security of the club led to them turning down the financially risky promotion to the Football Conference twice. 1985 saw manager Micky Tomkys retire and a steady decline in the club's fortunes followed, having finished fifth and sixth in the following seasons. After Boro's decline in the late 1980s, a new manager, Harry Manoe, was appointed and Harrow saw a resurgence. In 1993 they did a double, winning both the Middlesex Senior and Charity Cup beating Chelsea 4‚Äì1 in the semi finals of the latter. The early nineties also saw an improvement in league form after several disappointing seasons previously. Since the turn of the century, the club have failed to match earlier league successes and have gone on a slow decline, finding themselves often drawn into relegation battles. In 2000 they avoided relegation by only a single goal on goal difference, earning them the nickname \\"Houdini Boro\\". In 2003 David Howell was appointed as the new manager and the performances improved immediately; in 2004 Boro lost on penalties in a play-off which would have seen them join the Conference South, the sixth tier of English football. =2005‚Äì2010 ‚Äì Cup finals and success= Having missed out in the finals of the Middlesex Senior Cup in 2001, Harrow would finally bring home silverware in the form of the Middlesex Charity Cup in 2006, beating Enfield 2‚Äì0 in the final. Harrow retained this cup in 2007 beating Brook House in the final on penalties. Having won the competition in 2006 and 2007, Boro were entered in the Middlesex Super Cup, a cup which faces off the winners of the Middlesex Senior Charity Cup and the Middlesex Senior Cup. It is formally known as the George Ruffell Memorial Shield. Boro lost 2‚Äì0 in 2006 to Hampton & Richmond but won the cup the following year in 2007 beating Northwood 3‚Äì0. In the 2008‚Äì09 season, Boro managed to reach the final of the Isthmian League Cup. Boro beat Hendon, Godalming Town, Harlow, Horsham and Ashford Town (Middx) to reach the final before losing to Isthmian League Division One side Tilbury. The 2009‚Äì10 season saw the introduction of the Harrow Borough youth team, playing their football in the Isthmian Youth League West Division. Their first season youth football led them to finishing in 6th place. =2010‚Äì11 ‚Äì League improvement= Harrow Borough finished the 2009‚Äì10 season in 14th place in the Isthmian League Premier Division. In the summer and pre-season following, Borough managed to reduce debts. After starting the season slowly, the 2010‚Äì11 season saw the club qualify for the first round of the FA Cup for only the third time in their history. Borough bowed out to eventual League Two champions Chesterfield 2‚Äì0 at Earlsmead. After being knocked out of the FA Cup in November, Harrow Borough sparked an unbeaten run into January before losing to Folkestone Invicta. Following this, Borough sold young striker Troy Hewitt to Queens Park Rangers. Borough managed to end the 2010‚Äì11 season strongly despite losing Troy Hewitt and finished on a good run of form. A 1‚Äì1 draw on the final day of the season against Cray Wanderers was enough to secure a play-off spot away to Tonbridge Angels. Harrow Borough lost 3‚Äì2 after extra time in the semi-finals to Tonbridge. After going 2‚Äì0 down early on, veteran striker Rocky Baptiste scored two goals to force extra time, but Tonbridge scored a late winner. In June 2011, long serving manager David Howell left Borough, along with assistant Ken Charlery, to join St Albans City. =2011‚Äì12 ‚Äì New manager= In June 2011, David Howells successor was announced. Dave Anderson was chosen as the man to lead Boro into the 2011‚Äì12 season and help to continue with the clubs non league plan. He led Boro to safety in his first season, with the club finishing 17th in the Isthmian Premier Division. A massive 53 different players were used in the first team as Dave Anderson had to rebuild a squad from scratch. The club could not match the exploits in the FA Cup from the previous season, going out in the 2nd Qualifying Round to Dartford. Boro went out in the 2nd Qualifying Round of the FA Trophy, to AFC Hornchurch in a replay. Boro also lost out in the league cup, losing to Cheshunt at home in the 3rd round, Middlesex Senior Cup losing to North Greenford United in the 2nd round and London Senior cup, losing to Hendon in the quarter finals. Anderson stepped down in January 2015 following three-and-a-half years in the job, citing the poor run of form as the reason for leaving. =2015‚Äì2017 A change in management, survival, double cup success and reprieve= With Harrow struggling in the relegation zone, Anderson resigned in January 2015. After 30 applications for the job, a shortlist of 8 was drawn up by the board. On 25 January 2015, Harrow confirmed the appointment of Steve Baker as the club's new manager, arriving from Isthmian League Division One South side Chipstead having beaten off competition from Kevin Gallen and Rufus Brevett for the job. Despite taking the job with the club deep in relegation trouble, a tremendous run of form saw Baker steer Harrow Borough to safety as the club ended the 2014/15 season in 16th place, as well as progressing to two cup finals in both Middlesex competitions ‚Äì the Middlesex Senior Cup and Middlesex Charity Cup. Baker steered the club to victory in the Middlesex Senior Cup final, with a 1‚Äì0 win over Hanwell Town on 9 May 2015 and then led Harrow to victory in the Middlesex Charity Cup final on 1 August 2015 with a 3‚Äì0 win over Cockfosters to complete the 'Middlesex double'. Success in the Charity Cup final was Harrow's first since 2007 and their fifth all time. The 2016-17 season started positively with Harrow Borough reaching the first round proper of the FA Cup for the first time in five years. Harrow faced English Football League side Northampton Town away and lost the tie 6-0. Harrow's form in the league dropped as well and in May 2017, Boro's long stay in the Premier Division was set to come to an end when Harrow lost 2-0 to Lowestoft Town on the final day of the 2016-17 season and saw them finish in the relegation zone. A few weeks, however, after the end of the season, following alterations higher up the pyramid involving promotions and relegations, Harrow were offered a reprieve and the relegation was reversed, which saw the club remain in the Premier Division for the 2017-18 season. Ground Harrow Borough play their home games at Earlsmead Stadium. It has been home to Harrow Borough since 1934, a year after their formation. It is located in South Harrow. The stadium used to be known as Dabbs Field. This is believed to have been the site of a medieval battle. The stadium has a capacity of 3,070 with 350 seats and covering for 1,000 people. The record attendance of 3000 was set in 1946, for an FA Cup match against local rivals Wealdstone FC. The stadium's address is: Carlyon Avenue, South Harrow, HA2 8SS. Club crest Club badge In 1933, the club bore the coat of arms of the London Borough of Harrow. The shield represents various parts of Harrow. The green, horizontal bar represents the presence of the green belt in the town. A flaming torch can also be found on the shield, symbolising knowledge for Harrow School. A quill pen refers to Pinner and the famous authors who have lived there and finally, a small cluster of trees reflect Harrow Weald and the mound on Harrow-on-the-Hill. The motto reads as \\"Salus Populi Suprema Lex\\" which translates from Latin as \\"The well-being of the people is the highest law\\". Harrow Borough wear a slightly modified version of this badge on their playing kit, using a simple red and white colour scheme but the same pictures and symbols can be found as in the logo. Rivalries Harrow Borough's two main rivals are Wembley and Wealdstone, although neither of these two teams currently play in the same league as Harrow Borough. Wealdstone are considered to be Harrow Borough's main, long-standing rivals due to the geographical proximity between the two clubs. However, Wealdstone have regularly played at a higher level and league fixtures between the teams have been rare, historically. Wembley has also been a local rival but the rivalry has somewhat diminished as Wembley's fall down the leagues means there are currently very few fixtures between the two clubs.

Founded by Abraham Ferwerda, it first appeared in 1752. The Leeuwarder Courant was the first paper in the Dutch province Friesland and its capital Leeuwarden. It is considered a \\"popular\\" (as opposed to \\"quality\\") newspaper.Hugo Verdaasdonk, \\"Quotations expressing the valuative stands of literary reviewers,\\" in P. 393 n. 1. History and profile Abraham Ferwerda was a printer and publisher in Leeuwarden, who first published the Leeuwarder Courant on 29 July 1752, and reportedly made a fortune publishing his paper. From the beginning, the intention was to produce a politically neutral paper which would gain revenue from objectively reporting news; until well into the nineteenth century the paper maintained its rather bland image. A conscious choice was also to focus on mercantile and international news, rather than report on too many local issues which might cause controversy with the local and national governments. In fact, during the latter part of the eighteenth century (the period which saw the decline of the Dutch Republic) the paper was criticized for its lack of patriotism. For a long time it was the only medium for advertisements in the region, which helped ensure its commercial success, and until 1842 it was the only serious newspaper in Friesland. After Ferwerda's death, his son-in-law, Doeke Ritske Smeding, took over and guided the paper though the French occupation of the early nineteenth century (during which many Dutch papers were shut down by the occupier). Smeding died in 1814; Pieter Koumans Smeding, his cousin, ran the paper until 1854. His heirs owned the newspaper until 1947. In 2013 Leeuwarder Courant was awarded the European Newspaper of the Year in the category of regional newspapers. Contents While initially publishing mainly business and international news, in the nineteenth century the paper improved in quality and layout, and began publishing more news and stories related to Friesland. Important in this respect was the column \\"Mengelwerk,\\" a kind of Frisian miscellany, which was published every Tuesday starting February 2, 1830, and included anecdotes and stories, and usually Frisian matters. Most of these anecdotes were written in Dutch, though the occasional West Frisian entry was printed. In the early to mid nineteenth century, the Leeuwarder Courant began to publish literary reviews. Jacob van Leeuwen (1787-1857) and Wopke Eekhoff (1809-1880) wrote most of the reviews, in most cases without a byline, and in one case Eekhoff recommended a poetry collection he had written himself. The literary criticism in the Leeuwarder Courant is especially significant since its readership was to be found in the upper circles of Frisian society‚Äîthe bookbuying public, the notables who were greatly interested in matters of language, literature, and culture, and helped determine their society's tastes and predilections. Additionally, it is the only source of theoretical observations about contemporary Frisian literature. From 1830 to 1848, for instance, it published 140 literary reviews, most by Frisian authors, and 46 articles on literary topics, sixteen of which on Frisian authors (twelve out of those sixteen on authors who wrote before 1800): the literary reviews and articles provide valuable insight in West Frisian (and Dutch) literature and contemporary attitudes toward the literary past.http://www.omniglot.com/writing/frisian.htm Only some of the content of \\"Mengelwerk\\" was in West Frisian, and today still the paper publishes mostly articles written in Dutch; it was estimated that only around 5% of its content (and that of its main competitor, the Friesch Dagblad) is in West Frisian.Jehannes Ytsma, \\"Language Use and Language Attitudes in Friesland,\\" in ReferencesBibliographyStudies of the paper= * * =200th anniversary publication= * External links * Leeuwarder Courant, The Category:Publications established in 1752 Category:Mass media in Leeuwarden ","title":"Leeuwarder Courant"},{"id":"1624032","text":"Attic black-figure krater-psykter (525‚Äì500 BCE, Louvre Museum) In Greek mythologyKarl Kerenyi, Dionysos: Archetypal image of indestructible life 1976:123, observes that \\"the ecstatic band of bacchantes and agitated male nature gods in a state of heightened zo√´ ... is not reflected in Minoan art.\\" and religion, the thiasus (), was the ecstatic retinue of Dionysus, often pictured as inebriated revelers. Many of the myths of Dionysus are connected with his arrival in the form of a procession. The grandest such version was his triumphant return from \\"India\\", which influenced symbolic conceptions of the Roman triumph and was narrated in rapturous detail in Nonnus' Dionysiaca. In this procession, Dionysus rides a chariot, often drawn by big cats such as tigers, leopards, or lions. The thiasos of the sea god Poseidon is depicted as a triumphal wedding procession with Amphitrite, attended by figures such as sea nymphs and hippocamps. In historical Greek society, thiasoi (plural; ) were religious organizations whose existence was protected by law.For example the thiasos in Athens examined by Marcus N. Tod, \\"A Statute of an Attic Thiasos\\", The Annual of the British School at Athens 13 (1906/07):328-338). Dionysian thiasos The most significant members of the thiasus were the human female devotees, the maenads, who gradually replaced immortal nymphs. In Greek vase-paintings or bas-reliefs, lone female figures can be recognized as belonging to the thiasus by their brandishing the thyrsos, the distinctive staff or rod of the devotee. Triumph of Dionysus on a fragmentary Roman mosaic (3rd century, Sousse Archaeological Museum) Other regulars of the retinue were various nature spirits, including the sileni (or human dancers costumed as such), phalluses much in evidence, satyrs, and Pan. The ithyphallic sileni are often shown dancing on vase paintings.Karl Kerenyi (Dionysos: Archetypal image of indestructible life 1976), selects as an example a 6th-century vase, figs 39/A and B. The tutor of Dionysus is represented by a single aged Silenus. The retinue is sometimes shown being brought before a seated recipient: the tragic human welcomer of the gift of wine, Ikarios or Semachos, and his daughter, Erigone.See Kerenyi 1976, ch. iv. \\"The Myths of Arrival\\". In the triumphal form of procession, Ariadne sometimes rides with Dionysus as his consort. Heracles followed the thiasus for a short while following his loss of a drinking contest to Dionysus. On the 6th-century BC Fran√ßois Vase, Dionysus is accompanied in procession by the three Horae.Detail illustrated in Kerenyi 1976 fig. 37. Other notable depictions in art include the silver \\"Great Dish\\" from the Mildenhall Treasure, the Lycurgus Cup, and in the Renaissance Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne. The Dionysian retinue was a popular subject for Roman art, especially bas-reliefs and sarcophagus panels.  Marine thiasos  Sea thiasos depicting the wedding of Poseidon and Amphitrite, from the Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus in the Field of Mars, bas-relief, Roman Republic, 2nd century BC A marine thiasos (or sea thiasos) is a term for a group like the Dionysian thiasos, except with the chief god replaced by Poseidon or some other sea deity. Lattimore while insisting that the chief god must be Poseidon in a strict sense, includes examples where Poseidon is completely absent in the composition, which most frequently figure Tritons and Nereids as marine retinues. An original work of Skopas on this theme was taken to Rome and described by Pliny but is now lost. Still, the theme is well represented in surviving works of Roman art, from tiny decorative reliefs and large sarcophagus panels to extensive mosaics. Even in the Skopas example, the main theme was the deliverance of the slain Achilles to Elysium, attended by his mother Thetis (though Poseidon is present as well), and examples of Thetis's retinue have been described as marine thiasos. The marine thiasos could otherwise be the retinue for Oceanus, or to Venus Marina.

It was first published in October 1997. Unlike the previous four stories, Family Values was released as a 128-page graphic novel rather than in serialized issues that would later be collected in a trade paperback volume. Plot Dwight McCarthy is on a mission from Gail to dig up information about a recent mob hit at a small diner. After being hit on by a female cop, (who he manages to get rid of by pretending to be a bisexual masochist), he goes into a bar near where the hit happened and tries to charm one of the local drinkers there named Peggy. Dwight also spots Fat Man and Little Boy, which makes his job easier later on. As Dwight keeps charming Peggy, she realizes he's not interested in any company that night and only looking for information behind the recent hit. She reveals that Bruno, the target, was killed by Vito, one of Don Magliozzi's nephews and hitmen. Don Magliozzi ordered the hit on Bruno, who murdered his beloved niece years before. This went against his family's treaty with mob boss Wallenquist, who had Bruno on his payroll. Ever since then, the entire city has lived in fear of a mob war. With that information, Dwight leaves the bar, to be confronted by Vito and some other Magliozzi hitmen, alerted by Fat Man and Little Boy. The thugs kidnap Dwight, but he is more interested in Vito's car, swearing that it will be his once he kills all of them. Uninterested, Vito brags about killing every living thing at the diner, including a stray dog. Dwight then tells Miho, who has been following them, to strike; she kills Spinelli and one of the goons. They park in a hilltop rest area, overlooking the Projects. There, Miho toys with one of the hitmen as Dwight tells Vito to kill the other hitman; Vito's own brother Luca. After Miho and Dwight are through, they head straight to Sacred Oaks to confront Don Magliozzi. As Miho massacres the guards, Dwight tells the Don he is going to die along with Vito, and reveals why: the accidental death of Carmen, one of the Old Town girls. Dwight tells them Vito shouldn't have shot at the stray dog, since the angles were in a straight line to a nearby phone booth where Carmen was calling for a ride. Carmen was killed by the gunfire. Carmen's lover, Daisy, arrives as Dwight walks away from the Don and his associates, and guns them down. Dwight remarks that the massacre will result in a mob war, but that neither he nor the girls of Old Town will have cause to worry about it. Finally, he takes possession of Vito's car and drives off into the night. Characters *Dwight McCarthy, a criminal who takes it upon himself to take on the Magliozzi clan to avenge Carmen's death.

Brunet was born in Quebec City on 10 March 1826, the son of Jean-Olivier Brunet, a merchant, and C√©cile Lagueux. From 1844, he was educated at the S√©minaire de Qu√©bec, and was ordained on 10 October 1848. He was for the next ten years employed variously as a missionary, a curate, and parish priest. Upon the departure of his former mentor, the Abb√© Edward John Horan, he was in 1858 appointed teacher of science at his alma mater, which had become Universit√© Laval in 1852 following a grant of a Royal Charter by Queen Victoria. Following the resignation of mineralogist Thomas Sterry Hunt, Brunet succeeded him as the Chair of Natural History. His expertise as a botanist developed following field work in Ontario and Quebec, as well as two years spent in visiting European herbaria and a course of lectures at the Sorbonne, the Jardin des Plantes, and the Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris, France. He corresponded with noted American botanist Asa Gray who encouraged him to undertake a survey of Canadian flora. This work, commenced in 1860 and encompassing more than 582 pages, was never published, partly as the result of its anticipation in 1862 upon the publication of Flore canadienne by his competitor L√©on Provancher.

Easter Vigil, also called the Paschal Vigil or the Great Vigil of Easter, is a liturgy held in traditional Christian churches as the first official celebration of the Resurrection of Jesus. Historically, it is during this liturgy that people are baptized and that adult catechumens are received into full communion with the Church. It is held in the hours of darkness between sunset on Holy Saturday and sunrise on Easter Day ‚Äì most commonly in the evening of Holy Saturday or midnight ‚Äì and is the first celebration of Easter, days traditionally being considered to begin at sunset. Among liturgical western churches including the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, and Lutheran churches, the Easter Vigil is the most important liturgy of public worship and Masses of the liturgical year, marked by the first use since the beginning of Lent of the exclamatory \\"Alleluia\\", a distinctive feature of the Easter season. In Eastern Orthodox churches, Oriental Orthodox churches, and other traditions of Eastern Christianity, the extremely festive ceremonies and Divine Liturgy which are celebrated during the Easter Vigil are unique to that night and are the most elaborate and important of the liturgical year. Earliest known form of the Easter Vigil The original twelve Old Testament readings for the Easter Vigil survive in an ancient manuscript belonging to the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The Armenian Easter Vigil also preserves what is believed to be the original length of the traditional gospel reading of the Easter Vigil, i.e., from the Last Supper account to the end of the Gospel according to Matthew In the earliest Jerusalem usage the vigil began with Psalm 117 [118] sung with the response, \\"This is the day which the Lord has made.\\" Then followed twelve Old Testament readings, all but the last being followed by a prayer with kneeling. > (1) Genesis 1:1--3:24 (the story of creation); (2) Genesis 22:1-18 (the > binding of Isaac); (3) Exodus 12:1-24 (the Passover charter narrative); (4) > Jonah 1:1--4:11 (the story of Jonah); (5) Exodus 14:24--15:21 (crossing of > the Red Sea); (6) Isaiah 60:1-13 (the promise to Jerusalem); (7) Job 38:2-28 > (the Lord's answer to Job); (8) 2 Kings 2:1-22 (the assumption of Elijah); > (9) Jeremiah 31:31-34 (the New Covenant); (10) Joshua 1:1-9 (entry into the > Promised Land); (11) Ezekiel 37:1-14 (the valley of dry bones); (12) Daniel > 3:1-29 (the story of the three youths). The twelfth reading leads into the Song of the Three Children and is not followed by a prayer with kneeling, but is immediately followed by the prokeimenon of the Eucharistic liturgy. Thomas Talley stresses the importance of this series of reading as representing the oldest known series and the one evidently having the very greatest influence on the development of all subsequent series of readings.Thomas J. Talley, The Origins of the Liturgical Year, New York: Pueblo Publishing Company, Inc., 1986, pp.48-49. According to Byzantine historian Andrew Ekonomou, the Easter Vespers was unknown in Rome prior to its introduction in the mid-7th century, and solemnization by Pope Vitalian during the period when Rome was part of the Byzantine Empire. The Paschal vespers was long celebrated in Constantinople prior to this and the liturgy itself has details that appear eastern in origin.Andrew J. Ekonomou. Byzantine Rome and the Greek Popes. Lexington books, 2007. Western churchesCatholic Church= Lighting of a paschal candle in Mexico City. The Roman Missal states: \\"Of this night‚Äôs Vigil, which is the greatest and most noble of all solemnities, there is to be only one celebration in each church. It is arranged, moreover, in such a way that after the Lucernarium and the \\"Exsultet\\", The Easter Proclamation (which constitutes the first part of this Vigil), Holy Church meditates on the wonders the Lord God has done for his people from the beginning, trusting in his word and promise (the second part, that is, the Liturgy of the Word) until, as day approaches, with new members reborn in Baptism (the third part), the Church is called to the table the Lord has prepared for his people, the memorial of his Death and Resurrection until he comes again (the fourth part).\\"Roman Missal, The Easter Vigil in the Holy Night, 2 In the Roman Rite liturgy, the Easter Vigil consists of four parts: #The Service of Light #The Liturgy of the Word #Christian Initiation and the Renewal of Baptismal Vows #Eucharist The vigil begins between sunset on Holy Saturday and sunrise on Easter Sunday outside the church, where an Easter fire is kindled and the Paschal candle is blessed and then lit. This Paschal candle will be used throughout the season of Easter, remaining in the sanctuary of the church or near the lectern, and throughout the coming year at baptisms and funerals, reminding all that Christ is \\"light and life\\". Once the candle has been lit, it is carried by a deacon through the nave of the church, itself in complete darkness, stopping three times to chant the acclamation 'Light of Christ' (Lumen Christi), to which the assembly responds 'Thanks be to God' or 'Deo Gratias'. As the candle proceeds through the church, the small candles held by those present are gradually lit from the Paschal candle. As this symbolic \\"Light of Christ\\" spreads, darkness is decreased. The deacon, priest, or a cantor now chants the Exsultet (also called the \\"Easter Proclamation\\" or \\"Paschal Praeconium\\"), after which the people sit for the Liturgy of the Word. Once the paschal candle has been placed on its stand in the sanctuary, the lights in the church are switched on and the congregation extinguish their candles (although in some churches, the custom is to continue the liturgy by candlelight or without any lights until the Gloria). The Liturgy of the Word consists of seven readings from the Old Testament (i.e., 1. Genesis 1:1-2:2; 2. Genesis 22:1-18; 3. Exodus 14:15-15:1; 4. Isaiah 54:4a.5-14; 5. Isaiah 55:1-11; 6. Baruch 3:9-15.32-4:4; 7. Ezekiel 36:16-17a, 18-28),Thomas Talley claims that the original readings of the Roman paschal vigil were Genesis 1, Genesis 22, Exodus 14, Deuteronomy 31, Isaiah 4, Isaiah 54 and Baruch 3. although it is permitted to reduce this number for pastoral reasons to at least three, or for very pressing pastoral reasons two. The account of the Israelites' crossing of the Red Sea may never be omitted, since this event is at the centre of the Jewish Passover, of which Christians believe Christ's death and resurrection is the fulfillment. Each reading is followed by a psalm or biblical canticle (i.e., Psalm 10, Exodus 15:1-18, Psalm 30, Isaiah 12:2-6, Psalm 19, Psalm 42 & 43) sung responsorially and by a prayer that relates what has been read in the Old Testament to the mystery of Christ. After these readings conclude, the altar candles are lit and the Gloria in Excelsis Deo is sung for the first time since before Lent (with the exception of Holy Thursday, as well as any solemnities or feasts that occurred during Lent), and the church bells and the organ, silent since that point on Holy Thursday, are sounded again - although it is customary in some churches to have no organ playing during Lent at all, except when accompanying hymns. (In the pre-Vatican II rite, the statues, which have been covered during Passiontide, are unveiled at this time.) The collect is sung or recited. The reading from the Epistle to the Romans (Romans 6:3-11) is proclaimed, followed by the chanting of Psalm 118. The Alleluia is sung for the first time since before Lent and with special solemnity. The Gospel of the Resurrection (Matthew 28:1-10; Mark 16:1-8 or Luke 24:1-12 follows, along with a homily. After the conclusion of the Liturgy of the Word, the water of the baptismal font is solemnly blessed, and any catechumens and candidates for full communion are initiated into the church by baptism or confirmation. After the celebration of these sacraments of initiation, the congregation renews their baptismal vows and receive the sprinkling of baptismal water. The prayer of the faithful (of whom the newly baptised are now part) follow. After the prayers, the Liturgy of the Eucharist continues as usual. This is the first Mass of Easter Day. During the Eucharist, the newly baptized receive Holy Communion for the first time. According to the rubrics of the Missal, the Eucharist should finish before dawn. The 20th century saw two major revisions of the Roman-Rite Easter Vigil liturgy. The first occurred in the 1950s under Pope Pius XII. Previously, the Vigil liturgy was held on Holy Saturday morning. Outside the church the Easter fire was lit and blessed, and five grains of incense were also blessed. All lamps and candles within the church were quenched, so as to be relit later with the new fire. (The rubrics did not envisage electricity or gas lighting.) At the church entrance, in the centre of the church, and then at the altar, each of the candles on a triple candlestick was in turn lit from a candle that had been lit from the new fire, and on each occasion this was followed by a genuflection and the chanting of \\"Lumen Christi\\". During the singing of the Exsultet, which then followed, the five grains of incense were placed in the paschal candle and the paschal candle was lit from one of the candles on the triple candlestick. The Liturgy of the word consisted of twelve readings, for the most part without responsory chants: the seven mentioned above except the fourth and seventh, plus the account of the Flood (Gen 5-8) as the second; followed by a different one from Ezekiel (37:1-14), plus Isaiah 4:1-6, Exodus 12:1-11 (the introduction of the Paschal rites, also read then on Good Friday but now on Holy Thursday), Jonah 3:1-10, Deuteronomy 31:22-30, Daniel 3:1-24. The prayers after the readings were preceded by Flectamus genua and a genuflection, except for the last. After the Old Testament readings the baptismal font was blessed, and the conferral of baptism was envisaged, though rarely performed. The Litany of the Saints followed. Violet vestments were worn except for the deacon (or the priest performing the deacon's functions) who wore a white dalmatic in the procession and at the Exsultet. The priest, unless acting as deacon, wore a violet cope. After this, white Mass vestments were put on, and Mass followed. The Mass was in the then normal form (including the prayers at the foot of the altar), but without Introit, Agnus Dei, Postcommunion and Last Gospel. Its Epistle was Colossians 3:1-4, and the Gospel Matthew 28:1-7. Mass was followed immediately by abbreviated Vespers. Pope Pius XII changed the hour of the celebration to after sunset. He separated the blessing and lighting of the Candle from the Exsultet to the beginning, the present position. The triple candlestick was no longer used. It was from the Paschal candle that, at the chanting of \\"Lumen Christi\\" (without genuflection) the priest would light his own candle at the Paschal candle; for the second, the rest of the clergy plus altar servers would, and for the third, the entire congregation. The Exsultet's function was turned (without change in the text) into a jubilant praise of the Paschal candle already blessed and lit. Of the Old Testament readings, only four were kept: what had been the first (story of Creation - now still the first), the fourth (Red Sea - now the third), the eighth (second from Isaiah) and the eleventh (Deuteronomy). Then followed the first part of the Litany of the Saints (only the names of the saints), the blessing of the font, possible baptisms, renewal of baptismal promises (a novelty with respect to the past and the first inclusion of the vernacular language in the general Roman liturgy), and the second part of the litany. After this came Mass (without prayers at the foot of the altar), followed by Easter lauds (no longer Holy Saturday Vespers). In virtue of the 2007 motu proprio Summorum Pontificum, this form may, under certain conditions, still be used because of its inclusion in the 1962 Roman Missal of Pope John XXIII. =Anglicanism= Although the Easter Vigil is not universal in the Anglican Communion, its use has become far more common in recent decades. Formerly it was only common in parishes in the Anglo-Catholic tradition, having been abandoned at the Reformation and recovered by the 19th-century Tractarian movement. The service, as provided for example in the current version of the Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America (TEC), the Book of Alternative Services of the Anglican Church of Canada and the Times and Seasons volume of the Church of England's Common Worship, follows more or less the same form as the Roman Catholic liturgy described above, with some variations in texts and ritual.Times and Seasons: The Easter Liturgy The four- part structure of the Vigil is retained, though in the TEC rite the service of baptism may follow immediately after the readings from the Old Testament. The service normally consists of four parts: #The Service of Light. #The Service of Lessons. #Christian Initiation, or the Renewal of Baptismal Vows. #The Holy Eucharist with the administration of Easter Communion. Some of the other particular differences from the Roman Catholic observance include: #If the service of baptism takes place after the Old Testament readings, the Gloria is sung after the Baptism or Renewal of Baptismal Vows. The Te Deum Laudamus or the Pascha Nostrum may be used in place of the Gloria. #The number and particular passages in the Service of Lessons differs. There are up to nine (as opposed to seven) readings from the Hebrew Bible. Confirmations occur only when the bishop is present, because, in the Anglican tradition, only a bishop may administer confirmation. =Lutheranism= Lutheran deacon with Easter candle Congregation with small Easter candles The Easter Vigil, like the Christmas Vigil, remained a popular festive worship service in the Lutheran churches during and after the Reformation. It was often celebrated in the early morning hours of Easter Sunday. As in all Lutheran services of this period, vernacular language was used in combination with traditional liturgical texts in Latin (such as the Exsultet). Elements which were considered unbiblical and superstitious were eliminated, such as the blessing of the new fire, the consecration of the candles or of water. Emphasis was placed on the scriptural readings, congregational singing and on the Easter sermon. In Wittenberg the Easter Gospel (Matthew 28. 1 - 10; 16 - 20) was sung in the German language in a tone similar to the tone of the Exsultet - a gospel tone only used for this worship service. The devastation caused by the Thirty Years' War also led to a decline in worship culture in the Lutheran Churches in Germany. The rationalism of the 18th century also brought about a change in worship habits and customs. The liturgical movement that arose in the German Lutheran Churches after World War I rediscovered the Easter Vigil in its reformational form. In an article from 1934 for the Liturgical Conference of Lower Saxony and for the Berneuchen Movement Wilhelm St√§hlin appealed to fellow Lutherans for an Easter service on early Easter Sunday or on Holy Saturday night using elements from the Missal, the Orthodox tradition and from reformational service orders. An order for the Easter Vigil was published in 1936, and several Lutheran congregations in Hannover observed the Easter Vigil in 1937. Since then the Easter Vigil has experienced a revival in many parishes throughout Germany. This movement within the German Lutheran Churches contributed to a revival and revision of the Roman Catholic order for the Easter Vigil by Pope Pius XII in 1951. The \\"Agende II\\" for the Evangelical Lutheran Churches and Parishes in Germany from 1960 gave the \\"Osternacht\\" (German for \\"Easter Vigil\\") a normative form. The most recent agenda for the Easter Vigil was published by the \\"Vereinigte Evangelisch-lutherische Kirche\\" in 2008.Mahrenholz, Christhard: Agende II f√ºr evangelisch-lutherische Kirchen und Gemeinden, Lutherisches Verlagshaus, Berlin 1960, pp. 304 - 306; Schmidt- Lauber, Hans-Christoph: Die Zukunft des Gottesdienstes, Calwer Verlag, Stuttgart, 1990, pp. 395 - 396 The order for the Easter Vigil is comparable to the order of service used by American Lutherans. It is characterized, however, by a number of Gregorian chants, medieval and reformational hymns which have been in use in German worship services for centuries. In North America the Lutherans, similarly to the Anglicans, have in many places returned to the observance of the Easter Vigil [including the restoration of the blessing of the new fire]. The recent service books of both the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America assume the service as normative. In the Lutheran Service Book, the Altar Book, the Vigil comprises the Service of Light with the Exsultet; the Service or Readings with up to 12 readings; the Service of Holy Baptism at which candidates may be baptized, the baptized confirmed, and the congregation remember its Baptism into Jesus; the Service of Prayer, featuring an Easter litany; and concluding with the Service of the Sacrament, at which the Holy Eucharist is celebrated. =Methodism= In Methodism, the Easter Vigil is the first service of Eastertide. The liturgy contained in The United Methodist Book of Worship divides the Easter Vigil into four parts: #The Service of Light #The Service of the Word #The Service of the Baptismal Covenant #The Service of the Table The Service of Light begins in silence outside of the church building in the nighttime and there, a new fire is kindled and each member of the congregation is given a candle; a greeting, opening prayer and lighting of the Paschal Candle from the new fire then solemnly occurs. The clergy and congregation receive the new light from the Paschal candle and then take part in a procession into the church, as a hymn is sung. The Easter Proclamation is then chanted by a deacon (if there is no deacon, a concelebraing minister does the task and if there is no concelebrating minister, it is entrusted to a lay cantor). The Service of the Word contains readings explicating the following topics: \\"The Creation\\", \\"The Covenant between God and the Earth\\", \\"Abraham's Trust in God\\", \\"Israel's Deliverance at the Red Sea\\", \\"Salvation Offered Freely to All\\", \\"A New Heart and a New Spirit\\", \\"New Life for God's People\\", and \\"Buried and Raised with Christ in Baptism\\". After each reading, a canticle is sung and then a prayer is offered. Following the hearing of the \\"record of God's saving deeds in history\\", the Gospel lesson is proclaimed by the minister and then he/she gives the sermon. The Service of the Baptismal Covenant follows with the baptism of catechumens and then their confirmation, as well as that of those who are being received into the United Methodist Church. The Service of the Table includes the celebration of Holy Communion, which is concluded by a benediction and recessional hymn. Byzantine Christianity: Eastern Orthodoxy and Greek Catholicism Anastasis, Chora Museum, Istanbul. St. George Greek Orthodox Church, in Adelaide, Australia). At paschal matins, a bishop holds the pascal trikiron and deacons (facing the bishop) hold paschal candles (Holy Cross Monastery in Wayne, West Virginia.) A deacon holds a red paschal deacon's candle at paschal matins (The Trinity Lavra, in Sergiyev Posad, Russia). Blessing Easter baskets in Lviv. In popular culture and for most believers, the Paschal vigil is the liturgy that commences at midnight; however, the vigil proper commences with vespers Saturday afternoon. =Saturday Midday= Commencing two hours before sundown according to the written rubrics,–¢v–ø–∏–∫–æÃÅ–Ω—ä, p 456 although generally in the late morning in actual practice,The Lenten Triodion, p 655 is great vespers with the Divine Liturgy. It is during this liturgy that catechumens are baptized and that fact, together with the lengthy Old Testament readings, shows that this liturgy is analogous to the Easter vigil described in the previous sections,See the section on the original eschatological character of the Paschal Vigil in Quartodecimans seemingly representing development from a common tradition. The Old Testament readings are: 1\\\\. Genesis 1:1-13; 2\\\\. Isaiah 60:1-16; 3\\\\. Exodus 12:1-11; 4\\\\. Jonah 1:1-4:11; 5\\\\. Joshua 5:10-15; 6\\\\. Exodus 13:20-15:19; 7\\\\. Zephaniah 3:8-15; 8\\\\. 3 Kings 17:8-24; 9\\\\. Isaiah 61:10-62:5; 10\\\\. Genesis 22:1-18; 11\\\\. Isaiah 61:1-9; 12\\\\. 4 Kings 4:8-37; 13\\\\. Isaiah 63:11-64:5; 14\\\\. Jeremiah 31:31-34; 15\\\\. Daniel 3:1-68. It is during these readings that catechumens may be baptized and chrismated, the order of which is given in the Book of Needs (ŒïœÖœáŒøŒªœåŒ≥ŒπŒøŒΩ; –¢—Ä–µ–±–Ω–∏–∫—ä) and is performed while most of the faithful and clergy remain in the church for the readings, the newly baptised being led back into the church during the singing of \\"As many as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ\\" (sung in place of the Trisagion).–ü–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–±–Ω–∏–∫—ä This liturgy recounts the Harrowing of Hell, at which time, according to Orthodox theology, the righteous dead were raised from Hades and entered into Paradise. This Good News of Christ's triumph over death, the Church teaches, was at that time revealed only to the departed. The revelation to the living occurred when his tomb was found empty \\"very early in the morning, on the first day of the week\\" () and this vigil recounts that discovery of the empty tomb. Also commemorated is the Passover of the Law, which according to the Gospel of John, was on the Sabbath when Christ lay in the tomb, and among the Old Testament readings is the story of the Exodus out of Egypt, that reading ending with the antiphonal singing of the Song of Moses (). Although this vespers liturgy begins Sunday in the usual manner, including the resurrectional stichera of the first tone, the feast of Pascha begins in the middle of the night, at the time Christ rose from the dead, while the text of and rubrics for Saturday's liturgy are found in the Triodion, the Lenten liturgical book. Before the Gospel reading, in place of the \\"Alleluia\\" sung at every other Liturgy of the year, is a prokeimenon during which, in the Russian tradition, all vestments and decorations of the church are quickly and dramatically changed from black to white.Sokolof, p 105 Another feature unique to this Liturgy is that the usual Cherubic Hymn is replaced by that from the Liturgy of St. James, \\"Let all mortal flesh keep silence\\". In Jerusalem, the Greek Orthodox Patriarch receives the Holy Fire and subsequently celebrates the Divine Liturgy at the Holy Sepulchre (i.e., empty tomb) of Christ on the very place where his body lay at the time of his Resurrection. At the closing of this vespers/liturgy is a modified artoklasia at which bread, wine, and dates or figs are blessed and partaken of by the faithful as sustenance for the remainder of the fast. Thereafter is prescribed the reading of the Acts of the Apostles, which Saint John Chrysostom stated was the best proof of the Resurrection, and which is prescribed as the reading between vespers and matins at Sunday vigils for all of the fifty days of Pentecost.–¢v–ø–∏–∫–æÃÅ–Ω—ä, p 472, for the subsequent Sundays, \\"Are read from the Acts from the beginning or from the Commentaries of Chrysostom In ancient times, the faithful would remain in the church throughout the night and thus the Paschal Vigil would have actually begun on the afternoon of Saturday and not ended until towards dawn on Sunday morning. In contemporary practice, however, there is typically a gap of some hours before this reading commences. =Saturday Midnight= The order of the Paschal Vigil is as follows (with some minor local variations): #After the reading of the Acts of the Apostles the Midnight Office is served \\"at the fourth hour of the night\\",–¢v–ø–∏–∫–æÃÅ–Ω—ä, p 457 generally, in practice, timed to end shortly before midnight,The Lenten Triodion, p 660 during which is sung again the Canon of Holy Saturday and are read commentaries of Saints Epiphanius of Cyprus and John Chrysostom.–¢v–ø–∏–∫–æÃÅ–Ω—ä, p 457-458 ##The epitaphios (shroud) depicting the dead body of Christ is solemnly venerated for a last time and then ceremoniously taken into the altar and laid on the Holy Table towards the end of the canon. ##After the dismissal of the midnight office all the lights in the church are extinguished except for the unsleeping flame on the Holy Table (altar), and all wait in silence and darkness. Where possible, the Holy Light arrives from the Holy Sepulchre during Holy Saturday afternoon and it is used to light anew the unsleeping flame. #At the \\"time for matins\\",–¢v–ø–∏–∫–æÃÅ–Ω—ä, p 458 usually in practice at the stroke of midnight,Sokolof, p 106 the priest censes around the Holy Table, and lights his candle from the unsleeping flame. The Holy Doors are opened, after which the priest exclaims \\"Come receive the light from the light that is never overtaken by night, and glorify Christ, Who is risen from the dead!\\" or a similar variation depending on tradition. After this proclamation, the priest approaches the congregation with the Paschal trikirion (lit from the unsleeping flame), and the people light their candles from the flame. #Two vessels of incense, one in the altar, the other in the middle of the church, are lit. The priest takes the blessing cross and the deacon a candle, and other priests take the Gospel Book and icon of the Resurrection, and process westward, opening the doors of the nave and the exterior doors and together with the people exit the church and go in procession three times around it while singing the hymn of the resurrection: \\"Thy resurrection, O Christ our Saviour, the angels sing in the heavens, and us on earth make worthy to glorify Thee with pure hearts\\" during which the church bells ring incessantly. This procession recounts the journey of the Myrrhbearers to the Tomb of Christ. During and after the procession, the priest carries a special triple candlestick, known as the Paschal trikirion, and the deacon also carries a special Paschal candle. The candles lit at midnight are held by the people throughout the entire liturgy, just as is done by the newly baptized. #Before the front doors of the church, the priest gives the blessing for the beginning of Matins. The clergy, followed by the people, sing the Paschal troparion with the Paschal Verses, and the Paschal greeting \\"Christ is risen!\\" \\"Truly He is risen!\\" is exchanged for the first time. Then, everyone enters the church singing the troparion. #The rest of Matins is celebrated according to special Paschal rubrics. Everything in the liturgy is intended to be exultant and full of light. Nothing in the liturgy is read, but everything is sung joyfully. During the Paschal Canon, the priests cense the church, continually exchanging the Paschal greeting with the faithful. Towards the end of matins the Paschal Homily of St. John Chrysostom is proclaimed. #Eggs which have been dyed red are blessed and are usually distributed to the people for the breaking of the Great Lenten fast. #The Paschal Hours, which are of entirely different text than their usual order, are sung where it is the custom. #The Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom is celebrated as usual, but with special features added that are unique to the Paschal season. #At the end of the liturgy, the Artos, a large loaf of leavened bread, which represents the Resurrected Christ, is blessed. This is then set next to the Icon of the Resurrection and is venerated by the faithful and carried in processions throughout Bright Week. #Baskets of food for the feast that follows are blessed with holy water. The liturgy typically finishes at 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. There is no prescribed liturgy on Sunday morning, everything for the feast having been celebrated during the Vigil. On Sunday afternoon there is a special, Paschal Vespers, at which the Gospel () is chanted in many languages (called \\"Vespers of Love\\" in some traditions). The week that begins on the Sunday of Pascha is called Bright Week, and is considered to be one continuous day. The Holy Doors of the iconostasis are left open from the moment they were opened at midnight throughout all of Bright Week, being closed only at the end of the Ninth Hour on Bright Saturday. Most of the unique features of the Paschal liturgies continue through the week and following the Liturgy there is a festive procession around the outside of the church every day and the entire week is a fast-free period, even on Wednesday and Friday, which are normally fast days throughout the year. Oriental Orthodoxy The Oriental Orthodox Churches consist of several different liturgical traditions. =Indian Orthodox Church= In the Indian Orthodox Church the vigil begins in the evening after the liturgy on Good Friday. The faithful spend time in the church reading from the scriptures and singing hymns. The church celebrates this most important festival in the church calendar, as per the Gregorian Calendar. Traditionally, the principal liturgy which corresponds to the Easter Vigil in Eastern and Western rites would be conducted in the early hours of the morning, typically at around 3 a.m. on Sunday. In many cities, however, the liturgy is conducted after 6:00 p.m. on Saturday; this is also the case for practical reasons in former Christian lands of the Oriental Orthodox rite which now have Muslim majorities. Easter marks the change in the set of prayers said and sung before the Eucharist. From Easter to the Feast of the Cross on September 14, the prayers follow the Liturgy of Easter. \\"News Of Great Joy!\\"Traditionally the Prayers of the Night and Midnight Hours are said. Then follows the most dramatic moment in the liturgy, the Announcement, when all the lights in the church are extinguished other than from the Altar candles and those held by those serving at the altar. The veil separating the sanctuary from the congregation is drawn aside. The chief celebrant stands in the centre of the sanctuary, holding a cross covered in a red embroidered cloth. This is the cross which has been used in the Good Friday liturgy for the procession commemorating the Carrying of the Cross to Calvary and then ritually embalmed and buried in a small coffin-shaped box behind the altar, to commemorate the Burial. The chief celebrant is flanked by the altar-servers, holding candles and hand-bells. In a loud voice, the chief celebrant announces to the congregation, ‚ÄúDearly beloved, I bring you all news of great joy. Our Lord Jesus Christ has resurrected from the dead and defeated His enemies.‚Äù Amid the ringing of the hand-bells and church-bells, the congregation responds, \\"Truly, we believe that He is risen!‚Äù This is done three times. An Indian Orthodox Easter processionThe Easter Procession follows, in which the entire congregation, holding lighted candles, participates with the celebrants and the altar servers. The cross, covered in the red veil, used in the Announcement, is carried in procession around the church. The hymn sung during the procession describes Christ's answer to Mary Magdalene, when she sees him at the tomb and mistakes him for the gardener: An Easter Cross :O Mary! I am the Gardener truly, :I am the One, Who established Paradise. :I am the One Who was killed, :I am the One Who entered the grave. :Touch Me not, for I have not ascended to the Father. :That I have gloriously arisen from that grave, :Give thou this good news to the disciples. Following this, the chief celebrant \\"celebrates\\" the Cross, by blessing the four directions while the Trisagion is said. The chief celebrant gives the Kiss of Peace, commemorating Christ's wishing peace on the Apostles. This is passed on to the congregation. On this day alone the Kiss of Peace is given twice. Prayers of the Morning hours follow, and the Holy Qurbana is then conducted as usual. Since Easter also marks the end of the Great 50-day Lent the Service of Reconciliation (Shubhkono) is also held on this day. Special prayers are said. Blessings from the Easter CrossAt the end of the liturgy, instead of the normal touching by the Chief Celebrant's hand of the foreheads of each member of the congregation in blessing, the Easter Cross is used. The Easter Cross on its stand in the sanctuaryFrom Easter to the Feast of Ascension, the Easter Cross is moved from the centre of the church to a stand inside the sanctuary. This stand, called Golgotha, is itself shaped as a large cross. The Easter Cross is set on its head, and the whole structure looks like a Patriarchal Cross. It had been set up in mid-Lent in the centre of the church and the faithful would kiss the cloth covering it while entering and leaving the church.

Hoppity discovers that the Songwriter and his wife are waiting for a \\"check thing\\" from the Famous Music publishing company for the songwriter's composition, \\"We're the Couple in the Castle.\\" With this money they can save the whole bug community. But C. Bagley Beetle and his henchmen \\"steal\\" the check, and the Dickens house is foreclosed. Days pass and with nothing improved nearly everyone in the lowlands loses faith in Hoppity's claim. To make matters worse the Dickenses lose their home when a skyscraper is built on the site. Mr. Beetle can force everyone to pay his exorbitant prices -- until he finds out that the building will be on his property too. Realizing that Hoppity was nearby and overheard him, he seals Hoppity inside the envelope that the Dickens' check came in, hiding it in a crack in a wall. Construction begins while everyone is at the wedding of Beetle and Honey; a weight from a surveyor's level that rips through the chapel causes the terrified bugs to flee back to the Lowlands (not realizing the whole parcel is endangered by the construction crew). Hoppity escapes when the construction crew demolishes the wall, freeing the envelope. Hoppity comes to Honey's rescue, battles Beetle and his henchmen, and wins. Hoppity tells everyone what happened and manages to get the check to Mr. Dickens. \\"We're the Couple in the Castle\\" becomes a massive hit. Meanwhile, Hoppity leads an exodus from the Lowlands to the top of the skyscraper, where he believes the Dickens' have built a new home and invited the bugs to live there. They get to the top, which at first appears to be barren, but the young bugs discover the Dickens have built a new penthouse with a \\"Garden of Paradise\\" just as Hoppity had described. Honey and the rest of the Lowlanders live there happily ever after in their new home. And as Ambrose looks over the edge, he remarks, \\"Look at all the human ones down there. They look just like a lot of little bugs!\\" Voice cast * Kenny Gardner as Dick * Gwen Williams as Mary * Jack Mercer as Mr. Bumble / Swat * Tedd Pierce as C.

Mr. Bug Goes to Town is similar in concept to Gulliver‚Äôs Travels with its large cast of characters, complicated crowd scenes, and the contrasting scale of tiny characters against the gigantic human world. In Mr. Bug, the environment is central to the picture. While the lead characters, Hoppity the grasshopper and Honey Bee, do not lead the story as clearly as Disney characters do, it is the situation that propels the plot combined with colorful supporting comical characters.Pointer, Ray (2016). The Art and Inventions of Max Fleischer: American Animation Pioneer, McFarland & Co. Publishers. Pg. 304. Mr. Bug Goes to Town was beset by problems due to the rift between Max and Dave Fleischer that began during the production of Gulliver's Travels. From that point on, they communicated with each other via internal memos while working in the same building. Running a major animated cartoon studio solely by written communique turned out to be \\"a sort of tragicomedy.\\"Fleischer, Richard (2005). Out of the Inkwell: Max Fleischer and the Animation Revolution. University of Kentucky Press. Pg. 110 Paramount was acutely aware of the problems between the Fleischer brothers and structured their contract for the completion of Mr. Bug in an unusual way, allowing for the resignation of either brother following its completion. When Paramount renewed the Fleischer contract on May 24, 1941, a clause stipulated that the brothers deliver signed letters of resignation to Paramount to be used at the studio's discretion. Post-production concluded in Hollywood just before Thanksgiving, and Dave tendered his resignation one month before the scheduled release. Mr. Bug Goes to Town was the first animated feature to give screen credit to the voice actors. The voices were provided by actor Stan Freed (Hoppity) and Pauline Loth (Honey). The supporting characters were voiced by members of the studio staff including Jack Mercer, the voice of Popeye (Mr. Bumble, Swat the Fly), and storymen Tedd Pierce (C. Bagley Beetle), Carl Meyer (Smack the Mosquito), Pinto Colvig (Mr. Creeper), Margie Hines (Mrs. Ladybug), and Mae Questel (Buzz the Beescout). Singer Kenny Gardner and actress Gwen Williams portrayed \\"The Human Ones,\\" Songwriter Dick Dickens and his wife, Mary. Book and other merchandise The film received a book adaptation which was released around the same time - it features new characters along with the ones from the film and goes further on key plots. For example, in the film Honey is aware of Beetle's romantic interest, expressing dislike to him but willing to make the sacrifice if it means everyone can live safely on his property away from the broken fence. However, in the book, Hoppity is made aware of this fact by Ambrose the Bee Scout, making Beetle's conflict with Hoppity more apparent from the start. Whether this was part of the film's script is unknown. The film also inspired a Mr. Bug Goes to Town board game and a series of trading cards. Release Mr. Bug Goes to Town was previewed on December 5, 1941 in advance of its scheduled Christmas release. While it was well-received by critics, theater operators rejected it. Two days later, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor signaled America's entrance into World War II, and Paramount canceled the Christmas release. Three weeks later, Paramount president Barney Balaban activated Max Fleischer's resignation. Paramount finally released the film in California on February 13, 1942 (February 20 in New York City). In the UK, it opened during January 1942 under the name Hoppity Goes to Town. Mr. Bug was a financial disaster. Paramount reorganized Fleischer Studios as Famous Studios.Barrier, Michael (1999).

Pgs. 303-305. .[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2007/07/27/AR2007072700732.html Dispute From an article at the Washington Post website. Before the film's release, Walter Lantz, Paul Terry, and Leon Schlesinger all considered producing animated feature films, but after seeing the disappointing box-office of this film and the initial failures of Walt Disney's new films Pinocchio and Fantasia (both 1940), they cancelled any potential animated feature projects. Harlan Ellison described vivid memories of having to outwit his family in order to see Mr. Bug Goes to Town for free on his birthday in his book Harlan Ellison's Watching. He credits his exploit as having fostered his rebellious nature rather than remaining a sweet obedient child. He never got to see the entire film until it came out on videocassette, and he watched it frequently throughout his adult life.Harlan Ellison, \\"In Which the Critic Blames It All on a Warped Childhood.\\" Harlan Ellison's Watching (Underwoood-Miller 1989). Paramount later re-released Mr. Bug as Hoppity Goes to Town (the original title is a parody of the title of the 1936 film Mr. Deeds Goes to Town). The film cost $713,511 to make, but by 1946 had only made $241,000 back, and was withdrawn from circulation. Under the reissue title, Hoppity has had multiple re- releases on home video throughout the 1970s (most with inferior image quality) to its DVD release by Legend Films, in which the studio re-titled the film again to Bugville (presumably to position against Pixar's A Bug's Life). The film was acquired in the 1950s by National Telefilm Associates (which became Republic) and enjoyed a renewed popularity as a staple on local \\"movie classics\\" shows such as Family Classics on Chicago's WGN. The film (as Hoppity Goes to Town) was officially released by Republic Pictures on VHS and LaserDisc in May 1989.https://www.amazon.com/dp/6303258158 Although the NTA did forget to renew the copyright for some films, Mr. Bug Goes to Town was one of various films that did get its copyright renewed. Despite the fact that the film is still copyrighted (by Republic successor Melange Pictures, managed by parent company ViacomCBS, which also owns Paramount Pictures), public domain companies have released the film on VHS and DVD.Mr. Bug Goes to Town Info at Turner Classic Movies Possibly due to the public domain video releases that have surfaced, Paramount hasn't licensed the movie a DVD release to either Lionsgate or Olive Films. In Japan, the movie was released on December 19, 2009 as part of Studio Ghibli's Ghibli Museum Library. A DVD was released in April 2010 by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in Japan, and it has been reported to be a restoration using NTA re-release elements.Cartoon Brew: Disney releases \\"Mr. Bug\\" in Japan Recently, Mr. Bug, along with many other Fleischer-produced cartoons (including the Fleischers' previous film, Gulliver's Travels), was restored from the original three-strip negatives by the UCLA Film and Television Archive, and a few art-house theaters have recently screened the restoration (which features the original titles). On October 21, 2012, the Turner Classic Movies channel debuted the film, transferred from an original 35mm Technicolor release print owned by the Museum of Modern Art Department of Film, for the first time on television in a special hosted by Robert Osborne and Jerry Beck dedicated to rare animated films, including Gulliver's Travels, Lotte Reiniger's The Adventures of Prince Achmed, the UPA cartoons and the silent cartoons of 1907 to 1932 of the New York Studios. Mr. Bug Goes to Town was planned to be released on Blu-ray in June 2017 from Thunderbean Animation. However it has currently been put on hold as of July 2017.

Career  Born in Madrid, he began his career in the 1960s with series like Cinco por infinito, published in English by Continuity Comics as Zero Patrol (heavily retouched by editor Neal Adams). 'Wolff' by Maroto was published in the UK by New English Library in the magazine Dracula. Dracula was published in the US by the Warren Publishing Company under the title Dracula Book 1 in 1972; the cover was by Esteban Maroto. In the 1970s he started to be known in his own country when the magazine Trinca (comic) published Alma de Drag√≥n. He designed the \\"metal bikini\\" for the character Red Sonja, in Savage Tales #3, Comixscene #5, and in the first issue of The Savage Sword of Conan and pencilled her first solo story, which was inked by Neal Adams and Ernie Chan. He also redesigned Satana for Marvel Comics and drew her second solo story in Vampire Tales #3. In issue 4 of the same series he drew an outstanding adaptation of the short story \\"The Drifting Snow\\" by August Derleth. Maroto joined Warren Publishing in November 1971 when artists from the Spanish agency Selecciones Illustrada started appearing in their three horror magazines, Creepy, Eerie and Vampirella. Maroto's first story, \\"Wolfhunt\\", appeared in Vampirella #14. He would eventually draw 101 stories for them, more than any other artist except Jose Ortiz. Maroto won the Warren Award for best artist/writer in 1972, and his story \\"A Scream in the Forest\\" won the best art in a story award in 1973. Maroto remained with Warren until its folding in 1983. Two Maroto's series were reprinted in Eerie and Vampirella. Manly, renamed Dax the Warrior, was reprinted in issues 39‚Äì41, 43‚Äì50 and 52 of Eerie. The whole issue 59 was dedicated to Dax, reprinting the majority of these stories. His series Tomb of the Gods was reprinted in Vampirella issues 17‚Äì22. He also contributed black and white illustrations for the Roger Zelazny book Changeling and Larry Niven's The Magic Goes Away. Maroto subsequently worked on the series Amethyst, Zatanna, Atlantis Chronicles, The Savage Sword of Conan, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, Dracula: Vlad the Impaler and X-Men Unlimited. In Italy, he worked for Sergio Bonelli Editore's series Brendon.

It is often called I'm Alright Jack & The Beanstalk. History The album has a convoluted history. Following the Final Damnation concerts in 1988, the original line-up of the band (singer Dave Vanian, guitarist Brian James, bass guitarist Captain Sensible and drummer Rat Scabies) had briefly collaborated to record the track \\"Prokofiev\\", which had a low-key USA-only release on the independent Skinnies Cut label. Over the following months, Scabies continued to collaborate with James, Kris Dollimore, guitarist with The Godfathers, on demos. James soon moved on. Scabies and Dollimore then recruited bass player Moose (formerly with New Model Army), the trio travelling to Scotland to work on further demos. Initial attempts to persuade Vanian to join the project were unsuccessful, as the singer was dismissive of the demo songs. Scabies abandoned the material, and began working with Alan Lee Shaw (who had previously played guitar for The Rings, The Maniacs, The Physicals and Brian James' band Brains). This time the new material progressed further, Dollimore rejoined the project and a number of bassists were auditioned before Moose returned. Alternative singers were suggested (including recent Take That departed Robbie Williams, and Joe Strummer) before Vanian was contacted again. Vanian reversed his original decision and completed the new line-up as singer. A period of rehearsal followed, and the new band debuted at The Dome in Tufnell Park under the moniker The Damagement. At this point the decision was taken to revert to The Damned banner. The new line-up performed a BBC Radio 1 session in November 1993, and then toured the UK, U.S. and Japan. The group's recordings had built a cult following in Japan, and following excellent reception of the new material at the gigs there, Toshiba offered the group the funding to record it as an album. Recording took place at the late Connie Plank's studio in Germany, before additional tracks were overdubbed at the Stoneroom Studio back in the UK. None of the Scabies/Dollimore material was used, all songs coming from Scabies/Shaw (as a side-note, Scabies is listed under his real name of Chris Millar in the writing credits). James Taylor of James Taylor Quartet fame added Hammond organ to some tracks, while ex-Sex Pistols bass player Glen Matlock played on \\"Tailspin\\" and part of \\"Never Could Believe\\". The results were issued by Toshiba as Not of This Earth in Japan in November 1995, with a remix of \\"Prokofiev\\" as an unlisted 'hidden' track. In April 1996, the Marble Orchard label issued the album in the UK, now titled I'm Alright Jack & the Beanstalk (inspired by a phrase used by an acquaintance of Scabies'). This had apparently been the planned title of the album all along, but had been considered too much of a mouthful for the Japanese market. The cover was a 3D lenticular design, using the Japanese artwork as a background for a risqu√© animation. This version of the album was also issued in Germany and Sweden. The album also saw a release in the USA in 1996, but this release, on the Cleopatra label, was titled Not of This Earth once again, and featured totally different cover artwork. By this time, the new line-up was breaking up. Vanian wanted to continue touring to cover the costs of his divorce, and was performing with his Phantom Chords project. Scabies was less keen to continue saturating their live work, fearing playing to smaller audiences. The pair also disagreed over the writing of the album. A proposed tour of small venues was shelved, apart from a one-off show at Plymouth Cooperage, the line-up's final live performance. The band split in August 1995, and by August 1996 would be reforming once more ‚Äì this time with Vanian accompanied by Captain Sensible instead of Scabies. The Vanian/Scabies/Shaw/Dollimore/Moose line-up have featured on two other Damned releases ‚Äì the remix EP Testify and the live album Molten Lager. Much confusion has sprung up about the Not of This Earth/I'm Alright Jack & the Beanstalk album. The Damned's official site formerly carried the unhelpful message \\"Not intended for release in this form\\" on its discography page on the album, and the music press often referred to 2001's Grave Disorder as the group's first release since Anything in 1986. Several sources list it as a compilation album. To further the confusion about the album's name, Castle Music reissued it as I'm Alright Jack & the Beanstalk in the USA in 2002, with Imperial doing the same in Japan. Recently, thanks to the ease of importing CDs and the rise of internet shopping, copies of the US release of Not of This Earth can be easily found in Europe, with Cleopatra also reissuing the album in The Damned Box Set in 1999 (with the Testify remix EP, and compilation The Chaos Years). The Castle release (also reissued in the UK in 2002) featured a non-lenticular sleeve based on the original Japanese artwork, and also included the four tracks cut at the 29 November 1993 Radio 1 session as bonus tracks.

Before that, Sandberg served as chief of staff for United States Secretary of the Treasury, Lawrence Summers. In 2012, she was named in the Time 100, an annual list of the most influential people in the world. , Sandberg is reported to be worth over US$1.8 billion, due to her stock holdings in Facebook and other companies.  Early life and education  Sandberg was born in 1969 in Washington, D.C., to a Jewish family, the daughter of Adele (n√©e Einhorn) and Joel Sandberg, and the oldest of three children. Her father is an ophthalmologist, and her mother was a college teacher of French language. Her family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, when she was two years old. She attended North Miami Beach High School, where she graduated with a 4.646 grade point average. She was sophomore class president, became a member of the National Honor Society, and was on the senior class executive board. Sandberg taught aerobics in the 1980s while in high school. In 1987, Sandberg enrolled at Harvard College. She graduated in 1991 summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a Bachelor of Arts in economics and was awarded the John H. Williams Prize for the top graduating student in economics. While at Harvard, she co-founded an organization called Women in Economics and Government. She also met Professor Lawrence Summers, who became her mentor and thesis adviser. Summers recruited her to be his research assistant at the World Bank, where she worked for approximately one year on health projects in India dealing with leprosy, AIDS, and blindness. In 1993, she enrolled at Harvard Business School and in 1995 she earned her MBA with highest distinction. In her first year of business school, she earned a fellowship. CareerEarly career= After graduating from business school in the spring of 1995, Sandberg worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company for approximately one year (1995‚Äì1996). From 1996 to 2001 she again worked for Larry Summers, who was then serving as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. Sandberg assisted in the Treasury's work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis.

Zuckerberg had no formal search for a Chief Operating Officer (COO), but thought of Sandberg as \\"a perfect fit\\" for this role. In March 2008, Facebook announced the hiring of Sandberg for the role of COO and her leaving Google. After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was \\"primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow.\\" By late spring, Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, \\"with the ads discreetly presented\\"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable. According to Facebook, she oversees the firm's business operations including sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy, and communications. In 2012, she became the eighth member (and the first woman) of Facebook's board of directors. In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO, she held approximately 41 million shares in the company; after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, amounting to a stake of 0.5% in the company, worth about $1 billion.Sheryl Sandberg sells half her stake in Facebook, The Irish Times, April 2, 2014 Criticism The New York Times published a report in 2018 detailing Sandberg's role in handling Facebook's public relations after revelations of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and its Cambridge Analytica data scandal.Frankel, Sheera et al (November 14, 2018) \\"Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook‚Äôs Leaders Fought Through Crisis.\\" New York Times.

In 2015, she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation. In 2016, she delivered the Commencement Address at the University of California, Berkeley graduation ceremony. It was the first time she spoke publicly about her husband's death, and stressed the importance of resilience. The following year she delivered the Commencement Address to Virginia Tech's Class of 2017. On June 8, 2018, she gave the Commencement Address for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA. = Lean In = Sandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-authored by Nell Scovell and published by Knopf on March 11, 2013. The book concerns business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism. As of the fall of 2013, the book had sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch. Lean In is intended for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment. Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone. Criticism of the book includes claims that Sandberg is \\"too elitist\\" and another that she is \\"tone-deaf\\" to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace. For example the book has been criticized for overlooking the struggles of mothers who may not be able to \\"lean in.\\" Sandberg mentions both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is \\"acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families\\" and that her intention was to \\"offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook.\\" Furthermore, following the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica data breach scandal, Sandberg's willingness to actually lean in has been put into question. \\"She's not leaning in at all,\\" McNamee said, in a reference Sandberg's widely read book published five years ago. \\"If ever there was a time for her to lean in, this is it.\\" In her book, she does suggest other women to lean in during challenges. Instead, she has been perceived as a COO who avoids engaging in this crisis. \\"Sandberg, the architect of the business model that is now the subject of so much scrutiny, has remained silent in public.\\" In her book she recognizes those who do tackle crises: = Option B = Sandberg released her second book, Option B, in April 2017. Option B is co-authored with Adam Grant, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. The book puts emphasis on grief and resilience in challenges within life. It offers practical tips for creating resilience in the family and community. 2.75 million copies have been sold since publication. = Ban Bossy = In March 2014, Sandberg and Lean In sponsored the Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media campaign designed to discourage the word bossy from general use due to its perceived harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with spokespersons including Beyonc√©, Jennifer Garner, and Condoleezza Rice among others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word. = Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation = In November 2016, Sandberg renamed her Lean In Foundation to the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. This new foundation will serve as an umbrella for LeanIn.Org and a new organization around her book, Option B. Sandberg also transferred roughly $100,000,000 in Facebook stock to fund the foundation and other charitable endeavors.  Personal life  Sandberg married Brian Kraff in 1993 and divorced a year later. In 2004, she married Dave Goldberg, then an executive with Yahoo! and later CEO of SurveyMonkey. The couple has a son and a daughter. Sandberg and Goldberg frequently discussed being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage. Sandberg also raised the issue of single parenting conflicting strongly with professional and economic development in America. On May 1, 2015, Dave Goldberg died unexpectedly, and his death was originally reported as resulting from sustaining a head trauma falling from a treadmill, while the couple was vacationing in Mexico. Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's cause of death was due to an arrhythmia, and not due to falling from a treadmill. In May 2019, it was reported that Sandberg and Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick had split after three years of dating. On February 3, 2020, she announced her engagement on Facebook to Kelton Global CEO Tom Bernthal. Sandberg lives in Menlo Park, California. = Politics = Sandberg supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Former First Lady Michelle Obama said Sandberg‚Äôs belief that women can always ‚Äúhave it all‚Äù is ‚Äúa lie.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not always enough to lean in because that shit doesn‚Äôt work all the time,‚Äù Obama reportedly said.

He was born in Flint, Michigan, to a family that had many former employees of General Motors amongst its members. Hamper also worked for General Motors in Michigan for several years and wrote for Michael Moore's Flint Voice. He has also worked as a correspondent on several of Moore's television projects. Ben also hosted and wrote comedy for Take No Prisoners TV show in Flint. This program aired on local community access and documented the Flint underground music scene from 1989 to 1998. In 2006, Hamper launched a new radio show, Soul Possession, on community radio station WNMC-FM in Traverse City, Michigan. The show focuses on his extensive collection of obscure soul and funk records and can be heard Friday evenings between 9 and 11 pm ET via the station's audio stream. In 2010, Hamper launched another radio show, Head For The Hills, also on WNMC, focusing on his obscure collection of classic and obscure Country records and can be heard Sundays between 10AM and 12PM ET. His memoir, Rivethead: Tales From the Assembly Line, published in 1991, is an autobiographical account of his life in Flint and subsequent employment on the General Motors assembly line between 1977 and 1988 when he was laid off.  Television and film  Hamper has appeared in a number of high-profile TV and film roles, most notably in association with Michael Moore. In fact Hamper was at Moore's side for most of Moore's career from his very early days to his TV shows in the mid 1990s. Hamper first began writing articles for the Flint Voice. In fact, on the day Moore and Hamper were to meet to discuss Hamper's writing for the Flint Voice, Harry Chapin ‚Äî a long time benefactor for the paper ‚Äî was killed in a car accident. Hamper turned around and went home. He did however end up with a writing assignment and rather quickly became a local celebrity who wrote scathing true stories of life on the assembly line. He was kept on when the Flint Voice became the statewide Michigan Voice where he was again one of the more popular writers. When Moore left for Mother Jones in 1986, he brought Hamper over with him and put him on the cover. Moore was fired shortly after. Hamper was asked to keep writing for Mother Jones, but out of loyalty chose not to continue {Rivethead: Tales from the Assembly Line, pg 220}. When production of Moore's documentary film Roger & Me began in early February 1987, Moore asked Hamper to recall one of his infamous panic attacks stemming from his work at the GM Truck & Bus plant on Van Slyke Road. In the film, Hamper is shown shooting basketball hoops in the yard at a mental health facility. After Roger & Me, Hamper's book Rivethead became a national bestseller. He then appeared on the cover of The Wall Street Journal and was interviewed by NBC and CBS for various news shows. Matt Dillon was tapped to star in the film adaption of Rivethead, with Richard Linklater writing and directing, but the project did not move beyond early stages of development. In 1995, Hamper had a memorable cameo appearance in Michael Moore's film Canadian Bacon and was later tapped as a correspondent for both TV Nation and The Awful Truth documentary television shows. These were the last official associations with Moore, but the two remain good friends to this day.

Very basic in its design and use, the Rogue featured a 32-note keyboard and two VCOs. VCO number 2 is tunable between a half-step below to an octave above VCO number 1. This allows the Rogue to play atonal sounds like the Moog Prodigy. The Rogue did not have features to allow the user full flexibility to program the patch settings, however the VCF and the VCA were simple in operation. The design of the hard-wired patch system was well thought out (considering its size and cost) and a wide variety of sounds and modulation effects are possible. The Rogue also includes a Sample-and-Hold feature that the Prodigy does not. The synthesizer is most commonly used for its powerful bass. The Rogue is similar in some respects to the famous ARP Odyssey, though smaller and slightly less versatile. Moog Music was criticized for repackaging the Rogue as the Taurus II, changing the design to a pedal-operated synthesizer with little difference in sound quality. The Rogue is very similar in design and sound to the less-expensive Moog Concertmate MG-1, also made by Moog Music, but re-branded for Realistic around the same time for home use.

They live in the rural town of Smallville, Kansas. In most versions of Superman's origin story, Jonathan and Martha were the first to come across the rocket that brought the infant Kal-El, with their adopting him shortly thereafter, renaming him Clark Kent, \\"Clark\\" being Martha's maiden name. The Kents are usually portrayed as caring parents who instill within Clark a strong sense of morals, and they encourage Clark to use his powers for the betterment of humanity. In a few continuities, Martha is also the one who creates Clark's superhero costume. In DC Comics continuity before John Byrne's 1986 reboot of the Superman story, the Kents die shortly after Clark's high school graduation.Superman #161 (May 1963) In post-Crisis continuity, they both remain alive even after Clark becomes an adult, with the Kents as supporting characters until Pa Kent's death during an attack by the supervillain Brainiac.Action Comics #870 (December 2008) Ma Kent remains a supporting character in Superman comics until 2011's The New 52 continuity reboot, in which both she and her husband are deceased having been killed by a drunk driver. They are brought back to life in 2019, in the aftermath of the DC Rebirth relaunch. BiographyGolden and Silver Age versions= Although a \\"passing motorist\\" is described as having found the infant Kal-El in the character's first appearance in 1938's Action Comics #1, 1939's Superman #1 introduces Superman's adoptive parents to the mythos, with \\"Mary Kent\\" being the only parent given a name. The Kents' first names vary in stories from the 1940s. A 1942 Superman novel, The Adventures of Superman by George Lowther, gave the names \\"Eben and Sarah Kent\\", which were also used in the Adventures of Superman television series, but the first extensive retelling of Superman's origin in Superman #53 (July‚ÄìAugust 1948, billed as the \\"10th Anniversary Issue!\\") names them \\"John and Mary Kent\\". This issue firmly establishes that it is the Kents who discover the infant Kal-El. The Kents take him to a \\"home for foundlings\\" and express an interest in adopting him, to which the home readily agrees after suffering the disruption of the infant's growing abilities. This story also establishes that \\"Clark\\" is Mary Kent's maiden name. Mary and John Kent die of natural causes as \\"Clark grew to manhood\\", with John on his deathbed imploring Clark to become \\"a powerful force for good\\" and suggesting that Clark is a \\"Superman\\", a name adopted by Clark in the story's final panel. Oddly, no mention of \\"Superboy\\" is included, though that feature had already been established. Pa Kent is first named Jonathan in Adventure Comics v1 #149 (Feb 1950). Ma Kent is first named Marthe in Superboy v1 #12 (Jan-Feb 1951) and Martha in subsequent appearances. Her full name is given as Martha Hudson Clark Kent in answer to a letter writer's query in Superman v1 #148 (Oct 1961). Later stories, after the early 1960s introduction of DC's Multiverse system, declare that the early version of the Kents are named \\"John and Mary Kent\\" and live on the world of \\"Earth-Two\\", home of the Golden Age DC superheroes, while the more modern Jonathan and Martha Kent live on the world of \\"Earth-One\\", home of the Silver Age DC superheroes. Martha and Jonathan Kent, as they appear in comics from the 1970s and 1980s. From New Adventures of Superboy #1 (January 1980). Art by Kurt Schaffenberger. The Kents made few appearances in Superman stories until the introduction of the Superboy comic book series in 1949. In this series, they are regular supporting characters of the teenage superhero. The Superboy stories establish the Kents' backstory. Jonathan, a former race car driver,Superboy #196 (Sep. 1973) is a farmer on a farm just outside Smallville. After he and Martha find the toddler Kal-El in his rocket, they take him to the Smallville Orphanage and later formally adopt him, naming him \\"Clark\\". They soon discover that Clark possesses a fantastic array of superpowers. Around the time Clark starts school, the Kents sell their farm, and the family moves into Smallville, where they open a general store.Superboy #78 (Jan. 1960) During Clark's early grade school years, Jonathan trains young Clark in the use of his superpowers to the best of his knowledge while urging him to keep the use of his powers a secret. At the age of eight,New Adventures of Superboy #1 (Jan. 1980) Clark begins a superhero career as Superboy. Martha creates Superboy's costume out of the blankets inside the rocket that brought him to Earth, and Jonathan helps him to create a means of making Superboy and Clark appear to be different people by developing Clark's secret identity as a mild-mannered, reserved individual. The Kents assist their adopted son on many adventures as Superboy. In Superboy vol. 1 #145 (March 1968), Jonathan and Martha are rejuvenated physically and appear younger due to the influence of an alien serum. After this, Jonathan and Martha were drawn by artists as late middle-aged ‚Äî as opposed to elderly ‚Äî in appearance until Superman's 1986 reboot. After Clark graduates from high school, Jonathan and Martha take a vacation to the Caribbean Islands, where they contract a fatal tropical disease after handling materials from a pirate's treasure chest they had exhumed; despite Superboy's best efforts, Martha dies, with Jonathan dying soon thereafter. Before dying, Jonathan reminds Clark that he must always use his powers for the benefit of humanity. Clark mourns his parents and moves to Metropolis to attend college. In Superman and Superboy stories prior to 1986, both the Kents die before the beginning of Clark's adult career as Superman. However, Jonathan did receive one opportunity to see his adopted son as the Man of Steel. After Superboy assists a group of interplanetary farmers from an alien world,New Adventures of Superboy #5 (May 1980) they repay him by granting Jonathan's subconscious desire to see Clark in the future as Superman. Using their advanced technology, they place an artificially aged Jonathan years into the future, warping reality to make it appear that he had never died, and had maintained contact with his son all along. After spending 30 hours in the future with his adult son, Jonathan is returned by the aliens to his proper time period. The incident is removed from everyone's conscious memory, and the timeline is restored to normal.Action Comics #507-508 (May‚ÄìJune 1980) =Modern Age versions=The Man of Steel Jonathan and Martha Kent in Action Comics #597 (February 1988). Art by John Byrne. After comics writer John Byrne rewrote Superman's origin in the 1986 The Man of Steel limited series, one of the changes he made was keeping Jonathan and Martha Kent alive into Clark's adulthood. The Kents have the same role as in the earlier stories, instilling within Clark the morals needed to become a strong and heroic figure. A Legion of Super-Heroes/Superman team-up that was written to explain why the Legion still exists even without Superboy confirms that post-Crisis Jonathan and Martha Kent are younger than their pre-Crisis counterparts, explaining in part why they live on in Clark's adult life.Action Comics #591 (August 1987) In this version of events, after a Kryptonian \\"birthing matrix\\" lands on Earth, Jonathan and Martha find a newborn infant inside. Taking the infant in just before a major snowstorm strikes (that buried Smallville in snow for a number of months and cut off outsiders' access to the Kent family farm), the couple decides to pass the infant off as their own natural child, naming him \\"Clark\\", exploiting Martha's past miscarriages to justify their decision to keep their 'latest pregnancy' a secret. Clark's powers slowly develop, with his powers fully emerging once he reaches his late teens. After Clark's high school graduation, the Kents tell Clark about his true origins, and Clark leaves Smallville to explore the outside world. After Clark moves to Metropolis, Jonathan and Martha help Clark to create a superhero identity. They are later present when Clark finally discovers a holographic message in his ship from his biological father, Jor-El; prior to this the Kents had assumed that the ship was from another country's space program. In the Man of Steel mini-series and afterwards, the Kents remain farmers through Clark's adult years, although a storyline features them having opened a general store in Smallville. Although Jonathan is still alive in the comics, he suffers a heart attack after The Death of Superman storyline, and he meets Clark in the afterlife and encourages him to return to life with him, suggested to be one of several factors that allowed Superman to return to life. The Kents' post-Crisis history is more fully fleshed out in the late 1980s limited series The World of Smallville, with Jonathan's ancestors' history more fully explored in the 1990s limited series The Kents. Following Clark reaching adulthood and moving to Metropolis, the Kents continue to play a prominent role in Clark's life, and also in the lives of his extended alien family. When the Matrix Supergirl arrives on earth, she moves in for a time with the Kents, who treat her a like a daughter despite such issues as her relationship with Lex Luthor (currently posing as his own son after his brain was transplanted into a clone) and her own guilt about 'subverting' the life of Linda Danvers when Matrix unwittingly merged with the dying Linda, Jonathan helping Linda's father Fred adapt to their mutual daughter's status. The Kents later take in Clark's half-clone, Kon-El, also known as Superboy. They give him the name Conner Kent and care for him in much the same was as they did Clark. However, Conner is not Clark, and while he appreciates everything the Kents did, he does not much like living on a farm. The couple find themselves childless again when Conner dies during the Infinite Crisis. Afterwards, Kara Zor-El, (Clark's recently discovered cousin) visits, questioning the Kents as to why Clark never asked that she live with them.Supergirl vol. 5, #9 (October 2006) The Kents also help Lois and Clark in dealing with their adopted son, Chris Kent. Birthright The Kents were again altered in 2003's Superman: Birthright limited series by Mark Waid, which again revised Superman's origins. Jonathan is portrayed as having a more strained relationship with his son, mainly due to Jonathan's childhood experiences with his overbearing father, and he and Martha are depicted as far younger at the time of Clark adopting his Superman identity than in past portrayals, appearing here to be scarcely middle-aged. The younger version of the Kents as depicted in Superman: Birthright. Art by Leinil Francis Yu. The Kents' appearances were altered to resemble the younger versions of actor John Schneider and actress Annette O'Toole, who portray the Kents in the Smallville television series. Although now shown wearing glasses, Jonathan has a full head of blond hair, and Martha has long red tresses. This younger portrayal of the Kents has persisted in the regular DC Universe since Birthright was published. One of the major subplots of Birthright is a rift between Jonathan and Clark. Although not unprecedented (the post-Crisis Jonathan was critical of Clark for \\"showing off\\" by playing football with his human peers, and the Smallville Jonathan is often in disagreement with Clark over the protection of his son's secret), the strain in their relationship is such that the father and son are barely speaking to each other at the opening of the series. Jonathan has conflicting feelings regarding Clark's powers and his decision to use it for the benefit of humanity; he seems to feel that he has lost the affections of his newly adult son, partly due to Clark's fascination with his Kryptonian origins. Unlike most previous incarnations of Jonathan Kent, the Birthright Jonathan is not particularly encouraging or instrumental in the formation of Clark's Superman identity or mission, although over the course of the series, father and son are eventually reconciled. In Birthright, Martha is sassier and more at odds with her husband over how Clark should live than in previous comic incarnations. Because Jonathan has little to do with the creation of the Superman identity, Martha plays a more prominent role in this regard. She is also far more technologically savvy than ever before, communicating with Clark via encrypted e-mail as he travels around the world. In contrast, Jonathan is more withdrawn, struggling with insecurities and anger issues that stem from his treatment by his verbally abusive father, Matthew Kent. After Birthright After the \\"Infinite Crisis\\" storyline, Superman's continuity was revised yet again from the Birthright origin, as briefly summarized in Action Comics #850. Although various aspects of his past are clearly retconned from the Birthright version, there is little to specifically indicate that the Kents themselves have been substantially changed. They are initially still depicted with younger appearances and the Schneider and O'Toole likenesses; however, this eventually gives way to older, more traditionally generic, gray- haired representations. Jonathan and Martha Kent with Clark Kent on the cover of Superman: Secret Origin #1 (Nov. 2009) art by Gary Frank. A new origin story for Superman was revealed in Geoff Johns and Gary Frank's Superman: Secret Origin. This origin for the most part follows closely with the Silver Age history. For example, Clark's Superboy storyline is re-introduced, as is his history with the Legion of Super-Heroes. Also, unlike Birthright, Jonathan is shown to have an equal standing as Martha in helping Clark create his heroic identity. Martha and Jonathan are the ones who suggest Clark dons a superhero costume, which initially Clark is not fond of. In this version, the Kents are both shown to already have graying hair when they find the baby Kal- El, but are still drawn to be considerably younger, more in-tune to their Birthright counterparts; as the miniseries progresses into Clark's adulthood and debut as Superman, they visibly age and their appearances come to match those in The Man of Steel. This version also had Kal-El's spaceship not sensitive to Kryptonian DNA; anyone who got within proximity of the ship was shown the prerecorded message left by Jor-El and Lara, as well as scene of Kryptonian life. Jonathan and Martha are shown images of Krypton, although it is Martha who appears more fascinated with the scientifically advanced and beautiful race of Kryptonians. At the conclusion of Geoff Johns and Gary Frank's \\"Brainiac\\" story arc, Pa Kent suffers a fatal heart attack during Brainiac's attack on Earth's sun. His funeral, attended by all his family and friends from Smallville, is shown in the Superman: New Krypton Special in which Martha, refusing to be a hindrance for their son, asks Clark to leave her alone at the farm and go attend the more pressing matter of Kandor's restoration and transformation in New Krypton. Despite her reassurances to Clark that she will be okay, Martha begins to suffer from loneliness at being alone on the Kent Farm. Sensing that Martha needed a friend, and also feeling lonely without Clark, Krypto arrives on the front porch, offering Martha much needed companionship. Following the \\"Final Crisis\\" storyline, Clark returns from the 31st Century along with a newly resurrected Conner Kent. Conner moves back in with Martha, finding a new appreciation for Smallville and the farm, following his death. This further helps to assuage Martha's loneliness, as she states that she disliked living in a \\"quiet\\" house. During the 2009 \\"Blackest Night\\" storyline, the body of the deceased Earth-Two Superman is turned into a Black Lantern, and goes on a killing spree through Smallville, culminating with the abduction of Pa's coffin from his grave, and the kidnapping of Ma by the Black Lantern Lois Lane of Earth-Two. The Earth-Two Superman declares that Ma and Pa will soon be back in each other's arms.Blackest Night: Superman #1 (October 2009) While Conner and Clark deal with Earth-Two Superman, Martha is left to deal with the Black Lantern Lois, who chases Martha into the cornfield.Blackest Night: Superman #2 (November 2009) However, Martha fights back against Black Lantern Lois, with the help of Krypto. Together, the two of them light the cornfield on fire, and Krypto temporarily severs Lois' connection to the Black Lantern Ring, allowing for Martha to survive.Blackest Night: Superman #3 (December 2009) After \\"Blackest Night\\" and the destruction of New Krypton, Superman set out to walk across America to re-establish a personal connection with the human race, feeling that he needed to remember what it was to be human after his time on New Krypton and the loss of his father. When talking about Superman's recent emotional upheaval during his walk, Batman speculates that part of the problem is that Clark never really experienced personal loss prior to Jonathan's death (Krypton's destruction having occurred when he was too young to have any emotional investment in it), although he is confident that his friend will come through recent events. Later on, Lex Luthor briefly acquires near-omnipotent power and attempts to drive Superman mad by forcing him to experience the human emotions he believed the alien merely faked in order to blend in with humanity, only to become outraged when his probing of his enemy's mind revealed that Superman's defining moment of tragedy was Jonathan's death, as he could not accept that his enemy was raised by humans or had such a good upbringing compared to his own anguished relationship with his father.Action Comics #900 =The New 52= In \\"The New 52\\" (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), both Jonathan and Martha Kent have died following an incident with a drunk driver and Clark Kent has to grow into his role as Superman without them. =DC Rebirth= In the mini-series Doomsday Clock, which follows and concludes the DC Rebirth relaunch, it is revealed that The New 52 was caused by Doctor Manhattan, who also caused the Kents' death.

Doctor Manhattan is eventually convinced by Superman to undo his actions: the former timeline is restored and the Kents are restored to life. This was depicted where Clark was inspired by the tales of the Justice Society where he became Superboy and prevented their deaths.Johns, Geoff (w); Grank, Gary (p). Doomsday Clock #12, December 2019, DC Comics (Burbank, California). Other versions The Kent's Earth-3 counterparts appear briefly in Forever Evil as part of Ultraman's origin. Young Jonathan and Martha Kent of Earth-Three are drug addicts in an abusive relationship. One day, while Jonathan is threatening Martha with a knife, Ultraman's space pod crash lands on their farm. Young Ultraman decides to blend into society until he is ready to conquer the planet, and forces Jonathan and Martha to act as his parents. It is revealed that sometime around the age of seven, Ultraman murders the Kents and burns down their farm, but keeps the name Clark Kent.Justice League vol. 2 #24 (October 2013) In the prequel to the video game Injustice: Gods Among Us, the President of the United States hires Mirror Master and a team of commandos to kidnap Jonathan and Martha to use them as bargaining chips in an attempt to end Superman's enforced peacekeeping. Superman and the Justice League successfully rescue them and Clark places them in the Fortress of Solitude to protect them after the government burned down Kent farm. When the Insurgency breaks into the Fortress to retrieve the super pill, Green Arrow accidentally hits Jonathon in the shoulder with one of his arrows when trying to combat Superman. Clark brutally beats Oliver to death, and Martha takes one of the pills to end his assault. The two confront their son over his unapologetic and dictatorial methods with Jor-El's hologram appearing and agreeing with the Kents that Clark has gone too far. As Superman ignores their pleads and flies out of the Fortress, the two apologize to Jor-El for failing to raise him properly while Jor-El apologizes to them for unleashing Kal-El onto this world. In the prequel to the game's sequel, the Kents still live in the Fortress of Solitude knowing they'd be persecuted for their son's actions if they returned to Smallville, with their farm having been burned down. When the heroes arrive to free the Teen Titans from the Phantom Zone, they allow all of them in except for Harley Quinn (due to her contribution to Superman's turn to villainy).

Consistent with the post-Crisis comics' version of his story, Jonathan is alive and active in the grown Clark's life, and remains dedicated to running his farm. The series portrayed Martha as a lively sixty-something, interested in creative and self- improving pursuits. The activities this version of Martha pursues include taking classes at the local university extension, trying yoga, and posing for a nude study by an artist friend, leading Jonathan to think she is having an affair. The clearest contrast between the couple is when they speak to Clark together on the telephone; Jonathan is seen using a land line with a corded receiver, while Martha uses a more modern cordless model. It is Martha who designs the Superman costume after a number of rejected prototypes (including ones that resemble the costumes of Captain America, Daredevil, and Green Lantern). When Superman is asked by the villain Tempus why a grown man like him would wear tights and a cape, Superman simply tells him \\"My mother made it for me\\". * In the 2000s television series Smallville, Annette O'Toole (who previously played Lana Lang in the film Superman III) and John Schneider play Martha and Jonathan Kent respectively. Unlike most adaptations, where they are depicted as elderly, this version of the Kents are in their early 40s upon the series' premiere.The second season episode \\"Suspect\\" reveals that Jonathan graduated from Smallville High School in 1976, fixing his date of birth around 1958 and making him approximately 43 years old when the series debuts in 2001. They were, at first, depicted as just Clark's parents, raising him and helping him cope with his powers, but soon became more fleshed out as they share a history with Lionel Luthor, whom Jonathan greatly despised since he had to convince Pete Ross' uncles to \\"sell\\" their cream corn factory in exchange for having Luthor forge Clark's adoption paperwork. Although Jonathan despises Lionel Luthor, the feelings did not appear to be mutually vindictive as Lionel had once told a kryptonite-addled Clark that he considered the Kents to be \\"hardworking, salt of the earth people\\" who could not possibly have a son trying to attack him, but this may also have been a way of Lionel trying to talk Clark out of attacking him, so as not to shame his adoptive parents. Martha began to develop feelings for Lionel as she worked for him as a personal assistant during a period when he was blinded after an accident, leading to some tensions in their marriage, but this attraction was always tempered by her knowledge of Lionel's past, although Lionel remained interested in Martha even after she left his employ when it was confirmed that he had regained his sight. Martha and Jonathan also almost had a child when Martha was cured by Clark's spaceship. However, she miscarried after Clark's attempt to destroy the ship, to stop Jor-El's consciousness forcing him to leave Smallville, triggered an explosion that struck the car where Martha was in. Clark briefly ran away to Metropolis under the influence of a red kryptonite ring to escape his guilt, but eventually returned after Jonathan convinced Jor-El to give him temporary Kryptonian powers so that he could convince Clark to remove the ring and face his guilt. The Kents stayed a strong couple up until the show's 100th episode, \\"Reckoning\\" in which Jonathan defeats Lex Luthor in the race to become a Kansas state senator. Jonathan later meets with Lionel, who tells him he knows Clark's secret. Jonathan attacks Lionel and subsequently suffers a heart attack and dies. Martha then takes over his role as senator, and grows closer to Lionel, although she never explores a romantic relationship with him. O'Toole's role on the show gradually shrinks, until she is written out in the sixth season finale \\"Phantom\\", in which Martha becomes the junior United States Senator from Kansas and relocates to Washington, D.C. permanently. Martha returned to Smallville in the season nine episode \\"Hostage\\", as the Red Queen, having used this new identity to protect Clark from those who conspire against him, and later in the season nine finale \\"Salvation\\", although not seen, she leaves Clark a box containing his trademark suit which is supposedly designed by Martha herself. Jonathan's spirit appears in the season ten premiere \\"Lazarus\\" to counsel his son on how he must confront the approaching darkness, and Clark encounters an alternate version of Jonathan in \\"Kent\\", when he returned to a parallel world where Clark was found by Lionel rather than the Kents. O'Toole and Schneider reprise their roles for the last time in the series finale, in which Jonathan is seen beside his wife at Clark's wedding to Lois Lane. Jonathan's spirit later appears to Clark at the Fortress of Solitude where he and Jor-El reminded Clark that the hero he will become has been shaped by his life in Smallville. * Martha Kent appears in the Titans episode \\"Connor\\" portrayed by Sarah Deakins. =Film=Animation * In the Superman theatrical cartoons from the '40s, the Kents are not mentioned as the finders of baby Kal-El's rocket. Instead, the unseen \\"passing motorist\\" of the origin story in Action Comics #1 is referred to as the person who finds the rocket and takes the baby to an orphanage. * In the Superman: Doomsday animated direct-to-video film, Martha is voiced by Swoosie Kurtz. In this film, Jonathan has been dead for many years. * In the Superman/Batman: Apocalypse animated direct-to-video film, both Jonathan and Martha appear devastated as they come home and see that their farm has been destroyed. In an attempt to calm them, Superman and Supergirl reassure them that they will build them another one. * Martha Kent appears in the direct-to-DVD animated film All-Star Superman (2011), voiced by Frances Conroy. Jonathan Kent's name appears in the tombstone when Superman lays a flower on his grave. * Frances Conroy later reprises her role of Martha in the direct-to-DVD animated feature Superman: Unbound (2013). * Mike Farrell and Shelley Fabares reprise their roles of Jonathan and Martha Kent in Superman: Brainiac Attacks. * Jonathan and Martha Kent appear in the animated film Superman vs The Elite (2012), with Jonathan voiced by Paul Eiding while Martha appears briefly with no dialogue. * Jonathan and Martha Kent appear in the animated film JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time (2014), with Jonathan voiced by Tom Gibis and Martha voiced by Erica Luttrell. * Jonathan and Martha Kent appear in the animated films The Death of Superman (2018) and Reign of the Supermen (2019), with Jonanthan voiced again by Paul Eiding and Martha voiced by Jennifer Hale. * Jonathan and Martha Kent appear in the animated film Superman: Man of Tomorrow (2020), with Jonanthan voiced again by Neil Flynn and Martha voiced by Bellamy Young. Live- action=Serials= * Edward Cassidy and Virginia Carroll play \\"Eben\\" and Martha Kent in the 1948 Superman movie serial starring Kirk Alyn. =Christopher Reeve/Brandon Routh series= Glenn Ford as Jonathan Kent with Phyllis Thaxter as Martha in Superman (1978). * Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter portray Jonathan and Martha in Superman: The Movie (1978). In the movie, they adopt Superman when they found him on the road. Then, while Jonathan tries to repair the car in which he and Martha are traveling, the car almost falls on him by mistake, but the young Superman holds it and saves him, to the surprise of the couple. Years later, as young Superman, named Clark by them, approaches manhood, after returning from school, decides to make a run with Jonathan to the barn, but while Clark arrives, Jonathan suffers of a heart attack and dies. Later, he's buried by Martha and Clark, reason for which the latter recognizes that even with his powers he could not have saved him. Later, Martha stays at the farm while Clark moves to Metropolis to work on the Daily Planet. * In Superman III (1983), it is mentioned by Lana Lang that Martha has passed away in Smallville at some unspecified point. * In Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), Superman returns to Smallville and subsequent scenes revolve around Clark's decision to sell the family farm to a customer. * In the film Superman Returns (2006), Academy Award winner Eva Marie Saint portrays Martha Kent. Because the film is a semi-sequel to the 1978 film and Superman II (1980), this version could be considered similar to Phyllis Thaxter's portrayal but with differences included: in the 1978 film, Martha Kent appeared physically frail and nearly-homebound, while in Superman Returns she is much more active, driving a stick-shift truck and helping to lift her 200-pound son out of the smoking wreckage of his space ship. Photos of Jonathan Kent (as played by Glenn Ford) are briefly visible in Martha's living room. In this film, when Clark comes back after an absence of five years, she may have already been dating Ben Hubbard but the storyline was cut from the final film. =DC Extended Universe= Kevin Costner and Diane Lane portray Johnathan and Martha Kent in the DC Extended Universe, making their debut in the 2013 film Man of Steel. * In Man of Steel, Jonathan is concerned with ensuring Clark's powers remain a secret until the world is ready to accept him for who he really is and Clark is ready to handle the weight of the world's attention. To that end, Jonathan is deeply conflicted upon learning that Clark used his powers to save his classmates and driver during a school bus crash into the river. Jonathan even assists Pete Ross in protecting Clark when Kenny Braverman and his friends pick on him. Tension also develops between Jonathan and a young adult Clark. When Clark expresses his desire to go out into the world and use his powers to make a difference, Jonathan counters that farming is also a useful endeavor and believes Clark should remain. Jonathan Kent dies in a tornado that strikes Smallville when he refuses to allow Clark to help rescue the Kent family's dog Hank to protect the secret. For her part, Martha helped Clark to control his super-senses when they were overwhelming him as a child, and refused to give up anything concerning her son to General Zod. Martha is saved only by the timely arrival of Superman, enraged at his adoptive mother being threatened. * In Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Clark begins questioning his actions as Superman leading him to the Kent farm where Martha gives him telling them he can be whoever he wants and does not owe the people a thing. On a mountain, Clark has a vision of Jonathan who persuades him not to give up on helping people. Using his knowledge of Superman's secret identity, Lex Luthor has Martha kidnapped and held hostage by Anatoli Knyazev in order to have Superman fight Batman. When Superman asks Batman to \\"Save Martha\\" during their fight, echoing his father's dying word \\"Martha\\" (in reference to his wife, Bruce's mother, Martha Wayne), this reminder of Bruce's father drives Batman to realize he has recreated his own parents' death, taking the place of the killer. Batman departs to rescue Martha from the warehouse she's held in. After Clark is killed, a private ceremony is held on Kent farm in which she gives Lois an engagement ring from Clark and has his body buried next to Jonathan's grave. * In Justice League, Martha's close to selling the Kent farm as she can't afford the bank's fees and she no longer has an attachment to Smallville following her son's death. When Superman is resurrected, she joyously reunites with Clark at the farm. At the end of the film, Bruce buys the bank Martha owed money to, allowing her to keep the farm. =Video games= * Jonathan and Martha Kent appear in DC Universe Online, voiced by Brandon Young and Diane Perella. They appear as supporting characters for the heroes. In the \\"Smallville Alert\\", Jonathan Kent is among the Smallville citizens who get turned into clones of Doomsday and the players have to regress him back to normal.

Climate commitment studies attempt to assess the amount of future global warming that is \\"committed\\" under the assumption of some constant level of forcings. The constant level often used for illustrative purposes is doubling or quadrupling; or the present level of forcing.  Basic idea  If a perturbation ‚Äî such as an increase in greenhouse gases or solar activity ‚Äî is applied to the climate system the response will not be immediate, principally because of the large heat capacity (i.e., thermal inertia) of the oceans. :As an analogue, consider the heating of a thin metal plate (by the sun or by a flame): the plate will warm relatively quickly. If a thick metal block is heated instead, it will take much longer for the entire block to reach equilibrium with the imposed heating because of its higher heat capacity. Land only stores heat in the top few meters. Ocean water, by contrast, can move vertically and store heat within the ocean's depth (convection). This is why the land surface is observed to warm more than the oceans. It also explains the very large difference in response between * \\"equilibrium\\" climate prediction runs in which only a shallow ocean is used and it is assumed that the climate has come to equilibrium and * \\"transient\\" climate prediction runs in which a full ocean is used and the climate is out of balance. The \\"commitment\\" can apply to variables other than temperature: because of the long mixing time for heat into the deep ocean, a given surface warming commits to centuries of sea level rise from thermal expansion of the ocean. Also once a certain threshold is crossed, it is likely that a slow melting of the Greenland ice sheet will commit us to a sea level rise of 5m over millennia.  Models  Recent models forecast that even in the unlikely event of greenhouse gases stabilizing at present levels, the earth would warm by an additional 0.5¬∞C by 2100, a similar rise in temperature to that seen during the 20th century. In 2050, as much as 64% of that commitment would be due to past natural forcings. Over time, their contribution compared to the human influence will diminish. Overall, the warming commitment at 2005 greenhouse gas levels could exceed 1¬∞C. As ocean waters expand in response to this warming, global sea levels would mount by about 10 centimeters during that time. These models do not take into account ice cap and glacier melting; including those climate feedback effects would give a 1‚Äì1.5¬∞C estimated temperature increase. History The concept has been discussed as far back as 1995 in the IPCC TAR and in the SAR.

It was named for the \\"butterfly\\" multi-stage switching network around which it was built. Each machine had up to 512 CPUs, each with local memory, which could be connected to allow every CPU access to every other CPU's memory, although with a substantially greater latency (roughly 15:1) than for its own. The CPUs were commodity microprocessors. The memory address space was shared. The first generation used Motorola 68000 processors, followed by a 68010 version. The Butterfly connect was developed specifically for this computer. The second or third generation, GP-1000 models used Motorola 68020's and scaled to 256 CPUs. The later, TC-2000 models used Motorola MC88100's, and scaled to 512 CPUs. The Butterfly was initially developed as the Voice Funnel, a router for the ST-II protocol intended for carrying voice and video over IP networks. The Butterfly hardware was later used for the Butterfly Satellite IMP (BSAT) packet switch of DARPA's Wideband Packet Satellite Network which operated at multiple sites around the US over a shared 3 Mbit/s broadcast satellite channel. In the late 1980s, this network became the Terrestrial Wideband Network, based on terrestrial T1 circuits instead of a shared broadcast satellite channel and the BSAT became the Wideband Packet Switch (WPS). Another DARPA sponsored project at BBN produced the Butterfly Multiprocessor Internet Gateway (Internet Router) to interconnect different types of networks at the IP layer. Like the BSAT, the Butterfly Gateway broke the contention of a shared bus minicomputer architecture that had been in use for Internet Gateways by combining the routing computations and I/O at the network interfaces and using the Butterfly's switch fabric to provide the network interconnections. This resulted in significantly higher link throughputs. The Butterfly began with a proprietary operating system called Chrysalis, but moved to a Mach kernel operating system in 1989. While the memory access time was non-uniform, the machine had SMP memory semantics, and could be operated as a symmetric multiprocessor. http://www.new- npac.org/projects/cdroms/cewes-1999-06-vol1/nhse/hpccsurvey/orgs/bbn/bbn The largest configured system with 128 processors was at the University of Rochester Computer Science Department. Most delivered systems had about 16 processors. No known configurations appear to be in museums. At least one system is thought to be sitting within a DARPA autonomous vehicle. TotalView, the parallel program debugger developed for the Butterfly, outlived the platform and was ported to a number of other massively parallel machines.

Alkenes and alkynes form organic compounds in which the multiple carbon‚Äìcarbon bond has been replaced by a carbonyl group while azo compounds form nitrosamines. The outcome of the reaction depends on the type of multiple bond being oxidized and the work-up conditions. Ozonolysis of alkenes Alkenes can be oxidized with ozone to form alcohols, aldehydes or ketones, or carboxylic acids. In a typical procedure, ozone is bubbled through a solution of the alkene in methanol at ‚àí78 ¬∞C until the solution takes on a characteristic blue color, which is due to unreacted ozone. This indicates complete consumption of the alkene. Alternatively, various other chemicals can be used as indicators of this endpoint by detecting the presence of ozone. If ozonolysis is performed by bubbling a stream of ozone-enriched oxygen through the reaction mixture, the gas that bubbles out can be directed through a potassium iodide solution. When the solution has stopped absorbing ozone, the ozone in the bubbles oxidizes the iodide to iodine, which can easily be observed by its violet color. For closer control of the reaction itself, an indicator such as Sudan Red III can be added to the reaction mixture. Ozone reacts with this indicator more slowly than with the intended ozonolysis target. The ozonolysis of the indicator, which causes a noticeable color change, only occurs once the desired target has been consumed. If the substrate has two alkenes that react with ozone at different rates, one can choose an indicator whose own oxidation rate is intermediate between them, and therefore stop the reaction when only the most susceptible alkene in the substrate has reacted. Otherwise, the presence of unreacted ozone in solution (seeing its blue color) or in the bubbles (via iodide detection) only indicates when all alkenes have reacted. After completing the addition, a reagent is then added to convert the intermediate ozonide to a carbonyl derivative. Reductive work-up conditions are far more commonly used than oxidative conditions. The use of triphenylphosphine, thiourea, zinc dust, or dimethyl sulfide produces aldehydes or ketones while the use of sodium borohydride produces alcohols. The use of hydrogen peroxide produces carboxylic acids. Recently, the use of amine N-oxides has been reported to produce aldehydes directly. Other functional groups, such as benzyl ethers, can also be oxidized by ozone. It has been proposed that small amounts of acid may be generated during the reaction from oxidation of the solvent, so pyridine is sometimes used to buffer the reaction. Dichloromethane is often used as a 1:1 cosolvent to facilitate timely cleavage of the ozonide. Azelaic acid and pelargonic acids are produced from ozonolysis of oleic acid on an industrial scale. :A generalized scheme of ozonolysis An example is the ozonolysis of eugenol converting the terminal alkene to an aldehyde: :Eugenol ozonolysis By controlling the reaction/workup conditions, unsymmetrical products can be generated from symmetrical alkenes: * Using TsOH; sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3); dimethyl sulfide (DMS) gives an aldehyde and a dimethyl acetal * Using acetic anhydride (Ac2O), triethylamine (Et3N) gives a methyl ester and an aldehyde * Using TsOH; Ac2O, Et3N, gives a methyl ester and a dimethyl acetal. =Reaction mechanism= Carbonyl oxide (Criegee zwitterion) In the generally accepted mechanism proposed by Rudolf Criegee in 1953, the alkene and ozone form an intermediate molozonide in a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. Next, the molozonide reverts to its corresponding carbonyl oxide (also called the Criegee intermediate or Criegee zwitterion) and aldehyde or ketone in a retro-1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. The oxide and aldehyde or ketone react again in a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition or produce a relatively stable ozonide intermediate (a trioxolane). :The reaction mechanism of ozonolysis. Evidence for this mechanism is found in isotopic labeling. When 17O-labelled benzaldehyde reacts with carbonyl oxides, the label ends up exclusively in the ether linkage of the ozonide. There is still dispute over whether the molozonide collapses via a concerted or radical process; this may also exhibit a substrate dependence. =History= Ozonolysis was invented by Christian Friedrich Sch√∂nbein in 1840. Before the advent of modern spectroscopic techniques, it was an important method for determining the structure of organic molecules. Chemists would ozonize an unknown alkene to yield smaller and more readily identifiable fragments. The ozonolysis of alkenes is sometimes referred to as \\"Harries ozonolysis\\", because some attribute this reaction to Carl Dietrich Harries. Ozonolysis of alkynes Ozonolysis of alkynes generally gives an acid anhydride or diketone product, not complete fragmentation as for alkenes. A reducing agent is not needed for these reactions. The exact mechanism is not completely known. If the reaction is performed in the presence of water, the anhydride hydrolyzes to give two carboxylic acids. :450px Ozonolysis of other substrates Ozonolysis of oleic acid is an important route to azelaic acid. The coproduct is nonanoic acid: :H17C8CH=CHC7H14CO2H \\\\+ 4\\"O\\" ‚Üí HO2CC7H14CO2H \\\\+ H17C8CO2H Ozonolysis of elastomers The method was used to confirm the structural repeat unit in natural rubber as isoprene. It is also a serious problem, known as \\"ozone cracking\\" where traces of the gas in an atmosphere will cut double bonds in susceptible elastomers, including natural rubber, polybutadiene, Styrene- butadiene and Nitrile rubber. Ozone cracking creates small cracks at right angles to the load in the surfaces exposed to the gas, the cracks growing steadily as attack continues. The rubber product must be under tension for crack growth to occur. Ozone cracking in Natural rubber tubing Ozone cracking is a form of stress corrosion cracking where active chemical species attack products of a susceptible material. Ozone cracking was once commonly seen in the sidewalls of tires but is now rare owing to the use of antiozonants. Other means of prevention include replacing susceptible rubbers with resistant elastomers such as polychloroprene, EPDM or Viton.

In 1781, he was made a Knight in the Order of Saint Louis. Joining the ship R√©solution in 1785, Kermadec was second in command to Bruni d'Entrecasteaux on an voyage to China. He commanded his own ship, the Rh√¥ne in 1789 and later that year joined the Acad√©mie de Marine. From 1790 to 1791, he captained Patriote, part of the squadron under d'Entrecasteaux. In September 1791 he was chosen to command the Esp√©rance on d'Entrecasteaux's expedition to find the lost ships of Jean-Fran√ßois de La P√©rouse. Kermandec supervised the preparations for the vessels selected for the expedition, his own Esp√©rance and d'Entrecasteaux's Recherche. Departing from Brest, Kermadec received a promotion to Captain on 29 September 1791. The expedition explored Tasmania, New Caledonia, New Guinea and the Santa Cruz Islands without finding any trace of La Perouse, before returning to Tasmania in January 1793. The expedition then sailed for Tonga and onto New Caledonia, where Kermadec died of tuberculosis on 6 May 1793 at Balade. He was discreetly buried on Poudiou√©, a nearby islet, to prevent the natives from tampering with the body. Legacy The Kermadec Islands northeast of New Zealand are named for Huon de Kermadec, as are the Kermadec Trench, Kermandie, and the Kermandie River, both in Tasmania, Huonville, the Huon Valley, Huon River also all in Tasmania, and the Huon Peninsula and Huon Gulf of Papua New Guinea. Several plants also bear his name, including the Huon Pine (Lagarostrobos franklinii) of Tasmania, the Proteaceae genus Kermadecia of New Caledonia, and the tree Metrosideros kermadecensis of the Kermadec Islands.

It was established on December 31, 1928 by Reuben Schwartz, a Jewish immigrant from Romania. Its long popularity and reputation has led to it being considered a cultural institution of Montreal. The staff of Schwartz's credits the unique flavour of their smoked meat to their mandatory 10-day meat curing time, the high turnover of their meat, and their brick smoke-house covered with over 80 years' worth of buildup. Offerings Schwartz's smoked meat =Smoked meat= Schwartz's signature dish is a smoked meat sandwich served on rye bread with yellow mustard. The meat is served by the fat content: lean, medium, medium-fat or fat. Medium and medium-fat are the most popular. According to journalist Bill Brownstein, the classic Schwartz's meal includes a medium-fat sandwich, fries, half-sour pickle, coleslaw, red pepper, and a black cherry soda. Bens, a Montreal competitor, had a longstanding and widely believed advertising slogan that claimed the restaurant had invented smoked meat, but this has been debunked by cultural historians.Note: \\"Old Man Kravitz, a shameless self-promoter ... Throughout the years Ben claimed that he introduced the smoked meat sandwich to Montreal. But it is a well-known fact that the British-American Delicatessen Store had been dispensing quality smoked meat sandwiches for a period of four years prior to the establishment of Fanny's Fruit and Candy Store. Old Man Kravitz also implied that he introduced smoked meat to Montreal, but we know that is a pile of baloney\\". Eiran Harris, Montreal-Style Smoked Meat: An interview with Eiran Harris conducted by Lara Rabinovitch, with the cooperation of the Jewish Public Library Archives of Montreal, Cuizine: The Journal of Canadian Food Cultures: Volume 1, num√©ro 2, 2009. =Montreal steak seasoning= Schwartz's is also credited with creating Montreal steak seasoning or Montreal steak spice when Morris \\"The Shadow\\" Sherman, a broilerman working at Schwartz's in the 1940s and '50s, began adding the deli-smoked meat pickling spices to his own rib and liver steaks. It was so popular that it was copied by other Montreal delis and steakhouses. History People lined up out the door The deli has passed through several owners since its foundation: #Reuben Schwartz (1928‚Äì1971): Founded the \\"Montreal Hebrew Delicatessen\\" in 1928. Reuben Schwartz was described by many as a bad businessman and a supposedly nasty character (boozer, gambler, womanizer) whose family could not stand him. #Maurice Zbriger (1971‚Äì1981): A violinist and composer, Zbriger was eventually made a partner, and eventually, sole owner of Schwartz's, until his death in 1981. He took Reuben Schwartz into his home and created him 'manager for life.' Zbriger made Schwartz's a great success, and with the profits from the business, Zbriger spent many thousands of dollars organizing free concerts of his music. His story was documented in the National Film Board of Canada production The Concert Man. #Armande Toupin Chartrand (1981‚Äì1999): She began as a professional organizer and caretaker to Maurice Zbriger and through her service to him she was willed the delicatessen. #Hy Diamond (1999‚Äì2012): The only owner who has had a business background; for many years he was its accountant. #The Nakis and Ang√©lil-Dion family (2012‚Äìpresent): The current owners of Schwartz's. A partnership consisting of Paul Nakis (involved in the Baton Rouge Restaurant chain among others); his granddaughter Anastasia; the late Ren√© Ang√©lil with his then-wife Celine Dion; and Eric and Martin Sara (sons of Paul Sara, former owner, along with Ang√©lil, of Nickels restaurant chain). Prior to the purchase, Dion and Ang√©lil used to favor the Main Deli Steak House over Schwartz's. Schwartz's is one of the six original Montreal delicatessen restaurants, the other five being Bens De Luxe Delicatessen & Restaurant (closed in 2006), Main Deli Steak House, Lester‚Äôs Deli, Dunn‚Äôs Famous Deli, and the Snowdon Deli. When the Charter of the French Language became law in 1977, the sign outside changed from \\"Hebrew delicatessen\\" to \\"charcuterie H√©bra√Øque\\". Potential expansion Interior view Several restaurateurs have offered to build Schwartz's as franchise operations in cities across North America, to which the owners have always refused. The idea of franchising Schwartz's just in Montreal has also been rejected due to customer opposition. In the fall of 2008, Schwartz's opened a take-out location next door. On 5 March 2012, the Nakis and Angelil-Dion families purchased Schwartz's, reportedly for $10 million. The new owners could franchise Schwartz's; however, they stated they have no intention of doing so. On 28 February 2013, Schwartz's began using their trademark name on vacuum sealed pouches of smoked meat sold at IGA supermarkets in Quebec. This mass- produced (factory made) smoked meat product has since become available in other supermarkets across Canada. In media In 2006, Montreal Gazette columnist Bill Brownstein wrote the book Schwartz's Hebrew Delicatessen: The Story, published by V√©hicule Press. Schwartz's has also been the subject of numerous articles in Canadian and international publications. It has also been the inspiration for a theatre production about the deli: Schwartz's: The Musical. The restaurant has been the subject of two documentary films: The Concert Man by Tony Ianzelo and Chez Schwartz by Garry Beitel.Official site of the \\"Chez Schwartz\\" movie See also * Bens De Luxe Delicatessen & Restaurant * Fairmount Bagel * Historic Jewish Quarter, Montreal * List of delicatessens * Main Deli Steak House ReferencesFurther reading * External links * Category:1928 establishments in Quebec Category:Celine Dion Category:Jewish Canadian cuisine Category:Jewish delicatessens Category:Jews and Judaism in Montreal Category:Kosher style restaurants Category:Landmarks in Montreal Category:Le Plateau-Mont-Royal Category:Montreal cuisine Category:Restaurants established in 1928 Category:Restaurants in Montreal Category:Romanian-Canadian history Category:Romanian-Jewish culture in Canada ","title":"Schwartz's"},{"id":"1624193","text":"Gee!

It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Liverpool, the archdeaconry of Liverpool, and the deanery of Toxteth and Wavertree. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The church was built in 1868‚Äì69 and designed by G. E. Street. It was paid for by Robert Horsfall, a local stockbroker and Anglo-Catholic. The church became \\"the centre of Anglo- Catholicism in 19th-century Liverpool\\". In 1924‚Äì26 the Jesus Chapel, designed by Hubert B. Adderley, was added to the north of the church. The architectural style of the church is Decorated. ArchitectureExterior= St Margaret's is constructed in common brick, with dressings in red brick and stone, and has a slate roof. Its plan consists of a nave and chancel forming a single vessel, the nave being flanked by aisles. There is no clerestory. On the roof, at the division of the nave and chancel, is a timber bellcote. In the central part of the west end of the church are two three-light windows, with a buttress between them and on each side. Above the central buttress is a canopied niche containing a statue of St Margaret of Antioch. Over this is a rose window. To the sides of the central part are the aisles under lean-to roofs; each has a doorway with a rose window above. A passage leads from the north side of the church to the vicarage. =Interior= Inside the church are six-bay arcades carried on marble piers with bands of alternating colours. The chancel is at a higher level, and is separated from the nave by a low marble wall with central iron gates. In the chancel are a piscina and a sedilia. On the north side of the chancel is a two-bay arcade leading to the Jesus Chapel. The font is circular, carried on six columns, and stands on a hexagonal base. The pulpit is in gilded wood, and is decorated with busts of saints. In the chancel floor is a brass to Robert Horsfall. There is much painted decoration on the walls, most of it by Maddox and Pearce. Much of the stained glass is by Clayton and Bell. The glass in the west window of the south aisle is by Percy Bacon Brothers. At the east end of the church are two windows, replaced after the Second World War, which were designed by Gerald E. R. Smith and H. L. Pawle, and made in the A. K. Nicholson Studio. In the Jesus chapel is an ornate polychrome reredos. The two-manual pipe organ was made in 1869 by Henry Willis.

Most of the stanzas were written by Charles Wesley, and the hymn appeared under the title \\"Hymn for Easter Day\\" in Hymns and Sacred Poems by Charles and John Wesley in 1739. The hymn eventually became well known for the \\"Alleluia\\" sung as a melisma after each line, which was added by an unknown author, probably to fit the commonly used hymn tune of \\"Easter hymn\\". It remains a traditional processional hymn on Easter Sunday.  History  Charles Wesley, the co-founder of the Methodist Church, wrote \\"Christ the Lord Is Risen Today\\" in 1739 where it was initially titled \\"Hymn for Easter Day\\". He based it on an older anonymous Bohemian hymn titled \\"Jesus Christ is Risen Today\\". The new hymn was first performed at the first service at The Foundery Meeting House after Wesley had adapted it into the first Methodist chapel. Following this, Wesley published it in the Hymns and Sacred Poems hymnal. It was initially written with eleven verses of four lines each. It was also published in A Collection of Hymns for the Use of the People called Methodists hymnal. The hymn was later edited by Martin Madan for inclusion in his Psalms and Hymns hymnal by removing the seventh, eighth and ninth verses. The hymn eventually became popular in the Church of England from around 1780. Charles Welsey's brother, John Wesley excluded it from the Wesleyan Methodist Church's Wesleyan Hymn Book, which John did to preclude the inclusion of any specific seasonal hymns. It was not until 1831, when the Supplement to the Collection was published by an unknown Methodist, that \\"Christ the Lord is Risen Today\\" made it into the hymnals of the Methodist Church regularly. Prior to this hymn being published, church music had maintained a similar style of dynamics to music and chants from the Biblical period. \\"Christ the Lord Is Risen Today\\" was written as a more uplifting style of worship expressing personal feelings to God that eventually became the bedrock of Christian music into the modern era. The composition of \\"Christ the Lord Is Risen Today\\" originally consisted of eleven verses of four lines, which were later reduced to six, and early in the 19th century \\"Alleluia\\" was added to the end of each line. This results in \\"Alleluia\\" appearing twenty-four times in the hymn. It is not known why this was done, but it is speculated by hymn analysts that it was to ensure that the hymn fit the tune of \\"Easter Hymn\\". The hymn led to a more popular awareness of Alleluia being used for Easter to celebrate the Resurrection of Jesus. The Methodist historian Bernard Lord Manning said about it: > But in the evening at the chapel, though I was uncertain about the prayers, > there was no gamble about the hymns. I knew we should have Charles Wesley's > Easter hymn, \\"Christ the Lord Is Risen Today,\\" with its 24 \\"Alleluias\\": and > we did have it. Among any Dissenters worth the name that hymn is as certain > to come on Easter Day as the Easter Collect in the Established Church (the > Church of England). And mark this further‚Äîthose 24 \\"Alleluias\\" are not there > for nothing: the special use of \\"Alleluia\\" at Easter comes down to us from > the most venerable liturgies. Our hymns are our liturgy, an excellent > liturgy. Let us study it, respect it, use it, develop it, and boast of it. \\"Christ the Lord Is Risen Today\\" has been considered by many Christian hymnologists such as William Studwell, as being the most definitive church anthem for Easter. It is an example where Roman Catholics and Anglicans cease using the word \\"Alleluia\\" during the period of Lent but restore it into their services on Easter Sunday. Charles Wesley Beyond Methodism and Anglicanism, \\"Christ the Lord Is Risen Today\\" has been adopted by other Christian denominations; Baptists have adopted the hymn. Likewise, Presbyterians have been using the hymn since at least the 19th century where it was also included in hymnals used for missionary work in the colonies of the British Empire. The hymn is also used by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. However they only use three verses of the hymn and have an altered text for them. The hymn is a variation of an earlier hymn \\"Jesus Christ Is Risen Today\\", a 14th- century Latin hymn which had been translated into English and published in Lyra Davidica in 1708 (and later in 1749 in Arnold's Compleat Psalmodist). In some hymnals, Jesus Christ Is Risen Today is in fact the three-stanza Compleat Psalmodist version with one or more of the additional stanzas written by Wesley appended. Though \\"Christ the Lord Is Risen Today\\" gained early popularity from within the Church of England, over time the Anglicans' preference moved towards \\"Jesus Christ Is Risen Today\\" and away from Wesley's hymn.  Text  Each verse of \\"Christ the Lord Is Risen Today\\" features a focus on the Resurrection of Jesus. For the final verse, Wesley uses descriptive language to describe four requirements for Christians to enjoy eternal life with God. The focusses are for Christians: to know God, to bear witness to God, to sing their faith and to love one another. The lyrics of \\"Christ the Lord Is Risen Today\\" draw inspiration from a number of Biblical texts. The overall focus of the hymn is drawn from Matthew 28:5‚Äì6 where Mary Magdalene and the other Mary is told by an angel of Jesus' resurrection. The wording as well as the \\"Alleluias\\" are drawn from the Book of Psalms with a number of Psalms being used including Psalms 106, 111, 112, 113, 117 and 135. It also alludes to Revelation 19 where it is said that during the Rapture that \\"Alleluia\\" will sing out from Heaven. In 1989, the United Methodist Church's United Methodist Hymnal altered the second line of the first verse from \\"Sons of men and angels say\\" to \\"Earth and Heaven in chorus say\\". The change was one of many gender-neutralizing lyrical alterations the hymnal made in a professed effort to make the hymns more inclusive. This altered version has since been adopted by some other Christian denominations.  Tune  There are two tunes commonly used for \\"Christ the Lord Is Risen Today\\", these are \\"Easter Hymn\\" and \\"Llanfair\\". \\"Easter Hymn\\" is the most used tune for the hymn. Easter Hymn was originally titled \\"The Resurrection\\" and published anonymously in Lyra Davidica in 1708. Despite being anonymous, over time it has been misattributed to J. W. Worgan, Henry Carey and George Frederick Handel. The writer James T. Lightwood said of it: \\"there is probably no tune in Christendom so universally sung on any festal day as the Easter hymn, with its rolling \\"Hallelujah\\", on Easter morning.\\" \\"Christ the Lord Is Risen Today\\" also gained popularity as a children's hymn by editors of children's hymnals. This was attributed to the \\"Easter Hymn\\" tune being easy to learn despite the complex language within the text. Llanfair was written by Robert Williams in Llanfairpwllgwyngyll, Anglesey, Wales and the tune was named after the town. This hymn tune was also harmonised by the Director of Music of University College, Oxford, David Evans. Other hymn tunes used for \\"Christ the Lord Is Risen Today\\" are \\"Orientis Partibus\\", \\"Savannah,\\" and \\"Resurrexit\\". One of these could potentially have been the original tune when it was first performed by Wesley, but this is unknown. British composer John Rutter published a choral arrangement of the \\"Christ The Lord Is Risen Today\\", using the Easter Hymn tune, in 2016. Also NCC Worship, working with Integrity Music, composed a modern tune to accompany the hymn.

Highly regarded and often performed in Ireland, it was first staged at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin in 1924. It is set in the working-class tenements of Dublin in the early 1920s, during the Irish Civil War period. It is the second of his \\"Dublin Trilogy\\" ‚Äì the other two being The Shadow of a Gunman (1923) and The Plough and the Stars (1926). PlotAct I= Juno and the Paycock takes place in the tenements of Dublin in 1922, just after the outbreak of the Irish Civil War, and revolves around the misfortunes of the dysfunctional Boyle family. The father, \\"Captain\\" Jack (so called because of his propensity for telling greatly exaggerated stories of his short career as a merchant seaman), is a loafer who claims to be unable to work because of pains in his legs, which mysteriously appear whenever someone mentions work. Despite his family's poverty, Jack spends all his time and money at the pub with Joxer Daly, his ne'er-do-well \\"butty,\\" instead of looking for a job. The mother, Juno (so called because all of the important events in her life took place in June), is the only member of the family currently working, as daughter Mary is on strike and son Johnny is disabled, having lost his arm in the War of Independence. Mary feels guilty about dumping her boyfriend and fellow striker, Jerry Devine, who feels more strongly for her than she does for him. Meanwhile, Johnny agonises over his betrayal of his friend Robbie Tancred, a neighbour and former comrade in the IRA, who was subsequently murdered by Free State supporters; Johnny is terrified that the IRA will execute him as punishment for being an informant. Near the end of the act, one of Jack's relatives dies, and a schoolteacher, Charles Bentham, brings news that the Boyles have come into a large inheritance; Bentham notes aloud that the will names \\"John Boyle, [my] first cousin, of Dublin\\" as one of the beneficiaries. Overjoyed with the news, Jack vows to Juno to end his friendship with Joxer and change his ways. =Act II= A mere two days after receiving Mr Bentham's news, Jack has already begun flaunting his newfound wealth by purchasing a new suit, new furniture, a gramophone, and other luxuries on credit, in anticipation of receiving the inheritance. The Boyles throw a party and invite Bentham, who is courting Mary. Joxer is present, Jack having already forgotten his vow to break off contact with him, and Mrs Maisie Madigan, a neighbour to whom Jack owes money, shows up after having been invited in Act I. During the party, Robbie Tancred's funeral procession passes the tenement, but the Boyles and their guests halt their carousing only when Tancred's grieving mother stops at their door. Juno goes out to offer support to Mrs Tancred, who delivers a monologue mourning the loss of her son and praying for an end to the war, but Jack selfishly ignores her suffering. =Act III= Two months later, Bentham abruptly ceases all contact with the family and abandons Mary, who, it is revealed, is secretly carrying his child out of wedlock. While Jack is sleeping, Juno takes Mary to the doctor. Soon after they leave, Needle Nugent, the local tailor, storms into the flat and repossesses Jack's suit. Then Mrs Madigan arrives, demanding repayment of the loan she gave Jack; when he refuses to pay, she takes the gramophone as recompense. Joxer (who was present for both incidents, and did nothing to help) needles Jack about rumours that the inheritance is not forthcoming; this soon devolves into an argument during which Joxer openly mocks Jack's fortune as fraudulent. While Johnny upbraids his father for embarrassing the family, Juno returns alone and delivers the news of Mary's pregnancy. As Juno pleads with Jack to use the leftover money from the inheritance to move the family to a different city, he angrily reveals that they will receive nothing due to an error Bentham made while drafting the will (he failed to include the beneficiaries' names, referring to Jack only as \\"[my] first cousin\\"). As a result, numerous relations are claiming the inheritance, which is rapidly being eaten up by legal costs; to make matters worse, Bentham has apparently fled the country out of shame. Johnny berates his father for his shortsightedness and avarice. Unable to cope with the stress of the situation, Jack disowns Mary and retreats to the pub to drink with Joxer. Johnny persuades Juno to follow Jack and beg him to come home. Mary returns, and Johnny disowns her as well. Jerry Devine shows up to patch things up with Mary, but he too renounces her when he learns of her pregnancy. As the last of Jack's fancy new furniture is being repossessed, several IRA men arrive and drag Johnny away; Juno later hears from Mrs Madigan that a body resembling Johnny's has been found on a country road, riddled with bullets. Juno decides that Jack will never take on his responsibilities as a father and breadwinner, so she leaves to make a better life for herself and Mary. She sends Mary to live with a relative and, before going to the police station to identify Johnny's body, delivers a monologue that echoes Mrs Tancred's in Act II. Some time later, Jack stumbles home from the pub with Joxer, extremely drunk and unaware that his son is dead or that his wife and daughter have left him. After a brief conversation, Jack accidentally drops his last sixpence on the floor; he drunkenly mourns that \\"the whole world is in a terrible state o' chassis\\" before passing out.

Founded in 1965, the museum holds the world's largest permanent exhibit on African-American culture. In 1997, Detroit architects Sims-Varner & Associates (now SDG Associates) designed a new 120,000 square foot (11,000 m2) facility on Warren Avenue, the museum's current location.About the Museum The Wright Museum is a nonprofit institution and has dual missions, serving as both a museum of artifacts and a place of cultural retention and growth. A wall of the museum has the museum's official poem, written by Melba Boyd, inscribed in bronze.Melba J. Boyd - Distinguished Professor & Chair . Wayne State University. Retrieved May 6, 2015. The Museum owns more than 35,000 artifacts and archival materials. Some of the major collections it is home to include the Blanche Coggin Underground Railroad Collection, the Harriet Tubman Museum Collection, a Coleman A. Young Collection and a collection of documents about the labor movement in Detroit called the Sheffield Collection. Also in the museum is an interactive exhibit called And Still We Rise: Our Journey through African American History and Culture, seven exhibition areas devoted to African Americans and their lives, the Louise Lovett Wright Research Library, and the General Motors Theater, which is a 317-seat facility for film, live performances, lectures, and presentations.

In August, the museum hosts the African World Festival, a free, three-day festival celebrating the culture of the African diaspora. History Charles H. Wright, a practicing gynecologist, was inspired to create an institution to preserve African- American history after he visited a memorial to Danish World War II heroes in Denmark. In 1965, Dr. Charles H. Wright opened the International Afro-American Museum on 1549 West Grand Boulevard in a house he owned. Some of the exhibits included the inventions of Michigander Elijah McCoy, and masks from Nigeria and Ghana that he had acquired while visiting there. The next year, he opened a traveling exhibit to tour the state. In 1978, the city of Detroit leased the museum a plot of land in Midtown near the Detroit Public Library, the Detroit Institute of Art, and the Detroit Science Center. Groundbreaking for a new museum occurred in 1985, and the museum was renamed the Museum of African American History.

It is on the A509 road between Enniskillen and the border with County Cavan (the N3 road to Dublin). It had a population of 624 in the 2011 census and is situated within Fermanagh and Omagh district. History The village has several historical features, including the Callowhill graveyard with headstones dating back to the 17th century. Upper Lough Erne is east of the village, and west is the peak of Slieve Rushen. To the northeast is the limestone hill known as Knockninny Rock (from which the Catholic parish and the Civil Barony takes its name). =Corratrasna Castle= On the southern slope of Knockninny Hill, about a mile north of Derrylin village, can be seen the ruins of Corratrasna Castle (or Corratrasna House), a relatively small fortified house that was probably built around 1611, at the start of the Plantation of Ulster.Rowan, Alistair, The Buildings of Ireland: North West Ulster (popularly known as the Pevsner Guide to North West Ulster), pps 226-227. Yale, London, 2003.Wilsdon, Bill, Plantation Castles on the Erne, pps 166-168. The History Press Ireland, Dublin, 2010. The 'castle' was probably built for a branch of the Balfour family, a Scottish settler family who were based at Castle Balfour in nearby Lisnaskea.Rowan, Alistair, The Buildings of Ireland: North West Ulster, p. 226. Yale, London, 2003. However, there is a local tradition that claims the 'castle' was built around 1611 for Brian Maguire, a member of the Clan Mac Uidhir (or Maguire dynasty), Gaelic Lords of Fermanagh.Wilsdon, Bill, Plantation Castles on the Erne, p. 166. The History Press Ireland, Dublin, 2010. Another local tradition, recorded by the Irish Office of the Ordnance Survey in the 1830s, states that the 'castle' may have been built for Dr William Bedell, who served as the Church of Ireland Bishop of Kilmore in the 1630s and early 1640s.Wilsdon, Bill, Plantation Castles on the Erne, p. 166. The History Press Ireland, Dublin, 2010. The ruins of the fortified house now sit in a small field, directly behind a modern farmhouse, just off a sideroad in the townland of Corratrasna, quite near Knockninny Methodist Church.Wilsdon, Bill, Plantation Castles on the Erne, p. 166. The History Press Ireland, Dublin, 2010. =The Troubles=Transport Derrylin is a stop on the Donegal-Enniskillen-Cavan-Dublin Airport-Dublin Bus √âireann Expressway route 30 and 30X which run alternatively. There is a coach in each direction every ninety minutes during the day as well as an overnight journey making 13 in all. Recent changes to the route mean that only the 30 bus stops in the village so in effect there is a 3 hour gap in stops.(Bus Eireann timetable) Services operate daily including Sundays. Ulsterbus route 58 from Enniskillen to Belturbet via Kinawley also serves Derrylin several times a day Mondays to Saturdays. Economy Derrylin is the hometown of former billionaire Se√°n Quinn who headed up an industrial empire concentrating on building products, glass bottle manufacture and insurance. However a disastrous bet on a dodgy share option led to his downfall and the loss of his business. The building products enterprise is now run by a consortium of local businessmen and called Quinn Industrial Holdings. The glass plant is run by Encirc. Hotels and other assets were also lost although court proceedings are currently underway to sort out the tangle. The business is trading successfully and employs about 2000 people locally and putting substantial income into the area. Other local businesses include; McCaffrey Quarries, Ernecast (Precast conc. products), Crust'n'Crumb, Teemore Engineering, Steel Solutions, Ernco Signs, Erne Lifting, A1 Transport(Road Haulage), Eco Systems Direct (Solar Energy, Gilleece Crane Hire, Total IT Solutions, McCorry Agri Supplies, JP Corry Hardware, Blake's Pub and restaurant, The Mountview Pub, Knockninney Country House and Marina, JM Engineering (Pig Pens and Lorry Accessories), Drum Engineering, Barrett's Bathrooms & Tiles, Malone and Smyth Kitchens and Furniture, Lunneys Furniture Sales, Corraquil Cruising, and a full range of small family run businesses including shops, accountants, pharmacy, childcare, schools, churches and sheltered housing for senior citizens. . Education Derrylin is home to St Aidan's High School and St Ninnidh's Primary School and Kindertee Community Playgroup. Sport Historically Some of the First GAA clubs in Fermanagh/Cavan and Ulster were located in the Derrylin/Ballyconnell and surrounding Areas. At one stage before World War I(When Derrylin had a fairly high population) there were as many as 5 teams in the Derrylin area itself. \\"Knockninney Harps\\" A Team that existed in the 1920s and 1930s won 2 County Senior Championships with a team that included the great McDonnell Brothers. Some time later due to mainly immigration, there was no team in Derrylin and star players such as Paddy Maguire and Sonny Gunn instead played for Lisnaskea, who were a very successful team from the 1930 through to the 1950s. Derrylin is the current homeplace of Derrylin O'Connells GAA Club which fields teams at all age groups up to adult. Currently there are eight teams registered. The club crest features a Blackbird perched on an oak leaf (reflecting the village nomenclature). A ladies football team called Knockninny Gaels is also based there. The Erne Boxing Club has its training facility in the village and the recently organised Rock Runners athletic club currently uses the facilities of the GAA Club.

He created the television series Veronica Mars (2004‚Äì2007, 2019), and co-created 90210 (2008‚Äì2013), Party Down (2009‚Äì2010), and iZombie (2015‚Äì2019). Education and early career Thomas was born in Sunnyside, Washington. He graduated from San Marcos High School in 1983 and went to Texas Christian University (TCU) on a football scholarship. Thomas played 11 games for the TCU Horned Frogs football team in 1984 as a backup tight end and special teams player. He had one interception that season, off a fake punt attempt by Kansas State. He later transferred to the University of Texas at Austin and graduated in 1987 with a BA in history from its College of Liberal Arts. Before he began writing novels for young adults, Thomas taught high-school journalism at John Marshall High School in San Antonio, Texas, and later at John H. Reagan High School in Austin, Texas. He also advised the University of Texas at Austin student magazine. From August 1993 to June 1995 he worked for Channel One News, an experience which informed his 1998 novel Satellite Down. Thomas was a member of three San Marcos, Texas bands‚ÄîPublic Bulletin, Hey Zeus, and Black Irish‚Äîfrom the mid-1980s to the early 1990s. Entertainment career Thomas's first television writing credit came on a 1996 episode of Cartoon Network's Space Ghost Coast to Coast. He next wrote the script that would eventually become the 1999 film Fortune Cookie. Based on the script, he was offered a job on the writing staff of Dawson's Creek during the show's first season. After reading the same script, then-president of Sony Entertainment Jeff Sagansky suggested Thomas create a romantic comedy pilot. That show soon developed into Cupid, a critically acclaimed 1998 comedy-drama series canceled after 15 episodes in 1999. This led to Thomas being asked to run ABC's 1999 series Snoops, although he left due to creative differences with David E. Kelley before the show aired. After Snoops, Thomas got pilot orders for his U.S. adaptation of the British Metropolis and original script The Sticks, but neither went to series. Thomas has also adapted the screenplay for Drive Me Crazy, and directed On Air, a twenty-minute film adaptation of a story from Doing Time. Thomas got his second show picked up in 2004 -- the critically successful but again low-rated Veronica Mars, which battled low ratings until it was canceled after the third season in 2007. He was offered the showrunner position on NBC's Friday Night Lights in 2006, which he declined in favor of the possibility (and eventual reality) of a fourth season of Veronica Mars. Thomas was also offered and declined CBS's Viva Laughlin in 2007; he joined ABC's Miss/Guided in May 2007 before leaving in July of the same year, again due to creative differences. Thomas worked as a writer on ABC's short-lived primetime series Big Shots from 2007 to 2008, co-wrote and shot the comedy pilot Party Down (aired by Starz in 2009, ran for two seasons), and had three pilots ordered for the 2008‚Äì2009 television season: a remake of Cupid for ABC, that was picked up to air midseason but soon canceled; Good Behavior, a U.S. adaptation of New Zealand series Outrageous Fortune also for ABC although it never aired, and a modern spinoff of Beverly Hills, 90210 for The CW, which he departed early in favor of his other projects. According to a June 28, 2011 article by Kate Stanhope at TV Guide, Thomas told a group at a Party Down reunion in Texas the preceding weekend that \\"People are talking to us about doing a Party Down movie, and we are pretty far down the deal-making process with that,\\" and that such a project might shoot in the spring of 2012. A December 16, 2011 piece in Gothamist reported that the movie is coming closer to reality: a treatment has been completed and Adam Scott said the film could shoot in the summer of 2012, although Starz apparently still needs to provide final approval for the project. And a January 8, 2012 piece at The Hollywood Reporter confirmed, \\"The Party Down movie is a go,\\" and according to Megan Mullally it will shoot in late spring or early summer. Little news on the project has emerged since then. On June 30, 2010, he told Kristin Dos Santos at E! Online that he was \\"writing a drama pilot set in the world of corporate espionage for Showtime.\\" On January 19, 2011, Thomas revealed the series had not been picked up. On August 25, 2010, Variety reported that NBC has ordered a pilot of a new sitcom, to be called Temp, for which Thomas, Dan Etheridge, and Jon Enbom would be executive producers. On February 10, Thomas announced: \\"NBC passed on TEMP, unfortunately. Said it skewed 'too young.'\\" On January 18, 2011, Thomas said that Fox ordered his half-hour single-camera pilot, to be called Little in Common. According to an August 25, 2011 article in The Hollywood Reporter, Little in Common, having failed to receive a pickup for the fall, \\"is being retooled\\" and may be broadcast Tuesday nights starting midseason. An October 17, 2011 item at Deadline Hollywood revealed that Fox decided not to air the show. In a wide-ranging interview with Austinist published soon afterward, Thomas discussed the situation, saying, \\"we really thought this one was going on the air. So it was both surprising and disappointing that it didn't.\\" In February 2009, according to Entertainment Weekly, Thomas fueled rumors of a possible Veronica Mars film. On March 13, 2013, Thomas posted a Kickstarter page announcing he had acquired permission from Warner Brothers to proceed with fundraising for a Veronica Mars movie; if the project raised $2 million by April 12, the film would be made. By 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the first day, the appeal had already raised over the requisite $2 million in pledges, ensuring a green light for the film, as Thomas also confirmed. The Kickstarter campaign met its goal in less than 11 hours, as an Entertainment Weekly piece noted. Thomas was also co-author of two novels which were published by Vintage Books once the movie was released in 2014; the novels depict events occurring after those of the film. In November 2013, a pilot based on Chris Roberson and Michael Allred's comic book iZOMBIE was picked up by The CW, with Thomas producing alongside Diane Ruggiero. The thirteen-episode first season of iZombie was subsequently broadcast, commencing March 17, 2015. In 2016, he announced he was working on a TV series based on the 1987 cult classic film The Lost Boys to be broadcast on the CW. His plan is that it will last 7 seasons each covering a decade in the life of the vampires, who would be different characters from the film.

Economic reformer  Overall review = After promoting a plan of free market reforms that he considered could double Chile's annual rate of growth to 7%, he became, first, Secretary of Labor and Social Security (1978‚Äì1980), and then, Secretary of Mining (1980‚Äì1981), in the cabinet of General Augusto Pinochet. As such, he was responsible for four structural reforms: the creation of a retirement system based on private personal accounts (the AFP system), the opening of the private health and disability insurance system, the redesign of the labor code changing the terms of trade union elections, and the constitutional law on mining. Pi√±era entered the cabinet in December 1978 when Chile faced two serious external threats: a possible war with Argentina over the disputed Beagle Islands and a trade boycott by the American AFL-CIO labor confederation. Pi√±era quickly announced that Chile would soon promulgate a new trade union law reestablishing labor democracy in Chile (suspended since the coup d'√©tat, September 11, 1973) and a new collective bargaining law. At the same time, the Vatican offered mediation over the Beagle Islands. = Labor reform = Pi√±era followed up on June 29, 1979, announcing a package of four related laws that transformed trade union legislation in Chile: #D.L. 2.756 reinstituted free trade unions, requiring secret votes to elect union officials and allowing free union affiliation within a company; #D.L. 2.757 regulated the creation and operation of trade and professional organisations; #D.L. 2.758 created a new decentralized collective bargaining process, whose main pillars were: ##bargaining takes place between the trade union and the employer at the company level, rather than the traditional industry or national level; ##the right to strike is defined as one of refusal to work without being fired, but not necessarily as one entailing the forced closing of productive activities; ##allowed employers to impose a lockout when some but not all unions are on strike; ##prohibited any government intervention in the process; ##instituted a mechanism of \\"pendulum arbitration\\" (also known as final offer) in public services, where disagreement led not to strikes but to compulsory arbitration by private sector arbiters, who were mandated by law to choose either the last company offer or the last trade union demand, but could not split the difference. #D.L. 2.759 solved specific labor problems and strengthened the anti-monopoly law. = Social security reform = On November 4, 1980, Pi√±era's Social Security Reforms were instituted via Decree Laws 3.500 and 3.501). These allowed workers to opt out of the government-run pension system and instead put the former payroll tax (10% of wages) in a privately managed Personal Retirement Account (PRA). New workers were automatically enrolled in the new system. These measures resulted in a privatization of Chile's social security system. This same Reform introduced two important changes to the health system: a) it fully privatized the disability insurance system, which became an integral part of the so-called \\"AFP system\\" (the AFPs are the private companies that manage the PRAs on workers' behalf); and, b) it allowed workers to opt out from the government health insurance system with all their mandatory contribution (another 7% of wages), as long as they were willing and able to buy with that money a minimum health insurance plan in what became the \\"ISAPRE system\\" (ISAPREs are private companies that offer diverse health insurance plans). The above-mentioned reform had a major impact on Chile's economy and society. By February 2011, 8.8 million individuals had a PRA. Because of movements in and out of the labor force, this number cannot be directly related to the current labor force of 7 million, out of a working-age population of 12.6 million. As regards ISAPREs, they counted for 1.2 million contributors in December 2010, who with their dependants provided health coverage to 2.7 million persons, representing about one-sixth of the total Chilean population of 16.5 million at that time. The proportion of persons covered by ISAPREs has been reducing since the mid-1990s, when it peaked at just over 25% of the population. The PRAs annual average rate of return since inception in May 1981 has been 9.27% a year, above inflation, according to the official statistics (for Fondo C) compiled by the Superintendency of Pensions (www.safp.cl). The resources accumulated in the workers accounts amount to $150 billion, or approximately 72% of Chile's GNP. According to William Lewis, total government expenditures in Chile as a percentage of GDP declined from 34.3% in 1984 to 21.9% in 1990, and of that 12.4 points decline, social security and welfare changes accounted for half.\\"The Power of Productivity\\" (University of Chicago Press, 2004), by William W. Lewis. Economist Paul Craig Roberts, who is known as the \\"Father of Reaganomics\\", has noted, that \\"Chile was the first country in the world to privatize Social Security. Pi√±era played the key role. Privatizing the pension system would have been enough to earn Pi√±era his place in history, but he also oversaw the privatization of health care\\".\\"The Capitalist Revolution in Latin America\\" (Oxford University Press, 1997) by Paul Craig Roberts and Karen LaFollete Araujo, p. 32. Some analysts and journalists have criticized the Chilean Pension system, pointing out, for example, that it did not require the self-employed to contribute or arguing that it imposed excessive administrative costs. From a different angle, a paper published by the Institute of Economic Affairs showed that the Chilean model had indeed some shortcomings. But surprisingly to some, it argued that these were a result of overregulation.\\"From Bismarck to Friedman A report submitted in 2006 by a bipartisan, government-appointed, Commissionhttp://www.consejoreformaprevisional.cl/view/informe.asp concluded that the system was working better than expected for the employed workers, that it was now technically possible and socially advisable to make the capitalisation system also compulsory for the self-employed, and that the fiscal savings arising from the transition process allowed for a strengthening and extension of the already existing safety net (consisting of a \\"pension asistencial\\" and a \\"pension minima\\", that will be combined into a \\"pens√≠on basica\\"). = Mining reform = On December 1, 1981, Pi√±era obtained approval for the Constitutional Mining Law. The law was ratified by a 7‚Äì0 vote in the Constitutional Court. The law created the legal framework supportive of the subsequent privatisation of large state-owned companies, notably in the energy and telecommunications sectors. In the 1990s, the concession system introduced by the Mining Law was extended into the infrastructure sector ‚Äì highways, ports and airports ‚Äì which had traditionally been part of the so-called public works carried out by the State.  Pi√±era on democracy  In December 1979, Pi√±era, while Secretary of Labor and Social Security, gave an important interview to the magazine Qu√© Pasa promoting his vision of a free and democratic Chile . In August 1980, Pi√±era signed the 1980 Constitution that established the transition path toward free elections in Chile. In April 1981, Pi√±era, while Secretary of Mining, confronted General Pinochet in a cabinet meeting to prevent the leading trade union leader, Manuel Bustos, from being exiled. As a result, the order was rescinded.\\"La Historia Oculta del Regimen Militar\\" (La Epoca, 1988), por Ascanio Cavallo, Manuel Salazar y Oscar Sep√∫lveda, p. 275. A year after Pi√±era resigned his Ministry position in December 1981, Manuel Bustos was exiled to Rio de Janeiro. On December 2, 1981, the day after approval of the Mining Law, Pi√±era resigned in order to restart his opinion magazine Economia y Sociedad, which was dedicated to fight for the transition to a democratic system and the consolidation of the free- market economy.\\"Pinochet. La Biograf√≠a\\" (El Mercurio-Aguilar, 2002) by Gonzalo Vial Correa, p. 433. In those years, still under the military regime, Pi√±era wrote seventy articles in the press in defense of human rights and democracy.\\"Camino Nuevo\\" (Proyecto Chile 2010, 1993), Appendix by Soames Floweree titled \\"What Jos√© Pi√±era said about human rights and democracy during the military regime\\". In March 1990, after Chile's transition to democracy, he founded the \\"Proyecto Chile 2010\\". He described the goal as making Chile a developed country at its bicentenary. In 1992, in order to prove that the poor could understand free market solutions to their problems, he ran and was elected city councilman with the highest vote for one of Santiago's poorest neighborhoods, Conchal√≠. In 1993, in order to defend and explain to the population at large his free market reforms, he ran a testimonial presidential campaign as an independent. As a result, his legacy has been kept intact by the four Concertacion governments in the period 1990‚Äì2010. In December 2009, Pi√±era shared a panel with the Polish trade union leader Lech Walesa in an International Conference in Zagreb dedicated to the theme of the prospects of democracy in Europe 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The conference was organized by Damian von Stauffenberg, member of the famed aristocratic family that opposed Hitler, and president of the Educational Initiative for Central and Eastern Europe (EICEE). Diario Financiero of Chile published this note and Ian Vasquez, Director of Cato's Institute for Global Liberty, wrote that both Pi√±era and Lech Walesa \\"have done so much to increase human freedom: Walesa for leading a workers' movement that played a key role in the collapse of Soviet communism; and Jos√© Pi√±era for leading a revolution in private pensions that is turning workers into capitalists around the world.\\" Promoter of privatized pensions In 1994, Pi√±era founded \\"The International Center for Pension Reform\\" in order to promote the Chilean model throughout the world. In 1995, he became also the co-chair of the United States Cato Institute's Project on Social Security Choice.\\"The Triumph of Liberty\\" (The Free Press, 2000), by Jim Powell, p.453. Since then he is said to have visited around 80 countries, 28 of which have implemented personal retirement accounts following the \\"Pi√±era model\\". Unable to finance the transition toward a fully funded system, most of them combined it with their former state-run defined- benefit pension scheme. The President of the \\"International Federation of Pension Fund Managers\\" has commented: \\"Towards the end of the year 2006, 28 countries (11 in Latin America, 12 in Central and Eastern Europe and five in other parts of the world) had already introduced mandated pension programs based on individual capitalization in their respective social security systems. A total of 100 million workers now have pension savings accounts in this type of program and have built up funds of over US$ 255 billions. Ukraine and Romania have already enacted reforms ‚Äì to be implemented between 2008 and 2009 which include the introduction of mandated capitalization programs in their respective social security systems.\\" In June 2007, the South African press published an article titled \\"Applying passion to break poverty\\" reporting on Pi√±era's conferences in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban. In May 2008, Richard Rahn, Chairman of the Institute for Global Economic Growth, wrote in The Washington Times: \\"If you were asked to name one person who has enabled more people to gain wealth and security than any other person on the globe, who would you name? In 1881, here in Berlin, Otto von Bismarck started the world's first modern pay-as-you-go social security system which served as the model for the U.S. Social Security system and that of many other countries, including setting the retirement age at 65. No, Bismarck is not the answer to the opening question. The answer is Jose Pinera.\\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/may/15/a-working-model  Econom√≠a y Sociedad  In November 2016, Pi√±era relaunched Econom√≠a y Sociedad, a magazine that was founded by him in 1978. This magazine contains articles about economics, politics, social reforms, history and other interesting issues of public policies and today is a means to diffuse and defend liberal ideas in Chile.

Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs, also known as chimeric immunoreceptors, chimeric T cell receptors or artificial T cell receptors) are receptor proteins that have been engineered to give T cells the new ability to target a specific protein. The receptors are chimeric because they combine both antigen-binding and T-cell activating functions into a single receptor. CAR-T cell therapy uses T cells engineered with CARs for cancer therapy. The premise of CAR-T immunotherapy is to modify T cells to recognize cancer cells in order to more effectively target and destroy them. Scientists harvest T cells from people, genetically alter them, then infuse the resulting CAR-T cells into patients to attack their tumors. CAR-T cells can be either derived from T cells in a patient's own blood (autologous) or derived from the T cells of another healthy donor (allogeneic). Once isolated from a person, these T cells are genetically engineered to express a specific CAR, which programs them to target an antigen that is present on the surface of tumors. For safety, CAR-T cells are engineered to be specific to an antigen expressed on a tumor that is not expressed on healthy cells. After CAR-T cells are infused into a patient, they act as a \\"living drug\\" against cancer cells. When they come in contact with their targeted antigen on a cell, CAR-T cells bind to it and become activated, then proceed to proliferate and become cytotoxic. CAR-T cells destroy cells through several mechanisms, including extensive stimulated cell proliferation, increasing the degree to which they are toxic to other living cells (cytotoxicity) and by causing the increased secretion of factors that can affect other cells such as cytokines, interleukins and growth factors.  Production  Depiction of adoptive cell transfer therapy with CAR-engineered T cells The first step in the production of CAR-T cells is the isolation of T cells from human blood. CAR-T cells may be manufactured either from the patient's own blood, known as an autologous treatment, or from the blood of a healthy donor, known as an allogeneic treatment. The manufacturing process is the same in both cases; only the choice of initial blood donor is different. First, leukocytes are isolated using a blood cell separator in a process known as leukocyte apheresis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are then separated and collected. The products of leukocyte apheresis are then transferred to a cell-processing center. In the cell processing center, specific T cells are stimulated so that they will actively proliferate and expand to large numbers. To drive their expansion, T cells are typically treated with the cytokine interleukin 2 (IL-2) and anti-CD3 antibodies. The expanded T cells are purified and then transduced with a gene encoding the engineered CAR via a retroviral vector, typically either an integrating gammaretrovirus (RV) or a lentiviral (LV) vector. These vectors are very safe in modern times due to a partial deletion of the U3 region. The new gene editing tool CRISPR/Cas9 has recently been used instead of retroviral vectors to integrate the CAR gene into specific sites in the genome. The patient undergoes lymphodepletion chemotherapy prior to the introduction of the engineered CAR-T cells. The depletion of the number of circulating leukocytes in the patient upregulates the number of cytokines that are produced and reduces competition for resources, which helps to promote the expansion of the engineered CAR-T cells.  Cancer treatment  The diagram above represents the process of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR), this is a method of immunotherapy, which is a growing practice in the treatment of cancer. The final result should be a production of equipped T-cells that can recognize and fight the infected cancer cells in the body. 1\\\\. T-cells (represented by objects labeled as ‚Äôt‚Äô) are removed from the patient's blood. 2\\\\. Then in a lab setting the gene that encodes for the specific antigen receptors are incorporated into the T-cells. 3\\\\. Thus producing the CAR receptors (labeled as c) on the surface of the cells. 4\\\\. The newly modified T-cells are then further harvested and grown in the lab. 5\\\\. After a certain time period, the engineered T-cells are infused back into the patient. T cells are genetically engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors specifically directed toward antigens on a patient's tumor cells, then infused into the patient where they attack and kill the cancer cells. Adoptive transfer of T cells expressing CARs is a promising anti-cancer therapeutic, because CAR-modified T cells can be engineered to target virtually any tumor associated antigen. Early CAR-T cell research has focused on blood cancers. The first approved treatments use CARs that target the antigen CD19, present in B-cell-derived cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). There are also efforts underway to engineer CARs targeting many other blood cancer antigens, including CD30 in refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma; CD33, CD123, and FLT3 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML); and BCMA in multiple myeloma. Solid tumors have presented a more difficult target. Identification of good antigens has been challenging: such antigens must be highly expressed on the majority of cancer cells, but largely absent on normal tissues. CAR-T cells are also not trafficked efficiently into the center of solid tumor masses, and the hostile tumor microenvironment suppresses T cell activity. = Clinical studies and FDA approvals = The first two FDA-approved CAR-T therapies both target the CD19 antigen, which is found on many types of B-cell cancers. Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah / Novartis) is approved to treat relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), while axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta / Kite Pharma) is approved to treat relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). As of March 2019, there were around 364 ongoing clinical trials happening globally involving CAR-T cells. The majority of those trials target blood cancers: CAR-T therapies account for more than half of all trials for hematological malignancies. CD19 continues to be the most popular antigen target,Brudno and Kochenderfer. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies for lymphoma. Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology. 2018. 15: 31-46. followed by BCMA (commonly expressed in multiple myeloma).Mikkilineni and Kochenderfer. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies for multiple myeloma. Blood. 2017. 130: 2594-602 In 2016, studies began to explore the viability of other antigens, such as CD20. Trials for solid tumors are less dominated by CAR-T, with about half of cell therapy-based trials involving other platforms such as NK cells. Although the initial clinical remission rates after CAR-T cell therapy in all patients are as high as 90%, long term survival rates are much lower. The cause is typically the emergence of leukemia cells that do not express CD19 and so evade recognition by the CD19‚ÄìCAR T cells, a phenomenon known as antigen escape. Preclinical studies developing CAR-T cells with dual targeting of CD19 plus CD22 or CD19 plus CD20 have demonstrated promise, and trials studying bispecific targeting to circumvent CD19 down-regulation are ongoing. = Safety concerns = There are serious side effects that result from CAR-T cells being introduced into the body, including cytokine release syndrome and neurological toxicity. Because it is a relatively new treatment, there is little data about the long-term effects of CAR-T cell therapy. There are still concerns about long-term patient survival, as well as pregnancy complications in female patients treated with CAR-T cells. The most common issue after treatment with CAR-T cells is cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a condition in which the immune system is activated and releases an increased number of inflammatory cytokines. The clinical manifestation of this syndrome resembles sepsis with high fever, fatigue, myalgia, nausea, capillary leakages, tachycardia and other cardiac dysfunction, liver failure, and kidney impairment. CRS occurs in almost all patients treated with CAR-T cell therapy; in fact, the presence of CRS is a diagnostic marker that indicates the CAR-T cells are working as intended to kill the cancer cells. Note, however, that a higher grade of CRS severity does not correlate with an increased response to the treatment, but rather higher disease burden. Neurological toxicity is also often associated with CAR-T cell treatment. The underlying mechanism is poorly understood, and may or may not be related to CRS. Clinical manifestations include delirium, the partial loss of the ability to speak coherently while still having the ability to interpret language (expressive aphasia), lowered alertness (obtundation), and seizures. During some clinical trials deaths caused by neurotoxicity have occurred. The main cause of death from neurotoxicity is cerebral edema. In a study carried out by Juno Therapeutics, Inc., five patients enrolled in the trial died as a result of cerebral edema. Two of the patients were treated with cyclophosphamide alone and the remaining three were treated with a combination of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. In another clinical trial sponsored by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, there was one reported case of irreversible and fatal neurological toxicity 122 days after the administration of CAR-T cells. Anaphylaxis is an expected side effect, as the CAR is made with a foreign monoclonal antibody and as a result, provokes an immune response. On-target/off-tumor recognition occurs when the CAR-T cell recognizes the correct antigen, but the antigen is expressed on healthy, non-pathogenic tissue. This results in the CAR-T cells attacking non-tumor tissue, such as healthy B cells that express CD19. The severity of this adverse effect can vary from B-cell aplasia, which can be treated with supporting infusions, to extreme toxicity leading to death. There is also the unlikely possibility that the engineered CAR-T cells will themselves become transformed into cancerous cells through insertional mutagenesis, due to the viral vector inserting the CAR gene into a tumor suppressor or oncogene in the host T cell's genome. Some retroviral (RV) vectors carry a lower risk than lentiviral (LV) vectors. However, both have the potential to be oncogenic. Genomic sequencing analysis of CAR insertion sites in T cells has been established for better understanding of CAR T cell function and persistence in vivo.  Receptor structure  Chimeric antigen receptors combine many facets of normal T cell activation into a single protein. They link an extracellular antigen recognition domain to an intracellular signalling domain, which activates the T cell when an antigen is bound. CARs are composed of four regions: an antigen recognition domain, an extracellular hinge region, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular T-cell signaling domain. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. TCR = Antigen recognition domain = The antigen recognition domain is exposed to the outside of the cell, in the ectodomain portion of the receptor. It interacts with potential target molecules and is responsible for targeting the CAR-T cell to any cell expressing a matching molecule. The antigen recognition domain is typically derived from the variable regions of a monoclonal antibody linked together as a single-chain variable fragment (scFv). An scFv is a chimeric protein made up of the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains of immunoglobins, connected with a short linker peptide. These VL and VH regions are selected in advance for their binding ability to the target antigen (such as CD19). The linker between the two chains consists of hydrophilic residues with stretches of glycine and serine in it for flexibility as well as stretches of glutamate and lysine for added solubility. Single domain antibodies (e.g. VH, VHH) have been engineered and developed as antigen recognition domains in the CAR format due to their high transduction efficiency in T cells. In addition to antibody fragments, non‚Äêantibody‚Äêbased approaches have also been used to direct CAR specificity, usually taking advantage of ligand/receptor pairs that normally bind to each other. Cytokines, innate immune receptors, TNF receptors, growth factors, and structural proteins have all been successfully used as CAR antigen recognition domains. = Hinge region = The hinge, also called a spacer, is a small structural domain that sits between the antigen recognition region and the cell's outer membrane. An ideal hinge enhances the flexibility of the scFv receptor head, reducing the spatial constraints between the CAR and its target antigen. This promotes antigen binding and synapse formation between the CAR-T cells and target cells. Hinge sequences are often based on membrane-proximal regions from other immune molecules including IgG, CD8, and CD28. = Transmembrane domain = The transmembrane domain is a structural component, consisting of a hydrophobic alpha helix that spans the cell membrane. It anchors the CAR to the plasma membrane, bridging the extracellular hinge and antigen recognition domains with the intracellular signaling region. This domain is essential for the stability of the receptor as a whole. Generally, the transmembrane domain from the most membrane-proximal component of the endodomain is used, but different transmembrane domains result in different receptor stability. The CD28 transmembrane domain is known to result in a highly expressed, stable receptor. Using the CD3-zeta transmembrane domain is not recommended, as it can result in incorporation of the artificial TCR into the native TCR. = Intracellular T-cell signaling domain = The intracellular T-cell signaling domain lies in the receptor's endodomain, inside the cell. After an antigen is bound to the external antigen recognition domain, CAR receptors cluster together and transmit an activation signal. Then the internal cytoplasmic end of the receptor perpetuates signaling inside the T cell. Normal T cell activation relies on the phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) present in the cytoplasmic domain of CD3-zeta. To mimic this process, CD3-zeta's cytoplasmic domain is commonly used as the main CAR endodomain component. Other ITAM- containing domains have also been tried, but are not as effective. T cells also require co-stimulatory molecules in addition to CD3 signaling in order to persist after activation. For this reason, the endodomains of CAR receptors typically also include one or more chimeric domains from co-stimulatory proteins. Signaling domains from a wide variety of co-stimulatory molecules have been successfully tested, including CD28, CD27, CD134 (OX40), and CD137 (4‚Äê1BB).  Evolution of CAR design  Depiction of first, second, and third generation chimeric antigen receptors with the scFv segments in green and the various TCR signalling components in red, blue and yellow. The first CAR-T cells were developed in 1987 by Yoshikazu Kuwana et al. followed in 1989 by Gideon Gross and Zelig Eshhar at Weizmann Institute, Israel. The sophistication of the engineered CAR receptors has grown over time, and are referred to as first, second, third, or fourth generation CARs depending on their composition. First generation CARs are composed of an extracellular binding domain, a hinge region, a transmembrane domain, and one or more intracellular signaling domains. The extracellular binding domain contains a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from tumor antigen‚Äêreactive antibodies that usually has a high specificity to a specific tumor antigen. All CARs contain the CD3Œ∂ chain domain as the intracellular signaling domain, which is the primary transmitter of T cell activation signals. Second generation CARs add a co‚Äêstimulatory domain, like CD28 or 4‚Äê1BB. The involvement of these intracellular signaling domains improve T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, resistance to apoptosis, and in vivo persistence. Third generation CARs combine multiple co-stimulatory domains, such as CD28-41BB or CD28-OX40, to augment T cell activity. Preclinical data show the third-generation CARs exhibit improved effector functions and better in vivo persistence as compared to second‚Äêgeneration CARs. Fourth generation CARs (also known as TRUCKs or armored CARs) further add factors that enhance T cell expansion, persistence, and anti‚Äêtumoral activity. This can include cytokines, such is IL-2, IL-5, IL-12 and co‚Äêstimulatory ligands. in 2018, a version of CAR was developed that is referred to as SUPRA CAR, or split, universal, and programmable. Multiple mechanisms can be deployed to finely regulate the activity of SUPRA CAR, which limits overactivation. In contrast to the traditional CAR design, SUPRA CAR allows targeting of multiple antigens without further genetic modification of a person's immune cells. = Control mechanisms = Adding a synthetic control mechanism to engineered T cells allows doctors to precisely control the persistence or activity of the T cells in the patient's body, with the goal of reducing toxic side effects. The major control techniques trigger T cell death or limit T cell activation, and often regulate the T cells via a separate drug that can be introduced or withheld as needed. Suicide genes: Genetically modified T cells are engineered to include one or more genes that can induce apoptosis when activated by an extracellular molecule. Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) and inducible caspase 9 (iCasp9) are two types of suicide genes that have been integrated into CAR-T cells. In the iCasp9 system, the suicide gene complex has two elements: a mutated FK506-binding protein with high specificity to the small molecule rimiducid/AP1903, and a gene encoding a pro-domain-deleted human caspase 9. Dosing the patient with rimiducid activates the suicide system, leading to rapid apoptosis of the genetically modified T cells. Although both the HSV-TK and iCasp9 systems demonstrate a noticeable function as a safety switch in clinical trials, some defects limit their application. HSV-TK is virus-derived and may be immunogenic to humans. It is also currently unclear whether the suicide gene strategies will act quickly enough in all situations to halt dangerous off-tumor cytotoxicity. Dual-antigen receptor: CAR-T cells are engineered to express two tumor-associated antigen receptors at the same time, reducing the likelihood that the T cells will attack non-tumor cells. Dual- antigen receptor CAR-T cells have been reported to have less intense side effects. An in vivo study in mice shows that dual-receptor CAR-T cells effectively eradicated prostate cancer and achieved complete long-term survival. ON-switch: In this system, CAR-T cells can only function in the presence of both tumor antigen and a benign exogenous molecule. To achieve this, the CAR-T cell's engineered chimeric antigen receptor is split into two separate proteins that must come together in order to function. The first receptor protein typically contains the extracellular antigen binding domain, while the second protein contains the downstream signaling elements and co- stimulatory molecules (such as CD3Œ∂ and 4-1BB). In the presence of an exogenous molecule (such as a rapamycin analog), the binding and signaling proteins dimerize together, allowing the CAR-T cells to attack the tumor. Bispecific molecules as switches: Bispecific molecules target both a tumor- associated antigen and the CD3 molecule on the surface of T cells. This ensures that the T cells cannot become activated unless they are in close physical proximity to a tumor cell. The anti-CD20/CD3 bispecific molecule shows high specificity to both malignant B cells and cancer cells in mice. FITC is another bifunctional molecule used in this strategy. FITC can redirect and regulate the activity of the FITC-specific CAR-T cells toward tumor cells with folate receptors. = Small molecule drug conjugates adaptor technology = SMDCs (small molecule drug conjugates) platform in immuno-oncology is an experimental approach that makes possible the engineering of a single universal CAR T cell, which binds with extraordinarily high affinity to a benign molecule designated as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). These cells are then used to treat various cancer types when co-administered with bispecific SMDC adaptor molecules. These unique bispecific adaptors are constructed with a FITC molecule and a tumor-homing molecule to precisely bridge the universal CAR T cell with the cancer cells, which causes localized T cell activation. Anti-tumor activity in mice is induced only when both the universal CAR T cells plus the correct antigen-specific adaptor molecules are present. Anti-tumor activity and toxicity can be controlled by adjusting the administered adaptor molecule dosing.

He is the men's basketball coach at High Point University, his alma mater. Smith previously served in the same role at the University of Tulsa, the University of Georgia, the University of Kentucky, the University of Minnesota, Texas Tech University, and the University of Memphis. With Kentucky, he coached the Wildcats to the 1998 NCAA championship. In his 28 years as a head coach, Smith has achieved 26 winning seasons. In 2005, he joined Roy Williams, Nolan Richardson, Denny Crum, and Jim Boeheim as the only head coaches to win 365 games in 15 seasons or fewer. With Texas Tech's invitation to the 2016 NCAA Tournament, Smith became only the second coach in history to lead five different teams to the NCAA tournament. Smith's three sons are following in their father's coaching footsteps. G.G. Smith, who played for his father at the University of Georgia, was formerly the head coach at Loyola (Md), and is currently the associate head coach at High Point. His middle son Saul Smith played for his father at the University of Kentucky and was an assistant coach for his father at Memphis. Brian, his youngest son, was a point guard at Ole Miss and is the head coach at Saint John Paul II Academy in Boca Raton, Florida. Early years Smith was born in Scotland, Maryland, in Saint Mary's County, the sixth of 17 children born to sharecroppers Guffrie and Parthenia Smith. His large family accounts for his unusual nickname. Of all the Smith children, Tubby was most fond of staying in the galvanized washtub where the children were bathed. Smith says he tried to shake the moniker several times, but it stuck incessantly. He recalls that a 10th grade teacher who didn't tolerate nicknames was the last person to call him by his proper name, Orlando. After having a scholarship offer from the University of Maryland rescinded, Smith enrolled at High Point College (now High Point University), graduating in 1973. He played under three head coaches at High Point, including future boss J. D. Barnett. He lettered four times and was an all-conference performer as a senior. Smith earned a Bachelor of Science degree in health and physical education while at High Point, and also met his future wife, Donna, who was the homecoming queen. In 1973, Smith began his coaching career with four years at his high school alma mater ‚Äì Great Mills High School in Great Mills, Maryland, compiling a 46‚Äì36 record. His next stop was Hoke County High School in Raeford, North Carolina, where he recorded a 28‚Äì18 mark in two seasons. Assistant coaching positionsVCU= Smith began as assistant coach at Virginia Commonwealth University under his former High Point coach J. D. Barnett. From 1979 to 1986, VCU amassed a 144‚Äì64 record, winning three Sun Belt Conference Championships. Smith took two important things away from his experience as an assistant coach for the Rams. First, under Barnett, Smith learned the principles of the ball-line defense, a hallmark of Smith's teams throughout his head coaching career. Second was a relationship with fellow assistant David Hobbs, an assistant and associate head coach under Smith during his tenure at the University of Kentucky. =South Carolina= Smith left Virginia Commonwealth in 1986 to join George Felton's staff at the University of South Carolina. Felton remembered Smith from having recruited one of his players while Smith was at Hoke High School. During Smith's three years, the Gamecocks were 53‚Äì35. Later, roles would be reversed, with Smith bringing Felton in as an assistant coach at Kentucky. =Kentucky= Smith joined the University of Kentucky under then head coach Rick Pitino, who had the challenge of rebuilding a UK program that had been rocked by NCAA probation and player defections. With only eight scholarship student-athletes, none taller than 6‚Äì7, the staff molded the Cats into winners once again, exceeding expectations to record a 14‚Äì14 mark. The following year, with Smith promoted to associate coach and UK still on probation, the Wildcats earned a 22‚Äì6 record, a final ranking of ninth in the AP poll, and an SEC-best 14‚Äì4 record. Smith wasn't the only soon-to-be high-profile name on Pitino's coaching staff at Kentucky. Future head coaches Ralph Willard, Herb Sendek, Billy Donovan, and Bernadette Locke-Mattox were all Smith's colleagues. Head coaching careerTulsa= From 1991 to 1995, Smith led the Tulsa Golden Hurricane men's basketball to a 79‚Äì43 record. Rebuilding the basketball program his first two years, he then led the team to two consecutive Missouri Valley Conference regular season titles and two appearances in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament in 1994 and 1995. Smith's 1994 Tulsa team upset UCLA in the tourney's first round before knocking off Oklahoma State. In '95, the Golden Hurricane defeated Big Ten team Illinois to open March Madness. =Georgia= On March 29, 1995, Smith accepted the head coaching job at the University of Georgia, becoming the school's first African-American head coach. In two seasons, he led the Bulldogs to a 45‚Äì19 record, including the first back-to-back seasons of 20 wins or more in school history. His teams achieved a Sweet 16 finish in the 1996 NCAA Tournament and lost in the first round of the 1997 NCAA Tournament. The Bulldogs defeated Clemson to open the '96 tournament before upsetting the top-seeded Purdue Boilermakers. =Kentucky= Tubby Smith was introduced as the Wildcats' 20th head coach on May 12, 1997, charged with the task of replacing popular coach Rick Pitino, who left to become the head coach of the NBA's Boston Celtics. The Wildcats were at the top of the basketball world at the time, having won a national title in 1996 and played in the national title game in 1997. The team Smith inherited had seven players from the Arizona loss and five from the 1996 championship team. In his first season at UK, he coached the Wildcats to their seventh NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, including a come-from- behind victory against Duke in the Elite Eight. His 1998 national championship is unique in modern times, as being the only team in over twenty years to win without a first-team All-American or future NBA lottery pick. (see 1998 NCAA Tournament). Smith's teams, known primarily for a defense-oriented slower style of play coined \\"Tubbyball\\", received mixed reviews among Kentucky fans who have historically enjoyed a faster, higher-scoring style of play under previous coaches. Smith was also known for using the ball line defense. Smith led Kentucky to one national championship in 1998, a perfect 16‚Äì0 regular season conference record in 2003, five SEC regular season championships (1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005) and five SEC Tournament titles (1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004). Smith led the Wildcats to six Sweet Sixteen appearances (1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005) and four Elite Eight appearances (1998, 1999, 2003, 2005) in his ten seasons. He totaled 100 wins quicker than any other Wildcat coach except Hall of Fame member Adolph Rupp and current Wildcat coach John Calipari, reaching the plateau in 130 games. Smith was named National Coach of the Year in 2003 and SEC Coach of the Year in 1998, 2003, and 2005. Smith came under considerable pressure from many UK fans late in his tenure. Many thought that his recruiting was subpar, as he regularly struggled to land top recruits. Kentucky fans also became impatient that his teams never reached another Final Four during his tenure. Some UK fans went as far as to place \\"for sale\\" signs on his front lawn. Smith did come just a double overtime loss short of a Final Four appearance in 2005, losing to Tom Izzo's Michigan State Spartans. Smith's Kentucky teams also lost in the regional finals of both the 1999 and 2003 NCAA tournaments. Smith also had five double digit loss seasons (which led to his critics nicknaming him \\"Ten-Loss Tubby\\"), which caused the pressure to ramp up on him. On March 22, 2007, Smith resigned his position of UK head coach to accept the head coach position at the University of Minnesota.ESPN ‚Äì Smith leaving Kentucky to coach Minnesota ‚Äì Men's College Basketball.

In Smith's first season, the team improved from 8‚Äì22 in 2006‚Äì07 to 20‚Äì14 in 2007‚Äì08, and reached the Big Ten Tournament semifinals after defeating second-seeded Indiana. In the 2008‚Äì09 season, Smith led Minnesota to a record of 22‚Äì11 and a bid to the NCAA tournament, where the team was eliminated in the opening round. In the 2009‚Äì10 season, Smith's team struggled throughout the year with off court issues and close losses. However, in the Big Ten Tournament, Smith guided the team to win three games in three days to advance to Minnesota's first ever appearance in the Big Ten championship game. Though it lost that game, the team's run vaulted it into the NCAA tournament for the second consecutive year, where it again lost in the first round. In 2008, Smith had the highest salary of any state employee in Minnesota.Howatt, Glenn ‚Äì \\"Quick, find the 1,425 people who earn more than the guv\\" Star Tribune, July 17, 2008. \\"The highest paid include county attorneys and medical examiners, a zoo director, state treatment center medical workers and more than 800 university professors.

He replaced Billy Gillispie (who ironically replaced Smith after he left Kentucky in 2007), who resigned from Texas Tech on September 20, 2012 and Chris Walker, who served as the interim coach following Gillispie's resignation. Texas Tech had failed to make the NCAA tournament in the 7 years prior to Smith's hire at the school. Tubby Smith's first season (2013‚Äì2014) proved to be a challenge. The Red Raiders led by Jaye Crockett started the season 8‚Äì5 in non conference only to fade during Big 12 play finishing with a 6‚Äì12 conference mark. Although the team faded down the stretch, it showed that it could compete with the upper teams in the Big 12 as the Red Raiders won two games against ranked competition and lost many close games. The team finished with a 14‚Äì18 record overall and 9th in the 10 team Big 12. This season marked Smith's first losing season as a head coach in his career and proved that the rebuilding job in Lubbock was massive. Smith's second season started with Smith attempting to improve the Red Raiders talent level. Smith added Keenan Evans, Justin Gray, Norense Odiase, and Zach Smith in the offseason in the hopes of improving a depleted Red Raider team. The season ended up being a massive disappointment as the Red Raiders got worse than the 2013‚Äì2014 season and finished 13‚Äì19 with only 3 victories coming in the Big 12. Although, the season was labeled a massive disappointment, Smith led the Red Raiders to their first victory over a top 25 team since the 2009 season with a January 15, 2014 upset over the #9 Iowa State Cyclones. Although the season started with plenty of promise, the Red Raiders finished a mediocre season with a first round Big 12 tournament exit against the Texas Longhorns. The 2015‚Äì16 season proved to be Smith's best, his 3rd season at Texas Tech, the Red Raiders started the season with a 12‚Äì7 record and a 2‚Äì6 record in the Big 12. The Red Raiders eventually led a turnaround and won 3 straight games against ranked opponents for the first time in school history. The season featured young stars Evans, Gray, Odiase, and Smith as well as senior leaders Devaugntah Williams and Toddrick Gotcher. The team proved to be well balanced and efficient on both sides of the ball. The Red Raiders made good use of Smith's ball line defense. The Red Raiders would close out the 2015‚Äì16 regular season by winning 6 of their last 8 games and finishing with an overall 19‚Äì12 record with a 9‚Äì9 record in Big 12 play. The turnaround was the biggest in the Big 12 with the Red Raiders completing a six-game improvement from the year prior in arguably the toughest conference in the country. On March 13, 2016, the Red Raiders were selected to participate in the 2016 NCAA Tournament. Smith was named the Big 12 Coach of the Year for orchestrating the turnaround. On March 8, Smith was named as the Sporting News Coach of the Year for his rebuilding effort. =Memphis= On April 14, 2016, Smith accepted the head coaching position at Memphis, replacing former Memphis coach Josh Pastner who took the job at Georgia Tech.

As St. Matthew's Cathedral and Rectory, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The cathedral is in downtown Washington at 1725 Rhode Island Avenue NW between Connecticut Avenue and 17th Street. The closest Metrorail station is Farragut North, on the Red Line. It is seven blocks north and two blocks west of the White House. History St. Matthew's is dedicated to the Apostle Matthew, who among other things is patron saint of civil servants, having himself been a tax collector. It was established in 1840 by pastor Father William Matthews and assistant pastor Father John Philip Donelan. The church was dedicated on November 1, 1840, though the structure had not yet been entirely completed. Originally located at 15th and H Streets, construction of the current church began in 1893, with the first Mass being celebrated June 2, 1895. Construction continued until 1913 when the church was dedicated. In 1939, it became the cathedral for the newly established Archdiocese of Washington. Architecture The structure is constructed of red brick with sandstone and terra cotta trim in the Romanesque Revival style with Byzantine elements. Designed by architect C. Grant La Farge, it is in the shape of a Latin cross measuring and seats about 1,200 persons. The interior is richly decorated in marble and semiprecious stones, notably a mosaic of Matthew behind the main altar by Edwin Blashfield. The cathedral is capped by an octagonal dome that extends above the nave and is capped by a cupola and crucifix that brings the total height to . Both structural and decorative elements underwent extensive restoration between 2000 and September 21, 2003, the feast day of St. Matthew. Historic events Rectory The first notable funeral Mass offered at St. Matthew's was for Manuel L. Quezon, the president of the Philippines, who died August 1, 1944, and was interred at Arlington National Cemetery until the end of World War II. In 1957, a Solemn Requiem Mass was offered at the cathedral for the funeral of Senator Joseph McCarthy; the liturgy was attended by 70 senators and hundreds of clergymen and it was filled to capacity. The cathedral drew worldwide attention following the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy on Friday, November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas. Richard, Cardinal Cushing, Archbishop of Boston and a Kennedy family friend, offered a recited (not sung) Pontifical Requiem Low Mass during the state funeral on Monday, November 25, 1963 was followed by the procession to Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia for the burial. Commemoration of where John F. Kennedy's Casket was Placed for His Requiem Mass. Other notable events at the cathedral include a Mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II during his 1979 visit to Washington, D.C., and the 1997 funeral of U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. The cathedral was the site of a Lutheran funeral service for Chief Justice William Rehnquist on September 7, 2005. The funeral of television anchorman Frank Reynolds was held at the cathedral in 1983. President and Mrs. Reagan were among the 1,100 in attendance on Saturday, July 23, followed by burial at Arlington. St. Matthew's is the location for one of the most famous Red Masses in the world. Each year on the day before the term of the Supreme Court of the United States begins, Mass is celebrated to request guidance from the Holy Spirit for the legal profession. Owing to the Cathedral's location in the nation's capital, the Justices of the Supreme Court, members of Congress and the Cabinet, and many other dignitaries (including, at times, the President of the United States) attend the Mass. Dwight Eisenhower became the first to attend as president in 1954; Harry Truman attended nine years earlier, but as vice president. In 2020. St. Matthew's hosted its first Archdiocesan Easter Mass since 1959. The mass, televised on EWTN and on livestream, was celebrated by Archbishop Wilton Gregory in front of an empty cathedral. The Archdiocese's Easter and Christmas midnight masses, both of which have been televised on EWTN in recent decades, have normally been held at the much larger Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception since it was dedicated in November 1959. The reason was the Easter mass was moved back from the Basilica to St. Matthew's for 2020 was due to coronavirus, which kept many churches closed that weekend.

Symptoms may include bone pain, a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest, or a painless bluish lump under the skin. Typically, neuroblastoma occurs due to a genetic mutation occurring during early development. Rarely, it may be due to a mutation inherited from a person's parents. Environmental factors have not been found to be involved. Diagnosis is based on a tissue biopsy. Occasionally, it may be found in a baby by ultrasound during pregnancy. At diagnosis, the cancer has usually already spread. The cancer is divided into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups based on a child's age, cancer stage, and what the cancer looks like. Treatment and outcomes depends on the risk group a person is in. Treatments may include observation, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or stem cell transplantation. Low-risk disease in babies typically has a good outcome with surgery or simply observation. In high-risk disease, chances of long-term survival, however, are less than 40%, despite aggressive treatment. Neuroblastoma is the most common cancer in babies and the third-most common cancer in children after leukemia and brain cancer. About one in every 7,000 children is affected at some time. About 90% of cases occur in children less than 5 years old, and it is rare in adults. Of cancer deaths in children, about 15% are due to neuroblastoma. The disease was first described in the 1800s. Signs and symptoms The first symptoms of neuroblastoma are often vague, making diagnosis difficult. Fatigue, loss of appetite, fever, and joint pain are common. Symptoms depend on primary tumor locations and metastases if present: * In the abdomen, a tumor may cause a swollen belly and constipation. * A tumor in the chest may cause breathing problems. * A tumor pressing on the spinal cord may cause weakness, thus an inability to stand, crawl, or walk. * Bone lesions in the legs and hips may cause pain and limping. * A tumor in the bones around the eyes or orbits may cause distinct bruising and swelling. * Infiltration of the bone marrow may cause pallor from anemia. Neuroblastoma often spreads to other parts of the body before any symptoms are apparent, and 50 to 60% of all neuroblastoma cases present with metastases. The most common location for neuroblastoma to originate (i.e., the primary tumor) is in the adrenal glands. This occurs in 40% of localized tumors and in 60% of cases of widespread disease. Neuroblastoma can also develop anywhere along the sympathetic nervous system chain from the neck to the pelvis. Frequencies in different locations include: neck (1%), chest (19%), abdomen (30% nonadrenal), or pelvis (1%). In rare cases, no primary tumor can be discerned. Rare but characteristic presentations include transverse myelopathy (tumor spinal cord compression, 5% of cases), treatment-resistant diarrhea (tumor vasoactive intestinal peptide secretion, 4% of cases), Horner's syndrome (cervical tumor, 2.4% of cases), opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome and ataxia (suspected paraneoplastic cause, 1.3% of cases), and hypertension (catecholamine secretion or kidney artery compression, 1.3% of cases). Cause The cause of neuroblastoma is not well understood. The great majority of cases are sporadic and nonfamilial. About 1‚Äì2% of cases run in families and have been linked to specific gene mutations. Familial neuroblastoma in some cases is caused by rare germline mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. Germline mutations in the PHOX2B or KIF1B gene have been implicated in familial neuroblastoma, as well. Neuroblastoma is also a feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 and the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. MYCN oncogene amplification within the tumor is a common finding in neuroblastoma. The degree of amplification shows a bimodal distribution: either 3- to 10-fold, or 100- to 300-fold. The presence of this mutation is highly correlated to advanced stages of disease. Duplicated segments of the LMO1 gene within neuroblastoma tumor cells have been shown to increase the risk of developing an aggressive form of the cancer. Neuroblastoma has been linked to copy-number variation within the NBPF10 gene, which results in the 1q21.1 deletion syndrome or 1q21.1 duplication syndrome. Several risk factors have been proposed and are the subject of ongoing research. Due to characteristic early onset, many studies have focused on parental factors around conception and during gestation. Factors investigated have included occupation (i.e. exposure to chemicals in specific industries), smoking, alcohol consumption, use of medicinal drugs during pregnancy, and birth factors; however, results have been inconclusive. Other studies have examined possible links with atopy and exposure to infection early in life, use of hormones and fertility drugs, and maternal use of hair dye. Diagnosis MRI showing orbital and skull vault metastatic NB in 2-year-old The diagnosis is usually confirmed by a surgical pathologist, taking into account the clinical presentation, microscopic findings, and other laboratory tests. It may arise from any neural crest element of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Esthesioneuroblastoma, also known as olfactory neuroblastoma, is believed to arise from the olfactory epithelium and its classification remains controversial. However, since it is not a sympathetic nervous system malignancy, esthesioneuroblastoma is a distinct clinical entity and is not to be confused with neuroblastoma. =Biochemistry= In about 90% of cases of neuroblastoma, elevated levels of catecholamines or their metabolites are found in the urine or blood. Catecholamines and their metabolites include dopamine, homovanillic acid (HVA), and/or vanillylmandelic acid (VMA). =Imaging= Another way to detect neuroblastoma is the meta-iodobenzylguanidine scan, which is taken up by 90 to 95% of all neuroblastomas, often termed \\"mIBG-avid\\". The mechanism is that mIBG is taken up by sympathetic neurons, and is a functioning analog of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. When it is radio-iodinated with I-131 or I-123 (radioactive iodine isotopes), it is a very good radiopharmaceutical for diagnosis and monitoring of response to treatment for this disease. With a half-life of 13 hours, I-123 is the preferred isotope for imaging sensitivity and quality. I-131 has a half-life of 8 days and at higher doses is an effective therapy as targeted radiation against relapsed and refractory neuroblastoma. As mIBG is not always taken up by neuroblastomas, researchers have explored in children with neuroblastoma whether another type of nuclear imaging, fluoro-deoxy-glucose - positron emission tomography, often termed \\"F-FDG-PET\\", might be useful. Evidence suggests that this might be advisable to use in children with neuroblastoma for which mIBG does not work, but more research is needed in this area. =Histology= Microscopic view of stroma- rich ganglioneuroblastoma On microscopy, the tumor cells are typically described as small, round and blue, and rosette patterns (Homer Wright pseudorosettes) may be seen. Homer Wright pseudorosettes are tumor cells around the neuropil, not to be confused with a true rosettes, which are tumor cells around an empty lumen. They are also distinct from the pseudorosettes of an ependymoma which consist of tumor cells with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)‚Äìpositive processes tapering off toward a blood vessel (thus a combination of the two). A variety of immunohistochemical stains are used by pathologists to distinguish neuroblastomas from histological mimics, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, lymphoma and Wilms' tumor. Neuroblastoma is one of the peripheral neuroblastic tumors (pNTs) that have similar origins and show a wide pattern of differentiation ranging from benign ganglioneuroma to stroma-rich ganglioneuroblastoma with neuroblastic cells intermixed or in nodules, to highly malignant neuroblastoma. This distinction in the pre- treatment tumor pathology is an important prognostic factor, along with age and mitosis-karyorrhexis index (MKI). This pathology classification system (the Shimada system) describes \\"favorable\\" and \\"unfavorable\\" tumors by the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Committee (INPC) which was established in 1999 and revised in 2003. =Staging= The \\"International Neuroblastoma Staging System\\" (INSS) established in 1986 and revised in 1988 stratifies neuroblastoma according to its anatomical presence at diagnosis: *Stage 1: Localized tumor confined to the area of origin. *Stage 2A: Unilateral tumor with incomplete gross resection; identifiable ipsilateral and contralateral lymph node negative for tumor. *Stage 2B: Unilateral tumor with complete or incomplete gross resection; with ipsilateral lymph node positive for tumor; identifiable contralateral lymph node negative for tumor. *Stage 3: Tumor infiltrating across midline with or without regional lymph node involvement; or unilateral tumor with contralateral lymph node involvement; or midline tumor with bilateral lymph node involvement. *Stage 4: Dissemination of tumor to distant lymph nodes, bone marrow, bone, liver, or other organs except as defined by Stage 4S. *Stage 4S: Age <1 year old with localized primary tumor as defined in Stage 1 or 2, with dissemination limited to liver, skin, or bone marrow (less than 10 percent of nucleated bone marrow cells are tumors). Although international agreement on staging (INSS) has been used, the need for an international consensus on risk assignment has also been recognized in order to compare similar cohorts in results of studies. Beginning in 2005, representatives of the major pediatric oncology cooperative groups have met to review data for 8,800 people with neuroblastoma treated in Europe, Japan, USA, Canada, and Australia between 1990 and 2002. This task force has proposed the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system. Retrospective studies revealed the high survival rate of 12‚Äì18 month old age group, previously categorized as high-risk, and prompted the decision to reclassify 12‚Äì18 month old children without N-myc (also commonly referred to as MYCN) amplification to intermediate risk category. The new INRG risk assignment will classify neuroblastoma at diagnosis based on a new International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS): *Stage L1: Localized disease without image-defined risk factors. *Stage L2: Localized disease with image-defined risk factors. *Stage M: Metastatic disease. *Stage MS: Metastatic disease \\"special\\" where MS is equivalent to stage 4S. The new risk stratification will be based on the new INRGSS staging system, age (dichotomized at 18 months), tumor grade, N-myc amplification, unbalanced 11q aberration, and ploidy into four pre-treatment risk groups: very low, low, intermediate, and high risk. Screening Urine catecholamine level can be elevated in pre-clinical neuroblastoma. Screening asymptomatic infants at three weeks, six months, and one year has been performed in Japan, Canada, Austria and Germany since the 1980s. Japan began screening six-month-olds for neuroblastoma via analysis of the levels of homovanillic acid and vanilmandelic acid in 1984. Screening was halted in 2004 after studies in Canada and Germany showed no reduction in deaths due to neuroblastoma, but rather caused an increase in diagnoses that would have disappeared without treatment, subjecting those infants to unnecessary surgery and chemotherapy.Darshak Sanghavi, \\"Screen Alert: How an Ounce of RX Prevention can Cause a Pound of Hurt\\" , Slate magazine, November 28, 2006 Treatment When the lesion is localized, it is generally curable. However, long-term survival for children with advanced disease older than 18 months of age is poor despite aggressive multimodal therapy (intensive chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, stem cell transplant, differentiation agent isotretinoin also called 13-cis-retinoic acid, and frequently immunotherapy with anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody therapy). Biologic and genetic characteristics have been identified, which, when added to classic clinical staging, has allowed assignment to risk groups for planning treatment intensity. These criteria include the age of the person, extent of disease spread, microscopic appearance, and genetic features including DNA ploidy and N-myc oncogene amplification (N-myc regulates microRNAs), into low, intermediate, and high risk disease. A recent biology study (COG ANBL00B1) analyzed 2687 people with neuroblastoma and the spectrum of risk assignment was determined: 37% of neuroblastoma cases are low risk, 18% are intermediate risk, and 45% are high risk. (There is some evidence that the high- and low-risk types are caused by different mechanisms, and are not merely two different degrees of expression of the same mechanism.) The therapies for these different risk categories are very different. * Low-risk disease can frequently be observed without any treatment at all or cured with surgery alone. * Intermediate-risk disease is treated with surgery and chemotherapy. * High-risk neuroblastoma is treated with intensive chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, bone marrow / hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, biological-based therapy with 13-cis- retinoic acid (isotretinoin or Accutane) and antibody therapy usually administered with the cytokines GM-CSF and IL-2. A meta analysis has found evidence that in children with high-risk neuroblastoma, treatment with myeloablative therapy improves event-free survival but may increase the risk of side effects such as kidney problems when compared to conventional chemotherapy. With current treatments, people with low and intermediate risk disease have an excellent prognosis with cure rates above 90% for low risk and 70‚Äì90% for intermediate risk. In contrast, therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma the past two decades resulted in cures only about 30% of the time. The addition of antibody therapy has raised survival rates for high-risk disease significantly. In March 2009 an early analysis of a Children's Oncology Group (COG) study with 226 people that are high-risk showed that two years after stem cell transplant 66% of the group randomized to receive ch14.18 antibody with GM-CSF and IL-2 were alive and disease-free compared to only 46% in the group that did not receive the antibody. The randomization was stopped so all people enrolling on the trial will receive the antibody therapy. Chemotherapy agents used in combination have been found to be effective against neuroblastoma. Agents commonly used in induction and for stem cell transplant conditioning are platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin), alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan), topoisomerase II inhibitor (etoposide), anthracycline antibiotics (doxorubicin) and vinca alkaloids (vincristine). Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and irinotecan) in induction which have been found to be effective against recurrent disease. Prognosis By data from England, the overall 5-year survival rate of neuroblastoma is 67%. Between 20% and 50% of high-risk cases do not respond adequately to induction high-dose chemotherapy and are progressive or refractory. Relapse after completion of frontline therapy is also common. Further treatment is available in phase I and phase II clinical trials that test new agents and combinations of agents against neuroblastoma, but the outcome remains very poor for relapsed high-risk disease. Most long- term survivors alive today had low or intermediate risk disease and milder courses of treatment compared to high-risk disease. The majority of survivors have long-term effects from the treatment. Survivors of intermediate and high- risk treatment often experience hearing loss, growth reduction, thyroid function disorders, learning difficulties, and greater risk of secondary cancers affect survivors of high-risk disease. An estimated two of three survivors of childhood cancer will ultimately develop at least one chronic and sometimes life-threatening health problem within 20 to 30 years after the cancer diagnosis. =Cytogenetic profiles= Based on a series of 493 neuroblastoma samples, it has been reported that overall genomic pattern, as tested by array-based karyotyping, is a predictor of outcome in neuroblastoma: *Tumors presenting exclusively with whole chromosome copy number changes were associated with excellent survival. *Tumors presenting with any kind of segmental chromosome copy number changes were associated with a high risk of relapse. *Within tumors showing segmental alterations, additional independent predictors of decreased overall survival were N-myc amplification, 1p and 11q deletions, and 1q gain. Earlier publications categorized neuroblastomas into three major subtypes based on cytogenetic profiles: *Subtype 1: favorable neuroblastoma with near triploidy and a predominance of numerical gains and losses, mostly representing non-metastatic NB stages 1, 2 and 4S. *Subtypes 2A and 2B: found in unfavorable widespread neuroblastoma, stages 3 and 4, with 11q loss and 17q gain without N-myc amplification (subtype 2A) or with N-myc amplification often together with 1p deletions and 17q gain (subtype 2B). Virtual karyotyping can be performed on fresh or paraffin-embedded tumors to assess copy number at these loci. SNP array virtual karyotyping is preferred for tumor samples, including neuroblastomas, because they can detect copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (acquired uniparental disomy). Copy neutral LOH can be biologically equivalent to a deletion and has been detected at key loci in neuroblastoma. ArrayCGH, FISH, or conventional cytogenetics cannot detect copy neutral LOH. Epidemiology Incidences and prognoses of adrenal tumors,Data and references for pie chart are located at file description page in Wikimedia Commons. with \\"neuronal tumor\\" at right. Neuroblastoma comprises 6‚Äì10% of all childhood cancers, and 15% of cancer deaths in children. The annual mortality rate is 10 per million children in the 0- to 4-year-old age group, and 4 per million in the 4- to 9-year old age group. The highest number of cases is in the first year of life, and some cases are congenital. The age range is broad, including older children and adults, but only 10% of cases occur in people older than 5 years of age. A large European study reported less than 2% of over 4000 neuroblastoma cases were over 18 years old. History Rudolf Virchow: the first to describe an abdominal tumor in a child as a \\"glioma\\" In 1864 German physician Rudolf Virchow was the first to describe an abdominal tumor in a child as a \\"glioma\\". The characteristics of tumors from the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal medulla were then noted in 1891 by German pathologist Felix Marchand. In 1901 the distinctive presentation of stage 4S in infants (liver but no bone metastases) was described by William Pepper. In 1910 James Homer Wright understood the tumor to originate from primitive neural cells, and named it neuroblastoma. He also noted the circular clumps of cells in bone marrow samples which are now termed \\"Homer Wright rosettes\\". Of note, \\"Homer-Wright\\" with a hyphen is grammatically incorrect, as the eponym refers to just Dr. Wright. Society and cultureLegislative efforts= U.S. Representative Chet Edwards of Waco, Texas, successfully introduced legislation to earmark $150 million toward a cure for neuroblastoma and other cancers. The measure was signed into law in July 2008 by U.S. President George W. Bush. Edwards was inspired in the endeavor by the illness and subsequent death of Erin Channing Buenger (1997‚Äì2009) of Bryan, daughter of one of his constituents, Walter L. Buenger, head of the history department at Texas A&M; University. Research Microscopic view of a NB cell line (SH-SY5Y) used in preclinical research for testing new agents =Preclinical models= Neuroblastoma patient derived tumor xenografts (PDXs) have been created by orthotopic implantation of tumor samples into immunodeficient mice. PDX models have several advantages over conventional cancer cell lines (CCL)s. Neuroblastoma PDXs retain the genetic hallmarks of their corresponding tumors and PDXs display infiltrative growth and metastasis to distant organs. PDX models are more predictive of clinical outcome as compared to conventional cancer cell line xenografts. Neuroblastoma PDXs might thus serve as clinically relevant models to identify effective compounds against neuroblastoma. =Treatments= Recent focus has been to reduce therapy for low and intermediate risk neuroblastoma while maintaining survival rates at 90%. A study of 467 people that are at intermediate risk enrolled in A3961 from 1997 to 2005 confirmed the hypothesis that therapy could be successfully reduced for this risk group. Those with favorable characteristics (tumor grade and response) received four cycles of chemotherapy, and those with unfavorable characteristics received eight cycles, with three-year event free survival and overall survival stable at 90% for the entire cohort. Future plans are to intensify treatment for those people with aberration of 1p36 or 11q23 chromosomes as well as for those who lack early response to treatment. By contrast, focus the past 20 years or more has been to intensify treatment for high-risk neuroblastoma. Chemotherapy induction variations, timing of surgery, stem cell transplant regimens, various delivery schemes for radiation, and use of monoclonal antibodies and retinoids to treat minimal residual disease continue to be examined. Recent phase III clinical trials with randomization have been carried out to answer these questions to improve survival of high-risk disease: =Refractory and relapsed neuroblastoma= Chemotherapy with topotecan and cyclophosphamide is frequently used in refractory setting and after relapse. A haploidentical stem cell transplant, that is, donor cells derived from parents, is being studied in those with refractory or relapsing neuroblastoma as stem cells from the person themselves is not useful.

He was member of the Basque Parliament for both Herri Batasuna and Euskal Herritarrok. These two parties and Batasuna were banned in 2003 for having links to ETA which was proscribed as a terrorist group. He was one of the key negotiators during the unsuccessful peace talks in Loiola and Geneva, in 2006. Before joining politics he had been convicted of being an ETA member and taking part in several actions, amongst which was the kidnapping of the businessman Luis Abait√∫a.Detenidos los presuntos secuestradores de Luis Abaitua In the 1990s he started his political career and quickly gained prominence within the Basque separatism movement, becoming the leader of Herri Batasuna in 1997 after its whole National Committee was arrested. However the party was declared illegal in 2003 due to its relationship with ETA. In June 2007 he was convicted of \\"praising terrorism\\",Judicial auto in Spanish (PDF) imprisoned, and then released from prison in August the following year. In October 2009 he was arrested for attempting to put Batasuna back together, and was given a ten-year sentence. In May 2012 his sentence was reduced to 6¬Ω years by the Supreme Court of Spain as they found enough evidence to prove his membership, but not the alleged leadership of ETA. He was chosen as candidate for the post of Lehendakari by EH Bildu for the Basque parliamentary election of 2016 but the electoral committee invalidated its candidacy due to his penal disqualification. Otegi was released from prison on 1 March 2016. In November 2018, the European Court of Humans Rights ruled against Spain for the Spanish National Court's breach of the defendant's right to have an impartial trial, for which he had spent 6 years in prison. Biography Otegi was born on 6 July 1958 in Elgoibar, (Gipuzkoa), in what later would become the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country (Spain). He holds a university degree in philosophy and literature, is married and a father of two children. He was a militant of the abertzale left movement from a young age. In 1977 he fled to the French Basque Country, after the Spanish authorities discovered his membership of ETA (pm), a separatist organization seeking to establish a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Basque state. He was actively involved in several operations and in 1987 the French police arrested him, before allowing him to be extradited to Spain. He was found guilty of taking part in the kidnapping of the Basque entrepreneur Luis Abaitua and was sentenced to six years in prison. He spent three years imprisoned and was released in 1990. On leaving prison he decided to change how he would seek Basque independence and so entered politics. In the Basque parliamentary election in 1994 he was the seventh placed candidate on the party list of Herri Batasuna (HB) for Gipuzkoa. HB won six seats at the election with Otegi initially failing to be elected, but, on 27 September 1995, he became a member of the Basque Parliament when he substituted a party colleague. In November 1997 the Spanish Supreme Court found 23 senior members of Herri Batasuna guilty of collaboration with ETA, jailing them for seven years, and in the resulting power vacuum Joseba Permach and Arnaldo Otegi were chosen to become the new provisional leadership of Herri Batasuna. The sentence was overturned by the Spanish Constitutional Court in 1999. Since then Otegi has been the major spokesman for the movement, first in Herri Batasuna, later in Euskal Herritarrok and finally in Batasuna. =Lizarra-Garazi Agreements= Otegi played a key role in the formulation of what would be known as the Lizarra- Garazi Agreements or \\"Declaration of Estella-Lizarra\\". This agreement was signed on 12 September 1998 in Estella-Lizarra by every political party linked to Basque nationalism in the Southern Basque Country, and Ezker Batua (EB), the Basque branch of the Spanish Izquierda Unida (United Left).Acuerdo de Lizarra, Especial El Mundo, El Mundo These groups worked together under the understanding that \\"discussions would only take place while there was a total absence of all expressions of violence connected to the conflict\\". This agreement proposed a common position on the defense of Basque self- determination. In the chapter Keys to the resolution it says: > \\"A resolution will not involve any specific impositions, will respect the > plurality of Basque society, will place every project on equal terms, will > deepen democracy in the sense of giving to the citizens of the Basque > Country the last word on the shaping of their future, and that their > decision should be respected by the countries involved. The Basque Country > should have the final word and the decision.\\" ETA declared an \\"indefinite ceasefire\\" four days later,ETA declara una tregua indefinida, El Mundo the second in the history of the organization. The conservative Spanish president Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar stated he had authorized direct contacts with ETAAznar confirma la reuni√≥n entre el Gobierno y ETA hace tres semanas (7 June 1999), El Mundo and he publicly called ETA a \\"Movimiento Vasco de Liberaci√≥n\\" (Basque liberation movement). He also moved 135 Basque prisoners to prisons closer to the Basque Country.El Gobierno de Aznar acerc√≥ a 135 presos de ETA antes del di√°logo, El Pa√≠s This claim made by the Spanish Government and some Spanish media was refuted by the Basque prisoners' family association Etxerat, which revealed that a similar or higher number of prisoners were being transferred farther away. The Spanish police continued arresting people and the negotiations never got very far. Meanwhile, in the Basque parliamentary election in 1998, Arnaldo Otegi stood and won as a candidate for Euskal Herritarrok, in the constituency of Gipuzkoa. The Lizarra-Garazi agreements helped give Euskal Herritarrok their best electoral results in ten years, and they became the third-largest political party in Basque Country and the adjacent region of Navarre. This popularity in terms of votes was reversed when in 1999 ETA decided to end the ceasefire, and, in 2000, killed Pedro Antonio Blanco. ETA blamed the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) for not implementing the Lizarra-Garazi agreements, and the PNV blamed ETA. The cessation of the ceasefire was condemned by every signatory to the Lizarra-Garazi agreements with the exception of Herri Batasuna. This refusal to condemn violence brought the agreements to an end. = Glorifying terrorism charges = Interview with Arnaldo Otegi (English subtitles) In August 2000, a senior Basque court accused him of \\"glorifying terrorism\\", after he allegedly shouted \\"Gora Euskadi ta Askatasuna!\\" (\\"Up Euskadi and freedom!\\"), in France in reference to ETA who were banned as a terrorist group by the Spanish and French governments. However, the Spanish Supreme Court closed the case, stating that crimes such as \\"glorifying terrorism\\" could not be pursued if committed abroad. El Supremo no actuar√° contra Otegi porque vitore√≥ a ETA fuera de Espa√±a, El Pa√≠s, 28 May 2002 This precedent was then called forth by the Audiencia Nacional concerning the Carmelo Soria case.Archivan el caso del asesinato de Carmelo Soria en Chile por el precedente de Otegi, El Pa√≠s, 31 May 2002 In May 2005 Arnaldo Otegi was put on trial for belonging to ETA, but was released after posting bail for ‚Ç¨400,000. Shortly afterwards, a Spanish Supreme Court ruling confirmed the 15-month prison sentence against Otegi for \\"glorifying terrorism\\" in a case brought against him for a speech he had given in 2003 in commemoration of the killing of a prominent ETA member 25 years previously. He appealed the sentence, but a panel of judges unanimously rejected the appeal. Meanwhile, in November 2005, Otegi was sentenced to a year in prison, on charges of slander against King Juan Carlos during a 2003 news conference. Otegi had then stated that the King was the \\"chief of the Spanish army, that's to say, the person responsible for the torturers, who favour torture and impose his monarchic regime on our people through torture and violence\\".Basque convicted for king insult, BBC News, 4 November 2005 On 27 April 2006 he was sentenced to 15 months in prison for the ongoing \\"glorifying terrorism\\" case. He started serving the sentence on 8 June 2007 Basque leader arrested in Spain, BBC News, 8 June 2007 and was released from prison in August 2008. 2009-2016 arrestCase Bateragune and further indictments= On 16 October 2009, Otegi and several other Batasuna members were arrested and put to trial for their participation in the discussion that would pave the way for ETA's permanent ceasefire. Whilst awaiting sentence he started a hunger strike, on 27 January 2010, but stopped it soon after. In March 2010 the Spanish court sentenced Otegi to two years in prison for \\"glorifying terrorism\\" in a speech he gave in 2005 in which he compared an imprisoned ETA member to Nelson Mandela. He was also barred from holding public office for sixteen years. In September 2010 Otegi again faced trial for glorifying terrorism, this time at a November 2004 rally held in the Anoeta Velodrome in San Sebasti√°n. However, he was found not guilty by the Spanish National Court, which ruled that Otegi did not praise ETA, but was defending \\"peaceful coexistence and the need for a process of dialogue and negotiation in order to resolve the conflict in a non-violent and democratic way\\". However, in September 2011 Otegi was found guilty of the initial charge, of trying to rebuild Batasuna, and sentenced to ten years imprisonment. On 9 May 2012 his sentence was reduced to 6¬Ω years by the Supreme Court of Spain as they found enough evidence to prove his membership, but not his leadership of the organization. He was elected Secretary General of abertzale Basque separatist party Sortu in February 2013.Basques from Spain, France launch new ‚Äòindependence‚Äô party =Campaign for release= On 24 March 2015, a campaign for Arnaldo Otegi's release was launched in the European Parliament by Basque musician Fermin Muguruza who read out the \\"International Declaration to Free Otegi and to bring Basque Political Prisoners home\\". The declaration was endorsed by 24 international personalities, including Desmond Tutu, Adolfo P√©rez Esquivel and Jos√© Mujica. Otegi was released from prison on 1 March 2016, after six years in prison. =Ruling of the European Court of Human Rights= In November 2018, the European Court of Human Rights condemned Spain for breaching the defendants right to an impartial trial he did not have. As Arnaldo Otegi declared: > \\"They lied, they fabricated a fake allegation, they incarcerated us, we > served the term... We got incarcerated for designing a peaceful strategy. > Now their big lie gets exposed. Our smile is broader, and Spain gets back > the portrait of what it is, an antidemocratic state.\\" The president of the Basque Autonomous Community I√±igo Urkullu declared that it is \\"about time to stop tampering with the judiciary in order to condition politics\\". The incumbent president of Catalonia Quim Torra considered that \\"Spanish Justice has been taken to task once again\\". The president of Navarre Uxue Barkos also declared that \\"Spanish Justice gets a setback yet again, for which certain circles should rethink their ways\\".

The linker peptides are shown as arrows. A single-chain variable fragment (scFv) is not actually a fragment of an antibody, but instead is a fusion protein of the variable regions of the heavy (VH) and light chains (VL) of immunoglobulins, connected with a short linker peptide of ten to about 25 amino acids. The linker is usually rich in glycine for flexibility, as well as serine or threonine for solubility, and can either connect the N-terminus of the VH with the C-terminus of the VL, or vice versa. This protein retains the specificity of the original immunoglobulin, despite removal of the constant regions and the introduction of the linker. The image to the right shows how this modification usually leaves the specificity unaltered. These molecules were created to facilitate phage display, where it is highly convenient to express the antigen-binding domain as a single peptide. As an alternative, scFv can be created directly from subcloned heavy and light chains derived from a hybridoma. ScFvs have many uses, e.g., flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and as antigen-binding domains of artificial T cell receptors (chimeric antigen receptor). Unlike monoclonal antibodies, which are often produced in mammalian cell cultures, scFvs are more often produced in bacteria cell cultures such as E. coli. Purification Single-chain variable fragments lack the constant Fc region found in complete antibody molecules, and, thus, the common binding sites (e.g., protein G) cannot be used to purify antibodies. These fragments can often be purified or immobilized using protein L, since protein L interacts with the variable region of kappa light chains. More commonly, scientists incorporate a six histidine tag on the c-terminus of the scFv molecule and purify them using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Some scFv can also be captured by protein A if they contain a human VH3 domain. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9186782-staphylococcal-protein-a-binding-to- vh3-encoded-immunoglobulins/ Bivalent and trivalent scFvs Structure of divalent (top) and trivalent (bottom) scFvs, tandem (left) and di-/trimerisation format (right) Divalent (or bivalent) single-chain variable fragments (di-scFvs, bi-scFvs) can be engineered by linking two scFvs. This can be done by producing a single peptide chain with two VH and two VL regions, yielding tandem scFvs. Another possibility is the creation of scFvs with linker peptides that are too short for the two variable regions to fold together (about five amino acids), forcing scFvs to dimerize. This type is known as diabodies. Diabodies have been shown to have dissociation constants up to 40-fold lower than corresponding scFvs, meaning that they have a much higher affinity to their target. Consequently, diabody drugs could be dosed much lower than other therapeutic antibodies and are capable of highly specific targeting of tumors in vivo. Still shorter linkers (one or two amino acids) lead to the formation of trimers, so-called triabodies or tribodies. Tetrabodies have also been produced. They exhibit an even higher affinity to their targets than diabodies. All of these formats can be composed from variable fragments with specificity for two different antigens, in which case they are types of bispecific antibodies. The furthest developed of these are bispecific tandem di-scFvs, known as bi-specific T-cell engagers (BiTE antibody constructs). Examples * Pexelizumab, a scFv binding to component 5 of the complement system and designed to reduce side effects of cardiac surgery * C6.5, a diabody targeting HER2/neu found in some breast cancers * Brolucizumab, a scFV binding to VEGF-A and used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration References .

The attack was the largest by Barbary pirates on either Ireland or Great Britain.http://www.baltimore.ie/heritage-history/the-sack-of- baltimore-1631.html The attack was led by a Dutch captain, Jan Janszoon van Haarlem, also known as Murad Reis the Younger. Murad's force was led to the village by a man called Hackett, the captain of a fishing boat he had captured earlier, in exchange for his freedom. Hackett was subsequently hanged from the clifftop outside the village for conspiracy. Attack Murad's crew, made up of Dutchmen, Algerians and Ottoman Turks, launched their covert attack on the remote village on 20 June 1631. They captured 107 villagers, mostly English settlers along with some local Irish people (some reports put the number as high as 237). The attack was focused on the area of the village known to this day as the Cove. The villagers were put in irons and taken to a life of slavery in North Africa. Conspiracy theories There are conspiracy theories relating to the raid. It has been suggested that Sir Walter Coppinger, a prominent Catholic lawyer and member of the leading Cork family, who had become the dominant power in the area after the death of Sir Thomas Crooke, 1st Baronet, the founder of the English colony, orchestrated the raid to gain control of the village from the local Gaelic chieftain, Sir Fineen O'Driscoll. It was O'Driscoll who had licensed the lucrative pilchard fishery in Baltimore to the English settlers. Suspicion also points to O'Driscoll's exiled relatives, who had fled to Spain after the Battle of Kinsale, and had no hope of inheriting Baltimore by legal means. On the other hand, Murad may have planned the raid without any help; it is known that the authorities had advance intelligence of a planned raid on the Cork coast, although Kinsale was thought to be a more likely target than Baltimore.  Aftermath  Some prisoners were destined to live out their days as galley slaves, rowing for decades without ever setting foot on shore while others would spend long years in harem or as labourers. At most three of them ever returned to Ireland. One was ransomed almost at once and two others in 1646. In the aftermath of the raid, the remaining villagers moved to Skibbereen, and Baltimore was virtually deserted for generations. In popular culture * The incident inspired Thomas Davis to write his famous poem, The Sack of Baltimore. Evidently, Davis thought that the enslaved were O'Driscolls rather than planters who displaced them.\\"And when to die a death of fire that noble maid they bore, She only smiled, O‚ÄôDriscoll‚Äôs child; she thought of Baltimore.\\" * A detailed account of the sack of Baltimore can be found in the book The Stolen Village: Baltimore and the Barbary Pirates by Des Ekin. * In 1999, the raid on Baltimore was portrayed in a screenplay titled Roaring Water, The Sack of Baltimore, by Irish screenwriter Sean Boyle. * In 2014, Chris Bolister set the saga to music in \\"The Ballad (Sack) of Baltimore,\\" written from the perspective of the captured James Rooney.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mC70WvEdz4 * In 2015, the raid inspired the song \\"Roaring Waters\\" from the album Last of Our Kind by British hard rock band The Darkness. The band were inspired to write the song after hearing of the incident while on Valentia Island, approximately 50 miles from Baltimore. * In 2018, singer/songwriter Tim O'Riordan commemorated the raid in the song Sail Away To Barbary on the album Taibhse.

Through press releases, lobbying and leafleting the group has promoted a number of rail projects, including the proposed DART Underground. The group is a member of the European Passengers' Federation a European level representative body.  History and organisation  Platform 11 was founded in January 2003 at a public meeting held in Dublin As well as making the case for expanded commuter services in the Greater Dublin Area, the group has advocated suburban rail for Galway and Limerick if combined with a focused planning environment such as the Cork LUTS (Land Use and Transportation Study). They also advocate bus services connecting to railheads where rail is not feasible. They also support direct rather than connecting services to Clonmel.  Projects  The group has expressed opinions or lobbied in relation to a number of rail projects in Ireland. In relation to the proposed Dublin Metro, while supportive of the concept in principle, Rail Users Ireland expressed concerns that the original plans offered \\"insufficient interconnections\\" with other parts of the rail network. In the early planning phases of the Luas project, Platform 11 raised doubts about the Railway Procurement Agency's assertion that 40-metre trams were not necessary on the red line to Tallaght. The Railway Procurement Agency have since ordered the 10-metre sections to bring all 30-metre trams to 40-metre length as well as to commence work on the depot at Red Cow to accommodate an enlarged fleet. In relation to the Western Railway Corridor proposals, Rail Users Ireland took the view that it would only support projects they deemed viable. The Western Rail Corridor had support from other groups and politicians in the Mayo, Galway and Clare areas, and a considerable political profile in the West of Ireland, albeit with no meaningful follow- through such as local council planning. Supporters of the Western Railway Corridor project were angered that Rail Users Ireland opposed the project on cost grounds.  Criticisms  Rail Users Ireland are very critical of Irish Rail, the RPA (rail procurement agency) and the Irish Government, within the context of service provision, implementation of new projects and interference in the planning and development of rail transport based transport projects. Rail Users Ireland has changed policy positions dramatically since its formation in 2003 when it supported the Western Rail Corridor, opposed the Interconnector project and attacked Irish Rail for concentrating development resources in the Pale. It now claims to favour the sections of the Western Railway Corridor from Ennis to Tuam which are about to be rebuilt.

At only in length, it once had the distinction of being the shortest signed Interstate Highway in the country. It is the southernmost leg of the Walter P. Chrysler Freeway and a spur of I-75 into downtown Detroit, ending at the unsigned Business Spur Interstate 375 (BS I-375), better known as Jefferson Avenue. The freeway opened on June 12, 1964. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) announced in 2013 that it may remove I-375 in the future. Route description I-375 and the Chrysler Freeway begin at Jefferson Avenue between St. Antoine Street and Beaubien Street in downtown Detroit near the Renaissance Center. They run east before turning north. Just about a mile (1.6 km) after the southern terminus, I-375 meets the Fisher Freeway which carries I-75 north of downtown. At this interchange, I-75 takes ramps to leave the Fisher Freeway and use the Chrysler Freeway, replacing I-375. I-375 is a four-lane freeway south of the I-75 interchange, where it widens to six lanes. The entire length of I-375 is included on the National Highway System, a network of roadways that are important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. According to the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), I-375 is . At the time it opened until at least 2007, I-375 was the shortest signed Interstate in the country. Based on FHWA data, there are three Interstates that are shorter: I-110 in Texas (), I-878 in New York () and I-315 in Montana (). The latter two designations are not signed on their respective roadways, *\\"Montana\\" (Map). 1:190,080. pp. 60‚Äì1.

Every year, MDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. In 2009, MDOT calculated that 14,112 vehicles per day used the southernmost section of I-375, on average, and 53,900 vehicles used the northernmost section near I-75. These vehicles included 798 trucks. History Construction on the first segments of the Chrysler Freeway started on January 30, 1959. The area where the freeway was built was called Black Bottom, a historic district that received its name from the soil found there by French explorers. In the 1940s and 1950s, the area was home to a community of African-American entrepreneurs and businesses that rivaled Harlem in New York City. Black Bottom was one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city, and at the time of freeway construction, it had wooden sewers and dilapidated buildings. In the 1950s and 1960s, many lower-class African-American residents lived in overcrowded and run-down housing in Black Bottom. These residents could not afford to maintain their homes because of their low income, leading outsiders to view the area as neglected and in need of updating and development. The area, like Corktown to the west of downtown, was targeted by urban planners for urban renewal and infrastructure improvements in the 1950s and 1960s, which included the Chrysler Freeway and public housing projects. On June 12, 1964, a surface street highway/freeway in Detroit that ran north from Jefferson Avenue and Randolph Street to the Fisher/Chrysler freeway interchange was opened. The southernmost segment, built through the Black Bottom neighborhood, was designated I-375 at this time. The freeway cost $50 million to build (equivalent to $ in ). In April 2013, MDOT announced that it was studying whether to repair the freeway at a cost of $80 million or convert the freeway south of Gratiot Avenue into a boulevard to reduce maintenance cost. This change would make the area more pedestrian-friendly and bring new developers and residents into the neighborhood. Converting this segment of the freeway and its right-of-way to a boulevard would free up of land for development. The department invited businesses and other groups affected by the potential project to participate in the study in November 2013. Advocates of the conversion cite increased pedestrian access and an improved connection between Eastern Market and downtown as reasons to remove the freeway. Also, because the freeway has outdated geometric conditions, such as ramp widths and curvature, the high crash rates and congestion of I-375 are used to support the freeway's removal. Some people who live or work along the freeway and in the downtown area note the improved access I-375 provides to the area as reasons to retain the freeway. Six alternative proposals for rebuilding I-375 were unveiled by MDOT in June 2014. They ranged in price from $40 million to $80 million. These options included rebuilding the freeway as is, reducing it to a boulevard or multiple one-way streets, or upgrading the existing freeway right-of-way to include bike lanes and other pedestrian-friendly features. In January 2016, the department announced that any decision on a course of action would be delayed indefinitely. However, in May 2017, MDOT announced it was going forward with an environmental assessment to identify a preferred alternative. In December 2017, the department announced that they were down to two alternatives, both of which involved replacing the freeway with a boulevard. Both alternatives presented included a four-lane surface boulevard between Gratiot Avenue and Atwater Street. As of September 2019, planning efforts for the conversion of I-375 into a surface street are ongoing.

It is also designated as the unsigned State Road 592. There is a sibling segment of freeway nearby that is designated I-175. Route description Interstate 375 begins at an interchange with Interstate 275 (exit 23), heading east towards downtown St. Petersburg, with interchanges with 8th Street North/9th Street North, before ending at 4th Avenue North west of 4th Street North. Westbound I-375 begins with a split of 5th Avenue North west of 4th Street North with no exits until reaching I-275. Along with its sister highway I-175, I-375 lacks exit numbers. HistoryOriginal aspirations= Interstate 375 was originally planned as a much longer, state highway, extending west of Interstate 275 and following a CSX rail line towards a proposed toll road near Clearwater. When I-75 was relocated in the late 1970s/early 1980s, five miles (8 km) of additional interstate became available, thus the St. Pete feeder sections of I-375 and the neighboring I-175 were upgraded to Interstate status. However, the Interstate Highway standards at the time would not allow the I-375 extension to receive Federal Interstate Highway funding, leaving only the section east of I-275 built to freeway standards. The planned freeway extension of I-375 was canceled by officials at the Department of Transportation in the mid 1970s. The cancellation of the rest of Interstate 375 eventually resulted in US 19 between Gandy Boulevard and the Pinellas- Pasco line being upgraded to freeway standards. Contrary to popular belief, the ramp stub at the I-375 interchange was not a result of the failed freeway extension. A connection to 20th St N was originally planned from this stub. However, the 20th St N and 5th Ave N Intersection was already convoluted prior to I-275's construction and the Florida Department of Transportation decided not to build the connection as a result. =2007 tanker incident= The I-275/I-375 junction during reconstruction of the damaged flyover (left) On March 28, 2007, a tanker entering I-375 east from I-275 south's left exit lost control and hit the retaining wall, catching fire and burning for several hours. The resulting fire became so intense, that it severely damaged a large section of the I-375 overpass from southbound I-275. Intense flames also fell to a city-owned (St. Petersburg) construction equipment yard and destroyed 8 to 10 city vehicles, causing an estimated $500,000 in damage to the yard. The fire also spread to St. Petersburg's stormwater system, blowing off manhole covers within the vicinity. One St. Petersburg police officer was injured as a result being struck by one of those manhole covers. In the end, the driver of the tanker died on-scene due to the fire. The I-375 overpass remained closed for almost four weeks while Florida Department of Transportation rebuilt the damaged sections of the bridge, reopening to traffic on the morning of April 22, 2007, about one week ahead of schedule. Reconstruction of the I-375 overpass included the rebuilding of one entire span, plus 11 concrete beams. In addition, one of the support columns underwent significant repairs to ensure its strength in supporting the roadway. FDOT placed signs along I-275 south, indicating the left exit onto I-375, due to this, as well as other fatal incidents that have occurred on the interchange.

He operated a number of businesses in the eastern part of the province and was one of its most prominent citizens.  Early life  Snowball came to the Miramichi Valley from Lunenburg, Nova Scotia when his father, a Methodist Minister, answered a call to St. Luke's Church in Chatham. Snowball attended Wesleyan Academy in Sackville, New Brunswick, and was dissuaded by his family from going to California to seek his fortune.  Entrepreneur  Snowball started his working life as a clerk in a dry goods store in Chatham, owned by John MacDougall whose daughter Margaret he married. When MacDougall died in 1866, Snowball, at the age of 27, took over the business and expanded it. In 1871, he was a founder of the Miramichi Steam Navigation Company which soon built and operated six small steamers on the river. On his own account he purchased and operated several others. The next year he built the largest steam sawmill in the Province, milling some 170,000 board feet (400 m¬≥) of lumber per day. He soon opened sawmills in Tracadie, Bay du Vin and Red Bank, operating a grist mill in the last community as well. Fish attracted his attention as well, and soon Snowball had canneries on Shippegan Island and Miscou Island. In 1879, he sent 200,000 lb. of lobster to the United Kingdom. Snowball was a tough master, hard working and expecting the same from all his employees. He vigorously put down any attempts to unionize.  Magnate  By the 1880s, Snowball was the second largest exporter of lumber in New Brunswick, and employed 1,000 men in his various enterprises. In 1886, Snowball constructed the Chatham Branch Railway connecting the town with the Intercolonial Railway some six miles away. Along with Alexander Gibson, Snowball constructed an extension of the railway to Gibson, N.B., some 95 miles away. In 1893, he sold his interest to Gibson. In 1887, he was a founding member of the Chatham Telephone Exchange which was later expanded into nearby Kent, Gloucester and Restigouche counties. This enterprise was sold in 1905 to the Central Telephone Company. Next was the Chatham Electric Light Company, founded in 1888.  Political life  He represented his area in the House of Commons of Canada as a member of the Liberal Party of Canada from 1878 to 1882. After a period in the Senate of Canada, he served from 1902 - 1907 as Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick. Snowball was active in securing incorporation for the town of Chatham, and when he ran to be its first mayor in 1896, he was defeated by a local doctor by two votes.  Local Grandee  Snowball and his wife (called \\"Lady Snowball\\" by the locals) maintained a splendid town residence called \\"Wellington Villa\\" at the town's most important intersection, and lived in great style, often entertaining with many servants and fine furniture.  Legacy  Snowball died in 1907 at the age of 69, a wealthy and influential man. But, changing fortunes and a lack of the same great entrepreneurial flair in the next generation prevented a dynasty being established. His businesses were divided among his children and gradually frittered away. Snowball's mill in Chatham was caught up in the postwar depression of 1919 and closed.

Another king of the Second Intermediate Period bears the name Dedumose: Djedneferre Dedumose II. Given the rarity of the name Dedumose, it is possible that he was the son of Dedumose I. A number of artefacts name a king Dedumose but without providing the prenomen, it is difficult to decide to which Dedumose they belong.K. S. B. Ryholt: The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, c. 1800 - 1550 BC. Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press. , p. 402 For example, a stela of an official Harsekher from Edfu states that the King's Son Harsekher, son of the King's Son Sobekhotep is related to a king Dedumose, which Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton identify as Dedumose I.  Chronological position  Precise dates for Dedumose are unknown, but if he was a king of the 13th Dynasty, his reign probably ended around 1690 BC while if he was a king of the 16th Dynasty, he would possibly have reigned between 1588 BC and 1582 BC, in the final years of the 16th Dynasty. Ryholt believes that facing the invasion of his territory by the Hyksos, Dedumose tried to sue them for peace, as indicated by his names \\"The peace of Ra is stable; He who brings peace; He who rescues the Two Lands\\".

It contains the Admonitions of Ipuwer, an incomplete literary work whose original composition is dated no earlier than the late Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt (c.1991‚Äì1803 BCE).  Content  In the poem, Ipuwer ‚Äì a name typical of the period 1850‚Äì1450 BCE ‚Äì complains that the world has been turned upside-down: a woman who had not a single box now has furniture, a girl who looked at her face in the water now owns a mirror, while the once-rich man is now in rags. He demands that the Lord of All (a title which can be applied both to the king and to the creator sun-god) should destroy his enemies and remember his religious duties. This is followed by a violent description of disorder: there is no longer any respect for the law and even the king's burial inside the pyramid has been desecrated. The story continues with the description of better days until it abruptly ends due to the missing final part of the papyrus. It is likely that the poem concluded with a reply of the Lord of All, or prophesying the coming of a powerful king who would restore order.  Discussion  The Ipuwer Papyrus has been dated no earlier than the Nineteenth Dynasty, around 1250 BCE but it is now agreed that the text itself is much older, and dated back to the Middle Kingdom, though no earlier than the late Twelfth Dynasty. The Admonitions is considered the world's earliest known treatise on political ethics, suggesting that a good king is one who controls unjust officials, thus carrying out the will of the gods. It is a textual lamentation, close to Sumerian city laments and to Egyptian laments for the dead, using the past (the destruction of Memphis at the end of the Old Kingdom) as a gloomy backdrop to an ideal future. It was previously thought that the Admonitions of Ipuwer presents an objective portrait of Egypt in the First Intermediate Period. In more recent times, it was found that the Admonitions, along with the Complaints of Khakheperraseneb, are most likely works of royal propaganda, both inspired by the earlier Prophecy of Neferti: the three compositions have in common the theme of a nation that has been plunged into chaos and disarray and the need for an intransigent king who would defeat chaos and restore maat. Toby Wilkinson suggested that the Admonitions and Khakheperresenb may thus have been composed during the reign of Senusret III, a pharaoh well known for his use of propaganda. In any case, the Admonitions is not a reliable account of early Egyptian history, because of the long time interval between its original composition and the writing of the Leiden Papyrus.  Ipuwer and the Book of Exodus  Ipuwer has often been put forward in popular literature as confirmation of the biblical account of the Exodus, most notably because of its statement that \\"the river is blood\\" and its frequent references to servants running away. However, these arguments ignore the multitude of ways in which Ipuwer differs from Exodus, such as that it describes the Asiatics as arriving in Egypt rather than leaving, and that the \\"river is blood\\" phrase may refer to the red sediment colouring the Nile during disastrous floods, or simply be a poetic image of turmoil. Most histories do not consider information about the Exodus to be recoverable or even relevant to the story of the emergence of Israel.

Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians (pronounced \\"Soo Saint Marie\\"), commonly shortened to Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians or the more colloquial Soo Tribe, is a federally recognized Native American tribe in what is now known as Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The tribal headquarters is located within Sault Ste. Marie, the major city in the region, which is located on the St. Marys River. This location was known as Bawating by Chippewa (the Ojibwe or Anishinabeg) residents of the region, who had been there well before Europeans arrived as explorers and colonists in the mid-to-late 16th century. Bawating, sometimes seen written as Bahweting, is an Ojibwe word meaning \\"The Gathering Place.\\" The Chippewa participated in trading with other tribes, and later with the French, British and American traders here in turn. The Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians is the largest federally recognized tribe in Michigan, outnumbering the next largest tribes by a scale of about 10 to one. It was recognized in 1972 with five units in seven counties. In 1979 the tribal council included the Mackinac Band as members, nearly doubling its enrollment. The tribe's revenues from its Kewadin Casinos has enabled it to establish health centers and invest in education for its members. Government The Sault Tribe operates its own government, with regular elections for chairperson and council members. Council members represent the tribe's five units throughout seven counties in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Over one half of the tribe's enrolled members reside outside the five units, but vote within those established units. They vote in a unit where they have significant ancestral or historic ties. In 2012 the current chairman Aaron A. Payment was elected by the largest majority in the tribe's modern history. He had first been elected to the Tribal Council in 1996. He was elected as chairman in 2004, defeating a 17-year incumbent. In 2008 he lost his race for re-election to Joe Eitrem, but was re-elected in 2012, 2016 and 2020.Melissa Anders, \\"2013 Michiganders to Watch: Aaron Payment, Sault Tribe chairman handling casino expansions\\", Mlive.com, December 2012, accessed 24 December 2015 The tribe operates its own police department and tribal court. History For hundreds of years preceding modern European contact, the Sault (Soo) Band ancestors were part of the large Lake Superior Band of Chippewa Indians. The Ojibwe (known as Chippewa in the United States) were known to have migrated over centuries from the Atlantic Coast. They historically spoke the Ojibwe language, one of numerous Algonquian languages. Chiefs whose signatories identified them as members of the Sault (Soo) Band and other bands were among those in the region signing treaties with the United States in 1820. Ancestors of the tribe are believed to have lived in the Great Lakes region since about 1200CE. They were part of a wide trading network. The modern Sault Tribe is descended from Ojibwe ancestors who lived on Sugar Island in the St. Mary's River between the U.S. state of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario, and in the area. The Sault Tribe gained federal recognition by the United States Commissioner of Indian Affairs on September 7, 1972. The tribe did not have a historic reservation from a previous treaty. As part of the process, the federal government took land in trust for the tribe by deed dated May 17, 1973, and approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs on March 7, 1974. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs formally declared the trust land to be a reservation for the tribe on February 20, 1975, with notice published in the Federal Register on February 27, 1975. The reservation land is located in both the city of Sault Ste. Marie and in Sugar Island Township, on Sugar Island (Sugar Island part at ) east of the city. Enrollment Since formal recognition in 1972, the tribe has increased in number of members. It has approximately 40,000 members on its rolls. In the 21st century, many Sault Tribe members live off-reservation in the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of Michigan, about one third live throughout the United States and Canada, and on other continents. At any given time, significant numbers are serving in the military. In 1979 the Tribal Council passed a resolution allowing Mackinac Band members to enroll in the tribe, which doubled the number of enrolled members. In the 21st century, the Sault Tribe consists of more than 20 bands. There is also a significant and historic relation with Garden River First Nation, also known as Ketegaunseebee (Gitigaan-ziibi Anishinaabe in the Ojibwe language), an Ojibwa band located at Garden River 14 near Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada. Several thousand Mackinac Band members continue to work to gain independent federal recognition. They have formed the Mackinac Bands of Chippewa and Ottawa Indians, which is state recognized.\\"Michigan Historic Tribes\\", STATE OF MICHIGAN COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT (CSBG); STATE PLAN FOR FISCAL YEARS 2015 -2016, Draft 2014, p. 67 Economic development Based on a 1993 compact with the state, the tribe operates five casinos under the Kewadin Casinos name in Sault Ste. Marie, St. Ignace, Manistique, Christmas and Hessel. The tribe also owns and manages hotels at the Sault Ste. Marie and St. Ignace casino sites. These tribal enterprises operate at a profit, generating revenues for the tribe. The tribe formerly operated Detroit's Greektown Casino, where they held a majority interest. They filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008, during the Great Recession. In June 2010 the Michigan Gaming Control Board voted 4-0 at a special meeting to transfer ownership from the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians to new investors.\\"Sault Tribe loses grip on Greektown Casino\\" , Soo Evening News The tribe's participation in the Greektown Casino created state support for authorization of three casinos in Detroit. These have provided the region and state with employment and income. In 2011 the tribe said it was considering development of additional downstate casinos in Romulus and the state capital of Lansing., The News Herald, 12 March 2011 These were proposed to be built on land the tribe owned but which had not yet been put in trust by the federal government. Both projects were challenged in court cases. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette contended that the Lansing project violated the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act and the 1993 compact which the tribe had made with Gov. John Engler when it established its first casinos. In September 2015 a judge dismissed the state's lawsuit seeking to block a casino in downtown Lansing.John Agar, \\"Casino in downtown Lansing closer after judge rejects state's lawsuit, backers say\\", Mlive.com, 16 September 2015, accessed 24 December 2015 The mayor of Lansing has publicly supported the project, saying that the casino \\"would bring thousands of good-paying jobs to Lansing and fully fund the Lansing Promise to provide college scholarships for graduates of the city's schools.\\" The casino is proposed to be built next to the Lansing Center, blocks from the state capitol building. The Department of Interior will take the land into trust which the Sault Tribe bought from Lansing. Services The tribe has reinvested revenues from the casino/hotel operations to build infrastructure for the welfare and education of its people. It operates six health centers for its members, with locations in Sault Ste. Marie, St. Ignace, Manistique, Munising, Newberry, and Hessel., Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians The tribe also has emphasized education for its youth, offering several college scholarships for members. The tribe helped found the Joseph K. Lumsden Bahweting Anishnaabe Public School Academy in Sault Ste. Marie.\\"Joseph K. Lumsden School\\", School Wires This is operated independently as both a Bureau of Indian Affairs school and a Michigan charter school. It was founded to offer an alternative to public schools, from which Chippewa students had a high drop-out rate. The school was renamed in 1998 to honor Lumsden, a late tribal leader who helped develop the tribe's first housing, education, and health programs. Open to all students in the community, Bahweting has achieved progress. It offers an introduction to the Anishnaabe language, culture and values. The school was awarded the Governor of Michigan's Gold Apple Award for outstanding student performance in the ‚ÄòMost Improved‚Äô category on the Michigan Education Assessment Program (MEAP) tests. The U.S. Department of Education gave it a Title I Distinguished School Award; it was one of 95 schools honored among the 48,000 Title I schools nationwide.JKL Bahweting, Sault Tribe official website Other tribal endeavors include building the Chi Mukwa (Big Bear) Recreation Center in Sault Ste.

The Tribe publishes a monthly newspaper, Win Awenen Nisitotung, which in Ojibwe means \\"he/she/or one, who well or fully understands.\\" The newspaper is commonly referred to as the WAN. The tribe operates two Midjim convenience stores, one in Sault Ste. Marie and the other located in St. Ignace. These offer discounted gasoline and cigarettes for tribal members.

It was built in 1925, from a kit fabricated in England by David Rowell & Co., in order to shorten the distance sheep needed to be driven from southern Lafonia to the shearing sheds in Goose Green.  Background  A bridge across Bodie Creek was first proposed in 1922 as part of an effort to centralise the Falkland Islands Company (FIC) Lafonia sheep farming operations at Goose Green which consolidated the shearing of flocks from nearby farms including Darwin and Walker Creek. A bridge was required to allow the sheep raised at Walker Creek to be herded to Goose Green, avoiding a lengthy and arduous detour around Bodie Creek, an inlet of Choiseul Sound. The FIC approved the proposals at a meeting on 31 March 1924.  Construction  The bridge was purchased by the FIC for ¬£2,281 () from David Rowell & Co, London. The structure was shipped, in kit form, to the islands aboard the Pacific Steam Navigation Company's vessel SS Ballena. The bridge was erected by engineer Charles P. Peters assisted by a stone mason/foreman and a gang of around 14 navvies. Construction of the steel structure began in October 1924 and was complete by July 1925. The approach roads were complete by October 1925, allowing the bridge to open in time for the start of the sheep shearing season. The structure was inspected by a party of the Royal Engineers during the 1982 Falklands War.  Structure today  The bridge spans . Its principal parts are an roadway (deck) suspended from four primary thick steel cables supported by two high towers at the ends of the span. It is deteriorating and in need of restoration. The Falklands Island Museum and National Trust has raised concerns that the structure may be lost. The bridge can be visited by tourists and lies around a fifteen-minute drive south of Goose Green. The bridge closed to traffic in 1997. A travel guide describes it as magnificent. It is one of the few engineered bridges in the Falklands, where fords and improvised structures are more common. The structure is one of the southernmost suspension bridges. It was chosen for the 37 pence stamp of the October 2000 \\"Bridges of the Falkland Islands\\" local set.

Biography He was born Avraham Sonne, on September 13, 1883 in Przemy≈õl, Austrian Galicia, a region of Eastern Europe which has changed hands throughout history between Austria and Poland. In his youth, Przemy≈õl was part of the Austrian Empire, and he moved to Vienna to study. In 1938 he fled to the British Mandate of Palestine after the German occupation of Vienna. He died in 1950 in Israel of tuberculosis. He had only published eleven poems in his lifetime. These, and a few more, were rediscovered after his death. He was a friend of Elias Canetti, who met him in 1933. Canetti describes \\"Dr. Sonne\\" in his autobiographical book Das Augenspiel (The Play of the Eyes). In his description, Avraham Ben- Yitzhak appears as a profound scholar with interests in religion, philosophy, psychology and sociology. Dr. Sonne had a lasting influence on Canetti, who later wrote a profile of him in the April 7, 1986 edition of The New Yorker.

After high school, he spent a year at Providence College before joining the U.S. Army. After three years in the Army, he finished his college studies at the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma, where he received a B.A. in English in 1959 and fell just short of the requirements for an M.A. in 1962. Berrigan was married to Sandy Berrigan, also a poet, and they had two children: David Berrigan and Kate Berrigan. He and his second wife, the poet Alice Notley, were active in the poetry scene in Chicago for several years, then moved to New York City, where he edited various magazines and books. The New York School A prominent figure in the second generation of the New York School of Poets, Berrigan was peer to Jim Carroll, Anselm Hollo, Alice Notley, Ron Padgett, Anne Waldman, Bernadette Mayer, and Lewis Warsh. He collaborated with Padgett and Joe Brainard on Bean Spasms, a work significant in its rejection of traditional concepts of ownership. Though Berrigan, Padgett, and Brainard all wrote individual poems for the book, and collaborated on many others, no authors were listed for individual poems. In 2005, Ted Berrigan's published and unpublished poetry was published together in a single volume edited by the poet Alice Notley, Berrigan's second wife, and their two sons, Anselm Berrigan, a poet, and Edmund Berrigan, a poet and songwriter. The Sonnets The poet Frank O'Hara called Berrigan's most significant publication, The Sonnets, \\"a fact of modern poetry.\\" A telling reflection of the era that produced it, The Sonnets beautifully weaves together traditional elements of the Shakespearean sonnet form with the disjunctive structure and cadence of T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land and Berrigan's own literary innovations and personal experiences. In the words of Berrigan's editor and second wife Alice Notley, the product was a composition \\"[that is] musical, sexy, and funny.\\" Berrigan was initially drawn to the sonnet form because of its inherent challenge; in his own words, \\"the form sort of [stultifies] the whole process [of writing].\\" The procedure that he ultimately concocted to write The Sonnets is the essence of the work's novelty and ingenuity. After attempting several sonnets, Berrigan decided to go back through what he had written and take out certain lines, one line from each work until he had six lines. He then went through the poems backwards and took one more line from each until he had accumulated six more lines, twelve lines total. Based on this body of the work, Berrigan knew what the final couplet would be; this process became the basis for The Sonnets. Addressing claims that the method is utterly mechanical, Berrigan explains that some of the seventy-seven sonnets came to him \\"whole,\\" without needing to be pieced together. The poet's preoccupation with style, his concern for form and his own role as the creator, as evinced by The Sonnets, pose a challenge to traditional ideas about poetry and signify a fresh and innovative artistic approach. The book recognizes the eternal possibility for invention in a genre seemingly overwhelmed by the success of its traditional forms. By imitating the forms and practices of earlier artists and recreating them to express personal ideas and experiences, Berrigan demonstrates the potential for poetry in his and subsequent generations. As Charles Bernstein succinctly comments, \\"Part collage, part process writing, part sprung lyric, Ted Berrigan's The Sonnets remains‚Ä¶one of the freshest and most buoyantly inspired works of contemporary poetry. Reinventing verse for its time, The Sonnets are redolent with possibilities for our own.‚Äù Death Berrigan died on July 4, 1983 at the age of 48.

After Sewanee, Hall toured with the Harlem Globetrotters and later returned to Kentucky to complete his undergraduate studies. Hall graduated from Kentucky in 1955. Hall previously coached at the University of Central Missouri (formerly Central Missouri State University) in Warrensburg, Missouri and Regis University before returning to Kentucky in 1965 to serve as an assistant coach under Adolph Rupp. In the 1978 NCAA Tournament, he coached the Wildcats to their fifth NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. He was named National Coach of the Year in 1978 and Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year on four occasions. His record at UK was 297‚Äì100, and 373‚Äì156 over his career. Along with the 1978 title, Hall also guided Kentucky to a runner- up finish to UCLA in the 1975 NCAA tournament, a Final Four appearance in the 1984 NCAA Tournament (losing to eventual champion Georgetown), and an NIT championship in 1976. He won eight Southeastern Conference regular season championships and one Southeastern Conference tournament championship. On September 18, 2012, the University of Kentucky unveiled a statue of Hall outside of the Wildcat Coal Lodge to commemorate his accomplishments at UK and his contributions toward the Wildcat Coal Lodge. The university says the bronze sculpture was produced over a period of eight months, beginning as a clay sculpture, then was cast in bronze. It was created by sculptor J.

Edmontosaurus annectens life reconstruction (1909) by Charles R. Knight, based on this mummy. This is not an accurate reconstruction by current knowledge. Charles Hazelius Sternberg (June 15, 1850 ‚Äì July 20, 1943) was an American fossil collector and paleontologist. He was active in both fields from 1876 to 1928, and collected fossils for Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel C. Marsh, and for the British Museum, the San Diego Natural History Museum and other museums. The Sternberg family is legendary in the history of paleontology. Charles Hazelius was the patriarch, and his three sons, George F. Sternberg, Charles Mortram Sternberg and Levi Sternberg were also professional fossil collectors. In 1908, the Sternbergs found a remarkable duckbill dinosaur mummy in the Lance Formation of eastern Wyoming, the first such fossil found. After spirited bidding, the fossil was sold to the American Museum of Natural History. Donald Prothero, The Story of the Dinosaurs in 25 Discoveries. 2019, Columbia University Press, Biography Charles Hazelius Sternberg was born near Cooperstown, New York to Reverend Levi Sternberg and Margaret Levering Miller. At the age of 17, Sternberg moved to Ellsworth County, Kansas where his older brother, Dr. George M. Sternberg (1838‚Äì1915), worked as a military surgeon at Fort Harker and owned a ranch. Once there, Sternberg became interested in collecting fossil leaves from the Dakota Sandstone Formation. From 1875-1876, Sternberg studied at Kansas State University under noted paleontologist Benjamin Franklin Mudge, though Sternberg never earned a degree. In 1876, Edward Drinker Cope funded Sternberg's first formal expedition to Park, Kansas, and Sternberg continued to work with Cope for several field seasons in the years that followed.Sternberg later collected fossils for Cope's rival in the Bone Wars, Othniel C. Marsh, working alongside John Bell Hatcher in Long Island, Kansas. Sternberg also collected for various museums and institutions, and his work took him all over North America, including locations in California, Montana, Texas, and Canada. Sternberg moved to San Diego, California in 1921 and held the honorary title of Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology at the San Diego Natural History Museum. He continued to lead fossil-hunting expeditions throughout North America and sold his specimens to museums and universities world-wide. Sternberg's final expedition was to the Baja Peninsula in 1928. After his wife's death in 1938, Sternberg moved in with his son Levi Sternberg in Toronto, Canada, where he lived until his death aged 93. Sternberg wrote two books about his paleontological adventures: \\"The Life of a Fossil Hunter\\" (1909) and \\"Hunting Dinosaurs in the Badlands of the Red Deer River, Alberta, Canada: A Sequel to The Life of a Fossil Hunter\\" (1917). Personal life Sternberg married Anna Musgrave Reynolds on July 7, 1880. One son died in toddlerhood, and their only daughter died at age 20 in 1911. Three sons survived into adulthood, George F. Sternberg (1883‚Äì1969), Charles Mortram Sternberg (1885‚Äì1981), and Levi Sternberg (1894‚Äì1976), who also had careers in vertebrate paleontology. They became famous for their collecting abilities and many discoveries, including the \\"Trachodon mummy\\", an exquisitely preserved specimen of Edmontosaurus annectens (see hadrosaurid). Son George was also a noted fossil hunter famous for finding a \\"fish within a fish\\" ‚Äî a Xiphactinus which had inside it a nicely preserved, Gillicus arcuatus. Charles Sternberg was a deeply religious man. He wrote devotional poetry and published a collection of poems called A Story of the Past: Or, the Romance of Science (1911). In his old age, he would visit the American Museum of Natural History to view his finds, and one visit to the \\"Trachodon mummy\\" inspired the following quote: Sternberg Museum Fossils collected by Charles Sternberg, including dinosaurs from the western United States and Canada, are in museums around the world. Many of the fossils discovered by Charles Sternberg's son, George F. Sternberg, are on display in the Sternberg Museum of Natural History in Hays, Kansas. In popular culture *In Robert J. Sawyer's novel End of an Era (1994), the Canadian protagonists' time machine is named His Majesty's Canadian Timeship Charles Hazelius Sternberg, because of the two scientists journeying back to the Cretaceous era, one is a paleontologist. The narrator comments that \\"our timeship is almost universally known as the Sternberger, because to most people it looks like a fat hamburger.\\" *Tim Bowling's novel The Bone Sharps (2007) centres about the fossil-hunting work of Charles Sternberg in Kansas, in 1876 and 1916. Secondary characters are Sternberg's young assistant, Scott, who served in the trenches of World War I; another bone hunter, Scott's fiancee (1916) and possibly widow (1975), Lily; and Charles Sternberg's deceased daughter, Maud; as well as Edward Drinker Cope and Cope's wife Annie. *In Dragon Teeth (published posthumously in 2017), Michael Crichton's novel about the Bone Wars, Cope is a protagonist and Sternberg a supporting character.

Its southern terminus is at Interstate 75 near Palmetto, where I-275 heads west towards the Sunshine Skyway Bridge crossing over Tampa Bay. From that point, I-275 passes through St. Petersburg before crossing Tampa Bay again on the Howard Frankland Bridge, then continues through the city of Tampa, where it connects to an interchange with Interstate 4 in Downtown Tampa. After the interchange, I-275 passes north through the Tampa suburbs to its northern terminus at Interstate 75 in Wesley Chapel. Route descriptionSouthern Terminus to St. Petersburg= Interstate 275 begins at exit 228 of Interstate 75 with two lanes in either direction in rural Palmetto. 275 immediately heads west of its parent interstate and has an interchange US 41 up the road. I-275's next interchange is with US 19, beginning a concurrency that lasts . After this exit, I-275 reaches the Southern toll plaza for the Sunshine Skyway Bridge. There is a corresponding Northern toll plaza for southbound travelers. The Sunshine Skyway Bridge is a bridge that spans Tampa Bay. After reaching the northern end of the bridge, 275 enters St. Petersburg. =St. Petersburg= At the northern end of the bridge, drivers briefly drive on the left side as the freeway's lanes invert for about half a mile (about 1 km) before US 19 exits the freeway, serving as a local road in St. Petersburg. I-275 has multiple exits in the city, each of them serving the residential neighborhoods that the freeway passes through. At this point, the interstate widens to 3 lanes in either direction. 275's next major interchange is with Interstate 175, which provides access to Albert Whitted Airport and Tropicana Field, home of the Tampa Bay Rays. The next major interchange occurs less than a mile down the road with Interstate 375, providing access to the waterfront along Tampa Bay. After this exit, I-275 continues through residential neighborhoods until it passes beside Sawgrass Lake Park and then through an area of marshland. The freeway widens to four lanes in either direction before reaching its last interchange in St. Petersburg with SR 687. After traveling in St. Petersburg, I-275 crosses the Howard Frankland Bridge over Old Tampa Bay into Tampa. =Tampa= I-275 has an interchange with SR 589, allowing access to Tampa International Airport. At this point, I-275 thins down to three lanes in either direction, and remains this way for the rest of the freeway. 275 then has an interchange with US 92, the first of two interchanges with the road, allowing access to downtown Tampa. 275 then crosses the Hillsborough River for the first time along its route. Afterwards, from its entry into Tampa, I-275 has its next major interchange with Interstate 4, a junction known locally as Malfunction Junction. This junction was always clogged with daily rush hour traffic and was subsequently overhauled. This interchange serves as I-4's western terminus, and allows access to Orlando and the east coast of Florida. After this major exit, 275 reaches an interchange with US 92 again, also allowing access to US 41. After this interchange, US 41 acts as the local road for the freeway for the rest of its route. 275 crosses the Hillsborough River a second time and enters residential neighborhoods within Tampa. 275 travels due north and parallel to US 41 for before turning northeast towards Interstate 75. At this point, 275 exits Tampa and enters Lutz, a suburb of Tampa. I-275 then reconnects with its parent interstate highway (I-75) and reaches its northern terminus. =Lane configurations= * Between southern terminus and Exit 17, including the Sunshine Skyway Bridge: two lanes each way excluding the toll plaza * Between Exit 17 and Exit 30: three lanes each way ** Between Exits 22 and 23A: two lanes each way ** Between Exits 25 and 26: four lanes each way, with the right lane in both directions designated \\"exit only\\" * Between Exits 30 and 39, including the Howard Frankland Bridge: four lanes each way * Between Exit 39 and northern terminus: mostly three lanes each way ** Through Exit 39 two lanes in each way ** Southbound I-275 two lanes for most I-275 I-4 interchange HistoryInitial construction in Tampa= Model of the Downtown Distributor (ca.1960), from Malfunction Junction (right) to Hillsborough River (upper left). I-275 originally opened in 1962 as a segment of I-75, from the present northern terminus to a diamond interchange at Bearss Avenue. The portion of Interstate 4 that would later become a part of I-275, the Howard Frankland Bridge, and its short freeway stubs at the bridge's endpoints, opened to traffic about a year earlier. In 1964, the stub of what was then known as I-4 between 50th St. (through \\"Malfunction Junction\\") and Armenia Avenue was completed. \\"Malfunction Junction's\\" northern end was a pair of ramp stubs that would later be filled in by I-75. In 1965, the segment of I-75 from \\"Malfunction Junction\\" to about Sligh Avenue was completed, and by 1967, the remaining gaps in I-4 and I-75 were filled and opened to traffic. =Controversy and repeated delays in Pinellas= Around 1970, plans for the extension of I-75 into Pinellas County began. However, the first round of local opposition would lead to the eventual (and repeated) delays of I-75 through St. Petersburg. The first setback was led by 4th Street business owners and residents who demanded that construction on I-75 be stopped, since the bridge was already funneling unwanted traffic into the corridor. It has since seen many unforeseen business and residential booms, due to the building of this bridge. At the same time, construction began on I-75 from Roosevelt Boulevard to about 38th Avenue North. By this time, I-4 was truncated to \\"Malfunction Junction,\\" allowing the I-75 designation take over the freeway from the junction to 4th Street North. This segment was opened to traffic in 1973, with the gap between Roosevelt and 9th Street filled in a few years later. Around this time, I-75 was resigned I-275, and after some more local opposition, I-275 was constructed to meander down to 5th Avenue N, near downtown St. Petersburg, in 1975. The original plans called for I-75 to end in Tampa The construction of I-275 over nearly a 50 year period between 1970 and 2016 uprooted many Black families in the Methodist Town, Gas Plant and Twenty-Second Street neighborhoods. These practices of eminent domain by the St. Petersburg government helped to shut down small companies in these neighborhoods, and sustained White businesses that were located more centrally. Families in the Gas Plant neighborhood were assured good jobs at Tropicana Field to help ease the burden of moving. During the 1970s, the government removed 285 buildings and 500 families to help build the interstate which cost $11.3 million. The widespread demolition included 10 African American churches.Belcastro, Philip, \\"Poverty, Planning, Policy and Race: Urban Design in St. Petersburg, Florida, since 1965\\" (2017). USFSP Honors Program Theses (Undergraduate). 219 The families in the bulldozed Gas Plant neighborhood were guaranteed cheaper homes and 600 new jobs by the city, but these offers were never delivered. Many members in the affected neighborhoods found the actions taken by the government to be very controversial. In 1977, Mr. Chester James was appointed by the city government as the representative from Methodist Town to vote on the future development plans of his neighborhood. However, the city's unclear plans led him to vote in favor of evicting 377 families (including his own) from the neighborhood. There is also contention about the location of I-275 in Southwest St. Petersburg, as its current placement is very similar to that of the 1935 segregation initiative perimeter. Financial burdens through this part of the project caused further delays. However, I-375 opened partially to traffic in 1979, with full operation by 1981, and I-175 opened up in 1980. With both downtown feeders now open, I-275 was extended to 28th Street South. However, another round of community revolts delayed the segment of I-275 between 28th Street South and 22nd Avenue South. In spite of the delay, the stretch was built by 1981. Exit 20 was configured for an anticipated westward expansion to a planned Pinellas Beltway. A freeway revolt killed many of Pinellas County's freeways during the 1970s, and repeatedly delayed the construction of I-275. In addition, the Summit Venture disaster on May 9, 1980, during which the freighter Summit Venture took down one of the two spans of the Sunshine Skyway and killed 35 people, reduced a portion of I-275 to two lanes until the opening of the present bridge in April 1987. In 1982, the segment between 22nd Avenue South and 39th Avenue South was opened to traffic. The Pinellas Bayway/US 19 interchange, opened to traffic in 1983-84, is inverted for about half a mile. The reason for this configuration is unknown; however, to this day, traffic continues to flow smoothly through the interchange with very little congestion. At about the same time this interchange opened, I-275 was completed from the Sunshine Skyway Bridge to the southern terminus with I-75 in Manatee County. When the new Sunshine Skyway Bridge opened in 1987, the final link of I-275, between US 19 and the bridge, was completed and opened to traffic. =Reconstruction and later changes= The segment of I-275 between the Veterans Expressway and Himes Avenue was widened from four to six lanes in 1974. Additionally, a median barrier was built along the highway from Himes Ave to Downtown Tampa. I-275 entering Downtown Tampa Until the 1980s, the Memorial Hwy./Veterans Exwy. interchange was only a half diamond, and the West Shore Blvd interchange was a full diamond. Both interchanges underwent drastic changes to allow safe, free-flowing movement to and from Tampa International Airport and the Veterans Expressway. Among the improvements, three free- flowing exit and entry ramps were added to the expressway from I-275. The exit ramp from I-275 south to the Veterans Expressway northbound was reconstructed, and the ramp from Memorial Highway northbound from Kennedy Blvd. onto northbound I-275 was removed, along with the two western ramps onto West Shore Blvd. (truncating the West Shore interchange to a half-diamond), in order to deter accidents that were being caused by commuters entering and exiting the interstate from the Veterans Exwy. In addition, connections from I-275 north, to Cypress St. were made (though the ramps are under-utilized today). In 2004, the ramp from southbound Veterans Exwy to southbound I-275 was realigned in order to ease congestion on the mainline lanes of the interstate. I-275 just leaving Downtown Tampa heading south towards Tampa International Airport In 1984, the Himes Ave. exit/entrance was constructed. The exit was originally rumored to supplement a failed redevelopment project in the area during that time. Today, the Himes Ave. connection serves as reliever for nearby Raymond James Stadium. In 1991, following the expansion of the Howard Frankland Bridge, the 4th St. N interchange was reconstructed. In 1994, the two drawbridges on the northern approach to the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, dating to the original twin Skyway bridges, were replaced with high-level fixed spans, eliminating bottlenecks caused by openings. Between 1994 and 1998, there were no major projects taking place on the highway, and I-275 saw very few changes. The hiatus ended in 1999, when a much needed, dual-stage, widening project took place between Busch Blvd. (State Road 580) and Bearss Ave. The project widened I-275 mainline from four to six lanes, rehabilitated the existing concrete surfaces, and improved interchange flow, lighting, signage, and drainage. The project was completed in 2003. The northern toll plaza to the Sunshine Skyway Bridge was relocated south of the approach bridge in 2000 due to a lack of capacity. The original plaza only allowed three lanes, while the replacement allows six lanes to flow through, with the sixth lane dedicated to SunPass users. In 2001, the widening project for I-275 between Gandy Blvd and Roosevelt Blvd began. The project increased I-275 from six to eight lanes, and its existing concrete surfaces were rehabilitated. A reconfiguration of the Roosevelt Interchange (Exit 30) started in 2001 and added access to 118th Ave. N at the same interchange. The new connection to 118th Ave. N is the first phase of a proposed freeway to connect I-275 to the Bayside Bridge (although it is unclear if future segments will be built). All construction in this area was completed by 2002. Reconstruction of I-275 between Roosevelt Blvd. and 4th St. N quickly followed the widening project. Lane counts on I-275 were increased from four to mostly six lanes (with some eight-lane segments). The Ulmerton Rd. and 9th St. N interchanges were originally narrow 1959 configurations that caused much congestion in the area. Additionally, the 9th/MLK St. N exit and Ulmerton Rd. entrance ramps were situated in the left lane of I-275, causing dangerous weaving patterns. These interchanges were reconstructed into right-lane configurations, and two new ramps were added from Ulmerton Rd. (one leading to 9th St. N and one exiting onto southbound I-275). The southbound I-275 exits to Ulmerton and MLK St. N were combined into one exit ramp to provide better flow. The MLK St. N interchange was shut down for several months as a result of the reconstruction. Finally, the ramps to and from 118th Ave. N were opened to traffic. The entire reconstruction project along I-275 in the Gateway area was completed in 2005. In 2003 operational improvements began for the notorious \\"Malfunction Junction\\" in downtown Tampa. The project consisted of widening mainline I-275 and I-4, along with an array of ramp and bridge improvements, lighting and drainage work, and new signs. The entire project was completed on December 22, 2006, with ITS components installed by March 2007. The renovation of the I-4 corridor through Ybor City was finished around summer 2007, almost one year ahead of schedule. I-275 at \\"Malfunction Junction\\" The staged reconstruction project for I-275 between the Howard Frankland Bridge and downtown Tampa was supposed to begin in the summer of 2006. However, bids received by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) for the project came in at $100 million (40%) over the projected estimates, which was blamed on the rising cost of asphalt and other materials, which was, in turn, partly blamed on the rising oil prices worldwide. As a result, FDOT commenced with the project in four smaller phases, rather than the original, large-scale, two-phase project. Construction began on phase one, the northbound lanes (south of the existing interstate) between Himes Ave and downtown Tampa, on August 13, 2007, and was completed in April 2010.Northbound I-275 from Himes Avenue to the Hillsborough River (new alignment, completed April 2010) Phase two, which includes construction of the northbound lanes from the West Shore area to Himes, was originally scheduled to begin in 2008, but was delayed further. The third phase will consist of transferring northbound traffic onto the new northbound lanes, southbound traffic onto the existing northbound lanes, and the construction of the new southbound lanes from Himes to downtown. Finally, the fourth and final phase will construct the new southbound lanes from the West Shore area to Himes. The entire project was originally scheduled to be completed by around 2013 or 2014, but it was extended until spring 2015\\"I-275 Widening from east of SR 60 to downtown Tampa (Hillsborough River)\\". MyTBI / Florida Department of Transportation. and costed an estimated $540 million, an increase from the original $350 million budget.I-275 plan hits $100M bump. St. Petersburg Times: June 28, 2006 Finally, on March 30, 2015 the fourth and final phase was finished with the new lanes finally opening, ending the long term project in downtown Tampa. Between Himes Avenue and downtown, southbound (westbound) traffic was shifted on to the original northbound lanes. However, those wishing to exit at either the Howard/Armenia or Himes Avenue exits continue on the original southbound lanes. Those exiting on Himes Avenue have one dedicated lane in the original southbound lanes. Traffic entering the freeway from Armenia Ave. now does so on the original northbound exit ramp. This creates an odd left-lane merge situation. However, to help motorists in this effort, the entrance ramp has a dedicated lane from the freeway entrance until just over the Himes Avenue bridge. Traffic heading northbound on Howard Avenue must now turn left onto Green Ave., left onto Armenia Avenue, and then right onto the entrance ramp in order to enter the freeway. While this setup is temporary, it has somewhat improved traffic flow in the area, as motorists who intend to exit at Howard/Armenia or Himes now exit the freeway much earlier. In January 2011, construction began on widening the northernmost segment of I-275 from US 41 (Nebraska Ave.) to the I-75 apex from four to six lanes. The project also includes constructing a dedicated flyover ramp over I-75 towards State Road 56.I-275 Widening / ITS from U.S. 41 to I-75 This ramp, along with a new, extended ramp from I-75 to SR 56, opened on August 18, 2011. On February 4, 2011, a new ramp connecting northbound I-275 to 118th Ave. N opened. This project began in July 2009 and involved widening the existing ramp from northbound I-275 to Roosevelt Blvd., and is being performed in conjunction with the project to build the Mid Pinellas Expressway, which has suffered numerous delays due to a lack of funding.Northbound I-275 Connector to CR 296/SR 686 =Other improvements= Other sections not requiring a full-scale reconstruction have undergone improvements. * Concrete rehabilitation from 62nd Ave. N to Exit 17 in Pinellas County, complete, 2001-2005 * Resurfacing from the Howard Frankland Bridge to Himes Ave. (Exit 41C), complete, 2002 * Resurfacing from the US 41 overpass (Exit 53) to I-75 junction in Lutz, complete, 2003 * Resurfacing from the Howard Frankland Bridge to 4th St. N, complete, 2006 * Concrete rehabilitation/bridge upgrade/lighting improvements from \\"Malfunction Junction\\" to Busch Blvd, complete, 2007 * Concrete rehabilitation from 26th Ave. N to Exit 23, complete, 2008) * Rehabilitation at Exit 28, complete, 2008 * Resurfacing between Exit 17 to the Misner Bridge in Pinellas County (currently ongoing)I-275 Resurfacing from Misener Bridge to 54th Avenue South * Widening of the northbound exit ramp at Exit 51 in Hillsborough County (currently ongoing)Northbound I-275 Exit Ramp Widening at Fowler Avenue The segment of I-275 in Manatee County has not changed dramatically since its construction in 1983, other than a toll plaza upgrade in the late 1990s, and resurfacing of the mainline lanes between the I-75 apex and the US 19 exit. It is unclear if any other improvements are planned at this time. =Naming of the highway= In November 2005, The Florida Legislature dedicated the section of I-275 in Pinellas County as the \\"St. Petersburg Parkway/William C. Cramer Memorial Highway\\". William Cato Cramer was a native of St. Petersburg who served as a member of the Florida Legislature from 1955 through 1971. He helped to procure the building of I-275 through Pinellas County.The Political Graveyard: Index to Politicians: Cramer In popular culture In 1988 (one year after the present Sunshine Skyway Bridge opened to traffic), the views of both the Old Sunshine Skyway and the New Sunshine Skyway were seen in the Season 1 intro of the Superboy Television series (which is based on DC Comics character Superman {in his preteen and teenage years as Superboy}). This started and finished before the demolition of Old Sunshine Skyway in 1993 as the Superboy TV series ended its run about one year before the bridge demolition in 1992. Services Interstate 275 has two rest areas, one at each end of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge. Both rest areas, each accessible by traffic in both directions, have rest rooms, vending machines, picnic tables, dog walk areas and nighttime security. These rest areas also provide access to the fishing piers, for an extra fee.

Route description  I-71/I-75 to Indiana = Aerial view of I-275 near the CVG Airport I-275 heads west toward Indiana passing by the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, with Kentucky Route 212 (KY 212) used as the service road to and from the airport. Then near Hebron, west of the airport, I-275 has an interchange with Kentucky Route 237 (KY 237), before passing over the Ohio River into Indiana. = Indiana = In Indiana I-275 passes through a rural area with only one interchange at US 50/State Road 1 (SR 1). I-275 heads northeast towards Ohio; at the Ohio state line I-275 passes over US 50\\\\. = Ohio = Along I-275 on its northeast side I-275 heads northeast towards Springdale, and I-275 runs concurrently with I-74 and US 52. When the concurrency ends, I-275 has an intersection with Ohio State Route 126 (SR 126, Ronald Reagan Cross County Highway). Then I-275 has interchanges with US 27 and US 127\\\\. I-275 turns east having an interchange with SR 4, SR 747, I-75, and US 42\\\\. I-275 turns southeast having an interchange with I-71 and US 22/SR 3\\\\. I-275 passes over the Little Miami River, entering Clermont County, where it is officially named in honor of Matt Maupin, a local soldier killed during the Iraq War. I-275 turns due south toward Milford and connects with SR 28, SR 450, SR 32, and SR 125\\\\. I-275 turns due west towards Kentucky, passing through a short concurrency with US 52, before crossing over the Ohio River into Kentucky. = Ohio to I-71/I-75 = From Ohio I-275 heads southwest towards Highland Heights. I-275 has an interchange with I-471 near Highland Heights. I-275 turns due west towards Crestview Hills, passing through an interchange with KY 9, KY 16, and KY 17\\\\. In Crestview Hills I-275 has an interchange with US 25/US 42/US 127\\\\. I-275 turns northeast towards I-71/I-75.  History  I-74/I-275 bridge accident = On May 20, 2008, a tractor-trailer hauling a locomotive separated while traveling on the ramp from westbound I-74 to southbound I-275. After the trailer detached, it crashed into supports for the bridge on I-74 eastbound going over the ramps between I-275 and I-74 westbound. As a result, the Ohio Department of Transportation shut down eastbound I-74 for several weeks. Both ramps between I-74 west and I-275 were closed as well, because of fears the bridge would collapse, but two crossovers were built so that traffic could use one lane of westbound I-74 to travel east around the damaged bridge.

The third all-aluminum engine of Hyundai Motor Company debuted in the fourth- generation Hyundai Sonata sedan (codenamed NF), which was unveiled in August 2004 in South Korea. Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama (HMMA) built a Theta II engine shop on the grounds of their Montgomery, Alabama automobile factory. Global Engine Alliance The Global Engine Alliance was a joint venture between Chrysler, Mitsubishi Motors, and the Hyundai Motor Company for developing a line of shared 4-cylinder engines. The initial design of the engine block and cylinder head was handled by Hyundai. However, each manufacturer configured their variants of the initial design differently based on their needs. In 2009, Chrysler bought out Mitsubishi and Hyundai's stake in the joint-venture; however, each company retained rights to build the engines. Technical detailsTheta= The engine features hollow stainless-steel dual overhead camshafts (DOHC) with powder-metal cam lobes, pent-roof combustion chambers and shimless bucket tappets in the cylinder head. BorgWarner Morse TEC supplies the complete timing system which uses the company's proprietary silent timing chains. Continuously variable valve timing (CVVT) works on the intake side. The aluminum alloy engine block, which is formed using a high-pressure die-cast method, has a unique Metaldyne-supplied cassette-type balance shaft module with a two-stage oil pump built-in. In the lower-end, the block is reinforced by a ladder frame. Other notable features include fracture-split sinter-forged connecting rods manufactured by Sinteron and a stainless-steel exhaust manifold. Theta's EMS (engine management system) software is EMS-II from Siemens VDO and the 32-bit PCM (Powertrain Control Module) calculates the amount of intake air by utilizing a contamination-proof hot-film type MAF (mass air flow) sensor. The first version of the Theta Engine had three variants, 1.8L, 2.0L and 2.4L. 1.8L (G4KB) The 1.8L version is an inline 4-cylinder engine that carries a 10.5:1 compression ratio; the engine makes at 6,200 rpm and of torque at 4,250 rpm. 2.0L (G4KA) The 2.0L version is an inline 4-cylinder engine that carries a bore and stroke of 86 mm and a 10.5:1 compression ratio; the engine makes at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm. It uses a timing chain instead of belt, and the engine dry weight is . 2.4L (G4KC) The 2.4L version is an inline 4-cylinder engine that carries a bore of 88.0 mm, stroke of 97.0 mm and a 10.5:1 compression ratio; the engine makes at 5,800 rpm and of torque at 4,250 rpm. =Theta II MPi = The second generation Theta engine added CVVT on the exhaust side as well as a two-way VIS and comes in two sizes, the 2.0L (G4KD) and 2.4L (G4KE). 2.0L (G4KD) The 2.0L Theta II MPi engine has a 10.5:1 compression ratio, and it produces at 6,200 rpm and of torque at 4,600 rpm. 2.4L (G4KE/G4KG) The 2.4L Theta II MPi engine has a 10.3:1 compression ratio, and it produces at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm. =Theta II GDi = The Theta II GDi was announced in November 2009 starting with the 6th generation Sonata, improvements include switching to GDI. 2.4L (G4KJ) The 2.4L Theta II GDi engine has a 11.3:1 compression ratio, early versions were rated at at 6,300 rpm and of torque at 4,250 rpm while later versions were rated at at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm. =Theta II Turbo MPi= The Theta II Turbo MPi was used in the Genesis Coupe. The turbo used is a Mitsubishi TD04 model. The Theta block used is very similar to the Mitsubishi Evolution X 4B11T, as core components like pistons and rods are said to move freely between them, however, the two engines are not identical. The 4B11T is a semi-closed deck block with larger oil and coolant passages, where as the Theta is an open deck block. 2.0L (G4KF) The 2.0L MPI turbo in the 2009‚Äì2012 Genesis Coupe, it produced at 6,000 rpm and on 91 RON/87 octane (AKI) gasoline, and at 6,000 rpm on 98 RON/93 octane (AKI). Torque remains the same at at 2,000 rpm. For the facelifted 2013‚Äì2014 Genesis Coupe, the engines got upgraded with a new twin-scroll turbocharger with new version now producing at 6,000 rpm and of torque between 2,000 and 4,500 rpm on 91 RON/87 octane (AKI) gasoline, and at 6,000 rpm and of torque between 2,000 and 4,500 rpm on 98 RON/93 octane. =Theta II Turbo GDi=2.0L (G4KH) The 2.0L GDI turbo in 6th generation Sonata and 3rd generation Optima develops at 6,000 rpm and of torque between 1,750 rpm and 4,500 rpm. For the 7th generation Sonata and 4th generation Optima, the engine develops at 6,000 rpm and of torque between 1,350 rpm and 4,000 rpm. For the i30N and Veloster N, the engine develops at 6,000 rpm and of torque between 1,450 rpm and 4,700 rpm. 2.0L (G4KL) For the Genesis G70 and the Kia Stinger, the engine develops at 6,200 rpm and of torque between 1,400 rpm and 4,000 rpm. =Theta II HEV=2.4L (G4KK)ApplicationsTheta/Theta-II (2.0L)= 2.0L DOHC engine in a Kia (G4KD) (G4KA, G4KD) * Hyundai ix35 (2009‚Äì2015) * Hyundai Sonata (2009‚Äì2014) * Kia Forte (2009‚Äì2012) * Kia Rondo (2006‚Äì2013) =Theta/Theta-II (2.4L)= (G4KC, G4KE, G4KG, G4KJ) * Hyundai Santa Fe (2010‚Äìpresent) * Hyundai Sonata (Theta First Gen 2006‚Äì2010) Theta II (2009‚Äì2019) * Hyundai Starex (2007‚Äìpresent) * Hyundai Tucson (2010‚Äìpresent) * Kia Cadenza (2010‚Äì2019) * Kia Forte (2010‚Äì2013) * Kia Optima (Theta First Gen 2006‚Äì2010) Theta II (2011‚Äì2019) * Kia Rondo (2007‚Äì2013) * Kia Sportage (2011‚Äìpresent) * Kia Sorento (2011‚Äì2020) =Theta-II 2.0 Turbo (2.0T)= 2011 Hyundai Sonata Limited 2.0T, turbo GDI engine (G4KF, G4KH, G4KL) * Genesis G70 (2017‚Äìpresent) * Hyundai Genesis Coupe (2009‚Äì2014) * Hyundai i30N (2018‚Äìpresent) * Hyundai Santa Fe (2012‚Äìpresent) * Hyundai Sonata (2009‚Äì2019) * Hyundai Veloster N (2018‚Äìpresent) * Kia Optima (2011‚Äì2019) * Kia Sorento (2015‚Äì2020) * Kia Sportage (2011‚Äìpresent) * Kia Stinger (2017‚Äìpresent) Engine recall Hyundai and Kia vehicles equipped with Theta II engines were recalled, due to the fact that those engines were, and continue to be, the subject of an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Safety regulators are investigating if Hyundai and Kia did enough in a timely manner with regards to the recalls of nearly 1.7 million vehicles with Theta engines, which were prone to an abnormal amount of noise and seizing. In September 2015, Hyundai recalled about 470,000 model year 2011-2012 Sonatas equipped with 2-liter and 2.4-liter Theta II engines. At the time, Hyundai told NHTSA that manufacturing problems left metallic debris around the engine crankshaft, causing problems with oil flow. The pieces of metal interfere with the oil flow through the connecting rod bearings and damage the connecting rods. The automaker blamed the problem on a mechanical \\"deburring\\" process used to remove metallic machining debris from the crankshaft. By April 2017, Hyundai expanded the 2015 recall by including another 572,000 vehicles with Theta II engines, including 2013-2014 Hyundai Sonata and Santa Fe Sport vehicles. Hyundai told safety regulators the same metal debris problem caused the expanded recall. Near that same time, Kia told NHTSA about a recall of more than 618,000 model year 2011-2014 Kia Optima, 2012-2014 Sorento and 2011-2013 Sportage vehicles because the Theta engine bearings wore out too early and caused the engines to seize. Kia said it didn't recall the vehicles in 2015 when Hyundai first recalled its cars because the Theta II engines in the Kia vehicles were built on a different production line and had different problems than Hyundai. In addition to customers complaining about the Theta II engines, a Korean whistleblower who worked for Hyundai as an engineer let NHTSA know what he knew. Owners started suing after the automaker refused to pay the thousands of dollars to repair or replace the engines, with one lawsuit from 2015 alleging a dealer wanted $4,500 to do the work. Kia was also served papers over a class-action lawsuit in 2016 filed by owners of vehicles equipped with Theta engines. NHTSA says it took action to \\"investigate both the timeliness and scope of Hyundai's Theta II engine recalls, and Hyundai's compliance with reporting requirements.\\" In Canada in 2019 Hyundai announced a recall for most vehicles using the affected engines, however a class action lawsuit was filed in 2018 as a result of failures of this engine used in Canadian Forte models and lack of manufacturer support against Hyundai Canada. Based on information from Hyundai Motor company (korea), this recall is not applicable in the ASIA PACIFIC market. Crate engines On 2013-11-05, Hyundai announced the creation of a new factory crate engine program at the 2013 SEMA Show in Las Vegas, which initially included a 2.0-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder engine.

The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) maintains the highway as part of the larger state trunkline highway system. The freeway runs through the western suburbs near Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, and crosses several rivers and rail lines in the area. The southern terminus is the interchange with I-75 near Newport, northeast of Monroe. MDOT considers the Interstate to run to an interchange with I-96, I-696 and M-5 on the Farmington Hills‚ÄìNovi city line, running concurrently with I-96 for about . This gives a total length of about , which is backed up by official signage. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the length is because that agency considers I-275 to end at the junction with I-96 and M-14 along the boundary between Livonia and Plymouth Township. All other map makers, like the American Automobile Association, Rand McNally and Google Maps follow MDOT's practice. A highway roughly parallel to the modern I-275 was included in early planning maps for the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s. As plans developed through the 1960s and into the early 1970s, the freeway was to run from I-75 near Newport north to Novi and connect back to I-75 near Davisburg. Some plans in the 1970s had the northern Novi‚ÄìDavisburg section numbered as a state highway M-275. The southern half of I-275 was built in segments that were completed in January 1977. Later that month, the state canceled the northern section because of local opposition. A later attempt to revive the proposal failed in 1979. Additional plans to complete M-275 through Oakland County were kept on the drawing boards through the 1980s, but failed to materialize. M-5 (Haggerty Connector) opened along part of the former I-275/M-275 right-of-way between 1994 and 2000. Route description I-275 begins at exit 20 along I-75 in northeastern Monroe County. The surrounding area is farmland and residential subdivisions in the adjacent Frenchtown and Berlin charter townships near the community of Newport. The freeway angles to the northwest and crosses US Highway 24 (US 24), which is also called Telegraph Road. After this interchange, I-275 turns to the north, running east of Carleton, crossing the Canadian National Railway and Conrail Shared Assets lines north of exit 5\\\\. At Will Carleton Road, the trunkline crosses into Wayne County. There it continues on a northerly path parallel to a CSX Transportation line through southern Wayne County. The freeway crosses the Huron River at South Huron Road, adjacent to Willow Metropark. alt=Photograph of the road signage at the split In the city of Romulus, I-275 begins to take on a more suburban character when it passes the southwestern boundary of the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. There is access to the south side of the airport signed at Eureka Road and to the north side at I-94. Between these two interchanges, I-275 begins to run to the northwest. South of I-94, the highway crosses over the same CSX line and a Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) line and north of I-94, it passes a campus of Wayne County Community College and the headquarters of the Visteon Corporation, a major auto parts supplier spun off from Ford Motor Company. Near these two complexes, the freeway turns north again, running parallel and to the east of Haggerty Road. The freeway crosses over another NS railroad line also used by Amtrak trains from Chicago and Pontiac, US 12 (Michigan Avenue) and M-153 (Ford Road) in Canton. I-275 crosses the Lower Branch of the River Rouge north of Michigan Avenue and the Middle Branch north of Ford Road, and it also crosses over a CSX line again. North of the Middle Branch of the River Rouge in Plymouth Township, I-275 crosses Schoolcraft Road and another CSX line from Detroit. The interchange with I-96 (Jeffries Freeway) on the border between Plymouth Township and Livonia is where the FHWA considers I-275 to end as they do not note any overlap with I-96, however MDOT continues the designation on maps and signage to run concurrently with I-96 northward. I-96 merges from the east on the Jeffries Freeway and turns north; from the west, the M-14 freeway merges and ends. At the time the freeway from this interchange northward to Farmington Hills was opened to traffic, it was dual signed as I-96/I-275, and the unbuilt segment of freeway from Novi to Davisburg that was to be either I-275 or M-275 was still an active proposal. I-275 is shown running concurrently with I-96 through Livonia and Farmington Hills on MDOT maps, and other map makers and mapping service providers such as the American Automobile Association, Rand McNally and Google Maps label their maps in accordance with MDOT and not FHWA. alt=Aerial photograph North of the interchange with the Jeffries Freeway, the combined I-96/I-275 curves to the east into Livonia, running parallel to Haggerty Road and continuing through suburban areas. The freeway has interchanges with 6 Mile and 7 Mile roads in the northwest corner of Livonia. I-96/I-275 passes through an interchange with 8 Mile Road while crossing into Oakland County entering the southwest corner of Farmington Hills. North of 10 Mile Road, I-96/I-275 crosses Grand River Avenue. Here the ramps start to connect with both directions of M-5, the start of eastbound I-696 or the continuation of westbound I-96. MDOT ends the I-275 designation at this massive interchange. HistoryOriginal plans= alt=Black & white map A north‚Äìsouth freeway was originally planned as an Interstate Highway allowing through traffic to bypass the city of Detroit. This plan was included in the 1955 General Location of National System of Interstate Highways (Yellow Book), an early proposal for what would become the Interstate Highway System. The Yellow Book contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Detroit area including a north‚Äìsouth freeway east of the current I-275 corridor. The 1958 numbering plan for Michigan submitted by the State Highway Department had this route initially marked as I-73. William Swanson in the MDOT Highway Planning Unit later stated that the department also planned to reverse the numbering of I-75 and I-275 between Newport and Davisburg; I-75 would have bypassed downtown Detroit just as it bypassed downtown Flint and downtown Saginaw to the north, and the auxiliary number (I-275) would have been used on the freeway through downtown Detroit. The present-day freeway was built in stages in the mid-1970s. In 1974, the state highway map of the time showed the highway under construction, but no parts completed. The first of the freeway were shown opened to traffic from M-153 (Ford Road) in Canton to Schoolcraft Avenue (just south of the I-96 and M-14 interchange) in Plymouth Township by the start of 1975. The segment between US 24 and I-75 in Monroe County was open as well. The second phase was completed in the latter half of 1976, when I-275 was extended north from Schoolcraft Avenue (and the incomplete interchange with the future route of I-96) to the I-96/I-696 interchange in Novi. Then on January 14, 1977, the remaining section of I-275 between US 24 in Monroe County and M-153 in Canton Township was opened to traffic, completing the current freeway. The final cost to build the I-275 freeway was $145 million (equivalent to $ in ). =Cancellation of northern segment= The Michigan State Highway Commission canceled the northern section of the highway, originally planned to continue northward from Novi to a point near Davisburg and Clarkston, on January 26, 1977, after it spent $1.6 million (equivalent to $ in ) the year before purchasing land for the roadway. This northern section was not planned as an Interstate Highway at that time, bearing the designation M-275 instead. Opposition to construction came from various citizens' groups and different levels of local government. Additionally, both The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press opposed the project. The Detroit City Council, led by then-Chairman Carl Levin, opposed the plan. Levin said at the time, \\"At last I think people are waking up to the dangers of more and more expressways. At some point we've got to say enough. And I think we've reached it.\\" The US Department of the Interior reviewed the state's environmental impact study of the project and stated that the project, \\"will cause irreparable damages on recreation lands, wetlands, surface waters and wildlife habitat\\". The total project to link Farmington Hills with Davisburg with the extension would have cost $69.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) and saved drivers an estimated eight minutes off travel time around the city of Detroit. =I-96 overlap= The Jeffries Freeway project was in its final stages of construction in 1977, linking the final of I-96 at M-39 (Southfield Freeway) with the I-275 freeway. After it was completed, I-96 was routed to run concurrently with I-275 between Novi and Plymouth Township, and the segments of freeway through Farmington and Farmington Hills that were to be part of I-96 instead became part of an extended M-102. At the end of the 1970s, MDOT took part in a FHWA-backed initiative called the Positive Guidance Demonstration Project, and the two agencies audited signage practices in the vicinity of the I-96/M-37 and I-296/US 131 interchange in Walker near Grand Rapids. MDOT determined that usage of the I-296 designation overlapping US 131 was \\"a potential source of confusion for motorists\\". FHWA agreed with the department's proposal to eliminate all signage and public map references to the designation in April 1979. MDOT then received formal permission from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) on October 13, and from the FHWA on December 3, 1979, to remove the redundant highway designation from signage and most maps. Following this program, the Reflective Systems Unit at MDOT reviewed the state of two- and three-way concurrencies along the highway system in Michigan. They approached the department's Trunkline Numbering Committee and the district traffic and safety engineers on October 19, 1982, for proposals to reduce or eliminate the various overlapping designations to \\"avoid driver confusion and save funds\\". Included on the initial discussion report was the I-96/I-275 concurrency with a request for comments by November 5 of that year. When the unit released its final recommendations on March 17, 1983, no changes were proposed regarding the I-96/I-275 concurrency. Other recommendations, such as removing US 2 and US 10 from overlaps with I-75 were implemented in later in 1983 and in 1985, respectively. =New extension plan= A least one transportation study in the early 1970s identified the highway north of Novi as M-275. The Oakland County Road Commission, local land developers, and local politicians supported building a highway along the route of M-275 to open up the area for development. After the January 1977 cancelation of M-275 as a full freeway, the state explored building the highway as a parkway instead. This parkway concept allowed at-grade intersections that would have not been permitted had the highway been built as a full freeway, and included more landscaping and less grade separation. In September 1977, the State Transportation Commission ordered MDOT to study alternatives to a freeway in the area, along with the possible widening of I-94 and US 23 and the improvement of local roads to handle increased traffic caused by the absence of an extended I-275 from the state's freeway network. The canceled highway project was revisited by the State Transportation Commission in 1979 as M-275. The renewed interest came after a vote of local residents showed a desire for the road. The Michigan Department of State Highways and Transportation backed the proposal with the support of local officials around the highway and the highway lobby. The 22-year-old proposal was deemed \\"necessary\\" by the department to alleviate highway congestion along other area highways. The Department of the Interior continued to oppose the highway on environmental grounds. M-275 would have cut through Dodge No. 4 State Park in Oakland County if completed. Another factor that helped sink the project was the rising costs. Estimates in 1979 placed a $100 million (equivalent to $ in ) price tag on the project. Despite funding increases for MDOT by the State Legislature, M-275 languished on the drawing boards. New plans in 1983 had addressed several of the environmental concerns by moving interchanges and rerouting around wetlands. These plans even canceled an extension of Northwestern Highway (then M-4, now part of M-10) to Pontiac Trail and a connection with M-275. The state increased MDOT's budget by $602 million (equivalent to $ in ), but left the M-275 project off a priority list. The Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) continued to factor M-275 into regional transportation planning forecasts. SEMCOG's position was that the location population that would be served by the new highway would rival 70 of Michigan's counties combined, yet there was no four-lane highways through the area. Opponents cited urban sprawl, which SEMCOG dismissed because the population was already in the area of the new highway. Transportation planners at an April 24, 1985, meeting of the West Bloomfield Republicans said that the highway extension \\"would make sense\\" but MDOT \\"is planning no new freeways and no major road construction\\" at the time. By the next month, MDOT had relinquished ownership of right-of-way in West Bloomfield Township, ending any further progress at building the roadway. Studies comparing the levels of traffic at various checkpoints along the existing I-275 showed that the freeway was only handling half of its rated capacity. At 8 Mile Road, the freeway carried 57,000 vehicles in 1977 and 88,000 vehicles in 1984. This compared to a 1986 projection of 133,000 vehicles daily. After many years of inactivity, further work began along this same route to relieve traffic congestion in the area, but the resulting highway was designated as a part of M-5 rather than I-275 or M-275. The first section of this freeway extension was opened in October 1994. This extended a freeway from I-275's previous terminus at I-96/I-696 north to 12 Mile Road. A plan enacted by then Governor John Engler in 1995 angered road officials when funding was diverted from county road commissions to help complete state highway projects like the M-5 (Haggerty Connector) project. In 1999, a second extension of M-5 was completed to 14 Mile Road, but only as an expressway. The final between 14 Mile Road and Pontiac Trail opened to traffic on November 1, 2002. =Bike trail= alt=Photograph In the mid-1970s, MDOT constructed a bike trail parallel to I-275 in response to the energy crisis. Since 2006, the Michigan Trails & Greenway Alliance and MDOT have been working to improve the bike trail. At the time of the alliance's initial studies, the trail was overgrown with vegetation in locations. Since a grand re-opening in 2011, the bike path has been called the I-275 Metro Trail. In the middle of 2015, MDOT completed reconstruction of the bike trail, resulting in a paved trail from a junction with the Downriver Linked Greenways East‚ÄìWest Trail near South Huron Road in Huron Township northward to 12 Mile Road in Novi.

Dionne attended teacher's college and taught in a variety of locations, including Baie-Comeau, Quebec, where he met his future wife, Precille. Dionne moved to the Miramichi to become principal of Millerton High School. Dionne was long active in Liberal Party of Canada circles, and was elected to the House of Commons of Canada, serving from 1974 to 1984 and again from 1988 to 1993. He lost his seat in 1984, when Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party of Canada won the largest landslide in terms of total seats in Canadian history. During these years out of office, he worked in the forestry industry in a consulting capacity. As a Member of Parliament, Dionne's major accomplishments were securing government assistance to aid expansion to the major pulp mill in the valley, securing the dredging of the entrance to the Miramichi River to enable ports there to continue receiving ocean-going vessels, and securing the construction of a federal maximum security prison at Renous in the valley. In 1992, Dionne called a press conference to announce that he was suffering from Alzheimer's Disease. This was one of the first occasions that a public figure made such an announcement, and it helped to create understanding of the affliction. Dionne did not run in the next election, and died in 2003. Dionne and his wife had two daughters and three sons.

On 1 March 1940, the Hungarian Army formed three field armies. All three Hungarian armies saw action on the Eastern Front against the Red Army. Unlike the Hungarian Third Army which took part in the invasion of Yugoslavia (1941) and the Hungarian Second Army that fought at the Battle of Stalingrad (1942), the Hungarian First Army did not see much combat at the start of the war. The troops of the Hungarian First Army, like all Hungarian troops, were part of the one-million- plus non-German Axis troops on the Eastern Front. While the majority of these Axis troops were Romanian, there were also significant contingents of Hungarians, Finns, Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Italians, Slovaks, Croatians, Frenchmen, Danes, Norwegians, Belgians, and Spaniards. Occupation duties The first commander of the Hungarian First Army was Lieutenant- General (or Alt√°bornagy according to the Hungarian army rank) Vilmos Nagy. After 30 August 1940, under Nagy, the Hungarian First Army took part in Hungary's annexation and occupation of northern Transylvania. This region of Romania was awarded to Hungary as a condition of the Second Vienna Award. From 1940 to mid-1944, the Hungarian First Army saw little action other than occupation duties. Action By 30 April 1944, the Hungarian First Army was used to bolster Army Group South Ukraine. This army group was pushed back during the Battle of T√¢rgul Frumos in May 1944. The Hungarians were placed in defensive positions north of the Romanian Fourth Army and south of Army Group North Ukraine. From 13 July to 29 July 1944, the Hungarian First Army fought against the Soviet Lvov-Sandomierz Offensive. At this time the Hungarians were attached to the German First Panzer Army commanded by Colonel-General (Generaloberst) Gotthard Heinrici, which, in turn, was part of Army Group North Ukraine. Hungarian soldiers in the Carpathians in 1944, near the village of Volosyanka Later in 1944, Soviet troops entered Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. The Romanians capitulated. The Bulgarians capitulated. The Hungarians tried to capitulate twice, but unsuccessfully. In the end, the Hungarian First Army continued its precarious existence. On 28 December, a newly formed Hungarian government, under acting Prime Minister B√©la Mikl√≥s, officially declared war against Nazi Germany. But the Germans and the pro-German Hungarians in Hungary fought on against the Soviets. However, there are indications that some elements of the Hungarian First Army went over to the Soviets at about this time. B√©la Mikl√≥s had been the commander of the Hungarian First Army from 1 August 1944 to 16 October 1944. Between 1 January and 16 February 1945, most of what remained of the Hungarian First Army was overrun, bypassed, or destroyed about 200 kilometers north of Budapest when the Soviet 40th Army advanced through the area. But, even after this, the Hungarian First Army did not cease to exist. The remnants fought on as an attachment to Heinrici's German First Panzer Army. Fighting as they went, they moved progressively westward into Slovakia. The army was not officially disbanded until 8 May 1945, the end of the war. That is when the last commander of the Hungarian First Army, Lieutenant-General L√°szl√≥ Dezs≈ë, surrendered.

Painting by William Barnes Wollen A forlorn hope is a band of soldiers or other combatants chosen to take the vanguard in a military operation, such as a suicidal assault through the kill zone of a defended position, where the risk of casualties is high. Such a band is also known as the (). Etymology The term comes from the Dutch , literally 'lost troop'. The term was used in military contexts to denote a troop formation. The Dutch word (in its sense of 'heap' in English) is not cognate with English 'hope': this is an example of folk etymology. The mistranslation of as \\"forlorn hope\\" is \\"a quaint misunderstanding\\" using the nearest-sounding English words. This false etymology has been strengthened by the fact that in Dutch, the word is a homograph meaning \\"hope\\" as well as \\"heap\\", though the two senses have different etymologies. History In the German mercenary armies of the , these troops were called the , which has the same meaning as the Dutch term, the word Haufen itself being a general term for a company of . These men carried long double-handed swords, with which they had to hew their way through the massive pike formations opposing them. They also had to withstand the first wave of attacks when defending a breastwork. Members of the ' earned double pay, thus giving them the name of Doppels√∂ldner ('Double-wagers'). Since there were not enough volunteers for this assignment, criminals who had been sentenced to death were taken into the ranks as well. As a field sign, the carried a red ('Blood Banner'). By extension, the term forlorn hope became used for any body of troops placed in a hazardous position, e.g., an exposed outpost, or the defenders of an outwork in advance of the main defensive position. This usage was especially common in accounts of the English Civil War, as well as in the British Army in the Peninsular War of 1808‚Äì1814. In the days of muzzle-loading muskets, the term was most frequently used to refer to the first wave of soldiers attacking a breach in defenses during a siege. While it was likely that most members of the forlorn hope would be killed or wounded, the intention was that some would survive long enough to seize a foothold that could be reinforced, or, at least, that a second wave with better prospects could be sent in while the defenders were reloading or engaged in mopping up the remnants of the first wave. That said, such soldiers were rarely suicidal or foolhardy: British troops of the forlorn hope at the 1812 Siege of Badajoz carried a large bag ( by in diameter) stuffed with hay or straw, which was thrown down into the enemy trenches to create a cushion and prevent injury as they jumped down. A forlorn hope may have been composed of volunteers and conscripted criminals, and were frequently led by ambitious junior officers with hopes of personal advancement: if the volunteers survived, and performed courageously, they would be expected to benefit in the form of promotions, cash gifts, and added glory to their name (a military tradition at least as old as the Roman Republic.Crowns were bestowed after a Roman triumph by generals to soldiers who won personal victories in battle... [such as being] first to scale a wall. Dio Cassius: Roman History 6.21 ) The commanding officer was virtually guaranteed both a promotion and a long-term boost to his career prospects if he survived. In consequence, despite the grave risks involved for all concerned, there was often serious competition for the opportunity to lead such an assault and to display conspicuous valor. The French equivalent of the forlorn hope, called ('The Lost Children'), were all guaranteed promotion to officer rank should they survive. Both enlisted men and officers joined the dangerous mission as an opportunity to raise themselves in the army.

He is nicknamed \\"The Condor\\" and runs the BMX Freestyle brand Hoffman BMX Bikes based out of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Career In 1983, when Hoffman was 11 years old, he competed in a contest in Madison Square Garden. He had learned to ride BMX on his own and did not have any other riders for reference. He remembers: \\"when I got to that contest I went 'woah, I guess I am going higher than everyone else'.\\" In 1987, at the age of 15, Hoffman became the youngest SPROO to join the freestyle BMX circuit. An article in Ride Magazine commented: \\"What's left to say about a guy who ignored all established limits and redefined vert riding ‚Äì at age 15[?]\\". He won the first contest he entered as a professional and took home a $2,200 check. In 1991, Hoffman attained the pro division and launched both Hoffman Promotions and Hoffman Bikes. He developed the Bicycle Stunt (BS) series to give riders a place to compete and to showcase their talents. ESPN joined with Hoffman Promotions in 1995 to produce and televise the series each year. The growth of Hoffman Promotions gave birth to the Hoffman Sports Association (H.S.A.), the organizing body for BMX Freestyle events worldwide, such as ESPN's X Games and all international X Games bicycle-stunt events. Hoffman has produced, directed and hosted several TV series for ESPN including Kids in the Way, HBtv, and Mat's World. In February 2008, Hoffman produced and co-hosted Mat Hoffman's Evel Knievel Tribute with Johnny Knoxville, which aired on MTV and featured record-breaking stunts by Travis Pastrana, Trigger Gunn, Allan Cooke and Davin Halford. He has had involvement in a number of film projects, such as: * Aggroman (1989) * Keep Your Eyes Open, produced by Tamra Davis and starring Spike Jonze * IMAX film Ultimate X * XXX, a Rob Cohen film, starring Vin Diesel * Jackass: The Movie * Jackass Number Two * Jackass 3D An ESPN 30 for 30 documentary entitled The Birth of Big Air, directed and produced by Jeff Tremaine, Johnny Knoxville, Spike Jonze and Hoffman himself, was released in July 2010. Past projects include two shows produced by Hoffman ‚Äì Mat Hoffman's Aggro Circus at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, and Mat Hoffman's Danger Defying Daredevils at Six Flags Magic Mountain near Los Angeles, California. The book The Ride of My Life documents Hoffman's story through 2001. =Video games= Hoffman worked with Activision to produce the video games Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX (2001) and Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX 2 (2002), the latter released in conjunction with the Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX2 Tour TV show, which aired on ESPN2 and is available on DVD and VHS. Hoffman also appeared as an unlockable playable character in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 (2002) and Tony Hawk's American Wasteland (2005), also produced by Activision. Achievements Hoffman is responsible for building the sport for decades, providing support to the biggest names in the industry, including Dave Mirra, Jay Miron, Kevin Robinson, Chad Kagy, Seth Kimbrough, Taj Mihelich, Brad Simms, Anthony Napolitan, Mike Escamilla, Rick Thorne, Kevin Jones, Chase Gouin,Pete Augustin Day Smith, Art Thomason, among others. Hoffman and his team were selected to take part in the closing ceremonies of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia in a production called \\"Sport as Art.\\" In 1999, H.S.A. developed Mat Hoffman's Crazy Freakin' Bikers Series (CFB), which provides amateur and professional Freestyle bikers a venue in which they can compete. Not only does the H.S.A. promote, organize and host the series, but it also produces all the television programming for the CFB Series, which is aired on ESPN2. The H.S.A. organizes BMX Freestyle portions of annual U.S. and international events, including the X Games and all international X Games qualifiers. The year 2005 marked the 14th consecutive year of competition production for Hoffman Promotions. In 2001, Hoffman competed at the X Games, earning the bronze medal. He stunned the industry and fans, alike, when he set another record by successfully completing the first-ever No-handed 900 at the 2002 X Games, resulting in the silver medal. Hoffman was the first person to ride an oversized (\\"Big\\") ramp in 1993 with his first High Air attempt off of a 24-foot quarter pipe. On one of his runs, he tore his spleen, and had he not gotten to a hospital within five minutes, he would have died. When Hoffman achieved 26.6 feet above the ramp in March 1999 to 2001, he had a team of four professional photographers, an elaborate scaffolding system to record the attempt at different angles and had an ABC Wide World of Sports camera crew on-site. Hoffman is also credited with being the first person to perform a double peg grind down a handrail, as documented in the video Head First, released in 1991. The trick has gone on to be a foundation of modern-day street riding. In 2005, Hoffman was elected the President of the International BMX Freestyle Federation, the international governing body of BMX Freestyle.

From the mainland the island is inconspicuous and almost hidden. It is possible to drive or walk across a large sandy strand to the island by following the arrowed signs. At high tide, the water is deep enough to cover a car. HistoryMonastic heritage= Fahy Lake, Omey Island In the early-to-mid-1990s a team of archaeologists from University College Dublin began work to study the monastic heritage of the island, long known for being the site of a monastery and settlement reportedly founded by the prodigious St Feichin. In fact, its name derives from the Irish Iomaidh Feich√≠n meaning Feich√≠n's bed or seat. The excavation gave new insights into the life of early Christianity in Ireland and included one of the few known burials of a woman within a monastic burial ground. The site is believed to date from the early 6th century. The island of Omey remains a place of devotion to Saint Feich√≠n to this day, with a Holy Well situated by the western edge and several other key landmarks of piety. This includes a later medieval parish church - with the majority of its vast stones still very much in place (having been buried in centuries of sand until the parish priest took matters into his own hands and, with the help of locals, dug up the area surrounding it). St Feich√≠n is reported to have established many such communities across the west of Ireland and is considered one of the most important of the early founders of the rich tradition of Irish Christianity. =Late Medieval and Modern times= The O'Tooles of Leinster settled here in the early 1500s, under the protection of the O'Flahertys. During the Cromwellian settlements the Browns and D'Arcys took over. In the early 1800s two townlands on Omey belonged to the Martins of Ballynahinch and one to the D'Arcys of Clifden. John MacNeice, a Church of Ireland bishop famous for his opposition to the Ulster Covenant was born and raised on Omey. A description of the desolate island appeared in Duffy's Hibernian Magazine: \\"Can there be anything to distinguish that flat unpicturesque abode of misery from any other spot in which human wretchedness prevails along the most desolate tracts of the Irish coast? We answer, yes: that poor unfavoured island in the remote west, nearly half the surface of which is covered by a lough and spewy marsh, while the other half is little better than drifting sand, the scanty vegetation on which is frequently blasted by the ‚Äúred wind‚Äù of the Atlantic‚Äîthat island, we say, has a history of its own. It was the ‚ÄúImagia insula‚Äù of the old Latin hagiologists, and was, as far as we know, the very last spot in which paganism lingered in Ireland. In the latter half of the seventh century, St. Feichin, the holy abbot of Fore, in Westmeath, found the inhabitants of Omey still pagans, and encountered violent opposition from them when building a monastery there...\\" Duffy's Hibernian Magazine, Vol. 1-3, 1860 During the winter of 1880-81, Bernard Henry Becker, correspondent for the Daily Mail, toured Ireland and wrote about Omey Island: \\"Over against the inhabited part of the island is what is now a mere sandbank. It is covered with sand, and not a soul dwells thereon. But there were people there once who clung in their stone cabins till the sand finally covered them; so that they might fairly be described as dwellers or burrowers therein... Now I have seen superb potatoes grown literally in the sand at Scheveningen, and was not surprised to hear that Omey Island was once so famous for the national staff of life that few cared to grow anything else. But there are difficulties everywhere, and it is parlous work to break up ground at Omey. There is too much fresh air; for it blows so hard that people are afraid to disturb the thin covering of herbage which overspreads the best part of the island. 'If ye break the shkin of 'um, your honour, the wind blows the sand away and leaves your pitaties bare. And, begorra, there are nights when the pitaties themselves 'ud be blown away. Statements like this must be taken at a reduction, but, judging from my own experience, Omey is a 'grand place for the weather entirely.'\\" Bernard Henry Becker, \\"Disturbed Ireland; Being the Letters Written During the Winter of 1880-81,\\" Macmillan & Co., London, 1881. Places of interest In several places shell middens can be found on the island. Some of those have been carbon-dated to AD 1000‚Äì1500. The ruin of Teampaill Feichin, the medieval parish church, excavated from the sand in 1981, stands on the site of the abbey said to have been founded by Saint Feich√≠n.

The smaller the bend radius, the greater is the material flexibility (as the radius of curvature decreases, the curvature increases). The diagram to the right illustrates a cable with a seven- centimeter bend radius. Cable with a seven-centimeter bend radius The minimum bend radius is the radius below which an object such as a cable should not be bent. Fiber optics The minimum bend radius is of particular importance in the handling of fiber-optic cables, which are often used in telecommunications. The minimum bending radius will vary with different cable designs. The manufacturer should specify the minimum radius to which the cable may safely be bent during installation, and for the long term. The former is somewhat larger than the latter. The minimum bend radius is in general also a function of tensile stresses, e.g., during installation, while being bent around a sheave while the fiber or cable is under tension. If no minimum bend radius is specified, one is usually safe in assuming a minimum long-term low- stress radius not less than 15 times the cable diameter, or 2 inches. Beside mechanical destruction, another reason why one should avoid excessive bending of fiber-optic cables is to minimize microbending and macrobending losses. Microbending causes light attenuation induced by deformation of the fiber while macrobending causes the leakage of light through the fiber cladding and this is more likely to happen where the fiber is excessively bent.

The island is a tourist destination, which has increased in popularity since the opening of the Hindmarsh Island bridge in 2001. Hindmarsh Island is south east of the Adelaide city centre, around a 1-hour and 15 minute drive.  History  Prior to European colonisation, the island was occupied by Aboriginal tribes of the Ngarrindjeri people. Plaque of a monument dedicated to Charles Sturt and Collet Barker on the island, erected in 1930. 1830: The first European to set foot on Hindmarsh Island was Captain Charles Sturt. Sturt used the Island as a viewing point and from there he sighted the Murray Mouth. 1831: Captain Collet Barker surveyed the Murray Mouth but was killed by Indigenous Australians after swimming across the mouth. Captain Charles Sturt, first European to set foot on Hindmarsh Island in 1830. 1837: The island was named by Captain John William Dundas Blenkinsop after South Australia's first Governor, Sir John Hindmarsh. 1849: Dr. John Rankine was granted an occupational licence to become the island's first grazier. His nephew James Rankine was an early and longtime settler. 1853: Charles Price purchased section 20 () on the island. 1856: A flour mill was constructed. 1857: A signal mast was erected at Barker Knoll to convey safe passage condition messages to vessels wishing to pass through the mouth. 1858: A public ferry began operations between Goolwa and the island. In the same year the first inter colonial telegraph line passed through the island to link Adelaide with Melbourne. 1861: The cemetery was surveyed. 1880s: Alberto and Selberto Forest were planted. 1868: Hereford cattle and Shropshire sheep arrived in South Australia, when Charles Price introduced them onto the island. 1900: A cheese factory was established by Percy Heggaton. 1914: An experimental barrage was constructed to link Hindmarsh Island with Mundoo Island. 1935: Construction of the permanent barrages took place with the aim of maintaining a consistent water level around the river Port of Goolwa and keeping salt water from the northern shore improving agricultural opportunities. 1965: Mains electricity arrived on the island 1970: Little penguins were present on Hindmarsh Island. Today, the colony is extinct. Wiebken, A. Conservation Priorities for Little Penguin Populations in Gulf St Vincent SARDI, South Australia (June 2011).

Present: Hindmarsh Island today has fresh water on its northern shore and salt water on the southern shores, the waters being separated by a series of barrages.  The Hindmarsh Island Bridge  Length: Height: Width: Clearance Height: Building Company: Built Environs Construction Commenced: October 1999 Construction Finished: March 2001 View of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge from the Goolwa wharf. March 4, 2001 saw the official opening of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge linking the island to Goolwa. The bridge became a focus of national controversy when a group of local Indigenous people (the Ngarrindjeri) and some landowners objected to its construction. It was alleged that the Ngarrindjeri objectors fabricated the cultural significance of the island (the Secret Women's Business) in order to help fight the development. A later Royal Commission decided that the Secret Women's Business was made up. Construction was blocked by the Keating Government but given the go-ahead by the Howard Government in 1996. Five years after the Royal Commission findings, the Ngarrindjeri who had stated the bridge desecrated sites sacred to women were vindicated. Federal Court Judge, Mr Justice John von Doussa, in Chapman v Luminis Pty Ltd (No 5) found that \\"the evidence received by the Court on this topic is significantly different to that which was before the Royal Commission. Upon the evidence before this Court I am not satisfied that the restricted women's knowledge was fabricated or that it was not part of genuine Aboriginal tradition'.. Further, Justice von Doussa found the nine Ngarrindjeri women who testified about their beliefs to be 'credible witnesses who genuinely hold the beliefs and recollections expressed by them'.

The Nova television programme Nazi Prison Escape, a shortened cut of a British documentary series, was based on his books about Colditz. He spent 10 years in Soviet-ordered imprisonment following the war and was released in 1955.  Pre-World War II  In March 1913, Eggers was called up for military service and was, on his request, posted to the 2nd Battalion of Marine Infantry (Seebataillon) at Wilhelmshaven. His battalion commander was the famed Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck, who after six months personally promoted Eggers to Gefreiter. Eggers completed his training on 31 March 1914 and was promoted to the rank of Unteroffizier. After the outbreak of World War I he was ordered to join the First Regiment of Marine Infantry at Kiel. He was subsequently posted on the western front where he won the Iron Cross Second Class on 8 May 1915, the Iron Cross First Class and the Hesse Medal for bravery on the Somme in December 1915. To cope with the Weimar Republic's hyperinflation in the 1920s he had to sell his whole fortune which amounted to little more than 10,000 marks. Eggers and his wife bought an acre and a half of land at Reideburg. When conditions had somewhat stabilised he decided to start studying to regain his post as a teacher. In his years as a high-school teacher in the 1930s he promoted international relations and visited Britain and France with his students. He failed to anticipate the untrustworthiness of his fellow teachers, however, and in 1933 he was denounced by six of his colleagues to the Nazis who accused him of being a left-winger and an internationalist. He was consequently only allowed to teach at elementary school. In 1934 he received his PhD from Halle University. World War II and Colditz In 1939 he was recalled to the army as a reserve lieutenant. Because of his language skills he was sent to Oflag IV-A Hohnstein as a translator. The POWs at Hohnstein were mostly French officers, including 28 generals and an additional seven Dutch and 27 Polish generals. Eggers felt his experiences at this camp were poor preparation for his time at Colditz. POWs and guards treated each other with respect and there were no real problems or friction. On 22 November 1940, Eggers received his orders to report to Oflag IV-C, Colditz. He started as LO3 (Lager Offizier 3 or duty officer) and was faced with rebellious, anti- German POWs from Poland, France and the UK, who took every opportunity to harass their captors. Later these were joined by Belgian, Dutch and American officers. Eggers tended to treat his opponents as difficult schoolboys and always tried to retain his calm and dignity even when provoked to the utmost. On one occasion his cap was stolen by a POW (to be measured and copied for an escape). He calmly waited for a guard to get a new one before he left the building. British and Dutch officers agreed that Eggers always treated them correctly. Lieutenant Damiaen J. van Doorninck, a former Dutch POW, wrote in his foreword for Eggers's book that: > This man was our opponent, but nevertheless he earned our respect by his > correct attitude, self-control and total lack of rancour despite all the > harassment we gave him. On 1 June 1941, Eggers was promoted to Hauptmann. In February 1944, he became the Security Officer for the camp, a post he retained until the camp was liberated by the U.S. Army in April 1945.  After Colditz  After the liberation of Colditz Castle by the U.S. Army, Eggers retired from active service and returned to his post as a teacher in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, as he was able to prove that he had never joined the Nazi Party. He became a headmaster and then a lecturer at Halle University. In September 1946, as he was in the Soviet Occupied Zone, he was arrested by the Soviets and questioned about Gestapo agents in Colditz. Charged with crimes against humanity, spying and supporting a fascist regime, he was sentenced to ten years of labour. This was spent in Sachsenhausen and then Torgau Prison. Eggers was in later years active in meeting with former Colditz inmates and writing his memoirs. He retired to live by Lake Constance, where he died in 1974, aged 84.

In a promotion of the human rights of the Uyghur people, the Rafto Foundation published a book, ‚ÄúIn Our World of Good and Evil‚Äù, (2006) and assisted in a production of a documentary, ‚ÄúOn a tightrope‚Äù (2006). In 2000, Kim Dae-jung was awarded the Rafto Prize for his tireless fight for democracy and human rights in Korea. Since that time, the Rafto Foundation provides a significant contribution to the annual international conferences held in Bergen, Norway. The foundation supported also a production of a documentary film, ‚ÄúYODOK Stories‚Äù about Yodok concentration camp in North Korea. In 1999, Gennady Grushevoy was awarded the Rafto Prize for his brave work for democracy and human rights under the Lukashenko dictatorship in Belarus. Together with the Norwegian film company Piraya Film, a documentary film, ‚ÄúBelarusian Waltz‚Äù, was released in 2007. The film tells the incredible story of a Belurussian painter and performance artist, Alexander Pushkin, and his brave challenges to President Lukashenko‚Äôs authoritarian regime. In 1994, Leyla Zana, the Kurdish Parliamentarian, became the Rafto Prize laureate for her struggle for the human rights of the Kurdish people in Turkey and the neighbouring countries. In her struggle for freedom, Leyla Zana has become a symbol of a peaceful resolution to the Kurdish conflict in Turkey. The Rafto Foundation took an active role in establishing the EU Turkey Civic Commission and series of conferences in Brussels, on the Kurdish minority rights. In 1990, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Rafto Prize for her peaceful struggle under a military dictatorship. Since 1990 Burma has become one of the main follow up projects of the Rafto Foundation. A close work with the Burmese community in Norway made the Rafto Foundation to take an initiative in setting up of the Norwegian Burma Committee, which at the moment is based in Oslo and runs independently from the Rafto Foundation. History Thorolf Rafto was well known for his political activism in Eastern Europe, especially in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland. During a visit to Prague in 1979 to hold a lecture for students excluded from universities for political reasons, Rafto was arrested and brutally beaten up by the communist security police. Inflicted injuries dramatically weakened his health. On 4 November 1986 Thorolf Rafto died. However, his friends and colleagues agreed to establish a foundation that would continue the Rafto‚Äôs work on a promotion of freedom of speech and political expression in Eastern Europe. It was also decided to introduce a prize for human right activists. Nevertheless, the fall of the Iron Curtain and the consequential democratization of Eastern European states made to reconsider the status of the foundation. Meanwhile it has opened new possibilities to work with other geographical regions in a promotion of human rights. Already in 1990, the Rafto Prize was awarded to a Burmese democratic leader, Aung San Suu Kyi that in the following year 1991 has received the Nobel Peace Prize for her non- violent struggle for democracy and human rights. For the first years, the foundation was based at the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration. From 1997, the Rafto foundation was relocated to the Human Rights House of Bergen. The Human Right House was established in a memory of Thorolf Rafto‚Äôs son, journalist Egil Rafto (1951-1997) and officially was opened in 1999 by Kim Aris, the youngest son of Burmese diplomat Aung San Suu Kyi and British historian Michael Aris (1946‚Äì1999). Beside the Rafto Foundation, several organisations have permanent offices in the house, such as Amnesty International, AFS Intercultural Learning, M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res, Norwegian Church Aid's Youth, while other groups use the house for seminars, meetings and social events. Education Educational projects are given a high priority too. The house seeks to be a centre of Human Rights expertise, which can serve as a focal point in the local network and take on a coordinating role between the local and the international network. In August, 2008 the Rafto Foundation organised an exhibition and a roundtable on Poverty and Human Rights (with the example of Dalits) for the Summer Research School of the University of Bergen. Among the invited speakers were the 2007 Rafto Prize laureates, National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights.

The new visa policy put in place in 2000, it was claimed, dispensed with safeguards against abuses such as illegal immigration and human trafficking in favour of speeding up the issuing process for tourist visas. The affair prompted the resignation of the responsible Minister of State Ludger Volmer of the Green party from his roles in the Bundestag foreign affairs committee and as foreign affairs spokesperson of his party. The claims severely damaged the reputation of his party colleague, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. The allegation was that changes had been made to the previous tougher visa rules, without correct political procedure. Some commentators have suggested that the increase in the number of Ukrainians visiting Germany may have promoted a more positive view of Western Europe, assisting the Orange Revolution.  Background  1999/2000 = In 1999 the German embassy in Kiev, Ukraine alone issued more than 150,000 visas for Germany. Long queues formed in front of the embassy. Applicants reported that Ukrainian security personnel demanded DM 100 to 500 (‚Ç¨50 - 250) from applicants to get ahead in the queue. At the beginning of 2000, the Minister of State at the Federal Foreign Office, Ludger Volmer, issued a decree (known as \\"Volmer's Decree\\"), which extended the powers of the individual embassies in deciding about visa applications. The decree aimed at making travel to Germany easier. When in doubt, the application was to be decided in favour of the applicant. At the same time, visa applications directly from travel agencies were introduced. This regulation was opposed by the Bundesgrenzschutz (Federal Border Guard) as well as by the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), because they feared that it would lead to easier migration into Germany for criminals. They cited a criminal court decision against the manager of a travel agency who organized illegal migration into Germany. The \\"tourists\\", in this case; went underground, became prostitutes or left Germany for other countries of the European Union. On March 9, 2000, the Minister of the Interior, Otto Schily (SPD) wrote a letter to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Joschka Fischer, saying that he saw the \\"Volmer's Decree\\" as a violation of the Aliens Act as well as of the Schengen Treaty. As of 2005, it is not clear if Schily intervened further, or if not, why? =2001 - 2003= On May 2, 2001 embassies worldwide were advised to accept the Carnet de Touriste travel insurance introduced by Helmut Kohl's CDU in 1995. These insurance documents covered medical costs incurred abroad as well as any costs resulting from deportation. They were accepted in place of a written guarantee by a German citizen to prove that the visa applicant could finance his stay and his return home. The German Automobile Club (ADAC) sold between 120,000 and 150,000 of these insurance documents, the Allianz insurance company sold more than 35,000, and the ITREC GmbH company more than 31,000. The Foreign Office also advised the embassies to accept similar travel insurance documents from the Reiseschutz AG, owned by private entrepreneur K√ºbler. The press claims this played an important role in the smuggling of people into Germany. The Ministry of the Interior was informed about this by the Federal Crime Agency (Bundeskriminalamt). In the trial of Anatoli Barg, the Cologne criminal court claimed that the \\"Volmer's Decree\\", the acceptance of travel insurance documents instead of guarantors or proof of credit-worthiness and the applications for visas at travel agencies had led to mass human trafficking. In the verdict, this was described as \\"a cold putsch against the law\\". In July, 2001, the Foreign Office prevented applications for visas at travel agencies from October 1, 2001. Instead of going to a travel agency, once more every applicant had to go to the visa department in an embassy. However, it was assumed that a travel insurance document sufficed as proof of the applicant's credit-worthiness. From January 29, 2002 the Foreign Office decreed that it was possible to buy and sell travel insurance documents directly in foreign countries. It is said in the press that this increased the problems in Kiev and that traders sold travel insurance documents for as much as $1,000. On February 8, 2002 the German ambassador in Kiev, Dietmar St√ºdemann, reported that the embassy was flooded with applicants proving their credit-worthiness with travel insurance documents. In March 2003, \\"Volmer's Decree\\" later called the \\"Fischer degree\\"-since it was his responsibility, was cancelled. Once more, applicants' credit-worthiness had to be examined. From April 2003, travel insurance documents were no longer accepted. In February 2004, a German regional court found the defendant, Ukrainian-born Anatoli Barg, guilty of people trafficking and smuggling. The court found that laxness in issuing German visas in Ukraine, where about 300,000 tourist visas were issued to visit Germany between 2000 and 2002, made it easier for Barg to commit his offenses.Richard Bernstein (April 26, 2005), Fischer accepts blame in visa affair International Herald Tribune. =2005= On January 20, 2005 the first meeting of the Commission of Inquiry was held in the German Bundestag. This commission‚Äîa kind of judicial hearing‚Äîwas set up with the votes of the opposition parties CDU and CSU. The CDU/CSU parliamentary group was represented by Eckart von Klaeden. On February 12, 2005 Ludger Volmer retired as the Speaker for Foreign Affairs of the Green Party's parliamentary group in the Bundestag, after the media criticized his work as a consultant for the company Synthesis GmbH, which worked for the Bundesdruckerei, the agency privatized in 1994, producing identity cards, banknotes and other secure documents. For the first time in over six years, in February 2005, opinion polls did not show Joschka Fischer in first place in the popularity vote. Instead, the leading position in the popularity vote went to the Christian Democratic Ministerpr√§sident of Lower Saxony, Christian Wulff, with Fischer coming in second. On February 15, Fischer agreed to testify before the special parliamentary commission.Richard Bernstein (February 16, 2005), German Foreign Minister to Testify to Parliament in Visa Scandal International Herald Tribune.

In March 2005, during his first trip to Berlin since being sworn in, President Viktor Yushchenko of Ukraine in a speech before the German Bundestag asked for a visa-free regime for business people, students, artists and young people seeking contact with EU countries.Judy Dempsey (March 10, 2005), Yushchenko courts the Germans International Herald Tribune. On March 22, 2005 the media reported that the Federal Chancellery had been informed about a dispute between Otto Schily and Joschka Fischer about visa politics as early as March 2000. It was said that Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der himself was not informed. On March 26, 2005 Eckart von Klaeden called for Joschka Fischer to tell the truth before the elections in North Rhine-Westphalia. The CDU/CSU tried to force a statement by Fischer. On March 31, 2005 the media reported that Fischer would speak before the Inquiry Commission in mid-April, earlier than previously expected. The testimony of SPD minister of the interior Otto Schily was scheduled for June. In April 2005 the media reported that there were difficulties in 2004. Fischer claimed the difficulties were resolved in mid-2004. Eckart von Klaeden said on the main German television channel ZDF that the Commission of Inquiry wanted to investigate the differing statement of Fischer in March 2005. On April 21, the Commission of Inquiry heard Ludger Volmer and the State Secretary at the Foreign Office at the time, Gunter Pleuger. This Commission of Inquiry hearing (duration: more than 12 hours) was the first such hearing broadcast by television (and was watched by more than 400,000 people). At a second all-day televised hearing on 25 April 2005, Fischer admitted that mistakes had been made during his time in office when thousands of visas to Germany were granted to criminals and prostitutes from the Ukraine from 2000 to 2002.Richard Bernstein (April 26, 2005), Fischer accepts blame in visa affair International Herald Tribune. But Fischer also dismissed opposition arguments that the security and well-being of Germany were significantly harmed by the influx of immigrants, and he contended that once the problem was discovered in 2002 the policy was immediately corrected.Richard Bernstein (April 26, 2005), Fischer accepts blame in visa affair International Herald Tribune. Fischer's decision to admit some responsibility came after weeks of stonewalling by his party, which had even tried to delay appearing before the special parliamentary commission.Judy Dempsey (April 28, 2005), Fischer admits to visa-scandal errors International Herald Tribune. The hearing lasted 14 hours and was viewed by 700,000 viewers on Phoenix only, a 10.5% quota. After the hearing, members of the CDU/CSU continued to ask for Fischers retirement, whereas members of SPD and The Greens said that Fischer performed well and that the CDU/CSU members in the commission were not able to show evidence for their accusations. On 29 April, the Foreign Office passed the relevant documents to the European Commission, following months of pressure.Lisbeth Kirk (May 2, 2005), German visa scandal moves to EU level EUobserver. In May 2005, the German ambassador to Ukraine said the visa policies of Fischer were lax and eased the application of visas. He also said that the Volmer Decree discouraged the embassy's employees. On June 2, 2005, the Commission of Inquiry was adjourned after a short session of only 30 minutes. The commission called an end to the hearing of evidence with the majority of its SPD/The Greens members. CDU and FDP on the other hand are likely to appeal to the Constitutional Court should this matter be dropped permanently. Some ministers, who were due to appear before the commission (e.g. Otto Schily or others Frank-Walter Steinmeier of the Federal Chancellory), were not to be questioned in the end. Instead, the work of the commission was prematurely ended due to the widely anticipated call for an early election. On June 15, 2005, in a provisional ruling, the Constitutional Court considered the end of the hearings of evidence, as mentioned above on June 2, as unconstitutional and ordered the Commission of Inquiry to continue with its timetable as planned as long as the Federal Diet isn't dissolved due to the expected call for a snap election later this summer. This would mean the cancelled hearings of ministers like Schily (Minister of the Interior) and Steinmeier (Minister of State of the Federal Chancellory) will most likely take place after all. On August 4, the European Commission decided that while the lax system at the heart of the German visa scandal violated European Union norms (including the Schengen Agreement and the Common Consular Instructions), Germany had since remedied the problem with a reformed policy that complies with EU rules.EU All But Clears Germany in Visa Affair Deutsche Welle, August 4, 2005.

The youngest of their three sons, Denham was educated at Merchant Taylors' School from 1794 to 1800; on leaving he was articled to a solicitor, but joined the army in 1811.Cunningham, G. G. (1837). Lives of eminent and illustrious Englishmen. Vol. VII, 1837. Fullarton, Glasgow. Military career Initially in the 23rd Royal Welch Fusiliers, and later the 54th Foot, Denham served in the campaigns in Portugal, Spain, France, and Belgium, receiving the Waterloo Medal.

(London, 1892), by Dr Robert Brown Denham was considered a brave soldier, who had carried his wounded commander out of the line of fire at the Battle of Toulouse, and had become a close acquaintance of the Duke of Wellington, with whom he regularly corresponded. At the end of hostilities, Lieutenant Denham served at Cambray and with the occupation of Paris. Placed on half pay in 1818, he travelled for a time in France and Italy.Chichester, H. M. (1885), in Leslie Stephen, ed. Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900. Vol. 14, Denham, Dixon. Smith, Elder & Co., London. In 1819, Denham entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, as a student, intending to become a staff officer in the Senior Department of the Royal Military College.Army Lists, 1819-1821 He attracted the favourable attention of the Commandant of the College, Sir Howard Douglas, but became very bored; 'he was the kind of man who must have adventure or he rots', wrote a friend. Alas, he was also domineering, insecure, jealous, and possessed of a mean streak.Kryza, F. T. (2007). The Race for Timbuktu. Harper Collins, New York. . The Bornu Mission Denham had met the explorer Captain George Lyon on the latter's return to London from Africa, and became determined to join the British government's second mission to establish trade links with the west African states. Perhaps because of his influential acquaintances, Denham's wish was granted and, now promoted to Major, he was despatched by Lord Bathurst in the autumn of 1821 to join the other members of the mission, Dr Walter Oudney and Lt. Hugh Clapperton, arriving at Tripoli aboard the schooner Express on 19 November. Denham brought with him instructions from the Colonial Office indicating that Oudney should remain at Bornu as Vice-Consul, while Denham and Clapperton were to 'explore the Country to the Southward and Eastward of Bornu, principally with a view to tracing the course of the Niger and ascertaining its Embouchure'. For reasons unknown, Denham was detained in Tripoli, and the mission proceeded to Murzuk, in Fezzan, without him on 23 February 1822. Denham eventually left Tripoli on 5 March with an escort of 210 mounted Arab tribesmen, reaching Murzuk only to find his two compatriots in a wretched condition, Clapperton ill of an ague, and Oudney with a severe cold. Moreover, he discovered that the local bey had forbidden their departure from the Fezzan while he was absent on a slave- raiding expedition, a restriction enforced by the removal of the mission's camels. Denham soon returned to Tripoli, to seek further funds, and to persuade the bashaw, Yusuf Karamanli, to provide the essential escort to protect the mission on its journey south to Bornu. He arrived back in Tripoli on 13 June 1822, his departure from the mission unlamented. He had already made himself unpopular, leading Clapperton to write to Sir John Barrow: 'His absence will be no loss to the Mission, and a saving to his country, for Major Denham could not read his sextant, knew not a star in the heavens, and could not take the altitude of the sun'. Denham was to find the bashaw as obdurate as Murzuk's bey. Outraged, he decided to return to London to report the situation to Lord Bathurst and also seek promotion, so that he could return as commanding officer of the expedition. Boarding a ship bound for Marseilles, he warned the bashaw's lieutenants of his government's displeasure when it learned of the bashaw's 'duplicity'. Duly alarmed, the bashaw wrote to him, proposing that the 300man escort of a wealthy merchant about to depart for Bornu could, for a fee of 10,000 dollars to be shared with him, be persuaded to protect the mission as well. Denham received the letter while in quarantine in Marseilles. Still very angry, he sent an ill-judged letter to Bathurst complaining of Oudney's incompetence. The missal was not well received in London, and Denham found a letter awaiting him on his return to Tripoli, rebuking him for his lack of diplomacy, although acknowledging the frustrations he had endured. News of Denham's conduct left his compatriots at Murzuk dumbfounded. Oudney wrote a bitter letter of complaint about Denham to Hanmer Warrington, the British Consul in Tripoli, comparing Denham to a snake hidden in the grass. In an unfortunate breach of confidence, Warrington showed the letter to Denham, thereby souring relations within the mission party still further. By the end of September 1822, Denham was on his way back to Murzuk with the merchant and the promised escort. Recognizing that matters had been aggravated by the absence of any official instruction regarding leadership of the expedition, the Colonial Office wrote that Clapperton should become Oudney's aide, not Denham's. The mission, now comprising four Britons (including Hillman, the carpenter), five servants, and four camel drivers, eventually left Murzuk for Bornu on 19 November 1822. Clapperton and Oudney were in poor health, having succumbed to fevers, and all were overwrought as they made their way due south across the Sahara, the route littered with the skeletal remains of slaves that had perished of thirst. The mission reached the northern shore of Lake Chad on 4 February 1823, the Britons becoming the first white men to see the lake; the party continued westward, reaching Kuka in the Bornu Empire, (now Kukawa, Nigeria) on 17 February. Denham and Clapperton received by Sheikh al-Kaneimi at Kuka It was from Kuka that Denham, against the wishes of Oudney and Clapperton, accompanied a slave-raiding expedition into the Mandara Mountains south of Bornu. The raiders were defeated, and Denham barely escaped with his life. By this time, a deep antipathy had developed between Clapperton and Denham, Denham secretly sending home malicious reports about Clapperton having homosexual relations with one of the Arab servants. The accusation, based on a rumour spread by a disgruntled servant dismissed by Clapperton for theft, was almost certainly unfounded, and Denham later withdrew it but without telling Clapperton he had done so, leading the historian Bovill to observe that 'it remains difficult to recall in all the checkered (sic) history of geographic discovery.... a more odious man than Dixon Denham'.Bovill, E. W. (ed.) (1966). Missions to the Niger. Vols. II - IV. The Bornu Mission, 1822-25. Cambridge University Press. After quarrelling again over leadership of the party, Oudney and Clapperton set out for the Hausa states in December 1823, while Denham remained behind to explore the western, southern and south-eastern shores of Lake Chad and the lower courses of the rivers Waube, Logone and Shari. He was unable to survey the eastern shore owing to the warring tribes there, but nevertheless proved beyond doubt that Lake Chad was not the source of the Niger, as had been widely believed. Denham was briefly aided in his surveys by a 21-year-old ensign, Ernest Toole, sent from Malta to assist him. However Toole, already weakened by the arduous desert crossing from Tripoli, soon died of fever, and was buried by Denham on the shores of the lake. Denham returned to Kuka, where he met Warrington's protege, John Tyrwhitt, sent to act as vice-consul there. Denham took Tyrwhitt with him on an excursion to the southern tip of the Lake Chad. When the pair returned to Kuka, Denham found Clapperton there, all but unrecognizable. Oudney had died at Murmur in January 1824, but Clapperton had continued to Kano and Sokoto; forbidden to continue further by Sultan Bello, he had had no option but to return. On 14 September 1824, their antipathy unabated, the pair, with carpenter Hillman, left Kuka for Tripoli not speaking a word to each other during the 133-day journey. Tyrwhitt elected to remain at Kuka and do his duty, a decision that cost him his life only several months later after he succumbed to fever, alcoholism, and loneliness. Denham and Clapperton returned to England and a heroes' reception on 1 June 1825. Aftermath Within three months of their return, Clapperton had left on another expedition to west Africa, this time travelling by sea, leaving Denham to write of their exploits in which he exaggerated his own role and minimized the contributions of Clapperton and Oudney without fear of contradiction. Scans from the Internet Archive: Volume 1, Volume 2 Denham took up residence in London, at 18 George Street, Hanover Square.The Wellington Papers, 1825. Hartley Library, Southampton University. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society,Hare, J. (2003). Shadows across the Sahara. I. B. Tauris, London. ; and in December that year, promoted to lieutenant-colonel, he sailed for Sierra Leone as Superintendent of Liberated Africans, charged with resettling the slaves rescued by the British naval squadron and landed at Freetown. Denham spent some months surveying the neighbourhood of Freetown, and towards the end of the year started on a visit of inspection to Fernando Po, where the British leased bases for their anti-slavery patrols. It was there that he learned from Richard Lander the news of Clapperton's death at Sokoto, which he duly relayed to London. In May 1828 Denham returned to Freetown, where he received the royal warrant appointing him lieutenant-governor of the colony of Sierra Leone, succeeding Sir Neil Campbell who had died in office there.Urban (ed.) (1828). The Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. 144, p.184, London. Death After administering Sierra Leone for only five weeks, Denham died of 'African Fever' (probably malaria) at Freetown on 9 June 1828, aged 42. The fourth governor of the colony to perish in as many years in that 'pestilential climate', he died owing several thousand pounds to his brother, John Charles. Denham was buried at the city's Circular Road cemetery on 15 June. Personal life Denham married Harriet Hawkins, a widow, in Lisbon whilst serving in the Peninsular Wars. The marriage was solemnized in London at St Paul's, Covent Garden on 20 February 1815, but no further record of his wife or any issue survives. Denham in literature Denham's exploits are briefly mentioned in Jules Verne's Five Weeks in a Balloon, Chapter 30: 'My dear fellow, we are now upon the very track of Major Denham. It was at this very city of Mosfeia that he was received by the Sultan of Mandara; he had quitted the Bornou country; he accompanied the sheik in an expedition against the Fellatahs; he assisted in the attack on the city, which, with its arrows alone, bravely resisted the bullets of the Arabs, and put the sheik's troops to flight. All this was but a pretext for murders, raids, and pillage. The major was completely plundered and stripped, and had it not been for his horse, under whose stomach he clung with the skill of an Indian rider, and was borne with a headlong gallop from his barbarous pursuers, he never could have made his way back to Kouka, the capital of Bornou.' 'Who was this Major Denham?' 'A fearless Englishman, who, between 1822 and 1824, commanded an expedition into the Bornou country, in company with Captain Clapperton and Dr. Oudney. They set out from Tripoli in the month of March, reached Mourzouk, the capital of Fez, and, following the route which at a later period Dr. Barth was to pursue on his way back to Europe, they arrived, on the 16th of February, 1823, at Kouka, near Lake Tchad. Denham made several explorations in Bornou, in Mandara, and to the eastern shores of the lake.' Eponymy The sub- Saharan bird Denham's bustard (Neotis denhami) is named for Denham.

Bennett's recent work at IBM has concentrated on a re- examination of the physical basis of information, applying quantum physics to the problems surrounding information exchange. He has played a major role in elucidating the interconnections between physics and information, particularly in the realm of quantum computation, but also in cellular automataCharles H. Bennett Bibliography. and reversible computing. He discovered, with Gilles Brassard, the concept of quantum cryptography and is one of the founding fathers of modern quantum information theory (see Bennett's four laws of quantum information). Early career Born in 1943 in New York City, Bennett earned a B.S. in Chemistry from Brandeis University in 1964 and received his PhD from Harvard in 1970 for molecular-dynamics studies (computer simulation of molecular motion) under David Turnbull and Berni Alder. At Harvard, he also worked for James Watson one year as a teaching assistant about the genetic code. For the next two years he continued this research under Aneesur Rahman at Argonne National Laboratory (operated by the University of Chicago). After joining IBM Research in 1972, he built on the work of IBM's Rolf Landauer to show that general-purpose computation can be performed by a logically and thermodynamically reversible apparatus; and in 1982 he proposed a re- interpretation of Maxwell's demon, attributing its inability to break the second law to the thermodynamic cost of destroying, rather than acquiring, information. He also published an important paper on the estimation of free- energy differences between two systems, the Bennett acceptance ratio method. Quantum cryptography In collaboration with Gilles Brassard of the Universit√© de Montr√©al he developed a system of quantum cryptography, known as BB84, which allows secure communication between parties who share no secret information initially, based on the uncertainty principle. With the help of John Smolin, he built the world's first working demonstration of quantum cryptography in 1989. His other research interests include algorithmic information theory, in which the concepts of information and randomness are developed in terms of the input/output relation of universal computers, and the analogous use of universal computers to define the intrinsic complexity or \\"logical depth\\" of a physical state as the time required by a universal computer to simulate the evolution of the state from a random initial state. Teleportation In 1993 Bennett and Brassard, in collaboration with others, discovered \\"quantum teleportation\\", an effect in which the complete information in an unknown quantum state is decomposed into purely classical information and purely non-classical Einstein‚ÄìPodolsky‚ÄìRosen (EPR paradox) correlations, sent through two separate channels, and later reassembled in a new location to produce an exact replica of the original quantum state that was destroyed in the sending process. Later work In 1995‚Äì1997, working with Smolin, Wootters, DiVincenzo, and other collaborators, he introduced several techniques for faithful transmission of classical and quantum information through noisy channels, part of the larger field of quantum information and computation theory. Together with others he also introduced the concept of entanglement distillation. Bennett is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the 2008 Harvey Prize by the TechnionLIST OF HARVEY PRIZE WINNERS and the 2006 Rank Prize in opto-electronics. In 2017 he received the Dirac Medal of the ICTP and in 2018 the Wolf Prize in Physics.Wolf Prize 2018 In June 2019, he received the Shannon Award and for 2019 the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Basic Sciences.BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award Bennett also co-runs a blog, The Quantum Pontiff, with Steve Flammia and Aram Harrow and hosted by Dave Bacon.

It occurs at Itacolumi, in the southern portion of Minas Gerais, Brazil. It is also found in Kaliana village (Charkhi Dadri district, Haryana, India); Georgia in the US; and Stokes and McDowell counties of North Carolina. It is the best and most widely known example of a flexible sandstone and is a source of diamonds found in the Minas Gerais area. On the split faces of the slabs, scales of greenish mica are visible, but in other respects, the rock seems to be remarkably pure. If a piece which is a foot or two long and half an inch thick is supported at its ends it will gradually bend by its own weight. If it is then turned over it will straighten and bend in the opposite direction. Flakes a millimetre or two thick can be bent between the fingers and are said to give out a creaking sound, but specimens showing this property form only a small part of the whole mass of the rock. Cause of flexibility Some discussion has taken place regarding the cause of the flexibility. At one time it was ascribed to the presence of thin scales of mica which were believed to permit a certain amount of motion between adjacent grains of quartz. More probably, however, it is due to the porous character of the rock together with the interlocking junctions between the sand grains. The porosity allows interstitial movement, while the hinge- like joints by which the particles are connected hold them together in spite of the displacement. These features are dependent to some extent on weathering, as the rocks contain perishable constituents which are removed and leave open cavities in their place, while at the same time additional silica may have been deposited on the quartz grains fitting their irregular surfaces more perfectly together. Most of the known flexible rocks are also fine- grained; in some cases, they are said to lose their flexibility after being dried for some time, probably because of the hardening of some interstitial substance, but many specimens kept in a dry atmosphere for years retain this property in a high degree.

It travels from I-75 in Stockbridge in the south to I-285 in the north. I-675 is also designated as the Terrell Starr Parkway and also has the unsigned internal state route designation of State Route 413 (SR 413). Route description Beginning at its southern terminus with Interstate 75, Interstate 675 is a four lane highway with a grassy median and frequently with cable barriers. Between Ellenwood Road/Forest Parkway and the route's northern terminus at Interstate 285 and Moreland Avenue, the freeway expands with three lanes in each direction. The southern end of Interstate 675 includes reversible High occupancy/toll and express toll lanes (ETLs) built within the median, the South Metro Express Lanes, which opened January 28, 2017. The entire length of I-675 is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. History At one time, I-675 was to connect with I-485/SR 400 east of downtown Atlanta. However, this would have destroyed many neighborhoods including Inman Park. Because it was thought that the road was unnecessary due to three other existing north‚Äìsouth Interstates across and around the city, and due to community opposition, the highway was stopped by then-governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter in 1975. After I-485 was cancelled, it was then planned to end at once proposed I-420 near Gresham Park. However, in 1986, I-420 was cancelled for the same reason. So, its northern terminus is at I-285 instead. What would have been the interchange between this road and I-485 is now the location of the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum. In 1982, the entire length of the highway was under construction. In 1987, it was open to traffic. Future As of 2010, the idea of connecting I-675 and SR 400 has been resurrected, being put on an official list of GDOT priorities. This would extend I-675 north to I-20 with a surface road, then go underground with a road tunnel. This would displace some neighborhoods and industrial areas to the south. The tunnel would protect other areas north of I-20, however there would still be ventilation buildings.

The freeway is a loop route through downtown Saginaw, as I-75 passes on the east side of the city. I-675 is also a state trunkline highway that provided a bypass of the former drawbridge carrying I-75 and US Highway 23 (US 23) across the Saginaw River. Construction of I-675 started in 1969 and the freeway opened in 1971. Since then, sections near downtown were reconstructed between 2009 and 2011 to update one of the freeway's interchanges and rebuild the bridge over the Saginaw River. Route description Splitting from I-75/US 23 on the eastern side of Saginaw, I-675 turns west toward downtown. The freeway runs between residential neighborhoods and has an interchange with Veterans Memorial Parkway. West of that interchange, it crosses a line of the Huron and Eastern Railway. From there, it runs on the northern edge of downtown near the Dow Event Center, spanning the Saginaw River on the Henry G. Marsh Bridge. On the west side of the river, the trunkline meets an interchange with M-58. From there it turns northward, crossing a line of the Mid-Michigan Railroad. I-675 continues northward, passing to the east of the Aleda E. Lutz VA Medical Center and through more residential neighborhoods in Saginaw Township North. After the interchange with Tittabawassee Road, which provides access to the Fashion Square Mall, I-675 turns northeasterly to connect back to I-75/US 23 north of the Zilwaukee Bridge. The entire length of the freeway has four lanes (two in each direction). alt=Photograph Like other state highways in Michigan, I-675 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2015, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 31,300 vehicles used the freeway daily across the river and 9,400 vehicles did so each day north of Tittabawassee Road, the highest and lowest counts along the trunkline, respectively. As an Interstate Highway, all of I-675 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History 1957 planning map for the Interstates in Saginaw I-675 was initially planned in the mid-1950s, and the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) originally proposed the number I-275 for the freeway through Saginaw in 1958, while the MSHD proposed an I-73 number for what is now I-275. The state started construction on I-675 in 1969. The freeway was to provide access to the downtown Saginaw area and serve as a bypass for the original Zilwaukee Bridge northeast of downtown, roles that continue today. At the time, the Zilwaukee Bridge was a bascule bridge that could be raised to allow shipping traffic to use the Saginaw River. Opening the drawbridge would back traffic up on the freeway for up to four hours on holiday weekends. I-675 helped relieve the congestion during such times. The record was a traffic jam on Labor Day 1968, although backups were common until the shipping companies using the Saginaw River limited their traffic in 1970. The freeway was completed in 1971 and opened to traffic that year. After completion, the state considered reconstructing I-675 to make the downtown freeway the through routing for I-75/US 23 in the Saginaw area to bypass the bascule bridge. Originally to be completed in 1983, the replacement bridge on I-75/US 23 finally opened on September 19, 1988. The next year, southbound I-675 was used to divert traffic around a temporary closure on the southbound span of the Zilwaukee Bridge. At the same time, northbound I-675 was closed while crews replaced the deck on the bridge over the Saginaw River. In 2002, the Zilwaukee Bridge was closed for a few months for joint repair work, and traffic was diverted onto I-675. The freeway through downtown was pressed back into service as a detour around the Zilwaukee Bridge for six months in 2008 as a mishap involving several steel reinforcement rods during a maintenance project closed that structure for an extended period of time. Then, starting in May 2009 and ending in November 2011, sections of I-675 were closed from exit 2 easterly to begin renovations during the summer construction seasons. These projects included rehabilitation of the Henry G. Marsh Bridge, the reconstruction of overpasses, and a redesigned exit at Warren Avenue to ease access into downtown Saginaw. The project cost $42 million (equivalent to $ in ).

The simplest of these circuits are a form of rectifier which take an AC voltage as input and outputs a doubled DC voltage. The switching elements are simple diodes and they are driven to switch state merely by the alternating voltage of the input. DC-to-DC voltage doublers cannot switch in this way and require a driving circuit to control the switching. They frequently also require a switching element that can be controlled directly, such as a transistor, rather than relying on the voltage across the switch as in the simple AC-to-DC case. Voltage doublers are a variety of voltage multiplier circuit. Many, but not all, voltage doubler circuits can be viewed as a single stage of a higher order multiplier: cascading identical stages together achieves a greater voltage multiplication. Voltage doubling rectifiersVillard circuit= Figure 1. Villard circuit The Villard circuit, conceived by Paul Ulrich Villard,. Villard's voltage booster appears in Fig. 1 on p. 31. consists simply of a capacitor and a diode. While it has the great benefit of simplicity, its output has very poor ripple characteristics. Essentially, the circuit is a diode clamp circuit. The capacitor is charged on the negative half cycles to the peak AC voltage (Vpk). The output is the superposition of the input AC waveform and the steady DC of the capacitor. The effect of the circuit is to shift the DC value of the waveform. The negative peaks of the AC waveform are \\"clamped\\" to 0 V (actually ‚àíVF, the small forward bias voltage of the diode) by the diode, therefore the positive peaks of the output waveform are 2Vpk. The peak-to-peak ripple is an enormous 2Vpk and cannot be smoothed unless the circuit is effectively turned into one of the more sophisticated forms. This is the circuit (with diode reversed) used to supply the negative high voltage for the magnetron in a microwave oven. =Greinacher circuit= Figure 2. Greinacher circuit The Greinacher voltage doubler is a significant improvement over the Villard circuit for a small cost in additional components. The ripple is much reduced, nominally zero under open-circuit load conditions, but when current is being drawn depends on the resistance of the load and the value of the capacitors used. The circuit works by following a Villard cell stage with what is in essence a peak detector or envelope detector stage. The peak detector cell has the effect of removing most of the ripple while preserving the peak voltage at the output. The Greinacher circuit is also commonly known as the half-wave voltage doubler.  Figure 3. Voltage quadrupler ‚Äì two Greinacher cells of opposite polarities This circuit was first invented by Heinrich Greinacher in 1913 (published 1914. Greinacher's voltage doubler appears in Fig. 4 on p. 412. He used chemical (electrolytic) rectifiers, which are denoted \\"Z\\" (Zellen, cells).) to provide the 200‚Äì300 V he needed for his newly invented ionometer, the 110 V AC supplied by the Zurich power stations of the time being insufficient.Mehra, p. 284 He later extended this idea into a cascade of multipliers in 1920.In 1919, a year before Greinacher published his voltage multiplier, the German Moritz Schenkel published a multi-stage voltage multiplier. * * A condensed version of Schenkel's article ‚Äî with an illustration of the circuit ‚Äî appeared in: \\"Eine neue Schaltung f√ºr die Erzeugung hoher Gleichspannungen,\\" Polytechnische Schau, 334 : 203-204 (1919). Available on-line at: Polytechnisches Journal. This cascade of Greinacher cells is often inaccurately referred to as a Villard cascade. It is also called a Cockcroft‚ÄìWalton multiplier after the particle accelerator machine built by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton, who independently discovered the circuit in 1932. The concept in this topology can be extended to a voltage quadrupler circuit by using two Greinacher cells of opposite polarities driven from the same AC source. The output is taken across the two individual outputs. As with a bridge circuit, it is impossible to simultaneously ground the input and output of this circuit. =Delon circuit= Figure 4. Bridge (Delon) voltage doubler The Delon circuit uses a bridge topology for voltage doubling;Jules Delon (1876-1941) was an engineer for the French company Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise des c√¢bles √©lectriques Berthoud- Borel. He used a mechanical rectifier, which was based on a rotating commutator (contact tournant). * His apparatus was exhibited at the 1908 Exposition d'√©lectricit√© in Marseille, France: Georges Tardy (August 15, 1908) \\"Contact tournant de la Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise des c√¢bles √©lectriques Systeme Berthoud-Borel\\", L'Electricien: Revue Internationale de l'Electricit√© et de ses Applications, 2nd series, 36 (920) : 97-98. (Article includes photograph of machine.) The equipment was used to test insulation on high-voltage commercial power lines. * The operation of Delon's bridge rectifier is also explained (with schematic) in: E. von Rziha and Josef Seidener, Starkstromtechnik: Taschenbuch f√ºr Elektrotechniker (High-current technology: A Pocket book for Electrical Engineers), 5th ed., vol. 1, (Berlin, Germany: Wilhelm Ernst & Sohn, 1921), pages 710-711. * Delon's name and dates appear in: Friedrich Heilbronner, Internationale Liste von Elektrotechnikern (2013), pp. 14-15. Brief obituary of Jules Delon, Technica (Journal of the Association des anciens eleves de l'ecole centrale Lyonnaise (Association of the Alumni of the Central School of Lyon)), 2nd series, no. 25, page 24 (December 1941). Available on-line at: Technica. See also Delon's U.S. patents no. 1,740,076, no. 1,837,952, and no. 1,995,201. consequently it is also called a full-wave voltage doubler. This form of circuit was, at one time, commonly found in cathode ray tube television sets where it was used to provide an Extra high tension (EHT) supply. Generating voltages in excess of 5 kV with a transformer has safety issues in terms of domestic equipment and in any case is uneconomical. However, black and white television sets required an e.h.t. of 10 kV and colour sets even more. Voltage doublers were used to either double the voltage on an e.h.t winding on the mains transformer or were applied to the waveform on the line flyback coils.Kories and Schmidt-Walter, p.615 Millman and Halkias, p. 109 Wharton and Howorth, pp. 68‚Äì69 The circuit consists of two half-wave peak detectors, functioning in exactly the same way as the peak detector cell in the Greinacher circuit. Each of the two peak detector cells operates on opposite half-cycles of the incoming waveform. Since their outputs are in series, the output is twice the peak input voltage. Switched capacitor circuits Figure 5. Switched capacitor voltage doubler achieved by simply switching charged capacitors from parallel to series It is possible to use the simple diode-capacitor circuits described above to double the voltage of a DC source by preceding the voltage doubler with a chopper circuit. In effect, this converts the DC to AC before application to the voltage doubler.McComb, pp.148-150 More efficient circuits can be built by driving the switching devices from an external clock so that both functions, the chopping and multiplying, are achieved simultaneously. Such circuits are known as switched capacitor circuits. This approach is especially useful in low-voltage battery- powered applications where integrated circuits require a voltage supply greater than the battery can deliver. Frequently, a clock signal is readily available on board the integrated circuit and little or no additional circuitry is needed to generate it. Conceptually, perhaps the simplest switched capacitor configuration is that shown schematically in figure 5. Here two capacitors are simultaneously charged to the same voltage in parallel. The supply is then switched off and the capacitors are switched into series. The output is taken from across the two capacitors in series resulting in an output double the supply voltage. There are many different switching devices that could be used in such a circuit, but in integrated circuits MOSFET devices are frequently employed.Ahmed, p.164 Figure 6. Charge-pump voltage doubler schematic Another basic concept is the charge pump, a version of which is shown schematically in figure 6. The charge pump capacitor, CP, is first charged to the input voltage. It is then switched to charging the output capacitor, CO, in series with the input voltage resulting in CO eventually being charged to twice the input voltage. It may take several cycles before the charge pump succeeds in fully charging CO but after steady state has been reached it is only necessary for CP to pump a small amount of charge equivalent to that being supplied to the load from CO. While CO is disconnected from the charge pump it partially discharges into the load resulting in ripple on the output voltage. This ripple is smaller for higher clock frequencies since the discharge time is shorter, and is also easier to filter. Alternatively, the capacitors can be made smaller for a given ripple specification. The practical maximum clock frequency in integrated circuits is typically in the hundreds of kilohertz.Zumbahlen, p.741 =Dickson charge pump= Figure 7. Dickson charge-pump voltage-doubler The Dickson charge pump, or Dickson multiplier, consists of a cascade of diode/capacitor cells with the bottom plate of each capacitor driven by a clock pulse train. The circuit is a modification of the Cockcroft-Walton multiplier but takes a DC input with the clock trains providing the switching signal instead of the AC input. The Dickson multiplier normally requires that alternate cells are driven from clock pulses of opposite phase. However, since a voltage doubler, shown in figure 7, requires only one stage of multiplication only one clock signal is required. Yuan, pp.13-14 The Dickson multiplier is frequently employed in integrated circuits where the supply voltage (from a battery for instance) is lower than that required by the circuitry. It is advantageous in integrated circuit manufacture that all the semiconductor components are of basically the same type. MOSFETs are commonly the standard logic block in many integrated circuits. For this reason the diodes are often replaced by this type of transistor, but wired to function as a diode - an arrangement called a diode- wired MOSFET. Figure 8 shows a Dickson voltage doubler using diode-wired n-channel enhancement type MOSFETs. Yuan, p.14 Figure 8. Dickson voltage doubler using diode-wired MOSFETs There are many variations and improvements to the basic Dickson charge pump. Many of these are concerned with reducing the effect of the transistor drain-source voltage. This can be very significant if the input voltage is small, such as a low-voltage battery. With ideal switching elements the output is an integral multiple of the input (two for a doubler) but with a single-cell battery as the input source and MOSFET switches the output will be far less than this value since much of the voltage will be dropped across the transistors. For a circuit using discrete components the Schottky diode would be a better choice of switching element for its extremely low voltage drop in the on state. However, integrated circuit designers prefer to use the easily available MOSFET and compensate for its inadequacies with increased circuit complexity. Yuan, 14-21 As an example, an alkaline battery cell has a nominal voltage of . A voltage doubler using ideal switching elements with zero voltage drop will output double this, namely . However, the drain-source voltage drop of a diode-wired MOSFET when it is in the on state must be at least the gate threshold voltage which might typically be .Liou et al., p.185 This voltage \\"doubler\\" will only succeed in raising the output voltage by about to . If the drop across the final smoothing transistor is also taken into account the circuit may not be able to increase the voltage at all without using multiple stages. A typical Schottky diode, on the other hand, might have an on state voltage of . A doubler using this Schottky diode will result in a voltage of , or at the output after the smoothing diode, .Yuan, p.17 =Cross-coupled switched capacitors= Figure 9. Cross-coupled switched-capacitor voltage doubler Cross-coupled switched capacitor circuits come into their own for very low input voltages. Wireless battery driven equipment such as pagers, bluetooth devices and the like may require a single-cell battery to continue to supply power when it has discharged to under a volt.Peluso et al., pp.36-37 When clock \\\\phi_1 \\\\ is low transistor Q2 is turned off. At the same time clock \\\\phi_2 \\\\ is high turning on transistor Q1 resulting in capacitor C1 being charged to Vin. When \\\\phi_1 \\\\ goes high the top plate of C1 is pushed up to twice Vin. At the same time switch S1 closes so this voltage appears at the output. At the same time Q2 is turned on allowing C2 to charge. On the next half cycle the roles will be reversed: \\\\phi_1 \\\\ will be low, \\\\phi_2 \\\\ will be high, S1 will open and S2 will close. Thus, the output is supplied with 2Vin alternately from each side of the circuit.Campardo et al., p.377 Peluso et al., p.36 The loss is low in this circuit because there are no diode-wired MOSFETs and their associated threshold voltage problems. The circuit also has the advantage that the ripple frequency is doubled because there are effectively two voltage doublers both supplying the output from out of phase clocks. The primary disadvantage of this circuit is that stray capacitances are much more significant than with the Dickson multiplier and account for the larger part of the losses in this circuit.Peluso et al., p.36 See also * Boost converter * Buck-boost converter * DC to DC converter * Flyback converter ReferencesBibliography *Ahmed, Syed Imran Pipelined ADC Design and Enhancement Techniques, Springer, 2010 . * *Campardo, Giovanni; Micheloni, Rino; Novosel, David VLSI-design of Non-volatile Memories, Springer, 2005 . * *Kories, Ralf; Schmidt-Walter, Heinz Taschenbuch der Elektrotechnik: Grundlagen und Elektronik, Deutsch Harri GmbH, 2004 . *Liou, Juin J.; Ortiz-Conde, Adelmo; Garc√≠a-S√°nchez, F.

It was first described by John Gould in 1841. Description Illustration by John Gould The eastern hare-wallaby was a small macropod, slightly larger and more slender than its surviving relative the rufous hare-wallaby. It had a body length of about 50 centimeters and a 33 centimeter long tail. Its fur colour varied from black through brown to yellow with a greyish-white belly. Distribution and habitat Specimen in Zoological Museum in St. Petersburg This species once inhabited the interior of New South Wales, Victoria and the Murray River region of South Australia. It was common in the level country between the Murray and Darling rivers, as well as the Liverpool Plains. Its preferred habitat consisted of open plains and grasslands. Ecology and behaviour Very little is known about this wallaby today. It was a strictly nocturnal animal which led a solitary lifestyle. During the day it sat still in a well-formed 'seat', usually in the shelter of a saltbush or a tussock. If approached too closely, it would bound off at great speed. One wallaby was chased by dogs for 500 metres and suddenly doubled back and came back within 6 metres of John Gould and leapt over his head; it could jump 1.8 metres high. Extinction The last known specimen of this species was a female collected in August 1889 in New South Wales. There were no further sightings of this species, even though researchers well into the 1930s were still uncertain of its extinction. The cause of its extinction remains uncertain, as it died out before intensive agriculture was introduced throughout its distribution and before the red fox became common in its habitat. Several causes of its extinction have been suggested, including trampling of its grassland habitat by cattle and sheep, changed burning regimes, or predation by introduced cats.

Interstate 675 serves as an eastern bypass of Dayton. I-675 measures in length. As originally proposed, the route was to reconnect with I-75 north of Dayton near Northridge rather than going east towards Springfield and I-70 (this was later rejected because part of the right-of-way would have gone through Wright-Patterson Air Force Base). Construction was completed in 1987, though some have lobbied to extend the highway west of Dayton. Route description From the south, the highway begins at a semi- directional T interchange with Interstate 75 in Miami Township, with four lanes. Next there is a modified split diamond interchange with State Route 725 in Washington Township; ramps to and from the south connect to SR 725, with an additional directional loop ramp from eastbound SR 725 to northbound ; ramps to and from the north connect to Yankee Street. Rather than employing a pair of one-way frontage roads typical for this type of interchange, access between SR 725 and Yankee Street is made via Leona Lane or via Yankee Street itself (both two-way streets). After this interchange, the highway opens to six lanes. The next junction is with SR 48 on the border of unincorporated Washington Township and the city of Centerville. First, there is a at West Alexandersville‚ÄìBellbrook (Alex‚ÄìBell) Road, providing a northbound exit and a southbound entrance. Next, there is a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 48\\\\. The loop ramp from northbound to SR 48 is directional northbound, and there is a directional ramp from southbound SR 48 to southbound ; thus the movements from northbound to southbound SR 48, and from northbound SR 48 to southbound , are made via Alex‚ÄìBell Road. The next major junction is with U.S. Route 35 in Beavercreek, which is a full-access cloverstack interchange; southbound traffic at this interchange uses collector/distributor lanes. The junction with North Fairfield Road and SR 844 provides access to Wright- Patterson Air Force Base Area A, Wright State University and the Wright State University Nutter Center. The configuration is a hybrid diamond interchange, with complete access provided to North Fairfield Road. There is partial direct access provided to SR 844: the exit ramp from northbound splits, with the right branch meeting North Fairfield Road, while the left branch becomes northbound SR 844 and flies under both and North Fairfield Road; the entrance ramp from North Fairfield Road to southbound is offset from its expected position in a diamond interchange, allowing southbound SR 844 to fly under North Fairfield Road and to merge on the entrance ramp's left. Access from southbound I-675 to northbound SR 844, and from southbound SR 844 to northbound I-675, is made indirectly, via North Fairfield Road and Colonel Glenn Highway. The interstate reduces to four lanes just after this interchange. The highway has a cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 70 near Fairborn, where it ends. The road continues as two-lane Spangler Road, which leads to the unincorporated community of Medway.

La Follette worked with the women's peace party during World War I. At the time of her death in 1931, The New York Times called her \\"probably the least known yet most influential of all American women who have had to do with public affairs in this country.\\" She is best remembered as the wife and helpmate of Robert \\"Fighting Bob\\" La Follette‚Äîa prominent Progressive Republican politician both in Wisconsin and on the national scene‚Äîand as co-editor with her husband of La Follette's Weekly Magazine. Biography Isabelle Case was born on April 21, 1859, in Summit, Juneau County, Wisconsin, and grew up on her family's farm in Baraboo. Her parents were Unitarians of English and Scottish descent. She attended the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison from 1875 to 1879 and, upon graduation, taught high school in Spring Green and junior high school in Baraboo. One of her students in Baraboo was John Ringling, of whom she later wrote \\"...when John read a long account -- interrupted with giggles from the school -- of the side shows he and other boys had been giving every night, I lectured him and drew the moral that if John would put his mind on his lessons as he did on side shows, he might yet become a scholar. Fortunately the scolding had no effect.\\" = Education= In 1875, Belle Case left home for the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with the financial support of her farming parents. She excelled as a student, never missing a class or arriving late while at the university. Even early in life, Belle did not shy away from protesting what she perceived as injustices, particularly those targeted at women. In regard to one of her speeches, local paper Madison Democrat wrote, \\"...she portrayed the vanity of many of us in trying to make an empty display and neglecting it for true stability and depth of sentiment.\\" In another speech, \\"Children's Playthings,\\" Belle conflated the convention of young girls playing with dolls with future expectations for womanhood, claiming these domestic \\"dreams\\" of girlhood would only lead to \\"impossible future happiness\\" and \\"dissatisfied, nervous, complaining [women].\\" Her senior oration is perhaps her most memorable. \\"Learning to See\\" highlighted natural curiosity and the danger of forcing children to conform to convention. It won her the Lewis Prize for best essay or oration produced by the graduating class. Belle Case La Follette later returned to the University of Wisconsin and in 1885 became the University of Wisconsin Law School's first female graduate. =Marriage= Belle Case La Follette with her elder son, Robert Jr., in 1908. Belle Case and Bob La Follette developed an early friendship at University of Wisconsin, their love of reform and rural backgrounds providing common ground for a potential courtship. Belle, however, only wished their bond to remain \\"free from sentiment,\\" at least until they had left college. While Belle excelled in her studies, Bob became notorious for poor grades but a clear, charismatic intelligence. While Bob helped Belle in her own speech- giving, Belle assisted Bob in his school work and other written projects (Bob would later only barely graduate, John Bascom himself having to provide the final say-so.) Their companionship eventually did blossom into an engagement. Bob would later say that, \\"Mamma laughed when I proposed to her.\\" Case and La Follette were married on December 31, 1881, in a ceremony performed by a Unitarian minister. By mutual agreement, the word \\"obey\\" was omitted from their marriage vows. While Bob respected Belle's independence, intelligence, and beliefs, he still hoped for a domestic life, writing in his journal, \\"Oh hasten [the] time when I can see her the center of a home.\\"Robert Marion La Follette, diary, entry for November 17, 1879. Belle remained an activist throughout her life, but did note that \\"the supreme experience in life is motherhood,\\" and enjoyed taking care of their children. Belle and Robert La Follette were the parents of four children (two daughters and two sons).Unger, \\"Belle La Follette's Fight for Women's Suffrage,\\" pp. 36‚Äì37. Their first child, Flora Dodge La Follette, always called \\"Fola,\\" was born on September 10, 1882. Fola married the playwright George Middleton on October 29, 1911. Robert Jr., born in 1895, represented Wisconsin in the U.S. Senate from 1925 to 1947; Philip, born in 1897, served three terms as governor of Wisconsin; and Mary, born in 1899. Robert Jr. and Philip began the Wisconsin Progressive Party, which briefly held a dominant role in Wisconsin politics. =Early career= Belle's first job upon graduating was as an assistant principal at Spring Green High School. During this time she didn't spend much time with her then fianc√©, Bob, often to his chagrin. But Bob was equally busy serving as the new Dane County district attorney; so much so that he had to \\"remind\\" himself to attend their marriage ceremony. After the birth of their first child, Belle enjoyed motherhood but was also determined to retain a professional life. In 1885 she became the first woman to graduate from University of Wisconsin Law School. She never practiced law formally, but would assist her husband Bob in numerous cases and later political queries. Belle's role was anything but passive, even behind the scenes. In the 1890s, she penned a brief that broke new legal ground and won a case before the state's Supreme Court. Bob would later remark in his autobiography that she was his \\"wisest and best counselor,\\" > This is not partial judgement, the Progressive leaders of Wisconsin who > welcomed her to our conferences would bear witness. Her grasp of the great > problems, sociological and economic, is surpassed by any of the strong men > who have been associated with me in my work. = Activism = Belle Case La Follette (left) reading with her family in February 1924. La Follette was active in the women's suffrage movement at the state and national levels. Beginning in 1909, to express her views on women‚Äôs suffrage and other topics of the day, she wrote and edited a weekly \\"Home and Education\\" column for La Follette's Weekly Magazine, a magazine started by her husband and later became The Progressive.Unger, \\"Belle La Follette's Fight for Women's Suffrage,\\" p. 31. In 1911 and 1912 she wrote a syndicated column for the North American Press Syndicate. La Follette's interest in women's suffrage lead to her membership in the National American Woman Suffrage Association in 1910, and joined its national board in 1911. However, when a referendum on women‚Äôs suffrage in Wisconsin was to be decided in a general election in November 1912, she resigned from the NAWSA to devote her efforts to secure its passage.Unger, \\"Belle La Follette's Fight for Women's Suffrage,\\" pp. 33‚Äì35. Suffragists made appearances at more than 70 county fairs in 1912, including La Follette, who visited seven of them in ten days. Despite their efforts, the referendum was defeated by a vote of 227,024 to 135,546. When subsequent referendums to gain voting rights for women in Wisconsin were defeated in 1913 and 1915, La Follette, like other suffragists at that time, decided to devote her efforts to a national campaign for a women's suffrage amendment to the U.S. Constitution. On April 26, 1913, La Follette was among the members of the public who spoke before the U.S. Senate Committee on Women's Suffrage, delivering what the National Magazine described as \\"a remarkable and forcible address\\" at the gathering.Unger, \\"Belle La Follette's Fight for Women's Suffrage,\\" pp. 36‚Äì37. She was also among the ninety-four suffragists who met with President Woodrow Wilson in the White House during the early days of his administration. Determined to gather public support for the constitutional amendment on women's suffrage, La Follette joined the lecture circuit to address audiences in the Midwest. In addition, she gave numerous speeches in her home state in 1919 to assure that Wisconsin voters would support ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment.Unger, pp. \\"Belle La Follette's Fight for Women's Suffrage,\\" p. 37‚Äì38. La Follette also opposed the ongoing oppression of African Americans.Unger, p. \\"Belle La Follette's Fight for Women's Suffrage,\\" p. 36. In 1914 she addressed the colored Young Men's Christian Association, raising an argument that segregation of colored people on street cars, public conveyances, and government departments was wrong. La Follette added that there would be no constitution of peace until the question is \\"settled right\\". In 1915 La Follette helped found the Woman's Peace Party, which later became the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. After World War I, she was active in the Women's Committee for World Disarmament, and helped found the National Council for the Prevention of War in 1921. La Follette and other women influenced governments to convene the Naval Arms Limitation Conference in 1922. After her husband's death on June 18, 1925, his seat in the U.S. Senate was offered to her, but she turned down the opportunity to become the first woman Senator, perhaps because it would have upset the very balance between her public and private lives that she is esteemed for. =Death= She died on August 18, 1931 in Washington D.C., as the result of a punctured intestine and peritonitis following a routine medical exam. She was buried in Forest Hill Cemetery in Madison. Published works * References External Links  * Constitutional Minutes; Belle LaFollette: Womens Suffrage; 102.

Biography He was born at Vegesack, now part of Bremen. He was the son of a physician, and there was much pressure on Rohlfs to be in the field of medicine. After the ordinary course at the gymnasium of Osnabr√ºck, he entered the Bremen corps in 1848, and took part as a volunteer in the Schleswig-Holstein campaign, being made an officer after the battle of Idstedt (July 1850). He then became a medical student, and studied at the universities of Heidelberg, W√ºrzburg, and G√∂ttingen. He wanted to travel, joined the French Foreign Legion in a medical capacity, and served during the conquest of Kabylia. He attained the highest rank open to a foreigner, and was decorated for bravery as Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. Having learned the Arabic language and the mode of life of the inhabitants, in 1861 he went to Morocco, and was for some time personal physician to a nobleman there. He then set off on his own, exploring the oases of Morocco. It was on this trip that he was attacked and left for dead, his leg almost severed from his body. These injuries would keep him from returning to Europe for most of his life, the cold weather somehow aggravating them. In 1864 he continued his travels in Morocco, and crossed the Atlas Mountains to the oasis of Tuat. His description and map of the country were the first ever made from personal observation and with scientific knowledge. After this trip, and a short visit to Germany, Rohlfs returned to Africa, and, disguised as an Arab (going so far as to have himself circumcised)Hochschild, Adam. King Leopold's Ghost. New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1999. p. 43., was the first European to cross Africa from Tripoli across the Sahara desert via Lake Chad and along the Niger River and to present-day Lagos on the Gulf of Guinea from 1865-1867. He was the second European explorer to visit the region of the Draa River in the south of Morocco. For this work, in 1868 he was awarded the Patron's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society of London. Rohlfs's detailed account of it is contained in the Erg√§nzungsheft (‚ÄúSupplement‚Äù) No. 34 to Petermann's Geographische Mittheilungen (Gotha, 1872). At the close of 1867, by order of the king of Prussia, he joined the British punitive expedition to Abyssinia. He returned to Tripoli in 1868, and in 1869 traversed the desert from Tripoli to Alexandria, visiting the oasis of Siwah, site of the ancient city of Ammonium. Returning to Germany, he married and settled down in Weimar. Rohlfs posing with a scimitar In 1873, with an expedition of 100 camels and 90 men, organized under the patronage of the khedive of Egypt Isma'il Pasha, he explored the Libyan desert west of the chain of oases which skirt the valley of the Nile, and discovered that the depression called the Bahr Bela-ma (river without water), marked on many maps of the desert at that time, did not exist. In 1874 Rohlfs set out from Dakhla Oasis intending to reach Kufra. In February he was about north of Abu Ballas (Pottery Hill) in the Western Desert. Accompanied by Karl Zittel and a surveyor called Jordans, Rohlfs and his colleagues experienced a torrential downpour - a rare occurrence in the desert. Rohlf's team restocked and watered their camels and left a cairn at the place he had named Regenfeld (‚ÄúRain field‚Äù).W.B. Kennedy Shaw, Long Range Desert Group, Greenhill Books, 2000 The progress of the expedition was stopped by hills of loose sliding sand which the camels were unable to traverse, and the party turned back. In 1875, he visited the United States, and lectured on his travels. In 1878 Rohlfs and Anton Stecker (1855-1888) were commissioned by the German African Society to go to Wadai. They succeeded in reaching the oasis of Kufra, one of the chief centres of the Senussites, but being attacked by Arabs, they were obliged to retreat, making their way to the coast at Benghazi, reached in October 1879. In 1880 Rohlfs accompanied Stecker in an exploring expedition to Abyssinia; but after delivering a letter from the German emperor to the Negus, he returned to Europe. In 1885, when the rivalry between the British and Germans in East Africa was very keen, Otto von Bismarck appointed Rohlfs consul at Zanzibar, which island Bismarck desired to secure for Germany. Rohlfs, untrained in diplomacy, was no match for John Kirk, the British agent, and he was soon recalled, and did not again visit Africa. Rohlfs died at R√ºngsdorf, near Bonn.

In a career spanning six decades, Howard wrote many popular and enduring songs, recorded by a variety of different artists. Career Howard was born on September 8, 1927, in Detroit, Michigan, and grew up on a farm in Michigan. As a child, he listened to the Grand Ole Opry radio show. In later years, Howard recalled the personal formative influence of country music: > I was captured by the songs as much as the singer. They grabbed my heart. > The reality of country music moved me. Even when I was a kid, I liked the > sad songs‚Ä¶ songs that talked about true life. I recognized this music as a > simple plea. It beckoned me.Harlan Howard, Paul Wadey (2002-03-05). The > Independent (London). Retrieved 2019-03-09. Howard completed only nine years of formal education, though he was an avid reader.‚ÄòHarlan Howard‚Äô , Harlan Howard web-site. When he was 12 years of age, he began writing songs, \\"an enthusiasm fueled by an appetite for books and an ear for a telling phrase.\\" After serving as a paratrooper with the United States Army, he went to Los Angeles, California, hoping to sell his music. Howard did manual labor while writing songs and pushing his finished material. Eventually, he sold some of his compositions and, after a few minor successes, his song, \\"Pick Me Up on Your Way Down\\", recorded by Charlie Walker, went to No. 2 on the country music charts in late 1958. A year later Ray Price had a major country hit with \\"Heartaches By The Number\\". Simultaneously, a pop version of the song performed by Guy Mitchell went to No. 1 on the pop chart. Buoyed by these two major hits, Howard moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1960. Bringing along a large portfolio of compositions, he signed a contract with Acuff-Rose Music. Howard's songs were so immediately successful that, in 1961 alone, he had fifteen of his compositions on the country music charts, earning him ten BMI awards. Among his biggest hits was \\"I Fall to Pieces\\", co-written with Hank Cochran and recorded by Patsy Cline. Cline and Candi Staton recorded his \\"He Called Me Baby\\", which was later a No. 1 C&W; hit for Charlie Rich as \\"She Called Me Baby\\". Though not often thought of as a writer of rhythm and blues songs, Howard wrote Joe Simon's No. 1 R&B; chart hit \\"The Chokin' Kind\\", a million-selling record in 1969. Howard also wrote the classic Kingston Trio song \\"Everglades\\", and the song \\"Busted\\", originally a hit for both Ray Charles and Johnny Cash and later a hit for John Conlee who used the song to create awareness for Feed the Children. The song \\"The Wall\\", also became a hit for Johnny Cash on his studio album, Orange Blossom Special, as well as his Live at Folsom Prison album. Howard coined the oft-quoted phrase defining a great country song: \\"Three chords and the truth.\\"‚ÄòCountry Scribe Harlan Howard Dies‚Äô, obituary in Rolling Stone magazine Howard was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1973, the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1997, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame also in 1997.

The museum is in the former Bront√´ family home, the parsonage in Haworth, West Yorkshire, England, where the sisters spent most of their lives and wrote their famous novels. The Bront√´ Society, one of the oldest literary societies in the English speaking world, is a registered charity. Its members support the preservation of the museum and library collections. The parsonage is listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England. Background The parsonage was built between 1778 and 1779. In 1820, Patrick Bront√´ was appointed incumbent of St Michael and All Angels' Church, Haworth, and arrived at the parsonage with his wife Maria and six children. It was the family home for the rest of their lives, and its moorland setting had a profound influence on the writing of Charlotte, Emily Jane and Anne. Patrick Bront√´ was a published author of poetry and fiction and his children grew up accustomed to the sight of books carrying their family name on the parsonage shelves. St Michael and All Angel's Church, Haworth On 15 September 1821, Maria Bront√´ died of cancer, and her unmarried sister, Elizabeth Branwell, came to run the household, exchanging her home in Penzance for the harsh climate of a bleak northern township. In 1824 the four oldest sisters left Haworth, to attend the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge, near Kirkby Lonsdale. The eldest daughter, Maria, was sent home ill and died at the parsonage in May 1825, aged eleven. Ten-year-old Elizabeth was returned home shortly after and died on 15 June. In 1846 Charlotte, Emily and Anne used part of their Aunt Branwell's legacy to finance the publication of their poems, concealing their true identities under the pseudonyms Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. Poems was published by Aylott and Jones, but only two copies were sold. Charlotte's first attempt at writing a novel for publication, The Professor, was rejected by several publishing houses, before Smith, Elder & Co. declined to accept it but were encouraging enough for Charlotte to send them her next work, Jane Eyre. It was accepted and published on 19 October 1847. Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey had been accepted by the London publisher, Thomas Cautley Newby and appeared as a three-volume set in December 1847. After Anne's second novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Charlotte and Anne were forced to reveal their true identities. Their brother, Branwell, who had become dependent on alcohol and opium for solace, had developed tuberculosis and died suddenly on Sunday 24 September 1848, aged 31. Emily was also dying from the disease, and never left the house after Branwell's funeral. She died aged 30 on 19 December 1848. Anne too had tuberculosis and was taken to Scarborough to try a sea cure but died four days after arriving on 28 May 1849, aged 29 years (Anne's gravestone mistakenly marks her age as 28 when she died). Charlotte finished the novel Shirley, begun before Branwell's death. It was published in October 1849. Her last novel, Villette, was published in 1853. She married her father's curate Arthur Bell Nicholls in Haworth Church on 29 June 1854. She died on 31 March 1855, in the early stages of pregnancy, three weeks before her 39th birthday. Patrick Bront√´ lived at the parsonage for six more years, cared for by his son-in-law, and died there on 7 June 1861, at the age of 84. Bront√´ Society After Patrick Bront√´'s death in 1861 the contents of the parsonage were auctioned. Friends and servants sold keepsakes and letters. In 1893 the chief librarian of Bradford Library held a meeting suggesting that relics, letters and documents relating to the Bront√´s should be collected and preserved for posterity. The Bront√´ Society was founded at a public meeting and a collection of Bront√´ana was started. By 1895 it was large enough to be displayed in a museum above the Yorkshire Penny Bank in Haworth. The society attracted 260 members, and about 10,000 visitors visited the museum in its first year. Sir James Roberts bought Haworth Parsonage in 1928 for ¬£3,000. He equipped it as a museum and gave it to the Bront√´ Society. Henry Bonnell of Philadelphia bequeathed his collection to the society in 1926 and it was transferred to the parsonage when it opened, making it accessible to Bront√´ scholars. The collection has grown and been supplemented by loan materials. The society has about 2,000 members. The mahogany desk at which Charlotte wrote her novels, which had been in private collections for more than a century, was donated to the museum in 2011 by a donor who purchased it anonymously for ¬£20,000 in 2009. In popular culture The parsonage was used as a location in the 1970 film The Railway Children, where it featured as the home of Dr Forrest. The opening of the museum in 1928 is central to Frances Brody's 2018 novel A Snapshot of Murder (Piatkus, ).

Neulovimye mstiteli) is a 1967 Soviet adventure film directed by Edmond Keosayan and made by Mosfilm. It is loosely based on the novel Red Devilets by Pavel Blyakhin,English DVD cover. already filmed in 1923 under its original name. The film is an example of Ostern, set in Russian Civil War era Ukraine. The film has spawned two sequels, The New Adventures of the Elusive Avengers (1968) and The Crown of the Russian Empire, or Once Again the Elusive Avengers (1971). Synopsis The film is a version of a story about four youngsters who become heroes in the Russian Civil War. Danka, orphaned son of a Red agent, whose father was tortured and executed by the warlord Lyuty before his eyes, and his sister Ksanka join Valerka, a former schoolboy, and Yashka, a devil-may-care gypsy. They make a pledge of mutual assistance, determined to exact revenge on the bandits who are bringing so much suffering to peaceful villagers. The friends then embark on a series of daring adventures. Meanwhile, strange things begin to happen to a band of outlaws led by the ruthless bandit Ataman Burnash. All his schemes seem to go wrong, sabotaged by unseen and unidentified enemies. The mischievous culprits always leave a note signed '- the Elusive Avengers', and are of course the four friends, who succeed by never forgetting their pledge of mutual assistance. They are so effective, in fact, that reports of their deeds are reaching the local division of the Red Army. In a plot twist familiar to many Westerns such as For a Few Dollars More and the Japanese Yojimbo, Danka uses his anonymity to infiltrate the outlaws' gang and insinuate himself into Burnash's confidence, becoming his trusted right hand man. Unfortunately, Warlord Lyuty, whom Danka had thought he killed earlier, arrives at the Ataman's camp and accuses Danka; and when Lyuty's accusations are proven, it is up to the other three Avengers to get him out. At the end of the movie, the Avengers are honored and acknowledged by the Red Army, which promptly appropriates the four of them as soldiers. The Elusive Avengers ride off into the rising sun, ready to answer their army's call.

The 1923 adaptation replaced him with a black boy, Tom Jackson, a move very popular in early Soviet cinema to display Soviet internationalism (compare Circus or Flight to the Moon). The Elusive Avengers, filmed in Cold War era, by contrast, avoided references to the United States and replaced the obviously propagandistic black Tom with the more realistic gypsy Yashka.

It was formerly considered a member of the genus Gazella within the subgenus Eudorcas before Eudorcas was promoted to a full genus. It was thought to have lived in the better-watered mountain areas of North Africa rather than in deserts, because of the rich colouring on the coat. There are no records of the red gazelle in the wild. It is known from three specimens purchased in markets in Algiers and Oran, northern Algeria, in the late 19th century. They are held in museums in Paris and London. Some authorities, such as Jonathan Kingdon, consider it a subspecies of the red-fronted gazelle (E. rufifrons or G. rufifrons). In 2008, K. de Smet reported one of the three specimens had proved on examination to be E. rufifrons, leading the IUCN Red List to revise its assessment of the species from Extinct to Data Deficient on the basis of doubts as to the validity of the taxon. Physical characteristics The red gazelle is described as larger than the red-fronted gazelle, with heavier hooves, and distinctive bright red-brown fur. It is characterized to have thin (2.5‚Äì4 cm wide) black stripes across its flanks, in between its rear and front legs. The top of the head, cheeks, and sides of the neck are a pale whitish color, while the undersides and rump are a plain white colour.

He was an editor of Nature for 22 years, from 1966 to 1973 and 1980 to 1995.John Maddox interview (1997) Education and early life John Royden Maddox was born on 27 November 1925, at Penllergaer near Swansea, Wales. He was the son of Arthur Jack Maddox, a furnaceman at an aluminium plant. He was educated at Gowerton Boys' County School. From there, aged 15, he won a state scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, where he read chemistry, and King's College London, where he studied physics. Career From 1949 to 1955 Maddox lectured in theoretical physics at the University of Manchester. He then became the science correspondent at The Manchester Guardian, a post he held until 1964. From 1964 to 1966 he was the coordinator of the Nuffield Science Teaching Project; after which he was appointed editor of Nature, a role he held from 1966 to 1973 (and 1980 to 1995). He was director of the Nuffield Foundation from 1975 to 1979. From 1980 to 1995 he was again editor of Nature. In 1990, he publicly investigated homoeopathy claims. =Sheldrake editorial, 1981= When the book A New Science of Life by British biologist Rupert Sheldrake was published in 1981, proposing the theory of morphic resonance instead of DNA as the basis for shapes and behaviour in nature, Maddox denounced it fiercely in an editorial titled \\"A book for burning?\\" in which he argued that Sheldrake's ideas were pseudoscience. Maddox concluded that the book should not be burned but placed \\"among the literature of intellectual aberrations\\". He elaborated in a 1994 BBC documentary on Sheldrake's theory: =Stance on AIDS denial= Maddox is remembered for his opposition to the notion that AIDS is not caused by the HIV virus. As editor of Nature, in 1993 Maddox decided not to publish the words of Peter Duesberg, who had claimed AIDS was caused by drugs, because in Maddox's view the stakes were too high for such a prestigious journal to disseminate discredited views. =Big Bang denial= In the late 1980s, as evidence for the Big Bang origin of the Universe accumulated, Maddox, who favoured the Steady State theory, penned an editorial denouncing the theory as \\"philosophically unacceptable\\" (because he saw it giving a foothold to Creationists) and \\"over-simplistic\\" and he predicted its demise within a decade (when results from the Hubble Space Telescope would become available). =Publications= Maddox authored and edited numerous publications including: * Beyond the Energy Crisis * Revolution in Biology * The Doomsday Syndrome * What Remains to Be Discovered: Mapping the Secrets of the Universe, the Origins of Life, and the Future of the Human Race.What remains to be discovered (hardcover, 1998), (paperback, 1999) Honours and awards In 1995 Maddox was knighted. In 2000 he was made an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society. His nomination read: The John Maddox Prize is named in his honour. The prize is awarded to people who have stood up for science, despite facing difficulty and opposition. He was a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association, and a trustee of Sense About Science. In 1994 the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSICOP) presented Maddox the Public Education in Science Award. In April 2011, the executive council of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI, formerly CSICOP) selected Maddox for inclusion in CSI's Pantheon of Skeptics. The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism. Personal life Maddox lived in London, and spent time at his cottage near Brecon in Wales, where he and his wife, Brenda Maddox, were involved in the local community. They had two children, Bronwen and Bruno Maddox. He had two previous children with Nancy Fanning (Piers Maddox and Joanna Maddox), and two children with Lois Barton (Lois Wheatley and Adrian Maddox).

Cathodes are thin sheets of pure lead and anodes are cast from the impure lead to be purified. A potential of 0.5 volts is applied. At the anode, lead dissolves, as do metal impurities that are less noble than lead. Impurities that are more noble than lead, such as silver, gold, and bismuth, flake from the anode as it dissolves and settle to the bottom of the vessel as \\"anode mud.\\" Pure metallic lead plates onto the cathode, with the less noble metals remaining in solution.

It weighed 80 grams. The last record is from June 1896. Only two complete specimens were collected, probably from Aborigines. It was among the largest of all Australian hopping mice recorded in Australia; it was twice as heavy as any living species of hopping mice, although fossils suggest the extinct great hopping mouse may have been a similar size. The short-tailed hopping mouse was predominantly brown in colour, its tail probably being as long as its body. This species' decline was due to a number of factors, some of which were being hunted by predators such as foxes, cats and habitat alterations.

Biography  Born in London in 1925, Sutton relocated to California in 1957 and became a U.S. citizen in 1962. He studied at the universities of London, G√∂ttingen, and California and received his D.Sc. from the University of Southampton. Sutton then received an economics professorship at California State University, Los Angeles and a research fellowship at Stanford University's Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace from 1968 to 1973. During his time at the Hoover Institution, he wrote the major study Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development (in three volumes), arguing that the West played a major role in developing the Soviet Union from its very beginnings up until the then-present year of 1970. Sutton argued that the Soviet Union's technological and manufacturing base, which was then engaged in supplying the Viet Cong, was built by United States corporations and largely funded by US taxpayers. Steel and iron plants, the GAZ automobile factory, a Ford subsidiary in eastern Russia, and many other Soviet industrial enterprises were built with the help or technical assistance of the United States or US corporations. He argued further that the Soviet Union's acquisition of MIRV technology was made possible by receiving (from US sources) machining equipment for the manufacture of precision ball bearings, necessary to mass-produce MIRV-enabled missiles. He contributed articles to Human Events, The Review of the News, Triumph, Ordnance, and many other journals. In 1973, Sutton published a popularized, condensed version of the sections of the forthcoming third volume relevant to military technology called National Suicide: Military Aid to the Soviet Union after which he was forced out of the Hoover Institution. His conclusion from his research on the issue was that the conflicts of the Cold War were \\"not fought to restrain communism\\" but were organised in order \\"to generate multibillion-dollar armaments contracts\\", since the United States, through financing the Soviet Union \\"directly or indirectly armed both sides in at least Korea and Vietnam.\\"Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler, Chapter 12 The update to the text, The Best Enemy Money Can Buy, looked at the role of military technology transfers up to the 1980s. Appendix B of that text contained the text of his 1972 testimony before Subcommittee VII of the Platform Committee of the Republican Party in which he summarized the essential aspects of his overall research: Sutton's next three published books (Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution, Wall Street and FDR and Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler) detailed Wall Street's involvement in the Bolshevik Revolution to destroy Russia as an economic competitor and turn it into \\"a captive market and a technical colony to be exploited by a few high-powered American financiers and the corporations under their control\\"Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution, Chapter XI as well as its decisive contributions to the rise of Adolf Hitler and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose policies he assessed as being essentially the same \\"corporate socialism,\\" planned by the big corporations.Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler, Chapter 8 Sutton concluded that it was all part of the economic power elites' \\"long-range program of nurturing collectivism\\" and fostering \\"corporate socialism\\" in order to ensure \\"monopoly acquisition of wealth\\" because it \\"would fade away if it were exposed to the activity of a free market.\\"Wall Street and FDR, Chapter 12. In his view, the only solution to prevent such abuse in the future was that \\"a majority of individuals declares or acts as if it wants nothing from government, declares it will look after its own welfare and interests\\" or, specifically, if \\"a majority finds the moral courage and the internal fortitude to reject the something-for-nothing con game and replace it by voluntary associations, voluntary communes, or local rule and decentralized societies.\\" In the early 1980s, Sutton used a combination of public-domain information on Skull and Bones (such as Yale yearbooks) and previously unreleased documents sent to him by Charlotte Thomson Iserbyt whose father was a Skull and Bones member to write America's Secret Establishment: An Introduction to the Order of Skull and Bones, which, according to Sutton, was his most important work. The description on the back flap of the dust jacket of Sutton's 1976 book by '76 Press, Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler, reveals that Sutton was then working on a forthcoming two-part study of the Federal Reserve System and the War on Gold to be published by '76 Press in 1977. When The War on Gold was released the following year in 1977, the dust jacket description announced the follow-up book, The Paper Factory, would be published in 1978, but this book was never released. Archive footage of Sutton was used in the 2014 documentary, JFK to 9/11: Everything Is a Rich Man's Trick. The Hoover Institution Archives house four boxes of Sutton‚Äôs personal papers from 1920 to 1972. The collection includes writings, clippings, letters, and notes related to the outbreak of wars, civil wars, revolutions and other violent conflicts around the globe from 1820 to 1970. There is a particular emphasis on the life and career of American entrepreneur Armand Hammer, especially as relates to his business investments in the Soviet Union.  Criticism  Sutton's works have received a number of criticisms from other academics, particularly in regards to his Wall Street trilogy (Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution, Wall Street and FDR, and Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler)\\". Some historians argue that these books more closely resemble conspiracy theory than genuine historical studies. For instance, in a contemporary review of Sutton's Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution, researcher Virgil D. Medlin of Oklahoma City University reported finding numerous factual errors in the book and claimed that Sutton repeated \\"unsubstantiated allegations [and came to] unwarranted conclusions.\\" Medlin also stated Sutton made use of dubious sources, such as rumor and uncorroborated inquiries, as \\"documentary proof of [his] allegations.\\" Similarly, Howard Dickman of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research referred to Sutton's Wall Street and FDR as a \\"weak specimen of conspiracy history\\" that was \\"poorly written and edited, digressive, repetitious, disorganized, and unconvincing.\\" Sutton's Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development, 1945 to 1965 has also received criticism, specifically in regards to its thesis. Dr. Samuel Lieberstein of Temple University had initially praised the first two volumes of the study but later came to criticize it in his review of the third volume, stating that Sutton failed to note instances of Soviet technological innovation and ignored positive aspects of the USSR's planned economy that seemed to conflict with his thesis. British historian Richard C. Thurlow also criticized Sutton's thesis stating that ‚Äúall nations were dependent on international trade for economic development and their industrial infrastructure, including the United States‚Äù adding that Sutton \\"totally [disregarded] alternative explanations of Soviet industrialization\\".

The name \\"Goolwa\\" means \\"elbow\\" in Ngarrindjeri, the local Aboriginal language, and the area was known as \\"The Elbow\\" to the early settlers. Goolwa is approximately 100 km south of Adelaide, and is the seat of the Alexandrina Council. It is in the state electoral district of Hammond and the federal Division of Mayo. At the 2011 census, the state suburb of Goolwa (excluding Goolwa Beach, Goolwa North and Goolwa South) had a population of 2,201. At June 2018, the estimated urban population for Goolwa together with nearby Victor Harbor was 26,532, Estimated resident population, 30 June 2018. having increased at an average annual rate of 1.07% year-on-year over the preceding five years. The portion of this combined urban area residing in Goolwa is 11,578.  History  Before 1837 the area was briefly considered for the site of the colony's capital; a 'special survey' was undertaken in 1839‚Äì40 with a sizeable township laid out at Currency Creek and land for a port with substantial warehousing on the river where Goolwa now stands. A wharf was constructed in 1852 and government buildings soon followed, including a post office in 1853.Cox, Philip & Stacey, Wesley (1973) Historic towns of Australia, Melbourne, Lansdowne, p.184. However, the treacherous waters of the Murray Mouth made it difficult for shipping and made the town unsuitable as a major port. Goolwa neverthelees developed as Australia's first inland port (1853) built to connect the town to Port Elliot and later extended to Victor Harbor, allowing goods to move from river boats to sea boats, so that neither had to negotiate the Murray Mouth. The spread of railways to inland Australia put an end to the river trade and Goolwa's significance as a port. With the decline of the river trade Goolwa became dependent on local farming and fishing, as well as becoming a popular destination for holidaymakers from Adelaide.The Goolwa to Port Elliot Railway Callaghan, W.H. Australian Railway History, May, 2004 pp 163‚Äì181 In 1935 a permanent barrage (called the Goolwa Barrage) was constructed between Hindmarsh Island and Sir Richard Peninsula on the south eastern outskirts of Goolwa. The barrage separates the fresh water of the River Murray from the salt water coming up from the River Murray mouth. The barrage was constructed to prevent the salt water traversing further up the River Murray and polluting much needed fresh water. Goolwa had earlier been connected to Hindmarsh Island by a cable ferry; this was replaced in 2001 by the official opening of the Hindmarsh Island bridge, the construction of which had been a focus of national controversy during the 1990s. During 2008 and 2009 Goolwa suffered from one of the worst droughts in Australian history and the river which has sustained the town throughout its history was reduced to nothing much more than a channel and mudflats. The crisis prompted ongoing discussions with state and federal governments with the aim of releasing more water from upstream to ensure the survival of the river. In 2009 a temporary levee (called the Clayton Regulator) was constructed between Clayton Bay and the north east side of Hindmarsh Island. The Regulator was put in place to protect the Goolwa Channel and its tributaries from the danger of acid sulfate soils. The low water level was exposing the river bed and scientific evidence warned of the devastating impact of acidification of the Lower Lakes region. The Regulator immediately increased the water level between the Regulator and the Goolwa Barrage. In 2010 increased rainfall and water from upstream allowed the Regulator at Clayton Bay to be substantially removed. The rainfall has replenished much of the river and lower lakes. In late 2010 some gates on the Goolwa Barrage were opened for the first time in many years to allow fresh water to flow to the Murray Mouth. Continued rainfalls combined with flooding upstream in NSW and Victoria has led to massive flows down the River Murray and by January 2011 all the gates on the Goolwa Barrage were open.  Culture  Every odd-numbered year, Goolwa hosts the South Australian Wooden Boat Festival. The town is a popular holiday destination and home to the PS Oscar W, a paddle steamer. Goolwa, along with the neighbouring towns of Middleton and Port Elliot and the city of Victor Harbor have in the 2000s enjoyed a nationally recognised \\"sea change\\" boom, with people moving there from more metropolitan areas for an improved lifestyle on the coast. The local councils are left with the dilemma of how to provide sufficient services for the influx of new residents, while at the same time not spoiling the character and appeal of the area that attracts newcomers. In March 2007, Goolwa was declared a Cittaslow by visiting Cittaslow representatives. Goolwa was the first non- European town to gain Cittaslow status. On 22 January 2010 the 4th stage of the Tour Down Under finished at Goolwa. As part of the event more than 8,000 cyclists, that participated in the preceding Mutual Community Challenge Tour, rode into Goolwa on the day.

The road started in what is now the Sea Mills area of Bristol, near the present- day site of Sea Mills railway station, and ran in a north-north-easterly direction via the Ridge Way section towards Gloucester. The name of the village has appeared on various documents throughout history as Rugewei (in 1191), Rugweye (1248), Rigweye (1276) and as both Rudgeway and Rudgewaye in 1587. The village Rudgeway is located in the parish of Alveston and is spread out along the upper edge of the escarpment above the Severn floodplain on the A38 road. It lies approximately north of the Almondsbury Interchange between the villages of Almondsbury and Alveston, to the north of Bristol. The remains of St Helen's Church The village contains a small number of listed buildings, including the grade II-listed Old Church Farm. Formerly known as Alveston Manor, it was originally built as a house for the Veel family in the late 16th century and features their coat of arms above the front door along with the year 1634. By the end of the 18th century it was being used as a farmhouse and in 1960 the property was purchased by the aircraft engine manufacturer Bristol Siddeley, who were later purchased by and amagamated into Rolls-Royce Limited. Rolls-Royce used the property as a conference centre and for visitors' accommodation until 2017 when it was bought from them and converted into a hotel. Within the grounds of Old Church Farm is the ruin of St Helen's Church, which is also grade II-listed. All that remains of the building now is the tower and a portion of the nave wall. The remains of the church are also a scheduled monument. The neighbouring Pypers estate also has a number of buildings and structures that are all grade II-listed. These include main house itself, originally built in the late 18th century with additions made in the 19th and 20th centuries and built in the classical style, the entrance gates and surrounding piers and walls, and the stables and adjacent wall and piers. The only other listed building in Rudgeway is the Grade II Tockington Park Farmhouse. Built in the 17th century and extended in the nineteenth, its barn is said to contain a portion of Roman wall. A small former Methodist chapel, known as Ebenezer Chapel, was built in the village in 1896 and closed in 2001 and has since been converted into a private dwelling. There is one pub in Rudgeway, The Masons Arms, which lies at the northern edge of the village on the A38 Gloucester Road. The village was formerly home to Silverhill School, an independent preparatory school now based in Winterbourne. The establishment took its name from Silverhill Brake, the road on which it was located, and was based there from 1949 until 1992. Since 1994 the former school building, known as Silverhill, has been home to a market research and data processing company. Demographics The village is split across two UK census Output Areas (numbered E00075103 and E00075104 by the Office for National Statistics) which combined were estimated to have a population of 593 in 2015. These output areas covered the village of Rudgeway as well as a few surrounding farms and isolated dwellings. It is an area of relatively low deprivation, with 2019 figures ranking the Lower Layer Super Output Area in which the village resides as the 21,849th most deprived neighbourhood out of the 32,844 in England in terms of Index of Multiple Deprivation, putting it in the 40% least deprived areas nationally. This was a big fall from 2015 when it was ranked 29,860th, putting it in the 10% least deprived areas of England.

Within the genus Oryzomys of the family Cricetidae, it may have been most closely related to the mainland species O. albiventer. Since its first description in 1898, most authors have regarded it as a distinct species, but it has also been classified as a mere subspecies of the marsh rice rat (O. palustris). After its discovery in 1897, it has never been recorded again and it is now considered extinct; the presence of introduced black rats on Mar√≠a Madre may have contributed to its extinction. Oryzomys nelsoni was a large species, distinguished in particular by its long tail, robust skull, and large incisors. It was reddish to yellowish above and mostly white below. Its diet may have included plant material and small animals. Taxonomy Oryzomys nelsoni was collected by Edward William Nelson and Edward Goldman in May 1897 and never found again.Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p. 114; Nelson, 1899a, pp. 7‚Äì8 Their visit for the Biological Survey of the United States Department of Agriculture was one of the first scientific exploration of the islands.Nelson, 1899a, pp. 7‚Äì8; Merriam, 1899, p. 13 Clinton Hart Merriam identified the mammals they obtained, including four specimens of Oryzomys nelsoni, which were deposited in the United States National Museum and remain there.Merriam, 1898, p. 13; Nelson, 1899a, p. 15; Carleton and Arroyo- Cabrales, 2009, p. 122 He named it as a species of the genus Oryzomys, Oryzomys nelsoni; the specific name honors Nelson.Merriam, 1898, p. 15; √Ålvarez-Casta√±eda and M√©ndez, 2003, p. 2 Investigators have generally retained it as a species distinct from other Oryzomys, but in 1971 Hershkovitz listed it as one of many subspecies of Oryzomys palustris, which he envisaged as a wide-ranging species encompassing what is now the marsh rice rat (O. palustris) of the southern and eastern United States, O. couesi of Central America, and several other species with more limited distributions.Musser and Carleton, 2005, pp. 1147, 1152‚Äì1153; Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p. 116 In his 1918 revision of North American Oryzomys, Goldman considered O. nelsoni to be most closely related to the nearest mainland subspecies of O. couesi, O. couesi mexicanus. In 2009, Michael Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo- Cabrales revised the Oryzomys of western Mexico and confirmed that O. nelsoni is a very distinct species. Their morphometrical analysis found some resemblance between the species and Oryzomys albiventer of interior mainland Mexico, and they suggested that although O. nelsoni likely represents an old, distinctive lineage, it may have derived from a common ancestor with O. albiventer.Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p. 110 Oryzomys nelsoni is one of about eight species in the genus Oryzomys, which occurs from the eastern United States (O. palustris) into northwestern South America (O. gorgasi).Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p. 106 O. nelsoni is further part of the O. couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O. couesi and also includes various other species with more limited and peripheral distributions.Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p. 117 Many aspects of the systematics of the O. couesi section remain unclear and it is likely that the current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group.Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p. 107 Oryzomys previously included many other species, which were progressively removed in various studies culminating in a contribution by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that removed more than forty species from the genus.Weksler et al., 2006, table 1 All are classified in the tribe Oryzomyini (\\"rice rats\\"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species,Weksler, 2006, p. 3 and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.Musser and Carleton, 2005 Common names proposed for this species include Nelson rice rat,Goldman, 1918, p. 46 Nelson's rice rat,√Ålvarez- Casta√±eda and M√©ndez, 2003, p. 1 Nelson's oryzomys,Musser and Carleton, 2005, p. 1152 and Tres Marias Island rice rat. Description Skull of Oryzomys nelsoni, seen from below.Goldman, 1918, plate II, fig. 1a Oryzomys nelsoni was a large and long-tailed Oryzomys; its tail was longer than that of any other western Mexican Oryzomys. The upperparts were ochraceous to buff, most richly so on the rump, and paler further to the front and low on the flanks. On the head and the back, blackish hairs somewhat darkened the overall color. The underparts were white, with lead-colored underfur that was visible in some places. The ears were covered on both sides with scanty grayish hairs. The large hindfeet were sparsely covered with pale hairs. The tail was largely dark, but the underside of the basal one third to one half was light yellow. Oryzomys nelsoni was distinctive in its large skull with broad, well-developed incisors and a strong front part (rostrum) that is strongly curved downwards.Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p. 121 In O. albiventer, the rostrum and incisors were not as massive, but the molars are larger. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, was broad and the incisive foramina, which perforated the palate between the incisors and the molars, were relatively short. Total length in the four known specimens is , averaging ; head and body length is , averaging ; tail length is , averaging ; and hindfoot length is , averaging .Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, table 2 Ecology and extinction Nelson and Goldman found the species only in a damp, herbaceous site now known as the \\"Sacatal\\" near a spring high on Mar√≠a Madre Island, the largest of the Islas Mar√≠as off the coast of Nayarit, western Mexico,√Ålvarez-Casta√±eda and M√©ndez, 2003, p. 1; Carleton and Arroyo- Cabrales, 2009, p. 114 and Nelson wrote that it was rare. He gave the elevation of this place as 1800 ft,Nelson, 1899b, p. 16 which √Ålvarez- Casta√±eda and M√©ndez converted to 550 m, but in his 1918 paper, Goldman gave 800 ft instead, which Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales in 2009 converted to 245 m.Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p. 114 The next survey of small mammals on the island took place in March 1976 by a team led by Don E. Wilson. They failed to collect O. nelsoni and instead found only the introduced black rat (Rattus rattus) at the locality where Nelson and Goldman had collected O. nelsoni; this species may have contributed to the decline of the indigenous rodent.Wilson, 1991, p. 239; Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p. 114 The species is now considered extinct,√Ålvarez-Casta√±eda and M√©ndez, 2003, p. 1; Musser and Carleton, 2005, p. 1152; Timm et al., 2008; Carleton and Arroyo- Cabrales, 2009, p. 114 although as late as 2002 the Mexican government listed it as \\"threatened\\".√Ålvarez-Casta√±eda and M√©ndez, 2003, p. 2 Another Islas Mar√≠as endemic, the deermouse Peromyscus madrensis, still occurred on Mar√≠a Madre in 1976.Musser and Carleton, 2005, p. 1071; Carleton and Arroyo- Cabrales, 2009, p. 114 Oryzomys nelsoni is thought to have fed on plant material such as weeds, fruit, and seeds, and more rarely on animals such as fish and invertebrates.

It was released on 12 May 1978, through record label United Artists. Background As with The Stranglers' first two albums, Black and White was produced by Martin Rushent. The album sees The Stranglers adopting a more experimental approach to song structures and time signatures (for example, \\"Curfew\\" features 7/4 time). The band recorded a version of \\"Sweden\\" sung in Swedish, called \\"Sverige\\" and released it in Sweden. The song was partly inspired by Cornwell's PhD placement at Lund University in the mid-1970s. In an anecdote related in the Swedish online magazine, Blaskan, it is stated that the song was inspired by a disastrous visit to Sweden during a European tour, when a gig was violently interrupted by a gang of \\"raggare\\" (greasers).\\"I huvudet p√• en gammal punkare\\", 2006 article in online Swedish magazine, Blaskan  http://www.blaskan.nu/Blaskan/Nummer44/Punkspecial/i_huvudet_pa_en_gammal_punkare_capo.html The song title \\"Death and Night and Blood\\" is taken from a line from Yukio Mishima's novel Confessions of a Mask. The song \\"In the Shadows\\" had previously been released as the B-side to the band's 1977 single \\"No More Heroes\\". Release Black and White was released on 12 May 1978. The album peaked at No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart, spending eighteen weeks in the chart. The first 75,000 LPs came with a free white vinyl 7\\" composed of three tracks: \\"Walk On By\\" (a cover of the Burt Bacharach and Hal David song written for and originally recorded by Dionne Warwick), \\"Mean to Me\\" and \\"Tits\\". The US version of the album, on the A&M; label, was pressed on black and white marbled vinyl, but came without the three-track single. Singles released from the album were \\"Nice 'n' Sleazy\\", b/w \\"Shut Up\\", and \\"Walk On By\\", b/w \\"Tank\\" and \\"Old Codger\\". \\"Old Codger\\" featured a guest vocal from jazz singer George Melly. An edited version of \\"Walk On By\\" with \\"Tank\\" was also pressed as a double A-side radio-play single. Most of these tracks were included in the remastered 2001 CD re-issue of the album. Critical reception Retrospective critics generally view Black and White in a lesser light to the band's previous albums. AllMusic called it \\"arguably the weakest\\" of The Stranglers' first three albums, \\"yet it still has some absolutely stunning moments.\\" Trouser Press wrote, \\"Black and White lacks only good songs.

He was a New Democratic Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 1995. Background White grew up in Oshawa, Ontario. He graduated with an Honours BA (University of Toronto), a Bachelor in Social Work (BSW), a Master in Social Work (Wilfrid Laurier University), and a Research Diploma in Social Work (University of Toronto). White is currently self-employed as a family counsellor and social worker. His work emphasizes mediation and family assessment. He is married to Norah Love and they have three adult children: Amanda, Devin, and Lenore. Politics White became involved in politics because he was concerned about the tax burden and the rising cost of raising a family. He said, \\"Nothing is more important in terms of family values than having bread on the table.\\" White had been involved in social justice, cooperative and political campaigns since high school. He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1990 provincial election, defeating incumbent Liberal Allan Furlong and Progressive Conservative Jim Flaherty by over 2,000 votes in the Greater Toronto Area riding of Durham Centre. The NDP won a majority in this election and White served as the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Municipal Affairs on two occasions between 1992 and 1995. White dealt especially with the Office of the Greater Toronto Area and participated in the creation of the Waterfront Trail. Drummond White also drove the reforms to the Municipal and Planning Acts through provincial parliament. In 1992, White and fellow Durham MPP Jim Wiseman became involved in a minor controversy when it was found they were billing taxpayers for the cost of renting a shared apartment in Toronto. He claimed that working long hours as an MPP justified his need for the apartment. Due to the publicity, he and Wiseman ended the lease in August 1992. In December 1992, White moved a resolution advocating the creation of a regulating body for social workers in Ontario. At the time, Ontario was the only province that did not have a regulating body for social workers. A spokesman for the Ministry of Social Services said that legislation for social work was a low priority. While he was not successful in getting a bill passed during his time as MPP, a similar bill called the Social Work and Social Service Work Act was enacted in 1998. Drummond was the final witness and speaker before the legislative committee that dealt with the bill and was pleased when this legislation was finally enacted. In February 1994, White was charged with common assault. As a result of the charges he resigned from the NDP caucus and also from his role as parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Municipal Affairs. He sat as an Independent member until his case was resolved. In March 1994, a judge dismissed the charge against White. It turned out that he had confronted his 14-year-old daughter over cigarettes and tried to search her jacket. A tug of war ensued which led to the assault charge. The judge, John Payne said, \\"There was an indirect use of force which could be construed as an assault, but there was no physical assault.\\" The incident was reported at school the next day which was why the charge was laid. \\"Mr. White was concerned about his daughter smoking,\\" said Mr. Payne. \\"He acted like any concerned parent would.\\" Shortly after the trial, White returned to the NDP caucus and his role as assistant to Minister of Municipal Affairs. In the 1995 provincial election, White was defeated in his bid for re-election, finishing third against Conservative Jim Flaherty and Liberal Allan Furlong. Later life After leaving politics, White returned to his profession as a social worker. In 1996 he served as co- chair to the Durham Region Coalition for Social Justice which sought to prevent the Harris government from reducing social services. He also participated in other Durham advocacy groups such as Save Our Schools and Save Our Shores. He joined the board of the Canadian Association of Social Workers. In 2008, he was elected Secretary-Treasurer. In 2005, he was chosen as the Ontario recipient of the Canadian Association of Social Workers' Distinguished Service Award. Drummond was also on the Board of the Ontario Association of Social Workers (OASW) and was elected Vice-President in charge of Social and Professional Advocacy. In addition to social and professional activity, Drummond has also been very involved in his local community serving as a Lay Chaplain with the Unitarian church in Durham (UUCD) and acting in community theatre.

History Fire-scarred farmland, February 2007 On 11 February 2007, a fire began on private property near the north-west corner of the national park, around eight kilometres west of the Porongurup village. The fire spread along the rear boundaries of several properties and into the national park. Fire crews helped prevent the fire spreading to nearby housing throughout Sunday night but on Monday afternoon (12 February) it jumped Porongurup-Mt Barker Road and spread into private property to the north-east of the village centre. One private residence and a number of farm sheds and buildings were destroyed and other buildings seriously damaged in the fire. Fire crews, including aerial support from six water bomber planes, battled the blaze and by Tuesday morning it was effectively under control. By Wednesday morning (14 February) the fire had burnt through around 95% of the national park and several farms and wineries showed the scars of the fire.Albany & Great Southern Weekender, 15 February 2007 It was reportedly the most devastating fire in the region since the 1960s. Less than a week after the fire began, a committee was formed to take charge of remedial work in the community and in a show of resilience, local wineries still held their annual wine festival a few weeks later. Despite the national park remaining closed to visitors, the annual Art in the Park exhibition was allowed to go ahead in early April. Sections of the park, including the Castle Rock walk trail and the Tree in The Rock picnic area, were reopened to the general public in September 2007.

The Aerosonde was developed by Insitu, and is now manufactured by Aerosonde Ltd, which is a strategic business of AAI Corporation. The Aerosonde is powered by a modified Enya R120 model aircraft engine, and carries on board a small computer, meteorological instruments, and a GPS receiver for navigation. It is also used by the United States Armed Forces for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR). Design and development On August 21, 1998, a Phase 1 Aerosonde nicknamed \\"Laima\\", after the ancient Latvian deity of good fortune, completed a 2,031 mile (3,270 km) flight across the Atlantic Ocean. This was the first crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by a UAV; at the time, it was also the smallest aircraft ever to cross the Atlantic (the smallest aircraft record was subsequently broken by the Spirit of Butts Farm UAV). Launched from a roof rack of a moving car due to its lack of undercarriage, Laima flew from Newfoundland, Canada to Benbecula, an island off the coast of Scotland in 26 hours 45 minutes in stormy weather, using approximately 1.5 U.S. gallons (1.25 imperial gallons or 5.7 litres) of gasoline (petrol). Other than for take-off and landing, the flight was autonomous, without external control, at an altitude of 5,500 ft (1,680 meters). Aerosondes have also been the first unmanned aircraft to penetrate tropical cyclones, with an initial mission in 2001 followed by eye penetrations in 2005. Operational history On 5 March 2012, the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) awarded AAI a contract to provide the Aerosonde-G for their Mid-Endurance UAS II program. The catapult- launched air vehicle has a takeoff weight depending on engine type, with endurance of over 10 hours and an electro-optic/infrared and laser-pointer payload.U.S. Chooses Aerosonde, Other UAVs for ISR Services - Ainonline.com, 16 March 2012 The Aerosonde has been employed by SOCOM and U.S. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) under the designation MQ-19 under service provision contracts. A typical system comprises four air vehicles and two ground control stations that are accommodated in tents or tailored to fit in most vehicles.

A driver picks up these non-paying passengers (known as \\"slugs\\" or \\"sluggers\\") at key locations, as having these additional passengers means that the driver can qualify to use an HOV lane or enjoy toll reduction. While the practice is most common and most publicized in the congested Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, slugging also occurs in San Francisco, Houston, and other cities. Background In order to relieve traffic volume during the morning and evening rush hours, high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes that require more than one person per automobile were introduced in many major American cities to encourage carpooling and greater use of public transport, first appearing in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area in 1975. The failure of the new lanes to relieve congestion, and frustration over failures of public-transport systems and high fuel prices, led to the creation in the 1970s of \\"slugging\\", a form of hitchhiking between strangers that is beneficial to both parties, as drivers and passengers are able to use the HOV lane for a quicker trip. While passengers are able to travel for free, or cheaper than via other modes of travel, and HOV drivers sometimes pay no tolls, \\"slugs are, above all, motivated by time saved, not money pocketed\\". Concern for the environment is not their primary motivation; Virginia drivers of hybrid automobiles are, for example, eligible to use HOV lanes with no passengers. In the Washington area --with the second-busiest traffic during rush hour in the United States and Canada --slugging occurs on Interstates 95, 66 and 395 between Washington and northern Virginia. As of 2006, there were about 6,459 daily slugging participants there.Chan, Nelson and Susan Shaheen. \\"Ridesharing in North America: Past, Present, and Future.\\" Transportation Research Board, 2010. In the San Francisco Bay Area, with the third-busiest rush hour, casual carpooling occurs on Interstate 80 between the East Bay and San Francisco. As of 1998, 8,000 to 9,000 people slugged in San Francisco daily. However, after bridge tolls were levied on carpool vehicles in 2010, casual carpooling saw a significant decline and etiquette became more uncertain.Lee, Linda and Karen Frick. \\"San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Congestion Pricing.\\" Bay Area Toll Authority, 2011. Slugging also occurs in tenth-busiest Houston, at a rate of 900 daily in 2007, and in Pittsburgh.News Story - Slugs and Bodysnatchers Slugging is shown to be effective in reducing vehicle travel distance as a form of ridesharing.S. Ma, O. Wolfson. (2013) Analysis and Evaluation of the Slugging Form of Ridesharing. Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, 2013. Slugging is more used during morning commutes than evening commutes. The most common mode that slugging replaces is transit bus.Mark W. Burris and Justin R. Winn. Slugging in Houston‚ÄîCasual Carpool Passenger Characteristics. Journal of Public Transportation, Vol. 9, No. 5, 2006. David D. Friedman's The Machinery of Freedom proposed a similar system (which he referred to as \\"jitney transit\\") in the 1970s. However, his plan assumed that passengers would be expected to pay for their transit, and that security measures such as electronic identification cards (recording the identity of both driver and passenger in a database readily available to police, in the event one or both parties disappeared) would be needed in order for people to feel safe. Although slugging is informal, ad hoc, and free, in 30 years no violence or crime was reported from Washington D.C. slugging until October 2010, when former Sergeant Major of the Army Gene McKinney struck one of his passengers with his car after they threatened to report his reckless driving to the police. Etymology The term slug (used as both a noun and a verb) came from bus drivers who had to determine if the people waiting at the stop were genuine bus passengers or merely people wanting a free lift, in the same way that they look out for fake coins‚Äîor \\"slugs\\"‚Äîbeing thrown into the fare- collection box. General practices In practice, slugging involves the creation of free, unofficial ad hoc carpool networks, often with published routes and pick-up and drop-off locations. In the morning, sluggers gather at local businesses and at government-run locations such as park and ride-like facilities or bus stops and subway stations with lines of sluggers. Drivers pull up to the queue for the route they will follow and either display a sign or call out the designated drop-off point they are willing to drive to and how many passengers they can take; in the Washington area the Pentagon--the largest place of employment in the United States, with 25,000 workers--is a popular destination. Enough riders fill the car and the driver departs. In the evening, the routes reverse. Many unofficial rules of etiquette exist, and websites allow sluggers to post warnings about those who break them. Some Washington D.C. rules are: * The slug first in line gets the next ride to their destination and also gets to choose the front or back seat. Slugs should never take a ride out of turn. * Drivers are not to pick up sluggers en route to or standing outside the line, a practice referred to as \\"body snatching\\". * A woman is not to be left in the line alone, for her safety. * No eating, smoking, or putting on of makeup is allowed. * The driver has full control of the radio and climate controls. * Windows may not be opened unless the driver approves. * No money is exchanged or requested, as the driver and slugs all benefit from slugging. * Driver and passengers say \\"Thank you\\" at the end.Etiquette and Rules of Slug Lines Government involvement While local governments sometimes aid sluggers by posting signs labeled with popular destinations for people to queue at, slugging is organized by its participants and no slug line has ever been created by government. Slug lines are organized and maintained by volunteers. Government officials have become more aware of sluggers' needs when planning changes that affect their behavior, and solicit their suggestions. The Virginia Department of Transportation even includes links on their governmental webpage regarding slugging.High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lanes - Rules and FAQs. Virginiadot.org.

A similar system is also used in Cuba. In India, it is illegal for drivers to randomly pick up commuters from the public roads and there are evidences that such drivers have been fined.

For example, ascending scales would accompany lyrics about going up; slow, dark music would accompany lyrics about death. Historical development Tone painting of words goes at least as far back as Gregorian chant. Little musical patterns are musical words that express not only emotive ideas such as joy but theological meanings as well in the Gregorian. For instance, the pattern FA-MI-SOL-LA signifies the humiliation and death of Christ and His resurrection into glory. FA-MI signifies deprecation, while SOL is the note of the resurrection, and LA is above the resurrection, His heavenly glory (\\"surrexit Jesus\\"). Such musical words are placed on words from the Biblical Latin text; for instance when FA-MI-SOL-LA is placed on \\"et libera\\" (e.g., introit for Sexagesima Sunday) in the Christian faith it signifies that Christ liberates us from sin through His death and resurrection. Word painting developed especially in the late 16th century among Italian and English composers of madrigals, to such an extent that word painting devices came to be called madrigalisms. While it originated in secular music, it made its way into other vocal music of the period. While this mannerism is a prominent feature of madrigals of the late 16th century, including both Italian and English, it encountered sharp criticism from some composers. Thomas Campion, writing in the preface to his first book of lute songs 1601, said of it: \\"... where the nature of everie word is precisely expresst in the Note ‚Ä¶ such childish observing of words is altogether ridiculous.\\"Thomas Campion, First Booke of Ayres (1601), quoted in von Fischer, Grove online Word painting flourished well into the Baroque music period. One famous, well-known example occurs in Handel's Messiah, where a tenor aria contains Handel's setting of the text: :Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill made low; the crooked straight, and the rough places plain. (Isaiah 40:4) In Handel's melody, the word \\"valley\\" ends on a low note, \\"exalted\\" is a rising figure; \\"mountain\\" forms a peak in the melody, and \\"hill\\" a smaller one, while \\"low\\" is another low note. \\"Crooked\\" is sung to a rapid figure of four different notes, while \\"straight\\" is sung on a single note, and in \\"the rough places plain,\\" \\"the rough places\\" is sung over short, separate notes whereas the final word \\"plain\\" is extended over several measures in a series of long notes. This can be seen in the following example: 800px In popular music A modern example of word painting from the late 20th century occurs in the song \\"Friends in Low Places\\" by Garth Brooks. During the chorus, Brooks sings the word \\"low\\" on a low note. Similarly, on The Who's album Tommy, the song \\"Smash the Mirror\\" contains the line :Can you hear me? Or do I surmise :That you feel me? Can you feel my temper :Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise.... Each repetition of 'rise' is a semitone higher than the last, making this an especially overt example of word-painting. \\"Hallelujah\\" by Leonard Cohen carries a significant example of the text painting, \\"It goes like this the fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift, the baffled king composing hallelujah.\\", signifying the movement of the keys and the chord progression, a kind of ambiguous oscillation between moods. Justin Timberlake's song \\"What Goes Around\\" is another popular example of text painting. The lyrics :What goes around, goes around, goes around :Comes all the way back around descend an octave and then return to the upper octave, as though it was going in around in a circle. In the chorus of \\"Up Where We Belong\\", the melody rises during the words \\"Love lift us up\\". In Johnny Cash's \\"Ring of Fire\\", there is an inverse word painting where 'down, down, down' is sung to the notes rising, and 'higher' is sung dropping from a higher to a lower note. In Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart's \\"My Romance,\\" the melody jumps to a higher note on the word \\"rising\\" in the line, \\"My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain.\\" In recordings of George and Ira Gershwin's \\"They Can't Take That Away from Me,\\" Ella Fitzgerald and others intentionally sing the wrong note on the word \\"key\\" in the phrase, \\"The way you sing off- key.\\" Another inverse happens during the song \\"A Spoonful of Sugar\\" from Mary Poppins, as, during the line \\"Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down,\\" the words \\"go down\\" leap from a lower to a higher note. At the beginning of the first chorus in Luis Fonsi's \\"Despacito\\", the music is slowed down when the word \\"despacito\\" (slowly) is performed. In Secret Garden's \\"You Raise Me Up\\", the words \\"you raise me up\\" are sung in a rising scale at the beginning of the chorus. Queen use word painting in many of their songs (in particular those written by lead singer Freddie Mercury). In \\"Somebody to Love\\", each time the word 'Lord' occurs it is sung as the highest note at the end of an ascending passage. In the same piece, the lyrics 'I've got no rhythm; I just keep losing my beat' fall on off beats to create the impression that he is out of time. In BTS's \\"Lie\\", the whole song is written in minor key to create tensity and dramatic irony. The only lyric that is written in major is \\"Caught in a lie\\" which represents the lie of the key signature.

It is over wide from west to east, stretching from the highway between Mount Barker and Cranbrook eastward past Gnowangerup. The Stirling Range is protected by the Stirling Range National Park, which was gazetted in 1913, and has an area of .  Environment  Geology = The mountains are formed of metamorphic rock derived from quartz sandstones and shales deposited during the Paleoproterozoic Era, between 2,016 and 1,215 million years ago (based on U-Th-Pb isotope geochronology of monazite crystals). The sediments were subsequently metamorphosed 1,215 million years ago, and later folded during reactivation of basement structures recording lateral displacements between Antarctica and Australia. Despite the relative youth of the mountains, the soils remain very poor, creating the species-rich heathland flora. =Climate= As the only vertical obstacle to weather in any direction, the range tends to alter weather patterns around itself. Its upper slopes receive significantly more rainfall than surrounding areas. The branch of the Kalgan River that forms the southwestern border of the park is fed in large part from precipitation falling in the western half of the range. The annual rainfall on the plains around the park is quite low compared with the rainy Porongurups to the south, averaging only 575 millimetres (23 inches) on the southern side and as little as 400 millimetres (16 inches) in Borden on the northern side. Although no rain gauges have been placed on the high peaks, the highest rainfall is estimated to be about 1000 mm (39 in) near Coyanarup Peak and Bluff Knoll. This is supported by distinctly moist-climate pockets of vegetation in some high valleys. Most rain falls between May and August, with summer being very frequently completely dry around Borden for over a month and having typically very light showers in the south and on the peaks. Temperatures in the lowlands are generally warm. In the summer, average maxima typically are around 30 ¬∞C (86 ¬∞F) in Borden and about 27 ¬∞C (80 ¬∞F) in the southern plains. Summer minima range from about 16 ¬∞C (60 ¬∞F) in the south to 18 ¬∞C (64 ¬∞F) in Borden. In the winter, maximum temperatures typically are a very pleasant 16 ¬∞C (60 ¬∞F) and minima are about 8 ¬∞C (46.4 ¬∞F). On Bluff Knoll, winter temperatures range from maxima of about 11 ¬∞C (52 ¬∞F) to minima of 3 ¬∞C (37 ¬∞F). These are the lowest temperatures in Western Australia and consequently the Stirling Range occasionally receives snowfalls--the only place in Western Australia to regularly do so, though usually it is very light. Snow has been reported as early as 19 April 2019 and as late as 19 November 1992, but is mostly confined to the period from June to September. =Flora and fauna= The range is one of the richest areas for flora in the world. The low-nutrient soils support five major vegetation communities: (1) shrubland and (2) mallee-heathland at higher altitudes; and (3) woodland, (4) wetland and (5) salt lake communities on lower slopes and plains.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Stirling Range. Downloaded from on 2011-10-25. Ninety families, 384 genera, and over 1500 plant species occur there, 87 of which are found nowhere else. This represents more than a third of the known flora of the southwest, and includes more species of wildflowers than in the entire British Isles.Department of Environment and Conservation, 2008, Park Finder: Stirling Ranges National Park. The range has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of endangered short-billed black cockatoos and western whipbirds, and is visited by endangered long- billed black-cockatoos. Significant biome-restricted or range-restricted bird species found in the range include red-capped and regent parrots, western rosellas, rufous treecreepers, red-winged and blue-breasted fairywrens, purple-gaped honeyeaters, western spinebills, western thornbills, western yellow and white-breasted robins, and red-eared firetails. The range is an important site for endemic mygalomorph spiders, and for land snails. Some 20 species of native mammals, including the reintroduced numbat, have been recorded. History Heath habitat looking west from lookout in approx centre of ranges The plains in the Stirling Range region were the hunting grounds for small groups of Indigenous Australians for thousands of years before European settlement. At least two tribes frequented the area: the Qaaniyan people in the west, and the Koreng people in the east. The Stirling Range played an important role in their culture, appearing in a number of Dreamtime stories. The first recorded sighting of the Stirling Ranges by a European explorer was by Matthew Flinders on 5 January 1802. While sailing along the south coast of Australia, just east of King George Sound, he noted at a distance of eight leagues (44 km) inland a chain of rugged mountains, the easternmost of which he named Mount Rugged (now called Bluff Knoll). An army garrison was established at King George Sound in 1826, and the following year the commanding officer, Major Edmund Lockyer, explored the land north of the Sound. On 11 February 1827, he observed in the distance mountains running east and west about 40 miles. Alexander Collie explored to the north of the Sound in 1831. On 29 April, he described the Stirling Range and recorded names for the main peaks. The following year, Robert Dale led an expedition to the Range. On 24 January 1832, he made the first recorded ascent of a peak in the Stirling Range, scaling Toolbrunup. Late in 1835, Governor James Stirling and John Septimus Roe led an expedition from Albany to Perth. They first saw the Stirling Ranges on 3 November, and on travelling closer to them the following day, Roe gave them their name. Early exploitation of the Stirling Ranges included cutting of sandalwood and kangaroo hunting. The Ranges were never formally taken up for grazing, probably because of the many poison bushes in the area. However, squatters ran sheep to the south of the Range in the 1850s, and in the 1860s a selection was taken up at the base of Mount Trio. The area that is now the Stirling Range National Park was temporarily reserved in April 1908, and formally gazetted as Western Australia's third national park in June 1913. Stirling Range from the north Attractions and activities Notable features include Toolbrunup, Bluff Knoll (the tallest peak for a thousand kilometres or more in any direction and most popular tourist attraction), and a silhouette called The Sleeping Princess which is visible from the Porongurup Range. Popular recreational activities include bushwalking, abseiling and gliding. Camping is not permitted within the park boundaries. =Major peaks= Bluff Knoll, as seen from near the corner of Chester Pass Road and Bluff Knoll access road * Bluff Knoll‚Äî34¬∞22'S 118¬∞15'E, * Mount Hassell‚Äî34¬∞22'S 118¬∞04'E, * Mount Magog‚Äî34¬∞23'S 117¬∞56'E, * Mount Trio‚Äî34¬∞20'S 118¬∞06'E, * Talyuberlup Peak‚Äî34¬∞24'S 117¬∞57'E, * Toolbrunup‚Äî34¬∞23'S 118¬∞02'E, ReferencesFurther reading * Carolyn Thomson, Graham Hall and Gordon Friend (eds) (1993).

Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, it was acquired by Eidos Interactive in 1998. After Square Enix's acquisition of Eidos in 2009, it became a subsidiary of Square Enix. Crystal Dynamics was the first licensed developer for 3DO. The company's mascot was the video game character Gex the Gecko until 2000. History Crystal Dynamics was formed on 8 July 1992 by Sega veterans Judy Lang, Madeline Canepa, and David Shannon Morse. Crystal was the first licensed developer for 3DO, a gaming hardware platform simultaneously funded by Kleiner Perkins. Mark Cerny joined the company, but he left to work for Universal Interactive Studios. In 1993, Strauss Zelnick, president of 20th Century Fox's film studio, was hired to run Crystal Dynamics. This made national news and helped to touch off the frenzy of multimedia investments of the mid-1990s. A 1993 editorial in Electronic Gaming Monthly declared that \\"the hottest new video game company on the upscale scene is definitely Crystal Dynamics.\\" Due chiefly to the unexpectedly slow growth of the next generation gaming market, Crystal Dynamics's massive expansion in its early years failed to pay off. In 1996 new CEO Ted Ardel announced the company was cutting one third of its workforce and stepping aside as a publisher to focus strictly on games development. For several months the company functioned without a president, with Ardel managing the day-to-day operations until Rob Dyer was promoted to president on April 4, 1997. Crystal Dynamics had been most known for developing Legacy of Kain and Gex. The studio was also entrusted the development of the best-selling Tomb Raider franchise after its original developer, Core Design, failed to gain critical or commercial success with their later Tomb Raider games, and released its first game in the series in 2006, Tomb Raider: Legend, which was the fastest-selling game in the series, selling 4.5 million units worldwide. Crystal Dynamics co-developed Tomb Raider: Anniversary with developer Buzz Monkey Software. A remake of the first Tomb Raider game, it was released in June 2007. The next installment, Tomb Raider: Underworld, was released in October 2008. Crystal Dynamics' next release was the spin-off title Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, which did not feature the Tomb Raider branding despite utilizing the lead character. In 2009, Crystal Dynamics laid off over 30 employees to refocus their efforts on the Tomb Raider games only. On January 3, 2012, studio community manager Meagan Marie said that the studio would be revealing a new intellectual property (IP) in 2012. In a podcast, released on June 23, 2012, executive producer Scot Amos said Crystal Dynamics new IP will be \\"fresh and familiar\\" and offer a similar experience to the new Tomb Raider game. This was followed by Tomb Raider in 2013, a reboot which introduced a new backstory for Lara. In December 2015, Square Enix announced that Darrell Gallagher, the studio's head, had left the company. His role in the company was replaced by Scot Amos and Ron Rosenberg. In 2016, Brian Horton, director of the game Rise of the Tomb Raider, left the company. He had previously undertaken the role of senior art director on the Tomb Raider reboot in 2013. On January 26, 2017, Square Enix announced a partnership with Marvel Entertainment to create multiple video games based on Marvel properties, the first of which was announced as Avengers, based on the comics of the same name, which would be developed by Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. On August 13, 2018, Square Enix announced that Crystal Dynamics had opened a satellite studio based in Bellevue, Washington called Crystal Northwest, which will assist the development of the Avengers game and future Crystal Dynamics projects.

Due to the sticky nature of the crude oil, the oil clings to the tank walls, and such oil adds to the cargo 'remaining on board' (the ROB). By COWing the tanks, the amount of ROB is significantly reduced, and with the current high cost of oil, the financial savings are significant, both for the Charterer and the Shipowner.

It replaced the load on top and seawater washing systems, both of which involved discharging oil-contaminated water into the sea. MARPOL 73/78 made this mandatory equipment for oil tankers of 20,000 tons or greater deadweight. Although COWing is most notable for actual tankers, the current chairman for Hashimoto Technical Service, Hashimoto Akiyoshi, applied this method in washing refinery plant oil tanks in Japan. Hashimoto is currently using this method in the Kyushu, Chugoku, and Tohouku regions in Japan.http://www1.ocn.ne.jp/~hts.wak/473/494.html __FORCETOC__ Seawater washing Originally oil tankers used one set of tanks for cargo and about one third of the same tanks were for water ballast on their empty trips. High pressure, hot, seawater jets were used to clean the tanks and the mixture of seawater and residue called slops discharged into the sea, as was the oil- contaminated ballast water. The 1954 OILPOL Convention attempted to reduce the harm by prohibiting such discharges within of most land and of certain particularly sensitive areas. Load on top The discharges from seawater washing were still considered a problem and during the 1960s the load on top approach began to be adopted. The mixture of cleaning water and residue was pumped into a slop tank and allowed to separate by their different densities into oil and water during the journey. The water portion was then discharged, leaving only crude oil in the slop tank. This was pumped into the main tanks and the new cargo loaded on top of it, recovering as much as 800 tons of oil which was formerly discarded. History Even with load on top there is still some oil in the discharged water from the slop tank. Starting in the 1970s, equipment capable of using crude oil itself for washing began to replace the water-based washing, leading to the current technique of crude oil washing. This reduces the remaining deliberate discharge of oil-contaminated water and increases the amount of cargo discharged, providing a further benefit to the cargo owner. Crude oil washing equipment became mandatory for new tankers of 20,000 tons or more deadweight with the 1978 Protocol to the 1973 MARPOL Convention. Revised specifications for the equipment were introduced in 1999. Modern tankers also use segregated ballast tanks and these remove the problem of discharge of oily ballast water.

The company was founded in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1977 by Jack Fulk and Richard Thomas. History Logo used until 2020 Bojangles' opened its first location in Charlotte in 1977. The following year, the first franchised restaurant began operations. Jack Fulk sold the Bojangles' concept to the now-defunct Horn & Hardart Company of New York in 1981. Bojangles' received fame in 1989 because their restaurants remained open when Hurricane Hugo struck the Carolinas while a majority of other fast-food restaurants had closed.https://web.archive.org/web/20170116224300/https://www.bojangles.com/about- us/history During the time of Horn and Hardart's ownership, the chain grew rapidly and expanded to 335 restaurants including 100 restaurants in Florida. Part of this growth was fueled by acquisitions including the Florida-based Biscuits chain. In 1990, Horn and Hardart sold most of its interest to Sienna Partners and Interwest Partners. The company was then headed by former KFC executive, Dick Campbell. In 1994 the company attempted a public offering. Campbell was subsequently replaced by CEO Jim Peterson. The company was sold to a group of investors headed by former Wendy's executive Joe Drury and financed by FMAC in 1998. Bojangles' expanded throughout the 1990s and 2000s, with the 300th location opening in 2003. The restaurant started its first college campus location on the grounds of Central Piedmont Community College in 2005. The company also purchased naming rights to the original Charlotte Coliseum on Independence Boulevard in Charlotte. Bojangles' was purchased again in 2007 by Falfurrias Capital Partners, a private equity firm. The first airport location was opened in 2008 at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport. In August 2011, Falfurrias sold Bojangles' to Boston-based Advent International, another private equity firm, after a competitive bidding process with other investors. Advertisement for Bojangles' at Durham Athletic Park in Durham, North Carolina (1989) In 2012, Bojangles' began sponsoring the NASCAR race Bojangles' Southern 500, and opened another college campus restaurant at UNC Greensboro. The company opened its 600th restaurant on July 8, 2014, on Galleria Road in Charlotte with Charlotte mayor Dan Clodfelter cutting the celebratory ribbon.Adams-Heard, Rachel. (July 9, 2014). Bojangles' reaches a milestone: 600 stores. The Charlotte Observer: retrieved July 9, 2014. In April 2015, the company filed with the US regulator for an initial public offering of its common stock, expecting to raise $372 million. In January 2019, Randy Kibler was replaced by Jose Armario as the Chief Executive Officer and brought with him Brian Unger, to serve as the Chief Operating Officer. Both individuals were past employees of McDonald's. On January 28, 2019, Bojangles' was acquired by the Jordan Company and Durational Capital Management (making Bojangles' a privately held company) with Bojangles' shareholders receiving $ 16.10 a share after their approval on January 14, 2019. In December 2019, Bojangles' and Love's Travel Stops & Country Stores came to an agreement to add 40 Bojangles' locations at Love's Travel Stops in Illinois, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Mississippi - all new states for Bojangles' - over the next ten years. At various times Bojangles' has franchised restaurants in Grand Cayman Island, Jamaica, Honduras, Mexico, Ireland, and China. Currently, U.S.-based restaurants are in 11 U.S. states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia) and the District of Columbia. Their home state of North Carolina has the largest number of locations. On August 3, 2020, the company released a statement stating it was dropping the apostrophe from it name.

A.A.E. Verhagen at the University of Groningen is an attorney and the medical director of the department of pediatrics at the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG). He is mainly known for his involvement in infant euthanasia in the Netherlands. Euthanasia is legal for patients over the age of 12 in the Netherlands. Verhagen, who studied both law and medicine, worked out a protocol with prosecutors and doctors in 2002 for infant euthanasia cases. This Groningen Protocol requires that the parents and teams of physicians and social workers agree that further treatment is futile. After a waiting period of several days, during which the parents can think over the decision and say goodbye, euthanasia is performed. The case records are subsequently turned over to the prosecutor's office. If this protocol is followed, prosecutors will refrain from pressing charges. In July 2005, this protocol was introduced nationwide in the Netherlands. In 2005, the New England Journal of Medicine published an article by Verhagen and his colleague Pieter Sauer outlining their protocol and documenting 22 cases of infant euthanasia that had been reported to the authorities between 1997 and 2004, with four of them occurring under Verhagen's supervision at his hospital. Verhagen and Sauer said the essay was intended to address \\"blood-chilling accounts and misunderstandings.\\" As his motive, Verhagen states that he believes euthanasia to be justified in cases of unbearable suffering, and that it is an important decision that should only happen as the result of an open and honest discussion among the involved parties, rather than as a lone decision of a doctor who is afraid of the consequences. However, the Groningen Protocol is extremely controversial. Among others, Dr Rob de Jong openly questions the criteria used in the Groningen protocol, especially \\"unbearable suffering\\" and the \\"expected quality of life\\" in a critical appraisal. Another important argument against the Groningen protocol is that the 22 cases described are all children with spina bifida, which is not considered a lethal disability. Erick Kodish has also harshly criticized the protocol and its premises in an article published in The Lancet where he has concluded inviting to resistance by means of civil disobedience against the medical institutionalization of infanticide.

It has a heavy build and possesses great endurance and hardiness. The breed is also referred to as the Carpathian pony, Huculska, Hutsul, Hu»õul, Hu»õan or Huzul. The breed gets its name from the Hutsul people, who live mostly in the Carpathians in Ukraine and in Romania, but also in an area in the East Carpathian Mountains north of the river Bistritz, officially named ‚ÄúHuzelei‚Äù. Characteristics Hucul ponies are usually calm with a good disposition, and are used for both hacking and pulling timber in otherwise inaccessible forested areas. They are usually bay, black, chestnut, or the grullo variation of dun, with a dorsal stripe and zebra stripes on the legs characteristic of the breed. Their conformation traits include a short head with a relatively short neck, compact body, short legs, and sound feet. hucul horse History The Hucul bears some resemblance to the now-extinct Tarpan. Said to have originated in the Carpathian Mountain range of Eastern Europe covered by present-day Ukraine, Poland, Slovakia and Romania,Hucul or Carpathian Pony it is named after the small sub-ethnic Ukrainian group of Hutsuls. However, the horse breed is much older than the Hutsul people. The Huculs are probably depicted on the monuments erected by Roman Emperors Domitian and Trajan, as Dacian draft horses. The breed was mentioned for the first time in written resources around 400 years ago (as the \\"Mountain Tarpan\\"). Unlike the Polish Konik, the Hucul has been only rarely cross-bred with domestic horses. Hucul horses in the Ukrainian mountains In the 19th century, the Huculs were used by the Austro-Hungarian Army. A Hucul pony in a natural state A Regional Championship of Hucul Horse in Rudawka Rymanowska In 1856, the first stud farm was established at RƒÉdƒÉu≈£i, Romania. Several bloodlines were established by the foundation stallions Goral, Hroby, Ou≈üor, Pietrousu and Prislop, and the horses were carefully bred to preserve the purity of these bloodlines. In 1922, thirty-three horses were sent to Czechoslovakia to establish a herd there which would become the Gurgul line. World War II caused a severe decline in the number of Hucul horses in Czechoslovakia. After the end of the war, only 300 Hucul horses remained there. Even though a stud-book was established in 1924 in the Huzelei after Michal Holl√§nder encouraged it, it was not until the early 1970s that breeders established an organization, Hucul Club, to prevent the extinction there caused by the declining number. In 1982 they established a stud book with fifty purebred animals and the goal of increasing the numbers in that region. Thanks to the efforts of breeders, the world population of these horses now exceeds 1,000. Most of them live in Poland, Slovakia, Romania, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine. Many ponies in Europe also have Hucul blood. In recent years the popularity of this breed has spread as far as England. In Vinnytsia oblast of Ukraine, a hucul stud farm was established by Gennady Romanenko in 2016.

The film is based on the 1923 memoir Dersu Uzala (which took its name from the native trapper) by Russian explorer Vladimir Arsenyev, about his exploration of the Sikhote-Alin region of the Russian Far East over the course of multiple expeditions in the early 20th century. Shot almost entirely outdoors in the Russian Far East wilderness, the film explores the theme of a native of the forests who is fully integrated into his environment, leading a style of life that will inevitably be destroyed by the advance of civilization. It is also about the growth of respect and deep friendship between two men of profoundly different backgrounds, and about the difficulty of coping with the loss of strength and ability that comes with old age. The film won the 1976 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, the Golden Prize and the Prix FIPRESCI at the 9th Moscow International Film Festival and a number of other awards. It sold 20.4 million tickets in the Soviet Union and made $1.2 million in the US and Canada. Plot The film opens to a forest that is being cleared for development, and Arsenyev searching for an unmarked grave of a friend he says he buried 3 years ago. The film then flashes back to Arsenyev's surveying expedition to the area of Shkotovo in Ussuri region in 1902. A topographic expedition troop, led by Captain Arsenyev (Yury Solomin), encounters a nomadic Goldi hunter named Dersu Uzala (Maxim Munzuk) who agrees to guide them through the harsh frontier. Initially viewed as an uneducated, eccentric old man, Dersu earns the respect of the soldiers through his great experience, accurate instincts, keen powers of observation, and deep compassion. He repairs an abandoned hut and leaves provisions in a birch container so that a future traveler would survive in the wilderness. He deduces the identities and situations of people by analyzing tracks and articles left behind. Dersu Uzala saves the life of Captain Arsenyev for the first time when the two are lost on a frozen lake and a sudden blizzard overtakes them. Dersu shows Arsenyev how to quickly build a straw hut for shelter using grass and then, when Arsenyev collapses due to exhaustion, Dersu pulls him into the shelter. The two men avoid freezing to death and are discovered by the rest of their comrades when the blizzard clears. The expedition then, struggling to survive the frozen tundra, encounter a Nani family who invite them into their home, providing the men much needed food, and warmth. At this point Dersu asks where Arsenyev will go next to which Arsenyev tells him \\"back to the city\\" and invites Dersu to come with him. Dersu tells him that his place is in the forest and that tomorrow he will go on his way. The next day he leaves the soldiers by the railroad tracks and returns to wilderness. Five years later in 1907, Arsenyev is on another expedition in Ussuri. He has been mapping mountain ranges for months, all the time holding onto hope that he will run into his old friend Dersu. One night, when at camp, one of his men says they ran into an old Hunter in the forest who was asking about their unit. Instantly hopeful, Arsenyev demands to know where he saw the man and rushes into the forest filled with hope of seeing his old friend. Searching the forest for a few minutes he sees Dersu walking away further into the forest. Calling for him he is overcome with joy as Dersu yells back and then men run to each other. The men embrace and Arsenyev brings Dersu back to camp with him where the two sit by a fire and talk about their time apart. Dersu takes up the job of expedition guide again. The expedition breaks up as Arsenyev, Dersu, and a few men cross a large river by raft, and the rest continue on to try to find a ford to cross with the horses. Arsenyev and Dersu get caught on the raft as the others embark and are quickly rushed downstream. Dersu saves Arsenyevs' life again by pushing him off the raft and telling him to swim toward shore. Dersu is trapped on the raft as conditions on the river become treacherous. Moments before Dersu and the raft crash into the rapids, Dersu jumps onto a branch in the middle of the river. He then directs the party to cut a tree which can reach him before he drowns. Some time passes and the men seem to be in good spirits. They take several pictures with Dersu and all seems to be going well. Arsenyev writes in his journal that some of his fondest memories of Dersu occurred during the beginning of that autumn. A short time later, the expedition party is trekking through the forest when Dersu realizes they are being stalked by a Siberian tiger. Dersu tries in vain to scare the Siberian tiger away telling him that the soldiers will shoot him with their guns. The tiger continues getting closer to Dersu and Arsenyev until Dersu is forced to shoot the tiger. Dersu is instantly distraught over shooting a tiger stating that Kanga, who is a forest spirit that his people worship, will be unhappy and will send another tiger for him. Dersu becomes more and more irritable, yelling at members of the party and distancing himself from Arsenyev. Dersu's eyesight and other senses begin to fade with age until he is no longer able to hunt thus not being able to live alone in the forest. Captain Arsenyev decides to take Dersu with him to the city of Khabarovsk. Dersu quickly discovers that he is not permitted to chop wood or to build a hut and fireplace in the city park, nor is he allowed to shoot within the city limits. Despite his love for Arsenyev and Arsenyevs' family, Dersu realizes that his place is not in the city and asks Arsenyev if he can return to living in the hills. As a parting gift, Arsenyev gives him a new rifle. Some while later, Arsenyev receives a telegram informing him that the body of a Goldi has been found, with no identification on him save Arsenyev's calling card, and is requested to come identify the body. Arsenyev finds that it is indeed Dersu. The officer who found Dersu speculates that someone may have killed Dersu to obtain the new rifle that Arsenyev gave him. As the gravediggers finish their work, Arsenyev finds Dersu's walking stick nearby, and plants it in the ground beside the grave.

In 1971, Kurosawa attempted suicide during a bad period in his career, questioning his creative ability after the commercial failure of Dodes'ka-den the year before and the subsequent denial of funds for his productions by Japanese studios.Anderson, Joseph L.; Richie, Donald; The Japanese Film: Art and Industry, p.460 In 1972, Dodes'ka-den producer Yoichi Matsue and his assistant Teruyo Nogami were approached by the Soviet studio Mosfilm for an adaptation of the Russian memoir Dersu Uzala to be directed by Kurosawa. On January 1, 1973 Matsue signed the deal on the condition that Kurosawa receive full creative control over the film. Mosfilm wanted Kurosawa's frequent collaborator Toshiro Mifune to play Dersu, but Matsue convinced them otherwise as Mifune would not be attached to such a long production. Eventually Tuva actor Maxim Munzuk was cast.

It was among the largest species of West Indian rice rat, as big as a cat, and was one of the first Caribbean mammals to become extinct during the 20th century. It may have been aquatic, as it was known to escape into the sea when pursued by predators, but it never swam away from the island. It was common on Martinique until the end of the 19th century, when attempts were made to exterminate it because it was considered to be a pest in the island's coconut plantations. It was also hunted for food; however, due to a strong musky odor, cooking required people to singe off its hair, air out the body overnight and boil it in two batches of water. On 8 May 1902, the volcano Mount Pel√©e erupted, completely destroying the island's principal city of Saint-Pierre. It has been speculated that the rice rat became extinct then or during a later eruption in 1902, but predation by introduced mongooses is more likely to have been the primary cause of its extinction.

She made her debut in Mortal Kombat 3 as the mother of Princess Kitana and the unwilling Queen of the evil emperor Shao Kahn. Sindel is only a supporting character with few overall playable appearances in the games, but she still plays a relevant part in the series storyline, especially in Mortal Kombat 3 and the 2011 reboot of the series. AppearancesIn video games= Queen Sindel rules the otherworldly realm of Edenia alongside her daughter, Princess Kitana. Her storyline begins 10,000 years prior, when her kingdom lost ten consecutive Mortal Kombat tournaments and was invaded by the evil Outworld emperor Shao Kahn, resulting in a forceful merging of the two realms. Sindel was forced to witness her people's enslavement, her husband King Jerrod murdered, and their then-infant daughter Kitana adopted by the Kahn and raised as his own. This proved too much for her, as she committed suicide rather than become Shao Kahn's consort. However, during the events of Mortal Kombat 3, Shao Kahn resurrected her with the assistance of the sorcerer Shang Tsung in Earthrealm, which would allow the Kahn to invade Earthrealm without victory in Mortal Kombat while regaining his queen in the process. Sindel was successfully revived, but in a brainwashed state with no knowledge of her past so she would be completely loyal to Shao Kahn. He was only able to garner a partial merger of the realms following her revival however, before Raiden's chosen Earthrealm defenders defeated him. Additionally, Kitana‚Äîrealizing that her mother was alive‚Äîsucceeded in procuring an audience with her and convinced her of her true past, turning Sindel against the emperor. As Shao Kahn's defeat also allowed Edenia to regain its independence from Outworld, Sindel regained her rightful place on the throne and vowed not only to rebuild their home, but to also bring down Shao Kahn for his crimes. However, one of Sindel's subjects, Tanya, betrayed her homeland and allowed the fallen Elder God Shinnok's Netherrealm forces to invade her palace. Though Kitana escaped, Sindel was captured and imprisoned in her own dungeon until Shinnok's forces were defeated. Enraged at this latest invasion of her kingdom, Sindel sent Kitana to form an alliance with the Shokan armies and lead them into battle against a weakened Shao Kahn while she continued to help restore Edenia to its former beauty. However, Edenia was once again invaded, this time by the Dragon King, Onaga, who had killed and resurrected Kitana and her Earthrealm allies before placing them under his control. Sindel was once again confined to her own prisons, guarded by her own daughter until she was freed by Jade, allowing her to scour Edenia for more information on Onaga so she could free Kitana from his control. In Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, Sindel's non-canonical ending sees her defeating Blaze and obtaining godlike powers. With these newfound abilities, she resurrected her husband King Jerrod. Together with Kitana, they resolved to work together to ward off tyrants like Shao Kahn and keep the realms safe.Sindel's Armageddon info at Mortal Kombat Warehouse. In the rebooted timeline of Mortal Kombat (2011), Sindel's story follows that of the original timeline, though she is resurrected by Quan Chi instead of Shao Kahn. After receiving Shang Tsung's powers, she killed most of Earthrealm's warriors, Jade, and Kitana before Nightwolf sacrificed himself to kill her. Following this, Sindel was resurrected by Quan Chi as one of his undead revenants. In Mortal Kombat X, Sindel's revenant returned as a non- playable character, serving as one of Quan Chi and the fallen Elder God Shinnok's enforcers in the Netherrealm. She would take part in several battles on both of their behalves, only to be defeated. Sindel appears as a DLC character in Mortal Kombat 11, which drastically alters her history. In this timeline, the established story is a lie she told to appease her subjects. When Shao Kahn invaded Edenia, she personally murdered King Jerrod out of spite for his perceived weakness and willingly became the Kahn's wife to gain more power. Believing she was distracting Shao Kahn, Quan Chi killed Sindel and made it appear as if she committed suicide before using her soul to temporarily stop Shao Kahn from invading Earthrealm. In the DLC story expansion, Aftermath, Shang Tsung captured Sindel's revenant and revived her to help him capture Kronika's Crown of Souls. Sindel agreed and helped him while also reconsolidating her power with Shao Kahn before betraying Kitana and Earthrealm's forces. After helping Shang Tsung breach Kronika's keep however, the sorcerer in turn betrayed Sindel and Shao Kahn; absorbing their souls in retaliation for killing him to empower Sindel. Design and gameplay Lia Montelongo in 2017 During production of Mortal Kombat 3, Sindel was nicknamed \\"The Bride\\" and \\"Muchacha\\" by the developers before her official name was determined; John Tobias described her as \\"probably one of the coolest characters.\\"Video Games The Ultimate Gaming Magazine 75 (April 1995) page 48. She was played by actress Lia Montelongo (additionally Sareena in Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and the motion capture for Tanya in Mortal Kombat 4, both released in 1997), who was nineteen years old when she auditioned for the role. The process of applying her makeup and heavy wig took three hours, while her costume was red like those of the game's other characters, but digitally tinted purple for the game. Montelongo filmed game footage in a single fourteen-hour session, and in a 2001 interview with fan site Dave's Mortal Kombat, she revealed that after MK3's release, she would visit arcades to watch people play as Sindel.Lia Montelongo interview - Dave's Mortal Kombat, 2001. Retrieved March 11, 2015. Sindel's \\"that was fun\\" quote from her Friendship in MK3 was used in the second film. Sindel is the first character in the Mortal Kombat series who used the power of levitation as both a move used in combat and as a victory pose. She uses her screams as both stun moves and for some of her Fatalities. In the 2011 reboot, Sindel sported a similar but updated look resembling her MK3 appearance. She had no use of her hair as a weapon in Deception and Armageddon, but it returned in the reboot for both basic attacks and special moves. Prima Games considered Sindel well- balanced with a slight advantage over the game's other characters, while her \\"vast array of low attacks and multitude of projectiles and juggles bring her to the top of the food chain when it comes to the world of competitive Mortal Kombat.\\"Jason Wilson and Adam Hernandez. Mortal Kombat: Prima Official Game Guide (p. 242). Prima Games (2011), . =In other media and merchandise= In the 1995 one-shot issue comic book Sister Act, featuring Kitana and Mileena and published by Malibu Comics, Sindel has a minor appearance before Kahn's takeover of Edenia, and her hair therein is black, as opposed to the games' silver. Her fate after the invasion was ignored, with just Jerrod's death at the hands of Kahn and Shang Tsung shown. She had another brief role in a special-edition tie-in comic book that was included with the 1998 PC home release of Mortal Kombat 4, in which Quan Chi cons his way into Edenia by posing as a refugee from an annexed realm, and he offers Sindel a mysterious orb that she accepts, but it opens a portal through which Shinnok and his Netherealm denizens (including Reiko and Scorpion) emerge, and they capture Edenia. Musetta Vander as Sindel in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation In the 1997 film Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, Sindel had a supporting role and was portrayed by South African actress Musetta Vander. Her general backstory with Kitana was kept intact, and in subplots exclusive to the film, she is named the new general of Shao Kahn's extermination squads following the death of Rain, plus she works with Jade in luring the Earthrealmers into an ambush in Outworld, a task they fail and for which Jade is put to death. She uses all her MK3 special moves in the film, in separate attempts to defeat Raiden; for her \\"Hair Whip\\" maneuver, Vander's wig transformed into computer-generated razor-tipped braids that were rotoscoped onto her head. In the final battle at the film's climax, Sindel is defeated by Kitana, who elects to spare her life. After Kahn's death, Sindel is brought back to life with Kahn's curse over her broken. The film crew could not decide if the good Sindel should use another costume.. In the movie novelization by Jerome Preisler, Sindel pledges her Edenian kingdom to Liu Kang as a reward for his defeat of Kahn, but he respectfully refuses.Preisler, Jerome.

Retrieved March 14, 2015. Although Sindel was never seen nor mentioned by name in the 1998 television series Mortal Kombat: Konquest, her canon biography was acknowledged when Kitana declared that her mother had killed herself following the execution of King Jerrod, rather than be subservient to Kahn. Sindel's backstory at the time of Kahn's invasion of Edenia was again highlighted in the fourth episode of the 2011 first season of the Mortal Kombat: Legacy web series, at the beginning of a two-parter featuring Kitana and Mileena. She was played by Canadian actress Beatrice King (credited in the show as \\"Beatrice Ilg\\"), who had originally auditioned for Mileena before being cast as Sindel. King, who was familiar with the character from her brother having played the Mortal Kombat games, additionally \\"researched how she came about and her relationship\\" to King Jerrod. Though King has a background in kickboxing, she had no fight scenes in the episode, but she felt that \\"it was very important to show this regal quality about\\" the character, \\"and that sense of duty.\\" Sindel has featured very little in official Mortal Kombat merchandise.

In 2011, AlteredGamer ranked Sindel as seventh in their selection of the series' best characters. In The Gameological Society's 2012 ranking of video games' top \\"overbearing mother figures,\\" she placed twelfth. On the other UGO.com ranked Sindel 27th in their 2012 rating of Mortal Kombat characters, and she placed 29th in Den of Geek's 2015 ranking of the series' 73 playable characters, mainly for her slaughter of the Earthrealmers in the MK2011 story mode. Jon Hamlin of The Game Scouts ranked her seventh in his 2013 selection of the series' top characters. Her finishing moves have been fairly well received. GamePro included her \\"Killer Hair\\" from Mortal Kombat 3 among their top twelve \\"lamest\\" Fatalities, and ScrewAttack rated her \\"Swan Dive\\" Hara- Kiri from Mortal Kombat: Deception eighth in their 2011 selection of the top ten worst series finishers, but in 2010, Game Informer listed her \\"Scream\\" from MK3 as one of the series' best Fatalities, though they described Sindel herself as \\"campy.\\"Mortal Kombat's Best And Worst Fatalities, Game Informer, May 03, 2010 Prima Games ranked her \\"Migraine\\" Fatality from the 2011 reboot, in which she screams directly into her opponent's ear and causes their head to explode, 20th in their 2014 list of the series' top Fatalities.

Kexi can be used for designing and implementing databases, data inserting and processing, and performing queries. It is developed within the Calligra project but is released separately. The impetus for developing Kexi came from a noticeable lack of applications having the features of Microsoft Access, FoxPro, Oracle Forms or FileMaker while at the same time being powerful, inexpensive, open-standards-driven and sufficiently portable. Kexi 3.0 user interface Kexi works natively under Linux/Unix (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris) and Microsoft Windows operating systems. Older versions were available for Mac OS X (using Homebrew). macOS version was not released but can be compiled. Kexi application and its frameworks are available under the LGPL. User and developer documentation is available under the GFDL.  History  Kexi development started in 2002. OpenOffice Polskahttp://kde.org/support/thanks.php (archived version) (currently OpenOffice Software) contributed to it largely between 2003 and 2008. Although Kexi was a KOffice project since the beginning, the first release was independent of KOffice. The first public beta release of Kexi was version 0.1 beta 2 on . The first stable release was 0.9 ‚Äì made available on . A Kexi version with a lower version number ‚Äì 0.8 ‚Äì was shipped afterward with KOffice 1.4 on . Further stable versions of Kexi were released with KOffice 1.5 and 1.6 in 2006. From 2004 until 2007 OpenOffice Polska made commercial Kexi releases using release years as version numbers. The first release was Kexi 2004 LT on based on Kexi 0.1. The commercial releases concluded with Kexi 2007.1 in March 2007 based on Kexi 1.1.2/1.1.3. The porting process to KDE Platform 4 took rather long and was finished with the release of KOffice 2.2 in May 2010. Among its new features was a new Report Designer plug-in to replace the KOffice 1.6 stand-alone reporting application Kugar. Kexi 2.3 was released with KOffice 2.3 on with ‚Äì among other features ‚Äì a reworked Project Navigator pane. After the KOffice 2.3 release, Kexi moved into Calligra Suite and both were released as version 2.4 on . The most user-visible change was a redone main user interface dubbed Modern Menu. Since version 3.1 Kexi again officially supports Microsoft Windows.  Features  Kexi users can choose from various database engines that can be utilized for data and design storage. By default built-in SQLite 3 database engine is used that eliminates a need for installation and maintenance of a database server. For more advanced use Kexi can use database servers such as MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase. Database servers have to be accessible to user on the same or any other computer. All database objects ‚Äì tables, queries, forms, etc. ‚Äì are stored in tables of a single database (either file or server), making it easy to share data and design. Resulting database can be to certain extent manipulated using dedicated database tools. In Kexi, such data and definition of objects is known as project. Kexi Table designer allows users to design tables, which can then be created and opened for data entry, sorting and searching. Standard data types are available common to supported database engines. Among them is \\"Object\\" data type allowing to store images of many types. Queries can be designed visually or in built-in dedicated SQL editor, then they can be executed. There is support for parametrized queries and searching through the data. The scope of the SQL supported is limited compared to raw database engines (MySQL and even SQLite) but the SQL dialect supported by Kexi is (by design) common to all supported database engines. This can simplify switching between engines. Forms can be created to provide a custom interface to data. There is a designer, and a previewer capable of data entry. Wide range of graphical elements can be used including web browser and world map viewer. Simple actions can be assigned to form buttons. Kexi 2.2 ‚Äì the first release of the second generation ‚Äì introduced full-featured report designer, generator and previewer. Simple formulas can be assigned to report elements. The application can also import data (tables) from external data sources (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Access files, dBASE files) and export data to MySQL or PostgreSQL servers. There is rich support for importing and exporting CSV files. The same CSV format can be used for copying and pasting clipboard data so the data can be easily transferred to/from applications like spreadsheets or word processors. In a special User Mode Kexi allows users to switch off all commands related to editing project's design.  Experimental features  Kexi offered experimental scripting support using Python and Ruby in version 2. Scripting since version 3 is planned to be based on JavaScript. Handling Oracle databases was available in versions 1.x but is disabled in versions 2.x.

Mills (March 30, 1928 ‚Äì June 4, 2004) was a politician in Ontario, Canada. He served as a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 1995 who represented the eastern Ontario riding of Durham East. Background Mills was born in Brighton, England. He worked on a farm and cared for his aging parents. After they died in 1957 he relocated to Canada with his wife Cecilia and their two children. Upon arrival in Canada, he joined the army and served for 21 years and was posted to bases in Canada and Europe. During his time in the military he worked as an intelligence officer and military policeman. He received a General Service Medal from NATO (1964‚Äì67), a Canadian Forces Decoration (1970), and a United Nations medal (1971). After he left the army he worked as a tax auditor for the Ontario government. He had just retired from that job when he accepted the nomination as the New Democratic Party candidate in Durham East. Politics From 1976 to 1982, Mills was an alderman in the city of Barrie and also served as deputy mayor. In the provincial election of 1990 he was elected, defeating Progressive Conservative Kirk Kemp. The initial count was 10,930 to 10,922 votes so Kemp requested a recount. The recount increased the spread to 53 votes. The NDP won a majority government in this election and he was appointed as the parliamentary assistant to the Solicitor-General. As one of the oldest members of the NDP caucus, he was a strong advocate for pension benefits and for including the residents of land-lease communities (many of whom are seniors) under the Landlord and Tenants Act. In 1994, he came out against the proposed Bill 167, a bill that would have extended spousal benefits to same- sex couples. He said, \\"Every time you walk down the street people would say 'there goes that guy that supports the queer people.'\\" He apologized for the remark and while there were calls for him to be removed from caucus he remained unrepentant. He said, \\"My life doesn't depend on being at Queen's Park, nor do I need the wages or anything. I don't have to be here... all it will mean is I pay less income tax.\\" Premier Bob Rae allowed a free vote on the bill. He was one of 12 NDP members who voted against the legislation. The bill failed on a vote of 59 to 68. The NDP were defeated in the 1995 provincial election. Mills was defeated in Durham East, finishing second against Progressive Conservative John O'Toole. Later life Mills died in 2004. Jim Bradley, John O'Toole and Peter Kormos paid tribute to him in the legislature.

It was one of two species of rat native to Christmas Island, alongside the Bulldog rat. Abundant, unfamiliar with and seemingly unafraid of humans, large numbers of the creatures emerged and foraged in all directions at night. Making querulous squeaks, the rats entered the Challenger Expedition's tents and shelters in 1886, ran over sleepers, and upset everything in the search and fight for food. Maclear's rat might have been responsible for keeping the population of the Christmas Island red crab in check, as recent numbers of the crab are greater than in the past. It is thought that black rats inadvertently introduced by the expedition infected the Maclear's rats with a disease (possibly a trypanosome), which in turn could have contributed to the species decline. The last recorded sighting was in 1903, although it is possible that Maclear's rats formed hybrids with black rats. A hard tick, Ixodes nitens, described as an ectoparasite of Maclear's rat is also thought to be extinct. Skull Said to be related to Rattus xanthurus of Sulawesi and R. everetti of the Philippines, this species was grizzled brown above and lighter on the underside. The lower back had prominent long and black hairs that projected above the shorter fur. The base of the tail was dark with the distal half being scaly white. Extinction timeline for Christmas Island rats The rat is named after Captain John Maclear (1838‚Äì1907) of the British survey-ship HMS Flying-fish who collected the specimen from Christmas Island in 1886. It was described as a new species by Oldfield Thomas the next year although it was originally described under the genus Mus. Maclear was earlier commander on HMS Challenger for the Challenger Expedition of 1872‚Äì1876 under its commission captain, Sir George Nares. A DNA study found Maclear's rat to be the sister species of Hainald's rat, with the clade containing the two being sister to the clade containing Nesokia and Bandicota, this clade in turn is sister to the Australasian Rattus radiation, making Rattus as currently defined paraphyletic.

He is the lead singer and bassist for the stoner metal band Sleep. He is also the singer and bassist in the rhythm heavy drone band Om. He was a member of Shrinebuilder and Asbestosdeath (the precursor to Sleep) and has put out six releases as a solo artist. On April 20, 2019, Rickenbacker Guitars announced the release of a limited edition Al Cisneros signature bass guitar, Rickenbacker model number 4003AC.  Music career  Cisneros' earliest musical interests included an appreciation of Black Sabbath, in particular their first four albums. In 1989 he formed the sludge metal band Asbestosdeath, taking up bass and vocal duties, with Chris Hakius on drums and Matt Pike and Tom Choi on guitar. Asbestosdeath released two EPs in 1990. =Sleep= Following Choi's departure, Cisneros, Hakius and Pike recruited Justin Marler on guitar and renamed themselves Sleep. Cisneros jokingly called himself \\"Luke\\" in the early days of Sleep, in homage to \\"Luke's Wall\\", the title of the outro section of \\"War Pigs\\".War Pigs In 1991 Sleep released their first album, Volume One. They soon gained a devoted underground following in the doom metal scene. In 1992 they released their next album, Sleep's Holy Mountain an influential album in the early development of stoner metal. Between 1995 and 1998, Sleep worked extensively on their next album, Dopesmoker, a single song lasting one hour. However, their record label at the time refused to release it, and in 1998 Sleep disbanded. An abridged form was released in 1999 under the title Jerusalem. Dopesmoker in its entirety was first officially released by Tee Pee Records on April 22, 2003. On November 26, 2012, it was reported that Sleep had recently announced their own status as a \\"full, reunited band\\". = OM = In 2003, Cisneros and Hakius decided to form their own band named OM, with Cisneros on bass and vocals and Hakius on drums. As a duo OM released the albums Variations on a Theme in 2005, Conference of the Birds in 2006, and Pilgrimage in 2007. In January 2008, Hakius decided to leave the band and was replaced by Emil Amos on drums. Since then, OM has released the two full-length studio albums God is Good and Advaitic Songs on the Drag City label, a 7\\" for Sub Pop entitled Gebel Barkal, and the live vinyl-only LP Conference Live on Important Records. OM's 2012 tour for the Advaitic Songs album included Robert Lowe on backing vocals, guitar, synthesizer and tambura. Lowe had previously appeared on vocals and tambura on God Is Good. =Solo= In December 2012 Cisneros released his first solo record Dismas on the band's own Sinai imprint, following the religious tones themed in OM but with more of a dub approach.

Control panel is at top center, to the left of the memory drum. The LGP-30, standing for Librascope General Purpose and then Librascope General Precision, was an early off-the-shelf computer. It was manufactured by the Librascope company of Glendale, California (a division of General Precision Inc.), and sold and serviced by the Royal Precision Electronic Computer Company, a joint venture with the Royal McBee division of the Royal Typewriter Company. The LGP-30 was first manufactured in 1956, at a retail price of $47,000, . The LGP-30 was commonly referred to as a desk computer. Its height, width, and depth, excluding the typewriter shelf, was . It weighed about , and was mounted on sturdy casters which facilitated moving the unit.  Design  The LGP-30 control panel. The primary design consultant for the Librascope computer was Stan Frankel, a Manhattan Project veteran and one of the first programmers of ENIAC. He designed a usable computer with a minimal amount of hardware. The single address instruction set had only 16 commands. Magnetic drum memory held the main memory, and the central processing unit (CPU) processor registers, timing information, and the master bit clock, each on a dedicated track. The number of vacuum tubes were kept to a minimum by using solid-state diode logic, a bit-serial architecture and multiple use of each of the 15 flip-flops. It was a binary, 31-bit word computer with a 4096-word drum memory. Standard inputs were the Flexowriter keyboard and paper tape (ten six-bit characters/second). The only printing output was the Flexowriter printer (typewriter, working at 10 characters/second). An optional higher-speed paper tape reader and punch was available as a separate peripheral. Console typewriter of an LGP-30 at the Computer History Museum. Note that, as was common in typewriters of the time, there is no key for the number 1 (lower case L was used instead). The computer contained 113 electronic tubes and 1450 diodes. The 113 electronic tubes were mounted on 34 etched circuit pluggable cards which also contain associated components. Although 34 pluggable cards were used, there were only 12 different types of such cards. Card-extenders were available to permit dynamic testing of all machine functions. 680 of the 1450 diodes were mounted on one pluggable logic board. The LGP-30 required 1500 watts when operating under full load. The power inlet cord was plugged into any standard 115 volt 60-cycle single-phase line. The computer contained internal voltage regulation against power-line variations of voltages from 95 to 130 volts. In addition to regulation of power-line variations, the computer also contained the circuitry required to permit a warm-up stage. This warm-up stage minimized thermal shock to tubes to ensure long component life. The computer contained its own blower unit and directed filtered air, through ducts, to tubes and diodes, in order to ensure component life and proper operation. No expensive air conditioning needed to be installed if operated within a reasonable temperature range. There were 32 bit locations per drum word, but only 31 were used, permitting a \\"restoration of magnetic flux in the head\\" at the 32nd bit time. Since there was only one address per instruction, a method was needed to optimize allocation of operands. Otherwise, each instruction would wait a complete drum (or disk) revolution each time a data reference was made. The LGP-30 provided for operand-location optimization by interleaving the logical addresses on the drum so that two adjacent addresses (e.g., 00 and 01) were separated by nine physical locations. These spaces allowed for operands to be located next to the instructions which use them. There were 64 tracks, each with 64 words (sectors). The time between two adjacent physical words was about 0.260 millisecond (ms), and the time between two adjacent addresses was 9 x 0.260 or 2.340 ms. The worst-case access time was 16.66 ms. Half of the instruction (15 bits) was unused. The unused half could have been used for extra instructions, indexing, indirect addressing, or a second (+1) address to locate the next instruction, each of which would have increased program performance. None of these features were implemented in the LGP-30, but some were realized in its 1960 successor, the RPC-4000. The LGP-30 register display, which used an oscilloscope behind this mask. A truly unique feature of the LGP-30 was the way it handled multiplication. Despite the LGP-30 being inexpensive, it had built-in multiplication. Since this was a drum computer and bits needed to be acted on serially as they were read from the drum, as it did each of the additions involved in the multiplication, it effectively shifted the operand right, acting as if the binary point were on the left side of the word, as opposed to the right side as most other computers assume. The divide operation worked similarly. It also had an integer multiplication but, because the accumulator had 32 bits while memory words had only 31 bits, only even integers could be thus represented. To further reduce costs, the traditional front panel lights showing internal registers were absent. Instead, Librascope mounted a small oscilloscope on the front panel. It displayed the output from the three register read heads, one above the other, allowing the operator to \\"see\\" and actually read the bits. Horizontal and vertical size controls let the operator adjust the display to match a plastic overlay engraved with the bit numbers. To read bits the operator counted the up- and down-transitions of the oscilloscope trace. Unlike other machines of its day, internal data was represented in hexadecimal as opposed to octal, but being a very inexpensive machine it used the physical typewriter keys that correspond to positions 10 to 15 in the type basket for the six non-decimal characters (as opposed to the current practice of A ‚Äì F) to represent those values, resulting in 0 ‚Äì 9 f g j k q w, which was remembered using the phrase \\"FiberGlass Javelins Kill Quite Well\\".

The LGP-30 was quite popular with \\"half a thousand\\" units sold, including one at Dartmouth College where students implemented Dartmouth ALGOL 30 and DOPE (Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment) on the machine. ACT-III programming language The LGP-30 had a high-level language called ACT-III. Every token had to be delimited by an apostrophe, making it hard to read and even harder to prepare tapes: s1'dim'a'500'm'500'q'500'' index'j'j+1'j-1'' daprt'e'n't'e'r' 'd'a't'acr rdxit's35'' s2'iread'm'1iread'q'1iread'diread'n 1';'j'' 0'flo'd';'d.'' s3'sqrt'd.';'sqrd.'' 1'unflo'sqrd.'i/'10';'sqrd'' 2010'print'sqrd.2000'iprt'sqrdcrcr ... ALGOL 30 Dartmouth College developed two implementations of ALGOL 60 for the LGP-30. Dartmouth ALGOL 30 was a three-pass system (compiler, loader, and interpreter) that provided almost all features of ALGOL except those requiring run-time storage allocation. SCALP, a Self Contained Algol Processor, was a one-pass system for a small subset of ALGOL (no blocks other than the entire program), no procedure declarations, conditional statements but no conditional expressions, no constructs other than \`while\` in a \`for\` statement, no nested \`switch\` declarations (nested calls are permitted), and no boolean variables and operators. As in ACT-III, every token had to be separated by an apostrophe. Starting the machine The procedure for starting, or \\"booting\\" the LGP-30 was one of the most complicated ever devised. First, the bootstrap paper tape was snapped into the console typewriter, a Friden Flexowriter. The operator pressed a lever on the Flexowriter to read an address field and pressed a button on the front panel to transfer the address into a computer register. Then the lever on the Flexowriter was pressed to read the data field and three more buttons were pressed on the front panel to store it at the specified address. This process was repeated, maybe six to eight times, and a rhythm was developed: burrrp, clunk, burrrp, clunk, clunk, clunk, burrrp, clunk, burrrp, clunk, clunk, clunk, burrrp, clunk, burrrp, clunk, clunk, clunk, burrrp, clunk, burrrp, clunk, clunk, clunk, burrrp, clunk, burrrp, clunk, clunk, clunk, burrrp, clunk, burrrp, clunk, clunk, clunk. The operator then removed the bootstrap tape, snapped in the tape containing the regular loader, carefully arranging it so it would not jam, and pressed a few more buttons to start up the bootstrap program. Once the regular loader was in, the computer was ready to read in a program tape. The regular loader read a more compact format tape than the bootstrap loader. Each block began with a starting address so the tape could be rewound and retried if an error occurred. If any mistakes were made in the process, or if the program crashed and damaged the loader program, the process had to be restarted from the beginning. LGP-21 In 1963, Librascope produced a transistorized update to the LGP-30 named the LGP-21.Picture with description of computer parts: The new computer had about 460 transistors and about 375 diodes.

His discovery that massive differences in forecast could derive from tiny differences in initial data led to him coining the terms strange attractor and butterfly effect, core concepts in chaos theory.

It is currently released quarterly. The publication is printed and edited by union labor, and is frequently distributed at radical bookstores, demonstrations, strikes and labor rallies. It covers industrial conditions, strikes, workplace organizing experiences, and features on labor history. It used to be released as a newspaper. Famous 1911 Industrial Worker illustration, \\"Pyramid of Capitalist System\\" The newspaper was first printed in journal format in Joliet, Illinois, beginning in January 1906, incorporating \\"The Voice of Labor,\\" the newspaper from the former American Labor Union which had joined the IWW, and \\"International Metal Worker.\\" It was edited by A. S. Edwards, and early contributors include Eugene V. Debs, Jack London, Daniel DeLeon, Bill Haywood, and James H. Walsh, along with poetry by Covington Hall. When the group led by ousted President Charles O. Sherman retained physical control over the paper after the union's 1906 Convention, and continued publication under that name for a few months (before giving up the ghost), the IWW instead issued the Industrial Union Bulletin for several years. A.S. Edwards was elected editor of the Bulletin in 1906.Paul Frederick Brissenden, The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, page 176 The second series of the Industrial Worker commenced in 1909 in Spokane, Washington, and has continued to this day, with only one major interruption, during the period of 1913-1916. In the early years, it was printed weekly and mainly circulated west of the Mississippi, while the IWW's \\"Official Eastern Organ\\" was Solidarity published in New Castle, Pennsylvania and later, Cleveland, which continued until it merged with the Industrial Worker in Chicago in the 1930s. The Spokane paper was the birthplace of the comic strip character Mr. Block, later commemorated in a Joe Hill song. The Industrial Worker usually ran four pages, with an annual eight page May Day issue reflecting on gains of the labor movement in the previous year. Circulation fell off due to the repression of the IWW during and after the First World War, reflecting a decline in the influence of radical unionism more generally. The position of IW editor is decided every two years via IWW referendum. Recent editors have included Jon Bekken, Peter Moore, Diane Krauthamer, and Roberta McNair. Currently, the publication is edited by a committee. IWW members and working class folks are encouraged to submit articles for publication. Issues of the Industrial Worker are often available on microfilm at university libraries and other research oriented facilities, and they contain a wealth of information on world view of the wobblies over the past century.

It was one of two rats endemic to Christmas Island, alongside Maclear's rat.  Description  The head and body length was about 25‚Äì27 cm, considerably larger than black rats, and their backs were covered in a two centimetre thick layer of fat. They have been estimated to weigh 250-300 g. They had short, thick tails estimated to be around 17.5 cm long. Their hair was described as being thick and coarse and dark reddish brown in colour, with a slightly lighter underside. Despite traditionally thought to be a part of the genus Rattus, the bulldog rat is now thought to be nested within Bunomys, a genus otherwise endemic to Sulawesi and surrounding islands.  Life history  The rats lived on the higher hills and denser forests of the island. They lived in small colonies, in burrows among the roots of trees or under hollow logs of sago palms in primary forest. They were sluggish, never climbed. Bulldog rats have been suggested to have been half-dazed in daylight, and were strictly nocturnal.  Extinction  The last record dates from 1903. They are suggested to have succumbed to a disease brought by black rats that had been inadvertently introduced by sailors, as mass die offs are noted around 1902-1903, after which it was never seen again.

Founded in 1733, it is one of the UK's largest teaching hospitals and one of the largest hospitals in Europe. It is run by the St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. It shares its main hospital site in Tooting in the London Borough of Wandsworth, with St George's, University of London which trains NHS staff and carries out advanced medical research. The hospital has around 1,300 beds and most general tertiary care such as accident and emergency, maternity services and care for older people and children. However, as a major acute hospital, St George's Hospital also offers specialist care for the more complex injuries and illnesses, including trauma, neurology, cardiac care, renal transplantation, cancer care and stroke. It is also home to one of four major trauma centres and one of eight hyper-acute stroke units for London. St George's Hospital also provides care for patients from a larger catchment area in the South East of England, for specialities such as complex pelvic trauma. Other services treat patients from all over the country, such as family HIV care and bone marrow transplantation for non-cancer diseases. The trust also provides a nationwide endoscopy training service.  History Early history= Following a disagreement between medical staff and the Board of Governors over the expansion of the Westminster Infirmary, a mass exodus of medical staff left, in 1733, to set up what became St George's Hospital. The Board of Governors had favoured a house in Castle Lane but the medical staff preferred Lanesborough House at Hyde Park Corner. Lanesborough House, originally built in 1719 by James Lane, 2nd Viscount Lanesborough,The London high life was at that time located in open countryside. The new St George's Hospital was arranged on three floors and accommodated 30 patients in two wards: one for men and one for women. The hospital was gradually extended and, by 1744, it had fifteen wards and over 250 patients.History of St George's Hospital Medical School St. George's Hospital, Hyde Park Corner By the 1800s, the hospital was slipping into disrepair. The old Lanesborough House at Hyde Park Corner was demolished to make way for a new 350 bed facility designed by architect William Wilkins. Building began in 1827 and was completed by 1844. By 1859, a critical shortage of beds led to the addition of an attic floor. This was soon insufficient and led to the creation of a new convalescent hospital, Atkinson Morley's in Wimbledon, freeing up beds at St George's for acute patients. A medical school was established in 1834 at Kinnerton Street and was incorporated into the hospital in 1868. The Medical School, now St George's, University of London, was built in the south-west corner of the hospital site in Hyde Park, with the main entrance in Knightsbridge and the back entrance in Grosvenor Crescent Mews. In 1948, the National Health Service was introduced and plans for a new site for St George's at The Grove Fever and Fountain Hospitals at Tooting were eventually agreed upon. In 1954, the Grove Hospital became part of St George's, and clinical teaching started in Tooting. =Relocation to Tooting= Hospital buildings in Tooting, 2015 In 1973, building began on the new site. The new hospital and school buildings were now well advanced. The School was completed, as were two wings of the new hospital, which provided a total of 710 beds. In 1976, the Medical School opened at Tooting and, in 1980, St George's Hospital at Hyde Park Corner closed its doors for the last time. (The building still stands and is now The Lanesborough Hotel on the west side of Hyde Park Corner.) In 1981, medical education in London was reorganised to recognise the movement of population away from the centre. There are now fewer, larger medical schools in London. The expansion of St George's, University of London (formerly St George's Hospital Medical School) has become part of this policy. In 2004, neuroscience services located at Atkinson Morley Hospital in Wimbledon moved to the brand new Atkinson Morley Wing on the main St George's site. This addition to the hospital now also houses cardiac and cardiothoracic services which have moved from the old fever hospital wards. St George's today provides a total of over 1,000 beds making it one of the biggest in the country. In April 2010 St George's Healthcare became part of the South West London and Surrey Trauma Network (SWLSTN). All Accident and Emergency (A&E;) departments within the network continue to provide trauma services with St George's designated as the major trauma centre. It is one of a small number of A&E; departments to benefit from Pearson Lloyd's redesign ‚Äì 'A Better A&E;' ‚Äì which reduced aggression against hospital staff by 50 per cent. A system of environmental signage provides location-specific information for patients. Screens provide live information about how many cases are being handled and the current status of the A&E; department. In October 2010 St George's Healthcare NHS Trust integrated with Community Services Wandsworth, after approval from NHS London. In May 2014 the Trust's application for Foundation Trust status was approved by the NHS Trust Development Authority following a positive rating from the Care Quality Commission. In the last five years the trust has turned around a large deficit and repaid a debt of ¬£34m. The TDA identified several areas that the trust will have to work on to ensure it gets through the final stages of FT assessment. These include improving its A&E; performance against the four- hour waiting time target and putting together a robust operating plan for the next two years. From October 2014 the hospital's Accident and Emergency department has featured in the Channel 4 documentary series \\"24 Hours in A&E;\\". In August 2018 it was reported that the average death rate nationally among patients receiving cardiac surgery was 2%, but that the cardiac unit at St George's had experienced 3.7%. Toxic disputes between surgeons were blamed. Mike Bewick wrote a report claiming \\"inadequate\\" internal scrutiny of the department; also the surgeons were divided into \\"two camps\\" showing \\"tribal- like activity\\". Bewick stated, \\"In our view the whole team shares responsibility for the failure to significantly improve professional relationships and to a degree surgical mortality.\\" The hospital maintained it was taking action.

When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured at 1 frame per second, but then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase. In a similar manner, film can also be played at a much lower rate than at which it was captured, slowing down an otherwise fast action, as in slow motion or high-speed photography. Processes that would normally appear subtle and slow to the human eye, e.g. the motion of the sun and stars in the sky or the growth of a plant, become very pronounced. Time-lapse is the extreme version of the cinematography technique of undercranking. Stop motion animation is a comparable technique; a subject that does not actually move, such as a puppet, can repeatedly be moved manually by a small distance and photographed. Then the photographs can be played back as a film at a speed that shows the subject appearing to move. History Some classic subjects of time-lapse photography include: * Landscapes and celestial motion * plants growing and flowers opening * fruit rotting and expiring * evolution of a construction project * people in the city The technique has been used to photograph crowds, traffic, and even television. The effect of photographing a subject that changes imperceptibly slowly, creates a smooth impression of motion. A subject that changes quickly is transformed into an onslaught of activity. The inception of time-lapse photography occurred in 1872 when Leland Stanford hired Eadweard Muybridge to prove whether or not race horses hooves ever are simultaneously in the air when running. The experiments progressed for 6 years until 1878 when Muybridge set up a series of cameras for every few feet of a track which had tripwires the horses triggered as they ran. The photos taken from the multiple cameras were then compiled into a collection of images that recorded the horses runninghttps://www.wingscapes.com/blog/from-peonies-to-the- projectcam-the-history-of-time-lapse-photography/ The first use of time-lapse photography in a feature film was in Georges M√©li√®s' motion picture Carrefour De L'Opera (1897). F. Percy Smith pioneered the use of time-lapse in nature photography with his 1910 silent film The Birth of a Flower. The first use of lapse-time to record the movement of flowers took place in Yosemite in late 1911‚Äì1912 by Arthur C. Pillsbury, who built a special camera for this purpose and recorded the movements of flowers through their life cycle. Pillsbury owned the Studio of the Three Arrows in the Valley and applied the technique to solving the problem of ensuring the survival of the rapidly shrinking varieties in the meadows. The United States Cavalry, then in charge of Yosemite, were mowing the meadows to produce fodder for their horses. Pillsbury showed his first film to Superintendents for the National Parks during a conference held for them in Yosemite from October 14‚Äì16, 1912. The result was a unanimous agreement by the Superintendents to cease cutting the meadows and begin preservation. Pillsbury made lapse-time movies for 500 of the 1,500 varieties of wildflowers in Yosemite over the next years. His films were shown during his lectures, which were scheduled first at garden clubs around California and then at most of the major universities across the country. Pillsbury also showed his films and lectured to town hall forums and the National Geographic Society. In 1926 he was asked to present both his lapse-time motion pictures and his newly invented microscopic film to President Calvin Coolidge at a dinner given on March 15 in the president's honor at the Willard Hotel in Washington, DC. Pillsbury had been invited to present the films by Secretary of the Interior Herbert Work. The use of photography in this form to obtain the preservation of natural resources was a first and followed his use of film to make the first recorded nature movie, shown to tourists in Yosemite in the spring of 1909. Time-lapse photography of biological phenomena was pioneered by Jean Comandon in collaboration with Path√© Fr√®res from 1909, by F. Percy Smith in 1910 and Roman Vishniac from 1915 to 1918. Time-lapse photography was further pioneered in the 1920s via a series of feature films called Bergfilme (Mountain films) by Arnold Fanck, including Das Wolkenph√§nomen in Maloja (1924) and The Holy Mountain (1926). From 1929 to 1931, R. R. Rife astonished journalists with early demonstrations of high magnification time-lapse cine-micrography but no filmmaker can be credited for popularizing time-lapse more than Dr. John Ott, whose life-work is documented in the DVD-film Exploring the Spectrum. Ott's initial \\"day-job\\" career was that of a banker, with time-lapse movie photography, mostly of plants, initially just a hobby. Starting in the 1930s, Ott bought and built more and more time-lapse equipment, eventually building a large greenhouse full of plants, cameras, and even self-built automated electric motion control systems for moving the cameras to follow the growth of plants as they developed. He time-lapsed his entire greenhouse of plants and cameras as they worked ‚Äì a virtual symphony of time-lapse movement. His work was featured on a late 1950s episode of the request TV show, You Asked For It. Ott discovered that the movement of plants could be manipulated by varying the amount of water the plants were given, and varying the color-temperature of the lights in the studio. Some colors caused the plants to flower, and other colors caused the plants to bear fruit. Ott discovered ways to change the sex of plants merely by varying the light source color-temperature. By using these techniques, Ott time-lapse animated plants \\"dancing\\" up and down in synch to pre-recorded music tracks. His cinematography of flowers blooming in such classic documentaries as Walt Disney's Secrets of Life (1956), pioneered the modern use of time-lapse on film and television. Ott wrote several books on the history of his time-lapse adventures, My Ivory Cellar (1958), Health and Light (1979), and the film documentary Exploring the Spectrum (DVD 2008). The Oxford Scientific Film Institute in Oxford, United Kingdom specializes in time-lapse and slow-motion systems, and has developed camera systems that can go into (and move through) small places. Their footage has appeared in TV documentaries and movies. PBS's NOVA series aired a full episode on time-lapse (and slow motion) photography and systems in 1981 titled Moving Still. Highlights of Oxford's work are slow-motion shots of a dog shaking water off himself, with close ups of drops knocking a bee off a flower, as well as time- lapse of the decay of a dead mouse. The first major usage of time-lapse in a feature film was Koyaanisqatsi (1983). The non-narrative film, directed by Godfrey Reggio, contained time-lapse of clouds, crowds, and cities filmed by cinematographer Ron Fricke. Years later, Ron Fricke produced a solo project called Chronos shot on IMAX cameras, which is still frequently played on Discovery HD. Fricke used the technique extensively in the documentary Baraka (1992) which he photographed on Todd-AO (70 mm) film. Recent films made entirely in time-lapse photography include Nate North's film, Silicon Valley Time-lapse, which is the first feature-length film shot almost entirely in three-frame high dynamic range, as well as artist Peter Bo Rappmund's three feature-length documentaries, Psychohydrography (2010), Tectonics (2012), and Topophilia (2015). Countless other films, commercials, TV shows and presentations have included time-lapse. For example, Peter Greenaway's film A Zed & Two Noughts featured a sub-plot involving time-lapse photography of decomposing animals and included a composition called \\"Time-lapse\\" written for the film by Michael Nyman. In the late 1990s, Adam Zoghlin's time-lapse cinematography was featured in the CBS television series Early Edition, depicting the adventures of a character that receives tomorrow's newspaper today. David Attenborough's 1995 series, The Private Life of Plants, also utilised the technique extensively. Terminology The frame rate of time- lapse movie photography can be varied to virtually any degree, from a rate approaching a normal frame rate (between 24 and 30 frames per second) to only one frame a day, a week, or longer, depending on subject. The term \\"time- lapse\\" can also apply to how long the shutter of the camera is open during the exposure of each frame of film (or video), and has also been applied to the use of long-shutter openings used in still photography in some older photography circles. In movies, both kinds of time-lapse can be used together, depending on the sophistication of the camera system being used. A night shot of stars moving as the Earth rotates requires both forms. A long exposure of each frame is necessary to enable the dim light of the stars to register on the film. Lapses in time between frames provide the rapid movement when the film is viewed at normal speed. As the frame rate of time-lapse approaches normal frame rates, these \\"mild\\" forms of time-lapse are sometimes referred to simply as fast motion or (in video) fast forward. This type of borderline time-lapse resembles a VCR in a fast forward (\\"scan\\") mode. A man riding a bicycle will display legs pumping furiously while he flashes through city streets at the speed of a racing car. Longer exposure rates for each frame can also produce blurs in the man's leg movements, heightening the illusion of speed. Two examples of both techniques are the running sequence in Terry Gilliam's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1989), in which a character outraces a speeding bullet, and Los Angeles animator Mike Jittlov's 1980s short and feature-length films, both titled The Wizard of Speed and Time. When used in motion pictures and on television, fast motion can serve one of several purposes. One popular usage is for comic effect. A slapstick comic scene might be played in fast motion with accompanying music. (This form of special effect was often used in silent film comedies in the early days of the cinema; see also liquid electricity). Another use of fast motion is to speed up slow segments of a TV program that would otherwise take up too much of the time allotted a TV show. This allows, for example, a slow scene in a house redecorating show of furniture being moved around (or replaced with other furniture) to be compressed in a smaller allotment of time while still allowing the viewer to see what took place. The opposite of fast motion is slow motion. Cinematographers refer to fast motion as undercranking since it was originally achieved by cranking a handcranked camera slower than normal. Overcranking produces slow motion effects. How time-lapse works Film is often projected at 24 frame/s, meaning 24 images appear on the screen every second. Under normal circumstances, a film camera will record images at 24 frame/s. Since the projection speed and the recording speed are the same. Even if the film camera is set to record at a slower speed, it will still be projected at 24 frame/s. Thus the image on screen will appear to move faster. 600px The change in speed of the onscreen image can be calculated by dividing the projection speed by the camera speed. : \\\\mathrm{perceived\\\\ speed} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{projection\\\\ frame\\\\ rate}}{\\\\mathrm{camera\\\\ frame\\\\ rate}}\\\\times\\\\mathrm{actual\\\\ speed} So a film recorded at 12 frames per second will appear to move twice as fast. Shooting at camera speeds between 8 and 22 frames per second usually falls into the undercranked fast motion category, with images shot at slower speeds more closely falling into the realm of time- lapse, although these distinctions of terminology have not been entirely established in all movie production circles. The same principles apply to video and other digital photography techniques. However, until very recently , video cameras have not been capable of recording at variable frame rates. Time-lapse can be achieved with some normal movie cameras by simply shooting individual frames manually. But greater accuracy in time-increments and consistency in exposure rates of successive frames are better achieved through a device that connects to the camera's shutter system (camera design permitting) called an intervalometer. The intervalometer regulates the motion of the camera according to a specific interval of time between frames. Today, many consumer grade digital cameras, including even some point-and-shoot cameras have hardware or software intervalometers available. Some intervalometers can be connected to motion control systems that move the camera on any number of axes as the time-lapse photography is achieved, creating tilts, pans, tracks, and trucking shots when the movie is played at normal frame rate. Ron Fricke is the primary developer of such systems, which can be seen in his short film Chronos (1985) and his feature films Baraka (1992, released to video in 2001) and Samsara (2011). Short and long exposure time-lapse Exposure time in frame interval As mentioned above, in addition to modifying the speed of the camera, it is important to consider the relationship between the frame interval and the exposure time. This relationship controls the amount of motion blur present in each frame and is, in principle, exactly the same as adjusting the shutter angle on a movie camera. This is known as \\"dragging the shutter\\". A film camera normally records images at 24 frames per second (fps). During each second, the film is actually exposed to light for roughly half the time. The rest of the time, it is hidden behind the shutter. Thus exposure time for motion picture film is normally calculated to be second (often rounded to second). Adjusting the shutter angle on a film camera (if its design allows), can add or reduce the amount of motion blur by changing the amount of time that the film frame is actually exposed to light. Blurring vs. exposure times In time-lapse photography, the camera records images at a specific slow interval such as one frame every thirty seconds ( fps). The shutter will be open for some portion of that time. In short exposure time-lapse the film is exposed to light for a normal exposure time over an abnormal frame interval. For example, the camera will be set up to expose a frame for second every 30 seconds. Such a setup will create the effect of an extremely tight shutter angle giving the resulting film a stop-motion animation quality. In long exposure time-lapse, the exposure time will approximate the effects of a normal shutter angle. Normally, this means the exposure time should be half of the frame interval. Thus a 30‚Äësecond frame interval should be accompanied by a 15‚Äësecond exposure time to simulate a normal shutter. The resulting film will appear smooth. The exposure time can be calculated based on the desired shutter angle effect and the frame interval with the equation: : \\\\mathrm{exposure\\\\ time} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{shutter\\\\ angle}}{360^\\\\circ}\\\\times\\\\mathrm{frame\\\\ interval} Long exposure time-lapse is less common because it is often difficult to properly expose film at such a long period, especially in daylight situations. A film frame that is exposed for 15 seconds will receive 750 times more light than its second counterpart. (Thus it will be more than 9 stops over normal exposure.) A scientific grade neutral density filter can be used to compensate for the over-exposure. Time-lapse camera movement Some of the most stunning time-lapse images are created by moving the camera during the shot. A time-lapse camera can be mounted to a moving car for example to create a notion of extreme speed. However, to achieve the effect of a simple tracking shot, it is necessary to use motion control to move the camera. A motion control rig can be set to dolly or pan the camera at a glacially slow pace. When the image is projected it could appear that the camera is moving at a normal speed while the world around it is in time lapse. This juxtaposition can greatly heighten the time-lapse illusion. The speed that the camera must move to create a perceived normal camera motion can be calculated by inverting the time-lapse equation: : \\\\mathrm{actual\\\\ speed} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{camera\\\\ frame\\\\ rate}}{\\\\mathrm{projection\\\\ frame\\\\ rate}}\\\\times\\\\mathrm{perceived\\\\ speed} Baraka was one of the first films to use this effect to its extreme. Director and cinematographer Ron Fricke designed his own motion control equipment that utilized stepper motors to pan, tilt and dolly the camera. The short film A Year Along the Abandoned Road shows a whole year passing by in Norway's B√∏rfjord at 50,000 times the normal speed in just 12 minutes. The camera was moved, manually, slightly each day, and so the film gives the viewer the impression of seamlessly travelling around the fjord as the year goes along, each day compressed into a few seconds. A panning time-lapse can be easily and inexpensively achieved by using a widely available equatorial telescope mount with a right ascension motor (*360 degree example using this method). Two axis pans can be achieved as well, with contemporary motorized telescope mounts. A variation of these are rigs that move the camera during exposures of each frame of film, blurring the entire image. Under controlled conditions, usually with computers carefully making the movements during and between each frame, some exciting blurred artistic and visual effects can be achieved, especially when the camera is mounted on a tracking system that enables its own movement through space. The most classic example of this is the \\"slit-scan\\" opening of the \\"stargate\\" sequence toward the end of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), created by Douglas Trumbull. =Related techniques= *Bullet time *Hyperlapse *Motion control photography *Long-exposure photography High-dynamic-range (HDR) time-lapse Time-lapse can be combined with techniques such as high-dynamic-range imaging. One method to achieve HDR involves bracketing for each frame. Three photographs are taken at separate exposure values (capturing the three in immediate succession) to produce a group of pictures for each frame representing the highlights, mid-tones, and shadows. The bracketed groups are consolidated into individual frames. Those frames are then sequenced into video. Day-to-night transitions Day-to- night transitions are among the most demanding scenes in time-lapse photography and the method used to deal with those transitions is commonly referred to as the \\"Holy Grail\\" technique. In a remote area not affected by light pollution the night sky is about ten million times darker than the sky on a sunny day, which is corresponding to 23 exposure values. In the analog age, blending techniques have been used in order to handle this difference: One shot has been taken in daytime and the other one in the night from exactly the same camera angle. True day-to-night transitions however, are a domain of the digital age. Today there are many ways to handle day-to-night transitions, such as automatic exposure and ISO, bulb ramping and several software solutions to operate the camera from a computer or smartphone.Der heilige Gral der Zeitraffer Kinematografie.

He became the second Chief Justice of the court, and the second-longest serving Chief Justice to date.  Life and career  Ritchie was born in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia to Thomas Ritchie and Elizabeth Wildman Johnstone. He graduated from the Pictou Academy and went to study law in Halifax in the office of his brother, John William Ritchie. He was called to the bar of Nova Scotia in 1837 but moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, and was called to the bar of that province the following year. In 1846 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick. In keeping with his pledge to resign if a fellow Liberal candidate failed to win a by-election, he gave up his seat in 1851, only to be re-elected three years later. In 1855 he left politics to accept an appointment to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and 10 years later he was named Chief Justice of New Brunswick. He was appointed to the newly established Supreme Court of Canada on September 30, 1875 and became its chief justice on January 11, 1879. He served on the Supreme Court for 17 years until he died on September 25, 1892. Ritchie was twice married. He was first married at Rothesay on September 21, 1843 to Martha Strang. She was the daughter of John Strang, a shipping merchant from St. Andrews. Martha Ritchie died in 1847. A son and a daughter were born to this marriage. Ritchie's second marriage was at Saint John, New Brunswick on May 5, 1856 to Grace Vernon Nicholson (1838‚Äì1911). She was the daughter of the late Captain Thomas L. Nicholson and his wife Amy (n√©e Vernon) and stepdaughter of Vice-Admiral William Fitzwilliam Owen, R.N. Seven sons and five daughters were born to this marriage.

It is found in humans and many animal species; it also can refer to an accumulation or nodule of mast cells that resembles a tumor. Mast cells originate from the bone marrow and are normally found throughout the connective tissue of the body as normal components of the immune system. As they release histamine, they are associated with allergic reactions. Mast cells also respond to tissue trauma. Mast cell granules contain histamine, heparin, platelet-activating factor, and other substances. Disseminated mastocytosis is rarely seen in young dogs and cats, while mast cell tumors are usually skin tumors in older dogs and cats. Although not always malignant, they do have the potential to be. Up to 25 percent of skin tumors in dogs are mast cell tumors, with a similar number in cats. Signs and symptomsHumans= When mastocytomas affect humans, they are typically found in skin. They usually occur as a single lesion on the trunk or wrist. Although it is rare, mastocytomas are sometimes found in the lung. It can also affect children.Garc√≠a Iglesias F, S√°nchez Garc√≠a AM, Garc√≠a Lara GM. Mastocitoma solitario. Rev Pediatr Aten Primaria. 2014;16:35-7 =Other animals= Mast cell tumors are known among veterinary oncologists as 'the great pretenders' because their appearance can be varied, from a wart-like nodule to a soft subcutaneous lump (similar on palpation to a benign lipoma) to an ulcerated skin mass. Most mast cell tumors are small, raised lumps on the skin. They may be hairless, ulcerated, or itchy. They are usually solitary, but in about six percent of cases, there are multiple mast cell tumors (especially in Boxers and Pugs). Manipulation of the tumor may result in redness and swelling from release of mast cell granules, also known as Darier's sign, and prolonged local hemorrhage. In rare cases, a highly malignant tumor is present, and signs may include loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and anemia. The presence of these signs usually indicates mastocytosis, which is the spread of mast cells throughout the body. Release of a large amount of histamine at one time can result in ulceration of the stomach and duodenum (present in up to 25 percent of cases) or disseminated intravascular coagulation. When metastasis does occur, it is usually to the liver, spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow. File:Mast cell tumor side.JPGMast cell tumor on the side of a dog File:Mast cell tumor inner thigh.JPGMast cell tumor on the inner thigh of a dog File:Mast cell tumor of the toe.JPGMast cell tumor of the paw Diagnosis A needle aspiration biopsy of the tumor will typically show a large number of mast cells. This is sufficient to make the diagnosis of a mast cell tumor, although poorly differentiated mast cells may have few granules and thus are difficult to identify. The granules of the mast cell stain blue to dark purple with a Romanowsky stain, and the cells are medium-sized. However, a surgical biopsy is required to find the grade of the tumor. The grade depends on how well the mast cells are differentiated, mitotic activity, location within the skin, invasiveness, and the presence of inflammation or necrosis. *Grade I ‚Äì well differentiated and mature cells with a low potential for metastasis *Grade II ‚Äì intermediately differentiated cells with potential for local invasion and moderate metastatic behavior *Grade III ‚Äì undifferentiated, immature cells with a high potential for metastasis However, there is a significant amount of discordance between veterinary pathologists in assigning grades to mast cell tumors due to imprecise criteria. The disease is also staged according to the WHO system: *Stage I - a single skin tumor with no spread to lymph nodes *Stage II - a single skin tumor with spread to lymph nodes in the surrounding area *Stage III - multiple skin tumors or a large tumor invading deep to the skin with or without lymph node involvement *Stage IV ‚Äì a tumor with metastasis to the spleen, liver, or bone marrow, or with the presence of mast cells in the blood X-rays, ultrasound, or lymph node, bone marrow, or organ biopsies may be necessary to stage the disease. Treatment and prognosis Removal of the mast cell tumor through surgery is the treatment of choice. Antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, are given prior to surgery to protect against the effects of histamine released from the tumor. Wide margins (two to three centimeters) are required because of the tendency for the tumor cells to be spread out around the tumor. If complete removal is not possible due to the size or location, additional treatment, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy, may be necessary. Prednisone is often used to shrink the remaining tumor portion. H2 blockers, such as cimetidine, protect against stomach damage from histamine. Vinblastine and CCNU are common chemotherapy agents used to treat mast cell tumors. Toceranib and masitinib, examples of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are used in the treatment of canine mast cell tumors. Both were recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) FDA NEWS RELEASE as dog-specific anticancer drugs. CBS News FDA Approves First-Ever Dog Cancer Drug Grade I or II mast cell tumors that can be completely removed have a good prognosis. One study showed about 23 percent of incompletely removed grade II tumors recurred locally. Any mast cell tumor found in the gastrointestinal tract, paw, or on the muzzle has a guarded prognosis. Previous beliefs that tumors in the groin or perineum carried a worse prognosis have been discounted. Tumors that have spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body have a poor prognosis. Any dog showing symptoms of mastocytosis or with a grade III tumor has a poor prognosis. Dogs of the Boxer breed have a better than average prognosis because of the relatively benign behavior of their mast cell tumors. Multiple tumors that are treated similarly to solitary tumors do not seem to have a worse prognosis. Mast cell tumors do not necessarily follow the histological prognosis. Further prognostic information can be provided by AgNOR stain of histological or cytological specimen. Even then, there is a risk of unpredictable behavior. Other animals Mast cell tumors are an uncommon occurrence in horses. They usually occur as benign, solitary masses on the skin of the head, neck, trunk, and legs. Mineralization of the tumor is common. In pigs and cattle, mast cell tumors are rare. They tend to be solitary and benign in pigs and multiple and malignant in cattle. Mast cell tumors are found in the skin of cattle most commonly, but these may be metastases from tumors of the viscera. Other sites in cattle include the spleen, muscle, gastrointestinal tract, omentum, and uterus. =Dogs= Mast cell tumors mainly occur in older adult dogs, but have been known to occur on rare occasions in puppies. The following breeds are commonly affected by mast cell tumors: *Boxer *Staffordshire bull terrier *Bulldog *Basset hound *Weimaraner *Boston terrier *Great Dane *Golden retriever *Labrador retriever *Beagle *German shorthaired pointer *Scottish terrier *Pug *Shar pei *Rhodesian ridgeback =Cats= Two types of mast cell tumors have been identified in cats, a mast cell type similar to dogs and a histiocytic type that appears as subcutaneous nodules and may resolve spontaneously. Young Siamese cats are at an increased risk for the histiocytic type, although the mast cell type is the most common in all cats and is considered to be benign when confined to the skin. Mast cell tumors of the skin are usually located on the head or trunk. Gastrointestinal and splenic involvement is more common in cats than in dogs; 50 percent of cases in dogs primarily involved the spleen or intestines. Gastrointestinal mast cell tumors are most commonly found in the muscularis layer of the small intestine, but can also be found in the large intestine. It is the third most common intestinal tumor in cats, after lymphoma and adenocarcinoma. Diagnosis and treatment are similar to that of the dog. Cases involving difficult to remove or multiple tumors have responded well to strontium-90 radiotherapy as an alternative to surgery. The prognosis for solitary skin tumors is good, but guarded for tumors in other organs. Histological grading of tumors has little bearing on prognosis.

It lacks significant hypnotic, euphoric, or analgesic effects affording it with very low addictive potential. This agent is primarily used for its antitussive (cough-suppressing) effects. Medical uses Noscapine is often used as an antitussive medication. A 2012 Dutch guideline, however, does not recommend its use for acute coughing. Side effects *Nausea *Vomiting *Loss of coordination *Hallucinations (auditory and visual) *Loss of sexual drive *Swelling of prostate *Loss of appetite *Dilated pupils *Increased heart rate *Shaking and muscle spasms *Chest pains *Increased alertness *Loss of any sleepiness *Loss of stereoscopic vision Interactions Noscapine can increase the effects of centrally sedating substances such as alcohol and hypnotics. The drug should not be taken with any MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors), as unknown and potentially fatal effects may occur. Noscapine should not be taken in conjunction with warfarin as the anticoagulant effects of warfarin may be increased. Mechanism of action Noscapine's antitussive effects appear to be primarily mediated by its œÉ‚Äìreceptor agonist activity. Evidence for this mechanism is suggested by experimental evidence in rats. Pretreatment with rimcazole, a œÉ-specific antagonist, causes a dose-dependent reduction in antitussive activity of noscapine. Noscapine, and its synthetic derivatives called noscapinoids, are known to interact with microtubules and inhibit cancer cell proliferation Structure analysis The lactone ring is unstable and opens in basic media. The opposite reaction is presented in acidic media. The bond (C1‚àíC3‚Ä≤) connecting the two optically active carbon atoms is also unstable. In aqueous solution of sulfuric acid and heating it dissociates into cotarnine (4-methoxy-6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]isoquinoline) and opic acid (6-formyl-2,3-dimethoxybenzoic acid). When noscapine is reduced with zinc/HCl, the bond C1‚àíC3‚Ä≤ saturates and the molecule dissociates into hydrocotarnine (2-hydroxycotarnine) and meconine (6,7-dimethoxyisobenzofuran-1(3H)-one). History Noscapine was first isolated and characterized in chemical breakdown and properties in 1817 under the denomination of \\"Narcotine\\"Observations sur le m√©moire de M. Sertuerner relatif √† l‚Äôanalyse de l‚Äôopium, Robiquet, Annales de Chimie et de Physique, volume 5 (1817), p. 275‚Äì278 by Pierre Robiquet, a French chemist in Paris. Robiquet conducted over 20 years between 1815 and 1835 a series of studies in the enhancement of methods for the isolation of morphine, and also isolated in 1832 another very important component of raw opium, that he called codeine, currently a widely used opium-derived compound. Society and cultureRecreational use= There are anecdotal reports of the recreational use of over-the-counter drugs in several countries, being readily available from local pharmacies without a prescription. The effects, beginning around 45 to 120 minutes after consumption, are similar to dextromethorphan and alcohol intoxication. Unlike dextromethorphan, noscapine is not an NMDA receptor antagonist. =Noscapine in heroin= Noscapine can survive the manufacturing processes of heroin and can be found in street heroin. This is useful for law enforcement agencies, as the amounts of contaminants can identify the source of seized drugs. In 2005 in Li√®ge, Belgium, the average noscapine concentration was around 8%. Noscapine has also been used to identify drug users who are taking street heroin at the same time as prescribed diamorphine. Since the diamorphine in street heroin is the same as the pharmaceutical diamorphine, examination of the contaminants is the only way to test whether street heroin has been used. Other contaminants used in urine samples alongside noscapine include papaverine and acetylcodeine. Noscapine is metabolised by the body, and is itself rarely found in urine, instead being present as the primary metabolites, cotarnine and meconine. Detection is performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry (LCMS) but can also use a variety of other analytical techniques. Research Clinical Trials = The efficacy of noscapine in the treatment of certain hematological malignancies has been explored in the clinic. Polyploidy induction by noscapine has been observed in vitro in human lymphocytes at high dose levels (>30 ŒºM); however, low-level systemic exposure, e.g. with cough medications, does not appear to present a genotoxic hazard. The mechanism of polyploidy induction by noscapine is suggested to involve either chromosome spindle apparatus damage or cell fusion. = Noscapine Biosynthesis Reconstitution = Many of the enzymes in the noscapine biosynthetic pathway was elucidated by the discovery of a 10 gene \\"operon-like cluster\\" named HN1. In 2016, the biosynthetic pathway of noscapine was reconstituted in yeast cells, allowing the drug to be synthesised without the requirement of harvest and purification from plant material. In 2018, the entire noscapine pathway was reconstituted and produced in yeast from simple molecules. In addition, protein expression was optimised in yeast, allowing production of noscapine to be improved 18,000 fold.

Early life and education Sebold was born in Madison, Wisconsin. She grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia, where her father taught Spanish at the University of Pennsylvania. Sebold graduated from Great Valley High School in Malvern, Pennsylvania, in 1980. In the early hours of May 8, 1981, while Sebold was a freshman at Syracuse University, she was assaulted and raped while walking home through a park near campus. She reported the crime to the police, who took her statement and investigated, but could not identify any suspects. Sebold returned home to Pennsylvania for the summer before returning to Syracuse University to finish her bachelor's degree and study writing. On October 5, 1981, while walking down a street near the Syracuse campus, she recognized her rapist. She notified police, who were able to capture the man, and she testified against the rapist in court; he was convicted of rape and sodomy, and sentenced to eight to 25 years in prison. Her attacker is out of prison now, but Sebold says she has not kept track of his whereabouts. After graduating from Syracuse in 1984, Sebold briefly attended the University of Houston in Texas, for graduate school, then moved to Manhattan for the next 10 years. She held several waitressing jobs while pursuing a writing career, but neither her poetry nor her attempts at writing a novel came to fruition. She also began using heroin recreationally. Sebold recounted her substance abuse to students at an Evening of Fiction workshop by saying: \\"I did a lot of things that I am not particularly proud of and that I can‚Äôt believe that I did.\\" Sebold left New York for Southern California, where she became a caretaker of an artists' colony, earning $386 a month and living in a cabin in the woods without electricity. She ultimately obtained an MFA from the University of California, Irvine in 1998.Beyond Death: A Conversation with Alice Sebold Weber State University Career In New York, Sebold began writing the book that would become Lucky, as a 10-page assignment for her class. The book's title came from a policeman who had told Sebold that she was lucky to be alive, since another young woman had been killed and dismembered in the same tunnel. At the age of 33, Sebold began writing a novel called Monsters, about the rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl. The story was based on her realization that \\"within the suburban world of my upbringing there was as many strange stories as there were in the more romanticized parts of the world.\\" The novel eventually became The Lovely Bones, which one reviewer called \\"a disturbing story, full of horror and confusion and deep, bone-weary sadness. And yet it reflects a moving, passionate interest in and love for ordinary life as its most wonderful, and most awful, even at its most mundane.\\" The New York Times observed that \\"Ms. Sebold [has] the ability to capture both the ordinary and the extraordinary, the banal and the horrific, in lyrical, unsentimental prose.\\" In an interview with Publishers Weekly, Sebold said, \\"I was motivated to write about violence because I believe it's not unusual. I see it as just a part of life, and I think we get in trouble when we separate people who've experienced it from those who haven't. Though it's a horrible experience, it's not as if violence hasn't affected many of us.\\" The Lovely Bones remained on The New York Times Bestseller list for over one year and was adapted into a 2010 film of the same name by Peter Jackson starring Saoirse Ronan as Susie Salmon, Susan Sarandon as Grandma Lynn, Stanley Tucci as George Harvey, Mark Wahlberg as Jack Salmon, and Rachel Weisz as Abigail Salmon. Sebold's second novel, The Almost Moon, continued what The New Yorker called \\"Sebold's fixation on terror.\\" The novel begins, \\"When all is said and done, killing my mother came easily.\\" Sebold also guest-edited The Best American Short Stories 2009. The process required her to read over 200 submitted short stories and to choose only 20 for inclusion in the anthology.} Awards Sebold won the American Booksellers Association Book of the Year Award for Adult Fiction in 2003 The Lovely Bones and the Bram Stoker Award for First Novel in 2002. Sebold was a fellow at the Ragdale Foundation and at the MacDowell Colony. Personal life Sebold was previously married to the writer Glen David Gold.

The last 12 specimens were collected on 26 December 1931. Etymology The generic name comes from the Ancient Greek pero = \\"boots\\", mys meaning \\"mouse\\", hence the \\"mouse with boots\\", referring to the white feet. Description P. pembertoni is a medium-sized deer mouse. No significant sexual dimorphism is evident. The tail is usually longer than the head, and the body is bicolored. It is well-haired, and tufted at the end. The hind feet are small and similar in length to the ear, but sometimes longer. The skull is medium-sized, and auditory bullae are not greatly inflated. The upper parts of the pelage are medium brown; the sides are lighter brown with a broad orange lateral line extending from the cheek to the hindquarters; the under parts are whitish, the ankles dusky gray, and the feet whitish below ankle. General information Peromyscus species, also known as deer mice, are common North American mammals. They tend to occur in range from Alaska to Central America in many different habitats. Because they are so abundant in nature, these mice constitute a large component of the nearctic ecosystems. These mice have also been of very great importance to scientific research, both the wild type and genetic variants have been used for laboratory researches. They are not closely related to the house mouse and the rats. Pemberton's deer mouse is a very cold-tolerant species; they live and survive in temperatures between 22 and 25 ¬∞C. They are usually sexually mature by 55 days of age. Gestation is 23 days, except in lactating, females when it is delayed by four to six days to 28 or 30 days. P. pembertoni breeds in mated pairs. Habitat This species is poorly known. The only island that supported two different species of Peromyscus - P. pembertoni and P. boylii - was San Pedro Nolasco. Besides these two species, no other mammals occurred on the island. They were collected on a steep hill covered with grass on the eastern side of the island. The dominant plants found there were tree torote, pitayita, liga, Adam's tree, leather plant, fishhook cactus, malva rosa, chain fruit cholla, cardon, slipper plant, jojoba, and organpipe cactus. Reproduction The social behavior of P. pembertoni is unknown. Breeding probably occurred throughout most of the year, although the majority of young would have been born in spring and early summer. Breeding may have ceased during winter months. Communication and perception Like other Peromyscus species, they probably had keen eyesight and vision, and used chemical cues extensively in communication. Predation P. pembertoni would have escaped predation through its nocturnal and secretive habits. Lifespan The longevity of P. pembertoni was probably short, with it unlikely that more than a few would live more than one year under natural conditions.

History  Having studied Xing Yi Quan with Guo Yunshen in his childhood,The Way Of Power, Lam Kam Chuen, Gaia Books, 2003 Wang Xiangzhai travelled China, meeting and comparing skills with masters of various styles of kung fu. In the mid-1920s, he came to the conclusion that Xingyiquan students put too much emphasis on complex patterns of movement (outer form 'xing'), while he believed in the prevalent importance of the development of the mind in order to boost physical martial art skills. Jan Diepersloot. \\"The Tao of Yiquan. The Method of Awareness in the Martial Arts. . page 69, pages 73-74. He started to teach what he felt was the true essence of the art using a different name, without the 'xing' (form). Wang Xiangzhai, who had a great knowledge about the theory and history of his art, called it \\"Yiquan\\" (ÊÑèÊã≥). In the 1940s one of Wang Xiangzhai's students wrote an article about his \\"school\\" and named it \\"Dachengquan\\" (Â§ßÊàêÊã≥), which means \\"great achievement boxing\\". This name was not used by Wang Xiangzhai. Wang thought the name was a poor choice as it was boastful and not very descriptive of the intent.Jan Diepersloot. \\"The Tao of Yiquan. The Method of Awareness in the Martial Arts. . pages 78-79. In the 1930s in Shanghai, Wang's school became famous. A few of his core students were training with him at that time. Brothers Han Xing Qiao and Han Xing Yuan, Shao Dao Sheng (perhaps Wang's most accomplished student), all came together during this period. Han Xing Qiao, who was formally adopted by Wang as a son and lived with him for 15 years, was studying One Finger Tui Na with Qian Yan Tang, a famous scholar and doctor. Wang Xiangzhai and Qian Yan Tang hit it off and studied medicine and culture together, becoming brothers in researching many mysteries. It was here that Qian introduced the idea that further exploration of Zhan Zhuang, a standing practice first and most foundationally taught by Wang's uncle and teacher Guo You Sheng, might be fundamental to the development of Yiquan. Wang Xiangzhai researched this idea in Qian's library, which was full of classic texts. Wang was always changing the practice and method of Yiquan, always innovating, based on natural principles. Much of the development of Yiquan was done in Shanghai. With the help of Han Xing Qiao, Wang set the Zhan Zhuang in order, creating a system seven stages. Later, the basic eight postures were refined into Ju, Bao, Peng, Tway, An, Hua, Ti and closing with Jia So Su. These basic eight postures are still the core of Zhang Zhuang. When Wang Xiangzhai (and later Han Xing Chiao) moved to Beijing, Han found that Wang was only teaching three Zhuang. Bao is the universal Zhuang, and so Wang only really taught Bao from that point on. Most of the other practices were dropped as well (for example, push hands and Fa Li). However, students still tried to use Fa Li improperly. When the students saw Wang move fast, they thought of it as Fa Li, or issuing force. There is actually no difference in practicing fast or slow. There is no force at all. The misconception is caused by the mind. The mind conceives of the result as based in two different states, hard and soft, as well as fast and slow. As long as the mind clings to this dualistic model, the student will break everything into two. But the moment of experience is only one. Wang continued development of his art, but few, if any, could follow. Only those who could grasp the one state, and keep it, can move with it. Schools that were founded by students who never progressed this far are numerous to this day. This has always been the social factor of true transmission.  The style  Yiquan is essentially formless, containing no fixed sets of fighting movements or techniques. Instead, focus is put on developing one's natural movement and fighting abilities through a system of training methods and concepts, working to improve the perception of one's body, its movement, and of force. Yiquan is also set apart from other eastern martial arts in that traditional concepts like qi, meridians, dantian etc., are omitted, the reason being that understanding one's true nature happens in the present, and that preconceptions block this process. Yiquan is a distillation of the internal aspects at the core of all arts that Wang was exposed to, including Fujian h√®qu√°n, T'ai chi ch'uan, bƒÅgu√†zh«éng, and Liuhebafa . Other arts as well, such as the swimming dragon posture, present in shiao jiao, is transformed through feeling, understanding, and the condition of the practitioner. In fact, typical movements and postures from other systems abound in yiquan. It was the internal core of these other arts that made them effective. This core is what Master Wang decoded. = Overview = The actual training in yiquan can generally be divided into: *Zhan zhuang (Á´ôÊ®Å) Standing pole postures where emphasis is put on natural condition, working to improve listening to the body and on developing hunyuan li, \\"Natural living force\\" or \\"all things that make the whole\\". *Shi li (Ë©¶Âäõ) Testing force moving exercises, trying to bring the sensations of hunyuan li developed through Zhan zhuang into movements. All of the other practices can be put into one of these two methods. Different schools practice some degree of different footworks, (Bu Fa and Mo ca Bu), and different movements leading towards free expression of the collected state. Principle of Nature: All truth and action occur in Shunjian, the split second of now. Everything before and after this moment is 'Wu', the Void, and thus, uncontrollable or unknowable. All objective and preconception is fixed and not in accordance with this undetermined state of Nature. \\"The Dao that is called the Dao is not the eternal Dao\\".

It is usually found in males aged 30 to 40. It originates in fibrous tissues of the bone and invades long or flat bones such as the femur, tibia, and mandible. It also involves the periosteum and overlying muscle. Presentation Adult-type= Individuals presenting with fibrosarcoma are usually adults thirty to fifty-five years old, often presenting with pain. Among adults, males have a higher incidence for fibrosarcoma than females. =Infantile-type= In infants, fibrosarcoma (often termed congenital infantile fibrosarcoma) is usually congenital. Infants presenting with this fibrosarcoma usually do so in the first two years of their life. Cytogenetically, congenital infantile fibrosarcoma is characterized by the majority of cases having a translocation between chromosomes 12 and 15 (notated as t(12;15)(p13;q25)) that results in formation of the fusion gene, ETV6-NTRK3, plus individual cases exhibiting trisomy for chromosomes 8, 11, 17, or 20. The histology, association with the ETV6-NRTK3 fusion gene as well as certain chromosome trisomies, and the distribution of markers for cell type (i.e. cyclin D1 and Beta-catenin) within this tumor are similar to those found in the cellular form of mesoblastic nephroma. Indeed, mesoblastic nephroma and congenital infantile sarcoma appear to be the same disease with the exception that mesoblastic lymphoma originates in the kidney whereas congenital infantile sarcoma originates in non-renal tissues.  Pathology  The tumor may present different degrees of differentiation: low grade (differentiated), intermediate malignancy and high malignancy (anaplastic). Depending on this differentiation, tumour cells may resemble mature fibroblasts (spindle-shaped), secreting collagen, with rare mitoses. These cells are arranged in short fascicles which split and merge, giving the appearance of \\"fish bone\\" known as a herringbone pattern. Poorly differentiated tumors consist in more atypical cells, pleomorphic, giant cells, multinucleated, numerous atypical mitoses and reduced collagen production. Presence of immature blood vessels (sarcomatous vessels lacking endothelial cells) favors the bloodstream metastasizing. There are many tumors in the differential diagnosis, including spindle cell melanoma, spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma, synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma.  Diagnosis  Ancillary testing for fibrosarcoma includes IHC, where vimentin is positive, cytokeratin and S100 are negative, and actin is variable.  In dogs and cats  Cat after 4th Fibrosarcoma OP =Dogs= Fibrosarcoma occurs most frequently in the mouth in dogs. The tumor is locally invasive, and often recurs following surgery. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are also used in treatment. Fibrosarcoma is also a rare bone tumor in dogs. =Cats= In cats, fibrosarcoma occurs on the skin. It is also the most common vaccine-associated sarcoma. In 2014, Merial launched Oncept IL-2 in Europe for the management of such feline fibrosarcomas. Bostock DE, et al. performed a study of cats that had fibrosarcomas excised and were followed for a minimum of 3 years, or until death. Two factors, tumor site and mitotic index, were found to be of prognostic significance, but tumor size, duration of growth, and histologic appearance were not. Following removal of fibrosarcomas from the flank in 6 cats, none died as a result of the tumor but 24 of 35 (70%) cats with fibrosarcoma in the skin of the head, back, or limbs were euthanatized because of local recurrence, usually within 9 months of surgery.

He worked as a high-school history teacher before entering political life. His son Evan, ran for the NDP in the 2011 election in the riding of Ajax‚ÄîPickering. He was active in the environmental movement. He was the founding member of a local environment group called Pickering/Ajax Citizens Together For The Environment. Politics Wiseman ran for the Ontario legislature in the 1987 provincial election, and finished third behind Liberal Norah Stoner and a Progressive Conservative candidate in the Greater Toronto Area riding of Durham West. He ran for the federal New Democratic Party in the Canadian election of 1988 in the riding of Ontario. During the campaign he spoke against Toronto dumping garbage at Brock West a local garbage dump. He finished third behind Progressive Conservative Ren√© Soetens and a Liberal candidate. Wiseman ran again in the provincial election of 1990. This time he was elected over Norah Stoner by 1,982 votes. During the next five years in government he served as parliamentary assistant to several ministers between 1991 and 1995. In 1992, Wiseman and fellow Durham MPP Drummond White became involved in a minor controversy when it was found they were billing taxpayers for the cost of renting a shared apartment in Toronto. He claimed that working long hours as an MPP justified his need for the apartment. Due to the publicity, he and White ended the lease in August 1992.

The performance film is of Gray's play and monologue, which centered on such themes as his trip to Southeast Asia to create the role of the U.S. Ambassador's aide in the film The Killing Fields, the Cold War, Cambodia Year Zero, and his search for his \\"perfect moment\\". It was nominated for Best Feature, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay at the 1988 Independent Spirit Awards. Background Over a period of two years, Gray originally developed Swimming to Cambodia as a theatre performance piece. The original running time of the performance was a total of four hours long, and it was presented over two nights. Gray received a Special Citation for this work at the 1985 Obie Awards. In 2001, Gray revived Swimming to Cambodia, performing it on stage in Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, and Albany, New York. Content The opening shots of the film show Gray walking toward The Performing Garage in New York City. He goes in and, after walking past the audience, he takes a seat behind a table. On the table is a glass of water, a microphone, and a notebook, the latter brought by Gray. Behind him are two pull-down maps. One is a map of Southeast Asia and the other is a diagram of the bombing of Cambodia, which Gray tells the viewers/audience was called Operation Breakfast. There is also a back-lit projection screen showing a photograph of a beach. Gray performs a monologue in which he discusses his experiences filming a small role in the film The Killing Fields. He also expounds on the recent history of Cambodia up through the rise to power of the Khmer Rouge and the Cambodian genocide. Three scenes from The Killing Fields that feature Gray are shown at various points in the film. Production The soundtrack for the film was composed and performed by Laurie Anderson, who would also score Gray's follow-up film, Monster in a Box. Gray returned the favor by providing the voice of a TV interviewer for her 1986 short film, What You Mean We?. No soundtrack album was released; Anderson later reused music from the film for a series of \\"Personal Service Announcements\\" which she produced in 1989 to promote her album, Strange Angels. While Sam Waterston and Ira Wheeler are credited as cast in this film, they appear only in clips used from The Killing Fields. Home media Shout!

It was the first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on November 13, 1994. In the episode, Lisa discovers that she possesses a skill for ice hockey. A rivalry between her and Bart ensues. The episode was written by Mike Scully and directed by Bob Anderson. Anderson's passion for hockey is what inspired the plot. It features cultural references to films such as Rollerball and The Pope of Greenwich Village. The episode was well-received by critics and acquired a Nielsen rating of 11.6. Plot Principal Skinner gathers Springfield Elementary School students at an assembly to announce which subjects they are failing. To her horror, straight-A student Lisa discovers she is failing gym class. When she appeals to her gym teacher, they reach a compromise: Lisa will get a passing grade if she joins a sports program outside of school. She attempts to join several but fails, which devastates her self-esteem. Later, the family watches Bart play hockey for his team, the Mighty Pigs, coached by Chief Wiggum. After the game, Bart ridicules his sister for being poor at sports and uses his hockey stick to pelt her with litter. After watching Lisa deflect the litter and catch hockey pucks, Apu, the coach of the Kwik-E-Mart Gougers, thinks she would be a natural and makes her his team's goalie. Lisa excels as goalie and leads her team to its best season ever. Encouraged by Homer playing favorites, a sibling rivalry develops between Bart and Lisa. It peaks when the town learns that the Gougers will face the Mighty Pigs at their next match. The game is viciously fought, with Bart and Lisa playing their best. With four seconds left, Bart is tripped by Jimbo, giving him a penalty shot against Lisa that will decide the game. As they face off, Bart and Lisa remember the good times they had together when they were younger. After they throw aside their equipment and hug, the match ends in a tie -- much to Marge's pride and Homer's distress. Dissatisfied with the outcome, the residents of Springfield riot and trash the arena. Production alt=A man speaks into a microphone. The idea for the episode came from The Simpsons writer Mike Scully, who wanted to do an episode involving ice hockey because of his passion for the sport. Bob Anderson, who also had a small interest in hockey, directed the episode. To better familiarize himself with the sport, Anderson ordered a batch of VHS highlight tapes, watched the NHL playoffs for the first time, and made several trips to scout youth games, taking notes on how players looked stickhandling and shooting. In his original draft of the episode, Scully had written cameos for Bobby Orr and Wayne Gretzky but, he explained, \\"they wound up falling out of the story, because we had such a good story with the family.\\" Gretzky eventually ended up appearing in the Season 28 episode \\"The Nightmare After Krustmas\\", becoming the first hockey player to guest on the show. The episode starts out with Lisa tricking Bart into believing it is a snow day by throwing a snowball at him which she made out of the ice in the fridge. The scene was inspired by Scully, who as a child loved to sit and listen by the radio waiting to see if there was going to be a school snow day. Scully thought, because of his experience as a child, that there was nothing more disappointing than to wake up expecting a snow day, only to find out there was no snow. The academic alerts the Springfield Elementary School students receive were based on those Scully received in junior high. The scene where Milhouse was bound by his hands and legs to the net was inspired by stories Scully had heard about Springfield Indians owner Eddie Shore tying his players to the posts \\"trying to teach his goalies to stay in the crease.\\" Lisa's line, \\"Hack the bone! Hack the bone!\\" was inspired by ex‚ÄìSpringfield Kings backstop Billy Smith. Although there was an emphasis on detail for the show, one mistake Scully regrets is having the game clock running (and eventually expiring) on Bart‚Äôs penalty shot. The clock would be paused in a normal hockey game until the shot was taken. Besides of this factual error, Bart's team would have eventually won the game due the rules violation of Lisa during the penalty shot: Throwing any goalie equipment during penalty shot a goal will be called to the team who had the penalty shot in first place. Lisa throws off stick and both gloves before Bart does the same.

It was the second-highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Retrieved on September 28, 2008. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it \\"a fabulous episode for Lisa and Bart, although with a special mention for a few seconds of tremendous Edna Krabappel wickedness\\". DVD Verdict's Ryan Keefer said the episode \\"is one of the few episodes centered on Lisa that I enjoy watching\\", and gave it a B+ grade. DVD Talk's Aaron Beierle said, \\"there are definitely some funny moments in this episode, the sweet-natured way that the episode ends never sat right with me\\". ESPN.com named this episode the fifth best sports moment in the history of the show. The Orlando Sentinels Gregory Hardy listed it as the seventh-best episode of the show with a sports theme. TV Squad's Adam Finley gave the episode a positive review, commenting that it is \\"a skewering of parents who become too involved in their children's sports and turn what should be a lesson in teamwork, trying your hardest, and losing gracefully into a kind of Roman Coliseum where grown adults live out violent fantasies and their own failed ambitions through their children\\". He added, \\"Homer is an absolute jerk in this episode, taunting his children when they lose and praising them when they win and humiliate their sibling\\" and \\"it's not just Homer. Marge, characteristically so, tries to remain diplomatic, but even she starts screaming for blood when Bart is tripped by an opposing player.\\" ReferencesExternal links *\\"Lisa on Ice\\" at The Simpsons.com  Category:The Simpsons (season 6) episodes Category:1994 American television episodes Category:Ice hockey mass media fi:Simpsonit (6. tuotantokausi)#Lisan liukkaat (Lisa on Ice) ","title":"Lisa on Ice"},{"id":"1624787","text":"The lesser stick-nest rat or white-tipped stick-nest rat (Leporillus apicalis) is an extinct species of rodent in the family Muridae. It lived in central Australia where it built nests of sticks that accumulate over years and can become very large. The last confirmed sighting of this rat was in 1933 although there is a credible report of a sighting in 1970. In 2008, the International Union for Conservation of Nature listed it as \\"critically endangered\\", suggesting that it may yet survive in remote areas of unsurveyed territory, but revised its evaluation to \\"extinct\\" again in 2016, based on an assessment in 2012. Behaviour It accumulated large mounds of sticks to construct its nests, which were up to three metres long and a metre high. It was easily tamed, sometimes climbing onto tables to get sugar. It was also eaten by people. The last capture was filmed on 18 July 1933, when the stick- nests were set alight. The specimens are held in the South Australian Museum. The rat may have declined from competition with cattle and sheep. The reduction in available food sources also caused them to be more vulnerable to predators like owls Copley, Peter. ‚ÄúNatural Histories of Australia‚Äôs Stick- Nest Rats, Genus Leporillus (Rodentia : Muridae).‚Äù Wildlife Research, vol. 26, no. 4, 1999, p. 513., doi:10.1071/wr97056.. There is a possibility that a lesser stick-nest rat was seen in a cave in Western Australia in 1970. The last specimen was found at Mount Crombie. Gerard Krefft in 1862 wrote that he encountered the species in Euston, Bourke, and on both sides of the Murray and on the Darling. He could dislodge up to 15 individuals from a single tree and kept a large number of them in captivity. They were tame enough that any that escaped came back to join him for supper, \\"and help[ed] themselves, to damper especially\\". On a similar note, he also wrote that they themselves had \\"flesh white, tender, and well-tasted\\". Krefft tried to keep lesser-stick nest rats in a box with greater-stick nest rats but found that they kept fighting and that the former always remained victorious. Conservation status assessment The 2008 release of the updated IUCN status for the lesser stick-nest rat downgraded the conservation status from extinct to critically endangered (possibly extinct), owing to the very slight possibility that a very small population may still exist in yet to be surveyed remote lands of the Australian interior. This was based on a reliable record from 1970, continued occasional reports of fresh vegetation being added to old stick-nests, and much of this species' range being in remote portions of central Australia which have not yet been fully surveyed. However, the classification was revised to \\"extinct\\" again in 2016.

However, many dispute the alleged miraculous descent of the Fire. Description from within the Orthodox faith Holy Fire in 2018 Orthodox tradition holds that the Holy Fire happens annually on the day preceding Orthodox Pascha (Orthodox Easter). During this time, blue light is said to emit within Jesus Christ's tomb, rising from the marble slab covering the stone bed believed to be that upon which Jesus' body is to have been placed for burial. The marble slab is now in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City of Jerusalem. The light is believed to form a column of fire, from which candles are lit. This fire is then used to light the candles of the clergy and pilgrims in attendance. The fire is also said to spontaneously light other lamps and candles around the church. Pilgrims and clergy say that the Holy Fire does not burn them. While the Patriarch is inside the chapel kneeling in front of the stone, there is darkness but far from silence outside. One hears a rather loud mumbling, and the atmosphere is very tense. When the Patriarch comes out with the two candles lit and shining brightly in the darkness, a roar of jubilation resounds in the Church.Light at the Holy Sepulchre, Great Miracle Given by God, Only to the Orthodox Church // The Christian Life. 1 January - 31 March 1999 (Vol. 42 / No. 1-3) Thousands of pilgrims as well as local Christians of all denominations gather in Jerusalem to partake and witness this annual event.http://www.timesofisrael.com/christian-pilgrims-gather-in-jerusalem-for- holy-fire-ritual/ The Holy Fire is taken to Greece by special flight,The Holy Fire Arrives in Athens From Jerusalem By Areti Kotseli on 14 April 2012 in News.

History The historian Eusebius writes in his Vita Constantini, which dates from around 328, about an interesting occurrence in Jerusalem of Easter in the year 162. When the church wardens were about to fill the lamps to make them ready to celebrate the resurrection of Christ, they suddenly noticed that there was no more oil left to pour in the lamps. Upon this, Bishop Narcissus of Jerusalem ordered the candles to be filled with water. He then told the wardens to ignite them. In front of the eyes of all present every single lamp burned as if filled with pure oil.Meinardus, Otto. The Ceremony of the Holy Fire in the Middle Ages and to-day. Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© d'Arch√©ologie Copte, 16, 1961-2. Page 242-253 Christian Orthodox tradition holds that this miracle, which predates the construction of the Holy Sepulchre in the fourth century, is related to the Miracle of the Holy Fire. They admit that the two differ, as the former was a one-time occurrence while the Miracle of the Holy Fire occurs every year. However, they have in common the premise that God has produced fire where there, logically speaking, should have been none. Around 385 Egeria, a noble woman from Spain, traveled to Palestine. In the account of her journey, she speaks of a ceremony by the Holy Sepulchre of Christ, where a light comes forth (ejicitur) from the small chapel enclosing the tomb, by which the entire church is filled with an infinite light (lumen infinitum). Despite these previous instances, the Holy Fire is believed to have been first recorded by the Christian pilgrim, Bernard the Wise (Bernardus Monachus), in 876. Under Baldwin I, Latin clergy had taken over the Holy Sepulchre, and according to Christopher Tyerman, the Greek clergy were restored \\"after the fiasco of the failure of the regular Easter miracle of the Holy Fire under Latin auspices in 1101, the annual ritual on Easter eve when Holy Fire is supposed to descend from heaven to light the priests' candles in the edicule of the Holy Sepulchre. The newcomers evidently had not learnt the knack.\\"Tyerman, Christopher. God's War: A New History of the Crusades, Harvard University Press, 2006, p. 231 The ceremony was marred in 2002 when a disagreement between the Armenian and Greek bishops over who should emerge first with the Holy Fire led to a struggle between the factions. In the course of the scuffle, the Greek Patriarch twice blew the Armenian's candle out, forcing him to reignite his \\"Holy Fire\\" using a cigarette lighter, while the Greek Patriarch was despoiled of one of his shoes. In the end the Israeli Police entered the premises to restore order. Criticism and opposition In 1009, Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah ordered the destruction of the Holy Sepulchre and its associated buildings, apparently outraged by what he regarded as the fraud practiced by the monks in the \\"miraculous\\" descent of the Holy Fire. The chronicler Yahia said that \\"only those things that were too difficult to demolish were spared.\\" Processions were prohibited, and a few years later all of the convents and churches in Palestine were said to have been destroyed or confiscated.Robert Ousterhout, \\"Rebuilding the Temple: Constantine Monomachus and the Holy Sepulchre\\" in The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Vol. 48, No. 1 (March, 1989), pp. 66‚Äì78 In 1238, Pope Gregory IX denounced the Holy Fire as a fraud and forbade Franciscans from participating in the ceremony. Similarly, many Christians have remained unconvinced by the occurrence. According to Shihab al-Din al-Qarafi, the 13th- century Ayyubid ruler Al-Muazzam Turanshah (r. 1249‚Äì1250) is mentioned as having discovered the fraudulence of the Holy Fire; however, he allowed the monks to continue their fraud in exchange for money. The Ottoman traveller, Evliya Celebi (1611‚Äì1682), said that a hidden zinc jar of naphtha was dripped down a chain by a hidden monk.Jerusalem: The Biography, page 305, Simon Sebag Montefiore, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2011. Edward Gibbon (1737‚Äì1794), wrote scathingly about the alleged phenomenon in the concluding volume of The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire: > This pious fraud, first devised in the ninth century, was devoutly cherished > by the Latin crusaders, and is annually repeated by the clergy of the Greek, > Armenian, and Coptic sects, who impose on the credulous spectators for their > own benefit and that of their tyrants.Edward Gibbon. The History of the > Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Vol. VI. Chapter LVII. Everyman's > Library. p. 34. Thomas Tegg, a 19th-century Englishman, included an account of the event in The London Encyclopaedia, published in 1828, speculating that the event is purely natural and motivated by pecuniary interest.Thomas Tegg (1829). London Encyclopaedia Volume 16, page 449, in the article on Palestine. N. Hailes. Some Greeks have been critical of the Holy Fire, such as Adamantios Korais, who condemned what he considered to be religious fraud in his treatise \\"On the Holy Light of Jerusalem.\\" He referred to the event as \\"machinations of fraudulent priests\\" and to the \\"unholy\\" light of Jerusalem as \\"a profiteers' miracle\\". In 2005, in a live demonstration on Greek television,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S66f87b05oM Michael Kalopoulos, author and historian of religion, dipped three candles in white phosphorus. The candles spontaneously ignited after approximately 20 minutes due to the self-ignition properties of white phosphorus when in contact with air. According to Kalopoulos' website: > If phosphorus is dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent, self-ignition > is delayed until the solvent has almost completely evaporated. Repeated > experiments showed that the ignition can be delayed for half an hour or > more, depending on the density of the solution and the solvent employed. Kalopoulos also says that chemical reactions of this nature were well known in ancient times, quoting Strabo, who states: \\"In Babylon there are two kinds of naphtha springs, a white and a black. The white naphtha is the one that ignites with fire.\\" (Strabon Geographica 16.1.15.1-24) He further states that phosphorus was used by Chaldean magicians in the early fifth century BC, and by the ancient Greeks, in a way similar to its supposed use today by the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem. Russian skeptic Igor Dobrokhotov has analysed the evidence for an alleged miracle at length on his website, including the ancient sources and contemporary photos and videos. Dobrokhotov and other critics, including Russian Orthodox researcher Nikolay Uspensky, Dr. Aleksandr Musin of Sorbonne, and some Old Believers quote excerpts from the diaries of Bishop Porphyrius (Uspensky) (1804‚Äì1885), which told that the clergy in Jerusalem knew that the Holy Fire was fraudulent. In his book, the journalist Dimitris Alikakos presents an interview with the skeuophylax Archbishop Isidoros of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem, in which the former admits that the \\"Sleepless Candle\\", which he, himself, puts into the Church of the Holy Sepulchre during the morning of the Holy Saturday, is ignited by him with a lighter. The former (1984-1988) skeuophylax Archbishop Nikiforos makes the same acknowledgement, except that he was using matches. In the same book, Archbishop Gerason Theofanis states that the Holy Fire does not light up in a miraculous, but in a natural way, and it is then blessed by the Patriarch. He adds: \\"we deceive the believers letting them believe that it is a miracle. This is unacceptable, and does not reflect well on us\\". According to Theofanis, the fraud of the \\"miracle\\" was invented by Catholic crusaders a few centuries ago, and unfortunately was later continued by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate. In addition, the Metropolitan Bishop Kornilios of Petras, surrogate of the Jerusalem Patriarchate in 2001, confirmed an older interview, saying that he also had ignited the candles of the Holy Fire with a natural candle, and he described in full detail what he saw when he entered the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Lastly, in his book, the journalist mentions the chronicle of the deletion of the word \\"miracle\\" from the official website of the Patriarchate in 23 June 2018, with the commandment of the Patriarch Theofilos III. One of the Armenian torchbearers, a task that's usually passed down from father to son (or other male member of a torchbearer's family), has admitted that his father revealed to him the truth, that the source of the fire is ancient and symbolic but not a miracle. He said: \\"The Greek priests bring in a lamp - one that has been kept burning for 1,500 years - to produce the Holy Fire. For pilgrims full of faith who come from abroad, it is a fire from Heaven, a true miracle. But not for us.\\" See also * Paschal cycle References External links  * Holy Fire website * Reuters report on the Holy Fire on Youtube * The Holy Light in Jerusalem: Testimonies and Evidence by the Orthodox Outlet for Dogmatic Enquiries * Miracle of the Holy Fire by Niels Christian Hvidt. * Orthodox Christians Celebrate Holy Fire Ritual from National Public Radio * Sparks from the Holy Fire, by Victoria Clark for The Tablet, 3 May 2003. * Holy Fire book by Haris Skarlakidis.

Biography Wang Xiangzhai was born in Hebei province, China. As he was a very weak child, his parents decided to send him to the famous Xingyiquan master Guo Yunshen to improve his health. The Wang family had always had connections with the Guo family, horse breeders in the average. Master Guo Yunshen taught him zhanzhuang gong (post standing postures) that the young Xiangzhai had to keep standing for hours. During his young adult life, Wang Xiangzhai became a soldier in Beijing and at the age of 33, he went all around China, studying martial arts with many famous masters including monk Heng Lin, Xinyiquan master Xie Tiefu, southern white crane style masters Fang Yizhuang and Jin Shaofeng, Liuhebafa master Wu Yihui, etc. Learning from his experience and honoring the truly skilled, Wang made a public statement in 1928: ÊàëÂú®ÂúãÂÖßÂèÉÂ≠∏‰∏á‰ΩôÈáåÔºåÊãúË¶ãÊã≥ÂÆ∂ÈÄæÂçÉ‰∫∫ÔºåÂ†™Á®±ÈÄöÂÆ∂ËÄÖÂÉÖÊúâÂÖ©ÂÄãÂçä‰∫∫ÔºåÂç≥ÊπñÂçóËß£ÈêµÂ§´ÔºåÁ¶èÂª∫ÊñπÊÅ∞Â∫Ñ‰∏é‰∏äÊµ∑Âê≥ÁøºÁø¨ËÄ≥„ÄÇ I have traveled across the country in research, engaging over a thousand people in martial combat, there have been only 2.5 people I could not defeat, namely Hunan's Xie Tiefu, Fujian's Fang Yizhuang and Shanghai's Wu Yihui. After 7 years of research and study, Wang established himself in Beijing and penetrated the circle of famous masters in this city as well as in Tianjin and Shanghai. At this period of his life he was reunited with his friend and classmate from schooldays, the respected Liuhebafa master Wu Yihui, and also became friends with the Baguazhang master Zhang Zhaodong. He started to teach many influential martial artists including Hong Lianshun, Zhao Daoxin, the Han brothers (Han Xingqiao and Han Xingyuan), Yao Zongxun, Zhang Entong, Wang Shujin (who studied Zhanzhuang for one year), and others. He first named his teaching Yiquan, in reference to the Xingyiquan and Xinyiquan styles. Later, in the 1940s, one of his disciples who was a journalist publicly called it Dachengquan, which means \\"great achievement boxing\\". It is still known by both these names today. He received the visit of many Japanese experts during the war. One, Kenichi Sawai was assumed to be his student and created his own school in Japan calling his martial art Taikiken. Sawaii was however solely instructed by Wang's successor Yao Zongxun, and not directly by Wang himself. At the end of his life he performed research into the healing aspect of Zhanzhuang and worked with different hospitals. He died in 1963 in Tianjin, from a disease. He was one of the first Chinese teachers to publicly teach the practice of Zhanzhuang, or 'standing like a tree' methods. In silence there must be movement, and in motion, there must be silence. A small movement is better than a big, no movement is better than a small silence is all the movement's mother. In Movement you should be like a dragon or a tiger.

Retrieved 8 May 2016. is an extinct small hopping marsupial endemic to desert regions of Central Australia. It was discovered in the early 1840s and described by John Gould in London in 1843, on the basis of three specimens sent to him by George Grey, the governor of South Australia at the time. Description It was formed like a kangaroo, but had the bulk of a small rabbit, and was described as having a delicate and slender form. The length of the head and body combined is estimated to be about 254‚Äì282 mm in addition to a 307 to 377 mm long tail. Its head was short, blunt, and wide, different from that of any kangaroo or wallaby with a naked nose, short and rounded ears. The color of its dense, straight, soft fur was appropriate for its desert surroundings. It was very pale yellowish brown, the hairs tipped with sooty brown; interspersed with the under fur were many long brownish white hairs. Its underbelly was described as white with very pale yellowish-brown feet and tail. A distinguishing feature of this species was the difference in size between the fore and hind limbs. Its fore limbs were quite delicate with bones weighing 1 gram, while its hind limbs are large with bones weighing 12 grams. This difference is related to saltation. Other characteristics related to hopping locomotion include a long, but rather thin tail. Distribution and habitat Caloprymnus campestris was thought to occupy a relatively small area in South Australia, extending just over the borders of southwestern Queensland and Northern Territory. It was last seen in 1935 in the eastern Lake Eyre basin of northern Southern Australia The desert rat-kangaroo lived in the desert regions of Australia, including clay pans, loamy flats, sand ridges, and gibber plain habitats. Its native habitat was very arid, cover is sparse, and consists of saltbush and other chenopods and emu bush. Ecology and behaviour Caloprymnus campestris was solitary except for mothers with young offspring. It lived in nests built over shallow depressions in the ground. These nests were excavated or found and are crucial in the desert, where temperatures can be high, while relatively little brush or foliage is available for cover. The \\"pits\\" were lined with grass, which females carried to the nest with their tails. The nest would then be covered with twigs to provide cover from the scorching sun. Often, the desert rat kangaroo was found peeking out of the top of the nest to observe its surroundings. This species would spend most of the day taking cover in the nest, and emerge at dusk to feed. Thus, it was at least partially nocturnal. =Diet= The desert rat-kangaroo was mainly herbivorous, feeding on foliage and stems of desert vegetation, but has also been found to eat insects such as beetles and weevils. It was so independent of water, it even shunned the succulent plants of the sand hills. It was able to survive without any surface water while feeding on green plants. =Locomotion= It had a distinct method of hopping. Its posture was forward and the long tail was extended when it moved at high speeds. Unlike other marsupials, Caloprymnus would land with the right foot in front of the left foot. It showed great endurance while being chased on horseback at high speeds (Finlayson reported chasing an individual over 12 miles), and \\"paused only to die\\". =Reproduction= Females reached sexual maturity at about 11 months, while males reached maturity some two months later. Marked sexual dimorphism was apparent, with females being larger. Females went through estrus at three-week intervals and could mate throughout the year. Although able to mate all year, they had an irregular breeding season when most mating took place. Females with pouched joeys had been found between June and December. Young were born very undeveloped, as is typical of marsupials. Gestation was probably around one to two months, with a pouch period of two to three months. All females were found with only one young at a time. Young remained dependent for over a month after leaving the pouch and soon after would leave permanently. Rediscovery and extinction The desert rat-kangaroo was discovered in the early 1840s. However, after these early sightings, it was no longer recorded for 90 years (aside from an unconfirmed report in 1878), and was widely believed to be extinct. This species, even before European colonisation, was apparently never abundant. Following the relief of drought conditions which improved the local habitat, the animal was rediscovered in 1931 when Hedley Finlayson found a thriving colony of them. He made multiple returns, but after a few years, the population disappeared. The last confirmed record of the species came in 1935 from near Ooroowilanie, east of Lake Eyre. Caloprymnus campestris was well- adapted to the extremely barren and arid regions it inhabited; these traits saved it from competition by introduced species like the European rabbit or domestic sheep. However, as early as the 1930s, the red fox had spread to the areas inhabited by the desert rat kangaroo. Thus, the rapid decline of the desert rat-kangaroo began shortly after its recovery in 1931 correlates with the invasion of its habitat by the red fox. Predation by the red fox and feral cats, as well as variable seasonal patterns and overhunting by indigenous Australians, were blamed for the extinction of this species. No reliable reports of the species have been made since 1935, but unconfirmed sightings in Queensland followed periods of rain in 1956-1957 and 1974-1975. Also, recent remains of this species have been found in the mid-1980s inside caves. The desert rat-kangaroo was declared extinct in 1994, making it the only mammal species to be rediscovered and then lost again. =Possible survival= In view of its amazing recovery following a 90-year period when it was not seen, the extinction of the desert rat-kangaroo is not certain; thus, sightings of this animal would not fall into the cryptozoology category. In similar cases, the broad-faced potoroo was last seen in the late 19th century and is considered extinct, Gilbert's potoroo was considered extinct for 120 years prior to its rediscovery in 1994, and the long-footed potoroo was only discovered in 1967. The finding of recent remains in the 1980s casts some doubt on the extinction of this species. Professor Ronald Nowak stated in his 2005 book, \\"perhaps a small population still survives, awaiting the time when it again may increase in response to proper conditions.\\" =2011 Peake Station sighting= An animal was sighted in May 2011 off Peake Station and subsequently identified from a museum skin as a desert rat-kangaroo. The area was then surveyed in August the same year. An old nest with some small macropod like scats was found and some tracks were also found near a waterhole that might have been made by the desert rat-kangaroo. However DNA analysis of the scats failed to yield any usable DNA. No DNA was found in dingo and cat scats in the area as well. As such the sighting remains unconfirmed, but researchers Tony Robinson and Tiana Forrrest confirmed the possibility \\"that a small population of Caloprymnus, generally considered to be extinct throughout its former range across the Lake Eyre Basin, may have been present in this area in May 2011\\".

Essentially, it says: As a result, all vessels have engaged in the coastwise trade have been required to be coastwise-qualified (i.e., U.S.-built, owned, and documented). Under the Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886 (46 USC ¬ß 55103), non-coastwise-qualified vessels cannot transport passengers directly between U.S. ports. Generally, a passenger is any person carried on a vessel who is not directly and substantially connected with the operation of such vessel, its navigation, ownership, or business. The precise definition of what constitutes a U.S. port (\\"coastwise point\\") includes artificial islands and similar structures, as well as to mobile oil drilling rigs, drilling platforms, and other devices attached to the seabed of the Outer Continental Shelf for the purpose of resource exploration operations, and the anchored warehouse vessels that supply drilling platforms. The handful of U.S.-flagged cruise ships in operation are registered in the U.S. to permit cruises between the Hawaiian Islands, or from the continental U.S. to Hawaii. The Passenger Vessel Services Act, however, * does not prohibit foreign-flagged ships departing from and returning to the same U.S. port, provided the ship visits any foreign port; * does not prohibit foreign-flagged ships departing from a U.S. port, visiting a distant foreign port, and then continuing to a second U.S. port. However, in order to embark in a U.S. port and disembark in a second U.S. port, the vessel must visit a distant foreign port outside of North America (Central America, Bermuda, the Bahamas, and all of the Caribbean except Aruba, Bonaire, and Cura√ßao, count as part of North America); In accordance with this law, cruise lines that operate foreign-flagged vessels are fined $778 for each passenger who boarded such a vessel in one U.S. port and left the vessel at another port. The cruise lines typically pass this cost on the passengers who \\"jump the ship\\". Exemptions are available in the case of family emergencies etc. Exceptions Some exceptions have been made to the requirement of the Passenger Services Act. For example, Canadian vessels may transport passengers between Rochester, New York and Alexandria Bay, New York until such time as a U.S. carrier enters the market (46 USC ¬ß 55121(a)), and between ports in southeastern Alaska (46 USC ¬ß 55121(b)). As of October 30, 2003, foreign vessels are also allowed to transport passengers (but not cargo) between the U.S. mainland and Puerto Rico (46 USC ¬ß 55104). However, this exemption will disappear if U.S.-flagged ships resume passenger operations of this type. Waivers from the PVSA can be requested in case of national-defense interest. Inter-island transportation in Hawaii MS Pride of America, one of NCL America's U.S.-flagged ships, not required to call on foreign ports. The law has had an interesting consequence with regard to the cruise-ship industry within the state of Hawaii. Foreign-flagged cruise ships may carry passengers between ports in the Hawaiian Islands as long as no passenger permanently leaves the vessel at ports other than the origination port and the vessel makes at least one call at a foreign port. Norwegian Cruise Line created a subsidiary, NCL America, and introduced three new U.S.-flagged vessels: Pride of Aloha in 2004, Pride of America in 2005, and Pride of Hawaii in 2006. Previously, with its foreign-flagged vessels, NCL needed to include a four-day detour to Tabuaeran (Fanning Atoll) in the Line Islands (Republic of Kiribati) on its Hawaiian itineraries. Reportedly due to financial losses, in 2007 NCL renamed Pride of Hawaii to Norwegian Jade, and reflagged and relocated the ship to Europe. In 2008, NCL also relocated Pride of Aloha to Florida, reflagging it and renaming it to Norwegian Sky at the same time. Thus the Pride of America is the sole NCL ship currently in Hawaii service.

He wasn't nominated until two weeks after the start of the election. During the campaign he said the major issues were lack of approvals for expanding schools and rising property taxes. He defeated Liberal incumbent Bill Ballinger by 1,230 votes. After the election he promised to clean up pollution in Lake Simcoe and Musselman Lake. He was appointed as Parliamentary assistant to the Minister of the Environment, Ruth Grier. In 1991, he argued against a proposal to create a garbage dump in the Durham region. He suggested that York region was the only viable option. Later in the year, he defended the NDP's legislation called the Waste Management Act saying that it was a reasonable compromise to handle the problem of finding a place for Toronto's garbage. The NDP were defeated in the 1995 provincial election, having lost much of their support base in the Greater Toronto Area. O'Connor finished second in his re-election bid, with 8,048 votes, almost 17,000 votes behind Progressive Conservative Julia Munro.

Polynesia is made of multiple islands that includes Hawaii, New Zealand, Samoa, among others within the Pacific Ocean. These voyagers developed Hawaiian cuisine, Hawaiian art, and the Native Hawaiian religion. Hula The original Hula dance originates from Polynesians who voyaged to the Hawaiian Islands, landing on the Hawaiian Islands and further developing the native Hula dance. Hula falls into two categories which are Hula Auana and Hula Kahiko. Hula Auana is Hula that was changed by Western influences and performed with musical instruments that do not originate from the Hawaiian Islands. Hula Kahiko is the original Hula dance which was refined before any outside influence. The Merrie Monarch Festival was created to honor King David KalƒÅkaua, who was the last reigning king of Hawaii. He was known for bringing Hula back to the Hawaiian Islands after the United States missionaries arrived. The annual competition held in Hilo brings Hula Halau from all over the world to compete and show their knowledge of Hawaiian culture. The Merrie Monarch Festival is nationally televised and teaches people all around the world about Hawaiian culture. Hawaiian outrigger canoe paddling Hawaiian Outrigger Canoe Paddling was not only the way that native Hawaiians discovered the Hawaiian Islands, it was a part of their everyday lifestyle. From paddling for leisure to traveling from island to island, it has been a tradition of the Native Hawaiian culture. As of the 21st century, Outrigger canoe paddling has become an international sport and educates people from all over the world about Hawaiian culture. Native Hawaiian cuisine When Polynesians first migrated to the Hawaiian Islands, almost no edible plants were available. When more people came to the Hawaiian Islands they brought many different plants so they would have food to eat. Polynesians also brought pigs, chickens, and dogs and bred them on the islands. The most important food eaten was taro, which was used to make poi; this was a big part of their everyday diet. Some common Hawaiian dishes include: Kalua pig, Lau-lau, Poke, Squid Luau, and Haupia. Traditional Hawaiian religion The traditional Hawaiian religion is a polytheistic animistic religion. Hawaiians believe that there are spirits in many objects such as the waves and the sky. The Hawaiian religion believes in four gods; KƒÅne, Kanaloa, K≈´, and Lono. KƒÅne is the God of creation, Kanaloa is the God of the ocean, Ku is the God of war and male pursuits, and Lono is the God of peace, rain, and fertility. They also believe in forty male gods (ka hƒÅ), four hundred gods and goddesses (ke kanahƒÅ), the spirits (na ‚Äòunihipili), and the guardians (na ‚ÄòaumƒÅkua). The Hawaiian religion is protected under the American Indian Religious Freedom Act.  (ho-o-pono-pono) is a cultural practice of reconciliation and forgiveness, usually combined with prayer. Similar forgiveness practices were performed on islands throughout the South Pacific, including Samoa, Tahiti and New Zealand. It is used in spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical healing practices. Traditional Hawaiian philosophy does not consider the physical and non-physical aspects of the world to be separate, therefore, to heal one aspect, all must be healed. Conversely, healing one will help to heal the rest. For example, if a person has an upset stomach, healing anger toward a sibling may also help to heal the stomach. Modern versions of may also contain elements of Christian belief and ritual. A session of is generally guided. Western contact, colonization and immigration In the 1830s, interactions between Hawaii and other western cultures such as Mexicans, Portuguese and Spanish began. During the 1850s, Hawaiian culture was progressively influenced by western cultures. Cultural interaction consisted of incorporating useful items into each other's daily lives. Prior to the arrival of western cultures, Hawaiian music was called Mele, Mele includes poems, songs, or chants that were passed down through generations. When the Portuguese, Mexicans, and Spanish landed on the Hawaiian Islands, they brought musical instruments such as the ukulele and the guitar and taught Hawaiians how to play these instruments. Hawaiians were in a difficult place due to the fact that they were becoming influenced by different cultures. The end of the 19th century was burdened with internal struggles since Hawaiians wanted to protect their culture and keep power over their land. When missionaries from the United States arrived in Hawaii in 1820, they found it difficult to understand Hawaiian culture and had very negative opinions about their culture. This led to the oppression of Hawaiian culture during the early 20th century. The cultural oppression of Hawaiians was evident from the banning of Hula dancing and other Hawaiian arts such as the language, the use of paddling, and music. Hawaiian children were sent to missionary schools where they were taught the English language. Missionaries institutionalized the English language by teaching it to children and making it the language of doing business and working in the government. In 1898 United States Congress passed the ‚ÄúNewlands Resolution‚Äù it was signed into law by President McKinley on July 7, 1898. Sixty-one years later in 1959, the Hawaiian Islands were recognized as the 50th state of the United States. At the height of the Hawaiian population there were an estimated 683,000 Native Hawaiians on the island. By the year 1900 the population had dropped to below 100,000 due to disease. Hawaiians have also been reduced to 20% of resident population die to disease, inter-marriage and immigration. A huge factor of the decline of Native Hawaiians consisted of the spread of diseases from outside Hawaii such as smallpox, cholera, influenza, and gonorrhea.  Native Hawaiians today  Today's Hawaii is more diverse since becoming a state; there are not as many pure-blooded native Hawaiians left. Ever since Captain James Cook discovered Hawaii many Native Hawaiians have died due to all the new diseases exposed to them. Many Native Hawaiians are homeless or impoverished. In 2016, there are studies from the Department of Housing and Urban Development saying 42% of Hawaii is homeless and most of the homeless are Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. Hawaii's culture may have faded a little, but the culture is still living and beautiful place to see. Natives still there practice cultural Hula and Luau celebrations, but it is more for tourism and showing off the Hawaiians' culture for economic gains. On average about 220,000 tourists go to Hawaii per day according to studies in 2016. Hawaiiana Hawaiiana is a popular term of academia used in reference to history and various aspects of the culture of Hawaii, currently a region and state of the United States. The term is used especially in reflection of the periods of antiquity and the Kingdom of Hawaii era. Hawaiiana has become increasingly popular among students of history and sociology throughout the world. The principal repository of Hawaiiana is the Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum in Honolulu on the island of Oahu. The institution is also called the Hawaii State Museum of Natural and Cultural History and often shares artifacts and information with other institutions globally for research and study. The term \\"Hawaiiana\\" was coined in 1948 by Hawaiian entertainer and cultural expert, Nona Beamer. Commercialization Polynesian dancers performing near Waikiki beach, on Oahu. Erica Lee and Melissa Gan, writing for The Sheaf, discussed the appropriation of Hawaiian culture by non-Hawaiian students and the stigma that comes from the criticism of appropriation. They criticized the oversimplification of the culture. In 1919 David and Lydia Bray and a group of young girls gathered before a court of Hawaiians who had power behind their names. They performed a traditional Hula dance. The judges deemed the presentation as nothing more than a cultural dance. It wasn't until the 1930s that Americans came into contact with Hawaiians after annexing their land. Contact between the Hawaiian Islands and the United States began through the use of live performances. Hawaiian women came to America and danced a westernized version of Hula which created an ‚Äúimagined intimacy‚Äù between Americans and Hawaiians. Americans felt a true connection to the Hawaiian culture, however, Hawaiians were upset about their land being annexed by the United States and wanted no part of American culture. Hawaiians didn't see this representation of their Native Hula dance as true Hula. America has portrayed a false Hawaiian lifestyle by using outside influences such as Hollywood movies, music, and marketing. Corporate companies have gone through a lot of trouble to make a profit from Hawaiian culture. For example, the traditional Luau was used to celebrate specific events such as weddings, birthdays, and graduations. Luaus have changed from a traditional party to paying a price to feel like a part of the Hawaiian culture. Traditional Luaus didn't include alcohol, island buffets, or performances. They also didn't happen every day of the week. Americans westernized the native Hawaiian Luau to create profit from tourists coming to Hawaii for an unfamiliar experience. Many native Hawaiians now make a living from tourists coming to the islands and pretending that the Luaus performed every night are native.

He was the governor of the province of P√°nuco from 1525 to 1533 and of Nueva Galicia from 1529 to 1534, President of the first Royal Audiencia of Mexico (High Court) from 1528 to 1530. He founded several cities in Northwestern Mexico, including Guadalajara. Originally a bodyguard of Charles V of Spain, he was sent to Mexico to counterbalance the influence of the leader of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Hern√°n Cort√©s, since the King worried he was becoming too powerful. As Governor of P√°nuco, Guzm√°n cracked down hard on the supporters of Cort√©s, stripping him and his supporters of property and rights. He conducted numerous expeditions of conquest into the northwestern areas of Mexico, enslaving thousands of Indians and shipping them to the Caribbean colonies. In the resulting power struggles where he also made himself an enemy of important churchmen, Guzm√°n came out the loser. In 1537, he was arrested for treason, abuse of power and mistreatment of the indigenous inhabitants of his territories, and he was sent to Spain in shackles. His subsequent reputation, in scholarship and popular discourse, has been that of a cruel, violent and irrational tyrant. His legacy has partly been colored by the fact that history was written largely by his political opponents such as Hern√°n Cort√©s, Juan de Zum√°rraga and Vasco de Quiroga. Early life Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n was born ca. 1485 in Guadalajara, Spain, to an old noble family. His father was Hern√°n Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n, a wealthy merchant and a High Constable in the Spanish Inquisition; his mother was Do√±a Magdalena de Guzm√°n.Robert Himmerich y Valencia. The Encomenderos of New Spain, 1521-1555. Austin: University of Texas Press 1991, p. 170. The Guzm√°n family supported Prince Charles in the Revolt of the Comuneros and achieved gratitude of the later Emperor. Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n received some experience in law, but never finished a degree.Chipman 1967: 59 -65 For a period he and his younger brother served as one of 100 royal bodyguards of Carlos V, and he accompanied the Emperor on a trip to Flanders in 1522, and undertook sensitive diplomatic missions, including one dealing with the Bishop of Cuenca (Spain).Himmerich y Valencia, Encomenderos of New Spain, p. 170.  Governorship of P√°nuco  In 1525 the Spanish crown appointed him governor of the autonomous territory of P√°nuco on the Gulf Coast in what is now northeast Mexico, arriving to take up the appointment in May 1527.Robert Himmerich y Valencia, The Encomenderos of New Spain, p. 170. He traveled with Lu√≠s Ponce de Leon and arrived in Hispaniola in 1526, but here he fell sick and did not arrive in Mexico until May 1527, immediately assuming his post.Krippner-Martinez 2001:50The discrepancy between the dates of arrival in various sources is resolved by Chipman 1967:143-144 Cort√©s had already extended his reach into P√°nuco, so that Guzm√°n's appointment was a direct challenge. His appointment was opposed by the Pro-Cort√©s faction of the struggle for power in early colonial Mexico, who viewed him as an outsider with no military experience.Himmerich y Valencia, The Encomenderos of New Spain, p. 170. But he had the support of the Council of Indies and the Spanish Crown who saw him as a counterbalance to the figure of Cort√©s whose aspirations to power worried the King of Spain. Guzm√°n's appointment gave heart to Spanish conquerors who had not received what they considered sufficient rewards from Cort√©s's distribution of encomiendas and to Spanish settlers who had not participated in the conquest but saw their paths to position and wealth blocked by the Cort√©s faction.Himmerich y Valencia, The Encomenderos of New Spain, p. 170 Guzm√°n's rule as a governor of P√°nuco was stern against Spanish rivals and brutal against the Indians. He stroke down harshly against Cort√©s's supporters in P√°nuco, accusing some of them of disloyalty to the Crown by backing Cort√©s's claim to the title of viceroy. Some were stripped of their property; others were tried and executed. He also incorporated territory from adjacent provinces into the province of P√°nuco. These actions brought New Spain on the verge of a civil war between Guzm√°n and supporters of Cort√©s' led by Governor of New Spain Alonso de Estrada, when Estrada sent an expedition to reclaim the lands expropriated by Guzm√°n. During the court case against Cort√©s in 1529, Guzm√°n accused Cort√©s himself of being a traitor and a rebel. Bishop Juan de Zum√°rraga, who had traveled with Guzm√°n to Hispaniola, in turn accused Guzm√°n of being allied with the governor of Cuba, Diego Vel√°zquez and having been a sworn enemy of Cort√©s even before setting foot in New Spain.Chipman 1967:149-54 As governor Guzm√°n instituted a system of Indian slave trade in P√°nuco. During a raid along R√≠o de Las Palmas in 1528 he allowed every horseman to take 20 Indian slaves and each footman 15. In 1529 he gave out individual slaving permissions amounting to more than 1000 slaves. Initially Guzm√°n did not allow Spaniards to sell slaves for export except in exchange for livestock, but later he gave more than 1500 slave licenses (each permitting the taking of between 15 and 50 slaves) in an eight-month period.Chipman 1967:225 The slaving operation in P√°nuco expanded when Guzm√°n became President of the Royal Audiencia of Mexico and he had Indian slaves smuggled into P√°nuco and shipped on to the Caribbean.Chipman 1967:225 Indian slaves were branded on the face. Taking Indian slaves was not explicitly outlawed in the period before 1528. Beginning in 1528, Indian slaving operations came under increased royal control but were not prohibited. The regulations of September 19, 1528, required slave owners to present proof of the legality of the taking of any slaves before branding. In 1529 the Crown began an investigation into the slaving enterprises of Guzm√°n. In spite of his lack of success as governor, in 1529 he was appointed President of the First Audiencia, which the Council of the Indies and the Crown instated to check the ventures of industrious private individuals, such as Cort√©s, in New Spain. As President of the Real Audiencia In the years following the conquest of Central Mexico by Hern√°n Cort√©s, New Spain had been governed by a military government, generally with the objectives of maximizing personal economic gains by the Spanish conquistadors. Hoping to establish a more orderly government, to reduce the authority of Cort√©s, and secure the authority of the Spanish crown in the New World, on December 13, 1527 the metropolitan government of Charles V in Burgos named the Real Audiencia de M√©xico to take over the government of the colony. This Audiencia consisted of a president and four oidores (judges). Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n was named president. His oidores were Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, Diego Delgadillo, Diego Maldonado and Alonso de Parada; these two last fell sick during the voyage to New Spain and died shortly after arrival. At the time Guzm√°n was serving as governor of P√°nuco, so Charles ordered the judges to assemble in Veracruz and from there make a joint entrance into the capital. The four from Spain, however, did not wait for the arrival of Guzm√°n, and proceeded directly to the capital. They arrived on December 8, 1528, taking over the government on the following day. They were given a splendid reception by the city government. Guzm√°n arrived a few days after the others. The first bishop of Mexico, Juan de Zum√°rraga, had arrived in the capital only a few days before the oidores. The instructions given to the Audiencia included a recommendation for good treatment of the indigenous people and a directive that the investigation into the conduct of Cort√©s and his associates Pedro de Alvarado, Alonso de Estrada, Rodrigo de Albornoz, Gonzalo de Salazar and Pedro Alm√≠ndez Chirino be concluded within 90 days. Most of these associates had participated in the government in the proceeding few years while Cort√©s was in Honduras, with a lot of in-fighting among themselves and injustices to the population, both Spanish and Indigenous. Cort√©s himself was now in Spain, where he was defending his conduct and appealing his loss of authority to Charles. Cort√©s had some success with his appeal, being named Marqu√©s del Valle de Oaxaca and receiving some other honors. Nevertheless, Guzm√°n was now in charge in New Spain. Among his official acts was placing plaques bearing the royal coat of arms on the principal buildings of the capital, to stress that sovereignty resided in the king, not in Cort√©s. He had Pedro de Alvarado arrested for questioning the loyalty of Gonzalo de Salazar. There was already some animosity between Cort√©s and Guzm√°n, because the former had been reluctant to recognize the latter as governor of P√°nuco. The later events made the two enemies. The Audiencia also banned direct communication with the court in Spain. This was so effective that Bishop Zum√°rraga felt the necessity of hiding a letter sealed in wax in a cask, to be smuggled to the Spanish authorities by a confederate sailor. In 1530, upon Hern√°n Cort√©s' return to New Spain, Guzm√°n was removed from the office of President of the Audiencia and instead appointed governor of Nueva Galicia. As governor of Nueva Galicia he continued his politics of violent submission of the Indians of the Gran Chichimeca and came into conflict with church authorities such as Juan de Zum√°rraga, the Bishop appointed as Protector of the Indians, and Bishop of Michoac√°n Vasco de Quiroga. He also founded several cities that still exist such as Zacatecas, Quer√©taro and Guadalajara. In 1531 Zum√°rraga published a treatise decrying Guzm√°n's 1529 campaign as unjust. Guzm√°n, who had by then made many enemies, fell out of favor with the authorities and the Second Audiencia. In 1533 he was removed from the Governorship of P√°nuco and in 1534 of that of Nueva Galicia. In 1537 he was charged with treason, jailed and later expelled from New Spain.Rojinsky 2010:236 As conqueror of western Mexico In 1529, Guzm√°n put Juan Ortiz de Matienzo in charge of the Audiencia. Then, gathering a military force of 300 to 400 discontented conquistadors and between 5,000 and 8,000 indigenous Nahua allies, Guzm√°n set out on December 21, 1529, to the west of Mexico City to conquer lands and peoples who until then had resisted the conquest.Krippner- Martinez 2001:56 Among the officers on this expedition was Pedro Alm√≠ndez Chirino. The campaign started with the torture and execution of the Pur√©pecha cazonci Tang√°xuan II, a powerful indigenous ally of the Spanish Crown. Guzm√°n proceeded to launch a fierce campaign into the Chichimec lands in the province that was to become known as Nueva Galicia, reaching as far as Culiac√°n. Part of the purpose of the expedition was to find the fabled Cibola, the Seven Cities of Gold.Krippner-Martinez 2001:99 This expedition has been described as a \\"genocidal enterprise\\".David E. Stannard, American Holocaust: The Conquest of the New World, New York: Oxford University Press US, 1993, p. 81. Typically, the conquistadors attacked an Indian village, stole the maize and other food, razed and burned the dwellings, and tortured the native leaders to gather information on what riches could be stolen there, or from nearby populations. For the most part, these riches did not exist. As an example, the Spanish were received peaceably in Tzintzuntzan by Tang√°xuan II, the cazonci of the Tarascan state, which largely coincides with the modern state of Michoac√°n. Tang√°xuan gave Guzm√°n presents of gold and silver and supplied him with soldiers and provisions. Nevertheless, Guzm√°n had him arrested and tortured, to get him to reveal the location of hidden stores of gold. Presumably there was no more gold, because Tang√°xuan did not reveal it under torture. Guzm√°n had him dragged by a horse and then burned alive on February 14, 1530. Meanwhile, in Mexico City, the actions of the Audiencia attracted the attention of Juan de Zum√°rraga, bishop of Mexico, who put it under an ecclesiastical interdiction on March 7, 1530. The immediate cause of the interdiction was a case of violation of sanctuary. The Audiencia had violently taken from the convent of San Francisco a servant of Cort√©s accused of grave crimes, and two religious, Crist√≥bal de Angulo and Garc√≠a de Llerena. Undeterred, Guzm√°n continued the violent suppression on the peoples of the present-day states of Jalisco, Zacatecas, Nayarit and Sinaloa. In the latter state, he founded the city of San Miguel de Culiac√°n on September 29, 1531. He returned to Tepic, where he set up his headquarters, sending out new expeditions from there. One of these founded the cities of Santiago de Galicia de Compostela and Purificaci√≥n. Another traveled as far as the current Mexican state of Sonora. His violent expeditions into Chichimec lands were a main cause of the Mixt√≥n rebellion. Foundation of Guadalajara in New Spain In 1531 (probably January), one of Guzm√°n's captains, Crist√≥bal de O√±ate, founded a small town near Nochistl√°n to which the name \\"Guadalajara\\" was given. Two years later Guzm√°n visited the city, and at the request of its inhabitants, who were fearful of Indian attacks and lacked sufficient water, he ordered it moved to Tonal√°. This occurred on May 24, 1533. Later, after Guzm√°n had returned to Spain, it was moved again, to a site near Tlacotan (northeast of modern Zapopan). This occurred probably between October 1541 and February of the following year. Later the settlers began to complain to Antonio de Mendoza, then the viceroy of New Spain, about both the repeated relocations and Guzm√°n's cruelty. Kingdom of New Galicia Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n gave the name \\"Conquista del Esp√≠ritu Santo de la Mayor Espa√±a\\" to the territories he explored and conquered. However, the queen of Spain, Joanna of Castile, mother of Charles V, did not approve of the name. By a royal decree dated January 25, 1531, she supplied the name Reino de Nueva Galicia (Kingdom of New Galicia). This territory extended from the Rio Lerma to Sonora, with its capital at Compostela. New Galicia was a separate entity, not under the authority of the Audiencia of Mexico City (but still part of New Spain). One nineteenth-century chronicler of the Conquest referred to Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n as \\"the detestable governor of P√°nuco and perhaps the most depraved man ever to set foot in New Spain.\\"Vicente Riva Palacio. M√©xico a trav√©s de los siglos, Vol. II, (Barcelona: Espasa, 1991 [1880]) cited in Dijes Ant√≥n, Juan and Manuel Sagredo y Mart√≠n. Biograf√≠as de hijos ilustres de la Provincia de Guadalajara. (Guadalajara, Spain, 1889), 45. Keep in mind that Dijes and Sagredo write, \\"It truly jumps to our attention that Riva Palacio starts, as soon as he commences his account of Nu√±o, to use at every step a unique language, applying to him the harshest expressions in the Castilian tongue, language not used with any other, which leaves him open to our attempt to refute him.\\" (43) They point out that the other chroniclers of the period‚Äîamong them Bernal D√≠az and Francisco L√≥pez de G√≥mara mention very little about Guzm√°n, and what they say is positive. They conclude that Rivas Palacio could have made use of the unpublished sources of the Archives of the Indies to come up with his different account. Fray Bartolom√© de las Casas called him a \\"great tyrant\\". Final years in Spain Reports of Guzm√°n's treatment of the Indigenous had reached Mexico City and Spain, and, at Bishop Zum√°rraga's request the Crown sent Diego P√©rez de la Torre to investigate. Guzm√°n was arrested in 1536. He was held a prisoner for more than a year and then sent to Spain in fetters. He was released from the Castle of Torrej√≥n prison in 1538. In 1539 he returned to his position as royal contino bodyguard - court records show him on the payroll every year from 1539 to 1561 (in 1561 as \\"deceased\\"). In 1552 he wrote up a memorial containing his own version of the events leading to his fall. In his account he justified his execution of the Pur√©pecha Cazonci as being necessary in order to bring a Christian rule of law to the area, and he assured that: \\"in truth no execution more just has been carried out in all of New Spain, and if I were deserving of any punishment it would be for having doubted some days about whether to carry it out.\\"Rojinsky 2010:238 (translated from the Spanish: \\"cierto ninguna se ha hecho m√°s justa en toda la Nueva Espa√±a; y si yo alguna pena podia merecer es porque dud√© algunos d√≠as de hacerla\\"\\") In 1558 he wrote his last will which was uncovered in 1973, it shows him as a poverty stricken noble struggling to save his heirs from his debts, having had even to pawn his heirlooms to pay for medicine. In it, he requested some of the property that was confiscated from him to be returned to his heirs, and wages still due to him for his years as Governor and President be paid and turned over to his heirs. With affection he bequeathed most of his belongings to a woman Sabina de Guzm√°n, who had taken care of him in his illness. He also bequeathed belongings to the Franciscan Order, in spite of the conflicts he had had with its members in New Spain.Chipman 1978 He probably died in Valladolid in 1558 on October 16 or shortly thereafter.Chipman 1967:280-81 Reputation In posteriority and partly in his own time Nu√±o de Guzm√°n achieved a reputation as the worst villain of the conquistadors, in the words of his biographer Donald Chipman he has been depicted as the \\"personification of the Black Legend\\".Chipman 1967:141 His contemporary Bernal D√≠az del Castillo, one of Cort√©s' loyal supporters, described him in the following terms: \\"...

As the line had a federal charter, the operating company continues to be used to operate the Ontario Northland Railway freight spur line between Swastika, Ontario and Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, avoiding the need to re-charter either end in its respective provinces. History In 1902 the Ontario government chartered the Temiskaming & Northern Ontario Railway (T&NO;) to connect the towns of New Liskeard and Haileybury on Lake Temiskaming to North Bay on Lake Nipissing. During construction, silver ore was discovered near the Mile 103 post, just southwest of Haileybury. The Cobalt Silver Rush followed, leading to the incorporation of the town of Cobalt in 1906, and a swelling population reaching 10 to 15,000 by 1911. As the population of all of the towns grew, the need for better transportation between them also grew. The Nipissing Central Railway was granted a federal (Dominion) charter on 12 April 1907, and opened the first portion of the line between Cobalt and Haileybury on 30 April 1910. The route followed King Street out of Cobalt, turning onto the city streets of what is today's North Cobalt (the outskirts of Haileybury) and turning downtown before ending at Main Street in Haileybury. The line was purchased by the T&NO; on 20 June 1911. An extension along Lake Timiskaming to New Liskeard opened on 1 November 1912, ending at Whitewood Avenue. In 1914, an existing spur line on the T&NO; to Kerr Lake was electrified and joined to the NCR. This section was abandoned in 1924. Interurban operations on the NCR ended on 9 February 1935. When the T&NO; built a spur line between Swastika and Rouyn-Noranda, they operated it under the charter of the NCR, thereby avoiding problems with crossing the provincial border (the T&NO; was incorporated in Ontario). The company exists to this day as the operator of the T&NO; spur. The construction of the line was the subject of a legal challenge, The Attorney-General of Quebec v. The Nipissing Central Railway Company and another; it was decided in favour of the railway by the Privy Council in London in 1926 References * \\"The Rise and Fall of a Mining Camp\\", Cobalt Mining Legacy * \\"Argentite Ghost Town\\", Ontario Abandoned Places * George Hilton and John Due, \\"The Electric Interurban Railways in America\\", Stanford University Press, 2000, p. 420 Category:Ontario railways Category:Quebec railways Category:Street railways in Canada Category:Interurban railways in Ontario Temiskaming Category:Railway companies established in 1907 Category:Ontario Northland Railway ","title":"Nipissing Central Railway"},{"id":"1624839","text":"Wallace \\"Wally\\" Feurzeig (June 10, 1927 ‚Äì January 4, 2013) was an American computer scientist who was co-inventor, with Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon, of the programming language Logo, and a well-known researcher in artificial intelligence (AI).  Early life and education  Wallace Feurzeig was born in Chicago to parents Mandel and Pauline Feurzeig. He earned Bachelor of Philosophy and Bachelor of Science degrees from the University of Chicago, and a Master of Science degree from the Illinois Institute of Technology. He worked at Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago before joining Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN).  Career  During the early 1960s, Bolt, Beranek and Newman had become a major center of computer science research and innovative applications. In 1962, Wally Feurzeig joined the firm to work with its newly available facilities in the Artificial Intelligence Department, one of the earliest AI organizations. His colleagues were actively engaged in some of the pioneering AI work in computer pattern recognition, natural-language understanding, automated theorem proving, Lisp language development, and robot problem solving. Much of this work was done in collaboration with distinguished researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) such as Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy, who were regular BBN consultants during the early 1960s. Other groups at BBN were doing original work in cognitive science, instructional research and man-computer communication. Some of the first work on knowledge representation and reasoning (semantic networks), question answering, interactive computer graphics, and computer-aided instruction (CAI) was actively underway. J. C. R. Licklider was the spiritual and scientific leader of much of this work, championing the cause of on-line interaction during an era when almost all computing was being done via batch processing. Wally's initial focus was on expanding the intellectual abilities of extant teaching systems. This led to the first intelligent CAI system, MENTOR, which employed production rules to support problem-solving interactions in medical diagnosis and other decision- making domains. In 1965, Wally organized the BBN Educational Technology Department to further the development of computer methods to improve learning and teaching, and the focus of his work then shifted to investigating programming languages as educational environments. This shift was partly due to two recent technological advances: the invention of computer time-sharing and the development of the first high-level conversational programming language. The idea of sharing a computer's cycles among autonomous users, working simultaneously, had stirred the imagination in Cambridge in 1963 and 1964. BBN and MIT teams raced to be first to realize this concept, with BBN winning by days and holding the first successful demonstration of computer time-sharing in 1964. BBN's initial system, designed by Sheldon Boilen, supported five simultaneous users on a DEC PDP-1, all sharing one cathode-ray tube (CRT) screen for output. Seeing dynamic displays from several distinct programs, simultaneously and asynchronously (\\"out of time and tune\\"), was a breathtaking experience. Time sharing made feasible the economic use of remote distributed terminals and opened up the possibilities of interactive computer use in schools. BBN had recently implemented TELCOMP, one of the new breed of high-level interactive programming languages. TELCOMP was a dialect of JOSS, the first conversational or interpreted language, developed in 1962‚Äì63 by Cliff Shaw of the RAND Corporation. Its syntax was similar to that of the language BASIC, which had not yet appeared. Like BASIC, TELCOMP was a FORTRAN- derived language originally designed for numerical computational applications. Shortly after TELCOMP was created, Wally decided to introduce it to children as a tool to teach mathematics and in 1965‚Äì66, under U.S. Office of Education support, explored its use as an auxiliary resource in eight elementary and secondary schools served by the BBN time-sharing system. Students were introduced to TELCOMP and then worked on standard arithmetic, algebra, and trigonometry problems by writing TELCOMP programs. The project strongly confirmed expectations that the use of interactive computation with a high- level interpretive language would be highly motivating to students. Wally's collaborators in this research were Daniel Bobrow, Richard Grant, and Cynthia Solomon from BBN and consultant Seymour Papert, who had recently arrived at MIT from Jean Piaget's Institute in Geneva. The idea of a programming language expressly designed for children arose directly from this project. The group realized that most extant languages were designed for doing computation and that they generally lacked facilities for nonnumeric symbolic manipulation. Current languages were inappropriate for education in other respects also: they often employed extensive data type declarations that got in the way of students' expressive impetus; they had serious deficiencies in control structures; their programs lacked procedural constructs; most had no facilities for dynamic definition and execution; few had well-developed and articulate debugging, diagnostic and editing facilities, so essential for educational uses.

Overview The Color of Pomegranates is a biography of the Armenian ashug Sayat-Nova (King of Song) that attempts to reveal the poet's life visually and poetically rather than literally. The film is presented with little dialogue using active tableaux which depict the poet's life in chapters: Childhood, Youth, Prince's Court (where he falls in love with a tsarina), The Monastery, The Dream, Old Age, The Angel of Death and Death. There are sounds and music and occasional singing but dialogue is rare. Each chapter is indicated by a title card and framed through both Sergei Parajanov's imagination and Sayat Nova's poems. Actress Sofiko Chiaureli notably plays six roles in the film, both male and female. According to Frank Williams, Parajanov's film celebrates the survival of Armenian culture in face of oppression and persecution, \\"There are specific images that are highly charged‚Äîblood-red juice spilling from a cut pomegranate into a cloth and forming a stain in the shape of the boundaries of the ancient Kingdom of Armenia; dyers lifting hanks of wool out of vats in the colours of the national flag, and so on\\". Parajanov, the director, said his inspiration was \\"the Armenian illuminated miniature,\\" and that he \\"wanted to create that inner dynamic that comes from inside the picture, the forms and the dramaturgy of colour.\\" He also described this film as a series of Persian miniatures.The Color of Pomegranates¬∑Senses of Cinema His close friend Mikhail Vartanov has maintained that Parajanov's misunderstood cinematic language is \\"simple and only appears to be complex\\" and he partly demystified it in Parajanov: The Last Spring. Some Russian versions of The Color of Pomegranates have Special Edition features. The Memories of Sayat Nova, by Levon Grigoryan, is a 30-minute synopsis that explains what is happening in the tableaux and in each chapter of the poet's life. G. Smalley asserts that every carefully composed image in The Color of Pomegranates is coded to a meaning, but the key to interpreting them is missing. He agrees with Parajanov that \\"If someone sat down to watch The Color of Pomegranates with no background, they would have no idea what they were seeing.\\" The making of the film and its different versions are explored in the other special features: \\"Introduction\\" by writer and filmmaker Daniel Bird; The World Is A Window: Making The Colour of Pomegranates‚Äîa new documentary by Daniel Bird; and \\"Commentary\\" by Levon Abrahamyan, moderated by Daniel Bird.

All are medieval churches in the northern province of Lori. Locations in Georgia included the Alaverdi Monastery, the countryside surrounding the David Gareja monastery complex, and the Dzveli Shuamta complex near Telavi. Azerbaijani locations included the Old City of Baku and Nardaran Fortress. Censorship and release Soviet censors and Communist Party officials objected to Parajanov's stylized, poetic treatment of Sayat-Nova's life and complained that it failed to educate the public about the poet. As a result, the film's title was changed from Sayat-Nova to The Color of Pomegranates, and all references to Sayat-Nova's name were removed from the credits and chapter titles in the original Armenian release version. The Armenian writer Hrant Matevosyan wrote new, abstractly poetic Armenian- language chapter titles. Officials further objected to the film's abundance of religious imagery, although a great deal of religious imagery still remains in both surviving versions of the film. Initially the State Committee for Cinematography in Moscow refused to allow distribution of the film outside of Armenia. It premiered in Armenia in October 1969, with a running time of 77 minutes.Steffen, 131-132. The filmmaker Sergei Yutkevich, who had served as a reader for the script in the State Committee for Cinematography's Script Editorial board, recut the film slightly and created new Russian-language chapter titles in order to make the film easier to understand and more palatable to the authorities. In addition to cutting a few minutes' worth of footage‚Äîsome of it clearly due to its religious content‚Äîhe changed the order of some sequences. The film ultimately received only a limited release in the rest of the Soviet Union, in Yutkevich's 73-minute version.Steffen, 133. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 93% based on 15 retrospectively collected reviews, with an average rating of 7.09/10. In 1980 Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that \\"the film is elusive in any circumstances. However, anything this purely mysterious has its magic.\\" The Color of Pomegranates made the Top 10 list for 1982 in Cahiers du cin√©ma. Filmmaker Mikhail Vartanov has said, \\"Besides the film language suggested by Griffith and Eisenstein, the world cinema has not discovered anything revolutionarily new until The Color of Pomegranates, not counting the generally unaccepted language of the Andalusian Dog by Bu√±uel\\". According to Michelangelo Antonioni, \\"Parajanov's Color of Pomegranates is of a stunningly perfect beauty. Parajanov, in my opinion, is one of the best film directors in the world.\\" Film critic Gilbert Adair argued that \\"although in both style and content it gives us the impression, somehow, of predating the invention of the cinema, no historian of the medium who ignores The Color of Pomegranates can ever be taken seriously.\\" The work ranked 84th in the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll of the world's greatest films and appeared in another list of the greatest films by Time Out. Restoration In 2014 the film was digitally restored and re-edited to be as close as possible to the director‚Äôs original vision and world premiered at the 67th Cannes Film Festival. The US premiere took place on 20 September 2014 at The Academy at Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and was introduced by Martiros Vartanov. The East Coast premiere took place at the 52nd New York Film Festival on 2 October 2014, and was introduced by Scorsese. The restoration was completed by Martin Scorsese's Film Foundation in conjunction with Cineteca di Bologna, and was, described by critic and Toronto festival programmer James Quandt as \\"a cinematic Holy Grail\\". Martin Scorsese received the 2014 Parajanov-Vartanov Institute Award for the restoration of The Color of Pomegranates. A Blu-ray of the restoration was released in the UK on 19 February 2018, and an American release by Criterion with Mikhail Vartanov's 1969 documentary The Color of Armenian Land on 17 April 2018.

Most often, the term has been used for the consort of a prince, or for the daughter of a king or prince. Princess as a substantive title Princess Sigrid Vasa of Sweden (1566‚Äì1633)Sture Arnell: Karin M√•nsdotter, Wahlstr√∂m & Widstrand, Stockholm 1951.Lars-Olof Larsson (in Swedish): Arvet efter Gustav Vasa (The Inheritance of Gustav Vasa) Some princesses are reigning monarchs of principalities. There have been fewer instances of reigning princesses than reigning princes, as most principalities excluded women from inheriting the throne. Examples of princesses regnant have included Constance of Antioch, princess regnant of Antioch in the 12th century. Since the President of France, an office for which women are eligible, is ex-officio a Co-Prince of Andorra, then Andorra could theoretically be jointly ruled by a princess. Princess as a courtesy titleDescendants of monarchs= For many centuries, the title \\"princess\\" was not regularly used for a monarch's daughter, who, in English, might simply be called \\"Lady\\". Old English had no female equivalent of \\"prince\\", \\"earl\\", or any royal or noble title aside from queen. Royal women were simply addressed or referred to as \\"The Lady [Firstname]\\". For example, Elizabeth and Mary, daughters of Henry VIII of England, were often simply referred to as \\"the Ladies Elizabeth and Mary\\". This practice, however, was not consistent. In the marriage contract between Prince George of Denmark and Anne, daughter of James II of Great Britain, Anne is referred to as \\"The Princess Anne\\". Practice in Britain began to change in the 18th century. After the accession of King George I to the British throne, the children, grandchildren, and male-line great grandchildren of the British Sovereign were automatically titled \\"Prince or Princess of Great Britain and Ireland\\" and styled \\"Royal Highness\\" (in the case of children and grandchildren) or \\"Highness\\" (in the case of male line great grandchildren). Queen Victoria confirmed this practice in Letters Patent dated 30 January 1864 (the first Act of the Prerogative dealing with the princely title in general terms). On 31 December 2012, Queen Elizabeth II issued letters patent enabling all children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales to enjoy the princely title and style of Royal Highness, as opposed to only the eldest son. =Wives of princes= In European countries, a woman who marries a prince will almost always become a princess, but a man who marries a princess will almost never become a prince, unless specifically created so. From 1301 onward, the eldest sons of the Kings of England (and later Great Britain and the United Kingdom) have generally been created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, and their wives have been titled Princess of Wales. Queen Elizabeth II of United Kingdom issued Letters Patent dated 21 August 1996, stating that any woman divorced from a Prince of the United Kingdom would no longer be entitled to the style \\"Royal Highness\\". This has so far applied to Diana, Princess of Wales, and Sarah, Duchess of York. Similarly, in Denmark, Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg, lost her status as princess upon her divorce from Prince Joachim of Denmark; Queen Margrethe II bestowed instead upon her former daughter-in-law the additional personal title Countess of Frederiksborg ().

It was built as part of the Bicentennial Buildings complex that includes the Memorial Rotunda and the University Commons, designed by the firm Carr√®re and Hastings for the Yale bicentennial celebration in 1901. With approximately 2,650 seats, it is the university's largest auditorium and hosts concerts, performances, and university ceremonies including the annual freshman convocation, senior baccalaureate, and presidential inaugurations. The building is named for Theodore Dwight Woolsey, President of Yale from 1846 through 1871.\\"Teutonic Constitutionalism - the Role of Ethno-Juridical Discourse in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War\\", by Mark S. Weiner, in Foreign in a Domestic Sense: Puerto Rico, American Expansion, and the Constitution, edited by Christina Duffy Burnett and Burke Marshall; published June 29, 2001, by Duke University Press History During the 19th century, Yale became one of the largest higher education institutions in the world, establishing seven graduate and professional schools in addition to the undergraduate college founded in 1701. Although Yale was nominally organized as a university in 1887, its constituent schools remained mostly independent of the university administration, and they lacked any shared facilities. In 1896, as one of several initiatives to unify the new university, Yale President Timothy Dwight V proposed the construction of a central dining hall and auditorium, for which the university would need to raise $1.5 to $2 million. The task of construction fell to the administration of Arthur Twining Hadley, who became president 1899, two years before the university bicentennial. The position of the buildings was selected as a central node between the Old Campus of Yale College and the Sheffield Scientific School, positioning the new university buildings as separate from the dominant College and partial to no school in particular. Succeeding Battell Chapel as the university's largest assembly space, the new hall was the university's first secular auditorium, coinciding with Hadley's appointment as the first non- ordained person to lead the university. In 1910, a seat on the first balcony was made extra large to accommodate Yale's ultimate \\"big man on campus,\\" trustee and alumnus William Howard Taft. Design and features The architects were Carr√®re and Hastings, who a decade later designed the New York Public Library. Built in a Beaux Arts style that contrasted with the university's more somber Victorian Gothic revival taste in the late 19th century, the new building was considered by critics to be overreaching and gaudy. The ornately decorated hall is home to the Newberry Memorial Organ, one of the most renowned Symphonic organs in the world. This hall serves as the main performance venue for the New Haven Symphony Orchestra, the Yale Bands, the Yale Symphony Orchestra, the Yale Philharmonia, the Yale Glee Club, and many smaller, student-run ensembles such as a cappella singing groups. Woolsey Hall's murals represent the ideal of a classical education and include images on the nine muses and the goddess Athena. They reflect the age when Yale was an all-male college. The Hall is entered via the Memorial Rotunda, a vestibule containing memorials to sons of Yale who lost their lives in all American wars from the Revolutionary War to the Vietnam War. The hall's lack of draperies, carpeting and upholstered seats all contribute to its acoustics for organ performance, though the acoustics work far more in favor of the organ than for other sounds. Woolsey Hall predates any major studies within the field of acoustics, so aside from its large size, rectangular shape, hard surfaces and high vaulted ceiling, it has no peculiar architectural properties that contribute positively to its sound. Choral singers are sometimes hampered by Woolsey's muddy resonance, which easily obscures text and delicate timbres, and can also make it difficult to hear oneself on stage. Though Yale University's primary recital hall, it does lack modern amenities including: universal accessibility for people with disabilities, air conditioning, and industry-standard lighting.

Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom takes a different direction from the rest of the series, being more of a mix of real-time strategy and role-playing video game elements than the typical card battling games seen on other systems. The gameplay features a 3D battle stage including bonuses and improvements (such as fortresses, weapons, etc.) It features most of the major characters from the anime and manga series as well as 177 monsters. Plot At first the player can choose between two storylines, for Yugi Muto and Seto Kaiba, but later the player can get one for Joey Wheeler as well. The Yugi storyline involves Yugi, Joey, Tristan, T√©a and Bakura being invited to the testing of the virtual reality game \\"Kingdom,\\" created by the company SIC. When they enter the game they soon find themselves trapped within it, and they must summon the help of the game's characters and monsters in order to defeat the game's villain, Emperor Haysheen and ultimately stop the plans of the game's designer, Scott Irvine, to control the three Egyptian God cards. Along the way, the players faces Joey, Tea and Yami Bakura. Kaiba's storyline features Seto Kaiba and his brother Mokuba Kaiba, who are also trapped in the game. Initially they work for Emperor Haysheen, but Marthis, Kaiba's 'helper', hears Kaiba talking to Pegasus and suspects that Kaiba is a spy for the resistance. Marthis turns Kaiba in to the Emperor, who sentences him to a public execution. However, Kaiba escapes with Mokuba and Bonz. Marthis is waiting for him with a unit, and promises the man who brings Kaiba to him anything he wants. After defeating all enemies on the level, Pegasus arrives and asks Kaiba to lead the resistance, as he 'cannot return to the Empire' with a price on his head. Kaiba recruits further members for his resistance, including Weevil Underwood and Rex Raptor. A climactic plot event in both stories occurs when Mokuba is kidnapped, and Scott forces Kaiba to battle against Yugi. At the end of both storylines is a segment taking place within a secret room leading from the game's fantasy environment to the inner workings of the computer that is running the game itself. Either team must defeat Scott Irvine as well as the enemy DarkNite, wielder of one of the God Cards, Obelisk the Tormentor in Yugi's story, and Slifer the Sky Dragon in Kaiba's. After beating one story, the other storyline becomes harder, with higher level monsters. In this harder mode, there is an additional villain, , who has the God Card at level 99. Joey's storyline is a prequel to Yugi's and features some minor characters from the other storylines. Its main villain is Marik Ishtar who uses The Winged Dragon of Ra under Scott's manipulation. This storyline finishes with the character facing Kaiba, Mokuba, Marthis and 4 Marshals. Gameplay In the Falsebound Kingdom, the player controls an army of Marshals opposed to an army of enemy Marshals. Each warrior commands up to three Duel Monsters. Duel Monsters individually have Attack power and Defense power, and also have HP and AP, the latter representing how many turns they are able to take in battle. Monsters can take items into battle with them with various effects such as increasing their stats or recovery their health. Marshals have an affinity towards certain types of monsters, represented by a colored orb; the closer a monster's orb color is to a Marshal's, the higher that monsters stats will be. Continued service under a Marshal will gradually change a monster's affinity. Monsters can also have unique abilities or attacks with special mechanics, such as hitting multiple targets or doing extra damage to certain enemy types.Konami (2004), Yugioh The Falsebound Kingdom EU Instruction Booklet, pages 40-42 Players command their army of Marshals on a field against the enemy Marshals and advance them towards bases held by the other team. When two Marshals come in range of each other, their team of Duel Monsters fights. Whichever Marshal is victorious, they remain in their position on the map while the defeated Marshal is sent to the nearest allied base to slowly recover their strength. At allied bases the player can spend money to upgrade the base with facilities, including speeding up the healing rate of Marshals there or shops to purchase items. The objective is usually to push the player's allied forces to the enemy's central base and capture it. =Challenge Mode= The game also includes a Challenge Mode consisting entirely of battles, where the player has to fight various characters from the campaign, such as Joey, Kaiba, and Yugi.

Maritime Union () is a proposed political union of the three Maritime provinces of Canada ‚Äì New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island ‚Äì to form a single new province.\\"Senators revive Maritime union proposal\\". Toronto Star, November 30, 2012. This vision has sometimes been expanded to a proposed Atlantic Union, which would also include the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The idea has been proposed at various times throughout Canadian history. Most recently, it was reintroduced in November 2012 by Stephen Greene, John D. Wallace and Mike Duffy, three Conservative Senators from the region. As of 2012, a union of the three Maritime provinces would have a population of approximately 1.8 million, becoming the fifth largest by population, out of eight remaining Canadian provinces. The Maritime provinces already cooperate to jointly provide some government services, especially in the areas of purchase and procurement. History Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick were administered as parts of Nova Scotia, until 1769 and 1784, respectively. The region, at the time of French colonization, was referred to in its entirety as Acadia. After Acadia fell to the British, following the Seven Years' War (what is today known as the Nova Scotia peninsula had been in British possession post-1713), the entire region was amalgamated into a single colony named Nova Scotia. During the 1760s, the British split St. John's Island (the present-day Prince Edward Island) into a separate colony, only to merge it again with Nova Scotia several years later. By the 1780s, with the influx of Loyalist refugees from the American Revolutionary War, the disparate geographic regions that comprised Nova Scotia were again split into separate colonies. St. John's Island, New Brunswick and Cape Breton Island all received autonomy with their respective colonial administrations and capitals. By the 1820s, Cape Breton Island was re-merged into Nova Scotia to free up that island's lucrative coal resource royalties, however the remaining two colonies of Prince Edward Island (renamed as such from St. John's Island in the 1790s) and New Brunswick maintained their colonial autonomy. During the late 1840s, Nova Scotia became the first colony in British North America to have responsible government and by the mid-1850s, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island had undergone similar political reforms. The reorganisation of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia into a single British colony was considered in 1863 and 1864 by Arthur Hamilton Gordon, the Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick. The concept of a political union was formally discussed at the Charlottetown Conference in 1864 when Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island were individual colonies in British North America, but that meeting resulted in Confederation of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the Province of Canada, not just of the Maritime colonies or Newfoundland. The Saint John Telegraph-Journal in 1925 stated that the idea \\"could become an intensely practical issue\\", but \\"we should concentrate of Maritime co- operation for Maritime advancement.\\" The idea has been raised from time to time during the 20th century, particularly during the late 1990s in the face of declining regional transfer and equalization payments from the federal government. The discussion was quietly encouraged by politicians in other provinces with the hopes of using such a union to alter the balance of representation in the federal House of Commons and the Senate, based on the belief that the Maritimes are over-represented for their relatively small populations. In 1990, Nova Scotia Premier John Buchanan stated that if Quebec were to secede from Canada, separating English-speaking Canada into two parts, the Atlantic provinces would be \\"absurd\\" to try to form their own country and that there would be \\"no choice\\" but to seek to join the United States. Although he retracted his statement after criticism, in 2001 an American author similarly stated that as the Maritime provinces require substantial transfer payments from Ottawa they would not be a viable independent country. He speculated they might combine, with or without Newfoundland, to make themselves more attractive for admission into the United States as a single state. Regional cooperation Support for a union of the three provinces has historically ebbed and flowed, in conjunction with various socio-economic and political events throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. In the immediate years following Confederation, the anti-Confederate movement in the region advocated Maritime Union and separation from the new federation, fearing that the wealth of the provinces would be sapped to support development and growth of central and western Canada. The concept gained credibility in the 1960s at a time when Maritime governments, in partnership with the federal government, were progressively tackling economic underperformance with various regional development programs. The growth of civil service and social program expenditures in the three provinces, coupled with out-migration and declining national political clout, led the provincial governments to examine ways to pool resources and better lobby for the region in Ottawa. While an actual union was debated in all three provinces, the discussion evolved largely around regional cooperation. Several meetings between all members of the legislative assemblies and the cabinets of the three provinces were conducted during the 1960s, with the result being several important regional cooperation agreements in the areas of health care, post-secondary and secondary education, and in regional intergovernmental coordination, particularly when dealing with Ottawa. Several institutions were formed by the early 1970s to facilitate intra-regional cooperation, including the Council of Maritime Premiers, and various organisations such as the Maritime Provinces Higher Education Commission and the Land Registry Information Service. During this time, the secondary school curriculum in each province was standardised and provincial funding to post-secondary education was coordinated to eliminate duplication, particularly among professional programs (i.e. education, law, engineering, medicine, pharmacology, dentistry, social work, criminology, veterinary medicine, etc.). Equally important to the establishment of these formal organisations was the coordination by the mid-1970s among provincial governments for legislation to harmonise policies and programs, as well as to arrive at common positions on federal-provincial negotiations. By the 1980s, the Council of Maritime Premiers was renamed the Council of Atlantic Premiers with the entry of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador into the partnership. The CAP has led all four provincial governments to extend cooperation in the adoption of common consumption taxes, insurance legislation harmonisation, the Atlantic Lottery Corporation, venture capital funding, a harness racing commission, and the coordination of provincial government procurements, among other items. In addition to historical precedent, there were more pressing reasons to reorganise the colonies. The United States, embroiled in the Civil War, posed a military threat. Many prominent colonial politicians felt that the united colonies would be able to mount a more effective defence. In Britain, the Colonial Office also favoured a reorganisation of British North America. The British hoped that union would make the colonies less reliant on Britain, and therefore less costly to maintain. Gordon's own ambition may also have been a factor‚Äîhe envisioned himself as the governor of the united Maritime colonies. The idea of Maritime Union‚Äîthe reorganisation of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia into a single British colony‚Äîwas not new. Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick had once been administered as parts of Nova Scotia, until 1769 and 1784, respectively. Several of Lieutenant-Governor Gordon's predecessors, including J. H. T. Manners-Sutton, had also favoured reuniting the three colonies. Acadia and \\"New Acadia\\" There are several convergent‚Äîunique, historically related, and ultimately intertwined‚Äîmovements for a limited form of sovereignty and independence, stemming from the New Brunswick region of Canada but ultimately encompassing the whole of the Atlantic provinces and even the northeastern corner of the United States. \\"Acadians\\" traditionally refers to a community mainly in New Brunswick that is linguistically French, but is a distinct culture from Quebec. There have been proposals for Acadia to separate from New Brunswick and become a separate province. This was promoted by the Parti Acadien and is similarly represented by the historic \\"Republic of Madawaska\\". There is limited support for this idea, and drawing the borders of a separate Acadian province would be difficult, as Acadians are dispersed throughout the province as well as in smaller numbers in Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Quebec's Magdalen Islands and the U.S. state of Maine. To help solve this dilemma, in 2007, Second Vermont Republic essayist Thomas H. Naylor proposed a \\"New Acadia\\" which would encompass \\"Vermont... Maine, New Hampshire, and the four Atlantic provinces of Canada\\" The Atlantica Party was created in 2006 to fulfill a similar purpose, of uniting Atlantic Canadians under a common banner and government. However, the party failed to gain any ground or make any significant impact on the political scene in Atlantic Canada. A trade zone uniting the region along these lines has also been formally proposed by the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies and the Atlantic Growth Network (organisations based in Halifax, Nova Scotia) with the support of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, a government agency. Together, they have hosted regular regional conferences promoting the Atlantica trade zone, beginning in 2002 through the last major conference, June 11-June 16, 2007, in Halifax. However, the proposal was also criticised by political activists, most notably Maude Barlow of the Council of Canadians, as little more than a regional prototype for a future North American Union.\\"Breaching Atlantica\\" , Stuart Neatby, June 15, 2006. Gauging support Within the Maritimes, support for the concept of a formal political union of the three provinces has historically been extremely difficult to quantify by pollsters and politicians. Many Maritimers express support for reducing government expenditures through greater regional cooperation, as in such existing cases as the Maritime Film Classification Board and the Atlantic Lottery Corporation. However, when it comes to actually consolidating the bureaucracies of the three provinces (or four if one counts Newfoundland and Labrador in a larger Atlantic Union), the support dwindles as residents of individual provinces do not wish to see the public sector benefit one particular province over the other. There is allegedly some support in urban regions as these regions would stand to gain both politically and economically, however mistrust of a formal political union runs deep in Prince Edward Island, Cape Breton, and many parts of New Brunswick and rural Nova Scotia. Prince Edward Islanders do not wish to give up the freedom of having jurisdictional sovereignty and provincial powers in local control. Many Cape Bretoners harbour exceptionally deep-seated resentment toward mainland Nova Scotia which has benefited from a relatively strong economy in the Halifax area for many years, something which Cape Bretoners and rural Nova Scotians claim has occurred at their expense. A union with PEI and NB might dilute what remaining influence Cape Breton has on provincial affairs which could have a negative impact on the island. New Brunswickers express the same fears as Prince Edward Islanders, fearing the loss of jurisdiction, and as Cape Bretoners, fearing the dilution of influence over provincial affairs. Of particular concern is the possible linguistic and cultural dilution that the Acadian community of New Brunswick would face - comprising over 30 percent of the New Brunswick population, cultural protections guaranteed to Acadians in officially bilingual New Brunswick could be compromised. Although both Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia have Acadian communities as well, both are much smaller and less proportionally significant. Additionally, many rural mainland Nova Scotians distrust the growing economic domination of Halifax and wish to maintain their remaining influence in provincial affairs. = Opinion polls = In May 1970, a Gallup poll among all Canadians asked if the Maritimes should become one province. The results were: 43.8% of respondents agreed, 37.9% disagreed, 18.1% were undecided and 0.3% had a qualified response. Issues A Maritime Union (or an Atlantic Union) would face significant political challenges in gaining broad acceptance across the region, particularly where the existing provinces trace their history since European settlement for several centuries. Entire regional identities, cultures, and economies have developed around the separate French and later British colonies, which constitute the Maritime provinces (or the Atlantic provinces, if Newfoundland and Labrador were to be included). The history of these political jurisdictions cannot be discounted lightly as Nova Scotia's legislature is the oldest seat of responsible government in the Commonwealth of Nations and Prince Edward Island has the second oldest legislative seat in Canada (Province House) and was the site of the Charlottetown Conference. New Brunswick's legislature is the only officially bilingual assembly of the Maritimes. According to environmental historian Mark McLaughlin, the idea of a Maritime Union as suggested by Conservative political leaders is a neoliberal project with intent to facilitate natural resource extraction and deregulation. Several issues which would dominate any discussion of a theoretical Maritime Union include: * Capital city: Charlottetown, Fredericton and Halifax all have existing legislature buildings, political traditions and histories for their respective provinces, while the largest cities in the Maritimes are Halifax, Saint John and Moncton.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/moncton-passes-saint-john- largest-city-1.3971897 Moncton, Sackville, and Amherst have been suggested as capitals due to their central locations. This issue would be most contentious, although the possibility of a rotating capital has been suggested, whereby the legislative buildings in each city could be used on a tri-annual basis. Inter- provincial rivalry would likely prove to be extremely contentious in any decision. * Provincial name: Again, a contentious issue in a region which cherishes its history. Several informal suggestions over the years (mainly by journalists) have included \\"Acadia\\", \\"New Acadia\\", \\"The Maritimes\\", and \\"New Ireland\\". * Official language: The Acadian linguistic minority in New Brunswick, and less-so in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, would demand official bilingualism which is currently in effect in New Brunswick. The Maliseet and Mi'kmaq Nations would also likely contest any linguistic debate. * Federal representation: Each of the three Maritime provinces has been guaranteed a minimum number of seats in the House of Commons of Canada and the Senate since it joined the Canadian Confederation (Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in 1867, Prince Edward Island in 1873), even though their relatively small populations (most notably Prince Edward Island's) have never strictly warranted them. It has been suggested that the existing representation guarantees might not be passed on to a united Maritimes. Additionally, a Maritime Union would presumably be represented at the nation's First Ministers' meetings of the Prime Minister and provincial Premiers by only one voice instead of three or four.

War service View of an Arctic convoy from Sheffield At the outbreak of war, Sheffield served with the 18th Cruiser Squadron, patrolling the Denmark Straits and then, in April 1940, she was engaged in the Norwegian Campaign. After a short spell carrying out anti- invasion duties in the English Channel, she joined Force H, based in Gibraltar. During that time, she operated in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic until the year's end, and took part in Operation White and the battle of Cape Spartivento. In 1941, she participated in Operation Grog, the shelling of Genoa, in operations against Vichy convoys and supporting air reinforcements to Malta. In May, Sheffield took part in the sinking of the , narrowly escaping a friendly fire torpedo attack by the aircraft carrier s Fairey Swordfish; Eleven torpedoes were dropped and only defective Duplex exploders and fine ship handling saved her from disaster.Stephen, Martin.

The reaction of Sheffields crew \\"has not made its way into the official records\\".)Stephen, p.89.. On 12 June, she located and sank one of Bismarcks tankers, Friedrich Breme. After the destruction in early October 1941 of another German supply ship, Kota Penang, (aided by the cruiser ), Sheffield returned to Britain. She was occupied on Arctic convoys until hitting a mine off Iceland on 3 March 1942 and was under repair until July. After more Arctic convoys, Sheffield joined the forces supporting the Allied landings in North Africa (Operation Torch) in November. In December 1942, Sheffield and Jamaica formed \\"Force R\\", under the command of Rear-Admiral Robert Burnett (in Sheffield), which provided cover for Convoy JW 51B. The convoy was attacked by a strong German surface force. In the ensuing action (Battle of the Barents Sea), the Germans withdrew and Sheffield sank the German destroyer , while also damaging the cruiser , Eckoldt mistaking Sheffield for Hipper. During this engagement, the destroyer and the minesweeper were sunk by gunfire of the two German vessels. Ice forms on a 20 inch signal projector during an Arctic convoy to Russia Flagship of the reserve fleet in the 1960s In February 1943, Sheffield moved to operate in the Bay of Biscay and, in July and August, she supported the landings at Salerno (Operation Avalanche). Returning yet again to the Arctic, she took part in the sinking of the battleship Scharnhorst off the north coast of Norway, in late December. In 1944, Sheffield was an escort for the Royal Navy carrier force that executed a series of air attacks on the , between April and August. These had limited success and responsibility was passed to the Royal Air Force. A lengthy refit in Boston and in Britain kept Sheffield out of action until after the end of the war. Post-war Bell in Sheffield Cathedral The refit was completed in May 1946 and Sheffield alternated between duties in the West Indies (where in 1954 she served as flagship of the 8th Cruiser Squadron) and in home waters and the Mediterranean. From June 1952 to May 1953, her commanding officer was Capt. John Inglis, who was to become director of Naval Intelligence in July 1954. In 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.Souvenir Programme, Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15th June 1953, HMSO, Gale and Polden There were further refits in 1949/50,1954 and 1956-7 when her bridge was enclosed, a lattice foremast added, and a comprehensive anti nuclear and biological washdown installed and 1959-60. Her final light anti- aircraft outfit consisted of 8 twin Bofors Mk 5 and 2 single Bofors Mk 7. In 1955 she played the part of the cruiser in the war film The Battle of the River Plate. She went into reserve in January 1959,but as the refit of HMS Swiftsure was stopped due to structure weakness, and the Town cruisers, was considered far more comfortable and able to carry far more light AA, HMS Sheffield was the final World War II cruiser to be refitted for possible use as a GFS monitor, and became flagship of the Reserve Fleet and served again at sea in 1960 and then as an accommodation ship until September 1964, when she was placed on the disposal list. She was widely considered as a historic and great British warship, justifying preservation and a cruiser which maintained far more the character and fit of a WW2 cruiser compared with the more modified Belfast. However by 1966 examination showed Sheffield had deteriorated too much in unmaintained reserve in Fareham Creek and could not be preserved. Her equipment was removed at Rosyth in 1967 and she was then broken up at Faslane in the same year. The stainless steel ship's bell, which was made by Hadfield's of Sheffield, was preserved and today hangs in Sheffield Cathedral along with her battle ensign.

(Nearby towns are Cullerin, Gundaroo, Dalton, Yass, Murrumbateman and Goulburn.) At the , Gunning had a population of 659. The Shire of Gunning (which was amalgamated into Upper Lachlan Shire in 2004) had a population of 2,280. The Gunning Wind Farm has been established to the town's northeast, and is visible from the Hume Highway. A monthly market is held on Yass Street, near the Old Court House, by the local Lions Club, on the 4th Sunday of each month. In and around the historic Courthouse, you'll find jams, honey, arts & crafts, homemade goods, children's toys and books available. Plus, don't forget to get a bacon and egg roll or a sausage or steak sandwich from the Lions Club BBQ for breakfast or lunch. If you make a day of it, Gunning offers historic buildings, great cafes, a few knick-knack and antique shops and a country pub with bistro.  History  The Gunning region was originally home to two Australian Aboriginal language groups, the Gundungurra people in the north and the Ngunnawal people in the south. The region (specifically Gundaroo) was first explored by Europeans in 1820, and settled the next year by Hamilton Hume. In 1824, Hume and William Hovell left here to discover the overland route to Port Phillip Bay where Melbourne is sited. Land sales began in 1838. The nearby town of Dalton, now best known as the earthquake centre, was settled in 1847. In 1865, Bushranger Ben Hall and his gang held up Kimberley's Inn, and a constable was shot dead. In 1886 the town was described as > Wheat, maize, barley, and Oats are produced in the district Natural grass is > plentiful and affords good pasture for flocks and herds. The Great Southern > Railway Line passes near this town. The population is 409.John Sands, The > New atlas of Australia [Sydney, 1886] page 49.  Heritage listings  Gunning has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Main Southern railway: Gunning railway station  Population  In the 2016 Census, there were 659 people in Gunning. 86.9% of people were born in Australia and 91.4% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were Anglican 30.4%, No Religion 25.8% and Catholic 22.6%.  Transportation  Gunning was originally a coach stop, and service centre for the surrounding farms mainly growing Merino sheep. It has a police station and court house, post office, and school. The Main South railway from Sydney arrived in 1875 and was completed through to Albury in 1882. Gunning railway station is served by one daily NSW TrainLink XPT service in each direction operating between Sydney and Melbourne, and one weekly Xplorer service operating between Sydney and Griffith. Its main streets were built very wide, for the time of horse and bullock-drawn wagons. This served the town well when the main highway between Sydney and Melbourne carried cars and trucks through, until the Hume Highway by-pass was completed on 5 April 1993. The town has been able to resume a more rural pace of life, and develop something of an industry in providing bed and breakfast accommodation. The establishment of the main trunk telegraph line is remembered by the Telegraph Hotel.  Notable residents  * Millicent Armstrong was a playwright and farmer in Gunning, New South Wales, who wrote primarily about the experiences of country life in early 20th century Australia.

For many years the \\"number\\" has been the last three digits of \\"the handle\\", the amount race track bettors placed on race day at a major racetrack, published in racing journals and major newspapers in New York. Gamblers place bets with a bookmaker (\\"bookie\\") at a tavern, bar, barber shop, social club, or any other semi-private place that acts as an illegal betting parlor. Runners carry the money and betting slips between the betting parlors and the headquarters, called a numbers bank. Closely related is policy, known as the policy racket, or the policy game. The name \\"policy\\" is based on the similarity to cheap insurance, which is also a gamble on the future. History \\"Policy shops\\", where bettors choose numbers, operated in the United States prior to 1860. In 1875, a report of a select committee of the New York State Assembly stated that \\"the lowest, meanest, worst form ... [that] gambling takes in the city of New York, is what is known as policy playing.\\" It flourished especially in African American and Italian American communities across the country, though it was also played to a lesser extent in many working class Irish-American and Jewish-American communities. It was known in Cuban-American communities as bolita (\\"little ball\\"). Other sources date the origin of Policy, at least in its most well-known form, to 1885 in Chicago. During part of its run from 1868 to 1892, the Louisiana Lottery involved drawing several numbers from 1 to 78, and people wagering would choose their own numbers on which to place a bet. Initially, it instead ran by means of the sale of serially-numbered tickets, and at another point, the numbers drawn ran from 1 to 75. By the early 20th century, the game was associated with poor and working-class communities, as it could be played for as little as a penny. Also, unlike state lotteries, bookies could extend credit to the bettors and policy winners could avoid paying income tax. Different policy banks would offer different rates, although a payoff of 600 to 1 was typical. Since the odds of winning were 999:1 against the bettors, the expected profit for racketeers was enormous. =Boston= In Boston (as well as elsewhere in the northeast), the game was commonly referred to as the \\"nigger pool\\", including in the city's newspapers, due to the game's popularity in black neighborhoods. The number was based on the handle from the early races at Suffolk Downs or, if Suffolk was closed, one of the racetracks in New York. The winner could be controlled by manipulating the handle. After Jerry Angiulo became head of the Mafia in Boston, in 1950, he established a profit sharing plan whereby for every four numbers one of his runners turned in, they would get one for free. This resulted in the numbers game's taking off in Boston. According to Howie Carr, The Boston American was able to stay in business in part because it published the daily number. During the 1950s, Wimpy and Walter Bennett ran a numbers ring in Boston's Roxbury neighborhood. The Bennetts' prot√©g√© Stephen Flemmi took and collected bets for them. Around the same time, Buddy McLean began forming a gang in Somerville, Massachusetts to, among other criminal activities, run numbers. This would become the Winter Hill Gang. By the 1970s, the Winter Hill Gang, then led by Whitey Bulger, moved bookies under its protection away from the numbers game to sports betting, as the state was starting its own lottery, and the National Football League did not allow betting on its games outside of Nevada; thereby Massachusetts could not compete with them. Despite the creation of the state lottery, however, the numbers game's demise in Massachusetts was not immediate, as the state lottery had a lower payout and was taxed. =Chicago= In the 1940s, Eddie Jones and his brothers earned more than $180,000 per week in the black community. While in jail for income tax evasion, Jones became acquainted with Sam Giancana, a hit-man for hire among top Italian Mafia figures. Back on the streets, the men became friends. Eddie taught Sam everything he knew about the policy game and how to memorize number combinations, and even hired Sam to operate one of his many lucrative establishments. Sam made his first fortune through Eddie. Aspiring to become a \\"made man\\", Sam shared his new knowledge of the policy game with the Dons, who were impressed. By then, the Italian Mafia focused their attention on the Jones market in the black community. Under orders from the Dons, Sam was instructed to remove Jones from his lucrative position and take over. To avoid being murdered by the mob, Jones walked away from his family enterprise.LTV021.

The grand jury in the trial of 71 defendants charged that 10 policy houses had been paying $600 a month in payoffs equally divided between the chief of police, the head prosecutor and the mayor, with smaller bribes in the $25 to $50 range going to individual police sergeants and lieutenants.

She was writing slips for the Old Kentucky, Goldfield and Last Chance games, and her top sheet showed that she had written $500 in business on that day (which happened to be Good Friday) alone.\\"In Good Friday Raid, Vice-Busters Strike Again\\", Cleveland Call and Post, April 23, 1949, p. 5. By the 1950s, there were 8 rival numbers games operating in black sections of Cleveland, including \\"California Gold\\", \\"Mound Bayou\\" and \\"T. & O.\\" The winning three-digit number from 000 to 999 was determined by the closing stock market results in the evening papers, with one digit each being taken from the totals for advances, declines, and unchanged. Bets of up to $2 would be placed with hundreds of numbers writers around the city, who would keep 25% of the money bet as their fee. In the mid-afternoon a runner (locally known as the pickup man or woman) would rendezvous with the writers to collect the policy slips and cash, which would be taken to a central location and totaled on adding machines prior to determining the winners. The runners kept 10% of the money bet as their fee. 65 cents on every dollar bet would be delivered to the \\"clearinghouse\\" parlors, which calculated the winners and paid off at 500 to 1 odds, keeping 15 cents on the dollar, on an average day when no \\"hot\\" number hit, for themselves. In the evening the runner would make the rounds again to deliver the cash winnings to those writers whose customers had hit the winning number, and winners would be paid. A number of bars, private clubs and taverns around town, including the \\"Tia Juana\\", served as centers of the action where bettors and writers would congregate and wait for the winners to be announced. After a 1955 car bombing in which the girlfriend of Arthur \\"Little Brother\\" Drake was killed, police conducted a mass roundup of 28 numbers operators and runners on the east side, including Drake, Geech Bell, Don King, Edward Keeling, Dan Boone, Thomas Turk, and others.\\"No Clues in Bomb Death: Mass Roundup of Racketeers is Big Washout\\", Cleveland Call and Post, Sept. 17, 1955, p. 1. The following year Russian gangster Shon Birns tried to keep the peace by setting up a 5-member syndicate of the leading black operators in Cleveland including Don King, Virgil Ogletree, Boone and Keeling to control the game, insure payouts when \\"hot\\" numbers which had been overbet hit for large scores, and limit the payoff odds to 500 to 1; Birns also attempted to introduce a new method of determining the winning number. The game was wildly popular; in the 1950s one Cleveland numbers house was said to clear $20,000 a day.Priscilla Zotti, Injustice for All (Peter Lang, 2005) pp. 1‚Äì8. =Atlanta= In Atlanta the game was known as \\"playing the bug.\\" In 1936 The Atlanta Constitution wrote: \\"Both in the business section and the residential areas, one or more solicitors make their daily morning rounds into every office and every home. Then, in the afternoons, the \\"pay-off\\" men make their rounds over the same routes. Their patrons include every class of Atlanta citizens‚Äîprofessional men, businessmen, housewives, and even children.\\"\\"Smashing of 'Bug' Racket Up to Public, Says Boykin,\\" Atlanta Constitution, December 18, 1936, p. 1. \\"The bug\\" was believed by police to be grossing citywide as much as $30,000 in bets a day at its height in 1937‚Äì1938. During a police crackdown in 1943, authorities claimed that the game was in decline and \\"they are lucky if they bank as much as $12,000 to $15,000 a day,\\" after a raid on an alleged headquarters on Parsons Street.\\"Bug Racket at Low Ebb in Atlanta\\", Atlanta Constitution, April 8, 1943, p. 12. In 1944, eight bug rings were believed to be operating in the city, collectively handling a total of $15,000 to $20,000 in bets on an average day. Writers took out a 25% commission before passing on the rest of the day's receipts to the house.\\"$3,000 Tickets, 5 Men Seized in Lottery Raid,\\" Atlanta Constitution, June 30, 1944, p. 1. Bug writers employed a number of schemes to foil police: in 1936 police observed writers carrying the day's bet slips gathering under the bridge which passes over the railroad tracks at Nelson St. As lottery squad officers watched, a pick-up car pulled up and stopped on the bridge overhead, the writers threw their paper sacks full of bet slips up to it, and the car sped off.\\"'Bug' Men Driven to Cover of Night,\\" Atlanta Constitution, February 18, 1936, p. 1. In 1937 indictments were brought against the alleged \\"big shots\\" of the bug game in Atlanta, including Bob Hogg, the Hall brothers (Albert and Leonard), Flem King, Willie Carter, Walter Cutcliffe, Glenn House, and Henry F. Shorter.\\"Ten Reputed 'Big Shots' Named in Bills Drawn for Jury in Lottery Quiz: Hogg, Cutcliffe, House and Halls Reported in List,\\" Atlanta Constitution, Oct. 1, 1937, p. 1. Henry Shorter was a barber who ran the game out of his barber shop. In 1944, Shorter was one of a select group of 20 African-American community leaders who were turned away from the polls when they attempted to vote in the Democratic primary; the Rev. M.L. King, father of Martin Luther King Jr., was among the others who participated in this protest.St. John, M.L. \\"Token Attempt to Vote Made by Negroes Here,\\" Atlanta Constitution, July 5, 1944, p. 3. = Bahamas = Number games are popular in many Bahamian communities. While gambling in casinos is legal for tourists visiting the Bahamas, it is forbidden for Bahamian residents. There is also no legalized lottery for Bahamian nationals. As a result, the predominant form of gambling among residents is playing the Numbers. =New York City= The Italian lottery was operated as a racket for the American Mafia, originally in Italian-American neighborhoods such as Little Italy, Manhattan and Italian Harlem by mobsters of the Morello crime family. A young Joseph Bonanno, future boss of the Bonanno crime family, expanded the Italian lottery operation to all of Brooklyn and invested the profits in many legitimate businesses. In the 1930s, Vito Genovese, crime boss of the Genovese crime family, ruled the Italian lottery in New York and New Jersey, bringing in over $1 million per year, owned four Greenwich Village night clubs, a dog track in Virginia, and other legitimate businesses. Dutch Schultz is said to have rigged this system, thanks to an idea from Otto Berman, by betting heavily on certain races to change the Win, Place and Show numbers that determine the winning lottery number. This allegedly added ten percent to the Mob take.Sifakis, pp. 38‚Äì39 Harlem Francis A. J. Ianni, in his book Black Mafia: Ethnic Succession in Organized Crime writes: \\"By 1925 there were thirty black policy banks in Harlem, several of them large enough to collect bets in an area of twenty city blocks and across three or four avenues.\\" By 1931, big time numbers operators in Harlem included James Warner, Stephanie St. Clair (\\"Madame Queen\\"), Casper Holstein, Ellsworth \\"Bumpy\\" Johnson, Wilfred Brunder, Jose Miro, Joseph Ison, Masjoe Ison and Simeon Francis.Harlem Gangs: The Numbers Game from Crime Library The game survived despite periodic police crackdowns. =Legal lotteries= Today, many state lotteries offer similar \\"daily numbers\\" games, typically relying on mechanical devices to draw the number. The state's rake is typically 50% rather than the 20‚Äì40% of the numbers game. The New York Lottery and Pennsylvania Lottery even use the names \\"Numbers\\" and \\"Daily Number\\" respectively. Despite the existence of legal alternatives, some gamblers still prefer to play with a bookie for a number of reasons. Among them are the ability to bet on credit, better payoffs, the convenience of calling in one's bet on the telephone, the ability to play if under the legal age, and the avoidance of government taxes. Gameplay One of the problems of the early game was to find a way to draw a random number. Initially, winning numbers were set by the daily outcome of a random drawing of numbered balls, or by spinning a \\"policy wheel\\", at the headquarters of the local numbers ring. The daily outcomes were publicized by being posted after the draw at the headquarters, and were often \\"fixed\\". The existence of rigged games, used to cheat players and drive competitors out of business, as well as the practical obstacles to holding a drawing for a lottery that is illegal, later led to the use of widely published unpredictable numbers such as the last three numbers in the published daily balance of the United States Treasury, or the middle three digits of the number of shares traded that day on the New York Stock Exchange. This is what led to the change from the game of policy, where 12 or 13 numbers from 1 to 78 were drawn, and players bet on combinations of four or fewer of them, to the \\"numbers game\\" where players chose a three-digit number to bet on. The use of a central, independently- chosen number allowed for gamblers from a larger area to engage in the same game and it made larger wins possible. It also gave customers confidence in the fairness of the games, which could still generate vast profits even if run honestly as they paid out only around $600 for every $1000 wagered. When the Treasury began rounding off the balance, many bookies began to use the \\"mutuel\\" number. This consisted of the last dollar digit of the daily total handle of the Win, Place and Show bets at a local race track, read from top to bottom. For example, if the daily handle (takings at the racetrack) was: * Win $1004.25 * Place $583.56 * Show $27.61 then the daily number was 437. By 1936, \\"The Bug\\" had spread to cities such as Atlanta, where the winning number was determined by the last digit of that day's New York bond sales.Associated Press, February 12, 1936 Policy dealers * Albert J.

Along with Ceratopsia, it makes up the clade Marginocephalia. Genera include Pachycephalosaurus, Stegoceras, and Prenocephale. With the exception of two species, most pachycephalosaurs lived during the Late Cretaceous Period, dating between about 85.8 and 65.5 million years ago. They are exclusive to the Northern Hemisphere, all of them being found in North America and Asia. They were all bipedal, herbivorous/omnivorous animals with thick skulls. Skulls can be domed, flat, or wedge-shaped depending on the species, and are all heavily ossified. The domes were often surrounded by nodes and/or spikes. Partial skeletons have been found of several pachycephalosaur species, but to date no complete skeletons have been discovered. Often isolated skull fragments are the only bones that are found. Candidates for the earliest known pachycephalosaur include Ferganocephale adenticulatum from Middle Jurassic Period strata of Kyrgyzstan and Stenopelix valdensis from Early Cretaceous strata of Germany, although R.M. Sullivan has doubted that either of these species are pachycephalosaurs.[2] In 2017, a phylogenetic analysis conducted by Han and colleagues identified Stenopelix as a member of the Ceratopsia. Paleobiology Anatomy = Pachycephalosaurs were bipedal ornithischians characterized by their thickened skulls. They had a bulky torso with an expanded gut cavity and broad hips, short forelimbs, long legs, a short, thick neck, and a heavy tail. Large orbits and a large optic nerve point to pachycephalosaurs having good vision, and uncharacteristically large olfactory lobes indicate that they had a good sense of smell relative to other dinosaurs. They were fairly small dinosaurs, with most falling in the range of 2‚Äì3 meters (6.6-9.8 feet) in length and the largest, Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis, estimated to measure 4.5 meters (14.8 feet) long and weigh 450 kilograms (990 pounds). The characteristic skull of pachycephalosaurs is a result of the fusion and thickening of the frontals and parietals, accompanied by the closing of the supratemporal fenestra. In some species this takes the form of a raised dome; in others, the skull is flat or wedge-shaped. While the flat-headed pachycephalosaurs are traditionally regarded as distinct species or even families, they may represent juveniles of dome-headed adults.[2][3] All display highly ornamented jugals, squamosals, and postorbitals in the form of blunt horns and nodes. Many species are only known from skull fragments, and a complete pachycephalosaur skeleton is yet to be found. =Head-butting behavior= Restoration of head butting Pachycephalosaurus Hypothetical examples of pachycephalosaur combat behavior, varying per species: Pachycephalosaurus (A), Prenocephale (B), Stygimoloch (C). The adaptive significance of the skull dome has been heavily debated. The popular hypothesis among the general public that the skull was used in head-butting, as sort of a dinosaurian battering ram, was first proposed by . This view was popularized in the 1956 science fiction story \\"A Gun for Dinosaur\\" by L. Sprague de Camp. Many paleontologists have since argued for the head-butting hypothesis, including and . In this hypothesis, pachycephalosaurs rammed each other head-on, as do modern-day mountain goats and musk oxen. Pachycephalosaurus based on the \\"Sandy\\" specimen in the Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center, Woodland Park, Colorado Anatomical evidence for combative behavior includes vertebral articulations providing spinal rigidity, and the shape of the back indicating strong neck musculature. It has been suggested that a pachycephalosaur could make its head, neck, and body horizontally straight, in order to transmit stress during ramming. However, in no known dinosaur could the head, neck, and body be oriented in such a position. Instead, the cervical and anterior dorsal vertebrae of pachycephalosaurs show that the neck was carried in an \\"S\\"- or \\"U\\"-shaped curve. Also, the rounded shape of the skull would lessen the contacted surface area during head-butting, resulting in glancing blows. Other possibilities include flank-butting, defense against predators, or both. The relatively wide build of pachycephalosaurs (which would protect vital internal organs from harm during flank-butting) and the squamosal horns of the Stygimoloch (which would have been used to great effect during flank-butting) add credence to the flank-butting hypothesis. A histological study conducted by argued against the battering ram hypothesis. They argued that the dome was \\"an ephemeral ontogenetic stage\\", the spongy bone structure could not sustain the blows of combat, and the radial pattern was simply an effect of rapid growth. Later biomechanical analyses by and concluded, however, that the domes could withstand combat stresses. argued that the growth patterns discussed by Goodwin and Horner are not inconsistent with head-butting behavior. instead argued that the dome functioned for species recognition. There is evidence that the dome had some form of external covering, and it is reasonable to consider the dome may have been brightly covered, or subject to change color seasonally. Due to the nature of the fossil record, however, it cannot be observed whether or not color played a role in dome function. argued that species recognition is an unlikely evolutionary cause for the dome, because dome forms are not notably different between species. Because of this general similarity, several genera of Pachycephalosauridae have sometimes been incorrectly lumped together. This is unlike the case in ceratopsians and hadrosaurids, which had much more distinct cranial ornamentation. Longrich et al argued that instead the dome had a mechanical function, such as combat, one which was important enough to justify the resource investment. Support for head-butting by paleopathology Peterson et al (2013) studied cranial pathologies among the Pachycephalosauridae and found that 22% of all domes examined had lesions that are consistent with osteomyelitis, an infection of the bone resulting from penetrating trauma, or trauma to the tissue overlying the skull leading to an infection of the bone tissue. This high rate of pathology lends more support to the hypothesis that pachycephalosaurid domes were employed in intra-specific combat. The frequency of trauma was comparable across the different genera in this family, despite the fact that these genera vary with respect to the size and architecture of their domes, and fact that they existed during varying geologic periods. These findings were in stark contrast with the results from analysis of the relatively flat-headed pachycephalosaurids, where there was an absence of pathology. This would support the hypothesis that these individuals represent either females or juveniles, where intra-specific combat behavior is not expected. Histological examination reveals that pachycephalosaurid domes are composed of a unique form of fibrolamellar boneReid REH (1997) \\"Histology of bones and teeth.\\" In: Currie, PJ and Padian, K, editors. Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs. Academic Press, San Diego, CA. 329‚Äì339. which contains fibroblasts that play a critical role in wound healing, and are capable of rapidly depositing bone during remodeling. Peterson et al (2013) concluded that, taken together, the frequency of lesion distribution and the bone structure of frontoparietal domes lend strong support to the hypothesis that pachycephalosaurids used their unique cranial structures for agonistic behavior. =Diet= The small size of most pachycephalosaur species and lack of skeletal adaptation indicates that they were not climbers and primarily ate food close to the ground. Mallon et al. (2013) examined herbivore coexistence on the island continent of Laramidia, during the Late Cretaceous and concluded that pachycephalosaurids were generally restricted to feeding on vegetation at, or below, the height of 1 meter. They exhibit heterodonty, having different tooth morphology between the premaxillary teeth and maxillary teeth. Front teeth are small and peg-like with an ovular cross section and were most likely used for grabbing food. In some species, the last premaxillary tooth was enlarged and canine-like. Back teeth are small and triangular with denticles on the front and back of the crown, used for mouth processing. In species in which the dentary has been found, mandibular teeth are similar in size and shape to those in the upper jaw. Wear patterns on the teeth vary by species, indicating a range of food preferences which could include seeds, stems, leaves, fruits, and possibly insects. A very wide rib cage and large gut cavity extending all the way to the base of the tail suggests the use of fermentation to digest food.  Biogeography  Distribution = Pachycephalosaurs lived exclusively in Laurasia, being found in western North America and central Asia. Pachycephalosaurs originated in Asia and had two major dispersal events, resulting in the two separate waves of pachycephalosaur evolution observed in Asia. The first, occurring before the late Santonian or early Campanian, involved a migration from Asia to North America, most likely by way of the Bering Land Bridge. This migration was by a common ancestor of Stygimoloch, Stegoceras, Tylocephale, Prenocephale, and Pachycephalosaurus. The second event occurred before the middle Campanian, and involved a migration back into Asia from North America by a common ancestor of Prenocephale and Tylocephale. Two species originally reported to be pachycephalosaurs discovered outside this range, Yaverlandia bitholus of England and Majungatholus atopus of Madagascar, have recently been shown to actually be theropods. = Environment = The Asian and North American species of pachycephalosaurs lived in markedly different environments. Asian specimens are normally more intact, indicating they were not transported far from their place of death before fossilization. They likely lived in a large desert region in central Asia with a hot and arid climate. North American specimens are typically found in rocks that were formed by erosion from the Rocky Mountains. Specimens are far less intact; usually only skull caps are recovered, and those found regularly exhibit surface exfoliation and other signs that they were transported long distances by water before fossilization. It is assumed that they lived in the mountains in a temperate climate and were carried by erosion after death to their final resting place. Classification Diagram showing Dracorex and Stygimoloch as growth stages of Pachycephalosaurus Most pachycephalosaurid remains are not complete, usually consisting of portions of the frontoparietal bone that forms the distinctive dome. This can make taxonomic identification a difficult task, as the classification of genera and species within Pachycephalosauria relies almost entirely on cranial characteristics. Consequently, improper species have historically been appointed to the clade. For instance, Majungatholus, once thought to be a pachycephalosaur, is now recognized as a specimen of the abelisaurid theropod Majungasaurus, and Yaverlandia, another dinosaur initially described as a pachycephalosaurid, has also recently been reclassified as a coelurosaur (Naish in ). Further complicating matters are the diverse interpretations of ontogenetic and sexual features in pachycephalosaurs. A 2009 paper proposed that Dracorex and Stygimoloch were just early growth stages of Pachycephalosaurus, rather than distinct genera. A 2020 reworking of Cerapoda by Dieudonn√© et al. recovered the animals traditionally considered 'heterodontosaurids' as a basal grouping within Pachycephalosauria, paraphyletic with respect to the traditional, dome- headed pachycephalosaurs. =Taxonomy= Two mounted Stegoceras skeletons at the Royal Tyrrell Museum. ornithiscian teeth. The Pachycephalosauria was first named as a suborder of the order Ornithischia by . They included within it only one family, the Pachycephalosauridae. Later researchers, such as Michael Benton, have ranked it as an infraorder of a suborder Cerapoda, which unites the ceratopsians and ornithopods. In 2006, Robert Sullivan published a re-evaluation of pachycephalosaur taxonomy. Sullivan considered attempts by Marya≈Ñska and Osm√≥lska to restrict the definition of Pachycephalosauria redundant with their Pachycephalosauridae, since they were diagnosed by the same anatomical characters. Sullivan also rejected attempts by , in his phylogenetic studies, to re-define Pachycephalosauridae to include only \\"dome- skulled\\" species (including Stegoceras and Pachycephalosaurus), while leaving more \\"basal\\" species outside that family in Pachycephalosauria. Therefore, Sullivan's use of Pachycephalosauridae is equivalent to Sereno and Benton's use of Pachycephalosauria. Sullivan diagnosed the Pachycephalosauridae-based only on characters of the skull, with the defining character being a dome- shaped frontoparietal skull bone. According to Sullivan, the absence of this feature in some species assumed to be primitive led to the split in classification between domed and non-domed pachycephalosaurs; however, discovery of more advanced and possibly juvenile pachycephalosaurs with flat skulls (such as Dracorex hogwartsia) show this distinction to be incorrect. Sullivan also pointed out that the original diagnosis of Pachycephalosauridae centered around \\"flat to dome-like\\" skulls, so the flat-headed forms should be included in the family.

It was written by Bornedal and Steven Soderbergh. It is a remake of the Danish film Nattevagten (1994), which was also directed by Bornedal. Plot Law student Martin Bells is hired as a night watchman at a hospital morgue. A string of gruesome prostitute murders committed by a necrophiliac serial killer quickly point to him as the lead suspect in the investigation carried out by Inspector Thomas Cray. At the same time, Martin slowly discovers clues that point to the real perpetrator. Cast * Ewan McGregor as Martin Bells * Patricia Arquette as Catherine * Josh Brolin as James Gallman * Lauren Graham as Marie * Nick Nolte as Inspector Thomas Cray * Brad Dourif as Duty Doctor * Alix Koromzay as Joyce * Anais Evans as Leanne * Lonny Chapman as Old Watchman * Larry Cedar as Waiter (uncredited) * Sandra Hess as Student (uncredited) * John C. Reilly as Deputy Inspector Bill Davis (uncredited) Production After the original Nattevagten found critical acclaim in 1994, director Ole Bornedal was hired by Dimension Films (who had recently purchased the distribution rights for Nattevagten) to come to the United States and remake the film. The remake was intended to be the first of three films Bornedal would direct for Miramax, the parent company of Dimension. Principal photography for the remake took place in Culver City, California and UCLA. Nightwatch took a year to complete, due to a series of test screenings and reshoots Miramax ordered. Changes made by Miramax to the finished cut included reducing the role of James's girlfriend Marie, and adding a \\"more satisfying final scene.\\" Bornedal went on to state that \\"the actual shooting of Nightwatch was terrific, everything was totally wonderful, and I was free to do as I pleased, but everything suddenly became extremely complicated during the post-production phase.\\" The co-writer of the film's script, Steven Soderbergh, is described as having \\"sanitized\\" the original 1994 script. For example, in the Danish version, there is a scene at a restaurant where the character Jens orders a prostitute to give Martin a blowjob. In the remake, Jens (now known as James) instead orders the prostitute to give Martin a handjob. Also added by Soderbergh were American pop culture references, including a scene where Martin mutters \\"It's just like one of those movies on the USA Network, the hero sees something weird and no one will believe him.\\" Soderbergh himself noted his frustrations at how nearly a year after shooting had begun, he was being forced to provide new script pages for reshoots that were going to be detrimental to the quality of the film. An opening credit sequence was designed by Kyle Cooper, who had also worked on the opening credits for other films, such as Seven and Mimic. It contained a photo montage of women with their eyes scratched out; as the killer's trademark in the film was to remove the eyes of his victims. Cooper then shot these images submerged in water, to give them an added layer of distance and make them ripple spectrally on the screen. Music Nightwatch's background score was handled by Danish composer Joachim Holbek, who, like many of the crew, was also involved in the original version. When Nightwatch was in the process of being re-edited during 1997, Scream composer Marco Beltrami was brought in to rescore several scenes. He also composed the score for a newly shot scene at the beginning of the film, involving the killer and a prostitute.Film Score Monthly. Volume 2 (August 1997). While Martin is working at the morgue, there are sequences where he listens to licensed songs from alternative rock/electronic artists The Chemical Brothers, R.E.M. and Transister. The closing credits featured the song \\"Pain\\" by Super 8, an alternative rock band briefly signed to Hollywood Records in the mid-90s. Originally, songs by the band Garbage also appeared throughout, but they were later removed in post- production. To coincide with the film's debut in 1997, an accompanying soundtrack album was going to be released by Hollywood Records.Nightwatch poster. Dimension Films, c. 1997 However, when the American theatrical release got delayed, plans for the soundtrack album were ultimately abandoned. Release In the United States, Nightwatch was originally scheduled to come out in the fall of 1996. Due to the extended post-production, it was pushed back to several dates, including spring/summer 1997 and October 1997 (as suggested by the film's 1997 copyright year), before eventually getting an American theatrical run in April 1998. It has been claimed that the October 1997 release date was cancelled to avoid competition with another Ewan McGregor film, A Life Less Ordinary, to be released that same month. While these delays were occurring, the film received its worldwide premiere during February 1997 at M√°laga International Week of Fantastic Cinema in Spain, garnering reviews in select publications during the following months. Reception Nightwatch received mostly mixed reviews from critics. The film currently holds both a 6.2/10 score on IMDb based on 17,788 user ratings and a 28% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 29 reviews from critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C-\\" on an A+ to F scale. In an April 1998 review, Stephen Holden of The New York Times criticized Nightwatch for \\"spending so much time churning up eerie atmospheric effects that it doesn't have time to develop its preposterous story in which Martin finds himself accused of the murders.\\" Holden also called the film's climax \\"clumsily prolonged.\\" Roger Ebert's review states that \\"this film depends so heavily on horror effects, blind alleys, false leads and red herrings that eventually watching it stops being an experience and becomes an exercise.\\" In a review for Variety, Leonard Klady claimed \\"It‚Äôs not ideas that are lacking, but the connective tissue to give them life. The absence of even a vague unifying spirit reduces Nightwatch almost to the level of an intellectual ‚Äúsnuff‚Äù film.\\" Klady stated that he believed the film's cast had been underutilized, going on to write \\"Patricia Arquette is squandered in the girlfriend role, and Brolin has more energy than focus in a badly conceived part.\\" In spite of this, he praised Alix Koromzay's minor role as \\"a vulnerable and tragic teenage hooker.\\" Marc Savlov from The Austin Chronicle commented that \\"Arquette and Brolin seem as though they're off in their own private universe.\\" Los Angeles Times writer Jack Matthews compared Nightwatch to the 1995 thriller Seven, mentioning that \\"Like Seven, it mixes the styles of suspense, horror and film noir, using murky lighting, odd angles and deliberately paced camera movements to create an atmosphere of constant dread.\\" But he went on to write that \\"at least [Seven's] villain was on a mission--to punish violators of the Seven Deadly Sins--that would be personally threatening to most members of the audience. The psycho in Nightwatch is a necrophiliac, the scourge of the county morgue, with the peculiar habit of killing and mutilating prostitutes before having sex with them.\\" A more positive review at the time came from Paul Clinton of CNN. He stated that \\"Nightwatch is a fairly good effort\\" and that \\"the cinematography by Dan Laustsen and the lighting are excellent and add immensely to the overall tension of the piece.\\" However, he too criticized the climax of the film, referring to it as \\"cartoonish.\\" Like Clinton, Malcolm Johnson of the Hartford Courant commented on the lighting of the film in his review, writing \\"True to his Scandinavian background, Bornedal has shot Nightwatch largely in semi-darkness, beginning with a violent murder in a prostitute's bedroom.\\" =Legacy and comparisons to Nattevagten= Comparing the differences in tone between Nattevagten and Nightwatch, Tommy Gustafsson notes in his 2015 book Nordic Film Genre that \\"While the [1997] Hollywood remake opens immediately with a gratuitously gruesome murder, the 1994 Danish version builds a eerie mood much more slowly and is only a pure thriller in its last third.\\" AllMovie claim \\"artistic elements of the original gave way to name actors, slicker production values, and the more conventional grindhouse genre approach, opening with a brutal prostitute murder in a pre-credit sequence.\\" Michael Obel, who worked as a producer on both the original and the remake, remarked in 2002, \\"The Danish version is better, we can surely agree on that. Several test screenings and re-editing ended up in a version that is less than optimum.\\" In a 1999 interview, actor Nick Nolte revealed he had never seen the 1997 film, stating \\"As the studio got it, they realized that they had a European-paced film, and they kept hacking at it and hacking at it.\\" Ewan McGregor similarly remarked at the time that \\"This was the perfect example of a film they would not leave alone. There were constant reshoots, including the ending, and they took all the interesting stuff out, making it bland. The original concept was the reason I accepted it in the first place. I had massive strands of the character removed, which is insulting.\\" In 2019, McGregor again spoke out against Miramax's post-production interference on Nightwatch, claiming Harvey Weinstein \\"ruined that film\\" and that Weinstein \\"made us reshoot everything ‚Äî everything that was interesting about the film he replaced.\\" In 2020, the website Flickering Myth included it on their list of \\"10 Essential Forgotten Films\\". They wrote the film is \\"filled to the brim with atmosphere and quirky characters\\" and that it \\"has aged well.\\" =Awards= { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Award ! scope=\\"col\\" Date of ceremony ! scope=\\"col\\" Category ! scope=\\"col\\" Nominee ! scope=\\"col\\" Result - ! scope=\\"row\\"  M√°laga International Week of Fantastic Cinema  1997  Best Director  Ole Bornedal  } ReferencesExternal links  * Category:1997 films Category:1997 horror films Category:1997 crime thriller films Category:1990s psychological thriller films Category:American slasher films Category:American horror thriller films Category:English-language films Category:American remakes of Danish films Category:Horror film remakes Category:American serial killer films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American films Category:Films directed by Ole Bornedal Category:Films with screenplays by Steven Soderbergh Category:Necrophilia in film ","title":"Nightwatch (1997 film)"},{"id":"1624933","text":"Hamnuna (Hebrew: ◊î◊û◊†◊ï◊†◊ê) is the name of several rabbis in the Talmud: * Hamnuna Sabba (\\"the elder\\").

Born in Murwillumbah in 1922, Willis was educated at Murwillumbah High School and the University of Sydney, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts with double honours. Enlisting during the Second World War, Willis served on the homefront and later served in New Guinea and the Philippines. He continued to serve the Citizen Military Forces until 1958. After serving a period as a geographer, Willis was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Liberal member for Earlwood in 1950. He rose to become a long-serving Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party from 1959 to 1975 under Robert Askin. When the Coalition won the 1965 election, Willis was made a Minister of the Crown as Chief Secretary, Minister for Labour and Industry, Tourism and Sport but rose to prominence in his role as Minister for Education from 1972 to 1976. When Askin retired in 1975, Willis failed in his attempts to succeed him. Following the ousting of Askin's successor, Tom Lewis, by the party, Willis was elected as the Parliamentary Leader of the Liberal Party and subsequently became Premier. However, after only four months in office, his Liberal/National Country Party Coalition was defeated at the 1976 election by the Labor Party under Neville Wran. Continuing as Leader of the Opposition, Willis resigned in 1977 and retired from politics a year later. Thereafter he served in various organisations and directorships until his death in May 1999. Early life Willis was born in January 1922 in Murwillumbah, New South Wales, the first son of Archibald Clarence Willis (1893‚Äì1975), a butter factory hand and First World War veteran, and his wife, Vida Mabel Buttenshaw (1894‚Äì1984). His younger brother was NSW Legislative Council Member and President, Max Willis. He was educated at Tyalgum Public School and then at Murwillumbah High School, at which he was Dux of his year and won a scholarship to study Arts at the University of Sydney. He received a Bachelor of Arts with double honours in Modern History and Geography (BA (Hons)) from Sydney University in 1942. He served in the Second Australian Imperial Force from 1941 to 1946 in Army Intelligence in New Guinea and Philippines during the Second World War ending the war with the rank of Sergeant. He remained in the military after demobilisation, being discharged from the regular military on 3 June 1946.World War II Nominal Roll: WILLIS, ERIC ARCHIBALD He continued to serve in the Citizen Military Forces (CMF) from 1946, achieving the rank of major in 1948, until retiring in 1958. He married Norma Dorothy Thompson on 11 May 1951 and they had a daughter and two sons. Willis was employed as a senior geographer and investigation officer for Cumberland County Council Political career Willis on his election as Deputy Leader in July 1959. Willis joined the newly formed Liberal Party of Australia in 1945, after hearing a speech by Sir Robert Menzies. He sought preselection for the federal seat of Evans in the 1949 federal election but was defeated in favour of Frederick Osborne. Instead, he gained preselection for and contested the Labor seat of Lang and gained 45.3 per cent of the vote but was defeated by the sitting member, Dan Mulcahy. At the June 1950 state election, at the age of 28, Willis was elected to the newly created Legislative Assembly seat of Earlwood, in the inner southwestern suburbs of Sydney, becoming the youngest Member of Parliament. He gained the seat with 55.53% against a single Labor candidate. He soon gained a reputation as rebel in the House, always attacking the Labor Speakers, and consequently being expelled from the house more than any other member. At the February 1953 election, Willis narrowly retained his seat with 50.33%, but at the following 1956 election, he increased his margin to 58.04%. During his time as member for Earlwood, Willis catered to the changing demographics of his electorate by creating the first-ever Greek branch of the Liberal Party and formed the first Young Liberals branch in Australia, which counted among its recruits future Prime Minister John Howard (1996‚Äì2007). Following the 1959 election, at which Willis retained his seat with 58.43%, the Liberal leadership was vacated by Pat Morton. Willis declined to run for the leadership and Deputy Leader Robert Askin was made Leader. Willis then ran unopposed and subsequently became Deputy Leader. At the March 1962 election, despite losing the election, Willis went on to retain his seat for a fifth time with 57.26%. =Minister of the Crown= In 1965, the May general election ended 24 years of Labor government and began Willis's ministerial career, which spanned the entire length of the Coalition Government. After retaining his seat again with 59.95%, he was appointed to the post of Chief Secretary and Minister for Tourism by Premier Askin in May 1965 to June 1972. Willis was appointed Minister for Labour and Industry from 1965 to March 1971 and during that same time he was also Minister for Sport. From June 1972 to January 1976 he was Minister for Education, where he presided over a huge expansion of schools, teachers and ancillary staff. Willis served as a Fellow of University of Sydney Senate in 1972. Willis was regarded as the outstanding minister of the Askin Government and is considered one of the state's greatest Education Ministers. For his service as Minister, Willis was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on 15 June 1974. =Premier= Upon Askin's retirement in January 1975, Willis was seen as the favourite to take the premiership. However, despite Askin's initial support, Willis refused his help, preferring to gain the leadership on his own merits. Askin then put his support behind the Minister for Lands, Tom Lewis. Willis, sure he had support, refused to campaign, and the party put its support behind Lewis, leading to his election to Premier. Willis was then replaced as Deputy by John Maddison. For his service as Deputy Leader he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) on 14 June 1975. Lewis was Premier for only one year and looked increasingly likely to lead the state Liberals to defeat. At the party room meeting on 20 January 1976, parliamentary backbencher Neil Pickard called a spill motion. This was carried 22 votes to 11 and Willis was made Leader and Premier unopposed. Willis and his Cabinet were then duly sworn in on 23 January by the Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales, Sir Laurence Street. In his brief time as Premier he extensively reshuffled the cabinet, dropping five ministers in an attempt to distance himself from the past, including Steve Mauger and John Mason, and appointed new cabinet faces such as Pickard and David Arblaster. His most significant decision was to set up in April 1976 the long-demanded inquiry into the prison system in the form of a Royal Commission under Justice Nagle. Willis also introduced Daylight Saving time, to be decided upon in a referendum, scrapped the unpopular petrol tax and announced a masterplan for Sydney's transport system. When former Minister Steve Mauger resigned on 27 January 1976, sparking a by-election in his seat of Monaro in May, and early polls had indicated a large swing to Labor, Willis announced an early election on 1 May, thereby cancelling the by-election in the hope of preventing a larger move of voters against the government. In the May 1976 election, Willis's government lost power to the Labor Party under Neville Wran. The election was notable for being very close run; with the seats of Gosford and Hurstville being lost by only 74 and 44 votes respectively. Had Willis retained those seats he would have remained in government. At that same election Daylight Saving time for New South Wales was passed by 68.4 per cent for and 31.6 per cent against and whenever Willis was asked what his greatest achievement as Premier was, he would always say \\"Daylight Saving\\".Sydney Morning Herald, 12 May 1999, p. 8 Government House on 23 January 1976.

On 19 January 1977, the Granville rail disaster claimed the lives of 83 people‚Äîthe worst rail disaster in Australian history at the time. In response to this, Willis declared that there had never been as many deaths on the railways during the Liberal Government. The insensitive remark led several Liberal MLAs to introduce a no-confidence motion in Willis' leadership. While Willis survived the motion, speculation about a leadership challenge continued for the rest of his term. On 15 December four party MPs declared that they would oppose him in a leadership ballot the next day. On 15 December 1977, Willis called a press conference to announce his intention to resign as leader: On 16 December, he formally resigned as leader at the party meeting and was replaced by Peter Coleman. Willis resigned as Member for Earlwood on 16 June 1978, at the age of 56. At the resulting by-election, Earlwood fell to the Labor candidate, Ken Gabb. =After politics= On his retirement, he was permitted by Queen Elizabeth II, on the Governor's recommendation, to continue to use the title \\"The Honourable\\" for life. After retiring from politics Willis held positions with the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists and the Arthritis Foundation, of which he was Executive Director from 1984 to 1991. Willis also spent time as Vice-President of the Red Cross (NSW Branch) and was a Fellow of the Royal Society of St George, a Member of the Australian Institute of Political Science and the Australian Institute of International Affairs. Willis left his residence in Bardwell Park and moved to Neutral Bay, where his marriage collapsed. He divorced his first wife, Norma, and remarried to Lynn. He died in Sydney on 10 May 1999.

It originally applied to shipping along coastal routes, port to port, but now applies to aviation, railways, and road transport as well. Cabotage rights are the right of a company from one country to trade in another country. In aviation, it is the right to operate within the domestic borders of another country. Most countries do not permit aviation cabotage, and there are strict sanctions against it, for reasons of economic protectionism, national security, or public safety. One notable exception is the European Union, whose member states all grant cabotage rights to each other. Etymology The term \\"cabotage\\" is borrowed from French. It is derived from caboter which means \\"to travel along the coast\\". The origin of caboter is obscure: it may come from cap or cabo \\"cape\\", or it may refer to a type of boat. Attempts to link the name to the Italian explorer Cabot are not supported by evidence. In shipping Cabotage laws apply to merchant ships in most countries that have a coastline so as to protect the domestic shipping industry from foreign competition, preserve domestically owned shipping infrastructure for national security purposes, and ensure safety in congested territorial waters. For the history of cabotage in UK law, see Navigation Acts. In the United States, the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (Jones Act) requires that all goods transported by water between U.S. ports be carried on U.S.-flag ships, constructed in the United States, owned by U.S. citizens, and crewed by U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents. The Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886 states that no foreign vessels shall transport passengers between ports or places in the United States, either directly or by way of a foreign port. Indonesia implemented a cabotage policy in 2005 after previously allowing foreign-owned vessels to operate relatively freely within the country. In the Philippines, the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 1937) which is also known as the Cabotage Law restricts coastwise trade or the transport of passengers and goods within the country, to vessels with Philippine registry which has to secure a coastwise license from the Maritime Industry Authority. After the passage of Foreign Ships Co-Loading Act or the Republic Act No. 10668 in 2015, foreign vessels with cargo intended to be exported out the country may dock in multiple ports in the country before transiting to a foreign port. In the EU, rights to cabotage in newly-admitted member states (in particular, Greece, Spain and Portugal) were restricted;EU derogations but this introductory provision was abandoned after criticism in the light of the Paros ferry disaster.Paros ferry disaster The Hague‚ÄìVisby Rules, a convention which imposes duties on maritime carriers, apply only to \\"carriage of goods by sea between ports in two different states\\", and thus do not apply to cabotage shipping.Hague-Visby rules, Article X However, section 1(3) of the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 declares that the Rules \\"shall have effect ‚Ä¶ where the port of shipment is a port in the United Kingdom, whether or not the carriage is between ports in two different States ‚Ä¶\\". In passenger aviation Cabotage rights remain rare in passenger aviation. The Chicago Convention prohibits member states from granting cabotage on an exclusive basis, which has limited the availability of cabotage as a bargaining chip in bilateral aviation agreement negotiations. Cabotage is not granted under most open skies agreements. =European Union= Carriers licensed under EU law are permitted to engage in cabotage in any EU member state, with some limitations.\\"Cabotage\\" European Commission. Ryanair, easyJet, Vueling, Wizz Air, and Aer Lingus have bases and operate domestic services outside their home countries. =Australia and New Zealand= The Closer Economic Relations agreement allows Australian air carriers to fly domestically and internationally from New Zealand and vice versa. An Australian carrier, Jetstar (a Qantas subsidiary), flies domestic routes within New Zealand. Air New Zealand offers one international destination from Australia outside New Zealand, flying between Sydney, Australia and Rarotonga of the Cook Islands. Air New Zealand also flies one domestic route in Australia, between Sydney, Australia and Norfolk Island, Australia. Previously, Qantas Jetconnect, Pacific Blue (a Virgin Australia subsidiary) and Ansett New Zealand were Australian-owned airlines based in New Zealand that operated domestic New Zealand services. Australia also permits foreign-owned airlines incorporated under Australian law (such as the domestic arm of Virgin Australia) to operate on domestic routes, although it prohibits such airlines from operating international routes as Australian flag carriers. They can, however still operate international routes if they are operated by an Australian-owned subsidiary. =Chile= Chile has the most liberal cabotage rules in the world, enacted in 1979, which allow foreign airlines to operate domestic flights, conditional upon reciprocal treatment for Chilean carriers in the foreign airline's country. This unusual regime is partly due to Chile's geographical need for air service, and partly to incentivize liberalization in other countries amid the international expansion of its flag carrier LATAM Chile, which now has major operations in many other Latin American countries. Like Australia, Chile allows foreign companies to set up Chilean subsidiaries to offer domestic flights in Chile, regardless of reciprocity. =Other examples= Before 1991, Lufthansa was prohibited from flying to West Berlin, so Pan Am, British Airways, and Air France operated the routes between West Germany and West Berlin. For a short time in the late 1980s, Trans World Airlines also flew between then-West Germany and West Berlin. During this time, Pan Am flew to Tegel, in Berlin, from Munich-Riem Airport (now closed), Hamburg and Frankfurt. Air France flew from D√ºsseldorf. British Airways flew from M√ºnster-Osnabr√ºck, Hannover, and some other cities. In 2003-2004, the United States Department of Transportation authorized Polynesian Airlines to provide temporary cabotage service in American Samoa after the existing US flag carrier ceased operations, one of very few instances where the US has granted cabotage rights in an emergency. In October 2007, the United Kingdom granted Singapore carriers the right to fly domestic UK routes as part of an open skies agreement, which also allows British carriers to fly to any city from Singapore. Reciprocal cabotage rights exist by treaty between New Zealand and Brunei and between the People's Republic of China and Albania. Related concepts\\"Modified sixth freedom\\"= The \\"modified sixth freedom\\" refers to the right to carry passengers between two points in country A through a hub in country B; for instance, a Boston-Toronto-Seattle itinerary. Such services are currently considered to constitute cabotage and are not permitted. In 2002, the United States fined Asiana Airlines for selling tickets from the mainland US to Guam and Saipan via Seoul. =Tag rights= Certain airlines operate services within a foreign country without the right to carry local traffic. For instance, Qantas operates service between New York and Los Angeles solely for use by international connecting passengers. Such services are not generally considered to be cabotage. In road transport The European Union allows limited cabotage for road transport. A non-resident carrier which has driven to another EU country is allowed pick up and deliver a further load inside the host country before returning to the border.International and cabotage road transport ReferencesExternal links *European Commission > 3rd railway package including cabotage *\\"European transport policy for 2010 : time to decide\\" European Union Commission White paper Category:Business terms Category:Political terminology Category:International law Category:International trade Category:Freight transport Category:Civil aviation ","title":"Cabotage"},{"id":"1624960","text":"Montfoort's rendering of the Hellespontine Sibyl Statue in Scalzi, Venice The Hellespontine Sibyl was the priestess presiding over the Apollonian oracle at Dardania.

Matthews, Terrence \\"Dresser\\" Williams, and Eddie King Jr. perform at a Battle of the Bands contest as The Heartbeats. The group loses to Flash and the Ebony Sparks but pleases the crowd and is noticed by Jimmy Potter. Jimmy offers to manage the group, promising them $100 if they do not win the next month's Battle of the Bands contest. After the group loses, Jimmy pays them. When the owner of the club asks to hire them, they agree to let Jimmy manage them. Bird and The Midnight Falcons witness the Heartbeats rehearsing for a competition and are concerned they could lose; frontman Victor \\"Bird\\" Thomas asks his girlfriend to invite her friends and boo The Heartbeats while cheering The Falcons. The announcer, a cousin of one of the Falcons, forces The Heartbeats to use the house piano player. Duck grows frustrated with the house player's poor playing, and shoves him off the piano stool. Eddie leads the group in a number that results in Bird's girlfriend fainting in Eddie's arms. The Heartbeats win the contest and the interest of Big Red Davis, who owns Big Red Records. Big Red offers them a deal, but Jimmy and his wife Eleanor, aware of Big Red's corruption, decline. The group instead releases their first single on Jimmy's own independent label and searches for a record company they can trust, but no one else is interested aside from a label which wants to buy Duck's songs for a group they've already signed, The Five Horsemen, prompting the Heartbeats to sign with Big Red. The group goes on the road, but the travel is marred by racism and poor living conditions. Dresser's girlfriend visits and reveals she is pregnant, and the group is faced with their first album cover featuring white people, despite the label having earlier approved a photo of the Heartbeats as the cover. Throughout the mid-to-late 1960s The Five Heartbeats receive numerous awards, chart several hits, and are featured on magazine covers. Eddie, however, starts abusing alcohol and cocaine, affecting his performance and prompting his girlfriend Baby Doll to break up with him. Convinced that Jimmy intends to replace him due to his deteriorating condition, he cuts a deal with Big Red to have Jimmy cut out of his contract. In retaliation, Jimmy threatens to go to the authorities with information about bootlegged LPs, cooked books, and payola that could have Big Red arrested, leading Red to have Jimmy killed in a hit disguised as an accident. Soon after Jimmy's funeral, the group learns that Eddie's deceit caused the fallout between Jimmy and Big Red. Big Red is eventually convicted of Jimmy's murder, forcing the group to sign with a new record label, and causing a guilt-ridden Eddie to leave in disgrace. By the early 1970s, Eddie has turned up at several Heartbeats concerts to try to convince his friends to let him back into the group, but his substance abuse has taken its toll on him by this time, and all the other Heartbeats can do is supply him with money out of sympathy; Duck later hears on the radio that Eddie was involved in an armed robbery and, after a shootout with the police, was in critical condition. The Heartbeats add Flash as their lead singer. Duck comes to suspect his fianc√©, Tanya Sawyer, is having an affair with Choirboy. He follows her to a hotel, only to discover that Tanya is meeting with J.T., not Choirboy. Tanya's relationship with J.T. predates her relationship with Duck, but she says she is now in love with Duck. J.T. urges Tanya to disclose the affair, but she refuses. At an awards ceremony celebrating their success, Flash announces he is going solo. Duck reveals that he knows about Tanya and J.T. and also leaves the group, resulting in the Heartbeats' disbandment. The film then skips ahead to the early 1990s. Choirboy, true to his nickname, has returned to singing in his father's church. After converting to Christianity, Eddie has since become clean and sober. He is now married to Baby Doll, sings in Choirboy's choir, and manages a group. He asks Duck to write songs for them, to which Duck agrees. J.T. has a wife and two children, including a son named \\"Duck\\". The brothers reconcile. The only member to have maintained a singing career is Flash, who transitioned from doo-wop to pop music, and is part of the group Flash and The Five Horsemen. At a family gathering, Eleanor Potter, coming to terms with her husband's death, forgives Eddie. The Five Heartbeats reunite in front of their families and friends, as they try to show off their old moves. Cast and charactersThe Five Heartbeats= *Robert Townsend as Donald \\"Duck\\" Matthews: Duck hails from a poor family. He is The Five Heartbeats' co- founder and brother of fellow Heartbeat's member J.T. Matthews, and originally was only the composer and musician for the group.

Matthews: J.T. is the older brother of Duck. A womanizer; he and his brother Duck share a close and sometimes turbulent relationship. *Michael Wright as Eddie King, Jr.: Eddie comes from an area that features predominantly poor individuals, his own father believing his attempts to start a career in the music industry will be unsuccessful. He is one of the founding members of The Heartbeats and serves as the crowd pleaser whose voice leads to success in many of their performances. Similar to David Ruffin, Eddie is the lead vocalist of the band and falls into a life of drugs and alcohol that eventually leads to his expulsion from the group as well as emotional trauma. After hitting rock-bottom several times, he eventually converts to Christianity, cleans and sobers himself up, marries his longtime sweetheart Baby Doll, and manages his own group. * *Tico Wells as Anthony \\"Choirboy\\" Stone: Stone is given the nickname \\"Choirboy\\" (much to his chagrin) for his past as a choir boy in his father's church. Similar to Eddie, Stone's father does not support his decision to become a music artist fearing rock and jazz are \\"the devil's music.\\" He becomes more of a womanizer as the group becomes more successful, but later goes back to being a part of his father's ministry after the group disbands. *Harry J. Lennix as Terrence \\"Dresser\\" Williams: The original choreographer of The Heartbeats, Dresser serves as the groups bass singer and one of the founding members.

Flash later becomes the lead singer for the Five Heartbeats. Production After writing (along with Keenen Ivory Wayans), producing, directing, and starring in his first film Hollywood Shuffle, Robert Townsend had attained near-cult status among independent filmmakers due to his dedication to that film‚Äîa project which caused him to max out all his credit cards and spend nearly $100,000 of his own money raised through savings and various acting jobs in order to produce the film. When writing Townsend's first studio film The Five Heartbeats, Townsend and Wayans kept comedy an important aspect of the film, but also explored complex characters in a more dramatic way.https://books.google.com/books?id=5YWgxVkJmT4C&pg;=PA220&dq;=the+five+heartbeats&lr;=&sig;=ACfU3U0Nl- quxN9UYyRjd5Q6i_fBRfUcNw#PPA220,M1 The Five Heartbeats was originally set up as a development deal at Warner Bros. in 1988, with Keenan Ivory Wayans, his brother Damon, and others tapped to star. Warner passed on the project, and the Wayans moved on to develop and star in the Fox sketch comedy show In Living Color instead. Townsend resurrected Heartbeats at 20th Century Fox in 1990. The original screenplay had been inspired by the lives and careers of Motown group The Temptations, and Townsend had met with former lead singers David Ruffin and Eddie Kendrick with the intention of hiring them as technical advisors. Fox vetoed bringing Ruffin and Kendrick onto the production, for fear that Motown founder Berry Gordy, Jr. might sue the studio. Rhythm and blues-singing group The Dells, who were renowned for their four-decade career, became the technical advisors instead. Townsend used his film to depict a similar story to the careers of the Temptations and the Dells, following the lives of three friends who aspire to musical stardom.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/five_heartbeats/# Given the setting of the film, he was able to tie in other elements, such as race relations, as well. Due to the production's budgetary constraints, Townsend used little- known actors of the time, with the exceptions of Leon Robinson, Diahann Carroll and Harold Nicholas of The Nicholas Brothers.http://www.vh1.com/movies/movie/11969/castcrew.jhtml Townsend had considered Denzel Washington as Eddie Kane, Jr. and Whitney Houston as Baby Doll. The former was not cast due to budget concerns and the latter passed on the role as it was felt to be too small. =Promotion= To promote the film prior to its release, Townsend, along with the other actors who portrayed the fictional musical quartet The Five Heartbeats (Leon Robinson, Michael Wright, Harry J. Lennix, and Tico Wells) performed in a concert with real-life Soul/R&B; vocal group The Dells, one of many groups that inspired the film. The Dells sang and recorded the vocals as the actors lip synced.https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,313030,00.html Soundtrack A soundtrack for the film was released by Virgin Records, featuring original music by various artists. Both \\"Nights like This\\" and \\"A Heart Is a House for Love\\" became top 20 hits on the U.S. Billboard Hot R&B; Singles chart.

He was Labor Premier of New South Wales from 30 April 1964 to 13 May 1965. He was the first New South Wales Premier born in the 20th century. Early life Jack Renshaw was born on 8 August 1909 near Wellington in central New South Wales. His parents were John Ignatius Renshaw and Ann Renshaw (n√©e Reidy). When he was six his parents took up a selection near the town of Binnaway. Five years later his father died in a farm accident, leaving his widow to raise eight children. Following Ann Renshaw's remarriage the family prospered and came to own a fuel depot, stock and station agency and butchery in the town. Renshaw was educated at Binnaway Central School, Patrician Brothers at Orange (where he lived with his grandmother), and then Holy Cross College at Ryde in north-western Sydney. After leaving school at the age of 14 he helped to run the family dairy property at Hampden Park, and also helped operate a milk run out of Binnaway. Renshaw joined the Binnaway branch of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in 1930, and soon held office in the branch. He also served on the state and federal electorate councils in the area, including as President of the Gwydir Electorate Council from 1939 to 1949. He was active in local government, serving as an councillor (C Riding) in the Coonabarabran Shire Council from 1937 to 1944. From 1939 to 1941 he was Shire President, becoming the youngest shire president in Australia at the time. He resigned as Shire President in May 1941 following his election to state Parliament. During the late 1930s he also held a position on the Northern Executive of the Wheat Growers' Union. In 1939 he volunteered for service in World War II but was rejected due to a defect in his eyesight. Political career Renshaw was encouraged to run for state parliament in the local seat of Castlereagh by William Scully, the federal member for Gwydir, after Renshaw had worked as campaign director for him. He was supported by the Premier, William McKell, who realised that Renshaw's strong local identity and links to the farming community would help him in an election. Renshaw stood in the 1941 election, winning the seat from the Country Party member, Alfred Yeo, who had held Castlereagh for the previous nine years. From 1945 to 1950 Renshaw was a member of the central executive of the NSW ALP. Renshaw was appointed Secretary for Lands in 1950 under Premier James McGirr. Relying upon his strong knowledge of agricultural and rural issues, he aggressively prosecuted the case for Labor's policy of compulsory resumption of large properties so that they could be subdivided. At the time it was believed the land was being under-utilised by land speculators and large agricultural companies and that closer settlement would promote the development of rural districts and solve post-war food shortages. The policy was opposed by the wealthier graziers, represented in part by the Country Party and the United Farmers' Association. Impressed by his handling of the closer settlement debate, the new Premier Joe Cahill promoted Renshaw to Secretary for Public Works in 1952. He also became Minister for Local Government in 1953, later transferring from Public Works to Minister for Highways in 1956. Renshaw went on to serve as Deputy Premier from 1959 to 1964 (when Bob Heffron was Premier), and Treasurer from 1959 to 1965. He also served as Minister for Lands from 1960 to 1961, Minister for Agriculture from 1961 to 1962 and Minister for Industrial Development and Decentralisation from 1962 to 1965. Premier of New South Wales Renshaw as NSW Opposition Leader in January 1968. When Heffron retired in April 1964, Renshaw became Premier. This tenure proved to be no more than a stopgap for a party increasingly seen as tired and unfocused after being in office since 1941. Of the 16 members in Renshaw's cabinet, six were aged 65 years or more, and most had been in cabinet during Labor's entire quarter-century run in government. Renshaw waited as long as he could before calling an election for 1 May 1965. The Liberal leader, Bob Askin, often used the slogan \\"Twenty-four years of Labor misrule.\\"Dutton, Geoffrey and Harris, Max (eds.), Sir Henry, Bjelke, Don-Baby and Friends (Melbourne: Sun Books, 1971), p. 163. Renshaw found it difficult to connect with urban voters, and his problems in adjusting to the new pressures of television only exacerbated his electoral failings. By contrast, Askin showed substantial skill with the TV medium. At the election, Labor suffered a nine- seat swing against it. The Coalition garnered the support of two conservative independents, allowing Askin to become Premier. For the first time in 24 years, the ALP was out of office in New South Wales. With his federal party colleagues having been in opposition since 1949, Renshaw is to date the last Labor Premier who did not encounter a Labor Prime Minister during his time in office. Renshaw suffered a second and still more severe electoral defeat at the hands of Askin in 1968. He resigned soon after this election, and was succeeded by former Deputy Premier Pat Hills. Nevertheless, Renshaw remained an important figure both in the state parliament and in Labor's ruling circles; he served as Treasurer during the first four years (1976‚Äì80) of Neville Wran's administration. After that he was the state's Agent-General in London, holding that office till 1983. Personal life On 12 November 1942 Renshaw married Hilda May Wall, at St Canice's Catholic Church, Elizabeth Bay; by her he had a son. Wall died in April 1964, just weeks before Renshaw was sworn in as Premier. His second wife, whom he married on 11 April 1966 at Holy Cross Catholic Church, Woollahra, was Marjorie (Meg) Mackay n√©e Nolan (who had four children in total: one by Renshaw, three by a previous marriage). He died at the age of 77 in 1987 in the northern Sydney suburb of Northbridge. Honours * In the Australia Day Honours of 1979, he was named a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC). * John Renshaw Drive, a section of road in the Hunter Region, adjoining the Pacific Highway is named in Renshaw's honour. * Jack Renshaw Bridge across the Castlereagh River at Gilgandra is named in his honour.

The character has been depicted as a member of the Thunderbolts and Young Allies. Fictional character biography Hallie Takahama was born in Ojai, California before moving with her parents to New York City at a young age. A super hero buff, she memorized details about various superhuman battles. On her 15th birthday, Sentinels controlled by Onslaught destroyed her apartment, killing her parents and friends, and for weeks Hallie hid in the ruins of the city with several children she rescued.Thunderbolts #1, #4, and #33 When Hallie went to seek help after Onslaught's defeat, she and all the children she was protecting were kidnapped by the mercenary group the Rat Pack and experimented on by the Rat Pack's employer, Arnim Zola. The other children died or were horribly mutated, but Hallie became faster, stronger, and gained the ability to throw bio-electric punches. She escaped and attempted to reach the Fantastic Four. Having been isolated between the destruction and the experiments, she had not known that many superheroes, including the Fantastic Four and most of the Avengers, had been whisked to a Pocket Universe created by Franklin Richards, the son of Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman of the Fantastic Four. The world at large presumed the heroes dead. When Hallie reached Four Freedom Plaza, the Fantastic Four's old headquarters, she encountered the Thunderbolts, a new super team who were in fact the sixth incarnation of Masters of Evil led by Baron Helmut Zemo under the alias of Citizen V and also consisting of Atlas, MACH-V, Meteorite, Songbird, and Techno.Thunderbolts #3-4 She joined the team,Thunderbolts #4 and eventually convinced most of the now-wavering former villains to become heroes.Thunderbolts #11 She went on the run with the team.Thunderbolts #15-20 before Hawkeye joined. At first she resented Hawkeye because he created civilian identities for Charcoal and Jolt and made them return to school but she later admitted that she respected him for having been where the Thunderbolts were and giving them that same chance to redeem themselves that he had been given.Thunderbolts #27, #35 Later she would be \\"killed\\" by Scourge.Thunderbolts #34-35 Revived by Techno, she could now become a being of pure electricity, but the damage from the time she spent \\"dead\\" left her crippled in her human form,Thunderbolts #48 although after much therapy, she fully recovered.Thunderbolts #51 After being stranded on Counter-Earth with most of the Thunderbolts, she chose to stay behind to help the devastated planet as one of the Young Allies.Thunderbolts #60-75 However, Jolt made a brief return to Earth, in order to help both the Thunderbolts and Avengers to stop the out-of-control Moonstone (who had possessed two moonstones at the time and was losing control when she absorbed the Liberator's energies within her).Avengers/Thunderbolts #5-6 At the time when Atlas was fighting Baron Helmut Zemo's third incarnation of the Masters of Evil, Jolt showed up to help Atlas fight the Masters of Evil.Thunderbolts Vol. 3 #10 Relationships with the other Thunderbolts Hallie was particularly close to her teammates Atlas and Charcoal. Atlas saw her as a surrogate sister who reminded him of his dead sister Lindy. Charcoal took her \\"death\\" extremely hard. She was also originally close with Meteorite who was a surrogate mother of sorts to Hallie before she was revealed to be the super villain Moonstone and Jolt came to understand how duplicitous Moonstone really was. Baron Helmut Zemo hated Jolt from the very beginning realizing fairly quickly that Moonstone was using Jolt's good influence to undermine his control of the Thunderbolts. Powers and abilities Originally, Jolt possessed hyperkinetic agility and could move with amazing speed and jump vast distances. Her hyperactive metabolism made her body's natural bioelectric field exceptionally powerful, and she could shock enemies with a touch. Moreover, Techno stated that she could transform any kind of energy into physical strength and speed, and that with an unlimited source of energy she would be able to use her powers with no physical strain whatsoever. After her \\"rebirth\\", Jolt could change from flesh- and-blood into living electricity. In her energy form, she could fly and fire blasts of electrical force. At first, she could only function in her electric form, her human form was so injured that she could barely walk and talk. She has now fully recovered, and her level of power has increased. Other versionsMC2= While not appearing often, Jolt was member of the Avengers before the current team was formed in A-Next #1.A-Next #1 =Marvel Adventures Iron Man= Jolt appeared in Marvel Adventures: Iron Man #8, but not as a superheroine. Instead, she was an assassin hired by Justin Hammer. Hammer wanted her to take out both Iron Man and Tony Stark as Hammer was being charged for trying to frame Iron Man and causing a lot of damage to New York City (this took place in Marvel Adventures: Iron Man #4, where Iron Man fought the Spymaster) and Tony Stark was going to testify against Hammer. Jolt appeared in her bio-electric form, but had the same powers as the Marvel-616 Jolt. =Marvel Zombies= Jolt was part of a team of zombified Thunderbolts in Marvel Zombies: Dead Days. She, along with the rest of the team, is seen trying to infect Thor, but they are stopped by Nova, and ultimately killed.

In 2016, the town had a population of 425 people. The road linking these two towns closely follows the meandering Castlereagh River. There are many pleasant areas to stop beside the road and on the river banks to have a picnic. Binnaway is also located near the similarly sized small town of Mendooran. Following local government amalgamation, the town is now located in the Warrumbungle Shire Council area which is headquartered at Coonabarabran. History The name Binnaway may derive from an Aboriginal term which means peppermint tree. The first European landholder in the areas was Charles Naseby who claimed 50 acres (200,000 m¬≤) in 1869. The village of Binnaway was initially set up on his land with a plan for the town being laid out in 1876. A street in the town is named Renshaw Street after the former Premier of New South Wales Jack Renshaw who grew up and went to school in the area. A film called The Shiralee based on a D'Arcy Niland novel set in the Australian bush, which starred Peter Finch, was filmed around Binnaway in the 1950s. Binnaway was once a major railway town and contained a large wheat receival area. The railway still continues to operate through the town between Dubbo and the Binnaway to Werris Creek line. Binnaway was also home to Frank Bourke's famous White Rose Orchestra and the Big Piano. Amenities Binnaway Bombshells play in the Castlereagh Cup rugby league competition. The Binnaway Bowling club is located at the southern end of the town. Other sports active in Binnaway are cricket, fishing, golf, pony riding, squash, tennis and swimming.http://www.nnsw.com.au/binnaway/sport.html There are also a number of popular 4-wheel drive and motocross tracks to explore.

Military career Born in Marblehead, Massachusetts, Tucker began his naval career in the spring of 1760 as a cabin boy in the warship, King George. He subsequently rose to command of a merchant ship in July 1774. Tucker was in England at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, but returned to Massachusetts in the autumn of 1775. Upon his return, Tucker was selected by General George Washington to command a small flotilla of armed schooners which Washington had purchased and fitted out to prey on the British shipping. Tucker also served as commanding officer of the schooner Franklin. In Franklin and later in schooner Hancock, Tucker cruised off the Massachusetts coast, taking many prizes in the year 1776. His first, taken jointly with the schooner Lee, came on 29 February, when the two Continental ships cornered the 300-ton Henry and Esther, bound for Boston laden with wood from Halifax, Nova Scotia. In April 1776, in Hancock, Tucker sighted two supply brigs making for Boston. Standing in to the harbor, near the protecting cannon of British warships anchored in the roadstead, he soon captured brigs Jane and William, out of Ireland. Tucker took both, escaping with the two ships and their valuable cargoes of foodstuffs and other items needed by the Continental Army. On 15 March 1777 Tucker received a commission in the Continental Navy, and in September 1777 replaced Captain Hector McNeill in command of the new frigate Boston, following McNeill's suspension from duty. For the remainder of 1777, Tucker, in Boston, carried out commerce-raiding forays in the North Atlantic and off the northeast coasts before being selected for a special mission. On 15 February 1778, Capt. Samuel Tucker sailed from Braintree, Massachusetts, to take onboard John Adams, the newly appointed minister to France, and his son, John Quincy. Later, in remarks before the Navy Board, Tucker would say of Adams, \\"I did not say much to him at first, but damn and bugger my eyes, I found him after a while as sociable as any Marblehead man.\\"John Adams by David McCullough, Simon and Schuster Paperbacks, New York, 2001. Pg 183. Halfway across the Atlantic, Boston was nearly dismasted in a lightning storm that injured 20 sailors. According to John Adams' diary, one of the sailors had a hole burnt in the top of his head from the lightning, and soon died \\"raving mad.\\" On another occasion, three British warships gave chase to the frigate. Avoiding contact with British ships as much as possible, Tucker was finally forced to fight. Encountering the British letter of marque (privateer) Martha, Tucker maneuvered Boston to cross the enemy's \\"T.\\" Boston's guns thundered and sent shot down the length of the Britisher, and soon Martha, after a single ineffectual broadside, struck her colors. The Adams' arrived safely at Bordeaux on 1 April. Cruising in European waters from the spring of 1778 until the fall of that year, Tucker took four more prizes before returning to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 15 October. In 1779, two cruises in the North Atlantic netted nine prizes before orders sent Boston to Charleston, South Carolina, to help defend that port against the British onslaught. On 11 May 1780, Charleston surrendered, after a siege, and the warships in harbor were captured, along with most of their officers and men. Tucker was among the prisoners but received parole on 20 May and was exchanged for British Capt. Wardlaw, whom Tucker had captured when Boston took HMS Thorn in September 1779. On 11 January 1781, Tucker assumed command of Thorn, now a privateer. After taking seven prizes, he was again captured in an engagement with HMS Hind (1740) off the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. He and his crew were taken to Prince Edward Island. One day, having had permission to go to Halifax, Tucker escaped and made his way to Boston. In an era where chivalry in war was still alive, Tucker wrote a letter of apology to the British garrison commander for his escape. At his own request, Tucker was paroled. When the war had ended, Tucker received hearty thanks from Congress. During the years following the establishment of peace, the old mariner from Marblehead sailed packets from America to Bremen, Germany, until he retired to farming, in Maine, in 1792. In the War of 1812, Tucker returned to active service, commanding a schooner which protected the coast of Maine from British privateers. In 1813, he captured the British privateer Crown in a short, sharp engagement. Personal life Changing his residence to Massachusetts, Tucker settled down once again to a life of farming. In 1823, he was awarded a small pension, retroactive to 1818. In 1768 Tucker married Mary Gatchell, daughter of Ann and Samuel Gatchell, a Congregationalist Church Deacon from Marblehead. The Tuckers were married for 63 years until her death. When the Tuckers were living in Boston they \\"attended the Episcopal Church, of which [his wife] was a communicant.

Biography After graduating from high school, Mohammad Hashim became a journalist, editing several newspapers. During the 1950s, he was appointed as an Afghan ambassador to Britain, the United States and Pakistan alternately from 1955 to 1963. In October 1965, following the election of the new legislature, an impasse over its approval of the new cabinet brought rioting and an intervention by the army, leading to the death of at least three student demonstrators. The proposed cabinet was withdrawn, and the constitution of a new one under the leadership of Muhammad Hashim Maiwandwal, a senior diplomat, was approved with little opposition. Nominated by the King, he quickly established friendly relations with the students, while making it clear that he was in charge and there were going to be limits to student political activity. He served as prime minister of Afghanistan from November 2, 1965 until October 11, 1967. He resigned due to ill health. Maiwandwal had no children, and he left all his property his nephew, who had moved to Canada, but it was taken by the state. In 1966 he founded the Jam‚Äôiat Demokrate-ye Mottaraqi (Progressive Democratic Party), a leftist monarchist party. It advocated evolutionary socialism and parliamentary democracy. Maiwandwal, who was elected in 1965, lost his seat when the government selectively influenced the elections. =Arrest and death= The rise of Mohammad Daoud Khan to power after the 1973 coup was galling to other would-be successors, such as Sardar Abdul Wali who was quickly put behind bars. A coup attempt, which may have been planned before Daoud took power, was subdued shortly after his coup. Whether Maiwandwal was in on the plot from the start is open to question, but his pro-western reputation may explain why he was chosen for its leadership. This led to the arrest of Maiwandwal and twenty others on September 20, 1973, including the newly promoted chief of air staff, two serving lieutenant generals, five colonels and one member of the now defunct Wolesi Jirga. On October 1, 1973, he was said to have committed suicide while awaiting trial. He died in prison at a time when Parchamites controlled the Ministry of Interior under circumstances corroborating the widespread belief that he had been tortured to death. That is the main reason the international community in Kabul believes that he was killed when third degree methods were used to obtain a confession. He actually died from internal haemorrhages resulting from being kicked in the abdomen by the chief Parchamite in charge of his interrogation, while lying on the floor as a result of previous blows. His body was secretly buried by the police department in the Shuhada-e Saliheen graveyard in southern Kabul, which was discovered in 2004 by Daoud Malikyar.Tribute website It has been suggested that Maiwandwal's death at the hands of the Parchamites led to President Daoud Khan to purge Parchamites from his cabinet in the following years.

The band debuted a demo in 1988 titled Lock Up Your Children, licensed by Edge Entertainment to Mexican label Avanzada Met√°lica, where it became their debut album Spectrum of Death in 1990. They were both released separately before the band had signed to a label. In 1992, they released a fan-exclusive demo titled Destruction System as an advance cassette for a planned second full-length, but never was officially released in latter form. A single-sided demo titled The Black Tape was released later that year containing only four tracks from the Destruction System demo. The band then split-up in 1994. In early 2010, Morbid Saint announced their reunion with a new line-up, performing various shows in the U.S. and abroad, including the 2012 edition of Maryland Deathfest, Metal on the Rocks in Mexico City and the 2013 edition of the Keep It True festival in Germany. In 2012, the band released the compilation album Thrashaholic, containing both Spectrum of Death and Destruction System in remastered CD-R format, with four new songs and a live DVD in DVD-R format. In 2014, the band released the live album Beyond the States of Hell, which was recorded live from Beijing. In November 2015, Destruction System was officially released as the band's second full-length album that was originally intended for release in 1992, but went unfinished since then, with new artwork.

A. R. Barker, based on his T√©kumel fictional universe, which was self-published in 1974, then published by TSR, Inc. in 1975. It was one of the first tabletop role-playing games, along with Dungeons & Dragons. Over the subsequent thirty years, several new games were published based on the T√©kumel setting, but to date none have met with commercial success. While published as fantasy, the game is sometimes classified as science fantasy or, debatably, as science fiction. History Origin = University of Minnesota professor M. A. R. Barker, a scholar of ancient languages, had spent decades crafting a fantasy world called T√©kumel, writing thousands of pages of histories, describing its culture, and even constructing its languages. He served as adviser to the university's wargaming club, where a club-mate and role-playing game player Michael Mornard showed him Dungeons & Dragons. Barker first self-published 50 copies of his own role-playing game, Empire of the Petal Throne in 1974, the same year that Dungeons & Dragons was published. This version is now referred to as \\"Manuscript edition\\". Also, \\"Empire of the Petal Throne\\" is a synonym for the Tsoly√°ni Empire in game. Barker also wrote another game based in T√©kumel: a combat-oriented board game, War of Wizards in 1975.\\" = 1975 TSR edition = Empire of the Petal Throne influenced Dave Arneson and Gary Gygax, who were impressed with the game. Barker made his commercial game-design debut at Tactical Studies Rules, Inc., the publishers of Dungeons & Dragons, with Empire of the Petal Throne boxed set in 1975. TSR published Barker's game and setting as a standalone game, rather than as a \\"supplement\\" to the original D&D; rules. The game brought a level of detail and quality to the concept of a campaign setting which had previously been unknown in the nascent RPG industry's publications. The game was the subject of articles in early issues of Dragon magazine, but factors such as inconsistent support from TSR led to its decline in popularity. TSR was locked into a deal that made the financial end of the game unpalatable to them. They had agreed to pay a \\"finder's fee\\" on sales in addition to royalties as well as to certain expensive overrides. As a result, the product was more expensive and thus less profitable. =Later editions= Empire of the Petal Throne was reprinted later as a single book by Different Worlds Publications in 1987. In 2005, the Canadian publisher Guardians of Order produced T√©kumel: Empire of the Petal Throne. The game uses a variation of the Tri-Stat dX system. Genre Empire of the Petal Throne's setting, T√©kumel, used a mixture of fantasy, science fantasy and science fiction backgrounds. Game design Empire of the Petal Throne introduced the concept of critical hits with a 20-sided die. Using these rules a player who rolls a 20 on a 20-sided die does double the normal damage, and a 20 followed by a 19 or 20 counts as a killing blow. According to M.A.R. Barker, \\"this simulates the 'lucky hit' on a vital organ.\\"M.A.R. Barker, Empire of the Petal Throne, p32. (1975 edition); p34. (1987 edition) Reception Rick Mataka reviewed Empire of the Petal Throne in The Space Gamer No. 4 (1976).

The practice serves the purpose of preventing telephone number exhaustion in regions of high growth. The increasing demand for telephone numbers has been primarily caused by increase in use of pagers, fax machines during the 1990s, and proliferation of cellphones and smart phones since. After a numbering plan split is implemented, the telephone numbers in the affected area are changed to a new area code, which requires the printing of new stationery, advertisements, and signage; the dissemination of the new numbers to family, friends, and customers; and the subsequent need to update speed dial programming and address books. Auxiliary devices, such as cellphones, pagers, and fax machines, must be reprogrammed when an area code splits. In a number of areas, rapid growth during the late decades of the 20th century resulted in several splits within a short time, in some cases within a decade. As a result, in the mid-1990s, the North American Numbering Plan Administrator introduced another method called overlay plan, which assigns multiple area codes to the same numbering plan area. This permits customers to keep existing telephone numbers, but it requires ten-digit dialing for customers of both area codes. Since 2007, most territories use overlays for mitigating numbering shortages.

The orthodox position is that women cannot lead prayers, which is justified by the different roles that men and women take in society. A small number of schools of Islamic thought make exceptions for taraawih (optional Ramadan prayers) or for a congregation consisting only of close relatives. Women acting as leaders, teachers, and authorities in other capacities however is not deviating from the Islamic orthodoxy as women have never been restricted from becoming scholars, ulema, jurists, muftis, preachers, missionaries, or spiritual guides. There is a long history of female masters of Islamic sciences teaching men - the four imams of Sunni orthodoxy (Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Maalik, Imam Shafi'i, and Imam Ahmad) all were taught by women. Historically, certain sects have considered it acceptable for women to function as imams. This was true not only in the Arab heartland of early Islam, but in China over recent centuries, where women's mosques developed. The debate has been reactivated during the 21st century as the west and the world revisit sexism. Those critical of the ruling that women cannot lead congressional prayers have argued that the spirit of the Qur'an and the letter of a da'if (weak) hadith (saying of Mohammed) indicate that women should be able to lead mixed (albeit children) congregations, as opposed to sex- segregated congregations, and they suggest that the prohibition against the practice originated from sexism in the medieval environment and from inaccurate patriarchal interpretations of religious texts, rather than from a spirit of \\"true Islam\\". Those who reply to these arguments typically mention that Islam has a long history of female scholarship and legal rulings and they claim that unlike other religions Islam never had a male dominated class of jurists. They also put suggest that the arguments of those who support female leadership of congressional prayer often criticize the entire history of Islamic scholarship with sweeping accusations of patriarchy or sexism rather than pointing to jurisprudential methodologies or preexisting legal opinions, especially as preexisting rulings are the foundation of all judicial systems, and carry a lot of weight when jurists are considering new rulings. Precedents The Qur'an does not address this issue; relevant precedents are therefore sought for in the hadith, the traditions attributed to Muhammad; the sunnah, his actions, including but not limited to hadith; and the principle of ijma, consensus. An indirectly relevant hadith is widely considered to be crucial, since the imam stands at the front of the congregation. The hadith in question is #881 of Sahih Muslim: \\"Abu Huraira said: The best rows for men are the first rows, as opposed to the last ones, and the best rows for women are the last ones as opposed to the first ones.\\" The hadith of Umm Waraqa has given rise to debates among Islamic leaders on whether it is acceptable or not for women to lead prayers, including mixed-gender congregational prayer. Umm Waraqa bint Abdallah, an Ansari woman, who knew the entire Quran, was instructed by Muhammad to lead ahl dariha, which consisted of both men and women, in prayer. The Arabic phrase means \\"the people of her home\\", but the ambiguity hangs on the exact translation of dar, \\"home\\", which can refer to one's residence, neighborhood, or village. The \\"people of Umm Waraqa‚Äôs home\\" were so numerous that Muhammad appointed a muezzin to call them to prayer. Umm Waraqa was one of the few to hand down the Quran before it was recorded in writing. She could do so because she had memorized the entire corpus.Women in Islam By Wiebke Walther published by Markus Wiener Publishing, 1981, p. 111 (citing Ibn Sad, Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir, vol. 8, p. 335) The use of the word dar in the hadith, when speaking of where the prayer was held, has resulted in different interpretations. A general translation is \\"area\\", constituting the community around where Umm Waraqa lived. This idea is not accepted by many scholars. Another translation is dar is \\"household\\", which would mean that Umm Waraqa led prayers in her home. Who was she leading? Imam Zaid presents three possibilities: the two servants of her household and the mu'ahdhin, or the women of her surrounding ‚Äúarea‚Äù, or only the women of her household. Each of these possibilities requires certain assumptions, but the most accepted is that Umm Waraqa was leading the women of her household, thus leading to the conclusion that women are allowed to lead prayers of all-female congregations. Zaid insists that if Muhammed established a mosque in the household of a man, which was not uncommon, Itban b. Malik, then he must also have set up women-only congregations. With regard to women leading congregations of women, however, several hadith report that two of Muhammad's wives, Aisha and Umm Salamah, did so, and as a result most madhhabs support this. According to Qaradawi: : The hadith of \`A‚Äôishah and Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with them). \`Abdur-Raziq (5086), Ad-Daraqutni (1/404) and Al- Bayhaqi (3/131) reported from the narration of Abu Hazim Maysarah ibn Habib from Ra‚Äôitah Al-Hanafiyyah from \`A‚Äôishah that she led women in Prayer and stood among them in an obligatory Prayer. Moreover, Ibn Abi Shaybah (2/89) reported from the chain of narrators of Ibn Abi Layla from \`Ata‚Äô that \`A‚Äôishah used to say the Adhan, the Iqamah, and lead women in Prayer while standing among them in the same row. Al-Hakim also reported the same hadith from the chain of narrators of Layth Ibn Abi Sulaim from \`Ata‚Äô, and the wording of the hadith mentioned here is Al-Hakim‚Äôs. : Furthermore, Ash-Shafi\`i (315), Ibn Abi Shaybah (88/2) and \`Abdur-Raziq (5082) reported from two chains of narrators that report the narration of \`Ammar Ad-Dahni in which he stated that a woman from his tribe named Hujayrah narrated that Umm Salamh used to lead women in Prayer while standing among them in the same row. : The wording of \`Abdur- Raziq for the same hadith is as follows: ‚ÄúUmm Salamah led us (women) in the \`Asr Prayer and stood among us (in the same row).‚Äù : In addition, Al-Hafiz said in Ad-Dirayah (1/169), ‚ÄúMuhammad ibn Al-Husain reported from the narration of Ibrahim An-Nakh\`i that \`A‚Äôishah used to lead women in Prayer during the month of Ramadan while standing among them in the same row. : Further, \`Abdur-Raziq reported (5083) from the narration of Ibrahim ibn Muhammad from Dawud ibn Al-Husain from \`Ikrimah from Ibn \`Abbas that the latter said, ‚ÄúA woman can lead women in Prayer while standing between them.‚Äù All of the hadiths state that the given woman leads the other women in prayers while standing among them in the same row, and not standing on the first row of the prayers as imams do. They further state that they were among only women, not male worshippers. Aside from the hadith, there are other sources to consider. The sunnah is a more general source of precedent; it is usually considered to count against women leading mixed congregations, as there are no reports of it happening in Muhammad's time, unless, as Amina Wadud suggested, the aforementioned Umm Waraqah hadith is interpreted to apply to her town rather than to her household alone. A third source of precedent is the principle of ijma‚Äîconsensus‚Äîsupported by the hadith \\"My community will never agree upon an error.\\" This is also generally quoted against the idea of women leading mixed congregations, since the consensus of the traditional jurists is overwhelmingly against the concept; however, supporters of the idea argue that this consensus is not universal. One of the most authoritative overviews of the viewpoints of the classical jurists on whether women may lead the prayer or not is \\"Whether to Keep Women out of the Mosque: A Survey of Medieval Islamic Law\\" written by Christopher Melchert.Melchert, Christopher. \\"Whether to Keep Women out of the Mosque: A Survey of Medieval Islamic Law\\". Pages 59‚Äì69 in Authority, Privacy and Public Order in Islam: Proceedings of the 22nd Congress of l'Union Europ√©enne des Arabisants et Islamisants. Edited by B. Michalak-Pikulska and A. Pikulsi. Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta 148. Leuven: Peeters, 2006. Women-only congregations Schools differ on whether a woman may be imam (leader) of a jama'ah (congregational) prayer if the congregation consists of women alone. Three of the four Sunni madhhabs‚ÄîShafi'is, Hanafis, and Hanbalis‚Äîallow this, although Hanafis consider it to be makrooh, a disliked act. (The fourth division, Malikis, do not permit women to lead women in prayer.) Where it is allowed, the woman stands among the congregation in the front row, instead of alone in front of the congregation. In 2000, six marjas among Iran's Shia leadership declared that they too allowed women to lead a woman-only congregation, reversing a previous ban in that country. An unusual feature of Islam in China is the existence of n√ºsi, mosques solely for women. The imams and all the congregants are women and men are not allowed into the buildings. A handful of women have been trained as imams in order to serve these mosques. However, in at least some communities where these mosques operated, women were not allowed in the men's mosques. In recent years, efforts have been made to establish similar mosques in India and Iran. Mixed-gender congregations Egyptian demonstrators in Tahrir Square, Cairo at prayer. Unusually, the women are in front of the men. On the basis of the following interpretation of the Qur'an, Ibn al-Arabi declares female prayer leadership to be absolutely permissible. \\"There are those who unconditionally permit women to lead men [in prayer], which is my opinion as well. There are those who completely forbid her from such leadership and there are those who permit her to lead women, but not men. The reasoning (behind the unconditional permission) is that the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) testified that some women attained perfection just as he testified regarding some men - even though the later were more than the former. This perfection is in reference to prophecy, and prophecy is leadership (imama), thus a women's leadership (in prayer) is sound. The default state is that her leadership is permissible, and one should not listen to those who prohibit it without proof, for there is no text to support their claim, and any evidence they bring forth [is not female specific, and] could include them in the prohibition as well, thereby neutralizing the evidence in this regard, and maintaining the default state of her leadership's permissibility\\" - Abu 'Abd Allah Muhammad b. 'Ali b. Muhammad Ibn al-' Arabi, Al-Futuhat Al Makiyya. Within the household, if no qualified man is present, is the one exception for women to lead men in prayers.\\"Female Prayer Leadership (Revisited)\\" , New Islamic Directions by Imam Zaid, 2008-04-22. Retrieved on 2008-11-29.] Modern Islamic scholars such as Dr. Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, based on the Umm Waraqah hadith mentioned above, consider it permissible for a knowledgeable woman to lead mixed prayers within her own household, as he considers this to largely obviate the danger of the men being aroused by her presence. In the early years of Islam, the Haruriyyah sect, a branch of the Kharijites movement, founded by Habib ibn-Yazƒ´d al-Har≈´rƒ´, held that it was permissible to entrust the imamate to a woman if she were able to carry out the required duties. In 699 A.D. (77 A.H.), the founder's wife, GhazƒÅla al-Har≈´riyya, even led her male warriors in prayer in Kufa after having controlled the city for a day, following the example of Abu Sufyan's daughter Juwayriyya at the Battle of Yarmuk. Not only did she lead Muslim men in prayer, she recited the two longest chapters in the Quran during that prayer.History of Messengers and Kings, By al-Tabari, 51:80; Ali Masudi, Gardens of Gold, Dar al-Andalus, Beirut, 1965, 3:139 Well-known early jurists ‚Äî including Al-Tabari (838‚Äì932), historian, exegete and founder of a now defunct juristic school; Abu Thawr (764‚Äì854), mufti of Iraq; Al-Muzani (791‚Äì878); and Ibn Arabi (1165‚Äì1240) ‚Äî considered the practice permissible at least for optional (nafl salat) prayers. Al-Muthani (d. 878), student of Shafii and contributor to the establishment of the Shafii juristic school, allowed women to unconditionally lead men in prayer. However, the views of these scholars are not accepted by any major surviving group. A few fatwas exist permitting women to lead a mixed gender congregation regardless of familial relationship. For instance, Dr. Khaled Abou El Fadl recommends that the placement of the imam be made with greater modesty in mind for a female imam. Some traditional scholars caution against Yusuf Qaradawi's methodology and regard him as excessively lenient as he does not limit himself to the positions of the four Sunni schools of fiqh'. Adding to the arguments in favor of woman-led prayer of mixed congregations, Laury Silvers and Ahmed Elewa recently published a detailed article in the Journal of Law and Religion arguing that female imams are permissible in all circumstances. Their abstract reads: :This paper, written five years after the Wadud prayer, presents a survey and analysis of the various responses to female led mixed-gender congregational prayers as well as a legal argument for its default permissibility. We show that, in interpreting the Hadiths on woman-led prayer, Sunni schools of law hold a range of opinions on its permissibility. We discuss how Muslim jurists consider historical needs in their rulings, the role of female modesty in this debate, and the nature of juristic consensus. We present our own argument that unrestricted female prayer leadership is legal by default rather than an innovation as many critics have charged. Finally, we set out our own different positions on the propriety of Muslim women asserting their inclusion in the current situation. In individual countriesBahrain= A woman disguised as a man attempted to deliver a Jum'ah khutbah but was detected by members of the congregation and arrested by the Bahraini police. The incident occurred at one of the biggest mosques in the island state, in front of 7000 worshippers, on the last Friday of Ramadan in 2004. The would-be khatib, wearing full male dress with a false beard and moustache, sat on the mimbar just before speaking, at which point some worshippers realised that the new imam was a woman in disguise. They and the mosque's imam, Sheikh Adnan Al-Qattan, handed the 40-year-old woman over to the police. =Canada= Canadian Muslims have been active in the woman-led prayer movement since 2003 when El-Farouk Khaki organized a woman-led prayer with Ghazala Anwar leading for the Salaam/al-Fatiha International Conference. In 2004, United Muslim Association UMA demonstrated its commitment to having women deliver the sermon and lead the prayer.Rachel Sa, \\"Making history first mosque prayers led by a woman: Mixed-gender service\\", National Post, July 2, 2005Jen Gerson, \\"Woman leads Islamic prayers in mosque, a first for Canada -- Country could become the conscience of the religion, she says in Friday sermon\\", Globe & Mail, July 2, 2005 , Washington Post/Newsweek In that year, 20-year-old Maryam Mirza delivered the second half of the Eid al-Fitr khutbah at the Etobicoke mosque in Toronto, run by the UMA. Later the same year, Yasmin Shadeer led the night isha prayer with her male and female congregants. \\\\- the first recorded occasion in contemporary times where a woman led a congregation in prayer in a mosque. In April 2005, Raheel Raza led Toronto's first woman-led mixed-gender Friday service, delivering the khutbah and leading the prayers of the congregation. The event was organized by the Muslim Canadian Congress to celebrate Earth Day, and was held in the backyard of the downtown Toronto home of activist Tarek Fatah. In July 2005, Pamela K. Taylor, a Muslim convert since 1986, gave the Friday khutbah and led the mixed-gender prayers at the UMA Toronto mosque at the invitation of the Muslim Canadian Congress on Canada Day. In addition to leading the prayers, Taylor also gave a sermon on the importance of equality among people regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, and/or disability., marking the first occasion where a Muslim woman led prayers in an official mosque. In 2006, the former Mufti of Marseille, Soheib Bencheikh, requested that either Raza or Taylor lead him in prayer, which Imam Taylor did during a visit to Canada in February 2006. The prayers were sponsored by the Muslim Canadian Congress and held in a private venue with a mixed gender congregation. In 2007, Imam Taylor let prayers for International Woman's Day hosted by the Canadian Muslim Union From 2008, the Noor Cultural Centre in Toronto has included women on their Board of Khatibs, and women and men alternate giving the call to prayer each week. Women regularly give full length sermons prior to the second adhan, with a male khatib delivering the Arabic portion in brief after the second call until 2012. In 2012, the Noor began having women give the full sermon including the Arabic portions. In 2009, academic Laury Silvers, activist lawyer El-Farouk Khaki and artist Troy Jackson founded the Toronto Unity Mosque, the foundation mosque of El-Tawhid Juma Circle, in downtown Toronto. The circle is gender- equal, lgbtq-affirming, and religiously non-discriminatory. All Muslims are welcome to lead the prayer and give the sermon. It helps set up similar circles when asked: The first two sister circles were founded in Washington D.C. and Atlanta, Georgia, in early 2011. These two communities are now associated with Muslims for Progressive Values. (see USA section below). Since then, Montreal Quebec, London Ontario, and Vancouver B.C. have established gender-equal/lgbtq-affirming prayer communities with El-Tawhid Juma Circle. ETJC maintains a website Juma Circle where resources for establishing mosque communities, learning to lead prayer, give a sermon, engage the Qu'ran, the life of Muhammed, and his family, as well as reviews of books, movies, and websites. Muslims for Progressive Values Canada, an affiliate of Muslims for Progressive Values USA, founded in 2010 by Shahla Khan Salter (chair) leads mixed congregational prayers in Ottawa, Canada. Prayers for MPV Canada have been led by women, including Farhat Rehman and by Zeinab A. =China= A unique feature of Islam in China is the presence of female-only mosques. Among the Hui people, but not other Muslim ethnic minorities such as the Uyghurs, Quranic schools for girls evolved into woman-only mosques and women acted as imams as early as 1820. These imams are known as n√º ahong (Â•≥ÈòøË®á), i.e. \\"female akhoond\\", and they guide female Muslims in worship and prayer. Ahong Du Shuzhen of Kaifeng became the first woman in Henan to perform the Hajj in 1992. Due to Beijing having tight control over religious practices, Chinese Muslims are isolated from Islamic world trends. According to Dr Khaled Abou el Fadl from the University of California in Los Angeles, this explains the situation whereby female imams, an ancient tradition long ended elsewhere, can continue to exist in China. =Denmark= The Mariam mosque in Copenhagen, which was founded by Sherin Khankan in February 2016, has only female imams. The mosque is open to male and female worshippers, with the exception of Friday prayers, which are only open to female worshippers. =France= In 2019 Eva Janadin, Anne-Sophie Monsinay and Kahina Bahloul became the first female imams to lead Muslim prayers in France. =India= In 2018, a woman from Kerala became the first woman imam in the country to lead the Jumu'ah prayer for women and men. =Morocco= Kathleen O'Connor noted in 2009 that a madrasa in Morocco had started training women as Islamic guides (mourchidats). Although, O'Conner's entry may refer to the training of women for pastoral roles as local preachers, not as prayer leaders. The Italian researcher Sara Borrillo studies the 2004 reform of Moroccan Ministry of Islamic Affairs that institutionalized official women preachers with the task to teach other women the \\"right\\" Islam in the mosques. The first official training for mourchidates was established in 2005 and each year since then 50 mourchidates are traineed, together with 150 men preachers that could become imam. No woman in Morocco could become imam nor guide a mixed group in Friday prayer. Women can only lead other women in prayer in private spaces. =South Africa= One of the earliest reported cases of a woman imam in the West occurred in 1995 in Johannesburg, South Africa. For about two years, a congregation met every Friday for the Jum'ah prayer and every night in Ramadan for the special tarƒÅwƒ´h prayer in a building owned by the Muslim Youth Movement of South Africa (MYM). The khutbah for the Jumu'ah was delivered by either a male or female khatib and the imams for the prayer also included men and women. One of the prime movers behind this congregation was Muslim women's rights activist Shamima Shaikh. In January 1998, as per her wishes, one of her four funeral prayers was led by a woman friend, Farhana Ismail.[See Esack, Farid. 2009. 'On being a Muslim', Oneworld. And, Jeenah, Na'eem. 2002. 'The Emergence of Islamic Feminisms in South Africa'. Unpublished MA dissertation, University of the Witwatersrand.] A year earlier, Amina Wadud (see below) became the first woman in South Africa to deliver the jum'ah khutbah, at the Claremont Main Road Mosque in Cape Town. Farid Esack discusses this event in his 1997 book Qur'an, Liberation, and Pluralism. Following that event, both the Claremont Main Road Mosque and Masjidul Islam, in Johannesburg, often have had women speakers for Jum'ah. In January 1998, as per her wishes, one of the four funeral prayers for Ms. Shaikh was led by a female friend. South African Muslims heard their first female-led Jum'ah khutbah in 1994 when African- American Islamic studies professor Amina Wadud spoke at the Claremont Main Road Mosque in Cape Town,One Faith, Many Fragments By Amina Wadud for the University of Pennsylvania (2006) an experience she discusses in Inside the Gender Jihad. Since then, both that mosque and Masjidul Islam in Johannesburg often have women speakers for jum'ah. Scores of South African and foreign women have been hosted in these two mosques since 1994. In 2003, a new venue for Eid prayer was established in Durban, designed to allow families to attend the Eid prayer together in a pleasant and comfortable atmosphere. It is run by Taking Islam to the People. At each Eid salaah there are two khutbahs delivered, one by a male and one by a female. Over the seven years from 2003‚Äì2010, fourteen women have offered khutbah, including Dr. Lubna Nadvi, Zaytun Suleyman, Fatima Seedat, Fatima Hendricks, Dr Mariam Seedat and Zulaykha Mayat.http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/religion/documents/ARISA/2002_M5_farhana.pdf In 2005, Farhana Ismail first officiated at a nikah (wedding) ceremony. She has trained other women to do so; since 2006, Fatima Seedat has officiated at three such ceremonies. =Spain= Spanish Muslims have been some of the greatest supporters of the woman-led prayer movement. Spanish imam Abdennur Prado responded immediately to the controversial prayer by American Amina Wadud (see USA section) with a supportive legal opinion. He was one of the organisers of the October 2005 Islamic feminism conference in Barcelona, the first attended by men and women from around the world, at which Wadud led a mixed gender congregational prayer.Amina Wadud Leads Mixed Gender Friday Prayer in Barcelona¬øQu√© es el feminismo musulm√°n? Por la promoci√≥n de un cambio cultural en favor de la igualdad de g√©neros (Spanish) In 2010, another visiting academic, South African Dr. Sa'diyya Sheikh, gave the khutbah and led the Friday prayer for a mixed congregation. =Turkey= Turkish Muslims are conscious of their influence in interpreting Islam. The state-run mosques have trained hundreds of women as vaizes, a term translated by the BBC as \\"senior imams\\" and by the Washington Times as \\"female preachers\\". The WT says, \\"As well as being preachers, women now have the right to lead groups on the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, and 15 Turkish provinces have women serving as deputy muftis ‚Äî specialists on religious law who monitor the work of imams in mosques. Significantly, given that 70 percent of requests for advice come from women, the assistant muftis have the right to issue fatwas, or religious opinions.\\" According to the Christian Science Monitor, in 2005 \\"Diyanet, a government body that oversees the country's mosques and trains religious leaders, added 150 women preachers across Turkey\\" and has moved on to \\"selecting a group of women who will serve as deputies to muftis, or expounders of religious law. From this post, they'll monitor the work being done by imams in local mosques, particularly as it relates to women.\\". =United Kingdom= British Muslims had their first chance to hear a female- led mixed-gender salat in 2008, when the American scholar Amina Wadud performed the Friday prayer at Oxford's Wolfson College. In 2010 Raheel Raza became the first Muslim-born woman to lead a mixed-gender British congregation through Friday prayers. Since then an Inclusive Mosque was set up and mixed prayers have been held, led by either a woman or a man, ever other Friday and through Ramadan. =United States= Ghazala Anwar led a mixed-gender prayer at the al-Fatiha conference in New York City, in 1999. Pamela Taylor who converted to Islam and is the co-founder of Muslims for Progressive Value held one of the first woman-led mixed prayers around 2005. Taylor believed that men and women should be perceived and treated as equal under Islam which prompted the woman-led mixed prayer on International Women's Day. She also spoke against the exclusion of women in the mosque which is supposed to considered a place of God. In interviews, she has focused on the inequality of locations regarding where women pray; for instance, they are not permitted to pray in main prayer halls and other locations are very crowded with low-quality sound systems. Furthermore, children are also forced into the women's sector of the mosque which make it highly difficult for the women to concentrate while praying. However, it is believed that the first woman in Canada to lead a mixed-prayer is Canadian journalist, Raheel Raza. Raza has also become the first Muslim woman to also lead a mixed-gender predominantly British group. Her prayers and work within the British congregation has allowed scholars to question the relationship between female leadership and the Islamic religion. In 2005, African-American Islamic scholar Amina Wadud led a congregation in Friday prayer and gave a sermon in New York City. Another woman sounded the call to prayer, while not wearing a headscarf, and no curtain divided the men and women. This was not the first woman-led mixed-gender congregational prayer (see the above noted events), but it was the first to gain national and international attention. The prayer was the \\"shot across the bow\\" that galvanized conversations and action concerning women's place in the mosque ultimately leading to the ISNA pamphlet \\"Women Friendly Mosque Initiative\\" and websites such as Side Entrance, increased presence of women in mosques in positions of authority, and most recently the woman-only mosque Women's Mosque of America. The Progressive Muslim Union followed the Wadud prayer with a woman-led prayer initiative. The initiative sought to bring together the varied progressive opinions on the prayer as well as engage more conservative Muslims by encouraging further debate, highlighting legal opinions in support of the prayer (as well as giving space to the overwhelming negative opinions), facilitating Muslims who would like to organize future prayers, and documenting those events as they heard of them. Progressives and others sympathetic to bringing about a transformation of gender privilege in Islam continue to work for the establishment of woman-led prayer. Many perceived the Wadud prayer to be an inevitable reaction to the deplorable situation of women in mosques in North America. The attention garnered by the event forced more conservative Muslim organizations to publicly acknowledge the situation and call for changes. ISNA responded with guidelines for women-friendly mosques. Scholars such as Imam Zaid Shakir and Dr. Louay M. Safi have been calling attention to and working to change mosque conditions for years. Progressives and others would argue, though, that mosque conditions are merely a symptom of a widespread sense of male entitlement following centuries of male privilege in the intellectual and political power centers of Islam. Women continue to lead prayers in the United States in their communities with or without media coverage: Nakia Jackson led Eid prayers in 2006 and 2007, with Laury Silvers giving the khutba. When Nakia Jackson led Laury Silvers in prayer, Silvers was a Muslim and a professor at Skidmore College teaching Islam; it was her first time having a prayer led by a woman in which it was Nakia Jackson. Jackson's leadership as a female in Islam allowed women to challenge the norms of Islamic culture and sparked a movement to break traditional barriers. Unfortunately, her perceived support of institutional transphobia while performing as an ally resulted in disconnect from the most vulnerable in the community. Ultimately, the end goal was to develop a community and global movement that would stimulate and encourage Islamic female leadership that is equal to those of men. Since early 2006, Muslims for Progressive Values has had a continuous gender-equal prayer space in West Hollywood, California. Both men and women are allowed to lead prayers and deliver a khutba. Although congregants may choose to position themselves wherever they like, there is no gender segregation policy during prayer. The first dedicated gender-equal prayer space in the United States was founded by Fatima Thompson and Imam Daayiee Abdullah in Washington D.C., as a sister mosque to the El-Tawhid Juma Circle founded two years previously in Toronto (see above). Imam Pamela K. Taylor led the DC congregation prayers for Eid Ul Adha in 2010 at the All Souls Church. She also gave the inaugural sermon for the MPV mosque in Columbus, OH in 2012 with a sermon focused on God's Love.

His list of work includes illustrations for Dungeons & Dragons, Dragonlance, and his own comic strip series SnarfQuest. He is author of the book Reflections of Myth. Early life and education Elmore was born August 5, 1948, in Louisville, Kentucky, and grew up in Grayson County in midwestern Kentucky. Elmore described his school days by saying, \\"The rural school I attended didn't have any art program, so I spent my time drawing - and daydreaming. I was a pretty bad student ... I was always getting into trouble for drawing in class. I wish I had a quarter for every drawing of mine a teacher destroyed.\\" He majored in art at Western Kentucky University. Career A month after graduating from college, Elmore was drafted into the U.S. Army and stationed in Germany. After leaving the service, Elmore worked as an illustrator for the United States government in the Fort Knox Training Aids Department. Three years later, Elmore turned to freelance work, his art being published in National Lampoon and Heavy Metal magazines. One of Elmore's friends, a fellow government illustrator, introduced him to the Dungeons & Dragons game while Elmore was freelancing. Elmore joined the staff of TSR, Inc., the producers of Dungeons & Dragons, as its first professional illustrator, in November 1981, and created art work for adventure modules, game books, and novels, as well as paintings for posters and calendars. Elmore created the SnarfQuest comic which appeared in Dragon. During the \\"Project Overlord\\" development phase of the Dragonlance setting, Elmore provided the concept artwork which was used to promote Dragonlance to the upper levels of management at TSR. Elmore was in charge of creating a look for the Dragonlance saga, and did many of the early sketches for the series, his first cover appearing on Dragons of Autumn Twilight. British game designer Graeme Davis commented that Elmore \\"... should get some kind of award for drawing so many dragons and making them all different\\". Elmore left TSR in 1987. He has illustrated cards for the Magic: The Gathering collectible card game, and provided cover art for the MMORPG EverQuest. In 1996, Elmore wrote the novel Runes of Autumn with his cousin Robert. Elmore did most of the black-and-white artwork for Marc Miller's role-playing game, Traveller in 1996, published by Imperium Games. In the late 1990s, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman used Elmore's fantasy world, Loerem, in their Sovereign Stone trilogy. In the early 2000s, Elmore drew Snarfquest comics for the short-lived magazine Games Unplugged, published by Ken Whitman's Dynasties Productions; Whitman later acted as product manager for Elmore Production, Elmore's personal art company. Elmore provided the artwork for the fantasy world in the Sovereign Stone Game System (1999). In 2004, Sovereign Press returned the rights for Sovereign Stone to Elmore, who then relicensed the game to the small press company, White Silver Publishing. Elmore scaled back his activities in 2006, switching to contract work only, stating, \\"A friend of mine, Keith Parkinson, who also worked at TSR, died of leukemia three years ago. We shared a studio, and we were always talking about how when we hit 50 we'd be doing our own thing. ... He didn't make it, and I was 57 and still pulling all-nighters. I was tired of it. I was tired of paying dues.\\" His work appears in the book Masters of Dragonlance Art.D'Ammassa, Don (January 2003). \\"Masters of Dragonlance Art\\", Chronicle 25 (1): 30. Elmore released a book of artwork called 20 Years of Elmore in 2005. He has frequently been described as a legend in the fantasy and gaming communities. In 2013, Elmore raised funding through Kickstarter for a 336-page hardback book of his artwork over his 40-year career. Personal life In 1971, before leaving for his Army service in Germany, Elmore married his wife, Betty. He has two children, and currently lives with his wife in Leitchfield, Kentucky. He attends fantasy and science fiction conventions held in the United States and Europe. He has said that inspiring others with his art has often been more rewarding than the money he earns in his profession.

The Simpsons are a nuclear family consisting of married couple Homer and Marge and their three children Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. They live at 742 Evergreen Terrace in the fictional town of Springfield, United States, and they were created by cartoonist Matt Groening, who conceived the characters after his own family members, substituting \\"Bart\\" for his own name. The family debuted on Fox on April 19, 1987 in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\" and were later spun off into their own series, which debuted on Fox in the U.S. on December 17, 1989. Alongside the five main family members, there are a number of other major and minor characters in their family. The most commonly recurring characters are Homer's father Abraham \\"Grampa\\" Simpson; Marge's sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier; and the family's two pets, Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II. Other family members include Homer's mother Mona Simpson, Homer's half-brother Herbert Powell, Marge's mother Jacqueline Bouvier, and other minor relatives. Concept and originsCreation= Groening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of James L. Brooks's office. Brooks had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts, which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series. However, when Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life's work, he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family. He named the characters after his own family members ‚Äì his father Homer, his mother Margaret, and his younger sisters Lisa and Maggie. He substituted \\"Bart\\", an anagram of \\"brat\\", for his own name, and modeled the character after his older brother, Mark.Groening, Matt. (2006). Commentary for \\"My Sister, My Sitter\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The five family members were given simple designs so that their facial emotions could easily be changed with almost no effort and so that they would be recognizable in silhouette. Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned-up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes. The Simpson family made their debut on April 19, 1987 in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\". In 1989, the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons, a half-hour series airing on the Fox Broadcasting Company. The Simpson family remained the main characters on this new show. =Casting= Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, and Yeardley Smith all began voicing their characters on The Tracey Ullman Show. Nancy Cartwright was the only one of the group who had been trained to be a voice actor while Castellaneta had done some voice over work in Chicago. Castellaneta and Kavner had been part of the regular cast of The Tracey Ullman Show and voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask them to voice Homer and Marge rather than hire more actors. The producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa. Yeardley Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Bart, but casting director Bonita Pietila believed her voice was too high. Smith later recalled, \\"I always sounded too much like a girl. I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'\\" Smith was given the role of Lisa instead. On March 13, 1987, Nancy Cartwright went in to audition for the role of Lisa. After arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the \\"middle child\\" and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart who she found more fascinating because he was described as \\"devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [and] clever.\\"Cartwright, pp. 35‚Äì40 Matt Groening let her try out for the part instead, and upon hearing her read, gave her the job on the spot. The Simpson family The Simpsons are a family who live in at 742 Evergreen Terrace in the town of Springfield in the United States. The state in which in this town is located is never specified, however they do have snow and sometimes wear sweaters in the fall. It's a running joke in the show to be as vague and ambiguous as possible whenever hinting at which U.S. state the town of Springfield might be located in. Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge Simpson, a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, an eight-year-old child prodigy; and Maggie, a 1-year-old baby who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier. The family owns a dog, Santa's Little Helper, and a cat, Snowball II. Both pets have had starring roles in several seasons. Despite the passing of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays, the Simpsons do not physically age and still appear just as they did at the end of the 1980s. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another. =Homer Simpson= Homer Jay Simpson (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) is the protagonist of the show and the father of the Simpson family. He embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, clumsy, thoughtless and a borderline alcoholic. He has occasionally displayed flashes of great intellect and fitness whenever the situation calls for it, and an integrity reflecting his own values, including a fierce devotion to and protectiveness of his family. His voice started out as an impression of Walter Matthau but eventually evolved into a more robust voice during the second and third season of the half-hour show, allowing Homer to cover a fuller range of emotions. Homer has since become one of the most influential fictional characters and has been described by the UK newspaper The Sunday Times as the greatest comedic creation of modern time. He has inspired an entire line of merchandise, and his catchphrase, the annoyed grunt \\"D'oh!\\", has been included in the Oxford English Dictionary. During the production of the episode Insane Clown Poppy the writers toyed with the idea of giving Homer a long lost legitimate biological daughter, but when the shows showrunner and writer Mike Scully, as well as Matt Groening rejected the idea, the writers changed the story so the clown Krusty would be the one who finds he has a lost daughter. =Marge Simpson= Marjorie Jacqueline \\"Marge\\" Simpson (n√©e Bouvier, voiced by Julie Kavner) is the well-meaning and extremely patient wife of Homer and mother of Bart, Lisa and Maggie. She often acts as the voice of reason, but displays exaggerated behavior traits of stereotypical mothers and takes the blatant dysfunctionality of her family for granted, unlike the other family members, who are aware that they are eccentric. Her most notable physical feature is her blue hair, styled into an improbably high beehive. Julie Kavner received a Primetime Emmy Award in 1992 for voicing Marge in the episode \\"I Married Marge\\". For her performance in The Simpsons Movie, Kavner received a nomination for \\"Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature\\" at the 2007 Annie Awards, but lost to Ian Holm in Ratatouille. Kavner's emotional performance in the movie got positive reviews and one critic said she \\"gave what must be the most heartfelt performance ever\\". Part of Kavner's contract says that she will never have to promote The Simpsons on video because she does not want to \\"destroy the illusion for children\\". In 2008, CityNews published an article entitled \\"Top 10 Greatest TV Moms of All Time\\", and placed Marge in eighth spot. =Bart Simpson= Bartholomew JoJo \\"Bart\\" Simpson (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) is the eldest child and only son in the family‚Äîat age 10. Bart's most prominent character traits are his mischievousness, rebelliousness, disrespect for authority and sharp wit. During the first two seasons of The Simpsons, Bart was the show's main character. The name \\"Bart\\" is an anagram of the word \\"brat\\". Groening conceived Bart as an extreme version of the typical misbehaving child character, merging all of the extreme traits of characters such as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn into one person. Groening's older brother Mark provided most of the inspiration for Bart. Bart's catchphrase \\"Eat My Shorts\\" was an ad-lib by Cartwright in one of the original table readings, harking back to an incident when she was at college. In 1998, Time magazine selected Bart as 46th of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century, and the only fictional character to make the list. He had previously appeared on the cover of the December 31, 1990 edition. Bart is rebellious and frequently escapes without punishment, which led some parents' groups and conservative spokespeople to believe he provided a poor role model for children. This prompted George H. W. Bush to rally, \\"We're going to keep trying to strengthen the American family. To make them more like the Waltons and less like the Simpsons.\\" Bart, and other Simpsons characters, have appeared in numerous television commercials for Nestl√©'s Butterfinger candy bars from 1990 to 2001, with the slogan \\"Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger!\\" =Lisa Simpson= Lisa Marie Simpson (voiced by Yeardley Smith) is the eldest daughter and middle child of the family. She is an extremely intelligent 8-year-old girl, one of the most intelligent characters on the show. Lisa's political convictions are generally socially liberal. She is a vegetarian, and a supporter of the Free Tibet movement,Lisa yells \\"Free Tibet!\\" after winning the school spelling bee. and while still supportive of the Christian church in which she was raised,Episode DAB-F02 Lisa became a practicing Buddhist following her decision to follow the Noble Eightfold Path. She is musically proficient on the saxophone; besides the occasional riff during the opening credit sequence Carole King's Jazzman and Gerry Rafferty's Baker Street have been prominently placed during episodes. In the Tracey Ullman Show shorts, Lisa was more of a \\"female Bart\\" and was equally mischievous. As the series progressed, Lisa began to develop into a more intelligent and more emotional character with \\"Krusty Gets Busted\\" being one of the first episodes where her true intelligence is fully shown. When she was a baby, Bart started out not liking her, although he became nicer to her after Marge pointed out that Lisa loves him. Her first word was \\"Bart\\", with Bart happily teaching her more names. Many episodes focusing on Lisa have an emotional nature, the first one being \\"Moaning Lisa\\". The idea for the episode was pitched by James L. Brooks, who had wanted to do an emotional episode where Lisa is sad because the show had done a lot of \\"jokey episodes\\". In 2001 Lisa received a special \\"board of directors Ongoing Commitment Award\\" at the Environmental Media Awards. \\"Lisa the Vegetarian\\", an episode from the seventh season, won both an Environmental Media Award for \\"Best Television Episodic Comedy\\" and a Genesis Award for \\"Best Television Comedy Series, Ongoing Commitment\\". In Japan, the broadcasters of the series found they were able to turn the apparent viewer dislike of the series around by focusing marketing attention on Lisa. Lisa's well-intended but ill-fated struggles to be a voice of reason and a force of good in her family and city struck a chord with the Japanese. =Maggie Simpson= Margaret \\"Maggie\\" Simpson is the youngest of the five main family members and is almost always seen as a baby. She has blonde spiked hair like Lisa. Her first word was \\"daddy\\", shown at one point after Homer tucks her in. She is almost 2 years old and still uses a pacifier despite teething, although this was mentioned in a Treehouse of Horror episode (\\"Starship Poopers\\") and is not considered canon. She was quite prominent in the Tracey Ullman Show shorts, often being featured alongside Bart and Lisa but has since become the least seen and heard of the five main Simpsons. It has been revealed that Maggie has outstanding artistic and academic abilities, much like her sister Lisa. The episodes taking place in the future often show her as some kind of businesswoman.Face to Face: Maggie Simpson Entertainment Weekly. Published September 11, 1992. Retrieved March 27, 2007 Maggie rarely speaks, but has been voiced by several different actors including Jodie Foster, Elizabeth Taylor, James Earl Jones, Harry Shearer (who used his Kang voice) in \\"Starship Poopers\\",Gimple, pp. 50‚Äì51 Yeardley Smith, and Nancy Cartwright. =Abe Simpson= Abraham Jebediah \\"Abe\\" Simpson II (better known simply as Grampa, voiced by Dan Castellaneta) is the patriarch of the Simpson family and the father of Homer. He is a World War II veteran who was later sent to the Springfield Retirement Castle by Homer. He is known for his borderline senility, his long rambling (and probably apocryphal) stories and his love of Matlock. He shares his name with one of Matt Groening's relatives, in this case his grandfather. However, Groening says he refused to name him, leaving it to other writers to choose a name. By coincidence, the writers chose the name Abraham. =Mona Simpson= Mona Penelope Simpson (n√©e Olsen, voiced by Glenn Close) is Homer's deceased long- lost mother and Abe's estranged first wife. Her first major appearance was in \\"Mother Simpson\\" where she reveals that she was forced to abandon her family after being caught up in the hippie movement and participated in various acts of activism. The writers used this episode as an opportunity to solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. Prior to the seventh season, Mona Simpson had only made two brief flashback appearances, the first being season two's \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" and the second being season six's \\"Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy\\" and in both episodes she was voiced by Maggie Roswell. Mona dies in the episode \\"Mona Leaves-a\\", as Homer struggles to come to terms with her death. The character is named after writer Richard Appel's wife, whose maiden name is Mona Simpson. Mona was designed in a way so that she has little bit of Homer in her face, such as the shape of her upper lip and her nose. There were several design changes because the directors were trying to make her an attractive older and younger woman, but still be Simpson-esque. Glenn Close recorded original material for another episode, season fifteen's \\"My Mother the Carjacker\\". Mona also has a speaking appearance in season ten's \\"D'oh-in in the Wind\\", this time voiced by Tress MacNeille.Gimple, pp. 86‚Äì87 =Extended Simpson family= * Herbert \\"Herb\\" Powell (voiced by Danny DeVito) ‚Äì Herb is Homer's paternal half-brother, Marge's half-brother-in-law and Bart, Lisa and Maggie's paternal half-uncle. He resembles Homer, though he is much thinner, boasts a full head of hair and is more astute. He first appeared in the season two episode \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" when Homer discovered he had a half-brother, the product of a short-lived affair between his father Abe and a carnival dunk-tank worker who was also a prostitute (identified in The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album as \\"Gaby\\"). A year after putting the baby up for adoption, Abe married Mona, who insisted he promise never to tell Homer about Herb or how he was conceived. Herb was raised by his adoptive parents Edward and Mililani Powell (first names given in the episode The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album), put himself through college by working odd jobs, then founded Powell Motors, a car company based in Detroit. Herb is an exception to \\"the Simpson gene\\", which causes all male members of the Simpson family to gradually lose their intelligence as they mature, as Herb is intelligent, successful and an astute businessman, becoming extremely wealthy due to his car dealership. Overjoyed to learn that he had a blood family, Herb bonded with the children and hired Homer, as a representative of average Americans, to design a car. The car was a flop, bankrupting the company, and Herb angrily rejects Homer as a brother and became a street vagrant. The episode was written by Jeff Martin but the idea of having Herb voiced by Danny DeVito had been pitched by Sam Simon. Some were upset with the sad ending of the episode, and as a result the producers decided to make a sequel. Herb re-appeared the next season in \\"Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?\\". Now broke and homeless, he briefly settled in the Simpson household, despite his intense continuing antipathy toward Homer. Homer loaned Herb $2000, which Herb used to build an invention that translated infantile speech into comprehensible English, based on observations he made of Maggie. He proceeded to mass-produce his new product and regained his fortune. In gratitude, he bought gifts for each member of the family and paid Homer back with his forgiveness. Homer's \\"seldom seen half-brother\\" has had only one brief speaking part since this episode: DeVito reprised his role for the Season 24 episode \\"The Changing of the Guardian\\", in which Powell's answering machine message, \\"Hi, you've reached Herb Powell. I'm poor again.\\", is heard. * Abbie ‚Äì Abbie is hinted to be Abe's illegitimate daughter and Homer's half sister from a relationship he had with a British woman named Edwina during World War II. * Chet (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) ‚Äì Chet owns an unsuccessful shrimp company. * Dr. Simpson (voiced by Tress MacNeille) ‚Äì Dr. Simpson is the chief of complicated surgeries at the invasive care unit; she is first seen in \\"Lisa the Simpson\\". She is the one who reassures Lisa that she will not suffer the defective Simpson Gene because of her sex and also reveals that only male members are affected by it. Dr. Simpson resembles Lisa, minus the spikes. * Stanley (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) ‚Äì Stanley is the Simpson children's second cousin who shoots birds at the airport. * Uncle Tyrone (voiced by Hank Azaria) ‚Äì Uncle Tyrone is a cynical elderly Simpson relative who lives in Dayton, Ohio. The family intends to visit him during his birthday in the episode \\"Catch 'Em If You Can\\". * Great-Aunt Hortense ‚Äì Great-Aunt Hortense died before \\"Bart the Fink\\" and left Homer, Marge, Bart and Lisa $100 each. The rest of her estate was passed to Ann Landers. In a continuity error, Great-Aunt Hortense appeared on Bart's journey to Heaven in \\"Bart Gets Hit by a Car\\". * A group of unnamed relatives show up in the episode \\"Lisa the Simpson\\", when Homer tries to prove to Lisa that not all Simpsons are failures. In the end, only Dr. Simpson and three other female members proved successful. * Hugo Simpson ‚Äì Hugo is Bart's conjoined twin from the \\"Treehouse of Horror VII\\" segment \\"The Thing and I\\". He and Bart were separated as babies by Dr. Hibbert and was deemed \\"evil\\". To hide the secret, Marge and Homer chained Hugo in the attic and fed him fish heads once a week. Later, Bart goes up to the attic and Hugo escapes, wanting to sew him and Bart back together. Dr. Hibbert managed to catch Hugo, but notices that the surgical scar is on the wrong side, meaning Bart is the evil twin. As a result, Hugo is released while Bart is chained in the attic. Hugo resembles Bart, but with ratty clothes, messy hair, and malformed teeth. Since he is a Treehouse of Horror character, he does not exist in the main episode continuity. * Mabel Simpson (voiced by Julie Kavner) ‚Äì Mabel is an ancestor of the Simpson family who was part of the Underground Railroad. She was married to Hiram before divorcing him and fleeing to Canada to marry Virgil. She kept the Simpson surname. ** Ex-husband: Hiram Simpson (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) ‚Äì Hiram is a distant relative of the Simpson family who was bribed with a new pair of shoes into revealing Virgil's whereabouts. He is the parent of Eliza Simpson. * Virgil (voiced by Wren T. Brown) ‚Äì Virgil, later Virgil Simpson, is an enslaved African American owned by Mr. Burns' father, Colonel Burns, and rescued by Eliza. He was betrayed by Hiram but escaped with Mabel, whom he later married, from whom the Simpson family are really descended. * Eliza Simpson (voiced by Yeardley Smith) ‚Äì Eliza Simpson is a distant relative of the Simpson family and daughter of Mabel and Hiram. She was part of the Underground Railroad with her mother and initially helped Virgil evade capture before giving him up to Wainwright Burns. In later life, she is revealed to have married Milford Van Houten, being the direct ancestor of the Van Houten family. * Abraham Simpson ‚Äì The son of Mabel and Virgil, half-brother of Eliza, and great-grandfather of Grampa Simpson. * Grampa's parents ‚Äì Grampa's parents both appear briefly in \\"Much Apu About Nothing\\" when Grampa tells the story of how his family emigrated to America. Their names were given to be Orville J. Simpson and Yuma Hickman in The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album, but have not been mentioned in the series. In the Season 25 episode \\"The Winter of His Content\\", Homer reveals that Abe's father is alive, but Abe ignores him. * Cyrus (voiced by Hank Azaria) - Cyrus is Grampa's older brother who is seen in \\"Simpsons Christmas Stories\\". Cyrus crashed his Corsair at Tahiti in World War II's Pacific Theater of Operations during a kamikaze raid. He never left and has 15 wives. * Rita LaFleur (voiced by Anika Noni Rose) ‚Äì Rita is the second wife of Abraham Simpson and a jazz recording artist. She was a singer at Spiro's Restaurant and met Abe when he was a waiter. They married and LaFleur left the restaurant, wishing to become a successful singer. She was invited to tour in Europe, but Homer suffered a head injury and Abraham realized that Homer was defenseless and would not survive in Europe, so he stayed behind with him while Rita went to Europe, and the two never saw each other again. It was revealed that she later became a heroin addict which ended up ruining her singing career. In \\"Gone Abie Gone\\", Rita reunited with Abraham and they played piano. It was unknown why they were not together. * Amber Simpson (voiced by Pamela Hayden) ‚Äì Amber was the Vegas ex-wife of both Homer and Abe Simpson from the season ten episode \\"Viva Ned Flanders\\". Homer and Ned Flanders visit Las Vegas for the weekend, get drunk and unknowingly marry two women. Amber reappears in \\"Brawl in the Family\\", where the Simpson family trick her into marrying Grampa, and in the process forsake all other spouses. Amber is horrified at the deception and runs away back to Vegas, much to Grampa's disappointment at losing another wife. In \\"Jazzy and the Pussycats\\", the Simpsons attend Homer's ex-wife and former stepmother's funeral after Amber dies from a drug overdose. * Bill Simpson is one Abe's brothers, and is apparently a communist. He is mentioned in Million-Dollar Abie as a member of the Communist Party, along with Joseph Stalin and many others. It is unknown how old Bill is, or if he is still alive. The Bouvier familyPatty and Selma Bouvier= Patty and Selma Bouvier (both voiced by Julie Kavner) are Marge's older twin sisters. They are apparently in their mid-to-late 40s, since Selma has gone through menopause and they were shown as teenagers in flashbacks while Marge was still a small child. They work at the Springfield Department of Motor Vehicles, and possess a strong dislike for their brother- in-law, Homer. Selma is the elder by two minutes, possesses a strong desire for family, and has been married and divorced six times, and also sought to have a child on numerous occasions despite her age. Her sister, Patty, is one of the show's few openly gay (or bisexual, as she once commented \\"there go the last remaining threads of my heterosexuality\\") recurring characters although for the most part she has avoided relationships. Kavner voices them as characters \\"who suck the life out of everything\\".Rhodes, Joe. \\"Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves\\" , TV Guide October 21, 2000, via The Simpsons Archive: \\"[Matt] Groening says: 'My original idea about Marge's family was they were utterly joyless. The original note I gave to Julie was that they suck the life out of everything they see'\\". Kavner makes Patty's voice more masculine and a lower register, while Selma's voice is a little sweeter. The origins of their names are unknown ‚Äì Matt Groening has a sister named Patty, but unlike the other Simpson relatives, this has not been explicitly revealed. =Jacqueline Bouvier= Jacqueline Ingrid Bouvier (n√©e Gurney, voiced by Julie Kavner) is the mother of Marge, Patty and Selma and the widow of Clancy Bouvier. She was first referenced in a flashback in the episode \\"Moaning Lisa\\" and made her first appearance in the episode \\"Bart vs. Thanksgiving\\".Brooks, James L.; Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike; Silverman, David. (2002) Commentary for \\"Bart vs. Thanksgiving\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. She had a spinster sister named Gladys, who is deceased; Jacqueline and her family attended her funeral in \\"Selma's Choice\\". Mr. Burns and Homer's father Abe Simpson once battled for her affections; she became engaged to Burns, but eventually decided not to marry either man, although she and Abe still ran away together at the end of the episode. Although it seems that she disapproves of Marge's marriage to Homer, stating that he is never to address her as \\"Mom\\", she does tolerate Homer much more than her elder daughters, Patty and Selma. In \\"Moe Letter Blues\\", she admits that Patty and Selma are really to blame for ruining her birthday party, not Homer. Jacqueline has celebrated her 80th birthday twice, in \\"Moe Letter Blues\\" and again in \\"Puffless\\". Like all Bouvier women, she is voiced by Kavner, and has large, unique hair, resembling Marge's, only a light gray color due to her old age. In her younger days she smoked heavily but has quit, although she still speaks more raspily than Patty and Selma. The series creator Matt Groening named the character after the former American First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, whose maiden name was Jacqueline Lee Bouvier. Out of all the characters on the show, Jacqueline has the tallest hair. =Clancy Bouvier= Clarence \\"Clancy\\" Bouvier (voiced by Harry Shearer) is the deceased father of Marge, Patty and Selma and the husband of Jacqueline Bouvier. His first appearance was in the episode \\"The Way We Was\\". He was kind and complimentary to teenage Homer when he arrived to pick up Marge for the prom, but after finding out that Artie Ziff was really her date remarked that Homer \\"took years off my life\\". This provoked Marge to go back and go out with Homer. In \\"Fear of Flying\\" it was revealed that he was one of the earliest male flight attendants; Marge initially believed he was a heroic pilot and was traumatized when she discovered he was a flight attendant instead. According to Marge in \\"Bart the Lover\\" after Clancy got out of the Navy, he had trouble with his cursing that nearly cost him a job as a baby photographer, but Jacqueline was able to curtail that by having him donate money to the swear jar. In the episode \\"Puffless\\", it is revealed that he died of lung cancer, which provoked Patty and Selma to abstain from smoking cigarettes. While Clancy does not appear with the rest of the Bouvier family in \\"I Married Marge\\", implying he was deceased before Homer and Marge were married, he is shown to be still alive when Bart and Lisa were toddlers in the episode \\"Walking Big & Tall\\", but he died before Maggie was born. Marge was particularly upset by her father's death, as Homer had to buy her a white noise machine to try and get her to deal with it. Like all the Bouvier family, his voice has become croaky through chain-smoking for a number of years. He also shares the same grunt as Patty and Selma, both of whom resemble younger female versions of him, while Marge more resembles her mother. In \\"Treehouse of Horror III\\", he was eaten at King Homer and Marge's wedding by the former. He also appeared as a ghost in \\"Treehouse of Horror XXVI\\". =Ling Bouvier= Ling Bouvier (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) is Selma Bouvier's adopted daughter. She shares Selma's laugh. In \\"Goo Goo Gai Pan\\", Selma discovers that she has reached menopause and adopts Ling in China, after lying that she is married to Homer, to fool the Chinese authorities into thinking that Ling would be part of a traditional family as opposed to being raised by a single mother. The authorities briefly reclaim Ling, but the adoption agent Ms. Woo relates to her experiences of her childhood with her single mother and allows Selma to adopt Ling. Ling has since become a recurring character and has appeared in several episodes. She seems to get along well with her cousin Maggie. Since Patty told Selma to give up smoking once the baby came home, Selma claimed she would switch to chewing tobacco, although it is not clear if she has followed through with this. =Meaux and Genevieve Bouvier= Marge's atheist grandmother Genevieve Bouvier lived in Nazi-occupied France in 1944 during World War II, in Vichy, France. She is discussed in \\"My Way or the Highway to Heaven\\" (third episode of the thirtieth season). Genevieve co-managed Cafe Meaux with the caf√©'s namesake, her husband Meaux, a Nazi-collaborator, and self-described treasoner. They team up to stop Nazi officers from revealing the impending D-day invasion is to happen in Normandy. =Selma's husbands= Selma has married six times, resulting in the lengthy last name Bouvier-Terwilliger- Hutz-McClure-Stu-Simpson-D'Amico. * \\"Sideshow Bob\\" Terwilliger (voiced by Kelsey Grammer) ‚Äì Sideshow Bob meets Selma via a prison pen pal program in the season three episode \\"Black Widower\\". After he is released and marries the very smitten Selma, Sideshow Bob fools everyone except for Bart, who eventually foils Sideshow Bob's plot to murder Selma on their honeymoon. * Lionel Hutz (voiced by Phil Hartman) ‚Äì Lionel Hutz is mentioned as Selma's ex- husband in the season four episode \\"Selma's Choice\\". However, this is the extent to which their relationship is depicted at any point in the series. * Troy McClure (voiced by Phil Hartman) Troy marries Selma in the season seven episode \\"A Fish Called Selma\\". It is a sham marriage devised to revitalize his career and image. When he tells her this, Selma is devastated to have been used by yet another terrible husband. For a while, she attempts to go along with the ruse, if only for the creature comforts she can access. When Troy says they need to have a child to divert public attention from rumors of his fetish involving aquarium fish, Selma knows this is a line she will not cross, and they divorce. * Disco Stu (voiced by Hank Azaria) ‚Äì Disco Stu is referenced as Selma's ex-husband in the season sixteen episode \\"There's Something About Marrying\\". Despite his last name actually being \\"Discoth√®que\\", the name \\"Stu\\" was attached to Selma's last name upon marrying him. * Grampa Simpson (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) ‚Äì Grampa Simpson married Selma in the season eighteen episode \\"Rome-Old and Juli-Eh\\"; he previously had dated her mother, Jacqueline. * \\"Fat Tony\\" D'Amico (voiced by Joe Mantegna) ‚Äì Fat Tony became Selma's sixth and most recent husband in the season twenty-two episode \\"The Real Housewives of Fat Tony\\". The two divorced when Selma discovered that Fat Tony was already married. =Extended Bouvier family= * Gladys Gurney (voiced by Julie Kavner) ‚Äì Gladys is Marge's spinster aunt and the sister of Jacqueline. Her death was noted in the episode \\"Selma's Choice\\", in which she died of a bowel obstruction. Her final words to Patty and Selma during a video will is a plea that they not end their lives old and alone like herself, prompting Selma to become more intent on having a family. * Great-Uncle Hubert ‚Äì Great Uncle Hubert is Bart, Lisa, and Maggie's great uncle who died in the short \\"The Funeral\\". It is unknown which side of the family he came from or how he died. He is only mentioned once. At the funeral, Bart views his great uncle's corpse, which makes Bart turn green and faint. Later, Bart is seen running away up a hill with Lisa and Maggie, resulting in Homer and Marge scolding them in the car. * Dot ‚Äì Dot is the cousin of Marge, Patty and Selma. She gave Selma a video camera at her wedding to Sideshow Bob. This is the only time she is mentioned. * Lou Gurney ‚Äì Lou is the uncle of Marge Simpson, Patty Bouvier and Selma Bouvier. In \\"Children of a Lesser Clod\\", Marge is called to identify Lou's body, which turns out to be a very much alive Hans Moleman. While Marge is identifying the body, Homer starts a daycare center for local children. * Uncle Arthur ‚Äì Uncle Arthur is the uncle of Bart, Lisa and Maggie, mentioned by Marge in \\"The Boy Who Knew Too Much\\". According to Marge, Arthur suffered from auditory hallucinations and went on a homicidal spree before 75 federal marshals brought him down. Otherwise, he is never mentioned and has never made an appearance. PetsDogs= * Santa's Little Helper (voiced by Frank WelkerMcCann, pp. 117‚Äì118 and Dan Castellaneta) ‚Äì Santa's Little Helper is the Simpsons' pet greyhound. He first appeared in \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\" as a race dog adopted by Homer and Bart and has been in the series since. While usually well-behaved, he can be vicious at times, having a female dog giving birth to puppies which angers Bart at first, although Bart loves and cares for him deeply. :* Country Cousins' Dog ‚Äì The Country Cousins' Dog in the episode \\"The Bonfire of the Manatees\\" is the brother of Santa's Little Helper. Though the \\"country folks\\" are not themselves blood relatives to the Simpsons, they are referred to as \\"cousins\\" in the episode because of the dogs' relation. * Laddie ‚Äì Laddie was a collie owned by the Simpson family in the episode \\"The Canine Mutiny\\". He joined the family after Bart managed to get a credit card issued to Santos L. Halper (a non-existent person whose name is a corruption of \\"Santa's Little Helper\\") and purchased him from a catalogue. Described in the catalogue as the ultimate dog, Laddie was able to perform household chores and use the toilet. Laddie resides with the Springfield Police Department after he incidentally sniffed out marijuana at a blind man's house and Bart gave up ownership. =Cats= * Snowball ‚Äì Snowball (also known as Snowball I) was the Simpson family's first cat. She was first mentioned in the series premiere in a Christmas letter Marge is writing where she explains that Snowball died that year and went to \\"kitty heaven\\". Snowball was named due to her white fur. Snowball was, according to Lisa in a poem, run over by a Chrysler belonging to Mayor Quimby's brother \\"Clovis\\". She is seen during Bart's escalator ride to Heaven in the second-season episode \\"Bart Gets Hit by a Car\\" and in flashback in the ninth-season episode \\"Lisa's Sax\\". Bart unsuccessfully tries to revive her in \\"Dial Z for Zombies\\". * Snowball II ‚Äì Snowball II was the Simpson family's second cat. Although Snowball I had white fur, which inspired her name, Snowball II had black fur. She first appeared in the series premiere but has received little attention in the series. Snowball II and Santa's Little Helper have always been shown as having a good relationship; usually they are seen sleeping near each other. Snowball II's largest role is in the fourteenth season episode \\"Old Yeller Belly\\", in which she saves Homer from a burning treehouse. She also has minor roles in \\"Bart Gets an Elephant\\", where she tries to get attention; in \\"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds\\", in which she is scared by the many puppies; and in \\"Make Room for Lisa\\", in which Lisa has a hallucination where she becomes Snowball II. :* In the episode \\"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot\\", Snowball II is killed and is replaced in series by Snowball III and then Coltrane, both of which also die quickly. A final replacement, Snowball V is essentially identical to Snowball II and proves to be less unlucky. Lisa renames this cat Snowball II and the events of this episode are never referred to again. This cat is the focus of a subplot in the sixteenth season episode \\"The Seven-Beer Snitch\\", in which she becomes overweight after abandoning the Simpsons for brief periods to visit a different family but she then goes back to live with the Simpson family. =Other pets= * Plopper ‚Äì Plopper, formerly known as Harry Plopper and Spider Pig, is Homer's pet pig. * Mojo ‚Äì Mojo was the helper monkey Homer had in the episode \\"Girly Edition\\". Mojo, an intelligent and highly trained service animal when Homer adopted him, quickly adapted to match Homer's lazy and unhealthy lifestyle. When Mojo's condition severely worsens, Homer, fearing the repercussions of potentially having the monkey die under his watch, drops him off at the adoption center. * Chirpy Boy and Bart Junior ‚Äì Chirpy Boy and Bart Junior were Bart's pet lizards. * Stampy ‚Äì Stampy was an African elephant briefly owned by the Simpson family in the episode \\"Bart Gets an Elephant\\". * Strangles ‚Äì Strangles was a green tree python that Bart owned during the episode \\"Stop or My Dog Will Shoot\\", during which time Santa's Little Helper was a police dog. Strangles' current owner is Groundskeeper Willie. Bart named the snake Strangles while it was strangling Homer on the dinner table. * Pokey ‚Äì Pokey was a guinea pig and Lisa's first pet of her own. It appears in \\"The Simpsons: Tapped Out\\" and in the episode \\"The War of Art\\" where it destroyed the iconic artwork over the lounge. * Princess ‚Äì Princess was Lisa's pony from the episode \\"Lisa's Pony\\". Homer bought Lisa a pony to show her that he loves her, but he has to work two jobs to keep her. When Lisa discovers this she gives up Princess. * Pinchy ‚Äì Pinchy was Homer's pet lobster in \\"Lisa Gets an \\"A\\"\\". Homer went to the supermarket to buy a lobster that he could cook for dinner. Homer found that the big lobsters were too expensive, so he bought a smaller lobster with the intention of fattening him up, but he grew attached to the lobster and decided to keep him as a pet instead, naming him Pinchy. At the end of the episode, Homer puts Pinchy in a hot bath, but accidentally boils and kills him. Since his body is cooked, a sobbing Homer eats Pinchy's remains, saying that \\"That's what he would want\\".

The story's title refers to the symbol for Castel's emotional and physical isolation from society, which becomes increasingly apparent as Castel proceeds to tell from his jail cell the series of events that enabled him to murder the only person capable of understanding him. Marked by its existential themes, El T√∫nel received enthusiastic support from Albert Camus and Graham Greene following its publication in 1948. Plot summary The story begins with the main character introducing himself as \\"the painter who killed Mar√≠a Iribarne\\" before delving into the circumstances that led to their first encounter. Castel's obsession begins in the autumn of 1946 when at an exhibition of his work he notices a woman focusing on one particularly subtle detail of his painting \\"Maternidad\\" (\\"Maternity\\"). He considers this observation deeply significant since it is a detail that he values as the most important aspect of the painting but to which nobody besides him and the woman pay any attention. Missing out on an opportunity to approach her before she leaves the exhibition, he then spends the next few months obsessing over her, thinking of ways to find her in the immensity of Buenos Aires, and fantasizing about what to say to her. Ultimately, after seeing her entering a building which he presumes to be her place of employment, he considers how to go about asking her about the detail in the painting. He approaches her and learns that her name is Mar√≠a Iribarne. Following their discussion about the painting, Castel and Mar√≠a agree to see each other again. It later becomes clear that she is married to a blind man named Allende and lives on Posadas Street in the northern part of the city. As Castel continues to see Mar√≠a, however, their relationship comes to be dominated by his obsessive interrogations of her life with her husband, why she does not take her husband's last name, and of her inner thoughts, questions she is unable to answer to his satisfaction. Out of this disconnect, Castel's obsessive thoughts lead him to all sorts of irrational doubts about the love he has come to believe that they have for one another. This anxiety intensifies after he and Maria make a trip to an estancia, a country ranch in Mar del Plata owned by Allende's cousin Hunter. The atmosphere, the presence and attitudes of the other visiting relatives, and realizing Hunter's jealousy all feed into Castel's paranoia, forcing him to flee the ranch with little more than a word to one of the service staff. While waiting at a station to leave the region, Castel expects Mar√≠a to figure out he has left and to come stop him. She never arrives, confirming his negative feelings. Upon returning home to Buenos Aires, Castel passionately composes a hurtful letter, accusing her of sleeping with Hunter, which he immediately regrets upon mailing to her. He angrily but unsuccessfully attempts to convince a postal worker to retract the certified letter and later concludes that fate has decided it should reach its destination. Later, Castel reaches Mar√≠a by phone: she reluctantly agrees to meet with him again, although she tells him that it will likely do them little good and, in fact, probably cause him more harm. When she does not arrive in Buenos Aires, he decides that Mar√≠a is, in fact, a prostitute who cheats on her husband not only with him, but also with Hunter and other men. In a fit of rage, he drives out to the estancia. There he waits hidden outside for guests to leave the large house. Meanwhile his anxiety grows to the point where he envisions himself and Mar√≠a passing each other through life in parallel passageways or tunnels, whereas he is \\"a single tunnel, dark and solitary: mine, the tunnel wherein passed all my infancy, my youth, my entire life.\\" Eventually, Castel enters the house, approaches Mar√≠a in her room, where he accuses her of leaving him alone in the world, and stabs her to death. Following the attack, Castel shows up to Allende's office to tell him that he has murdered Mar√≠a for sleeping with Hunter, only to discover that Allende is well aware of his cuckold status. Crying out again and again that Castel is a fool, Allende sadly, and ineffectually, tries to fight Castel, who leaves and later turns himself in to the police.

There are similarities in the use of kava between the different cultures and islands, but each one also has its own traditions. Fiji In Fiji, kava (also called \\"grog\\" or \\"yaqona\\") is drunk at all times of day in both public and private settings. The consumption of the drink is a form of welcome and figures in important socio-political events. Both genders drink kava. Futuna On Futuna kava drinking is used to install a new chief. Hawaii In Hawaii, at least 13 varieties of (kava) have been used for medicinal, religious, political, cultural and social purposes by all social classes, and by both men and women. Although there are 13 distinct cultivars from Hawaii there are a number of other cultivars found throughout the islands bought in from other locations in Oceania. Rotuma In Rotuma, kava has two contexts, ceremonial and informal. The kava ceremony, when it functions as part of any ceremonial event, is a highly political affair, with individuals served according to rank. In pre-European times, the kava was chewed by virgin girls, (marked by caked limestone on their hair), before it was mixed with the water to make the drink. Samoa In Samoa, kava (called 'ava) is drunk at all important gatherings and ceremonies. The kava is prepared by a group of people called aumaga. It is brought to each participant by the tautua'ava, or 'ava server, in the order prescribed by the tufa'ava, or 'ava distributor. Usually, the highest chief of the visiting party is served first, followed by the highest chief of the host party, and then service proceeds based on the rank of the rest of the participants. The drink is served in a polished coconut half. The overall ceremony is highly ritualized, with specific gestures and phrases to be used at various times. Tonga A typical informal faikava in Tonga with the toua serving the men. In Tonga, kava is like alcohol and drunk nightly at kalapu (Tongan for \\"club\\"), which is also called a faikava (\\"to do kava\\"). Only men are allowed to drink the kava, although women who serve it may be present. The female server is usually an unmarried, young woman called the \\"toua.\\" In the past, this was a position reserved for women being courted by an unmarried male, and much respect was shown. These days, it is imperative that the toua not be related to anyone in the kalapu, and if someone is found to be a relative of the toua, he (not the toua) will leave the club for that night; otherwise the brother-sister taboo would make it impossible to talk openly, especially about courtship. Foreign girls, especially volunteer workers from overseas are often invited to be a toua for a night. If no female toua can be found, or it is such a small, very informal gathering, one of the men will do the job of serving the kava root; this is called fakatangata (\\"all-man\\"). The kava is served in rounds. Typically the toua will first stir the kava in the kumete, then pour some in the ipu (coconut cups) which are then passed from hand to hand to those sitting farthest away. They drink, and the empty cups are returned again from hand to hand. Everybody remains seated, cross-legged, although one is allowed to stretch the legs from time to time. Meanwhile, the toua has filled other cups for those next from the farthest away, and so the drinking goes forth until those nearest to the kumete have had their drink too. Then the men talk again (about politics, sports, tradition & culture, jokes, or anything else) or they will sing a traditional love song, often accompanied by guitar. Some now- famous string bands have had their origin at a faikava. Finally, the next drinking round starts. In some of the outer islands of Tonga, kava is drunk almost every night, but on the main island of Tongatapu, it is usually drunk only on Wednesday and Saturday nights. Kava drinking frequently lasts as long as eight or nine hours. With the introduction of television, rugby is usually watched by the kava drinkers, and the songs are sung in the commercial breaks. On Saturday nights, a short pause for prayer is made at midnight as the day moves to Sunday, and then hymns replace the love songs. These hymns are mostly traditional English melodies with new words in Tongan. =Formal versions= All important occasions are also marked by a more formal ritual of drinking kava, including weddings, funerals, graduation from university, and royal occasions. A formal kava ceremony is a component of the accession rites for a King of Tonga, who must participate in the pongipongi to make his rule official. Formal kava parties follow completely different rules. A male chief is now the toua, and the kava is very solemnly prepared by pounding the roots to powder (instead of buying bags of pre-pounded kava powder). Once the kava is of the right strength, as deduced from its colour, the master of ceremonies will call out the nickname of the first recipient using an archaic formula (kava kuo heka). The toua will fill the cup and the cup is then brought, often by a young lady, to the intended chief, and brought back afterwards. Then the next name is called, and so forth. Uvea (Wallis) In Uvea (Wallis Island) during the informal kava parties, the cups are passed by young boys who are appointed to run around, bringing the cups to the next person. When they get the kava, they pass it to the next person on the side or to the person who has not had one, and the young ones go and get the water to mix with the kava. Vanuatu In Vanuatu, kava is traditionally drunk at night in a place called a nakamal. Nakamals are village club houses and in many areas are open only to men. Kava is normally drunk from an empty coconut shell. In urban areas of Vanuatu there are large numbers of kava bars, which are open to men and in some cases, women. The availability of kava is signalled by a lantern at the entrance, and many kava bars are identified by the colour of their light. In these bars, kava is generally served in plastic or glass bowls instead of coconut shells. In all these venues the emphasis is more on recreational purposes and socializing than on the spiritual or medicinal qualities of kava consumption. In northern and central Vanuatu, kava roots are traditionally ground using hand-held stone grinders, while in southern Vanuatu the traditional method of preparation involves chewing the roots, then spitting the resulting paste into a container. Current methods involve preparation in rams (in which kava is pounded in a section of pipe), meat-mincers, and mechanical grinders. After grinding the kava is mixed with water and sieved before serving. The residue from kava preparation, known as makas (a Bislama term derived from megasse \\"sugar cane residue\\"), may be re-used to prepare additional batches of the drink, although these are much weaker than the original batch. On Survivor: Vanuatu, contestant Chad Crittenden briefly fell ill after drinking a rather potent kava during a native ceremony he attended as a reward. Continental United States Kava is legal in the United States and is often served in specialty kava bars. Patrons at kava bars vary from those who use it recreationally (similar to alcohol or legal recreational marijuana in states with licensed retailers) and those who believe in its healing effects, though these have not been proven or tested by the FDA. Kava is sometimes served in the United States alongside the more controversial kratom, a leaf with effects similar to opiates when served as a tea or brew. The first kava bar in the United States, Nakava, was opened in Boca Raton, Florida in 2000.

It is operated by the St Vincent's Health service, previously known as the Sisters of Charity Health Service, Melbourne. It is situated at the corner of Nicholson Street and Victoria Street. The hospital is a tertiary referral centre which offers a variety of medical, surgical and mental health specialities. History St Vincent's Hospital was opened in 1893 as a Catholic hospital owned and operated by the Sisters of Charity. Initially conceived as a branch of the Sydney institution of the same name the hospital was intended to be a charitable institution, which was hoped would help bolster Melbourne's minimal health care. This idea was given avid support by Melbourne's Catholic Archbishop, Dr Thomas Carr, who welcomed the idea of a hospital to take care of the 'poor and sick and abandoned children... the young girls of poor parents and servants...'Rev T O'Farrell (letter) quoted in Egan, Brian Ways of a Hospital: St Vincent's in Melbourne 1890s-1990s St Leonards, Allen & Unwin, 1993. 8 These ideals corresponded directly with prevalent Victorian ideas of benevolence, which were particularly popular with the middle classes.Egan Ways of a Hospital 11 In these early days, the hospital was quite small, occupying three terrace houses in the corner of Victoria Parade and Regent Street (now occupied by the west end of the Healy Wing), with room for less than 100 beds.Croggon, Veryan 'One Ray of Sunshine: St Vincent's Hospital' in Reflections of Fitzroy Melbourne: Melbourne University Press, 2008. 34 Though located very centrally on the edge of the CBD, the suburb beyond, Fitzroy, had some of poorest areas in the city, and the site had been deliberately selected by the founding sisters of the Hospital, with many of the poorer residents taking advantage of the advent of a charitable hospital opening up on their doorstep. Over time it became a large public hospital, with close links to the Mercy Hospital, Melbourne and St Vincent's Private Hospital Melbourne. In July 2002, the Sisters of Charity Health Service, Melbourne was rebranded as St Vincent's Health. First purpose built block, 1905 The earliest building remaining on the site is a red brick arched ward block built in 1905 set behind the terraces, which was later joined by the striking stepped brickwork of a new front block, the Healy Wing, built in 1931-34, designed by Stephenson & Meldrum. These two together are now heritage listed. A private hospital section known as Mt St Evins was built in 1911 on the eastern corner of Victoria Parade and Fitzroy Street. The Druid's Wing west of the Healy Wing was opened on Sunday 11 May 1913 by Dr Mannix, the Roman Catholic coadjutor Archbishop of Melbourne. It housed the hospital's first outpatients' department and a residence for nurses in training. 300x300px The hospital greatly expanded in the 1950s with a convent behind the Healy Wing, a 10 storey nurses home on the corner of Nicholson Street, and the Daly Wing behind that. In the 1960s-70s the hospital expanded over a much larger area with the Bolte Wing on Nicholson Street, and clinical services buildings on the narrow Princes Street and Regent Streets, now within the hospital grounds. In the early 70s the private hospital wing was replaced by a larger one, and a medical suites building was built on the west corner of Fitzroy Street c1980. In the early 1990s the convent was demolished and replaced by a new high rise block, known as the Inpatient Services Building, completed in 1995. The new hospital building was widely praised for its innovative design - for example, complementary medical and surgical specialties (such as neurology/neurosurgery) exist on opposite sides of the same ward, there are decentralised nurses' stations, and satellite pharmacies on every second floor stocking locally relevant medications. In 2015 it was announced that the Druids Wing would be demolished to make way for a new Aikenhead Centre for Medical Discovery., but it was not removed until 2019. The Clinical School A clinical school was opened in St Vincent's Hospital in 1909 as part of the University of Melbourne. It is one of the clinical schools at the University of Melbourne (the others being based at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, the Austin Hospital, Western Hospital, the Northern Hospital, Epping, Goulburn Valley Health, Ballarat Base Hospital and Northeast Health). St Vincent's Hospital is also a clinical school of the University of Notre Dame, Sydney. Third and fourth year students have placements in geriatrics, anaesthetics and ICU. The hospital also offers a wide range of postgraduate training programs.  St Vincent's Pathology  St Vincent's Pathology is a major pathology service in Victoria, operated out of St Vincent's Hospital. Services offered include anatomical pathology, biochemistry, haematology, cytogenetics and microbiology.

Its design later influenced the BBN Butterfly computer. The Pluribus had its beginnings in 1972 when the need for a second-generation interface message processor (IMP) became apparent. At that time, the BBN had already installed IMPs at more than thirty-five ARPANET sites. These IMPs were Honeywell 316 and 516 minicomputers. The network was growing rapidly in several dimensions: number of nodes, hosts, and terminals; volume of traffic; and geographic coverage (including plans, now realized, for satellite extensions to Europe and Hawaii). A goal was established to design a modular machine which, at its lower end, would be smaller and less expensive than the 316's and 516's while being expandable in capacity to provide ten times the bandwidth of, and capable of servicing five times as many input- output (I/O) devices as, the 516. Related goals included greater memory addressing capability and increased reliability. The designers decided on a multiprocessor approach because of its promising potential for modularity, for cost per performance advantages, for reliability, and because the IMP packet switch algorithms were clearly suitable for parallel processing by independent processors.  Hardware  A Pluribus consisted of two or more standard 19\\" electronic equipment racks, each divided into four bays. Each bay contained a backplane bus and an independent power supply. A bay might contain a processor bus, a shared memory bus, or an I/O bus. Custom-built bus couplers connected the bays to one another so that the processors could reach the shared memory and the I/O devices. A 6-processor Pluribus was used as a network switch to interconnect BBN's five Tenex/\\"Twenex\\" timesharing systems along with 378 terminals on direct serial and dial-in modem lines. The Pluribus used the Lockheed SUE as its processor. The SUE was similar to DEC's PDP-11.  Software  The Pluribus software implemented MIMD symmetric multiprocessing. Software processes were implemented using non-preemptive multiprogramming. Process scheduling used a hardware device, called the pseudo-interrupt device or PID, that was accessible to both programs and to I/O devices. Each processor ran its own copy of the process scheduler, which would read an integer value from the PID. The value was used to select the process to run. If a program or device needed to signal another process to run, it would write that process' number into the PID. The PID would emit the highest priority process that anyone had requested, and served them out to all processors. An important aspect of the Pluribus software was the \\"STAGE\\" system, which detected system errors and took steps to recover from them. The processor clocks had interrupt handlers which implemented watchdog timers on all processors. If a processor stopped running, another processor would detect it and initiate a recovery. The recovery process would unlock any locks placed on shared resources, release allocated storage, and restart all processing on all processors. This was acceptable on an ARPANET routing node, since any lost packets would eventually be retransmitted.

The ship was the first U.S. Navy vessel named for Alexander Scammel Wadsworth. Wadsworth was laid down by the Bath Iron Works of Bath, Maine, in February 1914 and launched in April 1915. The ship was a little more than in length, nearly abeam, and displaced . She was armed with four guns and had eight 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. Wadsworths geared steam turbine power plant was a successful prototype that greatly influenced U.S. destroyer designs after 1915. After her July 1915 commissioning, Wadsworth served on the neutrality patrol off the east coast and in the Caribbean. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Wadsworth was the flagship of the first U.S. destroyer squadron sent overseas. Patrolling the Irish Sea out of Queenstown, Ireland, Wadsworth reported several encounters with U-boats in the first months overseas. She was transferred to Brest, France, in March 1918, and spent the remainder of the war there. Upon returning to the United State at the end of 1918, Wadsworth underwent a five-month overhaul. She served as a plane guard for the Navy's transatlantic flight attempt by four Navy-Curtiss flying boats in May. After two years in reduced commission in August, Wadsworth was reactivated in May 1921. She was decommissioned in June 1922, and spent nearly 14 years in reserve at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in January 1936, sold in June, and scrapped in August.  Design and construction  Wadsworth was authorized in 1913 as a part of the which, like the related , was an improved version of the s authorized in 1911. Construction of the vessel was awarded to Bath Iron Works of Bath, Maine, which laid down her keel on 23 February 1914. Fourteen months later, on 29 April 1915, Wadsworth was launched by sponsor Juanita Doane Wells. The ship was named after Commodore Alexander Scammel Wadsworth (1790‚Äì1851), a U.S. Navy officer during the War of 1812 and later the Navy's Inspector of Ordnance. As built, Wadsworth was in length and abeam and drew . The ship had a standard displacement of and displaced when fully loaded. Unlike the rest of the Tucker-class ships‚Äîwhich had differing arrangements of steam turbines and reciprocating engines for cruising‚ÄîWadsworth was designed with what became the main United States prototype installation of her two Curtis geared steam turbines. According to Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906‚Äì1921, the mechanical design for Wadsworth had a \\"considerable effect\\" on post-1915 U.S. destroyer designs. As installed, the steam turbines could generate and move the ship at speeds up to , though Wadsworth reached a top speed of during her trials. Wadsworths main battery consisted of four /50 Mark 9 guns,The 50 denotes the length of the gun barrels; in this case, the gun is 50 calibers, meaning that the gun is 50 times as long as it is in diameter, in this case. The Mark number is the version of the gun; in this case, the ninth U.S. Navy design of the 4-inch/50 gun. with each gun weighing in excess of . The guns fired armor-piercing projectiles at . At an elevation of 20¬∞, the guns had a range of . Wadsworth was also equipped with eight torpedo tubes. The General Board of the United States Navy had called for two anti-aircraft guns for the Tucker-class ships, as well as provisions for laying up to 36 floating mines. From sources, it is unclear if these recommendations were followed for Wadsworth or any of the Tucker ships.  Early career  Wadsworth during trials USS Wadsworth was commissioned into the United States Navy at the Boston Navy Yard on 23 July 1915 under the command of Lieutenant Commander Joseph K. Taussig. After trials and torpedo firing drills out of Newport, Rhode Island, the destroyer took up duty off the New England coast line in October. Her duty included patrols to insure America's neutrality vis-a-vis the year-old European war. On 7 January 1916, she departed Provincetown, Massachusetts, to join in the annual Fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean. After a stop at Norfolk, Virginia, she reached the West Indies at Culebra Island on 15 January and began a three-month round of war games, drills, and exercises. During her stay in the Caribbean, she visited Guantanamo Bay, Guacanayabo Bay, Manzanillo, and Santiago ‚Äî all in Cuba. On 10 April, she left Guantanamo Bay to steam north, stopped at New York for a five-week stay, and returned to Newport on 21 May. Wadsworth resumed operations along the New England coast, and the succeeding year passed in much the same way as had its predecessor ‚Äî summer operations along the northeastern coast followed by Fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean. At the completion of her second round of winter Fleet maneuvers in the spring of 1917, Wadsworth returned north as far as Hampton Roads. As America's entry into World War I approached, she and her sister destroyers began patrolling the Norfolk‚ÄìYorktown area to protect the naval bases and ships there against potential incursions by German submarines.  World War I  Wadsworth anchored at Queenstown, Ireland On 6 April 1917, while Wadsworth was at anchor with the rest of the Fleet at Yorktown, the United States entered World War I. Wadsworth moved to New York almost immediately to prepare for the voyage to Europe and war service. On 24 April, she departed New York for Europe, as the flagship of Commander Joseph K. Taussig, commanding Division 8, Destroyer Force, the first six-ship destroyer division dispatched to United Kingdom. She led , , , , and into Queenstown, Ireland, on 4 May and began patrolling the southern approaches to the Irish Sea the next day. Wadsworths first summer overseas proved to be the most eventful period of her wartime service. She sighted her first U-boat on 18 May, less than two weeks after she began patrols out of Queenstown. Though the destroyer sped to the attack, the submarine dove and escaped. Three days later, Wadsworth picked up some survivors from which had been torpedoed and sunk the preceding day. On 7 June, the destroyer caught a glimpse of another enemy submarine just before it submerged and escaped. Between 24 and 27 June, Wadsworth served as part of the escort for the first American troop convoy to reach Europe. Though she scored no definitely provable successes against German submarines, the destroyer made depth charge attacks on four separate occasions in July and a gunfire attack in one other instance. The first two depth-charge attacks, on 10 and 11 July, returned no results whatsoever, and the gun attack on 20 July was similarly unrewarding. However, after sighting a double periscope the following day, Wadsworth made another depth-charge attack. During that attack, one of the explosions seemed much stronger than those from the other charges she dropped. Moreover, a patch of reddish-brown material rose to the surface. Although it seemed certain that the destroyer had damaged a submarine, no conclusive evidence was found to prove this possibility. Wadsworth (second ship from the right) and other destroyers moored next to destroyer tender in Queenstown in 1917. Wadsworth made her fourth depth charge attack on a U-boat on 29 July. At about 17:25, she dropped several charges in what appeared to be the wake of a submarine proceeding submerged. The conjecture that a U-boat was damaged was supported by the appearance of a large amount of heavy oil on the surface following the attack. Just before 23:00, the warship attacked another supposed submarine wake. It was too dark to evaluate the results; but, not long thereafter, struck a submerged metallic object which caused her to list 10¬∞ temporarily. Later, Wadsworths wireless operator intercepted messages sent by a German submarine over a period of about half an hour which suggested that Wadsworth may have damaged a submarine, although as with the depth-charge attack of 21 June, no definite proof was forthcoming. Early in August, the destroyer concluded her summer of peak activity by escorting the first United States merchant convoy on the last leg of its voyage to Europe. During the mission, on the 16th, the destroyer dropped a barrage on what was thought to be a submarine. For the remainder of the war, her encounters with the enemy were infrequent. In fact, her next submarine contact did not occur until 17 December and, like those before, resulted in no definite damage to the enemy. Although the opening months of 1918 brought no new U-boat contacts, Wadsworth worked hard escorting convoys and patrolling British waters. Early in March 1918, she received a change in assignment. On the 4th, she arrived in Brest, France, whence she operated for the remainder of the war. During that assignment, she recorded only two scrapes with German submarines: the first on 1 June and the second on 25 October. In each case, she dropped depth charges, but could produce no solid proof of damage to the enemy. The war ended on 11 November 1918 when Germany accepted Allied armistice terms.  Later career  Wadsworth served as a plane guard for the 1919 transatlantic flight attempt by NC-4, a Curtiss NC flying boat. On 31 December 1918, Wadsworth stood out of Brest to return to the United States and reached Boston, Massachusetts, on 9 January 1919. Following an extended overhaul, she put to sea on 1 May to serve as one of the picket ships stationed at intervals across the ocean for the transatlantic flight of four Curtiss NC flying boats, one of which, NC-4, successfully completed the feat. The destroyer returned home and operated on the east coast through the summer of 1919. On 29 August, Wadsworth was placed in reduced commission at Philadelphia where she remained almost two years. On 9 May 1921, the destroyer returned to active service along the east coast. Just over a year later, on 3 June 1922, Wadsworth was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. The ship remained in reserve there until 7 January 1936 when her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. She was sold for scrapping on 30 June 1936 and was broken up the following August.

Of the three titles, only one was designed from the ground up as a Power Strike title. The other two are Aleste games re-branded for release outside of Japan. Power Strike Originally released in Japan in 1988 under the name Aleste, Power Strike is a slightly stripped-down version of the game released for international audiences in the same year. Power Strike contains one less level than Aleste and the anime-styled storyline was removed. In the United States, Power Strike is notable because it was the first mail-order only Sega Master System title. It was also the only title in the Power Strike series to be released in the United States. The US release was initially a mail-only limited edition, however it did see some retail distribution at Toys R' Us. The European release was a normal retail package. Power Strike II (Master System) Power Strike II, released in 1993 in Europe and Brazil for the Sega Master System only, was the only game in the series designed from the ground up as a Power Strike game. It takes place in an alternate past in the 1930s, where players try to capture aerial pirates in retro-futuristic aircraft. The title plays similar to its predecessor, but adds a charged attack by holding the fire button. Power Strike II (Game Gear) Power Strike II, released in 1993 in Europe and Brazil for the Game Gear, was originally released in Japan under the name of GG Aleste II: Lance Bird.

Pentelic marble, fragment from the frieze of the Basilica Aemilia, 1st century BC‚Äì1st century AD. The Ficus Ruminalis was a wild fig tree that had religious and mythological significance in ancient Rome. It stood near the small cave known as the Lupercal at the foot of the Palatine Hill and was the spot where according to tradition the floating makeshift cradle of Romulus and Remus landed on the banks of the Tiber. There they were nurtured by the she-wolf and discovered by Faustulus. Livy, I.4 Varro, De lingua latina 5.54; Pliny, Natural History 15.77; Plutarch, Life of Romulus 4.1; Servius, note to Aeneid 8.90; Festus 332‚Äì333 (edition of Lindsay). The tree was sacred to Rumina, one of the birth and childhood deities, who protected breastfeeding in humans and animals.Lawrence Richardson, A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 151. St. Augustine mentions a Jupiter Ruminus.Augustine, De Civitate Dei 7.11, as cited by Arthur Bernard Cook, \\"The European Sky-God, III: The Italians,\\" Folklore 16.3 (1905), p. 301. Name The wild fig tree was thought to be the male, wild counterpart of the cultivated fig, which was female. In some Roman sources, the wild fig is caprificus, literally \\"goat fig\\". The fruit of the fig tree is pendulous, and the tree exudes a milky sap if cut. Rumina and Ruminalis (\\"of Rumina\\") were connected by some Romans to rumis or ruma, \\"teat, breast,\\" but some modern linguists think it is more likely related to the names Roma and Romulus, which may be based on rumon, perhaps a word for \\"river\\" or an archaic name for the Tiber.Richardson, Topographical Dictionary, p. 151. Legend The tree is associated with the legend of Romulus and Remus, and stood where their cradle came to rest on the banks of the Tiber, after their abandonment. The tree offered the twins shade and shelter in their suckling by a she-wolf, just outside the nearby Lupercal cave, until their discovery and fostering by the shepherd Faustulus and his wife Acca Larentia. Remus was eventually killed by Romulus, who went on to found Rome on the Palatine Hill, above the cave.Livy, I.4Varro, De lingua latina 5.54; Pliny, Natural History 15.77; Plutarch, Life of Romulus 4.1; Servius, note to Aeneid 8.90; Festus 332‚Äì333 (edition of Lindsay). History A statue of the she-wolf was supposed to have stood next to the Ficus Ruminalis. In 296 BC, the curule aediles Gnaeus and Quintus Ogulnius placed images of Romulus and Remus as babies suckling under her teats.Livy 10.23.12; Dionysius of Halicarnassus 1.79.8. It may be this sculpture group that is represented on coins.Richardson, Topographical Dictionary, p. 151. The Augustan historian Livy says that the tree still stood in his day,Livy 1.4: ubi nunc ficus Ruminalis est. but his younger contemporary Ovid observes only vestigia, \\"traces,\\"Ovid, Fasti 2.411. perhaps the stump.Richardson, Topographical Dictionary, p. 151. A textually problematic passage in PlinyPliny, Natural History 15.77. seems to suggest that the tree was miraculously transplanted by the augur Attus Navius to the Comitium. This fig tree, however, was the Ficus Navia, so called for the augur. Tacitus refers to the Ficus Navia as the Arbor Ruminalis, an identification that suggests it had replaced the original Ficus Ruminalis, either symbolically after the older tree's demise, or literally, having been cultivated as an offshoot. The Ficus Navia grew from a spot that had been struck by lightning and was thus regarded as sacred.Richardson, Topographical Dictionary, p. 150. Pliny's obscure reference may be to the statue of Attus Navius in front of the Curia Hostilia:Festus 168‚Äì170 (Lindsay); Dionysius of Halicarnassus 3.71.5. he stood with his lituus raised in an attitude that connected the Ficus Navia and the accompanying representation of the she-wolf to the Ficus Ruminalis, \\"as if\\" the tree had crossed from one space to the other.Richardson, Topographical Dictionary, pp. 150‚Äì151. When the Ficus Navia drooped, it was taken as a bad omen for Rome. When it died, it was replaced.Pliny, Natural History 15.77. In 58 AD, it withered, but then revived and put forth new shoots.Tacitus, Annales 13.58. In the archaeology of the Comitium, several irregular stone-lined shafts in rows, dating from Republican phases of pavement, may have been apertures to preserve venerable trees during rebuilding programs. Pliny mentions other sacred trees in the Roman Forum, with two additional figs. One fig was removed with a great deal of ritual fuss because its roots had undermined a statue of Silvanus. A relief on the Plutei of Trajan depicts Marsyas the satyr, whose statue stood in the Comitium, next to a fig tree that is placed on a plinth, as if it too were a sculpture. It is unclear whether this representation means that sacred trees might be replaced with artificial or pictorial ones. The apertures were paved over in the time of Augustus, an event that may explain Ovid's vestigia.Rabun Taylor, \\"Roman Oscilla: An Assessment,\\" in RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics 48 (2005), pp. 91‚Äì92.

He was the 12th mayor of Calgary, Alberta. Mackie was born in Westminster, England in 1860 to Scottish parents. Hearing of opportunities in Canada, he emigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1882. In Winnipeg, he learnt to become a gunsmith with Hingston Smith Arms Company. In 1885, he went back to England to convince his parents to return with him to Canada. They instead decided to go to Syracuse, New York then later San Francisco, California. While en route back to Canada, Mackie met Grace MacMillan Forgan. Forgan was heading to Omaha, Nebraska to be with her parents. They continued to write each other, and in February, 1892 they were married. Mackie headed to Calgary in 1886 to open a gun store. Mackie had short-lived business partnerships with Walter Mackay and Joseph Cockel that helped expand his business knowledge beyond gunsmithing. He ended up being involved with taxidermy, sports goods, fishing tackle, cutlery, fur, etc. In November 1899, he purchased the Thomson Bros. bookstore. In 1901, he bought the Thompson Stationery Company. In 1891, Mackie became a charter member of the Calgary Board of Trade, which is now the Chamber of Commerce. He spent six years as an Alderman of the Calgary City Council. He also held the position of mayor for one term. Mackie also got himself into real estate. He built the Mackie Block and the Lancaster building in Calgary, which are today prominent historical structures in downtown Calgary.

It involved the significant questions of precisely when the High Court came into existence and the rules applicable to a grant of special leave to appeal. Background On 9 August 1901, Robert Hannah was injured while driving a hansom cab along Elizabeth Street in Sydney, Australia. A telephone wire that was being repaired overhead fell onto electric tram wires and then contacted the cab, resulting in Hannah's injury. The cab was also damaged, and the horse was electrocuted. Hannah brought an action for negligence in the Supreme Court of New South Wales against the Commonwealth, who were represented by a nominal defendant, the Deputy Postmaster-General of New South Wales James Dalgarno. Hannah succeeded at trial and was awarded GBP 200 in damages. Dalgarno appealed to a Full Court of the Supreme Court, but the appeal was rejected on 20 August 1903, five days before the Judiciary Act 1903 (which established the High Court) was given royal assent. On 15 October 1903 Dalgarno was granted special leave to appeal to the High Court. The case was heard in early November. Arguments The main issue in the case was whether the High Court had the jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Hannah argued that since the original judgement was given before the Judiciary Act 1903 came into force, the court could not hear the appeal. Dalgarno argued that the right of appeal was not created by the Judiciary Act, but by the Constitution of Australia, which provided that \\"the judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Supreme Court, to be called the High Court of Australia\\" (section 71). Thus, Dalgarno argued that the High Court actually came into existence on 1 January 1901, when the Constitution came into effect. Hannah also argued that even if the High Court had the appropriate jurisdiction, the nature of the case did not merit the granting of special leave to appeal. Section 73 of the Constitution provides that the High Court can hear appeals from any federal court or State supreme court subject to certain exceptions and regulations made by the Parliament. The court pointed out that acts of Parliament could therefore only modify the exercise of rights to appeal (in terms of procedures and costs, for example), and not create new rights of appeal. In this way, the right to appeal had existed since the Constitution came into effect but could not be exercised until the Judiciary Act came into effect. However, the court also raised the possibility that sections 71 and 73 of the Constitution were \\"words of futurity\\", and described illusory rights, because the Court did not physically exist in 1901. They also noted a Privy Council case decided earlier in 1903, Walker v Walker, in which the court said that a successful litigant is entitled to know when the litigation has come to an end. Decision The High Court who heard the case. Photo taken at the first sitting of the court on 6 October 1903 shows Barton, Griffith & O'Connor seated, with court officials in the background.The Court decided that although it had certainly been brought into literal existence by the Judiciary Act, it potentially derived its authority from the Constitution. However, it chose not to resolve the question. Instead, the Court overturned the grant of leave to appeal on the grounds that leave should be granted only in cases involving a matter of public importance or a significant amount of money (defined in 1901 as GBP 300). Consequences The important question of precisely when the High Court came into existence, and from where it derives its authority, has still not been resolved. When introducing the Judiciary Act into Parliament, Alfred Deakin spoke of the strong need for a court capable both of judicial review of government and of interpreting the Constitution. In modern times also, it is widely accepted that the High Court draws its authority from the Constitution (in the vein of the Supreme Court of the United States in Marbury v. Madison). However, the High Court celebrated its centenary in 2003, one hundred years after the Judiciary Act established the first bench. The formal question of when the High Court came into existence remains unresolved although, in any case, it is largely an academic question. It is unlikely that the issue will ever again be considered by the High Court.

Another friend of his youth was the painter Ad Reinhardt. After a long period of drifting from job to job about the world, Lax settled on the island of Patmos during the latter part of his life. Considered by some to be a self-exiled hermit, he nonetheless welcomed visitors to his home, but did nothing to court publicity or expand his literary career or reputation.‚ÄùRobert Lax, Enigmatic Hermit‚Äù, Hermitary, 2004] Life Lax was born in Olean, New York on November 30, 1915, to Sigmund and Rebecca Lax. His father had immigrated to the United States from Austria at the age of sixteen. When Robert was in eighth grade, the family moved to Elmhurst, Queens. He first met the future painter Ad Reinhardt at Elmhurst's Newtown High School.McGregor 2017, p.10 Lax attended Columbia University in New York City, where he studied with the poet and critic Mark Van Doren. As a student there in the late 1930s, he worked on the college humor magazine, Jester with a classmate who became a close lifetime friend, Thomas Merton. Others on the Jester staff were Ed Rice, founder and editor of Jubilee magazine (to which all three men contributed in the 1950s and ¬π60s) and Ad Reinhardt.McGregor 2017 In his biography, The Seven Storey Mountain, Merton describes Lax at a meeting with other Jester staff: \\"Taller than them all, and more serious, with a long face, like a horse, and a great mane of black hair on top of it, Bob Lax meditated on some incomprehensible woe.\\"Thomas Merton, The Seven Storey Mountain, New York 1998, p.197 Mark Van Doren has commented that \\"The woe, I now believe, was that Lax could not state his bliss; his love of the world and all things, all persons in it\\". The Autobiography of Mark Van Doren, Harcourt Brace, p.212] After graduating in 1938, Lax joined the staff of The New Yorker, working his way up from assistant poetry editor; he was also poetry editor of Time magazine, wrote screenplays in Hollywood, and taught at both the University of North Carolina and Connecticut College for Women.McGregor 2017 Around 1941 he and Merton volunteered for a couple of weeks at Catherine Doherty's Friendship House in Harlem.Whittaker, Richard. \\"Remembering Robert Lax‚ÄîA Conversation with Steve Georgiou\\", Conversations, May 11, 2017 Lax converted from Judaism to Catholicism in 1943, five years after Thomas Merton, and Rice was godfather to both men. But Lax desired a simple life, so he wandered, working in circuses in Canada as a clown and expert juggler. It was travelling with the Cristiani Brothers circus in 1949 that enabled him to generate material for his collection The Circus of the Sun, although that was not published until 1959. Meanwhile, Lax had helped Rice start Jubilee, a lay Catholic magazine, in 1952 and became its roving editor. In 1953 he was in Paris, writing for a small literary magazine, New Story. By 1962 he found his way to the Greek islands, initially settling in Kalymnos, then moving on to Patmos, where he spent his last years. Seeking relative solitude, Lax said it was important to ‚Äúput yourself in a place where Grace can flow.‚Äù The 1962-7 correspondence of Lax and Merton, written in a kind of comic argot, covered his early years in Greece and was first published as A Catch of Anti-Letters in 1978.Thomas Merton, Robert Lax, A Catch of Anti-Letters, Rowman & Littlefield, republished 1994] Later their correspondence over the years 1938-68 was published as When Prophecy Still Had a Voice.When Prophecy Still Had a Voice: The Letters of Thomas Merton and Robert Lax, University Press of Kentucky, 2001 In 1969, Lax received the National Council of the Arts Award. In 1990 he received an honorary doctorate from St. Bonaventure University, a Franciscan institution near Olean, and became its first Reginald A. Lenna Visiting Professor of English, spending three weeks giving readings on campus.\\"Award-winning teacher, Lax biographer to visit #Bonas to talk about iconic Olean poet\\", St. Bonaventure University, February 28, 2017 The university now houses the main Robert Lax archives. Additional collections of his papers are at Columbia and Georgetown University.

You Tube He moved back to Olean in 2000, leaving Europe by ship from Southampton, accompanied by his niece and her husband, as he would not travel by air. Shortly after, on September 26, 2000, he died in his sleep at age 84. Writing Lax wrote hundreds of poems and dozens of books in his long career,Lax bibliography but never reached the level of recognition that some of his peers say he deserves. Jack Kerouac, whom he knew in New York, called Lax \\"one of the great original voices of our times ...a Pilgrim in search of beautiful innocence\\".Hirschfield, Robert. \\"Robert Lax: A Life slowly Lived\\", Beshara Magazine, issue 12, 2019 Circus of the Sun, a collection of poems metaphorically comparing the circus to Creation, was one of his most acclaimed works. On its publication in 1959, The New York Times hailed it as \\"perhaps the greatest English-language poem of this century.\\"Timothy J. Keiderling, \\"Bard of God‚Äôs Circus: in search of Robert Lax\\", Plough Quarterly #7, Winter 2016 An excerpt was later distributed to those attending Lax's funeral at St. Bonaventure University on 29 September 29, 2000. :And in the beginning was love. Love made a sphere: :all things grew within it; the sphere then encompassed :beginnings and endings, beginning and end. Love :had a compass whose whirling dance traced out a :sphere of love in the void: in the center thereof :rose a fountain.From towards the end of the \\"Morning\\" section Over the years following the composition of Circus of the Sun, Lax's poetry became more and more stripped down to essentials, concentrating on simplicity and making the most out of the fewest components, a technique common to artistic minimalism. Sometimes these pieces consisted of single words, even single syllables, running page after page. As a consequence his work was perceived as sharing the characteristics of Concrete poetry and was included in Stephen Bann‚Äôs defining Poetry: An International Anthology (1967) and mentioned in Mary Ellen Solt‚Äôs study, Concrete Poetry: A World View (1968).Chapter 18, \\"United States\\", Ubu Web Lax certainly shared an interest in artistic procedures with his friend Ad Reinhardt and reflected that artist‚Äôs series of black paintings in his own \\"Homage to Reinhardt\\": ::black/black/black// ::blue/blue/blue// ::black/black/black/black// ::blue/blue/blueJack Kalmitz,Views, Seawall Press 2012, pp.70-71 Specialist presses supported such gestures and brought out limited editions, such as the series of hand-written color poems that appeared as silkscreens from Edizioni Francesco Conz.Silkscreen on cloth, 1991 Even words were dispensed with in some of the 1971 publications from Journeyman Press. Mostly Blue consists of graph paper filled in with colored squares,A flick-through view at Abe Books while Another Red Red Blue Poem is composed of thin bars of those colors. In an interview with Nicholas Zurbrugg, Lax later commented on his adoption of minimalist abstraction that \\"conversations with Reinhardt, and his directions in painting, certainly had an influence on my writing. Sometimes not specifically, but the general direction that he was working in certainly did‚Äîtowards reducing the number of colours, reducing the form, and repeating the theme.\\"The ABCs of Robert Lax, Stride Publications 1999, p.28 On another occasion he explained the creation of thin vertical columns of a few numbers or a single capital letterSee Alexander 2004, p.118 as arising from the wish to adopt the methods of abstract painters, \\"trying to find what the essence for me of a traditional poem is, and getting it down to that. . . . I wanted to see what it would be. I wanted to do it with the simplest elements.\\"Speaking Into Silence, Stride, 2001, p.42 In other instances, Lax used repetition of a few words either as a device for instilling a sense of serenity or to create a sense of surprise in the reader when a change in the pattern occurs. Despite the limited vocabulary of his poems, some create narratives, while others seem more like examples for use in meditative practice or even spiritual discipline. This can be experienced in the tape made of a 1974 performance of Lax's poems given by himself and Robert Wolf in 1974, resembling an uninflected incantation.A reading from Sea & Sky, Black & White at SoundCloud When Mark Van Doren expressed his doubt about Lax's change in direction, the poet suggested that he might appreciate them more by reading them aloud in this way.Alexander 2004, p.116 Karen Alexander comments on Lax's 1985 \\"Dark Earth Bright Sky\\", in which just those four words are repeated in different permutations: \\"We could not be more familiar with the simple contrasting elements in this poem, but we often allow the clutter of our lives to obscure our awareness of them. Lax meditates upon them and presents them anew‚Ä¶ This is truly essential poetry, poetry with its roots deep in the universal foundation of the human consciousness\\". Alexander 2017, p.214] And Ryo Yamaguchi, in drawing a parallel between Lax's poetry and the minimalist procedures in the art of Donald Judd and in the music of Philip Glass and Steve Reich, also acknowledges the overlap into spirituality characteristic of the latter two.Ryo Yamaguchi, Michigan Quarterly Review,June 2015 Spirituality In the blurb for 33 Poems, William Maxwell, who had worked on The New Yorker with the poet, is quoted as commenting on Lax, \\"To the best of my knowledge, a saint is simply all the things that he is. If you placed him among the Old Testament figures above the south portal of Chartres, he wouldn't look odd.\\" But although his output embodies a spiritual outlook, Lax was not a doctrinaire writer. He owed as much to eastern as to western systems of spirituality. For several years, Lax practiced the method of meditation developed by Eknath Easwaran, Harford (2006) quoted Lax as stating that he engaged in \\"Formal meditation, yes, every day, for a half an hour.... the book I'm trying to follow.... I've been doing it now for three or four years.... It's called Meditation.... Author is Eknath Easwaran.... I've done it now for three years whether I'm traveling on trains or wherever. I do it for half an hour anyway...\\" (p. 273). and near the end of his life, Lax's only reading each day was from Easwaran.Harford (2006) stated that \\"In his last year on Patmos, in late 1999 and early 2000.... He [Lax] did no reading except for one quote per day from the Easwaran book\\" (p. 281). Interpretations Lax composed a 35-minute Black/White Oratorio using only nine colour-words and ‚Äòand‚Äô. This, as it was later arranged by John Beer, was to be performed by a chorus of nine to fifteen people.\\"David Bellingham Curates Robert Lax\\", The Hatchery Since 2014 there have been performances by the Los Angeles-based Readers Chorus.A 2015 Readers Chorus rendition of Robert Lax's \\"Black White Oratorio\\" on SoundCloud Between 2011-15 there have also been four visual interpretations of Lax poems by German animator Susanne Wiegner, three of them based on readings by Lax and another interpreting the printed text.Moving Poems In 2018 Kile Smith composed The Arc in the Sky on nine texts of Robert Lax, described as a 65-minute pilgrimage for unaccompanied choir.Smith‚Äôs commentaryA choral setting of ‚ÄúJerusalem‚Äù from The Arc in the Sky ‚ÄúJerusalem‚Äù on SoundCloud The following year it was released commercially by Navona Records.Short excerpts Principal poetical works * The Circus of the Sun (1959) * New Poems (1962) * Sea & Sky (1965) * 33 Poems (1988) * Rooster (1991) * A Thing That Is (1997) * Circus Days and Nights (2000) Poems online * Circus Days and Nights, The Overlook Press 2000 * Poems (1962-1997), Wave Books 2013 * A web anthology * \\"5 Poems\\" 1962-70, Light & Dust * \\"Kalymnos: November 29, 1968\\", an 11-part poem, Poetry Foundation * Red Circle Blue Square, Journeyman Press 1971 * The Peacemaker's Handbook #1-4, 2001 * \\"the port/was longing\\", Less #2, Edinburgh, Essence Press 2009 * \\"Alley Violinist\\" read by Garrison Keillor Further reading * Karen Alexander, \\"The Abstract Minimalist Poetry of Robert Lax\\", Interval(le)s ‚Äì I, 1 (Automne 2004), pp.110-124 * Sigrid Hauff: A Line in Three Circles.

Though not a direct spin-off from The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, the lead character, Major Harry Truscott, was very similar to Geoffrey Palmer's character of Jimmy in that series, and the scripts were written by Reginald Perrin's creator and writer David Nobbs. Harry Kitchener Wellington Truscott (ex Queen's Own West Mercian Lowlanders) is an inept and slightly barmy ex-army man intent on training a group of highly unlikely people into a secret paramilitary organisation. This idea first emerged in an episode of Perrin when Jimmy confided the plan to Reggie (who rubbished it) and was based on persistent and subsequently verified rumours in the 1970s press that far-right generals were secretly planning a coup to \\"rescue\\" Britain from trade union militancy. The character's name was changed because Fairly Secret Army was broadcast on Channel 4, and the television rights to The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin and its characters were held by the BBC. The first series was script edited by John Cleese, whose training films company was responsible for the series. The series did not have a laughter track. Nobbs only started work on the show when he turned down an offer to write a spin-off sitcom for Manuel of Fawlty Towers.  Cast  *Geoffrey Palmer as Major Harry Truscott *Michael Robbins as Sgt.

The immediate issue concerned the Commonwealth's power under s51(xxxv) of the Constitution but the court did not confine itself to that question, using the opportunity to roam broadly over constitutional interpretation. Widely regarded as one of the most important cases ever decided by the High Court of Australia, it swept away the earlier doctrines of implied intergovernmental immunities and reserved state powers, thus paving the way for fundamental changes in the nature of federalism in Australia. BackgroundFacts= The Engineers case arose out of a claim lodged by the Amalgamated Society of Engineers against the Adelaide Steamship Company in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for an award relating to 844 employers across Australia. In Western Australia, the employers included three governmental employers. The question was whether a Commonwealth law made under the \\"conciliation and arbitration\\" power regarding industrial disputes, section 51(xxxv), could authorise the making of an award binding the three employers. The case came before the Full Court on a case stated under the Judiciary Act. Reference to Full Court. =Previous approach to constitutional interpretation= The three original judges of the High Court, Griffith CJ, Barton and O'Connor JJ, and the two new judges appointed in 1906, Isaacs and Higgins JJ, had all been leading participants in the Constitutional Conventions and all are properly seen as among the framers of the Constitution, at [48]-[49] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ. The Court described the Constitution as \\"framed in Australia by Australians, and for the use of the Australian people\\",. thus when the Court spoke of what framers of the Constitution knew, intended or expected,; . they were referring to their personal experience in that process, and not to the intention or knowledge of the Imperial Parliament in passing the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900.Higgins J noted in at p. 1169-70 that in relation to section 74 of the Constitution the question of intention may be a reference to the intention of the Conventions, the Australian voters who approved the draft constitution, the Australian delegates in London who negotiated the passage of the constitution, the British law officers who redrafted section 74 or to the Houses of the British Parliament who passed the Constitution Act 1900 (Imp). In Webb v Outtrim,; . the Privy Council criticised the High Court's approach to the interpretation of the constitution, holding that the relevant question was not the intention of the Australians who framed the Constitution, but rather what the British Parliament had in mind when it passed the Constitution Act. Despite the criticism, and the challenge by the new appointments to the Court from 1906, the original members of the High Court maintained and continued their approach to constitutional interpretation.. Union label case (1908) 6 CLR 469 at p. 514 per Griffith CJ. Huddart, Parker & Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead (1909) 8 CLR 330 at p. 563 per Barton J. =Implied intergovernmental immunities= The original High Court tended to employ the US jurisprudence governing intergovernmental immunity, expressing it as an implied immunity of instrumentalities, where neither the Commonwealth nor State governments could be affected by the laws of the other. (2003) 31 Federal Law Review 507 at p. 508. This was first expressed in D'Emden v Pedder,. Deakin v Webb,. and the Railway Servants' case.. As Griffith CJ declared in the first case: > In considering the respective powers of the Commonwealth and of the States > it is essential to bear in mind that each is, within the ambit of its > authority, a sovereign State, subject only to the restrictions imposed by > the Imperial connection and to the provisions of the Constitution, either > expressed or necessarily implied... a right of sovereignty subject to > extrinsic control is a contradiction in terms. =Reserved state powers= The reserved powers doctrine was a principle used in the interpretation of the Constitution that emphasised the context of the Constitution, drawing on principles of federalism, what the court saw as the compact between the newly formed Commonwealth and the former colonies, particularly the compromises that informed the text of the constitution. The doctrine involved a restrictive approach to the interpretation of the specific powers of the Federal Parliament to preserve the powers that were intended to be left to the states. =Changes to the composition of the court= The appointment or departure of a judge from the High Court can change the dynamics within the court. From 1906 to 1913 there had been five appointments,Isaacs, Higgins, Gavan Duffy Powers and Rich. Piddington was appointed in 1913 but never sat as a judge. and the death of O'Connor J in 1912. These changes did not however generally change the approach of the High Court. The first sign of significant change was in the 1919 Municipalities Case where it was held that municipal corporations responsible for the making, maintenance, control and lighting of public streets were not State instrumentalities.. More dramatic consequences flowed, however, from the retirement of Griffith CJ in 1919, the death of Barton J in 1920 and their replacement by Knox CJ and Starke J. The change was described as the departure of statesmen, who interpreted the constitution as a political compact and their replacement by legalists and nationalists, who interpreted it as a legal document. =Argument= The Engineers were represented by Robert Menzies, then a junior barrister. His account of the hearing in Melbourne on 24 May 1920 before the High Court is that he argued that the government sawmills in Western Australia were not state instrumentalities, as they were trading rather than government enterprises. Menzies records Starke J as describing the argument as nonsense and says Writing in 1995, Brennan CJ had access to the notebooks of both Knox CJ and Isaacs J, from which he concluded that \\"It seems quite clear that Menzies lit the fuse in Melbourne, though the main charge for exploding the notion of reciprocal supremacy seems to have been prepared by Isaacs and Rich JJ. in the Municipalities Case. Yet it was Leverrier's,Leverrier , counsel for the Commonwealth rather than Menzies' advocacy which seems to have had the greatest impact\\". Judgment The joint majority judgment of Knox CJ, Isaacs, Rich & Starke JJ was delivered by Isaacs J and its authorship is commonly attributed to him based on its style which was long, rhetorical and polemic. Higgins J wrote a separate opinion but came to a similar conclusion. Gavan Duffy J dissented. The joint majority opinion of the Court reviewed the jurisprudence of the Griffith Court and declared:' (1920) 28 CLR 129 at pp. 141‚Äì2 per Knox CJ, Isaacs, Rich & Starke JJ. > The more the decisions are examined, and compared with each other and with > the Constitution itself, the more evident it becomes that no clear principle > can account for them. They are sometimes at variance with the natural > meaning of the text of the Constitution; some are irreconcilable with > others, and some are individually rested on reasons not founded on the words > of the Constitution or on any recognized principle of the common law > underlying the expressed terms of the Constitution, but on implication drawn > from what is called the principle of 'necessity', that being itself > referable to no more definite standard than the personal opinion of the > Judge who declares it. The judgment then returned to first principles on how the Constitution is to be interpreted. The use of American precedent was rejected in favour of applying the settled rules of construction that gave primacy to the text of the Constitution and anchored its interpretation to its express words. Some \\"reservations\\" were made about State prerogatives and special Commonwealth powers (like over taxation); the reservations eventually became subsumed within some general intergovernmental immunity rules to emerge as the Melbourne Corporation doctrine. The Court considered its earlier decision in D'Emden v Pedder,. which had been the foundation case for the original intergovernmental immunities doctrine. It has been said that the Engineers case attacks the reasoning in D'Emden, but rationalises the conclusion. A later case (Attorney-General for Queensland v Attorney-General for the Commonwealth). that applied D'Emden was attacked as resting on opinions \\"as to hopes and expectations respecting vague external conditions\\". The joint majority judgment then went on to establish that the Crown in its various capacities is bound by the Constitution. The power of the Commonwealth to bind the States was seen as an aspect of the general conclusion. Its reasoning invoked the notion of the one and indivisible Crown, which is no longer part of Australian jurisprudence, but that conclusion is capable of being reached without such a notion. Passages of the joint majority judgment discuss the paramountcy of Commonwealth law, which foreshadow the later expansion of Constitution s109 inconsistency doctrine in Clyde Engineering Co Ltd v Cowburn:. The language of the D'Emden v Pedder non-interference principle lives on in the second (\\"rights impairment\\") test of inconsistency. Significance Former Chief Justice of Australia Sir Anthony Mason has written: (2003) 27 Melbourne University Law Review 864. > The combination of literal interpretation and a broad construction of > Commonwealth powers led to the Commonwealth assuming a dominant position in > the Australian federation vis-a-vis the states. The Engineers case ushered > in a period of literal interpretation of the Constitution. Literal > interpretation and legalism (of which Sir John Latham was the chief > exponent) were characteristic of the Court's constitutional interpretation > for the greater part of the 20th century. The decision has had its critics. In 1937, R.T.E. Latham wrote:quoted in Winterton, Lee, Glass and Thomson, Australian Federal Constitutional Law: Commentary and Materials (Law Book Co. 1999) at 757 > It cut off Australian constitutional law from American precedents, a copious > source of thoroughly relevant learning, in favour of crabbed English rules > of statutory interpretation, which are one of the sorriest features of > English law, and are... particularly unsuited to the interpretation of a > rigid Constitution.... The fundamental criticism of the decision is that its > real ground is nowhere stated in the majority judgment. On the question of the use of American and other foreign precedents, Mason wrote: > Before the Engineers case, the Court made considerable use of United States > authorities. Following the Engineers case, references to United States > authority were much less frequent. The majority remarked: \\"American > authorities... are not a secure basis on which to build fundamentally with > respect to our own Constitution [but] in secondary... matters they may... > afford considerable light and assistance.\\"' (1920) 28 CLR 129 at p. 146 per > Knox CJ, Isaacs, Rich & Starke JJ. > Much later, in the 1980s and the 1990s, the Court made extensive use of > foreign authorities and comparative law. This use of foreign precedents was > associated with the demise of the Privy Council appeal and the Court's > recognition of its responsibility to declare the law for Australia. Despite the case, doctrine can be based on an implication from the text or structure of the Constitution. Sir Owen Dixon, in particular, was critical of any such overblown reading of the Engineers case in this oft-quoted passage: \\"The prima-facie rule is that a power to legislate with respect to a given subject enables the Parliament to make laws which, upon that subject, affect the operations of the States and their agencies. That, as I have pointed out more than once, is the effect of the Engineers case stripped of embellishment and reduced to the form of a legal proposition.\\" at p. 78 per Dixon J. Earlier, he had written: \\"We should avoid pedantic and narrow constructions in dealing with an instrument of government and I do not see why we should be fearful about making implications.\\" at p. 85 per Dixon J. Writing in 1971, Windeyer J made the following assessment of the Engineers case: at p. 396-7 per Windeyer J. > The Colonies which in 1901 became States in the new Commonwealth were not > before then sovereign bodies in any strict legal sense; and certainly the > Constitution did not make them so. They were self-governing colonies which, > when the Commonwealth came into existence as a new Dominion of the Crown, > lost some of their former powers and gained no new powers. They became > components of a federation, the Commonwealth of Australia. It became a > nation. Its nationhood was in the course of time to be consolidated in war, > by economic and commercial integration, by the unifying influence of federal > law, by the decline of dependence upon British naval and military power and > by a recognition and acceptance of external interests and obligations. With > these developments the position of the Commonwealth, the federal government, > has waxed; and that of the States has waned.

It is owned by Postmedia. First published in 1980, the tabloid-format daily replaced the long-running tabloid-size newspaper The Albertan soon after it was acquired by the publishers of the Toronto Sun. The newspaper, like most of those in the Canadian \\"Sun\\" chain, is known for short, snappy news stories aimed primarily at working-class readers. The Calgary Suns layout is based somewhat upon that of British tabloids. Sunshine Girl A signature feature of the Calgary Sun‚Äîas it is with the other Sun-branded newspapers in the chain‚Äîis a daily glamour photograph of a female model entitled the \\"Sunshine Girl\\". The feature utilizes locally photographed models (both amateur and professional) as well as photographs shot for the national chain. Originally situated on Page 3 (like the UK tabloids the Sun chain originally set out to emulate, which also featured glamour photos on their third pages), in the 1990s the feature was relocated to the Sports section. A \\"Sunshine Boy\\" feature appeared sporadically in the 1980s and 1990s. Local weeklies For many years, the Calgary Sun also published a popular local weekly, The Calgary Mirror, which covered community news; the Sun organization purchased the newspaper in the early 1990s. This publication, which originated in the 1950s and was also known at one time as North Hill News, was discontinued in 2001. It was succeeded by FYI Calgary In-Print, a free weekly newspaper intended to be a print equivalent of the Sun's much-publicized FYI Calgary news website (there was also an FYI Toronto newspaper published to tie-in with the Toronto Sun's website). The new publication was rejected by readers and advertisers and was discontinued in May 2001 during a downsizing of Sun Media; the website abandoned the FYI concept about a year later and rebranded itself as Calgarysun.com. Format On October 2, 2006, the Sun underwent a major redesign, introducing a new logo (actually it finally adopted the logo used at several other Sun newspapers for several years previously), and revamping its typeface usage for both bodytext and headlines. In February 2007, Sun Media launched a Calgary edition of its free daily 24 Hours, which shares editors and editorial staff with the Calgary Sun. Sun Media ceased publishing the Calgary edition of 24 Hours in 2013. Distribution The Calgary Herald was produced on a daily basis up until 2012 when it ceased printing a Sunday edition. Distribution is done by subscription, direct sale (such as at newsstands), or by newspaper box. The latter was the target of public debate by City Council in early 2008 when at least one alderman claimed that newspaper boxes were responsible for increased states of litter on public transit.  Circulation  The Calgary Sun has seen like most Canadian daily newspapers a decline in circulation. Its total circulation dropped by percent to 43,277 copies daily from 2009 to 2015. :::::::::Daily average Figures refer to the total circulation (print and digital combined) which includes paid and unpaid copies.

The ship was the first U.S. Navy vessel named in honor of U.S. Navy officers Jonathan Wainwright, his cousin, Commander Richard Wainwright, and his son, Jonathan Wainwright, Jr.. Wainwright was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding of Camden, New Jersey, in September 1914 and launched in June of the following year. The ship was a little more than in length, just under abeam, and had a standard displacement of . She was armed with four guns and had eight 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. Wainwright was powered by a pair of steam turbines that propelled her at up to . After her May 1916 commissioning, Wainwright sailed in the Atlantic and the Caribbean. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Wainwright was part of the first U.S. destroyer squadron sent overseas. Patrolling the Irish Sea out of Queenstown, Ireland, Wainwright made several unsuccessful attacks on U-boats, and rescued survivors of several ships sunk by the German craft. Upon returning to the United State after the war, Wainwright resumed operations with the destroyers of the Atlantic Fleet until May 1922, when she was decommissioned. In April 1926, Wainwright was transferred to the United States Coast Guard to help enforce Prohibition as a part of the \\"Rum Patrol\\". She operated under the name USCGC Wainwright (CG-24) until April 1934, when she was returned to the Navy. She was sold for scrap in August 1934.  Design and construction  Wainwright was authorized in 1913 as the sixth and final ship of the which, like the related , was an improved version of the s authorized in 1911. Construction of the vessel was awarded to New York Shipbuilding of Camden, New Jersey, which laid down her keel on 1 September 1914. Just over nine months later, on 12 June 1915, Wainwright was launched by sponsor Miss Evelyn Wainwright Turpin, a descendant of the ship's namesakes, Commodore Jonathan Wainwright (1821‚Äì1863), his cousin Richard Wainwright (1817‚Äì1862), and son Jonathan Wainwright, Jr. (1849‚Äì1870), all U.S. Navy officers that died while serving. As built, Wainwright was in length and abeam and drew . The ship had a standard displacement of and displaced when fully loaded. Evelyn Wainwright Turpin, Wainwrights sponsor at launch; Miss Turpin was the great-granddaughter of Commodore Jonathan Wainwright, one of the ship's namesakes Wainwright had two Curtis steam turbines that drove her two screw propellers, and an additional steam turbine geared to one of the propeller shafts for cruising purposes. The power plant could generate and move the ship at speeds up to . Wainwrights main battery consisted of four /50 Mark 9 guns,The 50 denotes the length of the gun barrels; in this case, the gun is 50 calibers, meaning that the gun is 50 times as long as it is in diameter, in this case. The Mark number is the version of the gun; in this case, the ninth U.S. Navy design of the 4-inch/50 gun. with each gun weighing in excess of . The guns fired armor-piercing projectiles at . At an elevation of 20¬∞, the guns had a range of . Wainwright was also equipped with eight torpedo tubes. The General Board of the United States Navy had called for two anti-aircraft guns for the Tucker-class ships, as well as provisions for laying up to 36 floating mines. From sources, it is unclear if these recommendations were followed for Wainwright or any of the other ships of the class.  Early career  USS Wainwright was commissioned into the United States Navy on 12 May 1916 under the command of Lieutenant Fred H. Poteet. After fitting out at Philadelphia, the destroyer rounded Cape May on 20 June and headed for Newport, Rhode Island, to load torpedoes before joining Division 8 of the Atlantic Fleet Destroyer Flotilla. Following exercises near Eastport, Maine, she remained on the New England coast until mid-September when she headed south for gunnery tests and training off the Virginia capes. Upon the completion of a fortnight's gun drills, the ship then returned to Buzzard's Bay, Massachusetts, on 2 October. Later that month, Wainwright operated out of Newport, practiced torpedo tactics near Vineyard Sound, and visited New York to pick up cargo for the flotilla's tender, . She returned to Newport on the 18th and, eight days later, resumed torpedo practice near Vineyard Sound for the remainder of the month. She put into Boston, Massachusetts on 1 November for extensive repairs in the navy yard. Refurbished, the destroyer got underway for the Caribbean on 8 January 1917. Steaming via Hampton Roads, Virginia, she reached Culebra Island, near Puerto Rico, on the 14th and conducted war games exercises with the Atlantic Fleet. In the course of those operations, she visited the Dominican Republic as well as Guantanamo Bay and Santiago in Cuba. Later that month, Wainwright carried Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt; Brigadier General George Barnett, the Commandant of the Marine Corps; and the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission from Santiago to Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Following that assignment, Wainwright conducted torpedo exercises, patrols, and power trials near Guantanamo Bay until the beginning of March. She returned to Boston on 10 March for a short period in the Navy Yard. On 31 March, she departed Boston for Hampton Roads where she arrived on 2 April. The following morning, in response to the imminent threat of war with Germany, Wainwright began to search for submarines and to patrol Hampton Roads to protect the Fleet and naval bases. Two days later, other warships relieved her on patrol; and she anchored with the Fleet in the mouth of the York River. The next day, 6 April 1917, the United States entered World War I.  World War I  By the spring of 1917, the unrestricted submarine warfare campaign‚Äîwhich Germany had launched at the beginning of February‚Äîhad so succeeded that the entire Allied war effort was endangered. Strong reinforcements to the Allied antisubmarine forces were desperately needed to avert defeat and needed at once. In response to a request from the Royal Navy for the service of American antisubmarine warfare ships in European waters, the United States Navy began sending destroyers eastward across the Atlantic. Wainwright again briefly patrolled Hampton Roads before heading for the New York Navy Yard on 14 April, and on to Boston, where she arrived two days later, to prepare for overseas duty. On 24 April, the destroyer departed Boston in company with , , , , and , bound for the British Isles. This division‚Äîled by Commander Joseph K. Taussig‚Äîwas the first American naval unit to be sent to Europe. The destroyers reached Queenstown on the southern coast of Ireland on 4 May and, after fueling, began patrolling the southern approaches to Liverpool and other British ports on the coast of the Irish Sea. Wainwright reported her first scrape with a German submarine on 11 May. She sighted an abandoned lifeboat at about 08:00. After investigating the drifting boat for occupants and finding none, she sank the boat with gunfire. At about 08:15, a lookout reported that a torpedo had missed the destroyer some astern. Wainwright then fired several rounds from her guns at what was thought to be a periscope. The supposed submarine disappeared soon thereafter; and, despite a thorough investigation of the area, the destroyer could turn up no more evidence of the presence of a U-boat. Wainwright (right) alongside destroyer tender at Brest in 1918 The summer of 1917 provided few opportunities for Wainwright to test her sub- killing techniques. On 4 July, a member of the destroyer's crew spotted a purported periscope and soon thereafter others claimed that a torpedo was reported to have passed the ship, astern. Wainwright depth-charged the last indicated position of the undersea raider but to no avail. On the morning of 20 August, after brought up some oil with one of her depth charges, Wainwright dropped a couple of depth charges as she passed through the faint slick. A few minutes later, she joined other ships in some sporadic gunfire but failed to prove that a submarine was in the area. The fall, on the other hand, brought Wainwright increased activity. After spending the first two weeks of September in repairs at Birkenhead, near Liverpool, she departed the yard at Laird Basin at about 07:00 on the 14th to return to Queenstown. Three quarters of an hour into the afternoon watch, she received orders sending her to the scene of a submarine attack against an Allied merchantman some south-southeast of Helvick Head, Ireland. Wainwright rang up full speed, made off for the reported location, and began a search for the U-boat in conjunction with a British dirigible and other surface units. Near the end of the second dog watch, she sighted the submarine's conning tower and bow about off. Wainwright charged to the attack, but the submarine submerged almost immediately. Upon reaching the spot where the submarine had been, the warship located an oil slick and began dropping depth charges which failed to achieve positive results. Approaching darkness and the necessity of escorting an Admiralty oiler forced Wainwright to break off her attack. After she shepherded the oiler to safety, she returned to the area of her attack and patrolled throughout the night, but the submarine had apparently retired from the neighborhood. Four days later, while searching for a U-boat in the area of Conigbeg Rock, the destroyer received word that the Conigbeg Lightship had rescued survivors from a fishing vessel. Wainwright rendezvoused with the craft to interview the four seamen of the smack Our Bairns. They revealed that the U-boat‚Äîwhich turned out to be ‚Äîwas of the latest type Germany had in action. The destroyer relieved the lighthouse vessel of the four fishermen and continued the search until dusk, when she headed back to Queenstown to land the rescued men. For a month, she carried on conducting routine patrols. Action finally came on the morning of 18 October, when Wainwright again received orders to Helvick Head to hunt for an enemy submarine. She arrived at the designated location at about 11:15 and searched for more than two hours for clues as to the U-boat's location. Then, at 13:58, she sighted a submarine's conning tower about off her starboard bow. The enemy appeared to be maneuvering into position for a torpedo attack but submerged the moment Wainwright charged to the attack. When the destroyer reached the estimated location of the U-boat, she dropped a depth charge and then a buoy to mark the spot. The warship followed that maneuver with a systematic, circular search out to a radius of . Having found nothing by 04:00 the following morning, she gave up and shaped a course for Queenstown. The ensuing six months brought no new encounters with U-boats. She scouted areas where submarines had been reported but neither sighted nor engaged the enemy. On one occasion, she collided with a merchantman, , and had to enter the drydock at Spencer Jetty that same day, 24 November 1917, for repairs. While steaming generally south on 29 April 1918, she sighted a sail bearing almost due west whose hull was down below the horizon. By the time the destroyer had swung around to an intercepting course, the sail had disappeared. While the destroyer steamed toward the estimated position of the sail, she searched for evidence of a submarine. After covering westward, she came upon an area marked by a number of small oil slicks. Wainwright chose the most promising of the slicks and dropped four depth charges. She then commenced another fruitless search which ended at midnight when she received orders to return to Queenstown. New York on 20 May 1921 Wainwright continued to operate out of Queenstown until June 1918 when she was reassigned to United States naval forces in France. On the 8th, she reported for duty at Brest, the French port from which she conducted her patrols for the remainder of the war. Those patrols brought no further encounters with the enemy. Only two events of note occurred between June and November 1918. On the night of 19/20 October, she sighted what appeared to be a submarine running on the surface. However, upon closer inspection, the object proved to be a derelict carrying the crew of the 77-ton Portuguese schooner Aida, which had been captured by German submarine and sunk with explosive charges. Wainwright took on the survivors and saw them safely into port. Later, during the evening of 1 November, heavy winds at Brest caused the destroyer to drag anchor: and she struck the breakwater. After had failed to pull her loose, the tug took over and finally managed to refloat the warship at 19:20 and towed her into Brest. Hostilities ended on 11 November 1918, and Wainwright returned home early in 1919 to resume duty with the Atlantic Fleet destroyers. She operated along the east coast and in the Caribbean until 19 May 1922 when she was decommissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The destroyer remained in reserve until the spring of 1926.  Coast Guard career  Wainwright in Coast Guard service, c. 1924‚Äì33 On 17 January 1920, Prohibition was instituted by law in the United States. Soon, the smuggling of alcoholic beverages along the coastlines of the United States became widespread and blatant. The Treasury Department eventually determined that the United States Coast Guard simply did not have the ships to constitute a successful patrol. To cope with the problem, President Calvin Coolidge in 1924 authorized the transfer from the Navy to the Coast Guard of twenty old destroyers that were in reserve and out of commission. Wainwright was activated and acquired by the Coast Guard on 2 April 1926, as part of a second group of five to augment the original twenty. Wainwright moved to Boston on 22 May and remained there until 27 July when she got underway for the Connecticut coast. She reached New London, two days later; and, on the 30th, she was commissioned by the Coast Guard. The warship retained her name while serving with the Coast Guard's \\"Rum Patrol\\" to suppress the illegal importation of alcoholic beverages. She served at New London from the summer of 1926 until 1929. On 4 January 1929, she headed south to Charleston, South Carolina, whence she conducted gunnery practice until 4 February when she returned north to Boston. In January 1930, she headed south again for gunnery practice but this time at St. Petersburg, Florida. During each of the two succeeding years‚Äîin January 1931 and late in March 1932‚Äîshe returned to St. Petersburg for a month of target practice and afterward resumed her duties along the New England coast. In May 1933, her permanent duty station was changed to New York, and she reported there at the end of the first week in June. After a summer of normal operations, the warship began target practice at Hampton Roads, on 7 September. U.S. Navy duty in Cuba That duty, however, was interrupted on the 9th by orders to report for duty with the Navy in the area of the Florida Strait during the series of revolts in Cuba which finally resulted in the beginning of Fulgencio Batista's 25-year rule. On 6 November, Wainwright was released from duty with the Navy and was ordered back to New York. Return to Coast Guard duty Wainwright arrived three days later and resumed duties with the Coast Guard until March 1934. On the 14th, she departed the station at Stapleton, New York, and arrived in Philadelphia the following day. She was decommissioned by the Coast Guard on 29 March. Return to Navy, decommissioning, and disposal On 27 April, the Commandant, 4th Naval District, took possession of Wainwright for the Navy. Her name was reinstated on the Navy list briefly but was struck once again on 5 July 1934. On 22 August, she was sold to Michael Flynn, Inc., of Brooklyn, New York, for scrapping.

The title is a reference to Aristotle's work Organon, which was his treatise on logic and syllogism. In Novum Organum, Bacon details a new system of logic he believes to be superior to the old ways of syllogism. This is now known as the Baconian method. For Bacon, finding the essence of a thing was a simple process of reduction, and the use of inductive reasoning. In finding the cause of a 'phenomenal nature' such as heat, one must list all of the situations where heat is found. Then another list should be drawn up, listing situations that are similar to those of the first list except for the lack of heat. A third table lists situations where heat can vary. The 'form nature', or cause, of heat must be that which is common to all instances in the first table, is lacking from all instances of the second table and varies by degree in instances of the third table. The title page of Novum Organum depicts a galleon passing between the mythical Pillars of Hercules that stand either side of the Strait of Gibraltar, marking the exit from the well-charted waters of the Mediterranean into the Atlantic Ocean. The Pillars, as the boundary of the Mediterranean, have been smashed through by Iberian sailors, opening a new world for exploration. Bacon hopes that empirical investigation will, similarly, smash the old scientific ideas and lead to greater understanding of the world and heavens. This title page was liberally copied from Andr√©s Garc√≠a de C√©spedes's Regimiento de Navegaci√≥n, published in 1606. The Latin tag across the bottom ‚Äì Multi pertransibunt & augebitur scientia ‚Äì is taken from the Old Testament (Daniel 12:4). It means: \\"Many will travel and knowledge will be increased\\". Bacon and the scientific method Bacon's work was instrumental in the historical development of the scientific method. His technique bears a resemblance to the modern formulation of the scientific method in the sense that it is centered on experimental research. Bacon's emphasis on the use of artificial experiments to provide additional observances of a phenomenon is one reason that he is often considered \\"the Father of the Experimental Philosophy\\" (for example famously by Voltaire). On the other hand, modern scientific method does not follow Bacon's methods in its details, but more in the spirit of being methodical and experimental, and so his position in this regard can be disputed.Rees, Graham and Maria Wakely The Instauratio Magna, Part II: Novum organum and Associated Texts. Oxford: Clarendon, 2004. Print Importantly though, Bacon set the scene for science to develop various methodologies, because he made the case against older Aristotelian approaches to science, arguing that method was needed because of the natural biases and weaknesses of the human mind, including the natural bias it has to seek metaphysical explanations which are not based on real observations. Preface Bacon begins the work with a rejection of pure a priori deduction as a means of discovering truth in natural philosophy. Of his philosophy, he states: > Now my plan is as easy to describe as it is difficult to effect. For it is > to establish degrees of certainty, take care of the sense by a kind of > reduction, but to reject for the most part the work of the mind that follows > upon sense; in fact I mean to open up and lay down a new and certain pathway > from the perceptions of the senses themselves to the mind. The emphasis on beginning with observation pervades the entire work. In fact, it is in the idea that natural philosophy must begin with the senses that we find the revolutionary part of Bacon's philosophy, and its consequent philosophical method, eliminative induction, is one of Bacon's most lasting contributions to science and philosophy. Instauratio Magna Novum organum was actually published as part of a much larger work, Instauratio Magna (\\"The Great Instauration\\"). The word instauration was intended to show that the state of human knowledge was to simultaneously press forward while also returning to that enjoyed by man before the Fall. Originally intending Instauratio Magna to contain six parts (of which Novum organum constituted the second), Bacon did not come close to completing this series, as parts V and VI were never written at all. Novum organum, written in Latin and consisting of two books of aphorisms, was included in the volume that Bacon published in 1620; however, it was also unfinished, as Bacon promised several additions to its content which ultimately remained unprinted. Book I Bacon titled this first book Aphorismi de Interpretatione Naturae et Regno Hominis (\\"Aphorisms Concerning the Interpretation of Nature, and the Kingdom of Man\\"). In the first book of aphorisms, Bacon criticizes the current state of natural philosophy. The object of his assault consists largely in the syllogism, a method that he believes to be completely inadequate in comparison to what Bacon calls \\"true Induction\\": In many of his aphorisms, Bacon reiterates the importance of inductive reasoning. Induction, methodologically opposed to deduction, entails beginning with particular cases observed by the senses and then attempting to discover the general axioms from those observations. In other words, induction presupposes nothing. Deduction, on the other hand, begins with general axioms, or first principles, by which the truth of particular cases is extrapolated. Bacon emphasises the strength of the gradual process that is inherent in induction: After many similar aphoristic reiterations of these important concepts, Bacon presents his famous Idols. The Idols (')  Novum organum, as suggested by its name, is focused just as much on a rejection of received doctrine as it is on a forward-looking progression. In Bacon's Idols are found his most critical examination of man- made impediments which mislead the mind's objective reasoning. They appear in previous works but were never fully fleshed out until their formulation in Novum organum: ;Idols of the Tribe (') \\"Idols of the Tribe are rooted in human nature itself and in the very tribe or race of men. For people falsely claim that human sense is the measure of things, whereas in fact all perceptions of sense and mind are built to the scale of man and not the universe.\\" (Aphorism 41.) Bacon includes in this idol the predilection of the human imagination to presuppose otherwise unsubstantiated regularities in nature. An example might be the common historical astronomical assumption that planets move in perfect circles. ;Idols of the Cave (') These \\"belong to the particular individual. For everyone has (besides vagaries of human nature in general) his own special cave or den which scatters and discolours the light of nature. Now this comes either of his own unique and singular nature; or his education and association with others, or the books he reads and the several authorities of those whom he cultivates and admires, or the different impressions as they meet in the soul, be the soul possessed and prejudiced, or steady and settled, or the like; so that the human spirit (as it is allotted to particular individuals) is evidently a variable thing, all muddled, and so to speak a creature of chance...\\" (Aphorism 42). This type of idol stems from the particular life experiences of the individual. Variable educations can lead the individual to a preference for specific concepts or methods, which then corrupt their subsequent philosophies. Bacon himself gives the example of Aristotle, \\"who made his natural philosophy a mere slave to his logic\\". (Aphorism 54.) ;Idols of the Market (') These are \\"derived as if from the mutual agreement and association of the human race, which I call Idols of the Market on account of men's commerce and partnerships. For men associate through conversation, but words are applied according to the capacity of ordinary people. Therefore shoddy and inept application of words lays siege to the intellect in wondrous ways\\" (Aphorism 43). Bacon considered these \\"the greatest nuisances of them all\\" (Aphorism 59). Because humans reason through the use of words they are particularly dangerous, because the received definitions of words, which are often falsely derived, can cause confusion. He outlines two subsets of this kind of idol and provides examples (Aphorism 60). *First, there are those words which spring from fallacious theories, such as the element of fire or the concept of a first mover. These are easy to dismantle because their inadequacy can be traced back to the fault of their derivation in a faulty theory. *Second, there are those words that are the result of imprecise abstraction. Earth, for example, is a vague term that may include many different substances the commonality of which is questionable. These terms are often used elliptically, or from a lack of information or definition of the term. ;Idols of the Theatre (') \\"Lastly, there are the Idols which have misguided into men's souls from the dogmas of the philosophers and misguided laws of demonstration as well; I call these Idols of the Theatre, for in my eyes the philosophies received and discovered are so many stories made up and acted out stories which have created sham worlds worth of the stage.\\" (Aphorism 44.) These idols manifest themselves in the unwise acceptance of certain philosophical dogmas, namely Aristotle's sophistical natural philosophy (named specifically in Aphorism 63) which was corrupted by his passion for logic, and Plato's superstitious philosophy, which relied too heavily on theological principles. Book II After enumerating the shortcomings of the current and past natural philosophies, Bacon can now present his own philosophy and methods. Bacon retains the Aristotelian causes, but redefines them in interesting ways. While traditionally the final cause was held as most important among the four (material, formal, efficient, and final), Bacon claims that it is the least helpful and in some cases actually detrimental to the sciences (aph. 2). For Bacon, it is the formal cause which is both the most illusive and most valuable, although each of the causes provides certain practical devices. By forms and formal causes, Bacon means the universal laws of nature. To these Bacon attaches an almost occult like power: > But he who knows forms grasps the unity of nature beneath the surface of > materials which are very unlike. Thus is he able to identify and bring about > things that have never been done before, things of the kind which neither > the vicissitudes of nature, nor hard experimenting, nor pure accident could > ever have actualised, or human thought dreamed of. And thus from the > discovery of the forms flows true speculation and unrestricted operation > (aphorism 3) In this second book, Bacon offers an example of the process that of what he calls true induction. In this example, Bacon attempts to grasp the form of heat. The first step he takes is the surveying of all known instances where the nature of heat appears to exist. To this compilation of observational data Bacon gives the name Table of Essence and Presence. The next table, the Table of Absence in Proximity, is essentially the opposite‚Äîa compilation of all the instances in which the nature of heat is not present. Because these are so numerous, Bacon enumerates only the most relevant cases. Lastly, Bacon attempts to categorise the instances of the nature of heat into various degrees of intensity in his Table of Degrees. The aim of this final table is to eliminate certain instances of heat which might be said to be the form of heat, and thus get closer to an approximation of the true form of heat. Such elimination occurs through comparison. For example, the observation that both a fire and boiling water are instances of heat allows us to exclude light as the true form of heat, because light is present in the case of the fire but not in the case of the boiling water. Through this comparative analysis, Bacon intends to eventually extrapolate the true form of heat, although it is clear that such a goal is only gradually approachable by degrees. Indeed, the hypothesis that is derived from this eliminative induction, which Bacon names The First Vintage, is only the starting point from which additional empirical evidence and experimental analysis can refine our conception of a formal cause. The \\"Baconian method\\" does not end at the First Vintage. Bacon described numerous classes of Instances with Special Powers, cases in which the phenomenon one is attempting to explain is particularly relevant. These instances, of which Bacon describes 27 in Novum Organum, aid and accelerate the process of induction. They are \\"labour-saving devices or shortcuts intended to accelerate or make more rigorous the search for forms by providing logical reinforcement to induction.\\" Aside from the First Vintage and the Instances with Special Powers, Bacon enumerates additional \\"aids to the intellect\\" which presumably are the next steps in his \\"method.\\" In Aphorism 21 of Book II, Bacon lays out the subsequent series of steps in proper induction: including Supports to Induction, Rectification of Induction, Varying the Inquiry according to the Nature of the Subject, Natures with Special Powers, Ends of Inquiry, Bringing Things down to Practice, Preparatives to Inquiry and Ascending and Descending Scale of Axioms. These additional aids, however, were never explained beyond their initial limited appearance in Novum Organum. It is likely that Bacon intended them to be included in later parts of Instauratio magna and simply never got to writing about them. As mentioned above, this second book of Novum organum was far from complete and indeed was only a small part of a massive, also unfinished work, the Instauratio magna. Bacon and Descartes Bacon is often studied through a comparison to his contemporary Ren√© Descartes. Both thinkers were, in a sense, some of the first to question the philosophical authority of the ancient Greeks. Bacon and Descartes both believed that a critique of preexisting natural philosophy was necessary, but their respective critiques proposed radically different approaches to natural philosophy. Two over-lapping movements developed; \\"one was rational and theoretical in approach and was headed by Rene Descartes; the other was practical and empirical and was led by Francis Bacon.\\"Cantor, Norman F., and Peter L. Klein. Seventeenth-Century Rationalism: Bacon and Descartes. Massachusetts: Blaisdell, 1969. Print They were both profoundly concerned with the extent to which humans can come to knowledge, and yet their methods of doing so projected diverging paths. On the one hand, Descartes begins with a doubt of anything which cannot be known with absolute certainty and includes in this realm of doubt the impressions of sense perception, and thus, \\"all sciences of corporal things, such as physics and astronomy.\\" He thus attempts to provide a metaphysical principle (this becomes the Cogito) which cannot be doubted, on which further truths must be deduced. In this method of deduction, the philosopher begins by examining the most general axioms (such as the Cogito), and then proceeds to determine the truth about particulars from an understanding of those general axioms. Conversely, Bacon endorsed the opposite method of Induction, in which the particulars are first examined, and only then is there a gradual ascent to the most general axioms. While Descartes doubts the ability of the senses to provide us with accurate information, Bacon doubts the ability of the mind to deduce truths by itself as it is subjected to so many intellectual obfuscations, Bacon's \\"Idols.\\" In his first aphorism of New organum, Bacon states: \\"Man, the servant and interpreter of nature, does and understands only as much as he has observed, by fact or mental activity, concerning the order of nature; beyond that he has neither knowledge nor power.\\" So, in a basic sense the central difference between the philosophical methods of Descartes and those of Bacon can be reduced to an argument between deductive and inductive reasoning and whether to trust or doubt the senses. However, there is another profound difference between the two thinkers' positions on the accessibility of Truth. Descartes professed to be aiming at absolute Truth. It is questionable whether Bacon believed such a Truth can be achieved. In his opening remarks, he proposes \\"to establish progressive stages of certainty.\\" For Bacon, a measure of truth was its power to allow predictions of natural phenomena (although Bacon's forms come close to what we might call \\"Truth,\\" because they are universal, immutable laws of nature). Original contributions An interesting characteristic of Bacon's apparently scientific tract was that, although he amassed an overwhelming body of empirical data, he did not make any original discoveries. Indeed, that was never his intention, and such an evaluation of Bacon's legacy may wrongfully lead to an unjust comparison with Newton. Bacon never claimed to have brilliantly revealed new unshakable truths about nature‚Äîin fact, he believed that such an endeavour is not the work of single minds but that of whole generations by gradual degrees toward reliable knowledge. In many ways, Bacon's contribution to the advancement of human knowledge lies not in the fruit of his scientific research but in the reinterpretation of the methods of natural philosophy. His innovation is summarised in The Oxford Francis Bacon: > Before Bacon where else does one find a meticulously articulated view of > natural philosophy as an enterprise of instruments and experiment, and > enterprise designed to restrain discursive reason and make good the defects > of the senses? Where else in the literature before Bacon does one come > across a stripped-down natural-historical programme of such enormous scope > and scrupulous precision, and designed to serve as the basis for a complete > reconstruction of human knowledge which would generate new, vastly > productive sciences through a form of eliminative induction supported by > various other procedures including deduction? Where else does one find a > concept of scientific research which implies an institutional framework of > such proportions that it required generations of permanent state funding to > sustain it? And all this accompanied by a thorough, searching, and > devastating attack on ancient and not-so-ancient philosophies, and by a > provisional natural philosophy anticipating the results of the new > philosophy?\\"  References External links * * include Spedding, Devey and Wood translations *\\"Francis Bacon\\" at Early Modern Texts, with English translation The New Organon, prepared by Jonathan Bennett with adjustments to make the text more accessible *New Organon, English translation, based on the 1863 translation of James Spedding, Robert Leslie Ellis, and Douglas Denon Heath *Novum Organum (English), Thomas Fowler (ed., notes, etc.) McMillan and Co., Clarendon Press, Oxford (1878), public domain *Novum Organum, original Latin text * Category:History of scientific method Category:History of logic Category:Works by Francis Bacon (philosopher) Category:Logic books Category:1620 books Category:Philosophy of science literature ","title":"Novum Organum"},{"id":"1625309","text":"Yao Zongxun (Simplified Chinese: ÂßöÂÆóÂãã; Traditional Chinese: ÂßöÂÆóÂãõ; Pinyin: Y√°o Z≈çngx≈´n; 1917‚Äì1985) was the formal successor of Wang Xiangzhai, founder of the martial art Yiquan.

Mount. Palliative Care Service: Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, Quebec. 1980. p. 172. Brompton's cocktail is now considered obsolete.Brompton's Cocktail, Hospice Education Institute History The original idea for an oral mixture of morphine and cocaine helping patients in agony with advanced disease is credited to surgeon Herbert Snow in 1896. The Brompton cocktail is named after the Royal Brompton Hospital in London, England, where the formulation of this mixture was standardized in the late 1920s for patients with cancer. While its use has been rare in the 21st century, it is not entirely unheard of today. It was far more common in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Variants Some specifications for variants of Brompton cocktail call for methadone, hydromorphone, diamorphine (heroin), or other strong opioids in the place of morphine; diphenhydramine or tincture of cannabis in place of the chlorpromazine; and methamphetamine, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, co- phenylcaine (lidocaine and phenylephrine hydrochloride), methylphenidate, or other stimulants in the place of cocaine. The original recipe for Brompton cocktail also calls for chloroform, cherry syrup to help mask the bitter taste of some of the components, and distilled water in some quantity to dilute the chloroform (hence, chloroform water) or to add volume to allow for more precise titration of doses. Synergy among constituents While each of the ingredients combats pain or other problems that occur with it in those who may be nauseated from effects of chemotherapy, radiation or high and escalating doses of morphine (which can also cause somnolence or sleepiness, necessitating the stimulant), it is also anecdotally acknowledged that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, with the various active ingredients all potentiating the morphine or other opioid in their own ways. The synergy between opioid analgesics and centrally-acting stimulants is widely reported and commonly used: for example, the caffeine content of many codeine-based pain relievers, and prescription of dextroamphetamine or methylphenidate to patients on high doses of opioids both to combat somnolence from the painkillers and to boost their pain-killing ability. However, a 1979 study in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found no statistically significant advantage in pain suppression, confusion, nausea or drowsiness in the Brompton mixture versus a solution of morphine alone.

According to B. Raman, Jaish-e-Mohammed is viewed as the \\"deadliest\\" and \\"the principal Islamic Jihadis organisation in Jammu and Kashmir\\".

Praveen Swami, How significant is Jaish-e- Muhammad in Kashmir today?, The Indian Express, 10 November 2017. The group has been designated as a Mujahideen organisation by Pakistan, Russia, Australia, Canada, India, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the United Nations. In 2016, Jaish was suspected of being responsible for an attack on the Pathankot airbase in India. The Indian government, and some other sources, accused Pakistan of assisting Jaish in conducting the attack. Pakistan denied assisting Jaish, and arrested several members of Jaish in connection with the attack, who were then released by the security establishment according to a report in Dawn. Pakistan called the report a \\"fabrication\\". Pakistan: Cyril Almeida of Dawn 'on Exit Control List', Al Jazeera, 11 October 2016. In February 2019, the group took responsibility for a suicide bombing attack on a security convoy in the Pulwama district that killed over 40 security personnel, named as one of the largest attacks in recent years. Origins Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) is said to have created Jaish-e-Mohammed by working with several Deobandi Islamic Jihadis associated with Harkat-ul-Mujahideen.C. Christine Fair, Bringing back the Dead: Why Pakistan Used the Jaishe-Mohammad to Attack an Indian Airbase, Huffington Post, 12 January 2016. By the late 1990s, states Ahmed Rashid, the Pakistani military justified jihad in Kashmir as a legitimate part of its foreign policy. Harkat had been set up in mid-1990s with ISI support to carry out \\"spectacular acts of terrorism\\". The United States declared it an Islamic Jihadis group in 1998 and bombed its training camps in Afghanistan. In December 1999, Harkat Islamic Jihadis hijacked the Indian Airlines Flight 814 scheduled to fly from Kathmandu to Delhi, and diverted it to Kandahar, where they were looked after by the Afghan Taliban and the Pakistani officials stationed at the airport. After they slit the throat of a passenger, the Indian government agreed to their demands and released Maulana Masood Azhar, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, three Harkat operatives previously imprisoned in India. The released prisoners were escorted to Pakistan by the ISI, and Masood Azhar was chosen to head the new group Jaish-e-Mohammed. The ISI is said to have paraded him on a victory tour through Pakistan to raise money for the new organisation. Some analysts argue that ISI built up the JeM to counter the growing power of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Many analysts believed that around 1999, Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) used JeM to fight in Kashmir and other places, and continues to provide it backing. Although the JeM has been officially banned in Pakistan since 2002, it continues to openly operate several facilities in the country. Azhar's leadership is said to be nominal. The group has a largely decentralised structure. JeM's membership, drawn from the former members of Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, was allied to the Taliban in Afghanistan and Al Qaeda. The members had shared the Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan and carried loyalty to Al Qaeda. A majority of the members of Harkat are said to have followed Azhar into the newly founded group, leaving Harkat under-funded and under-supported. History2000‚Äì2001= On 20 April 2000, JeM carried out the first suicide bombing in Kashmir, exploding a bomb in an Indian army barracks. Five Indian soldiers were killed. Following the September 11 attacks in New York, the Musharraf government joined the United States in the War on Terror, assuming that the move would give it a free hand in supporting militancy in Kashmir. In October 2001, JeM carried out a bombing near the Jammu and Kashmir legislative assembly, killing 38 people and claiming responsibility for it.Militants attack Kashmir assembly, BBC News, 1 October 2001 In December 2001, JeM and LeT militants launched a fidayeen attack on the Indian Parliament waging a battle with the security personnel. Eight security personnel and a gardener were killed, but the attack was foiled. JeM claimed responsibility for the attack, but removed the announcement a day later under pressure from the ISI. The Indian Government accused the LeT and JeM of being involved in the attack. Subsequently, four JeM members were caught by Indian authorities and put on trial. All four were found guilty of playing various roles in the incident. One of the accused, Afzal Guru, was sentenced to death.4 convicted in attack . The Hindu, 17 December 2002, Retrieved 8 September 2011. Security specialist Bruce Riedel comments that even by the standards of modern terrorism, this was an extraordinary attack. If the Prime Minister or a senior party leader of India was killed in the attack, India would have been forced to retaliate militarily. In the event, India called the terror attack an \\"attack on democracy\\" and began large-scale troop mobilisation at the India-Pakistan border, launching the largest war games in fifteen years. Pakistan retaliated by launching its own war games, moving troops from the Afghan border to the Indian border. The United States, annoyed with the dilution of the War on Terror as well as the threat of an Indo-Pakistani war, delivered an ultimatum to Musharraf, asking him to make \\"a clear statement to the world that he intends to crack down on terror\\". Pushed to a corner, Musharraf announced on 12 January 2002 that no organisation would be allowed to indulge in terrorism in the name of Kashmir. He declared a ban on five extremist groups including the JeM. Hundreds of militants were rounded up, states Ahmed Rashid, giving rise to severe hostility and derision from them. However, by March 2002, all the arrested militants were freed and curbs on them were quietly lifted. Financial and intelligence inputs to JeM were resumed. Masood Azhar was released under a court order. =Bans, revolts and split= Earlier in 2001, when the group anticipated that the US State Department would declare it a foreign Islamic Jihadis organisation, it renamed itself Tehrik-ul-Furqan and transferred its assets to low-profile supporters. JeM was declared a foreign Islamic Jihadis organisation by the United Nations in October 2001 and by the US in December 2001. In response to the January 2002 ban by Pakistan, JeM changed its name to Khuddam ul-Islam. Khuddam was also banned in 2003, after which it re-branded itself as a charity called Al-Rehmat Trust. By this time, the JeM had split into two groups, due to conflicts among the members. Three JeM commanders, Abdul Jabbar, Maulana Umar Farooq and Abdullah Shah Mazhar, left the group and formed Jamaat ul-Furqan. The remaining group that stayed with Masood Azhar used the name Khuddam ul-Islam. The rank and file of the JeM were angered by Musharraf's U-turn in joining the War on Terror. By staying loyal to the Pakistani state, Masood Azhar lost majority support in the JeM Supreme Council, who demanded his resignation. Particularly influential among the rebels was Maulana Abdul Jabbar, whose faction led a jihad against what they called the \\"slave\\" government of Pakistan and the US influence upon it. They were supported by Al Qaeda, and joined by members of Lashkar-e-Taiba, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Harkatul Mujahideen. From March to September 2002, the rebels carried out suicide missions on Pakistani officials in cities like Islamabad, Karachi, Murree, Taxila and Bahawalpur. After the fall of the Taliban government, the JeM activists returning from Afghanistan attacked Christian temples, Shia mosques and diplomatic missions inside Pakistan. The ISI demanded Masood Azhar to rein in the rank-and-file. However he had lost control over them. He maintained that they were already expelled from the organisation and the state should arrest them. In fact, most of the factions remained within the JeM and competed with the parent organisation for authority and resources. Some rebellious factions gathered around Abdul Jabbar who launched Jamaat-ul-Furqan in late 2002. The rebel factions were supported by \\"rogue\\" members of the ISI. In November 2003, the Musharraf government banned the renamed Khuddam ul-Islam as well as Jamaat-ul-Furqan. Then the rebels carried out two assassination attempts on President Musharraf himself, on 14 December and 25 December 2003. There was evidence of Pakistan military members providing logistical support for the attempts. The explosives used in the bombings were traced to an Al Qaeda camp in South Waziristan. Masood Azhar too had publicly called for the assassination of Musharraf. Eventually, the government cracked down on the rogue elements in the military and intelligence establishments. More than a hundred members were apprehended and dismissed, with some members being sentenced to death. However, the majority of the militant infrastructure was left intact. Azhar's group, which had fallen into relative obscurity by 2004, was allowed to rebuild itself after the problematic portions of the leadership were purged. The rebellious factions eventually realigned themselves with Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (Pakistani Taliban) in 2007. =Revival= Masood Azhar stayed loyal to the Pakistani state after 2004. Pakistan in turn protected his group despite the official bans. The group continued to grow in Bahawalpur. In 2009, it was reported to have built a large 6.5 acre walled complex in Bahawalpur, along with a swimming pool and a stable for a dozen horses, which could be used for training militants. India Today later revealed that the complex has been branded as 'Jamia Masjid Subhan Allah' and that it was 8 km. away from the headquarters of Pakistan Army's 31 Corps.JeM chief gets Osama-style protection: India Today zeroes in on Jaish den in Pakistan, India Today, 16 February 2019. In the centre of the city, the group runs an \\"imposing\\" madrassa, attended by hundreds of children every year. In 2008, the organisation held a massive three-day rally in the city, with its own armed security guards posted at all the entrances to the city centre. The police were conspicuous by their absence. Masood Azhar kept a low profile for several years until he resurfaced in 2014, giving fiery speeches calling for more attacks on India and the United States. He boasted of having 300 suicide attackers at his command and threatened to kill Narendra Modi if he were to become the Prime Minister. Bruce Riedel connects the revival of JeM to the return to office of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who had long advocated a 'd√©tente' with India. The developing links between him and the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, especially following the latter's visit to Lahore on the Christmas Day in 2015, angered the group. =2016= A week after Narendra Modi's visit, in January 2016, the group launched an attack on the Pathankot air base in which seven security personnel were killed. This was immediately followed by an attack on the Indian consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif in Afghanistan. Both India and Pakistan condemned the attack and stayed on course with their peace process. Pakistan has also followed on the leads provided by India and carried out raids on the offices of JeM. It announced the formation of a joint investigation team with India to investigate the attack. It was also announced that Masood Azhar was taken into \\"protective custody\\". However, JeM issued a statement denying that anybody had been arrested. In April 2016, the JeM chief Masood Azhar was said to be free but \\"within reach, if needed\\". According to Riaz Hussain Pirzada, the Member of National Assembly from Bahawalpur, the \\"breeding grounds\\" still remained and the madrassas were still being financed. JeM‚Äôs Azhar lives freely in Pakistan, govt never detained him: Report, Hindustan Times, 26 April 2016. According to an official, Nawaz Sharif ordered the Counterterrorism Department to crack down on the organisation but, in a high-level meeting, the army chief General Raheel Sharif pressured the Prime Minister to hand over the crackdown to the Army, after which \\"no one knows what happened\\". Dawn reported the Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif as saying that, whenever civilian authorities took action against certain groups, the security establishment worked behind the scenes to set them free. The government however denied the accuracy of the report. Following the onset of the 2016 Kashmir unrest in Indian Jammu and Kashmir, all the jihadi groups in Pakistan held rallies in major cities like Lahore. The JeM was seen openly raising funds for jihad. In September 2016, jihadi militants attacked the Indian brigade headquarters in Uri, close to the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. The attack resulted in the death of 19 soldiers, described as the deadliest attack in over two decades. India suspected JeM for the attack. It also made its feelings felt with heavy rhetoric, the Indian Home Minister calling Pakistan a \\"Islamic Jihadis state\\" and noting that the perpetrators were \\"highly trained, heavily armed, and specially equipped\\". Pakistan denied involvement. India then launched a diplomatic offensive, trying to isolate Pakistan in the world community. On 28 September, it declared that it carried out \\"surgical strikes\\" on Islamic Jihadis launchpads in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. The claim was however denied by Pakistan. =2019= On 14 February 2019, Jaish-e-Mohammed carried out and claimed responsibility for a suicide attack in Lathpora near Awantipora in Pulwama District in Kashmir on a convoy of security forces that killed at least 40 Indian personnel. A bus carrying 39 Central Reserve Police Force personnel was rammed by a car carrying 350 kg of explosives. On 26 February 2019, 12 Indian Air Force Mirage 2000 jets crossed the Line of Control, and dropped precision-guided bombs on an alleged Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp in Balakot, a town in the Khyber province of Pakistan.https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pakistan-says-iaf-violated-line-of- control-1999288https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/26/pakistan-india- jets-breached-ceasefire-line-kashmir-bomb Pakistani Government denied that any damage was caused by the bombs.https://www.bbc.com/news/world- asia-47412884https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/01/pakistan-hands- back-indian-pilot-shot-down-over-kashmir-in-peace-gesture on 27 August 2019, two members of a nomadic community were killed by Jaish-e-Mohammed Islamic Jihadis in the higher reaches of Tral in south Kashmir after they were abducted from their temporary shelter last week.Two nomads abducted, killed in suspected militant attack in Kashmir‚Äôs Tral Ideology and goals The declared objective of the JeM is to liberate Kashmir and merge it with Pakistan. However, it projects Kashmir as a \\"gateway\\" to the entire India, whose Muslims are also deemed to be in need of liberation. After liberating Kashmir, it aims to carry its jihad to other parts of India, with an intent to drive Hindus and other non-Muslims from the Indian subcontinent. JeM also aims to drive the United States and Western forces from Afghanistan. The JeM leader Masood Azhar is reported to have said in a speech in Karachi: In late 2002, Christians were targeted across Pakistan and the gunmen belonging to JeM were caught for the acts. Some members have attacked members of the Pakistani state and western targets inside Pakistan. The American journalist Daniel Pearl was abducted and murdered by Ahmed Omar Sheikh. OrganisationLeadership= JeM's founder and leader (emir) is Maulana Masood Azhar, who had earlier been a leader of Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. Having trained at the same religious seminary (Jamia Uloom-ul-Islamia in Karachi) as the Taliban founder Mullah Omar, he had long-standing connections to Taliban and Al Qaeda. He had fought in Afghanistan and set up Harkat affiliates in Chechnya, Central Asia and Somalia. He was reputed to have taught the Somalis how to shoot down American Black Hawk helicopters. He was regarded as a close associate of Osama bin Laden, when he was sent to Britain for fund raising in the early 1990s. In 1994 Azhar went to Indian-administered Kashmir on a \\"mission\\" and got arrested by Indian security forces. Reportedly, Osama bin Laden wanted Azhar freed and ordered Al Qaeda to arrange the hijacking that led to his release. Subsequently, Azhar was lionized in Pakistan and promoted by the ISI as the leader of the new group Jaish-e-Mohammed. Azhar was specially designated as a \\"global Islamic Jihadis\\" by the US Treasury Department in 2010. JeM is run by Azhar's family like a family enterprise. Masood Azhar's brother, Abdul Rauf Asghar, is a senior leader of JeM and its intelligence coordinator. He was one of the hijackers of the flight IC 814 and served as the \\"acting leader\\" of JeM in Masood Azhar's absence in 2007. Since 2008, he has been involved with organising suicide attacks in India, including the 2016 Pathankot attack, where he was found to have directed the Islamic Jihadis via telephone. Abdul Rauf Asghar has also been designated as a \\"global Islamic Jihadis\\" by the US Treasury department. India giving 'final touches' to its UNSC proposal on Masood Azhar, The Hindu, 1 October 2016. =Membership= The launch of JeM in Karachi in 2000 was attended by 10,000 armed followers. The majority of the early membership was drawn Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. Having fought in Afghanistan alongside the Taliban and Al Qaeda, these members carried loyalty to those organisations and enmity towards the United States. Approximately three- quarters of JeM's membership is drawn from Punjab in Pakistan, from Multan, Bahawalpur and Rahim Yar Khan districts. This region being the main ethnic origin of the Pakistani military corps, ISI believed that the shared ethnicity would make the JeM aligned to the military's strategic goals. There are also a large number of Afghans and Arabs. Several western militants of Pakistani origin have also joined the organisation. Prominent among them are Rashid Rauf, who was involved with a 2006 plot to blow up transatlantic airliners, Shehzad Tanweer, who was involved with the 2005 London Underground bombings, and Ahmed Omar Sheikh, convicted of murdering Daniel Pearl. Following the split in 2002, the majority of the original fighters left the parent organisation and joined renegade groups. When the organisation was revived by 2009, JeM was believed to have between one and two thousand fighters and several thousand supporting personnel. Masood Azhar claimed having 300 suicide attackers at his command. =Infrastructure= JeM originally operated training camps in Afghanistan, jointly with the other militant groups. After the fall of the Taliban government, it relocated them to Balakot and Peshawar in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. By 2009, it developed a new headquarters in Bahawalpur in Pakistani Punjab, 420 miles south of Islamabad. These include a madrassa in the centre of the city and a 6.5 acre walled complex that serves as a training facility, including water training and horse back riding. Bahawalpur also serves as a rest and recuperation facility for jihadists fighting in Afghanistan, away from the areas of US drone attacks. It is also close to the bases of other militant groups with which JeM is believed to have operational ties: Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke, Sipah-e-Sahaba in Gojra, and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi also based in Punjab. There are at least 500‚Äì1000 other madrassas in Bahawalpur, most of which teach a violent version of Islam to children. =Publications= Like other jihadi outfits in the country, JeM distills its ideology through the print media, its publications including the weekly Al-Qalam in Urdu and English, monthly Ayeshatul Binat in Urdu for women and weekly Musalman Bachy for children.Muhammad Amir Rana, \\"Jihadi Print Media in Pakistan: An Overview\\" in Conflict and Peace Studies, vol. 1, no. 1 (Oct-Dec 2008), p. 3 =Links to other organisations= When JeM started, it had strong ties to the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, sharing their training camps in Afghanistan, and exchanging intelligence, training and coordination. Bruce Riedel suggests that the 2001 Indian Parliament attack was possibly a \\"payback\\" to Al-Qaeda for its earlier help in getting Masood Azhar released. With the Indian reaction to the attack, Pakistan was forced to move its forces from the Afghan border to the Indian border, relieving pressure on Al-Qaeda. Most of the JeM members with loyalties to the Taliban left to join renegade groups in 2002. However, Masood Azhar's group was noticed recruiting fighters for the Afghan jihad in 2008. In 2010, Pakistan's Interior minister Rehman Malik stated that the JeM, along with Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan, were allied to the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. Within South Punjab, the JeM is closely allied to Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-e-Sahaba. Scholars Abou Zahab and Roy state that the three organisations appear to be \\"the same party\\" focusing on different sectors of activity. JeM continues to have links to its ancestor, Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. In addition, the group has operational ties to Lashkar-e-Taiba, which it employed in launching the 2001 Indian Parliament attack. It joined the ISI- sponsored United Jihad Council, an umbrella organisation of 13‚Äì16 militant organisations that fight in Indian-administered Kashmir. Khuddam ul-Islam is a militant splinter group of the Jaish-e-Mohammed. It is a Proscribed Organisation in the United Kingdom under the Terrorism Act 2000 and said to be politically aligned with Maulana Fazal-ur-Rehman's faction of Jamiat Ulema-e- Islam. Some sources believe that Khuddam ul-Islam is simply a restructuring of JeM and that the group is under the command of Mufti Abdul Rauf Asghar, the younger brother of JeM's founder, Maulana Masood Azhar.

The Dayton Art Institute has been rated one of the top 10 best art museums in the United States for children. The museum also ranks in the top 3% of all art museums in North America in 3 of 4 factors. In 2007, the art institute saw 303,834 visitors. History Founded in a downtown mansion in 1919 as the Dayton Museum of Fine Arts, the museum moved to a newly designed Edward B. Green building in 1930. The DAI was modeled after the Casino in the gardens of the Villa Farnese at Caprarola, and the front hillside stairway after the Italian Renaissance garden stairs at the Villa d'Este, near Rome, and Italy. It is also visible from and easily accessible from I-75, which passes through the center of Dayton. The museum was later renamed the Dayton Art Institute as an indication of the growing importance of its school in addition to the museum. The nearly building is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Museum information The museum's collection contains more than 20,000 objects spanning 5,000 years. In September, 2005, the Museum became one of eleven galleries in the US to host The Quest for Immortality: Treasures of Ancient Egypt, the largest collection of ancient artifacts ever to travel outside Egypt. The art museum is an Italian Renaissance‚Äìstyle building, which sits atop a hill overlooking downtown Dayton.

It spans the River Cleddau between Neyland and Pembroke Dock, South Wales. Errors in the box girder design caused it to collapse during its construction in 1970. The bridge became operational during 1975. The bridge is managed by Pembrokeshire County Council. Cleddau Bridge viewed from Neyland History Pembrokeshire is divided by the Cleddau; Hobbs Point in Pembroke Dock on the south side and Neyland on the north side are less than apart across the waterway but a journey of by road is required to travel from one to the other. Between 1858 and 1950, the Admiralty permitted operation of steam ferries between the two towns. From 1950, the County Council operated a ferry service, with capacity for 24 vehicles and 250 pedestrians. A decision was taken in the 1960s to replace the ferry service: two bridges would be required, one crossing the Cleddau and a smaller bridge to the north of Neyland crossing Westfield Pill creek. Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners and Freeman Fox and Partners (now part of Hyder Consulting) were appointed as joint consulting engineers and the contract to build the bridge was awarded to A.E. Farr Limited in September 1968 for ¬£2.1 million. The project was expected to be completed by March 1971 but on 2 June 1970 a cantilever being used to put one of the 150-tonne sections into position collapsed on the south side of the estuary. Four workers died and five were injured. Construction was halted until October 1972. The Merrison Committee of Inquiry into the Design and Erection of Steel Box Girder Bridges concluded that the cause of the collapse was the inadequacy of the design of a pier support diaphragm (a diaphragm of half the designed thickness was used), but considered \\"the failure of site organisation between the parties as of more general significance\\". The committee believed that the only relevant Code of Practice relating to the design of steel bridges in the UK was inadequate for applications such as the Cleddau Bridge, and they implemented Interim Design and Workmanship Rules. These rules laid the groundwork for a new British Standard covering box girder bridge design. , the collapse during construction is the last major bridge disaster in the UK. The final cost of construction was ¬£11.83 million and the bridge was opened to traffic on 20 March 1975. The ¬£7 million of overspend was attributed to design changes made due to the Merrison Committee's recommendations. This was covered by a ¬£3 million out-of- court settlement between the County Council and the consulting engineers and a ¬£4 million interest-free loan from the Government that was repayable over 40 years. 885,900 crossings were made during the bridge's first year in operation. The ferry service between Hobbs Point and Neyland ceased when the construction of the Cleddau Bridge was completed in 1975. The ferry Cleddau King was sold, modified by Harland and Wolff of Belfast and put into operation as a reserve Portaferry‚ÄìStrangford ferry in Northern Ireland. Formerly, tolls were collected on the south side of the bridge from traffic travelling in both directions. Toll booths with barriers were introduced in September 2004 to reduce the number of vehicles driving through without paying. The bridge has been toll-free since 28 March 2019. Closures The county council may close the bridge depending on wind speed, wind direction and the weather forecast. Vehicles taller than , bicycles and motorcycles are usually not permitted to cross the bridge when wind speeds exceed . The bridge is closed to all vehicles and pedestrians should wind speeds exceed . The council records the time the bridge is closed. Memorial A memorial plaque to the four men who died in the bridge collapse was unveiled on the 25th anniversary of the disaster in 1995, but was reported stolen in 2017.

Some suits are specifically made for snowboarders but most are used by either skiers or snowboarders regardless of the style. Design A ski suit can either be one-piece, in the form of a jumpsuit, or two-piece, in the form of a ski jacket and matching trousers, called salopettes or ski pants.Alibaba Group Internet showrooms for ski suit and for snowsuit A ski suit is made from wind- and water-resistant or waterproof fabric, and has a non-removable liner made of nylon, silk, cotton or taffeta. Its main function is to keep a person warm while participating in winter sports, especially Nordic (cross-country) or Alpine (down-hill) skiing. It is generally a unisex garment. A ski suit is meant to be worn with a base layer, which consists of long johns and a warm shirt, usually designed for skiing. Ski suits are often made of Gore-Tex or similar materials. They are often in the form of a shell suit, to which the skier adds more or less warm underwear depending on the weather. Pockets are usually made to be waterproof, so items put in them can stay dry. =One-piece ski suits= A one-piece ski suit is sometimes called a \\"freedom suit\\". It covers the whole torso, arms and legs. They usually have one or sometimes two zippers down the front of the suit, sometimes additionally closed by a flap with velcro or buttons, and often have a belt at the waist. Sometimes, the suit has built-in suspenders on the inside for added support. One-piece ski suits are often just made as a shell layer, with the skier adding warm underwear of own choice adapted to the current weather situation. Other suits may be padded for warmth, but when intended for skiing they are still not as insulated as a snowmobile suit. A new style of soft-shell ski suit has become popular in the 2000s. Considered a smarter and more stylish option, with more stretch, warmth and comfort than hardshell fabrics offer whilst maintaining a high level of water resistance, wind resistance and breathability, these new suits are insulated with a fleece backing, avoiding the bulk of down filled snow suits, but still allowing room for layering. They also tend to be more affordable than hardshell GORE-TEX¬Æ suits.https://www.red7skiwear.com/blogs/news/review-snowboarders-top-gear- cool-of-the-wildhttps://www.red7skiwear.com/blogs/news/why-one-piece-ski- suits-are-back-in-style The first one-piece ski suit is said to have been designed by Italian Olympic skier and fashion designer Emilio Pucci in the late 1940s.The history of the one piece ski suit =Ski jacket= A ski jacket covers the arms and torso, sometimes just to the waist while other times reaching down over the buttocks. It can be a separate item or part of a two- piece ski suit together with matching ski pants. From the introduction of ski jackets in the middle to late 1950s through the early 1980s, the dominant style was for a ski jacket to resemble a safari jacket in having a similar belt and shirt-like collar. A similar jacket, especially one with a hood, may also be called a parka, anorak, down jacket or winter shell. =Ski pants= Ski pants, also called salopettes, when part of a two-piece ski suit, are usually made in the same fabric and color as the corresponding ski jacket. It is sometimes in the form of bib-and-brace and the jacket is worn over it. = Race suits = Often referred to as race suits or speed suits, these are the suits worn by professional and junior racers at competitions to improve their speed. They are mostly made as one-piece suits. Made mostly of Polyurethane (85-90%) and Polyester (15-10%), these suits can reduce wind resistance by as much as fifty percent. Since wind resistance accounts for ninety five percent of the force stopping skiers from going faster, wearing one of these suits can potentially give you nearly double the speed. They are very tight and form hugging and can take a while to adapt to the body. Olympic athletes can reach over 160 km/h in a race suit, while even a junior racer may struggle to get past 80 km/h without one. Suit costs range from $210 for a beginners suit to $1,200 for the suits generally worn by Olympic athletes. Ski suits of this kind are not unisex garments due to the need to be skin tight and must be sized properly to be effective. Most athletes wear a base layer beneath their suit, but some may wear only the suit on race days, as the base layer will decrease the efficiency of the suit slightly. Snowsuit events In North America, there are many charity networks working with providing less fortunate children with snowsuits for the winter.The Snowsuit Effort in Detroit and The Snowsuit Fund in Ottawa are examples of this. Ski suits and snow suits are a natural part of some sporting events. There are also some events which emphasize the use of the snowsuit as such.

After his father's murder in 1607, Peter and his mother sought refuge in Ruthenian Voivodeship, part of Lesser Poland. For a time, they lived in Kamianets-Podilskyi, but in 1608 they moved to Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski's castle, where they stayed for sixteen years.–£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ –ø–µ–¥–∞–≥–æ–≥—ñ–∫–∞ –≤ –ø–µ—Ä—Å–æ–Ω–∞–ª—ñ—è—Ö ‚Äì –•–Ü–• —Å—Ç–æ–ª—ñ—Ç—Ç—è / –ó–∞ —Ä–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ü—ñ—î—é –û.–í. –°—É—Ö–æ–º–ª–∏–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ—ó / –Ω–∞–≤—á–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–π –ø–æ—Å—ñ–±–Ω–∏–∫ –¥–ª—è —Å—Ç—É–¥–µ–Ω—Ç—ñ–≤ –≤–∏—â–∏—Ö –Ω–∞–≤—á–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏—Ö –∑–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥—ñ–≤, —É –¥–≤–æ—Ö –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞—Ö// ¬´–õ–∏–±—ñ–¥—å¬ª, - –ö., 2005, –∫–Ω. 1. There he started his formal schooling, which, prior to the arrival to the castle, was often interrupted by frequent moves. Peter‚Äôs teachers were monks from the Lviv brotherhood (see Bratstvo) and later, he continued his studies of classical literature in Latin, Greek, Polish, Old Slavic and Old Belorussian languages at the Academy in Zamo≈õƒá, founded in 1594 by Polish Crown Chancellor Jan Zamoyski. Later Mogila continued his studies in Paris. Career Ukrainian stamp Moldovan stamp In the 1620s, Mogila traveled to Ukraine which at that time was in a political turmoil due to internal and external factors, in part due to Poland‚Äôs annexation of Ukrainian lands. He started preparing spiritually at his aristocratic home in Rubiejovka, where he also founded a church dedicated to Saint John the New from Suceava. He then settled in Kyevo- Pechers‚Äôka Lavra in Kiev (Kiev Pechersk Lavra), which was the political, cultural, spiritual, and educational center of Ukraine. There he joined Job Boretsky, Zacharias Kopystensky, and Pamvo Berynda, and a group of scholars and orthodox clerics who promoted ideas of national liberation and cultural self-preservation. The effects of political instability affected all spheres of life in the country. The number of printed publications was significantly reduced and many schools were closed. In order to preserve their privileges before the Polish king, the nobility, in great numbers, started to convert from Orthodoxy to Greek and Roman Catholicism. The Romanians from Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania belonged to the Eastern Orthodox Church, and Old Church Slavonic was used, until the 17th century, as the common liturgical language in Romanian principalities. In 1632 Mogila became the bishop of Kiev and abbot of Pecherska Lavra. Because of his ties to several European royal homes, the leadership of the Orthodox clergy entrusted him to negotiate with the Polish Sejm (parliament) and the king to lift the repressive laws against the Orthodox Church and to ease the restrictions on the use of the Church Slavonic language in schools and public offices. Mogila‚Äôs diplomatic talent paid off. King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV reinstated the status of the Eastern Orthodox Church in Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. The first years as abbot Mogila showed that he had far-reaching goals to reform not only the monastic life at the Lavra and the Church. He wanted to strengthen the Orthodox spirituality and enhance the sense of national identity as well as raise the educational level in the country and in all Russian and Romanian lands to equal that in Western Europe. One of the first steps in implementing this vision, Mogila founded at the Lavra a school for young monks (1632). The tutoring was conducted in Latin. The students studied theology, philosophy, rhetoric, and classical authors. At the same time, Mogila significantly improved the print shop at the Lavra where Orthodox books were published not only in Old Slavic but in Latin as well and distributed to various places in eastern Europe. Later that year, Mogila merged this school with the Kiev Brotherhood school and created the Mogila collegium which later became known as the Kiev Mogila Academy (National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy). The students at the collegium had diverse backgrounds. They came from noble, clerical, gentry, Cossack and peasant families. The school offered a variety of disciplines: Church Slavonic, Latin, Greek, and Polish languages; philosophy; mathematics, including geometry, astronomy, music and history. Because of the high profile of the faculty, the collegium received the status of a higher educational establishment. In the next few years, Mogila established a whole network of schools around Ukraine as well as the Slavonic-Greek-Latin Academy in Vinnytsia and collegium in Kremenets. Also, he supplied the prince of Wallachia, Matei Basarab, upon his request, with a printing press and printers. In 1635 the prayer books which were published in Prince Basarab‚Äôs monastic residence were widely distributed in Wallachia, (later to become Romania), and Ukraine. He helped to establish the school in Ia»ôi in Moldova as well. Printing Dormition Church in Lviv, known as the \\"Romanian (\\"Wallachian\\") Church\\". Trebnik published by Peter Mohy≈Ça Great catechism by Peter Mohy≈Ça \\"Arctos of the Russian heaven...\\" (mentioning of Collegia of Kijouo Mohilaeni)For over 20 years, Mogila played a leading role in Ukraine‚Äôs book printing. He was one of the first to print in the Ukrainian language. Mohyla and his followers at the Lavra and the Mohyla collegium made the first steps in formulating the fundamentals of the modern Russian and Ukrainian languages. The proliferation of the Ukrainian language in print was part of a wider effort of Ukraine‚Äôs struggle for sovereignty and cultural self- preservation. Mohyla wanted to preserve the Ukrainian nation‚Äôs identity that had been experiencing enormous pressure from the Polish and Lithuanian regimes. He initiated the publication of sermons for the laity in Ukrainian, Biblical texts in Church Slavonic, and scientific books in Ukrainian, Polish, Greek, and Latin. Mohyla wrote several books which were distributed in Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Muscovy, Romania, and Georgia. One of his most important publications was the first Orthodox Catholic Catechesis worldwide (1640), written by him on the request of all Orthodox Catholic churches. After it was approved by several Ecumenical Patriarchs of Constantinople it became the foundational document for the Church doctrine in the orthodox world.–£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ –ø–µ–¥–∞–≥–æ–≥—ñ–∫–∞ –≤ –ø–µ—Ä—Å–æ–Ω–∞–ª—ñ—è—Ö ‚Äì –•–Ü–• —Å—Ç–æ–ª—ñ—Ç—Ç—è / –ó–∞ —Ä–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ü—ñ—î—é –û.–í. –°—É—Ö–æ–º–ª–∏–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ—ó / –Ω–∞–≤—á–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–π –ø–æ—Å—ñ–±–Ω–∏–∫ –¥–ª—è —Å—Ç—É–¥–µ–Ω—Ç—ñ–≤ –≤–∏—â–∏—Ö –Ω–∞–≤—á–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏—Ö –∑–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥—ñ–≤, —É –¥–≤–æ—Ö –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞—Ö// ¬´–õ–∏–±—ñ–¥—å¬ª, - –ö., 2005, –∫–Ω. 1. During the 17th and 18th centuries, this book had 25 editions. His other notable works included Trebnyk or Euchologion (1646). It resembled an encyclopedia in which all Ukrainian church rites and services were systematized. In this, he did much to preserve the purity of Orthodox ritual. A decade earlier, he published his Anthologion in which he emphasized the need for teachers to find unique approaches to each student when teaching since their abilities varied. Applying the same requirements to all students may not be the most effective teaching method. Mogila stressed the need for students to ponder over and understand and not simply repeat scientific, religious, and moral truths. In this and other works, Mohyla underscored the need for the younger generation to use their minds and not emotions in striving to achieve goals. In his Triodion (1631), Mogila expressed his political views about what an ideal ruler should look like. He argued that the person has to maintain peace with the neighbors; defend his lands in the times of war; a ruler is not only obligated to issue laws but first of all he should limit his own powers. Project of a Polish nobleman of the Greek religion (1645) a Latin manuscript printed firstly in 1928 presents his \\"Project of Union\\" consisted of his own acceptance of the divine Primacy of the Roman Pontiff, while observing that the legitimate rights of the Eastern patriarchates must be respected by the West.The original manuscript was kept in the archives of the Roman Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith and published for the first time in a work by Ed. Smurlo (1928) and again by A.G. Welkyi in 1964. A French translation is provided by B. Dupuy in ISTINA (Jan-March 1990). Legacy Mogila‚Äôs innovative approach in reforming the education system by introducing Latin in the curriculum of schools and universities met some resistance when Ruthenian loyalists resorted to violent acts against teachers and educational facilities where Latin was taught. However, Mogila remained undeterred in his efforts to make the use of Latin in schools obligatory since it was an essential part in the curriculum in all European schools and universities. One of Mogila‚Äôs main arguments in favor of Latin was that students who learn it in Ukraine would have an advantage should they decide to continue their studies in other European universities, since Latin was practically the lingua franca of the scholarly world. Historic preservation was another aspect of Mogila‚Äôs multifaceted career. He initiated substantial restoration projects of key historical monuments in Kyiv and around the country. Among them was the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev. People believed that for as long the Cathedral was standing the city would be spared from destruction. Thus by restoring St. Sophia and other monuments, Mogila, on the one hand, strengthened the Ukrainian Church‚Äôs position, and on the other, his efforts were a morale booster for the whole country at a times when national unity and independence were at risk. Peter Mogila died in 1647, on the eve of the national liberation war of 1648-1654. In his testament, he instructed that all Ruthenian people be literate and all his property be given to the Mogila collegium which for nearly two centuries remained the only higher education establishment in the Orthodox world. The school became an important scientific, educational, cultural, and spiritual center of Orthodox world, especially Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. The state language of Russia was created at this Academy using the Chernihiv dialect of Ukraine as a basis. Its graduates propagated ideas of humanism and national self-determination. After the Cossack Hetmanate became part of Russia, graduates helped Nikon to introduce the Ukrainian Orthodox faith to Russians to have the common faith in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. Many of graduates pursued their careers in Western Europe but many traveled the countryside and taught in villages and towns. According to the Christian Arab scholar Paul of Aleppo, who in 1655 traveled through Ukraine to Moscow, ‚ÄúEven villagers in Ukraine can read and write ‚Ä¶and village priests consider it their duty to instruct orphans and not let them run in the streets as vagabonds.‚ÄùOrest Subtelny, Ukraine: A History, University of Toronto Press (1988). Thus Peter Mogila is credited with laying the foundation for a cultural epoch which historians call the Mogila period. One of the attributes of this epoch was book publication. Despite the political instability in Ukraine in the late 1600s, it had 13 printing presses, of which 9 were Ukrainian, 3 Polish, and 1 Jewish. The output of these presses was not only of a religious nature. For example, in 1679 the press in Novhorod-Siverski put out over 3 000 copies of various textbooks for elementary schools. This was a tremendous achievement due in part to Mohyla‚Äôs efforts to spread literacy among all social groups. Sainthood left He is venerated as a saint in the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, the Russian Orthodox Church, the Romanian Orthodox Church, and the Polish Orthodox Church. His feast day is January 1, but he is also commemorated October 5 together with the other sainted Metropolitans of Kyiv. The Greek Orthodox Church has tended to be more suspicious of Peter Mogila, some believing him to be too influenced by trends in Roman Catholic theology. The Orthodox Church in America is also suspicious of Peter Mogila, but nevertheless they list him on their website as a saint.

It was built in the 13th century by King TuitƒÅtui in honor of his two sons. The monument is sometimes called the \\"Stonehenge of the Pacific\\".  Etymology  The word haamonga means \\"a stick with loads on both ends, carried over the shoulder\\". Maui is a cultural hero in Polynesian mythology.  Description  Ha'amonga 'a Maui is constructed from three coral limestone slabs. It is 5.2m high, 1.4m wide, and 5.8m long. The weight of the visible part of each upright stone is approximately 30‚Äì40 tons. Deep mortises are cut into the top of each upright stone to fit the lintel. Near the trilithon is a stone throne called the Esi maka faakinanga (\\"stone to lean against\\"). It was believed that when the king was seated with his back against the throne, he was safe from assassins who may sneak up behind him, and with his long stick he could hit every potential foe from the front on his knees.  History  According to traditional accounts, the monument was made by the folk hero Maui, as the stones were thought to be too large for mortals to handle. Maui was supposed to have obtained the stones from Uvea Island, and carried them to Tonga in a giant canoe. Historical analysis places its creation around 1200 CE, under TuitƒÅtui, the eleventh Tui Tonga (King of Tonga) and his high chief Lo ªau, most likely as a gateway to HeketƒÅ, or the royal compound. It was built in honor of the king's two sons, who are represented by the two upright stones, and their bond represented by the lintel stone on top. The monument and its surrounding areas were declared a protected national park in 1972.  Astronomical significance  In 1967, King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV came to believe that Ha'amonga 'a Maui had an astronomical significance, telling the position of sunrise at solstices and equinoxes. This theory is supported by the research of Tongan historian Tevita Fale.Fale, Tevita H. 1990. Tongan Astronomy. Nuku‚Äòalofa, Tonga: Polynesian Eyes Foundation. According to Tevita Fale, there is a V-shaped mark on top of the lintel that aligns with the rising of the sun during the solstices and equinoxes. Kik Velt disagrees with the findings of King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV and Tevita Fale. Velt argues that the V on top is an arrow directed along the main axis of the lintel (about ESE, 117¬∞5 E of N), only 10 cm long, too short to be a reliable indicator of any direction.

She operated against American shipping between July and December 1861, taking 18 prizes, but was trapped in Gibraltar by Union warships. Decommissioned, she was sold and reverted to merchant service as Gibraltar. She successfully ran the Union blockade in 1863 and survived the war. Construction and merchant service The wood-hulled merchant steamship Habana was built in 1859 at the Philadelphia shipyard of Birely & Lynn for Captain James McConnell's New Orleans & Havana Steam Navigation Co.\\"Byerly\\" probably a mis-spelling She was powered by a 400 horsepower engine made by Neafie, Levy & Co, also of Philadelphia, driving a single propeller and was also rigged for sail, generally described as bark rigged. She was variously reported to measure 499 or 520 gross registered tons, and had dimensions , beam and depth. Habana was launched on 18 May 1859, performed well on trials and was considered a fast ship in subsequent mail service out of New Orleans. She was later rigged as a three-masted bark, and renamed Gibraltar or Gibraltar of Liverpool. Confederate States Navy A drawing of Sumter running the blockade at New Orleans The merchant steamship Habana was purchased by the Confederate Government at New Orleans in April 1861; she was converted to a cruiser and placed under the command of Raphael Semmes. Renamed Sumter, she was commissioned in the Confederate Navy on 3 June 1861 and broke through the Federal blockade of the Mississippi River mouth late in that month. Eluding the sloop-of-war which was in hot pursuit, early in July, the pioneering Confederate Navy commerce raider captured eight U.S.-flagged merchant ships in waters near Cuba, then moved to the south to Maranh√£o, Brazil coast where she took two more. Two additional merchantman fell to Sumter in September and October 1861. While coaling at Martinique in mid-November, she was blockaded by the Federal sloop of war , but was able to escape to sea at night and resume her activities. Sumter captured another six ships from late November into January 1862, while cruising from the western hemisphere to European waters. Anchoring at Cadiz on 4 January 1862, she was allowed only to make necessary repairs there, without refueling, and was forced to run for Gibraltar. Unable to obtain needed repairs, she was laid up in April and remained inactive, watched through the year by a succession of U.S. Navy warships, among them the sloop of war and gunboat . Semmes and many of her officers were reemployed in the new cruiser . On 17 October, Second Officer Hester shot Commanding officer Andrews with a revolver as Andrews was laying in his bed, killing him. Hester was arrested. A coroner's jury returned a verdict of wilful murder. Gibraltar Disarmed and sold at auction 19 December 1862 to the Fraser-Trenholm interests, Sumter quietly continued her service to the Confederacy under British colors as the blockade runner Gibraltar of Liverpool. Though her career as a warship had lasted barely six months, Sumter had taken 18 prizes, of which she burned eight, released or bonded nine; only one was recaptured. The diversion of Federal blockade ships to hunt her down had been in itself of significant service to the Confederate cause. As Gibraltar, she ran at least once into Wilmington, North Carolina, under Capt. E. C. Reid, a Southerner. He sailed from Liverpool 3 July 1863 with a pair of 22-ton Blakely guns and other particularly valuable munitions, returning with a full load of cotton. The beginning of this voyage is recorded only because the U.S. Consul at the British port passionately protested Gibraltars being allowed to sail ‚Äì ostensibly for Nassau, days before formal customs clearance: \\"She is one of the privileged class and not held down like other vessels to strict rules and made to conform to regulations.\\" The arrival at Wilmington is also accidental matter of record today because of the troop transport Sumter tragedy at Charleston the same summer, which, until November, Admiral Dahlgren's intelligence understandably confused with the former cruiser Sumter, now Gibraltar. Mr. Trenholm's son-in-law long maintained Sumter finally \\"went down in a gale near the spot where the Alabama was sunk,\\" but supplied no date; one source suggests 1867. The last official report of her seems to have been by the U.S. Consul at Liverpool, 10 July 1864: \\"The pirate Sumter (called Gibraltar) is laid up at Birkenhead.\\". Gibraltar was sold at auction at Liverpool on orders from the Consul on 14 June 1866. She sold for ¬£1,150. Her new owners were based in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire. She was employed in the Baltic trade. On 10 February 1867 she sprang a leak whilst on a voyage from Helsingborg, Sweden to Grimsby, Lincolnshire. She foundered in the Dogger Bank on 14 February. Her crew were rescued by a fishing smack.

He is most known today as the author of Findings in Hypnosis (1964). Over the course of his life, he was also well known as the creator and host of the popular radio show Hobby Lobby\\"Park River native‚Äôs hobbies brought success\\" Curtis Eriksmoen, The Forum, Sunday, February 12, 2006\\"Radio S-L-E-E-P\\" TIME, Monday, August 28, 1939Those Were the Days, the Today in History 440 International. as well as a songwriter and lyricist. allmusic.com AMG Artist ID P 332404 Early life Dave Elman was born David Kopelman to parents Jacob and Lena on May 6, 1900, in Park River, North Dakota. In 1902, the family moved to Fargo, where they started a business on Front Street making wigs, switches, and related performance equipment. In 1906, they moved their wig-making business to the Kopelman Building, which they had built at 514 1st Street. In the basement, they provided mikvah services so Jewish women in the community could purify themselves through special cleansing. Lena also began a hairdressing shop next door. Soon thereafter, Jacob was diagnosed with cancer. When a family friend relieved the intractable pain quite rapidly with hypnosis, Elman set about learning these techniques from him and began to realize the vast possibilities of hypnosis in the relief of pain outside of traditional medical procedures. Jacob died in November 1908, leaving his pregnant wife with six children. In his early teens, Elman worked odd jobs to help the family. He was a talented musician on the saxophone and violin, and used his quick wit and love of entertaining to perform within the community as a comic. Career and later life Elman's performing eventually led to the vaudeville circuit, and he moved to New York in 1922. His stage name in vaudeville was Elman, shortened from Kopelman when his billing as \\"The World's Youngest and Fastest Hypnotist\\" did not fit on marquees or promotional material. After being unsatisfied working the nightclubs, he later got a job working for music publishers. It was at this time that Dave became acquainted with the famous blues composer and musician W. C. Handy, with whom he worked for some years. The most well- known songs the duo wrote during this period were \\"Atlanta Blues\\", which was later recorded by dozens of other artists including Louis Armstrong, and \\"Oh Papa!\\", which was later recorded by Odetta. It was while working with Handy that he met his future wife, Pauline Reffe. During the years 1923-1928, Elman was anxious to break into radio. In 1928, he got his first job with WHN, a large radio station in New York City. Soon after, he was hired by Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), New York, where he became known as an idea man. He wrote, produced, directed, and performed in his own shows as well as others. He wrote a number of Kate Smith shows. In 1937, he approached NBC with an idea for a new show: \\"Ordinary people would become advocates about their unusual hobbies\\", which were to be judged by an invited celebrity. NBC approved, and, on October 6, 1937, Elman debuted Hobby Lobby. The show became popular, and thousands of letters came in each week from people who wanted to talk about their hobbies. Many celebrities also sought to be on Elman‚Äôs show. When Elman went on vacation on August 2, 1939, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt accepted the invitation to be his replacement as host. Later, when he was hospitalized for a gallbladder operation, Roosevelt was once more the interim host. She also collaborated with Dave Elman on a movie advocating the use of hobbies as activities for soldiers, which she described in her \\"My Diary\\" newspaper column. Hobby Lobby was on the air until 1948. In 1949, Elman decided to pursue teaching hypnosis to doctors and dentists. From 1949 through 1962, he traveled extensively throughout America teaching his training course in hypnosis as a series of lessons called \\"Medical Relaxation\\", which he published as audio recordings. He also recorded a series of recordings entitled \\"Hypno-Analysis\\" which were actual sessions in hypnosis that he referenced for his course. In 1963, after a long illness, he decided to write his findings on the subject. It was a 336-page book which he dictated to his wife, Pauline, a stenographer, and then gave to his son Robert Elman, an author and editor, to edit. He copyrighted and self-published the book in 1964 under the title Findings in Hypnosis. Elman died suddenly on 5 December 1967, having recovered from a heart attack five years earlier. Elman's work continues to be promoted by his son and daughter-in-law, Larry and Cheryl Elman. See also * History of hypnosis Books *1964 Findings in Hypnosis. Self-published.

The twelve-sided nickel is located on a small hill overlooking the intersection of Municipal Road 55 and Big Nickel Drive at the westernmost end of the Gatchell neighbourhood. The Big Nickel celebrated its 45th anniversary on July 22, 2009 with a \\"birthday party\\" on the grounds of Dynamic Earth, including a display of coins from Science North's Inco Coin Collection.\\"Sudbury's big nickel celebrates 45 years\\". Northern Life, July 24, 2009. Origin The Big Nickel in 2014 The idea for the Big Nickel began in 1963 when Ted Szilva, at the time a 28-year- old City of Sudbury fireman, read in the Sudbury Star of a contest, sponsored by the Sudbury Canada Centennial Committee (Maurice Lacourciere, Chairman), asking Sudbury residents how the City should celebrate the upcoming Canadian Centennial. Szilva put forward the suggestion for a major tourist attraction featuring a giant replica of a five-cent coin, an underground mine and a mining science centre. Szilva's idea was rejected because the committee felt that \\"it did not have sufficient use for the citizens of Sudbury as such\\". By this time, Szilva had independently researched his idea, and had concluded that it could indeed be a viable and worthwhile project. He began to make this dream a reality by scouting out the highest hills in Sudbury to find the best location. On December 11, 1963, he purchased of land from Walter Holdich for $1,000.00 with a $25.00 down payment. The land was ideal because of its unique location between Sudbury and Copper Cliff. To the west, the large hill provided a sensational view of the INCO mining and smelting complex, including the nightly slag dump, while to the east one had a beautiful view of the city of Sudbury. After the land was acquired, the city refused to give Szilva the building permit for the monument, or a road allowance for access to the landlocked property, so he visited the president of INCO, John Pigott, and requested a lease for of adjacent INCO land in Copper Cliff. This acquisition would ensure that Szilva would have access to his land. INCO did lease the requested land, for 99 years at $1.00 per year. Eventually he bought the leased land from INCO, in addition to another . Szilva contracted a firm to build the Big Nickel road, and Pioneer Construction paved the new road. The Big Nickel was eventually built on the crest of the hill, three feet outside of the city of Sudbury limits in Copper Cliff Ontario, which did not require a building permit. Fund raising Not yet financially secure, Szilva needed investors in order to make the dream a reality. Three men from Sudbury indicated that they would invest, but when the time came, they refused to put any money into Szilva's new company, Nickel Monument Development Ltd. Szilva eventually owned 99.9% of the shares of the company. In order to raise the money for the development of the project, Szilva had a series of commemorative coins struck which represented each of the monuments to be erected at the park. To have worldwide appeal, he conceived the idea for a numismatic park and called it the Canadian Centennial Numismatic Park. The Big Nickel would be its centrepiece. The uniqueness of this park appealed to the numismatists worldwide, who purchased the medallions in order to support the construction and development of the park. One such medallion package, mailed out to purchasers in 1964 from Nickel Monument Development contained three coins and a descriptive project brochure. Two of the coins were identical silver-dollar- sized 0.999 silver content Kennedy commemorative coins. The third was a silver dollar sized copper-coloured Kennedy commemorative coin. All three coins were identically marked on the obverse with a Kennedy profile above the words 'In God We Trust, 1964' surrounded by 'Canadian Centennial Numismatic Park, Sudbury, Canada'. On the reverse, each was marked with an eternal flame above the words 'And so let the word go forth that the torch has been lit,' and the words 'John Fitzgerald Kennedy 1917.1963'. The brochure discussed the medallions, the park ('Canada's Most Unique Tourist Attraction‚ÄîCanadian Centennial Numismatic Park'), other fundraising ideas, and planned future attractions. In December 1963 Szilva had earned enough funds through mail- order sales to proceed with the first phase of the proposed development. He chose the 1951 five-cent piece and \\"coined\\" the phrase \\"The Big Nickel\\". Artist Steve Trenka designed the 1951 five-cent piece. His rendition of a nickel refinery was not based on any actual complex, though some believed it to be the INCO refinery in Sudbury. In 1951 the INCO smelter had three stacks, not one (unlike the five-cent piece) and the Inco Superstack which supposedly appeared in the centre of the buildings, was not erected until 1971. It would seem that The Big Nickel was the cause of these rumours, because of the similarity of its design to the five-cent coin and its proximity to the INCO complex. The 1951 design was chosen for the Big Nickel since it marked the bicentennial of the chemical isolation of nickel by the Swedish chemist Baron Axel Frederic Cronstedt. This metal, of course, played a large role in the establishment of Sudbury as a mining town. Before 1751, the element now known as nickel played havoc with refiners. Thought to be an alloy of copper, German miners coined the term, \\"Kupfernickel\\" or \\"Old Nick's Copper\\". This \\"Devil's Copper\\" could not be extracted with the technology of the time. Cronstedt, however, was able to prove that the trouble refiners faced was due to an unknown element which he named nickel. Szilva ultimately chose the 1951 Canadian nickel, minted by the Royal Canadian Mint in 1951, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the isolation of nickel as a metal, to show where Sudbury's wealth came from, and to be a lasting tribute to the men and women who mined and processed the minerals in the Sudbury Basin. In short, the nickel was intended to exhibit Sudbury's pride to the whole world. Design and construction The Big Nickel site formerly also included a penny and other monuments. Bruno Cavallo, a local sign manufacturer and artist, also had an idea of constructing a five-cent coin out of chromium. He contacted Szilva, and the two proceeded with the construction of the 1951 nickel. It was to be built with stainless steel, so it would endure the harsh Sudbury elements. Cavallo spent several months forming the artistic work. The first step was to project the image of the 1951 five-cent piece against a large wall at the Sudbury Steelworkers Hall. After projecting the image, it was traced by Szilva and Cavallo over a period of two nights onto large, thick pieces of brown paper. The traced sections were then transported to Cavallo's shop where he handcrafted the numerous steel sheets from a wooden mould. The individual parts were then fastened to a moulded girdle structure and joined with silver solder. Szilva worked with Jim Nemis, whose company Noront Steel was contracted to engineer, fabricate and install the framework of the Big Nickel. The large stainless steel panels were fabricated by Dalite Corporation of Toronto and shipped to the Big Nickel site in May 1964. When completed, the Big Nickel was high and thick. The artistic work such as the design of the King George VI head, the numerals, maple leaf and the refinery were contracted to Cavallo Signs. All artistic work was affixed to the stainless steel panels on site. The base, which was 12 feet high, 12 feet wide and , was constructed by the Maple Leaf Masonry Company of Sudbury. It was made of various ore- bearing rocks, field stone, and minerals mined in the Sudbury Basin in order to indicate the source of wealth in the Sudbury area. Upon its completion in 1964, the total cost of the construction of the Big Nickel was approximately $35,000. Opening On July 27, 1964, the park was officially opened. Szilva was extremely pleased that John Fisher, the Canadian Centennial commissioner, had accepted his invitation to be on hand to unveil the Big Nickel Monument to a crowd of 1,500. There was extensive media coverage of the event by The Sudbury Star, Canadian Coin News, and other Canadian publications as well as television coverage. The day marked both the culmination of many months of planning, and the beginning of an era, which would see The Big Nickel develop into a world-renowned landmark, and Sudbury into a northern tourist centre. In an attempt to market the park as a world-class tourist attraction, Szilva co- operated with the Sudbury Jaycees under president Allan Barnard in entering a float into the November 28, 1964 Grey Cup Parade with a replica of the monument along with the newly crowned 'Miss Big Nickel'. The underground model mine was built in 1965 by J.C. MacIsaac, of MacIsaac Mining and Tunnelling Co., and was expanded by the same company in 1969.MacIsaac Industries Ltd. Not only was the underground mine visited by over 100,000 people every year, but the mine represented the first time in Canadian history that a private enterprise and an educational institution, Cambrian College, would collaborate in order to provide on-site practical training in all facets of mining for students. The park was always expanding and adding new features. Some of these features included helicopter rides, a train track around the park carrying 55 passengers, a carousel, the famous \\"jail\\", moon module, and informative film. Articles and pictures featuring the Big Nickel appear in hundreds of books, and it is recognized as an international landmark. The Big Nickel, as the world's only numismatic coin park, also featured coin monuments other than the 1951 nickel. Some of these coin monuments were the $20 gold coin monument (featuring the Royal Coat of Arms of Canada), the Kennedy half-dollar coin memorial (featuring an eternal flame), the fantasy copper (Canadian one cent 1965) penny, and the Lincoln coin memorial (1965 American penny). There is no public record of the dismantling or current location of these other numismatic monuments, though pictures still exist. Mayor Joe Fabbro dedicated the wampum monument and Brotherhood of Man Memorial in May 1975. This memorial symbolized the early money traded by Canada's Aboriginal peoples and European settlers. Sudbury Science Centre In March 1975, Szilva expanded on the idea of creating a world-class mining science centre and submitted his proposal to the provincial minister of tourism in Toronto and to the Regional Municipality of Sudbury. Similar to the proposal of the Big Nickel, the idea was rejected by the government. The government at the time refused to give money to private enterprise. According to documented proposals and files, Szilva continued his efforts, and in 1980 he convinced the Regional Municipality of Sudbury to proceed with the development of a major tourist attraction, as the government was willing to grant the funds to non-profit organizations. Szilva sold the Big Nickel to the Regional Municipality of Sudbury for $550,000, and the Sudbury Science Centre, later to be named Science North, was founded. Big Nickel on original pedestal Dynamic Earth The Big Nickel at Science North On January 22, 2001, the Big Nickel was dismantled for refurbishing of both the coin and the facility. Once refurbished, the coin was installed on the grounds of Science North, and the original Big Nickel site was redesigned into the Dynamic Earth facility. On May 10, 2003, the coin was moved back to a plain kickstand on the Dynamic Earth grounds, and the stones of the original pedestal were discarded.

It is located adjacent to The Forks National Historic Site, near the city's downtown, and is home to the Winnipeg Goldeyes of the American Association. Features Winnipeg Goldeyes Baseball Club entranceShaw Park has a seating capacity of 7,481, as well as 30 luxury skysuites, a picnic area, and an open patio overlooking the field from the right field corner. An Indian cuisine restaurant is located on the third floor. A Goldeyes retail store and the baseball club's offices are also located within the ballpark. The playing field has a natural grass surface and a traditional dirt infield. The outfield dimensions are symmetrical, with distances of from home plate to each foul pole and to straightaway centerfield. The Canadian Museum for Human Rights and Esplanade Riel bridge are visible in the distance beyond the outfield fence. The Red River flows northward beyond the left field fence, on the far side of Waterfront Drive. Trains can be frequently seen and heard passing the ballpark, as it is built inside a curve of the main CN Rail line running through downtown Winnipeg. History Shaw Park, originally named CanWest Global Park, opened on May 24, 1999, replacing Winnipeg Stadium as the home of the Goldeyes and the city's premier baseball facility. It was built in three phases. When the stands along the third base side were completed, they extended halfway down the first base side, giving the stadium a seating capacity of 6,140. The second phase, completed in 2000, saw the first base stands partially extended, increasing seating capacity to 6,300, and the addition of the skysuites and concession space. The right field stands, patio, and restaurant were completed as part of the final phase in 2003. As part of the final expansion, the City of Winnipeg was required to reroute Pioneer and Water Avenues. A record attendance of 8,668 occurred on August 29 during the 2005 season. Winnipeg-based CanWest Global purchased the naming rights to the ballpark when it opened in 1999. CanWest Global Park later became Canwest Park after the media company's name change in 2008. Shaw Communications acquired the ballpark's naming rights when it acquired Canwest's broadcasting assets from bankruptcy court in 2010. The ballpark was renamed Shaw Park prior to the 2011 season. Major events The ballpark served as the main baseball venue for the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg. The host Canadian squad captured the bronze medal, which was their best finish ever, up to that point. Cuba won the gold medal, defeating the United States in the championship game. A number of future and former Major League players participated, including Mark Mulder, Brad Penny, Jos√© Contreras, Craig Paquette, and Adam Kennedy. The baseball tournament was a qualifier for the 2000 Summer Olympics. Outside of baseball, Shaw Park is occasionally used as an outdoor concert venue, having hosted top Canadian musical acts such as The Guess Who and The Tragically Hip.

As part of the Constitution of Canada, the section prohibits certain forms of discrimination perpetrated by the governments of Canada with the exception of ameliorative programs (e.g. employment equity). Rights under section 15 include racial equality, sexual equality, mental disability, and physical disability. In its jurisprudence, it has also been a source of LGBT rights in Canada. These rights are guaranteed to \\"every individual\\", that is, every natural person. This wording excludes \\"legal persons\\" such as corporations, contrasting other sections that use the word \\"everyone\\", where \\"legal persons\\" were meant to be included. Section 15 has been in force since 1985. Text Under the heading of \\"Equality Rights\\" this section states: Background The Canadian Bill of Rights of 1960 had guaranteed the \\"right of the individual to equality before the law and the protection of the law.\\" Equal protection of the law is a right that has been guaranteed by the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution since 1868.Hogg, Peter W. Constitutional Law of Canada. 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), 1067. Section 15 itself dates back to the earliest draft of the Charter, published in October 1980, but it was worded differently. It read, During the drafting, the guarantee to \\"everyone\\" was dropped in favour of \\"every individual,\\" with the intent that corporations could not invoke equality rights.Hogg, page 744. In addition, while the original version spoke of equality before the law and equal protection of the law, the section ultimately enacted included guarantees of equality under the law and equal benefit of the law. The reason for these additions was to encourage a generous reading of section 15. In the Bill of Rights cases Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974) and Bliss v. Canada (1979), Supreme Court Justice Roland Ritchie had said only the application, and not the outcome, of the law must be equal, thereby necessitating an explicit guarantee of equality under the law; and that legal benefits need not be equal, thereby necessitating an explicit guarantee of equal benefit of the law.Hogg, pages 1066‚Äì1067. Though the Charter itself came into effect on April 17, 1982, section 15 was not brought into force until April 17, 1985, in accordance with section 32(2) of the Charter. The reason for this was so that provincial and federal governments would have enough time to review their legislation and make the appropriate changes to any discriminatory laws. Meaning and purpose of equality According to the Supreme Court of Canada's Section 15 jurisprudence, the equality guarantees of section 15 are aimed at preventing the \\"violation of essential human dignity and freedom through the imposition of disadvantage, stereotyping, or political and social prejudices, and to promote a society in which all persons enjoy equal recognition at law as human beings or as members of Canadian society, equally capable and equally deserving of concern, respect and consideration.\\" (Iacobucci J. in Law v. Canada, [1999]) To that end, the Charter recognizes four dimensions of equality, including substantive equality: * Equality before the law is equality in the administration of justice, where all individuals are subject to the same criminal laws in the same manner by law enforcement and the courts. * Equality under the law is equality in the substance of the law, where the content of the law is equal and fair to everyone so that everyone experiences the same result. * Equal benefit of the law ensures that benefits imposed by law will be proportionate. * Equal protection of the law ensure that the protections imposed by law will be proportionate so that the human dignity of every person is equally safeguarded by the law. Unlike formal equality, which overlooks personal differences, substantive equality is concerned with the impact of the law on different groups of individuals. Substantive equality requires that there be an equal impact on the person affected by the law. Application of section fifteen In any challenge based on section 15(1), the burden of proof is always on the claimant. The Supreme Court of Canada has endorsed a purposive interpretation of Section 15. As with any other section, the equality rights section cannot invalidate another Constitutional provision (although they can assist in interpreting them), for example, rights or privileges guaranteed by or under the Constitution of Canada in respect of denominational, separate or dissentient schools (religious education). =Current interpretation= After Law v. Canada (1999) the question of whether dignity was affected was key to a section 15 analysis. In R. v. Kapp (2008), the problems with the dignity analysis were recognized and the dignity analysis was jettisoned. The Court established a two-part test based on the one found in Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia (1989): (1) Does the law create a distinction based on an enumerated or analogous ground? (2) Does the distinction create a disadvantage by perpetuating prejudice or stereotyping? In Quebec (Attorney General) v. A (2013) a majority of the Court found that perpetuating prejudice or stereotyping did not form an additional requirement in the second part of the test. The majority itself split on the correct way to apply the second part of the test, leaving the present state of the law on Section 15 unclear until 2015. The current framework for analyzing an alleged violation of s 15(1) of the Charter is that set out in Kahkewistahaw First Nation v. Taypotat (2015) at paras 19-20. Enumerated or analogous grounds Discrimination based upon sexual orientation is an analogous ground for discrimination, leading all but two provincial courts to legalize same-sex marriage in Canada. The concept of enumerated or analogous grounds originated in the essential 1989 Andrews case to refer to personal characteristics that, when being the basis of discrimination, show the discrimination is unconstitutional under section 15. There are nine enumerated grounds explicitly mentioned in section 15, although they are not actually numbered. In practice, the enumerated grounds have been given liberal and broad interpretations. For example, discrimination on the basis of pregnancy has been ruled to be sex discrimination (Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd.). As section 15's words \\"in particular\\" hint that the explicitly named grounds do not exhaust the scope of section 15, additional grounds can be considered if it can be shown that the group or individual's equality rights were denied in comparison with another group that shares all of the same characteristics except for the personal characteristic at issue. A personal characteristic is considered analogous to the ones enumerated in section 15 if it is \\"immutable\\" or cannot be changed or can only be changed at excessive cost (constructively immutable). Thus far, several analogous grounds have been identified: * sexual orientation (Egan v. Canada [1995], Vriend v. Alberta [1998], M. v. H. [1999] Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada [2000]) This finding has led provincial courts (the Supreme Court declined in Reference re Same-Sex Marriage to rule on the issue as the government had voiced its intent to legalize them anyway) to find that laws against same-sex marriage in Canada would be unconstitutional. In Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General) (2003), the Court of Appeal for Ontario used section 15 to legalize same-sex marriage in Ontario. * marital status (Miron v. Trudel, [1995], Nova Scotia v. Walsh [2002]), * off-reserve aboriginal status/\\"Aboriginality- residence\\" (Corbiere v. Canada). * citizenship (Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia [1989], Lavoie v. Canada [2000]) As well, the courts have rejected several analogous grounds including: * having a \\"taste for marijuana\\". (R. v. Malmo-Levine) * employment status (Reference Re Workers' Compensation Act [1989], Delisle v. Canada [1999]) * litigants against the Crown (Rudolph Wolff v. Canada [1990]) * province of prosecution/residence (R. v. Turpin [1989], R. v. S. (S.) [1990]) * membership in military (R. v. Genereux) * new resident of province (Haig v. Canada) * persons committing crimes outside Canada (R. v. Finta) * begging and extreme poverty (R. v. Banks) =Past interpretations: the Law test= As first outlined in Law v. Canada, discrimination can be identified through a three-step test. # Did the law, program, or activity impose differential treatment between the claimant and a comparator group? That is, was a distinction created between the groups in purpose or effect? # If so, was the differential treatment based on enumerated or analogous grounds? # If so, did the law in question have a purpose or effect that is discriminatory within the meaning of the equality guarantee? Discrimination For discrimination to be found it must be determined if the burden or denial of benefit harms an individual's human dignity (Law v. Canada). That is, the discrimination will marginalize, ignore, or devalue an individual's sense of self-respect and self-worth. Law suggests four \\"contextual factors\\" which can help guide a contextual analysis of whether the imputed distinction violates the human dignity of the claimant. None of these are determinative of discrimination, and the Court must not consider all of them in every case. This list is also not exhaustive, although the standard Law analysis has yet to develop any additional factors: # pre- existing disadvantage # correlation between the grounds of the claim and the actual needs, capacities, and circumstances # ameliorative purpose or effect of the law on more disadvantaged groups # nature and scope of interest Jurisprudence has shown that each of these factors are weighed differently depending on the context. Pre-existing disadvantage asks whether there was a pre-existing disadvantage or vulnerability experienced by the claimant. In Corbiere v. Canada [1999] McLachlin described this factor to be the most compelling and suggestive of discrimination if proven. However, the absence of a pre-existing disadvantage does not necessarily preclude a claimant from succeeding as seen in Trociuk v. British Columbia [2003]. With correlation between grounds and reality, the claimant must show that there is a link between the grounds raise and the claimant's actual needs, circumstances, and capacities. Discrimination will be more difficult to establish if the law takes the qualities of the claimant into account. In Gosselin v. Quebec (Attorney General) [2002] the court was sharply divided on this point. The majority said that the law that provided less social assistance to youth was connected to the ability of youth to find employment easily. However, the dissenters insisted that the evidence did not show this to be actual qualities, but were rather stereotypes. The ameliorative purpose factor asks whether there is a distinction made for the purpose of aiding an even less advantaged group. If this can be shown then it is unlikely that the claimant would be able to show a violation of their dignity. However, Lovelace v. Ontario [2000] warned that the analysis should not be reduced to a balancing of relative disadvantages. The final factor of nature and scope considers the nature and scope of the interest affected by the law. The more severe and localized the results of the law for those affected the more likely to show that the distinctions in treatment responsible are discriminatory. Enforcement Section 15, like the rest of the Charter, is mainly enforced by the courts through litigation under sections 24 and 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982. Such litigation can be very costly. To overcome this barrier, the federal government expanded the Court Challenges Program of CanadaCourt Challenges Program of Canada in 1985 to fund test cases challenging federal legislation in relation to the equality rights guaranteed by the Charter. Some funding has been provided to challenge provincial laws under a variety of programs in the past, but its availability has varied considerably from province to province.Arne Peltz & Betsy Gibbons, \\"Deep Discount Justice: The Challenge of Going to Court with a Charter Claim and No Money\\" , 1999.

BiographyEarly years= Michael Schwab was born in Bad Kissingen, Franconia in Germany in 1853. He was a bookbinder by trade. Schwab emigrated to the United States in 1879 and lived variously in Chicago, Milwaukee and the Western U.S. before settling permanently in Chicago in 1881. Schwab was married to the sister of Rudolph Schnaubelt (1863-1901), a Chicago anarchist believed by many to have actually thrown the bomb at Haymarket.\\"M. Schwab, the Anarchist, Passes Away,\\" Chicago Dispatch, June 29, 1898, unspecified page. Copy preserved in The Papers of Eugene V. Debs, 1834-1945 microfilm edition, reel 9. Together the couple would have three children. =Activism= Schwab became an activist even before emigrating to the United States, having written articles for several radical German newspapers. He joined the German Social Democratic Party in 1872. In the U.S., he became involved in the workers' rights movement, first joining the Socialist Labor Party and later joining the International Working Persons Association and helping to form North-Side Group faction of that organization. He began writing and eventually became co-editor of the Arbeiter-Zeitung, an anarchist newspaper for German immigrant workers. He was very active in the 8-hour day movement. =Haymarket= On the night of May 4, 1886, Schwab left the office of Arbeiter-Zeitung, and stopped at the Haymarket meeting to look for fellow editor, August Spies. Not finding him, Schwab spoke briefly with his brother-in-law, Rudolph Schnaubelt, who was later accused of being the bombthrower. Schwab contended that he was at the Haymarket for no more than five minutes. He left there to speak at a meeting of workers at the Deering Reaper Works at the corner of Fullerton and Clybourn streets. This is where he remained throughout the bombing and left there to go straight home. Schwab was arrested with the other six Haymarket rioters, while Albert Parsons turned himself in. In court, he was convicted along with his co-defendants and sentenced to death, while Oscar Neebe was sentenced to 15 years in prison. =Amnesty and later years= Schwab wrote to Illinois governor Richard James Oglesby for lenience and on November 10, 1887, Oglesby commuted his sentence, along with that of Samuel Fielden, to life imprisonment. He served six years at Joliet Penitentiary before being pardoned with the other two by Illinois Governor John Peter Altgeld on June 26, 1893. After his release, he continued to write for the Arbeiter-Zeitung and opened a shoe store from which he also sold books on labor rights, but his health was poor since leaving prison and the store failed. During his last years Schwab abandoned anarchist doctrine and embraced international socialism, speaking and writing in opposition to the notion of revolution by force. =Death and legacy= Schwab was troubled by \\"intestinal and pulmonary troubles\\" during his last several years, for which he was hospitalized at the Alexian Brothers' Hospital in Chicago for the same on November 12, 1897. He would remain hospitalized for the last seven months of his life, undergoing an operation in the middle of May 1898 in a vain effort to reverse his fate. Schwab expired from his chronic internal ailment at 3:30 am on the morning of June 29, 1898. He was 44 years old at the time of his death. Arrangements for Schwab's funeral were handled by the Social Turnverein of Chicago, which announced plans for the cremation of Schwab's body immediately after his death at Graceland Cemetery in Chicago. Schwab was cremated the morning of July 6, with his ashes turned over to his widow for disposition at her pleasure.\\"M.

He was one of the most innovative French composers of the late 16th century, combining voices and instruments in new ways, and importing some of the grand polychoral style of the Venetian School from Italy; he also composed a famous Requiem for the funeral of Pierre de Ronsard.  Life  Much of the biographical information about Mauduit comes from the writings of Marin Mersenne. Mauduit was born in Paris, and being an aristocrat, received an excellent education in humanities, languages and philosophy, but was evidently self-taught in music. Mauduit was a member of the Acad√©mie de Po√©sie et de Musique, the secretive group founded by Jean Antoine de Ba√Øf to promote musique mesur√©e √† l'antique, an attempt to recreate the rhetorical and ethical effect of ancient Greek music using modern French poetry and music. After the death of Joachim Thibault de Courville in 1581, Mauduit became the principal musician of the Acad√©mie. Evidently Mauduit was a man of some personal courage, for during the siege of Paris in 1589‚Äì1590, in the closing phase of the bloody French Wars of Religion, he assisted Claude Le Jeune in escaping from the city (had he been caught, both would have been executed), and he also helped save much of Le Jeune's music as well as the unpublished work of Ba√Øf. He outlived all of the other composers of the Acad√©mie, dying in Paris in 1627.  Music and influence  Mauduit was a prolific composer of chansons in the relatively recent style of musique mesur√©e, in which the rhythmic values assigned to notes exactly matched the stresses of the French words, typically in a 2:1 ratio of stressed to unstressed. While he never achieved the fame of Claude Le Jeune, part of this may have been due to Mersenne's failure to publish his complete works, a project which he promised but never completed. Mauduit's style was simple and clear, setting texts without alteration, and achieving variety using mostly harmonic means. While his five-voice Requiem mass for Pierre de Ronsard dates from 1585, Mauduit's first publication was a collection of Chansonnettes mesur√©es de Jean-Antoine de Ba√Øf, for four voices (1586). This collection was the first publication consisting exclusively of musique mesur√©e. Much of his music from the late 16th century is presumed to be lost. He was also a composer of airs de cour for solo voice and lute, as well as a ballet La d√©liverance de Renaud for 92 singers and 45 instrumentalists, which was performed in 1617. Among lost works mentioned by Mersenne are over 300 psalm settings, Vespers, Tenebrae settings, 104 hymns, masses and motets; indeed Mauduit may have suffered one of the highest percentages of lost music of any major composer of the late Renaissance. Mauduit continued to use the technique of musique mesur√©e into the 17th century, and in contexts for which it was not originally intended, such as large settings for groups of voices and instruments, some of which may have been in the Venetian style. Mersenne also credited Mauduit with introducing the viol consort into France; he also claimed that it was Mauduit who suggested adding the sixth string to the viol.

Early life and career Herbert was a younger son of Sir Edward Herbert, Lord Keeper to Charles II, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of the Master of Requests, Thomas Smith of Abingdon, Berkshire (now Oxfordshire) & Parson's Green, Middlesex, and widow of Thomas Carey of Sunninghill Park, Berkshire. He was brother of Arthur Herbert, 1st Earl of Torrington and became a scholar of Winchester in 1661, aged 13. He was elected probationer fellow of New College, Oxford, in August 1665, and, having graduated B.A. on 21 April 1609, entered the Middle Temple, where he was called to the bar. He practiced for some years in Ireland, and was there created king's counsel on 31 July 1677. Judicial advancement Returning to England he was appointed Chief Justice of Chester on 25 Oct. 1683, and on 10 February in the following year was knighted at Whitehall. In January 1684-5 he succeeded Sir John Churchill as Attorney General to the Duke of York, on whose succession to the crown he was appointed Attorney General to the queen. On 15 April he was returned to parliament for Ludlow. Like his father he had the highest notions of the royal prerogative, which much helped his advancement. On 16 Oct. 1685 he was sworn of the Privy Council, and on the 23rd he was called to the degree of Serjeant, giving rings with the significant motto 'Jacobus vincit, triumphat lex,' and the same day took his seat as Chief Justice of the King's Bench in succession to Jeffreys, who had been appointed lord chancellor. Jeffreys characteristically exhorted Herbert on this occasion to 'execute the law to the utmost of its vengeance upon those that are now known, and we have reason to remember them, by the name of whigs,' and 'likewise to remember the snivelling trimmers,' because 'our Saviour Jesus Christ says in the gospel that they that are not for us are against us '. Godden v Hales At the Rochester spring assizes in 1686 Sir Edward Hales, a Roman Catholic, was convicted for holding and acting under a commission in the army without taking the sacrament and the oaths of supremacy and allegiance in the manner prescribed by the Test Act. Thereupon his coachman, Arthur Godden, brought a collusive action against him in the king's bench for the prescribed penalty of ¬£500, to which Hales demurred, pleading a dispensation under the great seal. The case was argued before Herbert, who delivered formal judgment as follows : ' (1) That the kings of England are sovereign princes ; (2) that the laws of England are the king's laws; (3) that therefore it is an inseparable prerogative in the kings of England to dispense with penal laws in particular cases, and upon particular necessary reasons ; (4) that of these reasons and these necessities the king himself is the sole judge.' The plaintiff was accordingly nonsuited. The judgment occasioned general consternation in the country, and the judges were treated with scant respect on circuit. It was impugned as bad in point of law by Sir Robert Atkyns (1621‚Äì1709) in a tract entitled ' An Enquiry into the Power of dispensing with Penal Statutes.' Herbert replied with 'A Short Account of the Authorities in Law upon which judgment was given in Sir Edward Hales's case,' in which he argued that 'whatever is not prohibited by the law of God, but was lawful before any act of parliament made to forbid it, the king by his dispensation granted to a particular person may make lawful again to that person who has such dispensation, though it continues unlawful for everybody else.' Atkyns rejoined, and William Atwood, a barrister, also examined Herbert's vindication with much learning and ability. Decisions against the king's interest On 14 July 1686 Herbert was placed on the newly created ecclesiastical commission, a tribunal invested with as extensive jurisdiction over the clergy as the old Court of High Commission, and of which Jeffreys was the president. Having, however, refused to abet the king's design of introducing martial law by declining to order the execution of a deserter from the army, he was transferred to the chief-justiceship of the common pleas in April 1687, being succeeded in the king's bench by the more compliant Robert Wright. He still retained his place on the ecclesiastical commission, but gave further offence to the king by expressing the opinion that his proceedings in the case of Magdalen College could not be legalised by any exercise of his dispensing power, and by voting against the inhibition of the recalcitrant fellows from the exercise of their clerical functions. Loyalty to James II On the flight of the king Herbert followed him to France and afterwards to Ireland, and was accordingly excepted from the bill of indemnity and included in a Bill of attainder. The latter bill lapsed owing to an early prorogation, but Herbert's estates were sequestrated, the royal palace of Oatlands, Weybridge, Surrey, which had been granted to him by James shortly before his abdication, being given to his brother Arthur, Earl of Torrington, who had taken the opposite side in politics. On the suppression of the Irish rebellion Herbert returned with James to France and resided for a time at St. Germain-en-Laye. He received from James the title of Earl of Portland and the office of Lord Chancellor, and busied himself in writing manifestos for his master. As a Protestant he had never enjoyed James's full confidence, and being a somewhat free speaker he soon lost what he had, was dismissed, and retired to Flanders in the autumn of 1692. He afterwards returned to St. Germain-en-Laye, where he subsisted principally on the charity of his brother until his death in November 1698. He was unmarried. Burnet says of him that, though he was but an indifferent lawyer, 'he was a well-bred and a virtuous man, and generous and good-natured.'

Early life and education √âlias Sarkis was born in Chebanieh, a mixed Christian-Druze mountain village, to a shopkeeping family on 20 July 1924. His family was Maronite Christian. Sarkis attended the Chebanieh School and Fr√®res School in Beirut. He began to work as a railway clerk during his university education, and then, graduated with a law degree from Saint Joseph University in 1948. Career After graduation, Sarkis worked as a lawyer for three years. Next, he became the protege of Lebanese army commander Fuad Chehab who would be the Lebanese president in 1958. Sarkis was then appointed magistrate of the court of accounts and then, director general of the chamber of the presidency of the Republic in 1953. Later, he was appointed governor of the central bank of Lebanon in 1968 and his tenure lasted for 9 years. His appointment was upon the request of then-president Charles Helou, who asked him to reorganize the Lebanese banking systems facing a bank crisis in 1968. Presidency Sarkis contested the presidential election of 1970 as Chehab's prot√©g√© and was expected to win but was defeated by Suleiman Frangieh by a single vote. Sarkis was, however, elected President for six-year term on 8 May 1976, while the Lebanese Civil War was raging. His election as president was thought to occur under the pressure from the Syrians. In other words, he was a candidate of Damascus and preferred president of late Hafez Assad. The election was held in the Versailles-style Esseily Villa, a private residence in Southeastern Beirut, since The National Assembly building was not safe due to ongoing attacks and battle. Sixty-six members of the Assembly elected him president on 8 May 1976. On the other hand, twenty-nine members of the Assembly boycotted the session. These members were among leftist and Palestinian groups. His sworn ceremony could not also be held at the Assembly, and he had to sworn at a hotel in the eastern city of Shtaura, 25 miles from Beirut. Sarkis could move to office four months after his election on 23 September 1976, since former President Frangieh objected at first to leave office. Sarkis could appoint Salim Hoss as prime minister in December 1976. When Sarkis effectively began to serve as the President, he could not forge a lasting accommodation between Christian and Muslim factions. Also, the growing independent power of the Palestinian guerrillas in Lebanon prompted two large-scale Israeli attacks, in 1978 and 1982. Several nationalist and leftist political parties and organizations created the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) under the leadership of Kamal Jumblatt in 1976. The conservative forces led by the Christian Kata'ib (Phalange) Party was another block called the Lebanese Front. President Sarkis tried various initiatives to find a negotiated settlement to the conflict, but all were unsuccessful. Because these two groups had their own goals. The Lebanese Front was gradually strengthened its position, awaiting favorable regional developments to impose its own will. The LNM, on the other hand, was too dependent on the Palestinians and unable to initiate a political negotiation process in ceasing the civil war. In November 1976, Sarkis wanted to include Druze za'im Kamal Jumblatt in the cabinet. However, Hafez Assad did not permit it due to Jumblatt's clear opposition to Syria's increasing influence in Lebanon. On 5 March 1980, Sarkis developed his policy as part of his attempts to create national accord: unity, independence, parliamentarian democracy, rejecting the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel. In June 1980, Salim Hoss resigned in protest against his inability to create peace in Lebanon. After much difficulties, Sarkis was able to appoint Shafik Wazzan as new prime minister. Sarkis was described as one who was in office but not in power. Just before the end of his term in 1982, Israel invaded southern Lebanon in the 1982 Lebanon War and had advanced to the outskirts of Beirut. He organized a peacekeeping force involving U.S., British, French and Italian troops in Beirut after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon to drive out the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1982. In addition, Sarkis formed the rescue committee in 1982 to make arrangements regarding the results of the Israeli invasion. The members of the committee included the Amal movement‚Äôs leader, Nabih Berri, and the hardline Christian leader Bashir Gemayel. The body was significant in that it caused tensions in the Amal movement, because Hussein Musawi left the Amal protesting against Berri and founded Islamic Amal after this event. Sarkis gained the respect of many Lebanese during his term, but critics accused him of indecisiveness. However, he was regarded as the choice of Syria but not the Muslim-Palestinian alliance. For that reason, 29 members of the Assembly boycotted the election session. Succession Sarkis was to be succeeded by Bachir Gemayel, who was elected President on the 23rd of August 1982 with 27 votes. However, Gemayel was assassinated 21 days before he was due to take office. Amine Gemayel, Bachir's brother, was subsequently elected in his stead, and Sarkis handed the presidency over to him on 23 September 1982. Death Sarkis died in Paris from cancer on 27 June 1985, at the age of 60. His body was returned to Lebanon. Then-Lebanese President Amine Gemayel led mourners at his funeral in Beirut on 29 June 1985. The requiem mass in East Beirut was attended by a Syrian delegation led by a government minister representing then Syrian president Hafez Assad. His body was buried in his hometown, Chebanieh, on the same day.

The patent specifically involved the intermediacy of TiI4 and ZrI4, which were volatilized (leaving impurities as solid). At atmospheric pressure TiI4 melts at 150 ¬∞C and boils at 377 ¬∞C, while ZrI4 melts at 499 ¬∞C and boils at 600 ¬∞C. The boiling points are lower at reduced pressure. The gaseous metal tetraiodide is decomposed on a white hot tungsten filament (1400 ¬∞C). As more metal is deposited the filament conducts better and thus a greater electric current is required to maintain the temperature of the filament. The process can be performed in the span of several hours or several weeks, depending on the particular setup. Generally, the crystal bar process can be performed using any number of metals using whichever halogen or combination of halogens is most appropriate for that sort of transport mechanism, based on the reactivities involved.

According to Sh≈çshin Nagamine, in his \\"Tales of Okinawa's Great Masters\\", there are no accurate historical documents surrounding the origins of grappling in Okinawa. It seems that tegumi evolved from a primitive form of grappling self-defense, which was constantly being adapted and enhanced as it was exposed to outside influences. It is believed by some, Nagamine included, that tegumi was probably the original form of fighting in Okinawa and, as it was enhanced by striking and kicking techniques imported from China, became the progenitor of Te, which is the foundation of modern karate. Known as tegumi in Naha, and mut≈ç in Tomari and Shuri, Okinawan wrestling remained a popular cultural recreation until the Taish≈ç period (1912 - 1925). There is little evidence of how tegumi evolved but the result was a rough and tumble bout where the winner was decided by submission, through joint locks, strangles or pinning. Today, tegumi has a strict set of rules and is still practiced widely.

It is located at the intersection of the Goulburn-Oberon Road and the Laggan-Taralga Road. It is accessible from Oberon to the north, Mittagong to the east, Goulburn to the south, and Crookwell to the west. At the , Taralga had a population of 467. Taralga is located relatively close to the famous Wombeyan Caves. The town experiences a volatile climate and is frequently affected by snow in the winter months. The population of Taralga has fluctuated over time reflecting the town's fortunes. There were approximately 100 residents in 1863, growing to over 700 by the 1890s. Immediately after the depression of the 1890s, the population shrank to half this size, but recovered by the mid 1950s almost to its peak level. Today the town and surrounds service around 400 people.  Naming  The exact origin of the name Taralga is disputed. The two most widely supported theories are that the village was originally known as \\"Trial Gang\\" as within the early colonial boundaries of Argyle County, it was a location for the trials of convicts and bushrangers before the Crown. The second theory is that Taralga means \\"native companion\\" in the language of the Burra Aboriginal people. A newspaper editorial in 1886 suggests the word Taralga is a corruption of 'Trialgong', an Indigenous word for 'three stony hills' (presumably in the Burra language), rather than a corruption of 'Trial gang'. Also, explorer Thomas Mitchell mentioned 'Trialgong creek' in his field, note and sketchbook in 1828. History The area around Taralga was the traditional land of the Burra Burra peoples, a warlike tribe who often clashed with neighbouring tribes and never lost a fight. Although no major clashes with the Europeans seem to have been recorded, nor tales of collaboration with them, their last great gathering or corroboree seems to have been in the 1830s after which they are not recorded by European history. Accordingly, they would have been pushed further west to less fertile plains after the disease brought by the Europeans. Charles Throsby passed through the Taralga area in 1819 on a journey from Cowpastures to Bathurst in search of new grazing lands. By 1824, John Macarthur's son James and his nephew Hannibal had established themselves in the Taralga region where they helped pioneer Australia's wool industry. A private village was established on land donated by James Macarthur and cleared by convicts in order to house and service members of the Macarthur family and their employees. Orchard Street, now the main thoroughfare is located on the site of Macarthur's orchard. During the town's early history, Macarthur Street functioned as the main street and many examples of heritage buildings still stand here. An 1828 census revealed a small number of residents at Taralga suggesting the village was already under way by that time, although there were probably no more than a few buildings. For the first few decades of the colony of New South Wales, most of the settlers were convicts assigned to the landowners and it was they who largely cleared the land, built the huts and houses, and ran the farms. Taralga started to look like a town after the first few houses were built in the 1840s, but more rapid growth would be experienced in the 1860s in part due to the Robertson Land Acts allowing freehold title over land to settlers at favourable rates. Taralga was officially established as a town in the 1860s, with a school in 1857, and churches--Presbyterian in 1861, St. Ignatius Roman Catholic in 1864, St. Lukes Anglican in 1866 and Methodist (now the Historical Society building) in 1868. There were a number of stores, smiths and artisans' businesses and two hotels recorded in 1866. There was a large increase in population in Taralga after the 1860s, caused mainly by the gold rush bringing new migrants to the area. Taralga railway station In 1923, the town was visited by Premier Sir George Fuller, marking a period of renewed interest and prosperity in Taralga. During this visit, the Premier unveiled a war memorial honouring those residents who served in World War I, turned the first sod for construction of a railway link as well as laying the foundation stone for the Taralga Co-Operative Dairy Company's new butter factory. The Taralga railway line, constructed as a branch from the Crookwell line at Roslyn opened in 1926 and closed in 1957. The line has since been lifted and little remains of the formation. Electricity was first provided in the 1930s by way of a plant set up by local Mr Sid Holt.  Heritage listings  Taralga has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Macarthur Street: Catholic Church of Christ the King Taralga today Winter in Taralga While the population of Taralga declined after the gold rush period, the character of the town did not. Today there are many historically significant buildings to be observed throughout the town. Small vineyards are located around the town. There are two heritage listed hotels, and a sports club with lawn bowling greens and tennis courts. There is a 9-hole golf course with sand greens. The town also hosts the annual \\"Australia Day Rodeo\\" and the Taralga Tigers Rugby Club always attracts big crowds during the Winter months and in the summer touch football is played. The town is situated on the Goulburn-Oberon Road, designated Main Road 256 which was progressively upgraded between 2002 and 2008. Taralga is the largest settlement between the two towns and a convenient stop for travellers between Goulburn and Bathurst wishing to bypass Sydney. The town can also be accessed by rural roads from Crookwell and Marulan. =Taralga Wind Farm= On 20 February 2012, approval was granted by the New South Wales Government for work to commence on the Taralga Wind Farm. The project will see the construction of 51 wind turbines generating 106.8 Megawatts of electricity on ridges to the east of Taralga. Electricity generated by the project will be fed into the national power grid through a 38 km transmission line to Marulan Substation. The project is expected to create up to 200 local jobs during the construction phase. Approval of the wind farm followed an unsuccessful challenge by the Taralga Landscape Guardians in the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales to block the project on the grounds of aesthetic and environmental impacts including noise emissions and blighting of the landscape. Chief Justice Brian Preston ruled in favour of approving the wind farm as the long term benefit of reduced greenhouse gas emissions was in the greater public interest. As of 6 February 2015, 30 turbines have been erected on site, and all are turning while in their commissioning phase. The end of construction is expected to happen around June, with the Operational period to follow soon thereafter, once AEMO testing is completed. The layout of the wind farm can be seen through this link Climate Taralga has an oceanic climate. Temperatures are warm in summer, whereas winters are cool during days and with frequent air frosts by nightfall. Precipitation is relatively frequent year-round, peaking in winter and spring with a notable quantity of snowfall and sleet. Summer minima can occasionally be cold due to high diurnal temperature variation, as well as lack of strong winds or cloud‚Äîunlike winter, in which cloud and strong winds are frequent. The lowest maximum temperature was recorded in August 1962; the warmest maximum temperature recorded was in January 2020. The coldest low plummeted to in July 1982; the warmest low on record was in February 1973.

It now falls on the Thursday after the final day of classes, on the university campus. The Slope Day Programming Board (SDPB) is responsible for organizing the event, selecting artists, and managing the Slope Day's execution. Though Slope Day has gone through many phases, in recent years focus has shifted to live music and catered food and beverages on the Slope. History of Slope Day Slope Day, then known as Spring Day, in 1904Slope Day's origins can be traced to 1890, when the annual Navy Ball began on the Cornell University campus. The Navy Ball, held in October on the day before a major regatta on Cayuga Lake, was an evening dance with a band for the purpose of raising funds to support the Cornell crew and other athletic programs. Students traditionally skipped classes on the day of the regatta following the ball. In 1901, the Navy Ball was moved from October to May for the first time, and a committee including John L. Senior, Willard Straight, and Henry Schoellkopf arranged the event and entertainment. Attendance in classes on the following day was dismal, and in 1902, the university declared the following day a holiday called Spring Day. The annual Spring Day festivities involved a wide range of activities, from mock bullfights to circuses, typically on the Arts Quad. Spring Day remained a Cornell tradition for over 50 years.\\"The Navy Ball,\\" Cornell Alumni News, May 1, 1901.\\"Festive Atmosphere Prevails Through Spring Day History,\\" The Cornell Daily Sun, May 14, 1954. However, during the 1960s and 1970s, official Spring Day celebrations were considered an anachronism, as Cornell was in the midst of Vietnam-era protests and civil unrest. Sunshine Memorial Festival, May 16, 1971 A brief revival occurred in the spring of 1971. The Sunshine Memorial Festival was organized by a Cornell student group, Ithaca Rapid Transit. It was sponsored by Maxwell‚Äôs Coffee House, a student run coffee house (founded by Daniel Vlock ‚Äò74 in 1971 in the freshman dormitory Mary Donlon Hall) and Noyes Center. Maxwell‚Äôs was the first coffee house in North Campus and was named after a dog housed in the dormitory and not the Beatles song. For the concert a plywood stage was constructed at the base of Libe Slope. The speaker system was provided by Cornell Engineering School students and was powered by extension cords plugged into outlets in student dormitory rooms. Several local bands played for free. The best known was Boffalongo. Boffalongo subsequently became King Harvest and were known for their hit song ‚ÄúDancing in the Moonlight‚Äù. An estimated 5,000 people attended. Music and dancing took place until midnight when the Cornell Safety Patrol turned off the electricity. Two additional Sunshine Memorial Festival events were planned for the Spring and Fall of 1972. However, as is typical for Ithaca weather, they were rained out. In 1979, an event then called \\"Springfest\\" was held on the last day of classes. Cornell Dining sponsored a chicken barbecue on Libe Slope and served beer to the students. At the time, New York State's drinking age was 18, making it easy for the university to sponsor both food and alcohol service for the event. For the next six years, Springfest involved live bands playing at the base of Libe Slope, with students dancing and drinking on the Slope itself. In December 1985, New York state raised the drinking age to 21, so University officials announced that the 1986 Springfest would be held in a fenced-in area on North Campus instead of the Slope. The student body responded with a massive \\"Take Back the Slope\\" campaign. All across campus, T-shirts, signs and chalk on sidewalks beckoned students to boycott the official Springfest and \\"Take Back the Slope.\\" They did by the thousands, and the name \\"Slope Day\\" replaced \\"Springfest.\\" In 1987, the University caved to pressure and had Robert Cray play on the Slope, but by 1988 the bands were gone once again and Slope Day became an unofficial event. For the next decade or so, the University tolerated Slope Day, and took little action to control it except for the banning of beer kegs in 1991. For many students the focus of Slope Day became the consumption of excessive amounts of alcohol. Libe Slope Starting in the mid 90s, the University began a more gradual reining in of Slope Day, instead of repeating the failed strategy of regaining control all at once. SlopeFest, an alcohol-free event featuring carnival-style entertainment started to take place on West Campus in 1999. In 2001, the amount and type of alcohol students could bring onto the slope was limited. Starting in 2003, the Slope Day Steering Committee (initially organized as the President's Council on Alcohol and Other Drugs by president-emeritus Hunter S. Rawlings III) took charge of Slope Day, restricted access to Libe Slope, brought live entertainment, and provided catered food and drink service. This time, the University's assertion of control succeeded. The students did not revolt as their predecessors had done in the late 1980s, leading to increased University prohibitions against drinking at the event. Recent Slope Day measures have tried to limit excess underage drinking. Bracelets with tabs that are used as tickets to purchase alcohol are only offered to those who are of age, and only one drink is sold per purchase. Free water has been handed out to all attendees since 2006, and several volunteers on the slope have supervised students. Current Slope Day Activities Libe Slope fills the lower portion of this photograph taken from McGraw Tower. In the fall of 2003 the Slope Day Programming Board was created by the Cornell University Student Assembly (SA), under the leadership of SA president Justin Fishbone, to lead the planning of social and recreational activities on Slope Day. The Slope Day Programming Board (SDPB) has an open membership policy for all undergraduate and graduate students at Cornell, and it works closely with university administrators and the Slope Day Steering Committee. The SDPB aims to create a fun and safe celebration for the entire Cornell community. Recently, access to these activities on Libe Slope and Ho Plaza and at nearby campus locations has been restricted to Cornell students, faculty, and staff, as well as selected guests.

In the past, this event has included various raffles, an airbrush tattoo artist and inflatable games. Started in 1999 by concerned students of the Slope Day Programming Board, SlopeFest was held on West Campus and hosted carnival-style games, food, and live musical performances. Starting in 2004, SlopeFest was incorporated into the main events of Slope Day and held inside the event perimeter. SlopeFest is now held on Ho Plaza. The Slope Day Programming Board, composed of students, plans all aspects of SlopeFest.

The venue is the summer home of The Cleveland Orchestra and site of the ensemble‚Äôs annual Blossom Festival. Blossom Music Center is owned by the Musical Arts Association, the Orchestra‚Äôs parent organization. The music center is named after the families of Dudley S. Blossom, Sr., and Dudley S. Blossom, Jr. The former had served as the president of the Musical Arts Association from 1936 to 1938, and his widow Elizabeth and daughter-in-law Emily continued to support the Musical Arts Association after Dudley Jr.‚Äôs death in 1961. The Board‚Äôs president, Frank E. Joseph, felt that the Blossom family was ‚Äúmore deserving of the honor than any other Cleveland family.‚Äù The pavilion is constructed of slate and tubular steel, and seats 6,051 people. Behind the pavilion is a general-admission lawn section, which can seat an additional 15,000 audience members. The venue is also host to a full summer schedule of popular music acts and symphonic performances. Blossom‚Äôs natural parabolic setting, the pavilion‚Äôs sloping slate roof, and the countryside‚Äôs wooded surroundings distinguish it from other contemporary amphitheaters. For many years, members of The Cleveland Orchestra had struggled to gain year-round employment playing music. During the early 1950s, summer performances were held at Public Hall in downtown Cleveland and, on occasion, in the outfield of Cleveland Stadium before Indians‚Äô games. In the mid-1960s, music director George Szell was driven to find employment for his musicians throughout the summer months. Beginning in 1965, the Musical Arts Association began to investigate possible sites on which to build the Orchestra‚Äôs new summer home. Szell had a clear vision in mind: ‚ÄúIt is of course IMPERATIVE to have such an installation for the summer, it seems to me even more important to have it turn out to be exceptional, absolutely first rate, terribly attractive...‚Äù In July 1966, the Musical Arts Association decided to purchase 571 acres of land near Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, which is approximately 10 miles north of Akron and about 30 miles south of Cleveland. (Eventually, more land was acquired to bring the total amount owned by the Musical Arts Association to 800 acres.) By 1967, the Musical Arts Association would launch its ‚ÄúHalf Century Campaign‚Äù to raise money for the construction of Blossom‚Äôs pavilion. The initial collaboration included Connecticut-based acoustician Christopher Jaffe and Cleveland architectural firm Shafer, Flynn and Van Dijk, which oversaw the modeling and building of the amphitheater. As construction proceeded, Jaffe was replaced by German recording engineer Heinrich Heilholz, whom Szell preferred. The fundraising campaign reached its goal of $6.6 million, and ground was broken on July 2, 1967. The Blossom Festival‚Äôs inaugural concert, featuring Beethoven‚Äôs Ninth Symphony conducted by Szell, took place on July 19, 1968, with a live television broadcast on WKYC-TV3. The following year the Orchestra hosted its first Fourth of July concert at Blossom ‚Äî led by Meredith Wilson, who composed The Music Man. In 2003, Blossom underwent a $17 million renovation intended to enhance a number of areas across the venue, including the sound system, stage, guest services, parking lots, and landscaping. In a transaction designed to give the Orchestra a financial boost and protect Blossom‚Äôs natural surroundings, the Musical Arts Association sold 580 acres of the site‚Äôs undeveloped land to the National Park Service in 2011. Blossom is also widely used for popular music events, especially folk, rock, and country. The largest recorded show attendance at Blossom was for a Blood, Sweat and Tears concert in 1969, just one year after the venue's opening, totaling in 24,364. An unofficial estimate to a Pink Floyd concert in 1973 claims 32,000 were in attendance.Hullett, Julie. 'Five things you don't know about ... Blossom Music Center\\" Fresh Water July 11, 2018: L1 The amphitheater has played host to many music festivals, Lollapalooza, Mayhem Festival, Ozzfest, and Vans Warped Tour.

The nearest town is Coonabarabran. The area is easiest accessed from the Newell Highway which is the major road link directly between Melbourne, Victoria and Brisbane, Queensland and cuts across inland New South Wales from the north to the south. As the range is between the moist eastern coastal zone and the dryer plains to the west, it has provided protection for flora and fauna suited to both habitats. There are over 120 bird species identified on the range, including lories and lorikeets, rosellas and parrots. The centre of the range has served as an area of protection for a healthy and content colony of grey kangaroos. These animals have become fairly tame due to constant visitor attention and are easily approached. The Siding Spring Observatory is located on Mount Woorut, an eastern peak. The area has little to no light pollution to disturb astronomical viewing. In 2016, the International Dark-Sky Association declared the Warrumbungle National Park as Australia's first International Dark Sky Park. The Warrumbungles hosted the 2006 World Rogaining Championships. Geology The base of the region was formed 180 million years ago. At that time a lake was formed that allowed sediment to slowly compress into sandstone. The Warrumbungles are the remnants of a large heavily-eroded shield volcano which was active from 13 to 17 million years ago. The volcano is estimated to have been high and wide. It formed as volcanic explosions occurred over millions of years. The remaining complex rocky formations are what is left after millions of years of erosion. =Physiography= This area is also known as the Warrumbungle-Liverpool Basalt Ranges, which is a distinct physiographic section of the larger Hunter- Hawkesbury Sunkland province, which in turn is part of the larger East Australian Cordillera physiographic division. =Formations= The main features of the Warrumbungle mountains are a series of huge jagged outcrops in a roughly circular pattern, surrounded by hilly bush and woodland forest. Dykes, plugs and domes are common and mostly made from trachyte. The Grand High Tops is a section of the range where volcanic remnants are especially clustered. These vents and rocky formations are all named - Belougery Spire, Belougery Split Rock, Crater Bluff, Bluff Mountain, The Breadknife and Mount Exmouth. Pyroclastic rock is found in this area. The Breadknife, a straight wall of jagged rock nearly high, is particularly rare. There is an extensive network of nine walking tracks across the central peaks. Crater Bluff, 1994 Towards the southeast a broad belt of basalt outcrops extends towards the Liverpool Range. Near Chalk Mountain are outcrops of diatomite. Outer stretches of the volcano are made up of hawaiite and mugearite. History The first European to sight and explore the area was John Oxley in 1818 on second expedition through New South Wales. Oxley named the range the Arbuthnot Range. The Gamilaroi name Warrumbungles which means 'crooked mountains' became the most common name. Belougery Spire was first ascended by Eric Dark and Osmar White in 1932, and Crater Bluff by Dark and Dorothy English (better known by her later married name, Dorothy 'Dot' Butler) in 1936. The Breadknife was not ascended until 1954, by Russ Kippax and Bill Peascod. Climbing on the Breadknife has since been banned, to protect the walking track along its base from rockfall. Lieben, on Crater Bluff, was the most difficult rock climb in Australia for many years after its first ascent by Bryden Allen and Ted Batty in 1962. It was graded 17 ‚Äî the hardest grade in the Ewbank system at the time ‚Äî but is generally agreed to be much harder. By 1953, of the range was recognised for its natural heritage and preserved as Warrumbungle National Park. In 2011, it was reported that the national park is contained within .

These cats were originally known from fragments of skeletons, but nearly complete skeletons have been recovered from Natural Trap Cave in northern Wyoming. The two species commonly identified are M. inexpectatus and M. trumani. Sometimes, a third species, M. studeri, is included, but it is more often listed as a junior synonym of M. trumani. Both species are similar to the modern cheetah, with faces shortened and nasal cavities expanded for increased oxygen capacity, and legs proportioned for swift running. However, these similarities may not be inherited from a common ancestor, but may instead result from either parallel or convergent evolution. These were larger than a modern cheetah and similar in size to a modern northern cougar. Body mass was typically around , with a head-and-body length of , tail length around , and shoulder height of . Large specimens could have weighed more than . Taxonomy and evolution Research into the American cheetah has been contradictory. It was originally believed to be an early cougar representative, before being reclassified in the 1970s as a close relative of the cheetah. This suggested that the ancestors of the cheetah diverged from the Puma lineage in the Americas and migrated back to the Old World, a claim repeated as recently as 2006 by Johnson et al., and in 2015 by Dobrynin et al. However, other research by Barnett and Faurby, through examining mitochondrial DNA and reanalyzing morphology, has suggested reversing the reclassification: the American cheetah developed cheetah-like characteristics through parallel evolution, but it is most closely related to Puma and not to the modern cheetah of Africa and Asia. Moreover, Faurby notes that no Acinonyx fossils have been found in North America, and no Miracinonyx fossils elsewhere. However, O'Brien et al. (2016) posit that the supposed homoplasy between the genera is controversial, as it is asserted that is not necessarily any conclusive anatomical or genetic basis for dismissing a homologous relationship between Acinonyx and Miracinonyx. The veracity of the origin of the modern cheetah is also debated; however, Miracinonyx is believed to have evolved from cougar-like ancestors, regardless of whether in the Old World or the New World. The cougar and M. trumani are believed to have split from a cougar-like ancestor around three million years ago; where M. inexpectatus fits in is unclear, although it is probably a more primitive version of M. trumani. Miracinonyx trumani M. trumani was the animal morphologically most similar to true cheetahs. Living on the prairies and plains of western and central North America, it was probably a predator of hoofed plains animals, such as the pronghorn. In fact, predation by Miracinonyx is thought to be the reason pronghorns evolved to run so swiftly, their 60-mph top speed being much more than was needed to outrun extant American predators, such as cougars and gray wolves. Miracinonyx inexpectatus M. inexpectatus was more similar to the cougar than was M. trumani, its proportions being between that of the cougar and M. trumani. It had fully retractable claws, and with its lighter build, M. inexpectatus was probably faster than the cougar. Due to its retractable claws, it possibly was more adept at climbing than M. trumani.

Typically, Orthents are exceedingly shallow soils. They are often referred to as skeletal soils or, in the FAO soil classification, as lithosols. The basic requirement for recognition of an orthent is that any former soil has been either completely removed or so truncated that the diagnostic horizons typical of all orders other than entisols are absent. Most orthents are found in very steep, mountainous regions where erodible material is so rapidly removed by erosion that a permanent covering of deep soil cannot establish itself. Such conditions occur in almost all regions of the world where steep slopes are prevalent. In Australia and a few regions of Africa, orthents occur in flat terrain because the parent rock contains absolutely no weatherable minerals except short-lived additions from rainfall, so that there is no breaking down of the minerals (chiefly iron oxides) in the rock. The steepness of most orthents causes the flora on them to be sparse shrubs or grassland. In those on ancient, flat terrain, dry grassland, savanna, or rarely, rainforest can prevail. Because of their extreme shallowness and, usually, steepness and consequent high erosion hazard, Orthents are not suitable for arable farming. The flora typically supported on them is generally of very poor nutritive value for grazing, so that typically only low stocking rates are practicable. Many orthents are very important as habitat for wildlife.

The disaster killed more than 295 students and teachers. , the event is the third deadliest disaster in the history of Texas, after the 1900 Galveston hurricane and the 1947 Texas City disaster. Background In the mid-1930s, the Great Depression was in full swing, but the London school district was one of the richest in America. A 1930 oil find in Rusk County had boosted the local economy and educational spending grew with it. Its taxable value in 1937 had grown to $20 million, with additional revenue seen from 15 oil wells on district property. The London School, a large structure of steel and concrete, was constructed in 1932 at a cost of $1 million (roughly $ today). The London Wildcats (a play on the term \\"wildcatter\\", for an oil prospector) played football in the first stadium in the state to have electric lights. London School before the explosion The school was built on sloping ground and a large air space was enclosed beneath the structure. The school board had overridden the original architect's plans for a boiler and steam distribution system, instead opting to install 72 gas heaters throughout the building. Early in 1937, the school board canceled their natural gas contract and had plumbers install a tap into Parade Gasoline Company's residue gas line to save money. This practice‚Äîwhile not explicitly authorized by local oil companies‚Äîwas widespread in the area. The natural gas extracted with the oil was considered a waste product and was flared off. As there was no value to the natural gas, the oil companies turned a blind eye. This \\"raw\\" or \\"wet\\" gas varied in quality from day to day, even from hour to hour.Cornell, James C. (1983), The Great International Disaster Book (3rd ed.), Charles Scribner's Sons. Untreated natural gas is both odorless and colorless, so leaks are difficult to detect and may go unnoticed. Gas had been leaking from the residue line tap and built up inside the enclosed crawlspace that ran the entire length of the building's facade. Students had been complaining of headaches for some time, but little attention had been paid to the issue. Explosion March 18 was a Thursday. Friday's classes were canceled to allow students to participate in the neighboring city of Henderson's Interscholastic Meet, a scholastic and athletic competition. Following the school's normal schedule, first through fourth grade students had been let out early. A PTA meeting was being held in the gymnasium, a separate structure roughly from the main building. Approximately 500 students and 40 teachers were in the building at the time, although some numbers claim there were roughly 694 students in the building and at the campus. At 3:17 p.m., Lemmie R. Butler, an \\"instructor of manual training\\", turned on an electric sander. It is believed that the sander's switch caused a spark that ignited the gas-air mixture. Reports from witnesses state that the walls of the school bulged, the roof lifted from the building and then crashed back down, and the main wing of the structure collapsed. However, there was no fire after the explosion. Survivors in the building claimed that lockers embedded in the wall were thrown at them by the blast, others were picked up by the force of the explosion, and the plaster and mortar formed a white haze. The force of the explosion was so great that a two-ton concrete block was thrown clear off the building and crushed a 1936 Chevrolet parked 200 feet away. Those who evacuated the building after the explosion were in a state of shock, with some recounting that they did not know what to do next and that it seemed the world was deadly silent until the sound came back all at once. The explosion was its own alarm, reportedly heard up to four miles away from the school. The most immediate response was from parents at the PTA meeting. Within minutes, area residents started to arrive and began digging through the rubble, many with their bare hands. Many survivors also joined in the immediate aftermath in recovery of other survivors and victims. Roughnecks from the oil fields were released from their jobs and brought with them cutting torches and heavy equipment needed to clear the concrete and steel. Not all of the buildings on the campus were destroyed. School bus driver Lonnie Barber was transporting elementary students to their homes and was in sight of the school as it exploded. Barber continued his two- hour route, returning children to their parents before rushing back to the school to look for his four children. His son Arden died, but the others were not seriously injured. Other school buses were employed to drive ambulatory survivors back to their homes, causing family members who were waiting at the bus stops to demand information from students disembarking.  Rescue and recovery  New London School Explosion News Aid poured in from outside the area. Governor James Allred dispatched Texas Rangers, highway patrol, and the Texas National Guard. Thirty doctors, 100 nurses, and 25 embalmers arrived from Dallas. Airmen from Barksdale Field, deputy sheriffs, and even Boy Scouts took part in the rescue and recovery. In their desperation to get victims and survivors out of the rubble, many rescuers did not immediately check if the body they came across was alive or dead. Rescuers worked through night and rain, and 17 hours later, the entire site had been cleared. Many who worked in the rescue were overcome with shock as one survivor recounted; \\"Daddy worked so long he almost had a nervous breakdown. As long as he was working he was fine, but as soon as he came home and sat down he'd start shaking.\\" Buildings in the neighboring communities of Henderson, Overton, Kilgore and as far away as Tyler and Longview were converted into makeshift first aid tents and morgues to house the enormous number of bodies, and everything from family cars to delivery trucks served as hearses and ambulances. A new hospital, Mother Frances Hospital in Tyler, was scheduled to open the next day, but the dedication was canceled and the hospital opened immediately.http://www.tmfhs.org/history.php Reporters who arrived in the city found themselves swept up in the rescue effort. Former Dallas Times Herald executive editor Felix McKnight, then a young AP reporter, recalled, \\"We identified ourselves and were immediately told that helpers were needed far more than reporters.\\" Walter Cronkite also found himself in New London on one of his first assignments for UPI. Although Cronkite went on to cover World War II and the Nuremberg trials, he was quoted as saying decades later, \\"I did nothing in my studies nor in my life to prepare me for a story of the magnitude of that New London tragedy, nor has any story since that awful day equaled it.\\"  Victims  Of the more than 600 people in the school, only about 130 escaped without serious injury. Estimates of the number of dead vary from 296 to 319, but that number could be much higher as many of the residents of New London at the time were transient oilfield workers, and there is no way to determine how many volunteers collected the bodies of their children in the days following the disaster and returned them to their respective homes for burial. Of the deceased the majority were from grades 5 through 11 as the younger students were educated in a separate building and most had already been dismissed from school. The majority of the victims of the explosion are buried at Pleasant Hill Cemetery, near New London, with an entire section being designated for the victims. It was thought that one mother had a heart attack and died when she found out that her daughter died, with only part of her face, her chin and a couple of bones recovered, but this story was found to be untrue when both mother and daughter were found alive.Gone at 3:17: The Untold Story of the Worst School Disaster in American History Kindle Edition, David Brown and Michael Wereschagin = Identification = Most of the bodies were either burned beyond recognition, or blown to pieces. Most were identified by clothing or personal items, such as a boy who was identified by the presence of the pull string from his favorite shirt in his jeans pocket. A student survivor recounted being in a makeshift morgue: \\"I saw fathers fight over dead children like dogs over a bone, yelling 'That's mine!' 'No, mine!' I saw children who looked like roadkill, you couldn't tell if it was a boy, girl, or what.\\" Fingerprinting experts were brought in to take fingerprints from bodies that were disfigured by the explosion. This method of identification was available as many of the surrounding area had been fingerprinted at the Texas Centennial Exposition the previous summer. Aftermath The surviving gymnasium was quickly converted into multiple classrooms. Inside tents and modified buildings, classes resumed ten days later, with the thirty surviving seniors completing the school year in the gymnasium. A new school was completed on the property in 1939 directly behind the location of the destroyed building. The school remained known as the London School until 1965 when London Independent School District consolidated with Gaston Independent School District, the name was changed to West Rusk High School, and the mascot was changed to the Raiders. A lawsuit was brought against the school district and the Parade Gasoline Company, but the court ruled that neither could be held responsible. Superintendent W. C. Shaw was forced to resign amid talk of a lynching; he had lost a son, a niece and nephew in the explosion.https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1937/03/20/118967356.pdf Adolf Hitler, who was the German Chancellor at the time, paid his respects in the form of a telegram, a copy of which is on display at the London Museum.Per the History Channel's Modern Marvels series = Investigation and legislation = Experts from the United States Bureau of Mines concluded that the connection to the residue gas line was faulty. The connection had allowed gas to leak into the school, and since natural gas is invisible and is odorless, the leak was unnoticed. The sanding machine's switch is believed to have caused a spark that ignited the gas-air mixture. To reduce the damage of future leaks, the Texas Legislature began mandating within weeks of the explosion that thiols (mercaptans) be added to natural gas. The strong odor of many thiols makes leaks quickly detectable. The practice quickly spread worldwide. Shortly after the disaster, the Texas Legislature met in emergency session and enacted the Engineering Registration Act (now rewritten as the Texas Engineering Practice Act). Public pressure was on the government to regulate the practice of engineering due to the faulty installation of the natural gas connection; Carolyn Jones, a nine-year-old survivor, spoke to the Texas Legislature about the importance of safety in schools. The use of the title \\"engineer\\" in Texas remains legally restricted to those who have been professionally certified by the state to practice engineering. Remembrance The top of the London School cenotaph by sculptor Matchett Herring Coe London Museum A large granite cenotaph on the median of Texas State Highway 42 across from the school site, erected in 1939, commemorates the disaster. Over the years, the New London School explosion received surprisingly little attention, given the magnitude of the event. Explanations for this are speculative, but most center around residents' unwillingness to discuss the tragedy. L. V. Barber said of his father Lonnie, \\"I can remember newspaper people coming around every now and then, asking him questions about that day, but he never had much to say.\\" A former student mentioned in 2007; \\"People were afraid to talk about it; almost no family in this community was unaffected, and whenever people would tell us about the explosion it would be sort of in whispers and don't say anything in front of so-and-so because they lost a sister.\\" In recent years, as the disaster has gained historical perspective, it has been increasingly covered by researchers and journalists. The 50th anniversary of the event, in 1987, was commemorated in part by the release of a documentary, The Day A Generation Died, written, produced, and directed by Jerry Gumbert. In 1998, The London Museum and Tea House, across the highway from the school site, opened. Its first curator, Mollie Ward, was an explosion survivor. In March 2012, survivors and others gathered together at the town's rebuilt school in remembrance of the 75th anniversary of the disaster.  Popular culture and media  In 1973, Texas filmmaker Michael Brown produced a half- hour documentary on the explosion thought to be the first ever made on the subject. Called New London: The Day the Clock Stood Still, the film features survivors of the blast and their recollections of that day. In 2007, the Texas-based folk band JamisonPriest released \\"Lost Generation (The New London Song)\\" to commemorate this event.http://www.jamisonpriest.com/ In 2008, some of the last living survivors of the explosion shared their personal stories of their experience with documentary filmmaker and East Texas native Kristin Beauchamp. The feature-length documentary, When Even Angels Wept, was released in 2009. It is told almost exclusively by survivors and eyewitnesses. They share what they experienced on the afternoon leading up to the blast to what it was like to spend days searching East Texas towns, hospitals and morgues for missing loved ones. A one-act play about the event, written by Dr. Bobby H. Johnson, a journalist and Professor Emeritus of history at Stephen F. Austin State University, called A Texas Tragedy,Johnson, Bobby H.(2012), A Texas Tragedy. Stephen F. Austin University Press has been performed by students at Huntington High School in Huntington and in other regional venues. In 2012, Texas filmmaker Michael Brown began work on a new documentary about the east Texas oil field discovery and its eventual role in the New London School disaster. The film, scheduled for completion by spring of 2013 and carrying a working title of Shadow Across The Path, features excerpts from an hour-long interview that Brown conducted with Walter Cronkite in his New York office at CBS. The interview has never been seen or published. The New London school explosion was then-20-year-old Cronkite's first national story.

It quickly grew in importance and was an important and influential magazine in its subject matter from the late 1970s through the mid-1980s. The magazine is no longer published, but the rights holders maintain a web presence using its final title Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer. History The Space Gamer (TSG) started out as a digest quarterly publication of the brand new Metagaming Concepts company in March 1975. Howard M. Thompson, the owner of Metagaming, and the first editor of the magazine, stated \\"The magazine had been planned for after our third or fourth game but circumstances demand we do it now\\"\\"Where We're Going\\", Howard Thompson, The Space Gamer, Number 1 (Metagaming, 1975) (after their first game, Stellar Conquest). Initial issues were in a plain-paper digest format. By issue 17, it had grown to a full size bimonthly magazine, printed on slick paper. When Steve Jackson departed Metagaming to found his own company, he also secured the right to publish The Space Gamer from number 27 on. In the first Steve Jackson Games (SJG) issue Howard Thompson wrote a report on Metagaming and stated \\"Metagaming's staff won't miss the effort. After the change in ownership Metagaming feels comfortable with the decision; it was the right thing to do.\\"\\"Metagaming Report\\", Howard Thompson, The Space Gamer, Number 27 (SJG, March‚ÄìApril 1980) In the same issue, Steve Jackson announced, \\"TSG is going monthly.... from [number 28 (May 1980)] on, it'll be a monthly magazine.\\"\\"Where We're Going\\", Steve Jackson, The Space Gamer, Number 27 (SJG, March‚ÄìApril 1980) The magazine stayed with SJG for the next five years, during which it was at its most popular and influential. In 1983, the magazine was split into two separate bimonthly magazines published in alternating months: Space Gamer (losing the definite article with the split in Number 64), and Fantasy Gamer; the former concentrating entirely on science fiction, and the latter on fantasy. This arrangement lasted about a year. Fantasy Gamer ran six issues before being folded back into Space Gamer: > You see, we were churning out magazines - Space Gamer, Fantasy Gamer, Fire & > Movement, and Autoduel Quarterly - at the rate of two a month!... We had to > find some way to preserve what little sanity we had left. The best way to do > this was to merge Space Gamer and Fantasy Gamer.... As it has for the past > year, Space Gamer will appear bimonthly, giving us the time to get some > games done, as well.\\"Counter Intelligence\\", Warren Spector, Space Gamer, > Number 70 (SJG, July/Aug 1984) Like Metagaming before it, the effort of producing a magazine became greater than its publisher was willing to bear. The change to bimonthly publication was not enough to allow SJG to focus on new games as they wished, and in 1985, it was announced, \\"We've sold Space Gamer. We'll still be heavily involved‚Äîbut SJ Games won't be the publisher any longer. Giving up SG is definitely traumatic... but it gives us the time to do other things, especially GURPS\\".\\"Where We're Going\\", Steve Jackson, Space Gamer, Number 76 (SJG, Sept/Oct 1985) The magazine had been sold to Diverse Talents, Incorporated (DTI). They initially had it as a section in their own magazine The VIP of Gaming, but it soon became a separate publication again with the previous numbering and format, but with the name Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer. Space Gamer ceased publication in September 1985. Since that time, it has gone through a number of owners, all keeping the final name, but occasionally restarting the numbering. Eventually, Better Games, now renamed Space Gamer, bought the magazine, and has kept the title alive by reinventing it through the net. In 2010 Steve Jackson Games started republishing back issues in PDF format. Editors Metagaming * Howard Thompson: #1 (copyright 1975) ‚Äì #5 (Mar./May 1976) * C.

It was published in the 1990 Tolkien Calendar. Ted Nasmith (born 1956) is a Canadian artist, illustrator and architectural renderer. He is best known as an illustrator of J. R. R. Tolkien's works -- The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion. Nasmith was born in Goderich, Ontario, Canada. As the son of a Royal Canadian Air Force officer, Nasmith's childhood was characterized by a series of moves, chiefly when his father was stationed in eastern France when Ted was 2 years old, until the family returned to Ontario 3 years later. By the time Nasmith became a teenager, they had settled in Don Mills, a suburb of Toronto (he now resides in nearby Newmarket.) Nasmith's public school guidance counselor encouraged him to enter a high school which featured a 4-year commercial art program. During his third year of high school, however, Nasmith's sister introduced him to The Lord of the Rings, and it quickly became a huge inspiration and focus in his life. Nasmith writes: > \\"It opened up in me a dormant love of lost and misty times, myth and legend. > Not since childhood had I felt such a sense of 'home', unaware of the > effects the intervening years had had in displacing it. I began immediately > to draw scenes inspired by this magical, nostalgic realm, becoming absorbed > for many hours at a time.\\" (Nasmith 2002) In 1972, Nasmith mailed photographs of some of his paintings to J. R. R. Tolkien. Tolkien responded by letter a few weeks later, both praising the work and making the comment that the rendition of Bilbo Baggins seemed a little too childlike. Still a teenager at the time, this early feedback from Tolkien encouraged Nasmith to strive for a more literal interpretation of Tolkien's works. After graduation, Nasmith aspired to follow in the footsteps of automotive illustrator Art Fitzpatrick. However, since photography was replacing illustration in the business of car advertising, he instead found employment as an architectural renderer, showing a particular flair for the intense realism such illustrations often demand. Nasmith's Tolkien artwork, which echoes the luminist landscapes and Victorian neoclassical styles, eventually caught the attention of Tolkien's publishers, who included four of his paintings in the 1987 Tolkien Calendar. His artwork continued to appear in these beloved calendars over the years, including several where he is the sole featured artist (1987, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2009, 2010). In October 1996, Nasmith was asked by Tolkien's publishers to provide the artwork for the first illustrated edition of The Silmarillion, during which time Ted developed a strong working relationship with Christopher Tolkien. The illustrated edition was published in 1998; in 2004, a second edition () was published featuring many more paintings by Nasmith. In early 1999, representatives for Peter Jackson and New Line Cinema invited Ted Nasmith to join John Howe and Alan Lee to work on conceptual art for The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. According to Nasmith, > \\"They invited me to be there with the others in New Zealand to help with > conceptual art, and made me a nice offer. However, I was going through a > personal crisis unrelated to my art, and in the end, being that it would > also force me to abandon my freelance obligations and be away indefinitely, > I reluctantly declined, settling the question in my mind after very careful > deliberation.\\" (Nasmith 2004) Nasmith is also considered a Tolkien scholar, well-read in ancient history, religion, and other areas. He has been a prominent member of two Tolkien- related organizations -- the Tolkien Society, and the Mythopoeic Society -- and has long subscribed to Mensa's Tolkien journal, Beyond Bree. Nasmith is a songwriter, guitarist and tenor. Much of his musical work is likewise inspired by Tolkien's writings. His first commercial album, The Hidden Door: Songs in the Key of Enchantment, was released in 2007. He has also worked on a musical project entitled Beren and L√∫thien: A Song Cycle, with his friend Alex Lewis, and has a close friendship with one of the founders of The Tolkien Ensemble. In latter years, he has illustrated a deluxe 2-volume limited edition of George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones novel. It took about three years to complete the set of over 80 illustrations, most in pencil, with six in colour. He also is among the illustrators of the book The World of Ice and Fire, an encyclopedia of the fantasy realms featured in George R.R. Martin's epic novels. Ted worked closely with the Ice and Fire author to design castles according to the author's specifications. They were featured in the 2011 Song of Ice and Fire calendar, too. Nasmith was commissioned by the video game developer Turbine and later Standing Stone Games to create the 'key art' of the major updates for the online game based on Tolkien's work, The Lord of the Rings Online in 2015 and 2017. His artwork is being used as promotional materials, on the website and within the game as loading screens, notably for the Mordor expansion in 2017. See also *Works inspired by J. R. R.

He is the chief executive officer (CEO) and founder of Dreamhaven, located in Irvine, California. Morhaime is best known as the co-founder and the former president of Blizzard Entertainment, a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, Inc., that was founded in 1991 as Silicon & Synapse. He served on the Vivendi Games executive committee since January 1999, when Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. became a subsidiary of Vivendi Games.  Early life and education  Morhaime graduated from Granada Hills High School in 1985. He is also an alumnus of Triangle Fraternity and received his bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering in 1990 from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). In sixth grade, Morhaime, along with his brother and sister, purchased a video game console called the Bally Professional Arcade, first released in 1978. Morhaime discovered that the console was programmable and he figured out how to write simple games on it, building off of example programming code he found in a gaming newsletter. As an electrical engineering student at UCLA, Morhaime focused more on hardware than on software. \\"I procrastinated a lot,\\" he admitted. ‚ÄúLA Times Interview with Michael Morhaime, all quotations from this source‚Äù Retrieved on 30 September 2017. Things changed after he got an internship at a San Jose microchip company. In his internship, he learned about circuit design, and when he returned to school he was ahead of his computer architecture class. \\"I used to be the guy that sat in the back,\\" he said, but after his stint in Silicon Valley, he said, \\"I started sitting up front.\\"  Career  Blizzard Entertainment = It was in that time period at UCLA that Morhaime met the two other people with whom he would create Silicon & Synapse, the company that would be renamed later as Blizzard Entertainment. The initial founders‚ÄîMorhaime, Allen Adham and Frank Pearce‚Äîrented a small office in Irvine, California, where the proximity to other companies was hoped to be advantageous to them. In 1995, Blizzard released Warcraft II, its first number one selling game. \\"It's probably the game that put Blizzard on the map,\\" Morhaime said. Besides its large number of sales, \\"it was the first game you could play over the Internet with a good experience,\\" which was a novelty at the time, as well as being a defining selling point for its later titles. Blizzard's greatest success came with a hard but not unwelcome lesson. In planning for the release of World of Warcraft (WoW) in late 2004, Morhaime thought that the market for the much larger and more interactive new game‚Äîthe first in their history to require players to pay a monthly subscription fee‚Äîwould grow slowly and would be an unpopular surprise to the gaming community. \\"We felt it was very likely the fee would be a deterrent for people, and that WoW would not sell as quickly as some of our previous games,\\" he said. All of Blizzard's production and marketing decisions were based on that assumption. To Blizzard's surprise (and very shortly later, terror) WoW sold extremely quickly, leaving the underprepared Blizzard unable to keep merchants supplied with the game for a short time. \\"For the whole first year, we scrambled to keep up with demand,\\" he said. \\"It probably took years off of our lives.\\" World of Warcraft had approximately 11 million subscribers as of 2010. In 2017, Morhaime earned $12.3 million as the CEO of Blizzard. On October 3, 2018, Morhaime announced he was stepping down as the company president and CEO, instead becoming an advisor to the company. Morhaime was replaced by J. Allen Brack, the executive producer on World of Warcraft. His advisory role concluded on April 7, 2019. = Dreamhaven = In 2020, Mike Morhaime founded Dreamhaven, a new video game company. The company is based in Irvine, California, and has two game development studios called Secret Door and Moonshot Games. Dreamhaven, Inc. operates under Moonwell Studios LLC.  Honors and awards  In 2008, Morhaime was inducted into the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences' Hall of Fame. On the same year, Morhaime was honored at the 59th Annual Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards for Blizzard's creation of World of Warcraft. Along with Don Daglow of Stormfront Studios and John Carmack of id Software, Morhaime is one of only three designers or producers to accept awards at the Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards and at the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Interactive Achievement Awards. Morhaime received the national Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award in the Technology category in 2012.Ernst & Young Engineer Of The Year Award winner , ey.com; accessed 2016-07-99. In 2019, Morhaime was appointed the 2019 Honor Award at the Gamelab Barcelona, in Spain for his success in the gaming industry. Morhaime plays poker and reached second place in edition 2006 of DICE's Celebrity Poker Tournament. In the last round, he faced Scott Fischman and Perry Friedman (World Series of Poker professionals), and Ray Muzyka, co- founder and CEO of video game developer BioWare. After a 45-minute game, Muzyka won, and Morhaime placed second overall in the tournament.  Multimedia  In 2012, Morhaime made a cameo appearance on The Guild, a web series about the lives of a gamers' online experiences with an MMORPG that draws references to World of Warcraft. He is known for his work with the gaming community, but also worked on the 2016 film Warcraft: The Beginning.  Personal life  In 2010, Mike married his long-time girlfriend Amy Chen. In 2017, Mike bought a mansion in a gated Rancho Mirage community in Riverside County, California for $2.25 million. He is a member of ETC, a metal band formed of and by Blizzard employees, where he plays bass guitar.

This, along with its scenery and many beaches, has made the area a popular tourist destination, especially with visitors from Northern Ireland. Gweedore and the neighbouring districts of Cloughaneely and the Rosses are collectively known locally as \\"the three parishes\\"; they form a social and cultural region distinct from the rest of the county, with Gweedore serving as the main centre for socialising and industry. Etymology Gweedore natives pictured here in Magheraclogher in 1865 Men fishing with Errigal in the background Gweedore is the anglicisation of the original and official Irish name Gaoth Dobhair. Gaoth refers to an inlet of the sea at the mouth of the Crolly River, known as An Ghaoth. It is the boundary between Gweedore to the north and The Rosses to the south. Dobhar is an old Irish word for water. Therefore, Gaoth Dobhair translates as \\"the aqueous estuary\\".Logainmneacha Ghaoth Dobhair The name Gweedore or Gaoth Dobhair refers to the traditional district and Catholic parish of the same name, not to one village or town. The villages of Bunbeg, Derrybeg, Dunlewey and others are collectively known as Gweedore. Language Gweedore has a population of 4,500 and is divided into three District Electoral Divisions (E.D.s) or wards: *Machaire Chlochair with a population of 2,651 and an estimated 77% native Irish speakers. *Cnoc Fola/M√≠n an Chladaigh with a population of 1,326 and 83% Irish speakers. *D√∫n L√∫iche with a population of 695 and 76% Irish speakers.

A view of Gweedore from Bloody Foreland Since most of the inhabitants of the village are bilingual, it is common to hear English vocabulary used within an Irish sentence and vice versa. A rich subset of unique vocabulary and phrases has arisen from this bilingualism and owing to this, the parish has attracted some curious interest from both lexicographers and etymologists in the past. For example, the Irish suffix -ailte or -e√°ilte is used to form a Gaelicised version of English verbs, as in wreckailte \\"tired\\". History Magheragallon Cemetery, Derrybeg The Plantation of Ulster in 1609 added a twist to the fate of the parish. Irish-speaking families who were driven from their fertile lands in the Lagan Valley and the surrounding areas made their way to the poor boglands of west Donegal. Some of them made it as far as Gweedore and could go no further west. Around the same time, English and Scottish colonists began to arrive when this uncharted territory was converted to baronies. It appears the parish was very sparsely populated up until the 17th century. The first people to arrive lived on the islands or by the shore in clusters, pockets of houses built close together and in each other's shade. Up until the early 19th century the parish was only lightly populated and it seems the people had an amicable relationship with the landowners.Gweedore Donegal The standard of life was to deteriorate with the arrival of new landlords in the 19th century, in particular Lord George Hill (1801‚Äì1879) and his son Arthur. The people of the parish led by James McFadden (), the parish priest in 1875‚Äì1901, challenged the landlords with the founding of the Land League and the Plan of Campaign. The killing by parishioners of Royal Irish Constabulary District Inspector William Limbrick Martin (locally known as An Mh√°irt√≠nigh) outside the local church, Teach Phobail Mhuire, in Derrybeg on Sunday 3 February 1889, while rushing Father McFadden with a drawn sword, was the climax of the Land War in Gweedore.History of Gweedore, Chapter One The case was recalled in the 1928 memoirs of Tim Healy, who defended Father McFadden and his parishioners.Healy memoirs online, chapter 22 An Irish American journalist, W.H. Hurlbert, also investigated the landlord-tenant dispute in Gweedore in minute detail in his book Ireland under Coercion, published in 1888.Hurlbert W vol.1, pp.66‚Äì122 online text Many books have been published in Irish, and several in English, detailing Gweedore's rich history. One of the most prolific of local historians was C√°it Nic Giolla Bhr√≠de.Coisc√©im 1996 =Freak storm= On the afternoon of 23 June 2009, a severe thunderstorm struck Gweedore. It was centred on the adjoining villages of Bunbeg and Derrybeg, and lasted for several hours, causing two rivers to burst their banks, flooding houses, shops and factories, ripping up roads and destroying bridges. Lightning which lasted for two hours damaged power lines and caused a major breakdown of mobile phone service, leaving people trapped by the floods unable to contact help. Up to 20 houses were cut off from the outside world after three access bridges were carried away by the swollen rivers. Donegal Democrat report on flash flood in Gweedore, 24 June 2009 Described as the worst storm \\"in living memory\\", it was also the most severe since 1880 when five people drowned in Derrybeg.

However, by 2001 most of these companies had closed due to competition from Eastern Europe. Up to 4,000 jobs were lost, and this had a serious economic and social effect on Gweedore and surrounding areas. The factory in the townland of Crolly has been manufacturing porcelain dolls since 1939 under the name Crolly Dolls.Crolly Dolls history In 2003, the estate was renamed P√°irc Ghn√≥ Ghaoth Dobhair (Gweedore Business Park) and the Gaeltacht body, √ödar√°s na Gaeltachta, started a campaign to try to entice businesses to Gweedore in hope of reviving the local economy.

The High Court held that the judicial power of the Commonwealth could not be vested in a tribunal that also exercised non-judicial functions. It is a major case dealing with the separation of powers in Australian law. BackgroundSeparation of Powers= The High Court had consistently held that the judicial power of the Commonwealth could not be exercised by any body except a court established under Chapter III of the Constitution or a state court invested with federal jurisdiction. This was because the separation of judicial and other powers was a fundamental principle of the Constitution. The High Court had held that the separation of powers did not prevent a Federal court or Federal judge from discharging other functions. Latham CJ stated that: > Thus, in my opinion, it is not possible to rely upon any doctrine of > absolute separation of powers for the purpose of establishing a universal > proposition that no court or person who discharges Federal judicial > functions can lawfully discharge any other function which has been entrusted > to him by statute. This proposition, however, does not involve the further > proposition that any powers or duties, of any description whatsoever, may be > conferred or imposed upon Federal courts or Federal judges. If a power or > duty were in its nature such as to be inconsistent with the co-existence of > judicial power, it might well be held that a statutory provision purporting > to confer or impose such a power or duty could not stand with the creation > of the judicial tribunal or the appointment of a person to act as a member > of it. The power of the Arbitration Court was contained in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 which relevantly provided that: > 29\\\\. The Court shall have power- > > (b) to order compliance with an order or award proved to the satisfaction of > the Court to have been broken or not observed > > (c) by order, to enjoin an organization or person from committing or > continuing a contravention of this Act or a breach or non-observance of an > order or award; > > 29A (1) The Court has the same power to punish contempts of its power and > authority, whether in relation to its judicial powers and functions or > otherwise, as is possessed by the High Court in respect of contempts of the > High Court. amended by . =Facts= The Metal Trades Award was made by a conciliation commissioner on 16 January 1952 and included a prohibition on industrial action as follows: > (ba) (i) No organization party to this award shall in any way, whether > directly or indirectly be a party to or concerned in any ban, limitation or > restriction upon the performance of work in accordance with this award. > (ii) An organization shall be deemed to commit a new and separate breach of > the above sub-clause on each and every day in which it is directly or > indirectly a party to such ban, limitation or restriction.Metal Trades Award > (1952) 73 CAR 325 at p 442 (16 January 1952) Commonwealth Court of > Conciliation and Arbitration. Members of the Federated Ironworkers Association (FIA) at the Morts Dock at Balmain, including FIA delegate Nick Origlass, went on strike from 16 February 1955 seeking an increase in pay of A¬£1 per week. Other workers were supporting the strikers by paying a levy of 8 shillings per week. The strike was portrayed by the Communist Party of Australia as a contest between the union members and the National Secretary of the , Laurie Short, who was a grouper, part of the informal Industrial Groups set up by the Labor Party within trade unions to counter the perceived threat of Communist Party influence. The Arbitration Court made orders against the requiring it to comply with the Metal Trades Award.Metal Trades Employers Association v Federated Ironworkers Association (1955) 80 CAR 325 (23 March 1955) Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The strike continued and on 20 May 1955 the FIA was found to be in contempt of court despite genuine attempts to have the employees return to work. No fine was imposed; however, the FIA had to pay legal costs of 160 guineas.Metal Trades Employers Association v Federated Ironworkers Association (1955) 81 CAR 102 (20 May 1955) Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. =Prior actions= The cargo ship MV Poul Carl Members of the Boilermakers' Society of Australia were among those supporting the strikers by paying the levy of 8 shillings per week. They also put a ban on repair work on the cargo ship Poul Carl, and the Metal Trades Employers Association sought an order requiring the Boilermakers to comply with the Metal Trades Award. On 21 May 1955 the Arbitration Court, Kirby, Dunphy and Ashburner JJ, held that it had no alternative but to make the orders.Breach of award: Metal Trades Employers Association v Boilermakers Society of Australia (1955) 81 CAR 112 (31 May 1955) Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The Boilermakers were subsequently found to be in contempt of court by permitting its members to contribute \\"strike pay\\", thereby actively subsidising the strike and prolonging it. The Boilermakers were fined A¬£500 and ordered to pay the employers' legal costs.Contempt of court: Metal Trades Employers Association v Boilermakers Society of Australia (1955) 81 CAR 231 (28 June 1955) Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. =The High Court application= The Boilermakers applied to the High Court for a writ of prohibition compelling Kirby, Dunphy and Ashburner and the Metal Trades Employers Association, to appear before the High Court to show cause why they should not be prohibited from further proceeding on orders.A writ of prohibition is one of the prerogative writs, which are traditionally brought in the name of the Monarch and the person who must show cause is named as the defendant. In this usage ex parte means 'on the application of' rather than its other use as a case heard in the absence of a party. Thus the case name means the Queen (R) v the defendants (the judges and employers' association); on the application of (ex parte) the Boilermakers. The order to show cause is a rule nisi, and if prohibition is granted, the rule is made absolute. The Boilermakers challenged the orders on the grounds that sections of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act were invalid in that the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was given non-judicial powers (administrative, arbitral, executive and legislative powers) as well as judicial powers and the separation of powers in Chapter III of the Constitution meant that the same body could not exercise judicial and non-judicial powers. Eggleston appeared for the Boilermakers. Menzies appeared for the Arbitration Court and the Attorney-General. Macfarlan appeared for the Metal Trades Employers Association. Judgment of the High Court The High Court held that the judicial power of the Commonwealth could not be vested in a tribunal that also exercised non-judicial functions. It is a major case dealing with the separation of powers in Australian law. =Grant of both judicial and non- judicial powers= Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Fullagar and Kitto JJ held that is was: > impossible to escape the conviction that Chap. III does not allow the > exercise of a jurisdiction which of its very nature belongs to the judicial > power of the Commonwealth by a body established for purposes foreign to the > judicial power, notwithstanding that it is organized as a court and in a > manner which might otherwise satisfy ss. 71 and 72, and that Chap. III does > not allow a combination with judicial power of functions which are not > ancillary or incidental to its exercise but are foreign to it. There were three key elements to the majority decision # The constitution embodied the separation of judicial power from legislative and executive power; # Chapter III & matters incidental thereto were the sole source of power for a federal court or judge; and # The arbitration power was foreign to the judicial power. Each of the dissenting judges took a slightly different approach. Williams J agreed that only a court could exercise judicial power, but held that there was no express prohibition on a court exercising non- judicial powers, rejecting an \\"implication in the Constitution arising from the vague concept of the separation of powers\\". Webb J held that the Constitution should be interpreted liberally and the previous decisions of the High Court should be followed. Taylor J saw difficulties in defining or identifying judicial functions, including the overlapping powers or functions that could not be clearly defined as exclusively legislative, executive or judicial. (1958) 2 Sydney Law Review 480. =Is it the grant of judicial or of non-judicial powers which fails= The majority, Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Fullagar and Kitto JJ, held simply that the Arbitration Court was \\"a tribunal established and equipped primarily and predominantly for the work of industrial conciliation and arbitration\\" and thus held it was the attachment of powers of judicial enforcement that were invalid. Williams J held that if the combination of powers was not permissible, it would be the arbitral functions that would be invalid. Webb J took a different approach, holding that while judicial power could only be exercised by judges, the arbitral functions could be exercised by anyone, including by individuals who happened to be judges, referred to as persona designata. Taylor J did not address this issue. Privy Council On 1 June 1956 the Attorney General obtained leave to appeal to the Privy Council, and was represented by the Solicitor-General, Bailey . The Boilermakers filed submissions by Eggleston , however they did not appear at the hearing.; The advice of the Privy Council was delivered by Viscount Simonds. The Privy Council largely followed the reasoning of the majority of the High Court. > The question in whatever for it is stated is whether and how far judicial > and non-judicial power can be united in the same body. Their Lordships do > not doubt that the decision of the High Court is right and that there is > nothing in Chap. III, to which alone recourse can be had, which justifies > such a union. The Privy Council concluded that \\"The true criterion is not what powers are expressly or by implication excluded from the scope of Chapter III but what powers are expressly or by implication included in it\\". Aftermath The significance of the case was that it restricted the use of judicial power only to Chapter III courts (under the Australian Constitution), as well as establishing that these courts could exercise no other power. In this way, it clarified the separation of powers doctrine in Australia. The decision led to the abolition of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and the creation of two new Australian industrial relations bodies: the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission (later known as the Australian Industrial Relations Commission), whose limited-term members could create industrial awards and settle interstate industrial disputes, and the Commonwealth Industrial Court, whose judges could interpret and enforce awards made by the Commission. There are few Privy Council decisions about the Australian Constitution that are cited in the High Court. While the decision in Boilermakers is often cited, it is High Court decision that is cited, with the notation that it was affirmed by the Privy Council.eg .

Founded in 1870 by Louis C. Graeter, the company has since expanded to 50 retail locations selling ice cream, candy and baked goods in the Midwestern United States. It further distributes its ice cream to 6,000 stores throughout the country. As of 2017, the company had 1,050 employees and $60 million in revenue. Graeter, the son of German immigrants, opened the first ice cream shop for the business in 1870 in Cincinnati's Pendleton neighborhood which quickly gained a following. Growing with the advent of the premium ice cream market in the decades after, the company has been managed by four successive generations of the Graeter family, expanding its retail shops to Columbus, Louisville and other cities. Deals with major supermarket chains including Kroger have brought Graeter's Ice Cream to more than 6,200 grocery stores nationwide as well. The ice cream maker is known for its \\"French pot\\" process that produces denser than average ice cream. Its national recognition for this ice cream grew over time, in particular after Oprah Winfrey declared it the best ice cream she had ever tasted in 2002. Since then, a number of celebrities and media publications have commented on the ice cream brand's quality. History First generation = Graeter's was founded in 1870 by Louis Charles Graeter, who was of German ancestry, with his wife, Anna. At first, he sold the ice cream at the Court Street Market at the base of Sycamore Hill in Cincinnati's Pendleton neighborhood. At the time, ice cream was considered a novelty, but the business quickly gained a following in the neighborhood. The business established a storefront on Sycamore Street. By 1883, the business employed three men and had two wagons delivering ice cream. Around that time, though, Louis Graeter stepped away from the business, taking $1,000 and leaving it in debt. His brother, Fred Graeter, maintained the business after Anna left, bringing it out of debt. Louis Graeter spent time in Stockton, California, where he remarried for a time and eventually returned to Cincinnati around 1900. It was around this time that the ice cream business began producing its product in French pots. Louis Graeter married a third time, to Regina Berger, the daughter of a prominent Cincinnati businessman with a strong reputation in the community. Together, Graeter and his new wife set up a home at 967 East McMillan St. in the Walnut Hills neighborhood, producing and selling ice cream on the bottom floor of the property. = Second generation = Louis Charles died in 1919 at 67 after being hit by a streetcar, and his wife took over the business while continuing to raise their two sons, Wilmer and Paul. It was at this time that she sought to expand the business, growing the size of the McMillan Street location and opening a second location on Walnut Street in downtown Cincinnati, followed by a third at 2704 Erie Ave. in the Hyde Park neighborhood. By 1929, the shop had locations in Norwood, Madisonville, Avondale and Pleasant Ridge as well. In order to support the volume of ice cream being produced, the business in 1937 opened an ice cream and chocolate production plant in a former printing press facility on Reading Road in Mount Auburn. While business remained steady through the Great Depression, the shop faced challenges during World War II thanks to the nationwide rationing of sugar, as well as lack of available manpower. But the shop grew with the population boom brought about following the war, and it opened new locations in Oakley, East End and Bond Hill, following suburban sprawl in those areas. Still, it closed other store locations as demographic shifts prompted relocation of business. Following World War II, and with new manufacturing processes and the proliferation of the refrigerator, Graeter's faced challenges from competitors who could mass- produce ice cream. Among its competitors was Aglamesis Bro's, another family- owned business opened in Cincinnati, as well as United Dairy Farmers, which grew quickly. Graeter's and Algamesis Bros., in particular, are routinely considered to be rivals in Cincinnati, though the companies are different in size and the style of ice cream they make is different. The invention of soft serve also allowed large national chains like Dairy Queen, Carvel and Tastee- Freez to grow as well. During this time, the shop began operating a bakery with an increasing variety of goods as an added service, and stopped selling toys and other novelties. = Third generation = Regina Graeter died in 1955. Wilmer bought Paul out of the business, causing some tension within the family. Wilmer's sons, Dick, Lou and Jon were brought in to help with the business. Younger sister Kathy would become involved some years later as well, though another sister, Carol, never worked for the company beyond childhood. The ice cream business slowly gained traction and local popularity through the 1960s. The shops began selling pints that could be taken home. In this time, it faced particular competition from higher-quality brands with more flavors of ice cream sold in pints that could be taken home, including Baskin-Robbins, H√§agen-Dazs and Ben & Jerry's. Still, the company maintained a strong following in Cincinnati in the 1970s and 1980s that prevented these brands from making as strong a retail presence in Cincinnati. Graeter's first began selling pints of ice cream to stores in the 1970s, most notably a shop in Washington Market Park in the TriBeCa neighborhood of New York City, though pints there sold for $8.85, compared to $2.50 at Graeter's own Cincinnati stores. In 1987, a deal with Kroger allowed Graeter's to sell its ice cream inside the supermarket chain. Eventually, its distribution grew to over 2,000 Kroger stores. Graeter's has been marketed in some of Kroger's other brands as well, notably including King Soopers in Colorado. With these deals it has sought to build a national brand awareness and can now be bought in retail stores in 48 states. In some cases this has been successful, such as in Denver where, after a few weeks after introducing 12 flavors, the company was selling 5 gallons of ice cream a week. Still, the business saw limited growth in the 1980s, primarily because of the popularity of frozen yogurt, in chains like TCBY, brought an appeal for healthier frozen desserts. In this time it also invested in new equipment as well, first testing equipment from Cincinnati- based Alvey Washing Equipment before trying equipment created by Italian company Carpigiani, but eventually opted to bring its \\"French Pot\\" production in-house, though it did not patent the equipment. = Fourth generation = By 1989, the company produced 100,000 gallons of ice cream annually and generated $5 million a year in revenue. Jon Graeter retired from the business after an accident that year, and Kathy was brought into the business, as were Bob, Chip and Rich Graeter, sons of Lou and Dick respectively and the fourth generation of the family in the business. Wilmer died in 1991. However, undertaking succession planning with the help of University of Cincinnati experts, the business wasn't fully transferred to the fourth generation for over a decade. Graeter's built a $2 million expansion onto its Reading Road production facility that doubled the building in size to in 1994, borrowing $1 million in the process but adding production space for ice cream, candy and more storage. After 1994, the chain began shipping pints of ice cream outside of its store footprint as well, using dry ice-packed containers via United Parcel Service, which allowed it to ship anywhere in the United States. By 2010 this was generating $3 million a year in business, with the largest number of shipments being made to California. The business incrementally began allowing its ice cream to be sold in restaurants in country clubs as well. Once the fourth generation took the business full-time at the end of 2003, it subsequently undertook a rebranding process rolling out a new logo designed by Libby, Perszyk, Kathman Inc., stronger marketing and a more cohesive strategic direction. They also began to substantially increase production with the new plant, growing from 100,000 gallons a year in 1989 to 200,000 gallons in 2004. Design Forum, a retail design firm, handled updates to Graeter's shops. The plant expansion increased capacity over 40 percent after 2004, allowing it to grow its wholesale business. With these tools, its leaders and franchise owners reported business was not significantly impacted by the Great Recession in 2008 or 2009. At the time it was doing about $20 million a year in sales. In 2009 the company announced plans to build a new plant in Bond Hill to allow it to continue to grow production. The company bought the land for a marginal number, borrowed $10 million from the city with interest rates to be repaid over 20 years, receiving $3.3 million in incentives and providing $10 million in bonds to cover the cost. This, as Graeter's announced it, planned to distribute its ice creams outside of the Cincinnati market and to supermarkets in other cities, including Denver, Houston, and Atlanta. This expanded its production to 300,000 gallons of ice cream a year, with equipment to expand its capacity to 1.5 million gallons a year. It also features a shrink-wrap facility to allow it to package ice cream to ship faster. By 2010, it had grown to a $35 million business between company owned and franchise locations. Additional technology investments have allowed it to better track its sales and performance of different products and business units. This has also informed a seasonal hiring strategy for the company as it on-boards additional staff for busier seasons. Around this time, it began a more aggressive campaign to grow distribution of its pints into more large U.S. cities outside of the Midwest and grow its national profile. By 2017, the company was distributing its pints of ice cream in about 6,000 grocery stores, heavily concentrated in Kroger stores, in addition to upscale restaurants and country clubs. The company also began partnering with other local food companies, most notably Braxton Brewing Co., a microbrewery in Covington, Kentucky, to make a Black Raspberry Chip milk stout, a craft beer based on its signature ice cream flavor. This partnership was successful enough that the next year, the two companies collaborated on a pumpkin ale that hearkened to Graeter's seasonal fall ice cream flavor. In 2018, Graeter's consolidated its company headquarters into a 7,000-square-foot office at 2245 Gilbert Ave. in Walnut Hills, bringing all retail, marketing and creative, production, accounting and finance employees under one roof. That year, it also finalized a deal to purchase 11 stores in Louisville, Lexington and Indianapolis from its last major franchisee, Jim Tedesco of Tedesco LLC, bringing all of its over 50 retail locations under company management. Products \\"French pot process\\" = Louis Graeter initially stirred the ice cream by hand in a metal pail in a wooden bucket filled with ice and salt, a painstaking and expensive process owing to the rarity of ice and salt at the time. This required it to be eaten almost immediately. Eventually, though, the business developed what it later called the \\"French pot process,\\" developing a hand-made, cylindrical metal bowl that sat inside a wooden bowl filled with ice and salt. This pot would then be filled with a mixture of cream, sugar and eggs. The pot would then be attached to a motor and spun, forcing the mixture to the sides of the bowl where it would freeze, being scraped off by paddle until it came together. The ice cream must be made in small batches of at a time, then hand- packed into cartons. This results in an ice cream that is more dense and contains 20 to 25 percent air mixed in during the freezing process, as opposed to other styles where 50 percent air is mixed in. Consequently, a pint of Graeter's ice cream weighs , and can be almost twice the weight of other styles. With 14 percent milk fat and high-quality ingredients, the ice cream falls in the \\"superpremium\\" segment of the ice cream market. Graeter's ice cream is made using the French pot method. All their ice creams are created from an egg custard base. After pasteurization, the flavorings are added. The custard and flavoring mixture is placed into two-gallon French pots. The pots are then spun in saltwater, while a blade scrapes the cream that freezes against the sides of the pot. After 15‚Äì20 minutes of immersion in the saltwater, any larger additives are mixed in, such as cookie dough or chocolate chips. Ice cream is hand-scooped into pint containers. Graeter's makes each day. Thus the shop markets that its ice cream is still made by hand. = Ice cream flavors = Initially, the shop offered only vanilla and chocolate flavors in a dish or a cone. It began offering seasonal strawberry, lemon and peach flavors when the fruits were in season, expanding them to year-round flavors thanks to cold storage capabilities. Graeter's considers eight flavors, including black cherry, coffee, strawberry, butter pecan, and several sorbet flavors, as its original menu. Graeter's sources its dairy products from nearby Louis Trauth Dairy and Smith Dairy, and later made both of them distributors of its ice cream. It has retained its recipe of cream, sugar, eggs and flavorings, and has avoided changing the recipe during health trends or amid competition from healthier frozen treat brands, or those using artificial sweeteners. Though it is gravitated to more all-natural ingredients in recent years, including substituting beet juice instead of food dye and sourcing dairy products from hormone-free cows. There are some exceptions, such as vanilla that is imported from Madagascar. In the Cincinnati market it has continued to out-sell Ben & Jerry's and H√§agen-Dazs ice cream at Kroger locations in the Cincinnati market, making the city the only place in the country where those brands are not top sellers in the supermarket. Instead of adding chocolate chips to the ice cream, Graeter's devised a technique to add melted chocolate mixed with a small amount of vegetable oil near the end of the stirring process, which results in chocolate chunks of different sizes. According to the company's recollections, this technique was created when a young Wilmer Graeter stole chocolate and poured it into a pot of ice cream. For a time, it also molded ice cream into different shapes to serve. These chocolate chips were incorporated into a number of flavors to great success, and by 2010 chocolate chip ice cream flavors accounted for 70 percent of its sales. A bittersweet Hershey-based fudge sauce was created before World War II for use in sundaes, and the company later shifted to using a chocolate from a Nestl√© spinoff company. It added parfaits, milkshakes and sodas as well over time. Later, it also introduced gelato, sorbet, and low-glycemic desserts. Dick Graeter first created a Black Raspberry flavor, and around the 1970s began adding chocolate chips. For a time it sold both varieties but discontinued the first version after the second was more successful. This flavor has since become the best-selling flavor in the chain, accounting for 20 percent of its overall sales by 2010. He also launched a program for seasonal flavors of ice cream, notably beginning with a coconut variety in January, cherry chocolate chip in February, chocolate almond in March and so on. After a time, it instead offered \\"seasonal\\" flavors for up to three months at a time, with favorites including strawberry chocolate chip in the springtime, or peppermint or eggnog around the end of the wintertime. = Candy and baked goods = Louis Graeter also sold chocolate confections from early in its history. The company initially tried to use Hershey chocolate for candy, but due to a lack of availability during World War II it shifted to using chocolate Nestl√© spinoff company Mr. Peter's. Among its confections was the opera cream, a variety of cream filled chocolate candy popular in Cincinnati. Today, its chocolates and confections are produced at the Bond Hill plant. Steve Hellmich was hired in 2001 to oversee this operation. For the Easter holiday, the shot offers a \\"build your own basket\\" with chocolate bunny, cream eggs, jelly beans and opera creams. During Easter it also offers a \\"birds nest\\" made from chocolate and a mixture of rice and coconut flakes. A bakery business was launched in 1957, and added and expanded in the 1960s and 1970s, initially to make pies and cakes, but demand for other kinds of goods including rolls, coffee cake, Danish pastry, donuts, bread, cupcakes, √©clairs, cookies, cream horns and turnovers. Later, ice cream cakes and ice cream sandwiches grew popular as well. Though, the company's bakery business has not traditionally performed as well as its ice cream, and at times it found the bakery portion of the business losing money. Members of the Graeter family have considered ceasing the business but never came to a conclusive decision. = Novelties = Under Louis Graeter, a number of other items were initially sold at the store, including ceramics, candy cases, toys and other novelties, primarily to turn a profit in the winter when ice cream sales were slow. When Regina Graeter died in 1955, the company's next generation stopped selling novelty items in a bid to focus more on ice cream, baked goods and chocolates.  Ice cream shops  Graeter's maintained one location on McMillan Street until 1919, when Regina Graeter took control of the business and sought to expand it from a neighborhood shop. By 1929 it had six locations. The original East McMillan Street location where the Graeter family sold its ice cream remained open until 1972, before the property was sold two years later. In the 1980s, the business also began franchising and through a franchisee opened its first Northern Kentucky locations in 1984. In 1989, another franchisee opened another location in Columbus and, eventually, the same franchise was able to add locations in Dayton, as well, with this franchise eventually growing to 15 stores and managing its own ice cream production in a Columbus store by 2000. Another franchisee opened a location in Louisville in 1998 after lobbying unsuccessfully to expand the ice cream business into Indianapolis, with that franchisee growing to eight Kentucky locations by 2010. By 2010 it had 45 locations across all of these markets. In 2010, the company bought back the Columbus and Dayton franchise, giving it direct control of all Ohio stores. At the time, it said it did not have plans to add additional franchisees. Graeter family members also said they intended to keep it a family business, resisting offers to sell the company to a larger brand. The 2017 acquisition of the Louisville franchise eliminated the final non-family owned footprint of the ice cream chain. In 2018, a location opened in Cincinnati Union Terminal, in the former Rookwood tea room.https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/local/cincinnati/2018/12/23/cincinnati- museum-center-union-terminal-rookwood-tea-room-ice-cream-parlor-opens- graeters-remodel/2401974002/ About 60 percent of the company's $35 million in business in 2010 came from its retail operations, with grocery store sales accounting for 20 percent and shipping another 20 percent. With projected expansion into new markets, though, the company predicted at the time its shipping business could grow to 40 percent of its overall revenue mix. The company then began expanding its presence online as well, including becoming active on social media. Its Facebook page grew to 55,000 fans by 2010. This grew to 170,000 by 2017, aided by additional social media campaigns on Twitter and YouTube and Instagram. The company employs a social media manager and built a marketing strategy of engaging with fans online. Otherwise, the company does not invest heavily in traditional marketing campaigns, particularly in its traditional home markets, though does some advertising when it introduces new or seasonal flavors. Loyalty programs and direct mailing campaigns have been introduced over the years as well.  Reception  In 2004, Cincinnati magazine named the black raspberry chip flavor one of the foods that \\"defines\\" the city of Cincinnati, alongside Virginia Bakery Schnecken, Trauth Dairy and Kroger products. The shop is also the official ice cream of the Cincinnati Bengals. The ice cream has attracted praise from national food writers and tastemakers, as well. Oprah Winfrey praised the ice cream in a 2002 edition of O and also talked about it on her The Oprah Winfrey Show, and the next day the business shipped 400 boxes of ice cream all over the country, 10 times the average. In 2005, food writer David Rosengarten of Gourmet magazine named Graeter's the best ice cream in his newsletter, after getting numerous letters of support for the business. In 2006, Forbes writer Christopher Buckley also declared black raspberry chip the best ice cream. Vanity Fair recommended it as a holiday gift in 2005, calling it \\"one of the best homemade-ice-cream companies in the country. Saveur praised Graeter's twice amid a roundup of ice cream shops around the country, while Chicago magazine termed it an essential experience when visiting Cincinnati. The chain also counts Sarah Jessica Parker, George Clooney, Nick Lachey, Kevin Costner, Ashley Judd and Justin Timberlake as customers. Rosemary Clooney, a family friend, served as celebrity spokesperson for the company for a time. Ben & Jerry's co-founder Ben Cohen professed Graeter's was one of his favorite ice cream shops as well. Other notable fans of the company include singer Harry Connick Jr, and food writer David Rosengarten of Rosengarten Report. Graeter's ice cream won \\"Best Sweet\\" at the 2014 Food Network South Beach Wine and Food Festival. Graeter's has been featured on shows on the Travel Channel, Food Network, Fine Living Channel, and History Channel.

Car washes can be self-serve, fully automated, or full-service with attendants who wash the vehicle. It may also be an event where people pay to have their cars washed by volunteers as a method to raise money for some purpose. History With the modern convenience of automatic car washes, it may be difficult to remember that the industry was not always so high-tech. Though, other commercial car washes came before it, the first semi-automatic car wash in the United States made its debut in 1946, and from there, the industry has grown in both size and sophistication. =1946= The start of the history of car washing dated back into 1914. People used manpower to push or move the cars through stages of the process. Eventually, manual car wash operations peaked at 32 drive- through facilities in the United States. Prior to this time, the evolution of car washing was just at the beginning, and that the automatic car washing was born. The first semi-automatic car wash was active for the first time in Detroit, Michigan using automatic pulley systems and manual brushing. =1955= Many things had occurred within 1955 regarding car washing history. A businessman named Dan Hanna was encouraged by the car washers in Detroit, operated his own materials, then eventually made his own car wash called the Rub-a-Dub in Oregon. In 1957, he formed the Hanna Enterprises and eventually reached about 31 car washes in America. In 1959, Hanna operated his wash rack until he made the first mechanized car washing system. As the news spread throughout the city, so did his business. =1960s= By the mid 1960s Hanna Enterprises had established itself as the main source innovator and the manufacturer of car washing equipments and materials. Over time, Hanna had made several machines that will be the first to do the main requirements over car washing, this includes the Wrap-Around Brush, Roller-on-demand Conveyor belt, soft cloth friction washing, several ways to wash the tires, and a recirculating water system. With that said, Hanna Enterprises have become the largest vehicle washing equipment manufacturer. =1970s= In the 1970s it was a difficult time for the car washing industry, as the result of the gasoline prices increasing rapidly. Still, Hanna Enterprises made another two inventions during this time: the automatic wheel cleaner, and the polish'n'wax. Categories An in-bay automatic car wash performing a friction wash pass While there are many types of car washes, most fall into the following categories: *Car wash lift (single-post), where cars are placed in a lift platforms which can be used to wash under car. *Hand car wash facilities, where the vehicle is washed by employees. *Self-service facilities, which are generally coin-operated, where the customer does the washing, including pressurized \\"jet washing\\". *In-bay automatics consist of an automatic washing machine and dryer that rolls back and forth over a stationary vehicle - often seen at filling stations and stand-alone wash sites. *Tunnel washes, which use a conveyor to move the vehicle through a series of fixed cleaning mechanisms. *Chemical car wash, also known as waterless car wash, uses chemicals to wash and polish car surface. Claims to be an eco-friendly car wash method. Recommended only for cars with light dirt accumulation to avoid paint damage. *Steam car washes use a jet of steam and micro fiber towels, some include detergent injection. Known to have originated from South Korea, steam car washes have been especially popular as a low- investment, eco-friendly car wash solution in Asia, Middle East, and Europe thanks to its sanitizing features and mobility. *Mobile car washes, often also serving as mobile detailing systems, which carry plastic water tanks and use pressure washers. Sometimes these systems are mounted on trailers, on trucks, or in vans. Generally these operators also have a generator to run a shop vac., buffers, and other tools as well. Mechanized car washes, especially those with brushes, were once avoided by some meticulous car owners because of the risk of damaging the finish. Paint finishes have improved as have car washing processes, and this perception of vehicle damage is much less prevalent today. However, this perception was the motive behind the rise of facilities utilizing \\"brushless\\" (cloth) and \\"touch-free\\" (high-pressure water) equipment, as well as modern \\"foam\\" washing wheels made of closed cell foam. In today's modern car wash facilities, whether tunnel, in-bay automatic or self-serve, soaps and other cleaning solutions used are designed to loosen and eliminate dirt and grime. This is in contrast to earlier times, when hydrofluoric acid, a hazardous chemical, was commonly used as a cleaning agent in the industry by some operators. There has been a strong move in the industry to shift to safer cleaning solutions. Most car wash facilities are required by law to treat and/or reuse their water and may be required to maintain waste-water discharge permits, in contrast to unregulated facilities or even driveway washing (at one's home), where waste-water can end up in the storm drain and, eventually, in streams, rivers, and lakes. Self-serve car wash A multi-bay, coin-operated self-service car wash in Seattle, Washington A simple and automated type of car wash that is typically coin-operated or token-operated self-service system. Newer self-service car washes offer the ability to pay with credit cards or loyalty cards. The vehicle is parked inside a large covered bay that is equipped with a trigger gun and wand (a high-pressure sprayer) and a scrub foam-brush. When customers insert coins or tokens into the controller, they can choose options such as soap, tire cleaner, wax or clear water rinse, all dispensed from the sprayer, or scrub the vehicle with the foam brush. The number of coins or tokens inserted determines the amount of time customers have to operate the equipment; in most instances, a minimum number of coins is necessary to start the equipment. These facilities are often equipped with separate vacuum stations that allow customers to clean the upholstery and rugs inside their cars. Some self- service car washes offer hand-held dryers, a somewhat new feature. Automatic car wash Rotating brushes inside a conveyor car-wash =Conveyorized/tunnel car wash= The first conveyorized automatic car wash appeared in Hollywood, CA in 1940. Conveyorized automatic car washes consist of tunnel-like buildings into which customers (or attendants) drive. Some car washes have their customers pay through a computerized POS, or point of sale unit, also known as an \\"automatic cashier\\", which may take the place of a human cashier. The mechanism inputs the wash PLU into a master computer or a tunnel controller automatically. When the sale is automated, after paying the car is put into a line-up called the stack or queue. The stack moves sequentially, so the wash knows what each car purchased. After pulling up to the tunnel entrance, an attendant usually guides the customer onto the conveyor. At some washes, the system will send the correct number of rollers automatically, based on tire sensors. The tire sensor lets the wash know where the wheels are and how far apart they are. On other systems the employee may guide the customer on and press a 'Send Car' button on the tunnel controller, to manually send the rollers which push the car through. Prior to entering the automated section of the wash tunnel, attendants may prewash customers' cars. A vehicle exiting the friction zone of the wash. Visible are side brushes, wrap-around brushes, the conveyor, and a high pressure rinse arch. The car wash will typically start cleaning with chemicals called presoaks applied through special arches. CTAs, or \\"chemical tire applicators,\\" apply specialized formulations, which remove brake dust and build up from the surface of the wheels and tires. In some car washes, presoak application is followed by an empty space, or idle zone. Wheel cleaning equipment, such as sill brushes or high pressure wheel blasters, may be placed in the idle zone. A sill brush (also known as a wheel brush or tire brush) consists of an 8-foot-long brush assembly which is pushed against the car's wheels and door sill area. Sill brushes are typically use flagged bristle, as dirt is usually most heavily concentrated on the lower parts of the car. The material on a sill brush may have alternating lengths or use material which is intentionally mounted off-center to allow wheel surfaces of various depths to be cleaned. Sill brushes rely on the rotation of a customer's car's wheels in order to achieve complete wheel contact. Similarly to the CTAs, wheel brushes often only activate when the customer buys a wheel cleaning upgrade. Some car washes use wheel-rim disc brushes in addition to or in place of sill brushes. These assemblies extend out towards the wheel and follow it at the same speed as the conveyor while rotating at high speeds to clean the wheels. At the end of a car wash's presoak idle zone is often a high pressure arch which direct high pressure water at a vehicle's surface. A typical \\"tunnel\\" car wash viewed from the inside of a vehicle Mitters are ribbon-like components which suspend cloth strips or sheets over the tunnel while utilizing motion to increase friction against the car's surface. The friction zone may also include specialized front grill and rear brushes. Older automatic washes - a majority of which were built prior to 1980 - used to use brushes with soft nylon bristles, which tended to leave a nylon deposit in the shape of a bristle, called brush marks, on the vehicle's paint. Many newer washes use either soft cloth or a closed cell foam brush, which does not hold dirt or water, thus is far less likely to harm any painted finish. A glass car wash building containing an inbay automatic and freestanding blowers After the main friction zone, some car washes have a dedicated care zone. Prior to entering the care zone, the car is rinsed with fresh water. This is immediately followed by a series of extra services. In many car washes, the first of these services is a polish wax. After the polish wax application is typically a retractable mitter or top brush and, in some cases, side brushes or wrap-around brushes. Next is a protectant, which creates a thin protective film over a vehicle's surface. Protectants generally repel water, which assists in drying the car and aiding in the driver's ability to see through their wind shield during rain. A low-end wax or clear coat protectant follows the main protectant. A drying agent is typically applied at the end of the tunnel to assist in removing water from the vehicle's surface prior to forced air drying. After the drying agent, there may be a \\"spot free\\" rinse of soft water, that has been filtered of the salts normally present, and sent through semi-permeable membranes to produce highly purified water that will not leave spots. Dryers may be present in a variety of forms, such as stationary gantries with a contouring roof jet or as small circular assemblies with nozzles of various shapes and sizes mounted on arches. Mitters, side brushes, top brushes, and/or wraps outfitted with chamois- or microfiber-based material may follow the dryers. At \\"full-service\\" car washes, the exterior of the car is washed mechanically or by hand, or using a combination of both, with attendants available to dry the car manually, and to clean the interior . Many full service car washes also provide \\"detailing\\" services, which may include polishing and waxing the car's exterior by hand or machine, shampooing and steaming interiors, and other services to provide thorough cleaning and protection to the car. Touchless wash A touchless in-bay automatic car wash Like soft-touch car washes, touchless car washes are automated, with the vehicle passing through a tunnel where the vehicle is cleaned; however, touchless car washes do not use the foam or cloth applicators that soft-touch washes use, instead relying on high-pressure washers to both clean and rinse the vehicle off. Sensors utilized by these washes allow for a more precise clean along the vehicle's exact shape. To compensate for not physically contacting the vehicle, touchless washes use more caustic detergents than ordinary car washes. Because the vehicle is not physically impacted during a touchless wash, the vehicle is at a lower risk of being damaged. However, touchless washes have a harder time cleaning off tougher materials or reaching difficult-to-reach locations on vehicles, and their usage of stronger chemicals can potentially damage a vehicle's paint finish. Bikini car wash Bikini car wash Bikini car washes are typically a summer events in the US and which are fund raisers for a school, a sport association or other youth organizations or charities. Typically, women in bikinis bring in donors by standing on a roadside with colorful cardboard signs or posters, and the cars are washed by their classmates in a nearby parking lot. Depending on the organization responsible, as well as the local laws, a variation of the bikini car wash sometimes occurs, in which the women will wash the car topless, usually for an extra fee. There are also commercial bikini car washes, where bikini-clad women wash the cars for a fee and the entertainment of the drivers. Hooters restaurants usually have bikini car washes in the summer to attract customers. Environmental factors The primary environmental considerations for car washing are: *Use of water and energy resources; *Contamination of surface waters; *Contamination of soil and groundwater. Use of water supplies and energy are self-evident, since car washes are users of such resources. The professional car wash industry has made great strides in reducing its environmental footprint, a trend that will continue to accelerate due to regulation and consumer demand. Many car washes already use water reclamation systems to significantly reduce water usage and a variety of energy usage reduction technologies. These systems may be mandatory where water restrictions are in place. In Europe, Germany is leading the way and has very strict regulations making it illegal to wash your car on the street or in your driveway. Contamination of surface waters may arise from the rinse discharging to storm drains, which eventually drain to rivers and lakes. Chief pollutants in such wash-water include phosphates; oil and grease; and lead. This is almost exclusively an issue for home/driveway washing, and parking lot style charity washes. Professional carwashing is a \\"non-point source\\" of discharge that has the ability to capture these contaminants, normally in interceptor drains, so the contaminants can be removed before the water enters sanitary systems. (Water and contaminants that enter storm water drains does not undergo treatment, and is released directly into rivers, lakes and streams.) Soil contamination is sometimes related to such surface runoff, but more importantly is associated with soil contamination from underground fuel tanks or auto servicing operations which commonly are ancillary uses of car wash sites ‚Äî but not an issue for car washing itself. For these reasons, some state and local environmental groups (the most notable being the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection) have begun campaigns to encourage consumers to use professional car washes as opposed to driveway washing, including moving charity car wash fund raisers from parking lots to professional car washes.

Melbourne Age Agenda supplement, 18 October 1992 pp. 1-2 6 August 1951) is an Australian television personality and musician, and a triple Gold Logie award-winner. He rose to national fame as the host and executive producer of the long-running comedy-variety program Hey Hey It's Saturday and continued his television celebrity and status as host of the live-performance program Dancing with the Stars. In 2018, Somers was honoured by Australia Post by having his portrait featured on a series of postage stamps. Early life Somers lived in the Melbourne suburb of Prahran and was educated at the Christian Brothers College, St. Kilda. A drummer, he joined a group playing music in the style of Herb Alpert which began under the name \\"Pasquale and his Mexican Rhythm\\". Under the name \\"Somerset\\", the group appeared on GTV-9's talent-quest programme New Faces, winning their way to the finals, only to be beaten by John Williamson. His parents and brothers had changed their name from Schulz to Somers by 1970.Paul Daley 'Seeking Mr. Saturday Night' The Age, 18 October 1922 p. 18 Television careerThe Hey Hey It's Saturday era (1971‚Äì99)= Somers started professional TV work on 14 July 1971, taking over as the presenter of an afternoon children's program called Cartoon Corner, which was previously Skeeter's Cartoon Corner, hosted by James Kemsley (who went on to draw the famous Ginger Meggs comic strip for 23 years). Daryl's first words were, \\"Hi, I'm Daryl Somers, Skeeter will no longer be with us and now it's time for a cartoon.\\" His audition consisted of him doing an impersonation of Mr Magoo.TV Week 19 October 1996. \\"Hey Hey it's 25\\" by Darren Devlyn, pp. 76‚Äì77. He was paid $75 a week to do the show.TV Week 19 October 1996. \\"Hey Hey it's 25\\" by Darren Devlyn, pp. 76‚Äì77. Later that year, on 9 October 1971, Hey Hey It's Saturday started. Somers at first co-hosted with footballer Peter McKenna, but eight weeks later, his co-host became the pink hand-puppet Ossie Ostrich, which was operated by former In Melbourne Tonight staff writer Ernie Carroll. McKenna continued to appear on the show for some time. Originally created as a Saturday morning children's cartoon show, the program gradually expanded in both size and scope. Soon, additional cast members joined, including booth announcer John Blackman, who also voiced many (unseen) characters, and, later, co-host Jacki MacDonald. The program's production crew also began to play a prominent role in the series, with sound- effects technician Murray Tregonning adding humorous sound bites and sound effects from a huge bank of recorded eight-track cartridges, and personnel such as long-serving cameraman \\"Lucky Phil\\" Lambert making regular appearances. Props assistant Ian \\"Krystal\\" Murray provided props, most famously the \\"Dicky Knee\\" character: The series' distinctive brand of irreverent humour soon attracted a sizable adult audience, and in 1984, it had become so popular, Nine made the unprecedented decision to move it to a 9:30 Saturday evening timeslot, and renamed Hey Hey It's Saturday Night. It remained on Saturday night for the rest of its run, but moved to the 6:30 time-slot in 1985 and eventually also reverted to the name Hey Hey It's Saturday. At its height, Hey Hey It's Saturday was one of the most popular and consistently high-rating series in the history of Australian television, winning many awards, including three Gold Logie awards for Somers. Hey Hey screened for 28 years (1971‚Äì99) on the Nine Network across Australia. It had by then become an institution, so considerable shock occurred when the Nine Network announced that the series was to be axed at the end of 1999. =Family Feud and The Daryl Somers Show (1980‚Äì83)= In 1980, Daryl replaced Tony Barber on the quiz show Family Feud, and hosted the program for three years and 713 episodes. In June 1982, he was given his own night-time TV variety show ‚Äì without Ossie ‚Äì in the style of The Don Lane Show aptly named The Daryl Somers Show, which ran for 18 months. Somers still ran Hey, Hey during this time. All the hard work paid off with Daryl winning his first Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian TV in 1983. Also in 1983, Somers was crowned King of Moomba with Edna Everage as his Court Jester.\\"Moomba: A festival for the people\\" , melbourne.vic.gov.au, pp. 17‚Äì22 (photo at page 19) =Break (2000‚Äì03)= During the five years after the show's demise in December 1999, Daryl Somers rarely made public appearances, with the exception of a court appearance in 2001 to answer a drink driving charge'Hey day', Sydney Morning Herald 13 July 2001 p. 66 (after which Somers admitted he was \\"a bloody idiot\\" ‚Äì a reference to a famous antidrunk-driving advertising campaign of that time), and an appearance as a guest on the Network Ten program Rove Live.

It rated strongly, attracting 3.9+ millionMichael Idato, Hey Hey wins ratings showdown, theage.com.au, 1 October 2009. viewers, although the second show generated international controversy because of a \\"blackface\\" Jackson 5 parody act (called The Jackson Jive) that appeared on the \\"Red Faces\\" segment. With the success of the Reunion Specials in 2009, the show returned in 2010 as a regular series. The 2010 series had twenty episodes airing, with the first thirteen episodes airing from April until July, with the remaining seven episodes airing in October and November, all of which rated well. Hey Hey It's Saturday did not return in 2011 and the Nine Network made no further comment whether the show would ever return. =You're Back in the Room (2016)= In October 2015, it was announced that Somers would return to the Nine Network to host an Australian version of the British hypnotism game show, You're Back in the Room in 2016.

Music career Somers released two comedy albums in the mid-1970s, co-credited to Ossie Ostrich. In the mid-1980s, Somers was signed to Brian Cadd's label Graffiti Records. The pair worked on a pop album that was ultimately shelved. In Cadd's 2010 autobiography, he said (of Somers) \\"making that album, he was undoubtedly the hardest working person I'd ever been with in the studio\\" adding \\"It was a truly fun project. However, there was one serious flaw that finally beat us. Daryl's voice was just too classically trained. He could get it right down to the very edge of pop but there was always that slight cabaret vibrato that gave him away.\\" Somers released an album on the Sony BMG label titled Songlines in 2005. =Albums= * Hey!

Life He was the only son of Robert Chandler, of London. He was born in London on 31 January 1828. His early education was neglected, but by diligent study in the Guildhall Library he acquired enough Greek and Latin to enable him to matriculate at Oxford on 22 June 1848. On 8 December 1851, he took a scholarship at Pembroke College, of which on 4 November 1853 he was elected fellow, having graduated B.A. (first class in liter√¶ humaniores) in the preceding year. He proceeded M.A. in 1855, was for some years lecturer and tutor at his college, and held the Waynflete professor of moral and metaphysical philosophy from 1867 until his death. After the publication of an inaugural lecture, The Philosophy of Mind: a Corrective for some Errors of the Day, London, 1867, 8vo, he confined himself to oral teaching. His favourite topic was the Nicomachean Ethics, of which his exposition was acute and stimulating. He lived the life of a scholarly recluse, devoted to the study of Aristotle and his commentators, and is understood to have amassed copious materials for an edition of the master's Fragments, in which he was unhappily forestalled by the German scholar, Valentin Rose. In 1884, he was appointed curator of the Bodleian Library. An enthusiastic bibliophile, he began his accession to office by a strong protest against the practice of lending the rare printed books and manuscripts preserved in that venerable repository. By way of alternative, he proposed the reproduction of texts by photography, and is said to have had an Arabic manuscript thus copied for Sir Richard Burton at his own expense. As a scholar, he was distinguished by vast, minute, and recondite learning and immense laboriousness. His knowledge of the Greek commentators on Aristotle was unique; and his failure to leave any monument worthy of his powers was due partly to his extreme fastidiousness, partly to chronic ill-health. Throughout the greater part of his life he was a prey to insomnia, which in his later years induced the fatal habit of taking chloral in enormous quantities. He died on 16 May 1889 from the effects, as certified by inquest, of a dose of prussic acid administered by himself at Pembroke College. His books and manuscripts he left to Mrs. Evans, wife of the master of Pembroke, and she by a deed of gift dated 17 October 1889 gave them to the college on condition that they were preserved as a separate collection. Works Chandler's best work is unquestionably his Practical Introduction to Greek Accentuation, of which The Elements of Greek Accentuation is a synopsis; but the depth and variety of his erudition were hardly less conspicuous in his Miscellaneous Emendations and Suggestions. He also made two valuable contributions to the bibliography of Aristotle: * A Catalogue of Editions of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, and of Works illustrative of them printed in the Fifteenth Century; together with a Letter of Constantinus Paleocappa, and the Dedication of a Translation of Aristotle's Politics to Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, by Leonardus Aretinus, hitherto unpublished, Oxford, 1868, 4to. * Chronological Index to Editions of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, and of Works illustrative of them from the Origin of Printing to the Year 1799, Oxford, 1878, 4to.

Medical uses Clemastine is used to relieve hay fever and allergy symptoms, including sneezing; runny nose; and red, itchy, tearing eyes. Prescription strength clemastine is also used to relieve the itching and swelling of hives. https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682542.html Side effects Overdosage symptoms are paradoxical, ranging from CNS depression to stimulation. Stimulation is most common in children, and is usually followed by excitement, hallucinations, ataxia, loss of coordination, muscle twitching, athetosis, hyperthermia, cyanosis, convulsions, tremors, and hyperreflexia. This may be followed by postictal depression and cardiovascular/respiratory arrest. Other common overdose symptoms include dry mouth, fixed dilated pupils, flushing of the face, and pyrexia. In adults, overdose usually leads to CNS depression, ranging from drowsiness to coma. Pharmacology Clemastine is an antihistamine with anticholinergic and sedative effects. Antihistamines competitively bind to histamine receptor sites, thus reducing the neurotransmitter's effects. Effects of histamine (which are countered by antihistamines) include: * Increased capillary permeability * Increased capillary dilatation * Edema (i.e., swelling) * Pruritus (Itch) * Gastrointestinal/respiratory smooth muscle constriction Clemastine inhibits both the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator effects of histamine. Depending on the dose, the drug can produce paradoxical effects, including CNS stimulation or depression. Most antihistamines exhibit some type of anticholinergic activity. Antihistamines act by competitively binding to H1-receptor sites, thus blocking the binding endogenous histamine. Antihistamines do not chemically inactivate or prevent the normal release of histamine. Clemastine does also act as FIASMA (functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase). Clemastine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and peak plasma concentrations are attained in 2‚Äì4 hours. Antihistamines are thought to be metabolized in the liver, mostly by mono-/didemethylation and glucuronide conjugation. It is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 and may interfere with other drugs metabolized by this isozyme. Mechanism of action Clemastine is a selective histamine H1 antagonist. It binds to the histamine H1 receptor, thus blocking the action of endogenous histamine, which leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms caused by histamine.

Edenburg has a population of 30, and is a mixed use residential/agricultural area.  History  Edenburg is a living example of the settlement preferences of the Mennonites, originally from northern Germany (Prussia) who emigrated to Canada via Russia. Although governmental policy of the day required the farmers to take up residence on their own homestead quarter (a portion of land 1/2 mile square), the Mennonites preferred and sometimes were given governmental exemption to live in communities similar to those they had left in Europe. Thus, Edenburg and many other such communities sprang up with narrow frontages on the roadway, yet had their back boundaries set rather far from the edge of the road. The effect is similar to the river lots favoured in Quebec, and by the Saskatchewan M√©tis people. In 1902, just as the Canadian Northern Railways was constructed past Aberdeen, Jacob Unrau and his family came from Manitoba. He homesteaded the north west quarter of section 14, township 39, range 3, west of the third meridian but bought 15-39-3-3 of what Canada had given the railways. He founded Edenburg on this section, giving each of his children, as they married, a strip of land and built a church and graveyard. In 1904, daughter Anna married Cornelius A. Ens and was given one such lot. Anna, who died in childbirth with her child Isaac in 1913, was an early entry into the graveyard. Ens established a store in 1918. Edenburg was situated on an east- west road, and gradually people settled across the road and completed the community. Until 1921 Edenburg had its own school taught in German, for its students and Mennonites in neighboring farms.  Social services  As of 2005, neither schooling nor business are carried on any more in Edenburg though some farm the surrounding land, with residents travelling to Aberdeen or to Saskatoon for most commercial and educational matters or to commute to work.

Plot summary This book focuses on the struggles between the pioneers to establish a new social order now that they have left Basilica. The new society is opposite to that of the previous societies - male dominated instead of female dominated, monogamous and lifelong marriages instead of the yearly contracts of Basilica. The struggles between the characters ultimately come down to the struggles between Nafai and Elemak, two sons of Volemak. Nafai leads the faction who have faith in the Oversoul, while Elemak leads the faction who want desperately to return to the civilization of doomed Basilica. Both are ostensibly under the leadership of Volemak (and not Rasa, as they had been in the city). The settlers, after years of traveling, finally arrive in a land lost in ancient times which holds the secret of the Oversoul. Additionally, many children are born, all in their preparation for the ultimate journey to Earth.

He is best known for writing the autobiographical screenplay and novel Summer of '42, which became one of the highest-grossing films and one of the best selling novels of the 1970s, respectively.Fassel, Preston. \\"Rediscovering Herman Raucher\\". Cinedump.com. Retrieved 26 January 2017 He began his writing career during the Golden Age of Television, when he moonlighted as a scriptwriter while working for a Madison Avenue advertising agency. He effectively retired from writing in the 1980s after a number of projects failed to come to fruition, though his books remain in print and a remake of one of his films, Sweet November, was produced in 2001. Life and career Raucher was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Sophie (Weinshank) and Benjamin Brooks Raucher. His father was a World War I veteran whom Raucher recalled as having a bayonet wound across his forehead. The family's financial situation fluctuated according to the success of the elder Raucher's career. During more profitable years, the family vacationed on Nantucket. During one such trip, when he was fourteen, Raucher developed a friendship with an older woman he identified as \\"Dorothy\\", a war bride whose husband was fighting in Europe, an event which formed the basis for Summer of '42. During this time, Raucher's best friend was a boy named Oscar \\"Oscy\\" Seltzer, who became a United States Army medic and who died during the Korean War while tending to a wounded soldier. After graduating from high school, Raucher attended New York University, where he studied advertising and worked as a cartoonist for $38 per week, drawing comic strips. After graduating he became an office boy at 20th Century Fox and eventually worked his way into advertising; Raucher was known for his hobby of writing plays, which several ad executives believed to be the mark of a creative genius. Raucher proved successful as an ad man, and was part of the advertising team that developed the ad campaign for the opening of Disneyland. While working as an ad executive, Raucher simultaneously pursued a writing career, and several of his plays were successfully staged on Broadway, including Harold, one of the earliest plays to feature Anthony Perkins. Raucher also wrote for television, with short plays being featured as segments on a number of variety shows. A film agent saw a preliminary draft of the script for Raucher's play Sweet November and helped Raucher negotiate a sale of the script to Warner Brothers. While working on Sweet November, Raucher befriended Anthony Newley, with whom he shared a lifelong friendship; Newley later became the godfather to Raucher's youngest daughter. Following the success of Sweet November, Raucher helped Newley co-write Can Heironymus Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe and Find True Happiness?, which became a cult film. Inspired by several of his friends who expressed liberal sentiments while retaining racist ideologies, Raucher wrote the script for Watermelon Man. He successfully sold the script and partnered with Melvin van Peebles on making the film, though he was displeased with van Peebles' desire to alter his script in order to make the picture a black power movie. Due to the two's tense relationship, Raucher novelized his original script, both to retain his original message and to prevent van Peebles from publishing his own version of the story. Peebles' idea to turn Watermelon Man into the first black power picture later becameSweet Sweetback's Badass Song. For much of his early career, Raucher had attempted to sell a screenplay based on his experiences with Dorothy and Oscar Seltzer; after seven years he successfully sold the script of Summer of '42 to Robert Mulligan, who was looking to recreate the success of To Kill a Mockingbird. Although the script originally began as a tribute to Seltzer, Raucher instead found himself focusing more on Dorothy. Warner Bros., fearful that the movie would be a box office bomb, not only agreed to give Raucher a large share of the royalties in lieu of payment but also paid him to write a novelization of his script in an effort to drum up interest in the movie. Using the opportunity, Raucher focused the novel more on his relationship with Seltzer and less on Dorothy. Against expectation, Summer of '42 became a national bestseller and helped drive the movie to become one of the highest-grossing films of the 1970s. Raucher continued to write prolifically throughout the 1970s, ultimately publishing six novels and penning six screenplays throughout the decade. He effectively retired in the 1980s, when a number of planned film projects failed to materialize, notably a film adaptation of his bestselling novel There Should Have Been Castles, a period piece about 1950s artists partially inspired by his early career, which studio executives said was too lewd to successfully market. Despite this, Summer of '42 has continued to be a cultural phenomenon, with a Broadway show based on the film being produced in 2001. A planned film of Maynard's House, Raucher's sole horror novel, was trapped in development hell for much of the 1990s and 2000s, with the rights last belonging to Studio Canal, which planned to produce it under the title Ara/Froom. Personal life In 1960, Raucher married Broadway dancer Mary Katherine Martinet (born 1926), with whom he had two daughters. The two remained married until her death from cancer in July 2002. Great Santini Raucher is often credited as a ghostwriter for the film The Great Santini. However, Raucher did not work on the film, but instead was hired to write the pilot for a failed television adaptation of the film in the 1980s. Nonetheless, Raucher said that he continued to receive fan mail for The Great Santini, second only to letters for Summer of '42. Influence Journalist and novelist Preston Fassel cites Raucher's work, particularly A Glimpse of Tiger, as an influence on his own writing. Fassel credits a brief correspondence with Raucher in college, during which Raucher encouraged him to become a writer, as inspiring him to pursue fiction writing. Fassel wrote a biographical article of Raucher for the website Cinedump.com.

The conversion consists of the addition of a high-lift canard and a 260 hp (194 kW) engine. Design and development The 260SE traces its history to a STOL aircraft called Skyshark built by Jim Robertson in the late 1950s. The Skyshark incorporated a number of novel features, most notably a canard fitted with elevators in the slipstream behind the propeller. It was a technological success but too expensive to produce. However, Robertson incorporated many features of the Skyshark into the Wren Aircraft Company's Wren 460. The Wren 460 was a conversion of the Cessna 182 airframe that had full-span double-slotted flaps, movable spoilers to assist the ailerons with roll control and a movable high-lift canard. Later models offered a reversible pitch propeller for steeper approaches, and shorter landing runs. The aircraft was marketed as the only safe STOL aircraft. This was because it did not achieve its STOL characteristics through dangerous high angles of attack and by depending on a powerful engine to pull the aircraft upward (operating \\"behind the envelope\\"). At full gross weight, the Wren's take-off and landing distances were 300 ft. At idle power the aircraft could loiter at slow speed with outstanding stall resistance and over-the-nose visibility.Brown (1963) It could also make steep turns immediately after take-off. Because of the low approach speed, the Wren was approved for landings under Category II conditions (1/4 mile visibility and 100 foot ceilings on Instrument Landing System approaches). The company was seeking approval for landings under conditions of zero visibility shortly before the company went into bankruptcy in the late 1960s. However, there are reports that several \\"Wrens\\" did service with \\"Air America\\". Operational history Todd Peterson acquired the Supplemental Type Certificate for the Wren and produced a number of them in the early 1980s under the designation 460P. He evolved the Wren design into the Peterson 260SE. On the 260SE the wing modifications are absent. The aircraft depends on the high-lift canard and a more-powerful fuel-injected 260 HP Continental engine to achieve STOL capabilities. The additional power and speed modifications permit a cruise speed in excess of 150 knots. A canard- only conversion, the 230SE, is also available for about 1/3 the price of the canard/engine combination. The 230SE has inferior take-off performance compared to the 260SE but both aircraft have a stall speed of 35 knots. Specifications (Wren 460)ReferencesNotesBibliography= * Taylor, John W. R.

The Cimmerian Sibyl, by name Carmentis, was the prophetic priestess presiding over the Apollonian Oracle at Cimmerium in Italy, near Lake Avernus (i.e. Cumae).  Background  The word Sibyl comes (via Latin) from the ancient Greek word sibylla, meaning prophetess. There were many sibyls in the ancient world (e.g. Samian, Cumaean), but the Cimmerian Sibyl was venerated by the pre-Hellenic native populations. The Cimmerian Sibyl may have been a doublet for the Cumaean since the designation Cimmerian refers to priestesses who lived underground near Lake Avernus. An oracular shrine dedicated to Apollo, as at Delphi, stood on the Acropolis of Cumae. An underground Roman road ran from the southeastern part of Cumae, through Mount Grillo to the shores of Lake Avernus. However, there are sources that distinguished the two sybils such as those that noted it was the Cumaean and not the Cimmerian Sibyl who offered King Tarquin her book of prophecies.  Accounts  The sybil was mentioned by the Campanian playwright Naevius in his play Carmen belli penici written between 235 and 204 BC. This is one of the earliest references of the Italian sybil. Naevius also named the Cimmerian Sibyl in his books of the Punic War and Piso in his annals (Varro in Lactantius Inst. 1.6.9). An account also cited that it was the dramatist who accompanied Aeneas in the late third century B.C. when he visited the Cimmerian Sybil. The prophetess was also cited in an encyclopedia called Liber Floridus attributed to Lambert of St. Omer, where the sybil was distinguished from the Samian sibyl. She was identified in this text as \\"India\\" while the latter was called \\"Phemonoe\\". The sibyl's son Evander founded in Rome the first shrine of Pan which is called the Lupercal or Lupercum.

Biography She was born in Rouen of a wealthy family; her father's name was Desmares. She made her first appearance on the stage at Rouen with Charles Chevillet Champmesl√© (1645-1707), who called himself sieur de Champmesl√©, and they were married in 1666. By 1669 they were playing in Paris at the Theatre du Marais, her first appearance there being as Venus in Boyer's F√™te de V√©nus. The next year, as Hermione in Jean Racine's Andromaque, she had a great success at the Hotel de Bourgogne. Her intimacy with Racine dates from then. Some of his finest tragedies were written for her, but her repertoire was not confined to them, and many an indifferent play - like Thomas Corneille's Ariane and Comte d'Essex - owed its success to her natural manner of acting, and her pathetic rendering of the hapless heroine. Ph√®dre was the climax of her triumphs. She and her husband deserted the Hotel de Bourgogne for the Th√©√¢tre Gu√©n√©gaud. When the latter company merged into the new Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, Phaedre was selected for the opening on 26 August 1680 (see Troupe of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise in 1680). Here, with Madame Gurin as the leading comedy actress, she played the great tragic love parts for more than thirty years. During her career, ‚ÄúLa Champmesl√©‚Äù created a large number of famous roles. Besides those already mentioned, she did B√©r√©nice, Ariane, Atalide in Bajazet, Monime in Mithridate, Iphig√©nie in Iphig√©nie en Aulide, and the same character in Oreste et Pylade. She left the stage in a vain attempt to restore her health at Anteuil, where she died. La Fontaine dedicated to her his novel Belphegor, and Boileau immortalized her in verse. Family Her husband distinguished himself both as actor and playwright, and his Farisien (1682) gave Mme Gurin one of her greatest successes. Her brother, the actor Nicolas Desmares (c. 1650-1714), began as a member of a subsidized company at Copenhagen, but by her influence he came to Paris and was received in 1685 sans debut, the first time such an honor had been accorded at the Comedie Francaise, where he became famous for peasant parts. His daughter, to whom Christian V. and his queen stood sponsors, Christine Antoinette Charlotte Desmares (1682-1753), was a fine actress in both tragedy and soubrette parts. She made her debut at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise in 1699, in La Grange Chancels Oreste et Pylade, and was at once received as soci√©taire. She retired in 1721.

Tashiro was a tenor vocalist for Rats & Star, and later on made himself a name as a TV entertainer in Japan. He also directed a movie after his band broke up. His arrest for looking up a woman's skirt in September 2000 marked the beginning of Tashiro's problems with the law.  Early life  Masashi Tashiro was born in Saga Prefecture on August 31, 1956. His father, a manager of a cabaret chain, ran away with another woman. Subsequently, his parents divorced and he was raised solely by his mother. In 1961, when Tashiro was six years old, he and his mother moved to Tokyo and he entered missionary kindergarten. In 1963, he enrolled at Toyama elementary school in Shinjuku. At age thirteen, while a student at Okubo junior high school, his mother remarried and he chose to enroll in a higher grade at a private high school and live with his father in order not to rely financially on his mother's new husband. In 1972, he entered Machine Studies at Shibaura Institute of Technology Senior High School after graduating from Nakase junior high school in March of the same year. At Shibaura, he met Masayuki Suzuki. They later formed the band The Chanels. Tashiro and Suzuki were then considered juvenile delinquents. He was allegedly involved in fights, motorcycle gang problems, going to party at a disco and going girl- hunting every day during his time at high school. He has been detained by the police because of assault. He met his present wife at the end of his first year at high school. (However, he and his wife are now separated because of his several scandals and imprisonment) In March 1975, he graduated from Shibaura Institute of Technology Senior High School. It was around this time he started driving. His first car was a Sunny. His subsequent cars were a Gloria, a Camaro, a Ford, a Prelude, and a Mercedes-Benz. It had grown into an obsession of his. After graduating from Shibaura Institute of Technology Senior High School in March 1975, centering Masayuki Suzuki, the Japanese doo- wop band The Chanels was formed with Tashiro, Nobuyoshi Kuwano and others in the same year.

Later, he was taken in by Chanels member Hiroyuki Kuboki and worked as a clerk for the same filling station. He had lived in the company's dormitory for two years. Afterwards, he became a trucker after he was hired by the president of a truck company, who came as a customer in Tashiro's filling station in 1978. Although he already formed the band, he allegedly kept on working as a trucker because he thought that \\"The entertainment world is scary\\".  Entertainment career  The Chanels and Rats and Star = The Chanels were formed in 1975, and began performing as an amateur band in 1976. They were chosen as a No. 1 band on a Japanese television program called and won a prize in a music contest under the sponsorship of Yamaha. Tashiro made his debut as a member of the group in 1980 and they came to be widely known for adopting rhythm and blues style. 4 members of the front singers including Tashiro wore blackface using shoe polish and they became famous and popular. Their first single, \\"Runaway\\" sold more than 1 million copies. Their May 1981's single \\"Hurricane\\" was covered by Puffy AmiYumi in 2001. In 1983, the group changed its name to Rats & Star because of its similarity with the French brand Chanel. The band practically dissolved in 1986 because the leader Suzuki launched a solo single, . Tashiro, appeared on TV music shows like \\"The Best Ten\\" („Ç∂„Éª„Éô„Çπ„Éà„ÉÜ„É≥) and worked as a lyricist for singer and actress Ky≈çko Koizumi, gaining enough popularity in Japan that he released an LP, as a solo artist. In March 1996, Rats & Star's members got together for six months and covered a member of band Happy End Eiichi Otaki's song in April of the same year. This song recorded a big hit. They also appeared in NHK's K≈çhaku Uta Gassen at New Year's Eve of the year. = Comedian = After Rats & Star broke up, his comedic talent was discovered by Ken Shimura, a member of Japanese comedic group The Drifters, and he became a television comedian.

He appeared in many television commercials, hosted many television programs, wrote an autobiography and a book on puns, directed a movie and starred as the main character in the Famicom/MSX2 action game , released in Japan on October 27, 1989. This video game was not successful at the time it was published. However, after his later scandals and arrests, it started to fetch very high prices on Internet auctions like Yahoo!. He also appeared as a film actor in a Shizuka Ijuin's original work film \\"Cr√™pe\\" in October 1993. He co-starred with an actress Kaho Minami (Ken Watanabe's present wife).  Controversies  Voyeurism = On September 24, 2000, he was sent to the prosecutor's office for filming up a woman's skirt with a camcorder in Tokyu Toyoko Line Toritsudaigaku Station in Meguro, Tokyo. When he was asked why he had done it at a news conference on October 4 of the same year, he claimed that he had been producing a comic film called , a pun on the similar Japanese pronunciations for and and the two meanings of \\"tako\\" (callus and octopus) based on the Japanese saying . The \\"mini ni tako\\" remark became infamous in the Japanese news media. In December 2000, he was fined 50,000 yen (about 430 USD) for the voyeurism. He was barred from working in the entertainment industry temporarily by his entertainment agency, MTM Productions, and his comment was \\"I wish miniskirts were obliterated from the Earth.\\" While he was barred, he did volunteer work such as carrying the wash and serving meals in a nursing home 3 days a week.

It was later found out that he was warned many times by the staff, who became irritated with his habit of sneaking into the ladies' bathroom (possibly with camera equipment) and not emerging again for hours afterwards. Additionally, it was revealed that Fujiwara and other female television stars changed their clothes in the ladies' toilet during the time Tashiro was hiding inside. The staff associated with the show were suspicious that Tashiro did set up a small, transmitting camera in the toilet room. = Drug use = First trial  On December 9, 2001, he was arrested for peeping through the bathroom window of a man's house near his home in Kita-senzoku, ≈åta, Tokyo by Den-en-ch≈çfu police. According to the police, the 32-year-old man who was being spied spotted Tashiro and ran after him for 300 meters wearing only a bath towel around his waist, eventually catching him and delivering him to the station. An eyewitness reported that Tashiro put on a cap like a ski cap, spoke loudly , when he was caught and there was a camcorder in the vicinity of the scene recording. He was released on bail without punishment. However, he was arrested for possession and use of amphetamine on December 12, 2001. The seven police detectives carried out a home search in Tashiro's house as a corroborative investigation into his Peeping Tom incident and discovered a bag containing 0.4 ~ 0.9g of speed. Tashiro stated that, \\"I bought it\\", but how he used it was unknown because a syringe used to inject drugs was not discovered in the home search. He was detained as a suspect at the police station after his arrest until February 1 of the next year. As a result, he was dismissed by MTM Production on the same day because of the repeated scandals. On December 28, 2001, he was prosecuted for the violation of Stimulant Drugs Control Law. He testified that, \\"I used drugs to get rid of stress and tension before appearing on a TV program\\" for the investigation by Tokyo District Prosecution Office. He also said, \\"I lived confined to the house and I began to worry. From about this April, I used it once every few days\\". According to an indictment, he warmed amphetamine over a fire and absorbed it in his home's video room. His first trial for drug use and other crimes was in Tokyo District Court on February 1, 2002. Judgement was given on the case in the same court on February 8, 2002, where he was found guilty. However, he was given 3 years suspended sentence of 2 years imprisonment. In spring 2002, he returned to the entertainment world as director of V-Cinema series such as . In 2003 he made a recorded guest appearance in TBS's on New Year's Eve. This is his last public appearance in a television program to date.  Second trial  After 10 p.m. on September 20, 2004, he was arrested for violation of the Firearms and Swords Control Law in a street in Nakano because he had a butterfly knife with a blade 8 centimeters long. He shared his car on the street with a female acquaintance then and the police questioned them. After the investigation, it was also found out that he had about 2g of amphetamines and about 4g of marijuana in a rucksack. As a result, he was once again arrested for it on the evening of the next day because a woman with him said \\"This rucksack is his\\" and he admitted it, too. After this incident, former Rats & Star member Masayuki Suzuki apologized for Tashiro's crimes in his place. Tashiro stated that the pressure of stardom contributed to his addiction to drugs. Following this arrest, Tashiro was harshly criticized by many of his former co-workers, who said: He was virtually retired from the entertainment world and was treated like he never existed. From here on, the media would refer to him as the \\"former entertainer\\", and all the recordings and pictures taken when he was a Chanels/Rats & Star member were almost never broadcast anymore, and if they were, Tashiro's voice would be lowered to a hush or removed entirely, and no part of his body would show. Newspapers and magazines tacitly agreed not to talk about him at all. In an episode of a comedic duo , host Hikari Ota accidentally said his full name. In , Sayaka Aoki, while displaying only part of his name, said \\"I put a camera in the chest drawer\\", which caused a general laugh. On the other hand, the part of Ken Shimura's commemorative speech held for the release of his program on DVD where he said \\"Have you disappeared like Takafumi Horie when you were knocked-out? I wanted to release this five years ago\\" was not broadcast. He was arrested for possession of amphetamines on September 21, 2004. On February 7, 2005, he was sentenced to 3 years and 6 months imprisonment. On June 26, 2008, he was released from prison.  Cocaine incident  On September 16, 2010, Tashiro was arrested along with a 50-year-old woman in a parking lot at Red Brick Park in Yokohama for possession of cocaine. According to police he was in possession of two bags of cocaine, and admitted \\"It is for my own use\\".in Japanese: (Ëá™ÂàÜ„Åß‰Ωø„ÅÜ„Åü„ÇÅ„Å´ÊåÅ„Å£„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åü)È´™ËñÑ„Åè„ÄÅÈ†¨„Åì„Åë„Åí„Å£„Åù„Çä‚Ä¶ÈÄÆÊçï„ÅÆÁî∞‰ª£„Åæ„Åï„ÅóÂÆπÁñëËÄÖ Tashiro said he bought cocaine from a DJ.Entertainer Tashiro arrested over cocaine possessionThe Yokohama District Public Prosecutors' Office indicted him on October 6, 2010.Entertainer Tashiro Indicted Over Cocaine This incident outraged and disappointed his former co- workers and friends again, and many of them made comments publicly regarding this incident.

Tashiro was released on parole in July 20, 2014. Thereafter, he began his stay at DARC Jeanne (DARC stands for Drug Addiction Rehabilitation Center. Ironically, with Masashi Tashiro being known for his puns, the name of this Rehab Center is also a pun on Jeanne D'Arc). He appeared at a press conference on March 18, 2015, announcing the Opening of the Asagaya Loft A.  2019 arrest  He was arrested again on November 6, 2019 on suspicion of drug use.„ÄêÈÄüÂ†±„Äë63Ê≠≥Áî∞‰ª£„Åæ„Åï„ÅóÂÆπÁñëËÄÖÈÄÆÊçï Ë¶ö„Åõ„ÅÑÂâ§ÊâÄÊåÅ„ÅÆÁñë„ÅÑ„Åß„Åæ„Åü... ‚Äì FNN(November 16, 2019) = Car accident = There was a rumor that Tashiro would be coming back to the public screens in spring 2004. However, he once again found himself in legal trouble for causing a car accident on the ≈åme road in Suginami. According to news reports, at about 1 am on June 16, 2004, he crashed into an 18-year-old vocational school student on a motorcycle after making an illegal U-turn. The victim had his left thigh broken and suffered an injury that would take 2 years to heal completely.  \\"Person of the Year\\" incident In 2001, users of internet forum 2channel voted en-masse Tashiro as Time Magazine's Person of the Year. This act was soon dubbed the \\"Tashiro Festival\\" (Tashiro Matsuri, Áî∞‰ª£Á•≠) by 2ch users. 2channel programmers developed many scripts such as \\"Tashiro Cannon\\" (Tashiro- h≈ç, Áî∞‰ª£Á†≤), \\"Mega particle Tashiro Cannon\\" (Mega-ry≈´shi Tashiro-h≈ç, „É°„Ç¨Á≤íÂ≠êÁî∞‰ª£Á†≤), \\"25 repeated blows Tashiro Cannon\\" (Nij≈´-go renda Tashiro-h≈ç, 25ÈÄ£ÊâìÁî∞‰ª£Á†≤) \\"Super Tashiro Cannon\\" (Ch≈ç Tashiro-h≈ç, Ë∂ÖÁî∞‰ª£Á†≤) to be able to vote repeatedly. \\"Super Tashiro cannon\\" was so powerful that it crashed Time's server. Afterwards, \\"Satellite Cannon -Tashiro-\\" was developed, but it was not deployed. Due to the votes of 2channel users, he got to the No. 1 position temporarily on December 21, 2001. However, Time's staff realized that something was unusual, and Tashiro was removed as a candidate.

Within each category there are two or more possible values (sometimes called grammemes), which are normally mutually exclusive. Frequently encountered grammatical categories include: * tense, the placing of a verb in a time frame, which can take values such as present and past * number, with values such as singular, plural, and sometimes dual, trial, paucal, uncountable or partitive, inclusive or exclusive * gender, with values such as masculine, feminine and neuter * noun classes, which are more general than just gender, and include additional classes like: animated, humane, plants, animals, things, and immaterial for concepts and verbal nouns/actions, sometimes as well shapes * locative relations, which some languages would represent using grammatical cases or tenses, or by adding a possibly agglutinated lexeme such as a preposition, adjective, or particle. Although the use of terms varies from author to author, a distinction should be made between grammatical categories and lexical categories. Lexical categories (considered syntactic categories) largely correspond to the parts of speech of traditional grammar, and refer to nouns, adjectives, etc. A phonological manifestation of a category value (for example, a word ending that marks \\"number\\" on a noun) is sometimes called an exponent. Grammatical relations define relationships between words and phrases with certain parts of speech, depending on their position in the syntactic tree. Traditional relations include subject, object, and indirect object. Assignment and meaning A given constituent of an expression can normally take only one value in each category. For example, a noun or noun phrase cannot be both singular and plural, since these are both values of the \\"number\\" category. It can, however, be both plural and feminine, since these represent different categories (number and gender). Categories may be described and named with regard to the type of meanings that they are used to express. For example, the category of tense usually expresses the time of occurrence (e.g. past, present or future). However, purely grammatical features do not always correspond simply or consistently to elements of meaning, and different authors may take significantly different approaches in their terminology and analysis. For example, the meanings associated with the categories of tense, aspect and mood are often bound up in verb conjugation patterns that do not have separate grammatical elements corresponding to each of the three categories; see Tense‚Äìaspect‚Äìmood. Manifestation of categories Categories may be marked on words by means of inflection. In English, for example, the number of a noun is usually marked by leaving the noun uninflected if it is singular, and by adding the suffix -s if it is plural (although some nouns have irregular plural forms). On other occasions, a category may not be marked overtly on the item to which it pertains, being manifested only through other grammatical features of the sentence, often by way of grammatical agreement. For example: > The bird can sing. The birds can sing. In the above sentences, the number of the noun is marked by the absence or presence of the ending -s. > The sheep is running. The sheep are running. In the above, the number of the noun is not marked on the noun itself (sheep does not inflect according to the regular pattern), but it is reflected in agreement between the noun and verb: singular number triggers is, and plural number are. > The bird is singing. The birds are singing. In this case the number is marked overtly on the noun, and is also reflected by verb agreement. However: > The sheep can run. In this case the number of the noun (or of the verb) is not manifested at all in the surface form of the sentence, and thus ambiguity is introduced (at least, when the sentence is viewed in isolation). Exponents of grammatical categories often appear in the same position or \\"slot\\" in the word (such as prefix, suffix or enclitic). An example of this is the Latin cases, which are all suffixal: rosa, rosae, rosae, rosam, rosƒÅ (\\"rose\\", in the nominative, genitive, dative, accusative and ablative). Categories can also pertain to sentence constituents that are larger than a single word (phrases, or sometimes clauses). A phrase often inherits category values from its head word; for example, in the above sentences, the noun phrase the birds inherits plural number from the noun birds. In other cases such values are associated with the way in which the phrase is constructed; for example, in the coordinated noun phrase Tom and Mary, the phrase has plural number (it would take a plural verb), even though both the nouns from which it is built up are singular.  Grammatical category of noun  In traditional structural grammar, grammatical categories are semantic distinctions; this is reflected in a morphological or syntactic paradigm. But in generative grammar, which sees meaning as separate from grammar, they are categories that define the distribution of syntactic elements.Joan Bybee \\"Irrealis\\" as a Grammatical Category. Anthropological Linguistics , Vol. 40, No. 2 (Summer, 1998), pp. 257-271 For structuralists such as Roman Jakobson grammatical categories were lexemes that were based on binary oppositions of \\"a single feature of meaning that is equally present in all contexts of use\\". Another way to define a grammatical category is as a category that expresses meanings from a single conceptual domain, contrasts with other such categories, and is expressed through formally similar expressions.What is a grammatical category? - SIL.org Another definition distinguishes grammatical categories from lexical categories, such that the elements in a grammatical category have a common grammatical meaning ‚Äì that is, they are part of the language's grammatical structure.\\"grammatical category\\" The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Linguistics.

Background  Flores Facuss√© is the son of Honduran journalist Oscar Flores Midence and Margarita Facuss√© de Flores, and is of Palestinian descent. He is the nephew of Miguel Facuss√© Barjum. He, his brother Oscar Flores and his sister Celsa Flores, an artist, all attended the American School of Tegucigalpa. He then earned a dual degree in industrial engineering and international economics and finance from Louisiana State University. He became a member of Phi Iota Alpha. Soon after completing his master's degree he returned to Honduras, where he began managing the family business (the newspaper La Tribuna) and participating in private and public committees, including the Honduran Central Bank and the Institute of Social Security. Political career During the 1970s, Flores became involved in Honduran political life, joining the Liberal Party. He later became a congressman, representing the department (political division equivalent to a province) of Francisco Moraz√°n. He served as Minister of the Presidency under the rule of Liberal president Roberto Suazo from 1982 to 1984. In the 1989 general election he ran for the presidency, eventually losing to Rafael Leonardo Callejas, the candidate of the National Party. In 1994, Flores became president of the National Congress, serving until 1998.http://www.xplorhonduras.com/presidentes-del-congreso-nacional-1900-2014/ = 1997 Honduran general election = Flores won the 1997 general election, defeating Nora Melgar Castro of the National Party. He served as president of Honduras from 1998 to 2002. = Presidency of Honduras (1998-2002) = Carlos Flores with United States President Bill Clinton During Carlos Flores' presidency, Honduras was struck by Hurricane Mitch, one of the worst natural disasters in decades. It caused thousands of deaths and left the national economy in shambles. President Flores solicited international aid from several financial institutions and countries. The response was strong, and funds were directed at reinforcing Honduras' infrastructure and the agricultural and industrial economic sectors. As recommended by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Flores imposed strict financial guidelines: deflationary monetary fund policies, fiscal austerity, and privatization of the airports and the national communications company, Hondutel, the latter with mixed outcome. He also limited the power held by the military forces, forcing them to relinquish some power to the presidency. On 26 August 1998, Flores instituted the Ministry of Public Security under the provisions of the National Plan to combat crime and criminality. This was a response to the ominous growth of violent gangs, particularly the Mara Salvatrucha. Government initiatives in this area did not produce significant results, and completely ignored murderous activity in the country, particularly the actions of a series of armed death squads that extrajudicially killed homeless children and adolescents living in the margins of society. Reports from Human Rights Commission United Nations, the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras (CODEH) and other NGOs indicate that the casualties caused by such violence on children barely improved during the four years of Flores' presidency. Personal life Flores is married to Mary Flake de Flores, whom he met while a student at Louisiana State University. Their daughter, Mary Elizabeth Flores Flake, is the permanent representative of Honduras to the United Nations.

It was never put into service, but the principles formed the basis for several post-war developments by the Allies. A 30 mm version was developed as the MG 213C or MK 213 and it was this that led to the British ADEN, French DEFA and American M39 cannon.https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1955/1955%20-%200109.PDF Operation The gun was developed by Mauser but, as far as known, was never deployed. It was developed from an earlier design: the MG 213A. The MG 213A utilized a gas-driven operation. In the MG 213, the direct movement of the revolver cassette was changed to a diagonal cam with a follower. This actuated a rammer that both fed cartridges into the cylinders and revolved the cassette. Sealing was accomplished by packing the cylinder and breech with heat resistant steel. This innovation allowed chamber movement while the gas pressure was very high. The revolver cassette had five chambershttps://www.bevfitchett.us/heavy-machine-guns/revolver-cannon.html and at least 3 chambers were full during operation, feeding, firing, and extracting. The cylinder was fed at the 5 o'clock position and fired at the 12 o'clock position. Upon discovery of examples of the gun, it caught the attention of autocannon developers in Switzerland, France, Britain, and the US.

Nowadays, this poetry is considered to be jingoistic,Jon Stallworthy \\"Owen, Wilfred (Edward Salter)\\", The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry in English, Ian Hamilton, Oxford University Press, 1996.Women's Poetry of the First World War, Nosheen Khan, University Press of Kentucky, 1988, consisting of simple rhythms and rhyme schemes, with extensive use of rhetorical questions to persuade (and sometimes pressure) young men to join the war.

Pope was widely published during the war, apart from newspaper publication producing three volumes: Jessie Pope's War Poems (1915), More War Poems (1915) and Simple Rhymes for Stirring Times (1916).The Works of Wilfred Owen, Wilfred Owen, ed. Douglas Kerr, Wordsworth Editions, 1994, =Criticism= Her treatment of the subject is markedly in stark contrast to the anti-war stance of soldier poets such as Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. Many of these men found her work distasteful, Owen in particular. His poem Dulce et Decorum Est was a direct response to her writing, originally dedicated \\"To Jessie Pope etc.\\". A later draft amended this as \\"To a certain Poetess\\", later being removed completely to turn the poem into a general reproach on anyone sympathetic to the war.The Old Lie: The Great War and the Public-school Ethos, Peter Parker, Constable, 1987 Pope is prominently remembered first for her pro-war poetry, but also as a representative of homefront female propagandists such as Mrs Humphry Ward, May Wedderburn Cannan, Emma Orczy, and entertainers such as Vesta Tilley.Michael Duffy. Women and WWI: Feminist and Non-Feminist Women: Between Collaboration and Pacifist Resistance, 25 February 2006 In particular, the poem \\"War Girls\\", similar in structure to her pro-war poetry, states how \\"No longer caged and penned up/They're going to keep their end up/Until the khaki soldier boys come marching back\\". Though largely unknown at the time, the War poets like Nichols, Sassoon and Owen, as well as later writers such as Edmund Blunden, Robert Graves, and Richard Aldington, have come to define the experience of the First World War.For the creation of the modern image of World War I see Paul Fussell. The Great War and Modern Memory. Oxford University Press, (2000) =Reappraisal= Pope's work is today often presented in schools and anthologies as a counterpoint to the work of the War Poets, a comparison by which her pro-war work suffers both technically and politically. Some writers have attempted a partial re-appraisal of her work as an early pioneer of English women in the workforce, while still critical of both the content and artistic merit of her war poetry. Reminded that Pope was primarily a humourist and writer of light verse, her success in publishing and journalism during the pre-war era, when she was described as the \\"foremost woman humourist\\" of her day has been overshadowed by her propagandistic war poems. Her verse has been mined for sympathetic portrayals of the poor and powerless, of women urged to be strong and self-reliant.Esther MacCallum- Stewart.

During the war he played an important role in the Western theatre, earning high approval from General Ulysses Grant, and uncovered a secret plot for an uprising in Indiana. As governor, he launched several legal challenges to the Indiana General Assembly's removal of his powers, but was mostly unsuccessful. He successfully advocated election reform before he died in office. Early lifeFamily and background= Alvin Peterson Hovey was born in Mount Vernon, Indiana, on September 6, 1821, to Abiel and Francis Hovey. His mother died while he was a young boy, and his father died when he was fifteen leaving him orphaned. His youth was spent in poverty, and after being sent to an orphanage following his father's death, he received a basic education before being turned out at age eighteen. Hovey wanted to become a lawyer, and went work as a bricklayer by day, and studied law at night in the office of John Pitcher, a Mount Vernon attorney in 1840. After over three years of study in the office, he was admitted to bar in 1843 and opened his own law office.Gugin, p. 190 Hovey was propelled into the state spotlight in 1849 when he was appointed to oversee the estate of the deceased William McClure. McClure was a wealthy idealist who was one of the co-founders of the failed utopian settlement of New Harmony, Indiana. In his will, he ordered that his estate be sold and the proceeds be used to fund the construction of libraries. His two siblings had already seized much of his estate, sold it, and made off with the funds. Hovey filed over sixty lawsuits to reclaim the assets of the estate, and use the proceeds for their intended purpose. The estate successfully funded the opening of 160 libraries in Indiana and Illinois. The case gained considerable press coverage around Indiana, and Hovey gained considerable popularity from his success.Gugin, p. 191 He met and married his wife Mary Ann in 1844, and the couple had five children. Only two of the children survived infancy. =Constitutionalist= Hovey was elected as a Democrat to serve as a delegate in 1850 to help create a new constitution for the state of Indiana. Hovey supported the educational and governmental reforms to the constitution, as well as being a driving force in some of the more controversial aspects of the constitution. He opposed the extension of suffrage to women and blacks, and proposed adding a section to the constitution to ban free blacks from Indiana. His proposal was accepted because it was viewed as a punishment to the southern states, who would be required to care for the free blacks. He also opposed the bankruptcy reforms, saying that it would grant too much protection from creditors, and encourage laziness.Gugin, p. 192 The constitution was approved by the public, but the anti-black portions were ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court two years later. In 1854, Hovey was appointed by Governor Joseph A. Wright to fill a vacancy on the Indiana Supreme Court until an election could be held. At the time of his appointment, he was 34, making him the youngest justice in the history of the court. It also made him the only constitutional delegate to become the interpreter of a document which he himself had helped write. His most important decision was in voting to strike down taxing laws created by some townships to increase funding for their schools. His decision stated that the constitution required all state schools be funded uniformly. He campaigned to be elected to the Supreme Court, but was defeated having only served six months on the court. In 1855, Hovey was appointed by United States President Franklin Pierce to serve as US Attorney for Indiana. The state Democratic party had been going through a period of internal problems over the slavery issue. The pro-slavery faction, led by Jesse D. Bright, expelled many anti- slavery members of the party including Hovey during the 1858 state convention. Bright was able to influence President James Buchanan to remove Hovey from office because of his position. Hovey responded by running for Congress against Democrat William E. Niblack as an Independent, but was defeated by a large margin. Hovey then joined the Republican Party, along with many of the other expelled Democrats. American Civil WarFront lines= Immediately following the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Hovey was commissioned as a colonel and organized the First Regiment of the Indiana Legion, a militia force that was used to defend the state during the war. Shortly thereafter, he was appointed colonel of the 24th Regiment Indiana Infantry. His regiment was quickly sent to the front-lines where he led it in the Battle of Shiloh in 1862. He remained with the advance elements of the main western Union army, and was promoted to brigadier general of United States Volunteers. During the siege of Corinth he commanded the 1st Brigade in Lew Wallace's 3rd Division. Hovey briefly commanded the District of Eastern Arkansas during the Fall of 1862 but returned to brigade command in the Army of the Tennessee in 1863. In January he was given command of the 12th Division in the XIII Corps. He led his division at the Battle of Champion Hill later that year earning the praise of General Ulysses S. Grant. He again led his division in the Siege of Vicksburg, breaking Confederate control of the Mississippi River. Grant again praised Hovey as key to the siege's success. Shortly after the battle, he received word that his wife had died, and returned home to arrange for guardians for his children. Her death was deeply saddening to Hovey who was slow to recover emotionally. He returned briefly to the front in 1864 to the 1st Division in the XXIII Corps division during the Atlanta Campaign. In August 1864 the 1st Division was discontinued and its regiments dispersed throughout the other divisions in the XXIII Corps. Hovey, without a command, again returned home.Gugin, p. 193 For the remainder of the war he was in command of the military District of Indiana. He resigned from the Union Army on October 7, 1865. =Sons of Liberty= Back in Indiana, Governor Oliver P. Morton placed Hovey in command of the Regular army and Indiana Legions units in the state. His primary task was overseeing recruitment and keeping anti-government activities under control. To accomplish the task, Hovey raised a division of ten-thousand troops, but would only accept unmarried men. Because of the young age of most of his soldiers, his division was nicknamed \\"Hovey's Babies.\\" His investigations uncovered a network of southern sympathizers known as the Sons of Liberty and the Knights of the Golden Circle. He alleged the group had secret plans for an uprising in Indianapolis in August 1864. To prevent the plot, he had dozens of suspects arrested and taken before military tribunals for judgment. Several were sentenced to hanging, but their terms were commuted to life in prison. After the war, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the trials unconstitutional in the case of Ex parte Milligan. After the war ended, Hovey was brevetted as a major general before resigning from the army. He then remarried to Rosa Alice, the stepdaughter of Caleb B. Smith, in 1865. He was then appointed as Minister to Peru and dispatched to the country. Just prior to his departure, his new wife fell ill and died. During his time in Peru, the country was constantly at war with its neighbors and undergoing violent revolution. Hovey spent a good deal of his time trying to determine who was running the country on any given day. In 1870 he resigned from his post and returned to Mount Vernon where he resumed his law practice.Gugin. p. 194 GovernorClash with General Assembly= In 1872, the Republican party entered Hovey's name as a candidate to run for governor, but he declined, claiming he was finished with politics. For the next fourteen years he continued operating his private law practice until 1886, he was nominated to run for Congress and accepted. He defeated his Democratic opponent J. E. McCullough 18,258 to 16,907. Two years later, he was nominated to run for Governor of Indiana. Benjamin Harrison was running for President that year and was immensely popular in the state. Despite his party ticket's popularity, he barely won the election, defeating Democrat Courtland C. Matson by a plurality, 49%‚Äì48.6% of the vote, and Democrats retained majorities in both houses of the Indiana General Assembly. At age sixty-eight, Hovey became the oldest man ever elected governor, up until that time. In the last year of the term of Hovey's predecessor, Governor Albert G. Porter, the General Assembly had passed a series of laws weakening the governor's powers. The legislature pursued an agenda for the most part differing from the Governor's, and overrode most of his symbolic vetoes to enact it. Hovey attempted to reclaim some of the power taken by the legislature by taking many of their recent laws to the courts. They had removed all the governor's appointment powers, and the Indiana Supreme Court ruled in favor of the legislature in that matter. In another case, where the assembly had created state boards to run police, fire, and other departments at the local level, taking their control from Republican-controlled local governments, the courts ruled in favor of Hovey and declared the laws unconstitutional. In a fight over who had the right to appoint newly created department heads, the court ruled against both the assembly and the governor, stating that like all other departments heads must be elected in a general election.Gugin, p. 195 =Reforms= The only agenda item which Hovey was able to pass through the General Assembly was voter reform. The state for several election cycles had been the victim of serious voter fraud, and had among the least restrictive voter regulations in the nation. Parties created their own ballots, and were responsible for including their opponents on their ballots. This led to considerable trickery on the part of the parties who would deliberately make their ballot in a manner to increase the likelihood voters would choose their candidate, even accidentally. Vote buying had also become commonplace; that had led to a national scandal in the election of Benjamin Harrison. The reforms enacted created the secret ballot, standardized ballots, provided more supervision at polling stations, and gave the responsibility of creating ballots to the state. Hovey had campaigned on dealing with the White Cap groups operating in southern Indiana. The vigilante groups had carried out several lynchings, including the Reno Gang, and had been carrying out other forms of vigilante justice, especially in Harrison and Crawford Counties. They often meted out corporeal punishments to men who were believed to not be taking care of their family, local criminals, and alcoholics. Hovey launched investigations into the groups, and made known his intentions to put an end to their organizations. Although no arrests were made, the threat led to a significant decrease and eventual end to their activities. Death In 1891, Hovey fell ill and died on November 23, 1891, and was succeeded by his Lieutenant Governor Ira Joy Chase. Hovey's body lay in state in Indianapolis before his remains were removed to his hometown for a funeral. He is buried in the Bellefontaine Cemetery near Mount Vernon, Indiana.Gugin, p. 196 Electoral historySee also * List of Governors of Indiana * List of American Civil War generals (Union) References Notes Bibliography * * External links * Civil War Indiana biography of Hovey * Biography of Hovey Retrieved on 2008-02-12 * Indiana Historical Bureau: Biography and portrait * NY Times obituary * Home and resting place * Category:1821 births Category:1891 deaths Category:People from Mount Vernon, Indiana Category:Indiana Republicans Category:Governors of Indiana Category:Union Army generals Category:Justices of the Indiana Supreme Court Category:People of Indiana in the American Civil War Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Indiana Category:People from Indiana in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Category:Delegates to the 1851 Indiana constitutional convention Category:Ambassadors of the United States to Peru Category:Republican Party state governors of the United States Category:19th- century American diplomats Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:United States Attorneys for the District of Indiana Category:People who died in office Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"Alvin Peterson Hovey"},{"id":"1625747","text":"Karin Larsen may refer to: *Britt Karin Larsen (born 1945), Norwegian poet *Karin Larsen (broadcaster) (born 1963), Canadian CBC television newscaster and former Olympic synchronized swimmer *Karin Larsen (Communist Party candidate), Canadian political candidate ","title":"Karin Larsen"},{"id":"1625755","text":"First territory (\\"Petersland\\") claimed by the German East Africa Company 1885 The German East Africa Company (, abbreviated DOAG) was a chartered colonial organization which brought about the establishment of German East Africa, a territory which eventually comprised the areas of modern Tanzania, Burundi, and Rwanda. https://books.google.com The Company originated in 1884 as the Gesellschaft f√ºr deutsche Kolonisation (Society for German Colonisation) with the aim of trading in Africa. The German protectorate of Wituland (within modern Kenya) originated as a separate German sphere of influence in 1885. In April of the same year, the company leased the coastal strip opposite Zanzibar from Sultan Khalifa bin Said for 50 years. Its attempt to take over the administration led to a general revolt along the coast of what is now Tanzania. The company could only hold Dar es Salaam and Bagamoyo with the help of the German navy. In 1889 it had to request the assistance of the German government to put down the rebellion. In 1891, after it became apparent that the company could not handle its dominions, it sold out to the German government, which began to rule German East Africa directly. The company initially continued to operate its many activities, including mines, plantations, railways, banking, minting, etc., before it consented to relinquish them to the German colonial administration and other organizations. It subsequently operated as a land company within the German territory until Britain occupied German East Africa during World War I. The featured a stylised representation of the constellation of the Southern Cross. Founding One of the reasons for the formation of the German East Africa Company was politics occurring inside Germany. According to the ‚ÄúKolonialpolitischer F√ºhrer‚Äù, German Imperialism was conceived in the 1850s when the growth of the economy due to industrialization caused German businessmen to look beyond Germany for business prospects. Later in the century, a newly unified Germany had to take a part in the exploration and expansion overseas if it were to be among the world‚Äôs leading imperial powers. Being a large manufacturing country that both bought and sold goods, it had made sure its stake in resources was guarded. Gustav Schmoller, an economist, had a desire for a large naval fleet which was linked to this very idea of expanding the empire. Twenty million people were estimated to have moved to Germany from other countries in the 1900s, and the colonies would be a good place to hold some of the population. The leaders of the country made an effort to show the German people how the industry and its workers prospered from German imperialism.Grimmer-Solem, Erik. \\"The Professors' Africa: Economists, the Elections of 1907, and the Legitimation of German Imperialism.\\" German History (July 2007): 313-347.

Products available from Africa were important imports to Germany, and one view of the era was that the most important resource of Africa was the native people. At the end of the 19th century, the Eastern Arc Mountains became important areas of research. Reginald Moreau and Adolf Engler wrote important publications on the area‚Äôs plant and animal life.Conte, Christopher A. \\"Forest History in East Africa's Eastern Arc Mountains: Biological Science and the Uses of History.\\" Bioscience (April 2010): 309-313.

Operations Mining took place in all three countries the German East African Company occupied. ‚ÄúFrom 13,000 to 16,000 were engaged in railway construction, and 3000 were in mining.‚Äù They were exporting many different types of goods, such as coffee, rubber, to Europe. In addition, they were building roads and railways by felling trees to connect the three countries where their company was operating. People involved in the companyCarl Peters= Carl Peters was born on September 27, 1856, in Hanover, Germany. Peters was awarded scholarships to attend college, where he studied history, philosophy, and law, and became a successful journalist.Boddy-Evans, Alistar ‚ÄúBiography: Carl Peters,‚Äù American History from About, http://africanhistory.about.com/cs/biography/p/bio_peters.htm (accessed July 27, 2010). After some time, Peters became interested in colonization, and he then changed his focus in life to become one of the principal founders of the German East Africa Company. He made significant contributions towards the company, which made him a widely recognized explorer. For example, Peters convinced the indigenous peoples of East Africa to give Germany control of their land, allowing Germany to have a colony in East Africa. He was able to do this by impressing the natives by firing guns, wearing impressive clothing, and flying flags.Pesek, Michael, ‚ÄúThe Boma and the Peripatetic Ruler‚Äù Western Folklore, 233‚Äì257, [database on-line]; available from Historical Abstracts. After the Germans took control, Peters became the administrator of the region until his dismissal because of his brutal treatment of the natives. He was known by the natives as Mkono wa Damu, meaning ‚Äúthe man with blood on his hands‚Äù. He was put on trial and found guilty, although the decision was criticized by the German press. His ill- treatment of the indigenous people earned him an end to his otherwise successful career, and because of the extreme negative response, he lost most of his prestige ‚Äî there are still streets named after him, but he is neglected by most historians.Schneppen, Heinz, ‚ÄúThe case of Carl Peters: a colonial official on trial‚Äù Zeitschrift f√ºr Geschichtswissenschaft, 869-885, [database on-line]; available from Historical Abstracts. =Hermann von Wissmann= Hermann von Wissmann was born on September 4, 1853, in Frankfurt, Germany. He joined the Army, and after just four years, he became a lieutenant. Wissmann was later involved in a duel for which he was sentenced to jail, but this was not all a negative, because he met an African explorer with whom he traveled to Africa. While in Africa with the explorer, Wissmann became associated with the German East Africa Company, and he obtained high recognition from the leaders in that region. Eventually, an uprising of the indigenous people against the German occupation occurred, and Wissmann, with his extensive background in the military, became essential to fight the rebellion. He was extremely successful in his military operations, and in a little time, he was able to silence the rebels and revive German control.Morlang, Thomas. ‚ÄúPersonen,‚Äù KopfWelten, http://www.kopfwelten.org/kp/personen/wissmann, (accessed July 25, 2010). After the rebellion, Wissmann went on to colonize the rest of the German colony until he returned to Germany. Contrary to Carl Peters, Wissmann reportedly treated the indigenous with respect: he insisted on fairness, respect for customs, and use of Swahili (the native language).Wright, Marcia, ‚ÄúLocal Roots of Policy in German East Africa,‚Äù Journal of African History, 621-630, [database on-line]; available from Historical Abstracts. Some consider him ‚ÄúGermany‚Äôs Greatest African‚Äù, and because of that, several monuments were erected to commemorate his accomplishments.Zeller, Joachim, ‚Äú‚ÄôGermany's greatest African‚Äô: the history of the monuments to Hermann von Wissmann‚Äù Zeitschrift f√ºr Geschichtswissenschaft, 1089-1111, [database on-line]; available from Historical Abstracts. =Julius von Soden= Julius von Soden is not as highly recognized as other people involved in the German East Africa Company, but he did bring an important item to East Africa ‚Äî schooling. Soden was a governor of German East Africa, and in 1892, he established the first school. Soden felt that a school for boys, free of religious influences, would greatly help the German presence in Africa. Instead of forcing the native people to work or taking over their land, Soden brought a positive to this underdeveloped area to help it grow.Gerhard, Taddey, ‚ÄúFounding of the first German school in East Africa,‚Äù Zeitschrift f√ºr W√ºrttembergische Landesgeschichte, 415-422, [database on-line]; available from Historical Abstracts. =Eduard von Liebert= Eduard von Liebert Similar to Soden, Eduard von Liebert also helped develop East Africa‚Äôs infrastructure. Under the command of Liebert, East Africa was able to develop hospitals, social facilities, railroads, and more. The railroads, however, were arguably the most important of these. East Africa was able to produce a large surplus of agricultural products, and now these goods could be shipped to markets. At the time, railroads were necessary to industrial growth, so with the German contributions, the countries of East Africa had a head start industrialising over nearby regions. This large project took many years to finish; it was completed in 1914 ‚Äì 29 years after the beginning of the German colonization. =Tom von Prince= Tom von Prince was born on January 9, 1866, to the British police governor of the British island colony of Mauritius and a German mother. With the death of his father, the mother returned to Germany (Silesia), and entered Tom in an academy for young Prussian male aristocrats. Since Europe was quiet and offered no military advancement, he finally joined Wissmann's Kaiserliche Schutztruppe (called the Wissmann Truppe) and liked seeing himself as a hero. By 1890, Tom von Prince was involved in German East Africa as a lieutenant attempting to control 'the Street of Caravans' under control of the Wissmann Truppe. Emil von Zelewski Since the Hehe, under Mquawa, had only attacked and harassed the Germans, leading to the loss of Commander Emil von Zelewski and many of his men, Tom Prince was sent far inland to Lake Nyassa, with a civilian representative of the Antislavery Committee, Wynecken. Here he met Wissmann, who lent him Bauer, the Wissmann's safari leader. The three, Prince, Wynecken, and Bauer, were to encircle the Hehe under Mqwawa, with the help of less than 20 Atongas and a few hundred Sangu, enemy of the Hehe. =Others= While it is important to go into detail about the more significant and accomplished people involved in the company, it is also necessary to realize that a handful of people could not run the company on their own. Many governors ‚Äî other than the ones listed above ‚Äî allowed it to run smoothly throughout the German occupation: Friedrich Radbod von Schele, Gustav Adolf von G√∂tzen, Georg Albrecht von Rechenberg, and Heinrich Schnee. As well as governors, many other people helped operate the colony: soldiers who fought to allow Germany to have a colony in Africa, and all of the other people who worked there on a day-to-day basis. Although most of the credit for founding the company and colony is given to a select number of people, none of it would be possible without the collective efforts of everyone in the company.‚ÄúGerman East Africa,‚Äù nTZ: An Information Resource for Northern Tanzania, http://www.ntz. info/gen/n00796.html (accessed July 26, 2010).

Later, in a version with Bud Shank on alto saxBruce Babcock (2009), Interview with Earle Hagen, it was used as the theme for television's Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer, and The New Mike Hammer. He began teaching trombone in the 1930s in order to make extra money. In 1940, he went to work for CBS as a staff musician, then enlisted in the military in 1941. Hagen was an orchestrator and arranger for motion picture studio 20th Century Fox in the 1940s and early 1950s, and worked on films like Call Me Madam, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and Carousel. He began writing for television when he left Fox in 1952 with partner Herbert W. Spencer. The two did the musical score for Janis Paige's short-lived situation comedy, It's Always Jan, which aired in the 1955‚Äì1956 season on CBS. Hagen met television show producer Sheldon Leonard when he scored the Danny Thomas series Make Room for Daddy. Hagen's most ambitious body of work, however, came from his work on I Spy, for which he won an Emmy in 1968. Sheldon Leonard, the producer and creator of I Spy, bucked the trend of using canned music for television shows and instead decided to create original soundtracks for every episode. Since every episode of I Spy was set in a different location, Hagen made liberal use of world music in his soundtracks which were mostly written and performed within the West coast jazz genre. (Hagen did not claim the West coast jazz affiliation for himself, instead inventing the term \\"semi-jazz,\\" which he defined as a union of global themes with American jazz.) Other television theme songs that Hagen composed were the themes for My Sister Eileen, The Dick Van Dyke Show, Gomer Pyle ‚Äì USMC, That Girl (along with I Spy, Thomas and Leonard productions), and The Mod Squad.Jacket cover, TeeVee Toons Presents, Television's Greatest Hits (TeeVee Toons, Inc., 1985) He was the in-house composer on the fondly remembered 1970s series Eight Is Enough (1977‚Äì1981). At the end of his life he continued teaching and wrote books on music arranging and scoring. Sometimes his only fee was a box of golf balls because of his passion for golfing. He wrote one of the first textbooks on scoring, Scoring for Films: A Complete Text. In 2000, he published his autobiography, Memoirs of a Famous Composer Nobody Ever Heard Of.

Negt is most-well known for his long running collaboration with the filmmaker and visual artist Alexander Kluge.  Biography  Negt was the youngest child of seven, and his father was involved in the Social Democratic Party (SDP) during World War II, who faced pressure under Nazi rule. In 1944, Negt was separated from his parents and displaced to Denmark following the Red Army's invasion of K√∂nigsberg. During his stay in Denmark, Negt and two of his older sisters stayed in an internment camp for two and a half years, until which the camp doors were finally reopened and Negt and his sisters were reunited with their parents in Russian occupied Berlin, after having been placed in quarantine near Rostock on their return to Germany. It was during this time that Negt's childhood was deeply affected, missing out on early development with no exposure to childhood schooling. In 1951, the political pressure mounted on Negt's family from the state, due to his father's involvement in the SDP, Negt's family fled to West Berlin, where they would spend a further 6 months as asylum seekers. In 1955, the Negt family settled into Oldenburg in Lower Saxony. In 1955 Negt arrived in Gottingen to study law, but found the commitments entailed by membership in the local Burschenschaft overly burdensome. He later left, joined the Socialist German Students' Union (SDS), and enrolled in the Universit√§t Frankfurt (now Goethe University Frankfurt) for the study of sociology and philosophy. It is here that he encountered Max Horkheimer and Adorno, then finally Habermas who was impressed with one of Negt's class papers. Negt was later offered a place as a research assistant for Habermas (on the topic of Marxism and the SDS) at the University of Heidelberg in 1961. In 1968 Negt upset his mentor Habermas by editing a collection of essays on him (titled The Left answers Jurgen Habermas), some of which were highly critical. Negt published his autobiography in two instalments in 2016 and 2019, titled respectively √úberlebensgl√ºck (Survivors‚Äô Luck: An Autobiographical Search for Tracks) and Erfahrungsspuren (Tracks of Experience: An Autobiographical Thought-Journey). He also collaborated with the filmmaker Alexander Kluge on three films about post-socialist Europe. Negt's work with Kluge has been described as \\"highly unconventional\\" but significant in \\"an attempt to reinstate the human body to its rightful place in critical theory.\\"  Intellectual influences  Negt's work is said to be difficult to classify due to the enormous range of influences found in it from so many texts and philosophers. These include Immanuel Kant, Freidrich Hegel, Karl Marx, Auguste Comte, and some of the major Western Marxists. He draws on work in labour sociology, organizational theory, political journalism and more. Negt's primary concerns relate to labor, teaching, and politics. Negt was brought up as the son of a small farmer and a member of the Social Democratic Party, and this \\"rural and... proletarian existence\\" led him to have ties with SPD causes, including trade unions. These experiences led him to feel that while standard education for union members in metal working factories in Germany was sufficient for teaching legal questions, it was insufficient in political education. Negt thus understands genuine education to be inherently political, because democracy must be learned, making education existential for a democratic society. Negt is thus suspicious of the ideology and logic of capital and the market replacing all other forms of social reality. This informs Negt's views on education as the holistic development of the person, limited not only to \\"processing knowledge and information\\" but also the ability to deal with emotions, to compromise, negotiate, and share with others. Thus for Negt, \\"good political education\\" means that the student can \\"think for themselves.\\" = Work with Alexander Kluge = Oskar Negt's most well-known public interventions in politics have been part of his collaboration with the artist Alexander Kluge. Their seminal work Public Sphere and Experience was an analysis of the limits of the bourgeois public sphere.

The word Sibyl comes (via Latin) from the ancient Greek word sibylla, meaning prophetess. There were many Sibyls in the ancient world, but the Libyan Sibyl, in Classical mythology, foretold the \\"coming of the day when that which is hidden shall be revealed.\\" In Pausanias Description of Greece, the sibyl names her parents in her oracles: :I am by birth half mortal, half divine; :An immortal nymph was my mother, my father an eater of grain; :On my mother's side of Idaean birth, but my fatherland was red :Marpessus, sacred to the Mother, and the river Aidoneus. (Pausanias 10.12.3) The Greeks say she was the daughter of Zeus and Lamia a daughter of Poseidon. Euripides mentions the Libyan Sibyl in the prologue of the Lamia. The Greeks further state that she was the first woman to chant oracles, she lived most of her life in Samos, and that the name Sibyl was given her by the Libyans. Serapion, in his epic verses, says that the Sibyl, even when dead ceased not from divination. And he writes that, what proceeded from her into the air after her death, was what gave oracular utterances in voices and omens; and on her body being changed into earth, and the grass as natural growing out of it, whatever beasts happening to be in that place fed on it exhibited to men an accurate knowledge of futurity by their entrails. He thinks also, that the face seen in the moon is her soul.Clement of Alexandria. The Stromata, or Miscellanies, Book I, Chap XV Plutarch tells the story of Alexander the Great after founding Alexandria, he marched to Siwa Oasis and the sibyl is said to have confirmed him as both a divine personage and the legitimate Pharaoh of Egypt.

In addition, value-pluralism postulates that in many cases, such incompatible values may be incommensurable, in the sense that there is no objective ordering of them in terms of importance. Value pluralism is opposed to value monism. Value- pluralism is a theory in metaethics, rather than a theory of normative ethics, or a set of values in itself. Oxford philosopher and historian of ideas Isaiah Berlin is credited with being the first to popularize a substantial work describing the theory of objective value-pluralism, bringing it to the attention of academia (cf. the Isaiah Berlin Virtual Library). The related idea that fundamental values can and, in some cases, do conflict with each other is prominent in the thought of Max Weber, captured in his notion of \\"polytheism\\".  Context  Value-pluralism is an alternative to both moral relativism and moral absolutism (which Berlin called monism). An example of value-pluralism is the idea that the moral life of a nun is incompatible with that of a mother, yet there is no purely rational measure of which is preferable. Hence, moral decisions often require radical preferences with no rational calculus to determine which alternative is to be selected. Value- pluralism differs from value-relativism in that pluralism accepts limits to differences, such as when vital human needs are violated. Political scientists have often referred to societies as being pluralistic on the basis of the existence of several competing value systems. Littunen says that such societies exhibit value pluralism. If values can be compared with virtues or duties then reference might also be made to the arguments of classical philosophy. Kant, for example, referred to \\"a conflict of duties\\"Kant I. Critique of Practical Reason 1788 (tr. Abbott T.K., Longmans, Green & Co., London, 1883) p.280 and the subject can be traced back to Plato's Statesman where he wrote that although the aim may be \\"to promote not a part of virtue but the whole\\", it is often the case that the different parts of virtue \\"may be at war with one another\\".Plato Statesman 306; cf. Laws 705, Republic 443  Adherents  Isaiah Berlin suggested that James Fitzjames Stephen, rather than himself, deserved credit for fathering value-pluralism. Stephen had observed: > \\"There are innumerable differences which obviously add to the interest of > life, and without which it would be unendurably dull. Again, there are > differences which can neither be left unsettled nor be settled without a > struggle, and a real one, but in regard to which the struggle is rather > between inconsistent forms of good than between good and evil. In cases of > this sort no one need see an occasion for anything more than a good-tempered > trial of strength and skill, except those narrow-minded fanatics whose minds > are incapable of taking in more than one idea at a time, or of having a > taste for more things than one, which one thing is generally a trifle. There > is no surer mark of a poor, contemptible, cowardly character than the > inability to conduct disputes of this sort with fairness, temper, humanity, > goodwill to antagonists, and a determination to accept a fair defeat in good > part and to make the best of it.\\" William James, influenced by Fitzjames Stephen, endorsed value-pluralism in an essay on \\"The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life\\", which he first delivered as a lecture in 1891. He wrote that none \\"of the measures [of goodness] that have been actually proposed has, however, given general satisfaction ... The various ideals have no common character apart from the fact that they are ideals. No single abstract principle can be so used as to yield to the philosopher anything like a scientifically accurate and genuinely useful casuistic scale.\\" Joseph Raz and many others have done further work clarifying and defending value-pluralism. For instance, political philosopher William Galston, former policy advisor to President Bill Clinton, has defended a Berlinian approach to value pluralism in books like Liberal Pluralism. Social psychologist Philip E. Tetlock, studies and identifies with value pluralism.  Criticisms  The philosopher Charles Blattberg, who was Berlin's student, has advanced an important critique of Berlin's value-pluralism. Blattberg focuses on value-pluralism's applications to Marx, the Russian intelligentsia, Judaism, and Berlin's early political thought, as well as Berlin's conceptions of liberty, the Enlightenment versus the Counter-Enlightenment, and history. Another notable critic of value-pluralism in recent times is Ronald Dworkin, the second most-cited American legal scholar, who attempts to forge a liberal theory of equality from a monist starting-point, citing the failure of value- pluralism to adequately address the \\"Equality of what?\\" debate. Alan Brown suggests that Berlin ignores the fact that values are indeed commensurable as they can be compared by their varying contributions towards the human good.Brown, A. (1986) Modern Political Philosophy; Theories of the Just Society, Middlesex, Penguin Books pp. 157‚Äì158 Regarding the ends of freedom, equality, efficiency, creativity, etc., Brown maintains that none of these are ends in themselves but are valued for their consequences. Brown concludes that Berlin has failed to show that the problem of conflicting values is insoluble in principle. The deliberative democrat Robert Talisse has published several articles criticizing the pluralism of Isaiah Berlin, William Galston, Richard Flathman, and John Gray, alleging informal logic and internal epistemological contradictions.

For the Americans, the treaty had the goals of making the British abandon the practice of impressing sailors from American ships , addressing the neutral trading rights of American vessels during the ongoing Napoleonic Wars, and other commercial concerns. However, the British were short of manpower for the Royal Navy and believed that many British deserters were serving on American ships. In the desperate war against Napoleon, the British believed that they could not afford to abandon impressment and that offending the Americans was seen as a much lesser evil than losing to Napoleon. Therefore, no concessions on the issue of impressment were made. The negotiations were begun on 27 August 1806, and the treaty was signed on 31 December 1806. Jefferson received the treaty in March 1807 but was disappointed and refused to submit it to the US Senate for ratification. That failure to resolve differences over the issuea of impressment and of neutral trading rights contributed to the coming of the War of 1812.

The agency's jurisdiction stretches roughly along the Delaware River, from the Philadelphia/Bucks County, PA. boundary northward to the New Jersey/New York state line. The DRJTBC currently operates eight toll bridges and 12 toll-supported (free) bridges (two of which are pedestrian-only crossings), as well as 34 approach structures throughout its jurisdiction. Revenues from the eight toll bridges subsidize the other bridges. Since 1987, the commission has not received any state or federal tax revenues and relies solely on toll collections for its financing. In 2019, more than 138 million cars and trucks used the DRJTBC's network of Delaware River bridge crossings.  History  The DRJTBC was established under legislation enacted in the two states on December 18, 1934. The federal compact for the DRJTBC was first approved by Congress in 1935. The compact has been modified several times (on July 8, 1947, July 17, 1951, July 16, 1953, and March 19, 1986). In 1984 and 1985, the states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey entered into the current version of the interstate compact, known as the \\"1984 agreement.\\" This change was substantial as it meant that the DRJTBC no longer would receive tax dollars to maintain the commissions toll-supported bridges, known as tax-supported bridges until the 1984 agreement. This meant that the commission assumed full financial responsibility for their toll-free bridges. Later revisions also made it so that the DRJTBC could build the Interstate 78 Bridge over the Delaware River and operate it as a tolled crossing.  Board Of Commissioners  A board of 10 unpaid commissioners govern the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, with five coming from each state. In New Jersey, members are nominated by the New Jersey Governor and confirmed by the State Senate for three-year terms, while in Pennsylvania, five members are appointed by the Pennsylvania Governor and serve at his pleasure. They meet monthly to review reports, provide oversight and set policies carried out by the Executive Director and professional staff.  Tolling  The Commission charges a $1.00 cash auto toll (60 cents for frequent E-ZPass commuter users) on seven out of the eight toll bridges, as of July 1, 2011. Truck tolls range from $5.85 to $28.00, depending on axle type, time of travel and whether E-ZPass is used. Tolls are collected only from traffic crossing into Pennsylvania. As of July 14, 2019, an all-electronic toll is charged on the Scudder Falls Bridge, which is undergoing a replacement project. The Commission is a member of the Interagency Group, a regional collaborative of toll-collection agencies that offer E-ZPass electronic toll collection services. In November 2013, The Commission voted to merge E-ZPass operations with the New Jersey E-ZPass Customer Service Center as a cost- cutting measure. Previously, the Commission had been the last agency in the Delaware Valley to implement a monthly service fee.

For some years he taught at the knight academy in Dresden, and won a high reputation by his lectures on the history of philosophy in Germany. In 1839 he became professor in Kiel University, where, with the exception of one brief interval, when he was expelled with several colleagues because of his German sympathies, he remained till his death. His first published work, Historische Entwicklung der spekulativen Philosophie von Kant bis Hegel (1837, 5th ed. 1860), which still ranks among the best expositions of modern German thought, has been twice translated into English, by Alfred Tulk (London, 1854), and by Alfred Edersheim (Edinburgh, 1854). His chief works are Entwurf eines Systems der Wissenschaftslehre (Kiel, 1846) and System der spekulativen Ethik (2 vols., 1850). He opposed both the extreme realism of Herbart and what he regarded as the one-sided idealism of Hegel, and endeavoured to find a mean between them, to discover the ideal or formal principle which unfolds itself in the real or material world presented to it. His Wissenschaftslehre, accordingly, divides itself into #Principlehre, or theory of the one principle; #Vermittelungslehre, or theory of the means by which this principle realizes itself; and #Teleologie. The most noticeable point is the position assigned by Chalyb√§us to the World Ether, which is defined as the infinite in time and space, and which, he thinks, must be posited as necessarily coexisting with the Infinite Spirit or God. The fundamental principle of the System der Ethik is carried out with great strength of thought, and with an unusually complete command of ethical material.

He was a member of the Ontario Liberal Party. Career Sopha was born in Cobalt, Ontario. He served with the Royal Canadian Navy and attended the University of Toronto, receiving a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1953. Sopha was called to the bar two years later, and was named a Queen's Counsel in 1965. He was first elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1959 provincial election, defeating his Progressive Conservative opponent by 3,143 votes. He was re-elected with a reduced majority in the 1963 election, and defeated Progressive Conservative Jim Gordon by only 540 votes in 1967. Nicknamed \\"The Northern Gadfly\\" by the southern Ontario media, Sopha was considered one of the great orators in Ontario politics of his era. He was one of just two MPPs in the province, with caucus colleague Leo Troy, who voted against the adoption of the current Flag of Ontario. The Sudbury area has a large population of Franco-Ontarians among whom the flag was widely regarded as a symbol of British imperialism, and Sopha argued in the legislature that the flag was not an appropriate symbol of Ontario's cultural diversity.\\"2 Liberals Only MPPs To Vote Against Ensign\\". The Globe and Mail, March 17, 1965. Also in 1965, Sopha spoke out in the legislature against CBC news anchor Earl Cameron, for allegedly having compromised his objectivity by appearing in a toothpaste commercial. Sopha strongly opposed Charles Templeton's bid for the Liberal Party leadership in 1966, following the resignation of Andy Thompson. He had been one of Templeton's strongest supporters in the 1964 Liberal leadership race and the only caucus member to have supported the broadcaster, but Sopha announced that his previous support of Templeton had been a serious mistake. It has been suggested that Sopha raised money for Templeton in 1964, which Templeton never acknowledged.Jonathan Manthorpe, The Power and the Tories, p. 168. Templeton declined to enter the contest, largely due to opposition from the party caucus. Sopha did not seek re-election in the 1971 campaign, and served on the governing body of the Law Society of Upper Canada from 1971 to 1975. He attempted a return to the legislature in the 1975 election, and lost to New Democratic Party (NDP) candidate Bud Germa by 2,278 votes. He tried again in the 1981 election, and lost to NDP candidate Floyd Laughren by 3,410 votes in Nickel Belt. Sopha died suddenly while vacationing in Phoenix, Arizona on January 4, 1982. He was survived by his wife, a son, and three daughters.

In addition to performing the traditional music of Mali, he has also been involved in cross- cultural collaborations with flamenco, blues, jazz, and other international styles. Biography Diabat√© comes from a long family tradition of kora players, including his father Sidiki Diabat√©, who recorded the first ever kora album in 1970. His family's oral tradition tells of 70 generations of musicians preceding him in a patrilineal line. His cousin Sona Jobarteh is the first female kora player to come from a Griot family. His younger brother Mamadou Sidiki Diabat√© is also a prominent kora player. In 1987, Diabate made an appearance, on Ba Togoma, an album featuring his father's ensemble. This was his opportunity to be heard outside his homeland. In 1988, he released his first album in the West, a solo endeavour entitled Kaira, recorded in one afternoon in London and produced by Lucy Dur√°n. In addition to performing Malian traditional music, Diabat√© has also performed and recorded in cross- cultural settings. He has collaborated with flamenco group Ketama, forming a combined group known as Songhai and releasing two recordings: Songhai I and Songhai II. In 1999, Diabat√© collaborated with American blues musician Taj Mahal on the release Kulanjan. MALIcool is a collaboration with American jazz trombonist Roswell Rudd. He also collaborated with the Icelandic popular musician Bj√∂rk on her 2007 album Volta. In 1999, Diabat√© released the album New Ancient Strings, a collaboration with Ballak√© Sissoko. In September 2005, he released In the Heart of the Moon, for which he collaborated with Ali Farka Tour√©. The album went on to win the 2006 Grammy Award for Best Traditional World Music Album. On 25 July 2006, he released Boulevard de l'Ind√©pendance, recorded with his Symmetric Orchestra. In the Heart of the Moon and Boulevard de l'Ind√©pendance, are both part of the Hotel Mand√© Sessions, recorded by Nick Gold and released on World Circuit Records. Both Boulevard and Hotel Mand√© are references to landmarks in Mali's capital city, Bamako. The Symmetric Orchestra, led by Diabat√©, is composed of musicians (mostly griots) from across the old Mande Empire of West Africa, who play a mix of traditional instruments including the kora, djembe, balafon, and bolombatto, as well as modern ones like the guitar and electronic keyboard. Diabat√© appeared in 2006 at the WOMAD Festival UK, Roskilde Festival in Denmark, and at the Sziget Festival in Budapest, Hungary. In 2007, he performed at the Glastonbury Festival and toured the U.S.A. In 2008, he was at WOMADelaide in Adelaide, Australia.WOMADelaide, site accessed 11 March 2008 In early 2008, Diabat√© released a new album of solo kora music, The Mand√© Variations, to widespread critical acclaim. Many reviewers praised the project for its detailed recording of the K kora and careful mastering, in addition to the improvisational skills and wide range of apparent influences on display. In October 2008, the Arabic-language lyrics in Diabat√©'s song \\"Tapha Niang\\" (from Boulevard de l'Ind√©pendance) were removed from the PlayStation 3 video game LittleBigPlanet, after it elicited objections from a Muslim individual due to their inclusion of verses from the Qur‚Äôan. The publisher, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, decided to delay the launch of the game by a week and recall most discs in order to replace the song with a lyric-free instrumental version. However, some copies of the original game had already been sold in the Middle East and United States. Diabat√© was chosen by Matt Groening to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in May 2010 in Minehead. Diabat√© also performed at Hay Festival in June. In July, he performed at the Larmer Tree Festival to huge acclaim. In February 2016, Diabat√© hosted Festival Acoustik Bamako, a three-day music festival to bring together international and Malian musicians along with other public figures with an overall message of peace. It was planned as a collection of outdoor and indoor music events to draw crowds of more than 20,000 people.

Life Thomas Chaloner was born in 1521 to Margaret Myddleton and Roger Challoner (c. 1490‚Äì1550), a descendant of the Denbighshire Chaloners. His father was a London silk merchant who lived at St Mary-at-Hill Street, Billingsgate. A courtier, Roger was a Gentleman-Usher of the Privy Chamber to King Henry VIII, a Teller of the Receipt of the Exchequer, and a Freeman of the City of London through the Worshipful Company of Mercers.Arthur Went, The Galway fishery, in 'Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy: Section C', Volume 48, p. 242George Farnham, Quordon records (1912), p. 213 Roger died in 1550 and was buried in the main body of the Church of St Dunstan-in-the-East. Sir Thomas's two brothers, Francis and John Challoner settled in Ireland where John became a prominent politician and administrator.Ball Wright, The Ussher memoirs, pp. 105‚Äì107 No details are known of Thomas Chaloner's youth except that he was educated at both Oxford and Cambridge (likely St John's College).He may have attended St John's College, Cambridge. In 1540 he went, as secretary to Sir Henry Knyvett, to the court of Charles V, whom he accompanied in his expedition against Algiers in 1541, and was wrecked on the Barbary coast. In 1547 he joined in the expedition to Scotland, and was knighted, after the battle of Pinkie near Musselburgh, by the protector Somerset, whose patronage he enjoyed. In 1549 he was a witness against Edmund Bonner, bishop of London; in 1551 against Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester; in the spring of the latter year he was sent as a commissioner to Scotland to conclude the Treaty of Norham, and again in March 1552. In 1553 he went with Sir Nicholas Wotton and Sir William Pickering on an embassy to France, but was recalled by Queen Mary on her accession. In spite of his Protestant views, Chaloner was still employed by the government, going to Scotland in 1555‚Äì1556, and providing carriages for troops in the war with France, 1557‚Äì1558. In 1558 he went as Elizabeth's ambassador to the Emperor Ferdinand at Cambrai, from July 1559 to February 1559/60 he was ambassador to Philip II of Spain at Brussels, and in 1561 he went in the same capacity to Spain. His letters are full of complaints of his treatment there, but it was not till 1564, when in failing health, that he was allowed to return home. He died at his house in Clerkenwell on 14 October 1565. Woodcut portrait of Sir Thomas Chaloner, frontispiece to his 1579 De Rep. Anglorum instauranda libri decem. He acquired during his years of service three estates, Guisborough in Yorkshire, Steeple Claydon in Buckinghamshire, and St Bees in Cumberland. He married (I) Joan, widow of Sir Thomas Leigh; and (2) Audrey, daughter of Edward Frodsham, of Elton, Cheshire, by whom he had one son, Sir Thomas Chaloner (1559‚Äì1615). Chaloner was the intimate of most of the learned men of his day, and with Lord Burghley he had a lifelong friendship. Throughout his busy official life he occupied himself with literature, his Latin verses and his pastoral poems being much admired by his contemporaries. Chaloner's \\" Howe the Lorde Mowbray . . was .. . banyshed the Realme,\\" printed in the 1559 edition of William Baldwin's Mirror for Magistrates (repr. in vol. ii. pt. 1 of Joseph Haslewood's edition of 1815), has sometimes been attributed to Thomas Churchyard. His most important work, De Rep. Anglorum instauranda libri decem, written while he was in Spain, was first published by William Malim (1579, 3 pts.), with complimentary Latin verses in praise of the author by Burghley and others. Chaloner's epigrams and epitaphs were also added to the volume, as well as in laudem Henrici octavi . . . carmen Panegericum, first printed in 1560. Amongst his other works are The praise of folie, Moriae encomium . . . by Erasmus ... Englished by Sir Thomas Chaloner, Knight (1549, ed. Janet E. Ashbee, 1901); A book of the Office of Servantes (1543), translated from Gilbert Cousin (Gilbertus Cognatus); and An homilie of Saint John Chrysostome ... Englished by T. C. (1544). See \\"The Chaloners, Lords of the Manor of St Bees,\\" by William Jackson, in Transactions of the Cumberland Assoc. for the Advancement of Literature and Science, pt. vi. pp. 47‚Äì74, 1880‚Äì1881. In 1598 Chaloner is mentioned in Francis Meres' Palladis Tamia as a pastoral poet: 'As Theocritus in Greeke, Virgil and Mantuan in Latine, Sanazar in Italian, and the Authour of Amyntae Gaudia and Walsinghams Melibaeus are the best for pastorall: so amongst us the best in this kind are Sir Philip Sidney, master Challener, Spencer, Stephen Gosson, Abraham Fraunce and Barnefield.' Palladis Tamia is important in English literary history as the first critical account of the poems and early plays of William Shakespeare.

Exophora can be deictic, in which special words or grammatical markings are used to make reference to something in the context of the utterance or speaker. For example, pronouns are often exophoric, with words such as \\"this\\", \\"that\\", \\"here\\", \\"there\\", as in that chair over there is John's said while indicating the direction of the chair referred to. Given \\"Did the gardener water those plants?\\", it is quite possible that \\"those\\" refers back to the preceding text, to some earlier mention of those particular plants in the discussion. But it is also possible that it refers to the environment in which the dialogue is taking place--to the \\"context of situation\\", as it is called--where the plants in question are present and can be pointed to if necessary. The interpretation would be \\"those plants there, in front of us\\". This kind of reference is called exophora, since it takes us outside the text altogether. Exophoric reference is not cohesive, since it does not bind the two elements together into a text. Homophora A type of exophora, homophora relates to a generic phrase that obtains a specific meaning through knowledge of its context; a specific example of homophora can variably be a \\"homophor\\" or a \\"homophoric reference\\". For example, the meaning of the phrase \\"the Queen\\" may be determined by the country in which it is spoken. Because there are many Queens throughout the world, the location of the speaker provides the extra information that allows an individual Queen to be identified. The precise origin of the term is not fully clear, but it is probably intended to suggest a referring expression that always has the same (Greek h√≥mos) referent (within a given cultural context, of course). \\"Homophoric\\" seems to have been first used in the influential book by M.A.K. Halliday and R. Hasan, Cohesion in English (Longman, 1976, pp. 71 and 73).

Coreference is the main concept underlying binding phenomena in the field of syntax. The theory of binding explores the syntactic relationship that exists between coreferential expressions in sentences and texts. When two expressions are coreferential, the one is usually a full form (the antecedent) and the other is an abbreviated form (a proform or anaphor). Linguists use indices to show coreference, as with the i index in the example Billi said hei would come. The two expressions with the same reference are coindexed, hence in this example Bill and he are coindexed, indicating that they should be interpreted as coreferential. Types When exploring coreference, there are numerous distinctions that can be made, e.g. anaphora, cataphora, split antecedents, coreferring noun phrases, etc.These distinctions (anaphora, cataphora, split antecedents, coreferring noun phrases, etc.) are discussed in Jurafsky and Martin (2000:669ff.). When dealing with proforms (pronouns, pro-verbs, pro- adjectives, etc.), one distinguishes between anaphora and cataphora. When the proform follows the expression to which it refers, anaphora is present (the proform is an anaphor), and when it precedes the expression to which it refers, cataphora is present (the proform is a cataphor). These notions are illustrated as follows: :: _Anaphora_ ::a. The musici was so loud that iti couldn't be enjoyed. ‚ÄìThe anaphor it follows the expression to which it refers (its antecedent). ::b. Our neighborsi dislike the music. If theyi are angry, the cops will show up soon. ‚Äì The anaphor they follows the expression to which it refers (its antecedent). :: _Cataphora_ ::a. If theyi are angry about the music, the neighborsi will call the cops. ‚Äì The cataphor they precedes the expression to which it refers (its postcedent). ::b. Despite heri difficulty, Wilmai came to understand the point. ‚Äì The cataphor her precedes the expression to which it refers (its postcedent) :: _Split antecedents_ ::a. Caroli told Bobi to attend the party. Theyi arrived together. ‚Äì The anaphor they has a split antecedent, referring to both Carol and Bob. ::b. When Caroli helps Bobi and Bobi helps Caroli, theyi can accomplish any task. ‚Äì The anaphor they has a split antecedent, referring to both Carol and Bob. :: _Coreferring noun phrases_ ::a. The project leaderi is refusing to help. The jerki thinks only of himself. ‚Äì Coreferring noun phrases, whereby the second noun phrase is a predication over the first. ::b. Some of our colleagues1 are going to be supportive. These kinds of people1 will earn our gratitude. ‚Äì Coreferring noun phrases, whereby the second noun phrase is a predication over the first. Versus bound variables Semanticists and logicians sometimes draw a distinction between coreference and what is known as a bound variable.For discussions of bound variables, see for instance Portner (2005:102ff.). An instance of a bound variable can look like coreference, but from a technical standpoint, one can argue that it actually is not. Bound variables occur when the antecedent to the proform is an indefinite quantified expression, e.g.See Jurafsky and Martin (2000:701) for an example of a bound variable like the ones given here. ::a. Every studenti has received hisi grade. ‚Äì The pronoun his is an example of a bound variable ::b. No studenti was upset with hisi grade. ‚Äì The pronoun his is an example of a bound variable Quantified expressions such as every student and no student are, from a technical standpoint, not referential. The subjects every student and no student are grammatically singular, but they do not pick out single referents in the discourse world. Thus since the antecedents to the possessive adjective his is not referential, one also cannot say that his is referential. Instead, one says it is a variable that is bound by its antecedent. Its reference varies based upon which of the students in the discourse world is thought of. If Jack, John, and Jerry are the three students in the discourse world, then the meaning of his varies based upon whether Jack, John, or Jerry is the focus of the minds eye. The existence of bound variables is perhaps more apparent with the following example: ::c. Only Jacki likes hisi grade. ‚Äì The pronoun his can be a bound variable. This sentence is ambiguous. It can mean that Jack likes his grade, but everyone else dislikes Jack's grade, or more likely, it means that Jack likes his grade, but John dislikes his (John's) grade, and Jerry dislikes his (Jerry's) grade. The second, more natural reading is the bound variable reading. While the distinction between coreference and bound variables may be real, coindexation can be construed as accommodating both. That is, when two or more expressions are coindexed, it indicates that one is dealing with coreference or a bound variable.  Coreference resolution  In computational linguistics, coreference resolution is a well-studied problem in discourse. To derive the correct interpretation of a text, or even to estimate the relative importance of various mentioned subjects, pronouns and other referring expressions must be connected to the right individuals. Algorithms intended to resolve coreferences commonly look first for the nearest preceding individual that is compatible with the referring expression. For example, she might attach to a preceding expression such as the woman or Anne, but not to Bill. Pronouns such as himself have much stricter constraints. As with many linguistic tasks, there is a tradeoff between precision and recall, the calculation of which can vary as no single algorithm exists to measure the quality of coreference chains. Cluster quality metrics commonly used to evaluate coreference resolution algorithms are Rand index, adjusted Rand index or different mutual information-based methods. A classic problem for coreference resolution in English is the pronoun it, which has many uses. It can refer much like he and she, except that it generally refers to inanimate objects (the rules are actually more complex: animals may be any of it, he, or she; ships are traditionally she; hurricanes are usually it despite having gendered names). It can also refer to abstractions rather than beings, e.g. He was paid minimum wage, but didn't seem to mind it. Finally, it also has pleonastic uses, which do not refer to anything specific: :: a. It's raining. :: b. It's really a shame. :: c. It takes a lot of work to succeed. :: d. Sometimes it's the loudest who have the most influence. Pleonastic uses are not considered referential, and so are not part of coreference.Li et al. (2009) have demonstrated high accuracy in sorting out pleonastic it, and this success promises to improve the accuracy of coreference resolution overall. Approaches to coreference resolution can broadly be separated into mention- pair, mention-ranking or entity-based algorithms. Mention-pair algorithms involve binary decisions if a pair of two given mentions belong to the same entity. Entity-wide constraints like gender are not considered, which leads to error propagation. For example the pronouns he or she can both have a high probability of coreference with the teacher, but cannot be coreferent with each other. Mention-ranking algorithms expand on this idea but instead stipulate that one mention can only be coreferent with one (previous) mention. As a result, each previous mention must be given assigned a score and the highest scoring mention (or no mention) is linked. Finally, in entity-based methods mentions are linked based on information of the whole coreference chain instead of individual mentions. The representation of a variable-width chain is more complex and computationally expensive than mention-based methods, which lead to these algorithms being mostly based on neural network architectures.

For example, in the sentences \\"I saw Sally yesterday. She was lying on the beach\\", \\"she\\" is an endophoric expression because it refers to something mentioned elsewhere in the text, i.e. \\"Sally\\". By contrast, \\"She was lying on the beach,\\" if it appeared by itself, contains an exophoric expression; \\"she\\" refers to something that is not present in the surrounding text, so there is not enough information given within the text to independently determine to whom \\"she\\" refers. It can refer to someone the speaker assumes his audience has prior knowledge of, or it can refer to a person he is showing to his listeners. Without further information, in other words, there is no way of knowing the exact meaning of an exophoric term.

He was nicknamed The Angus Rembrandt. He started painting portraits including those of many artists such as Jozef Isra√´ls (1824-1911) \\"the most respected Dutch artist of the second half of the nineteenth century\\", which was painted together with Hugh Cameron, the portrait painters William McTaggart (1835-1911) and John Pettie (1839-1893) the paintings of the later two artists are in the collection of the National Galleries of Scotland. He also painted the interiors of houses and cottages like the Cranbrook Colony painters and some Dutch painters but he turned to landscapes and seascapes later in his career. The best of these are The End of the Harvest (1873), Running Water (1875), and The Legend (National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh). He became an associate (1867) and a full member (1871) of the Royal Scottish Academy. His life was cut short in 1878 when he was violently mugged just off Charlotte Square in Edinburgh and died as a result of his injuries. He died firmly established as one of the most important Scottish artists of his period. He and his work were celebrated in a sizeable volume written and edited by Edward Pinnington. This volume was produced in collaboration with his patron, George B. Simpson. Copies of Chalmers' correspondence with Simpson from 1864 to 1873 are held in the Royal Scottish Academy's George B.

It is an example of liquid‚Äìliquid extraction. The process takes advantage of two liquid-state properties of zinc. The first is that zinc is immiscible with lead, and the other is that silver is 3000 times more soluble in zinc than it is in lead. When zinc is added to liquid lead that contains silver as a contaminant, the silver preferentially migrates into the zinc. Because the zinc is immiscible in the lead it remains in a separate layer and is easily removed. The zinc- silver solution is then heated until the zinc vaporizes, leaving nearly pure silver. If gold is present in the liquid lead, it can also be removed and isolated by the same process.Pauling, Linus General Chemistry W.H.Freeman 1947 ed. The process was patented by Alexander Parkes in 1850. Parkes received two additional patents in 1852. The Parkes process was not adopted in the United States, due to the low native production of lead. The problems were overcome during the 1880s and by 1923 only when the Parkes process was used.

Biography  Pearl was born in Prineville, Oregon. His first major victory was in the 1953 Amateur Mr Universe contest, in which he beat out a then 23-year-old Sean Connery. He actively competed until his retirement in 1971, when he won the Mr. Universe title one last time, beating Frank Zane, Reg Park and Sergio Oliva. In all, he won the professional Mr Universe 4 times in an 18-year span, which was unprecedented at the time. He was the first professional bodybuilder to author bodybuilding training courses and booklets. He is also the first to pose to music, and was especially noted in performing exhibitions doing an entire posing routine of Eugen Sandow (who is known as the man who invented bodybuilding). Ever the showman, Pearl would wear a fake mustache, leotards, a fig leaf, and a late-19th century backdrop, all for providing the exact effect of the Sandow era. Pearl was equally as famous for performing his strongman routine, which included tearing of license plates, bending penny spike nails, and blowing up a hot water bottle as well as his ability on the bench press exercise using up to 500 lbs. He is the author of the popular exercise book, Getting Stronger: Weight Training for Men and Women, which has sold over 350,000 copies in the United States and has been translated into four other languages, including Chinese. His book, Keys To The INNER Universe, is to this day considered a \\"must read\\" for bodybuilders. It contains 1,500 weight- training exercises, weighs five pounds, and has sold over 60,000 copies. Pearl had his own monthly question-and-answer column called \\"Pearl of the Universe\\" in the bodybuilding magazine MuscleMag International as well as one in Muscle Builder (later Muscle & Fitness) magazine, titled \\"Wisdom of Pearl\\" in the 1970s and 1980s. In 2003 with co-author Kim Shott, Pearl published his autobiography, Beyond the Universe: The Bill Pearl Story. During the 1980s, Pearl served as a mentor, trainer, and training partner to many of the top professionals that were still competing. One such individual was Mr. Olympia, Chris Dickerson. In 2004, Pearl was awarded the Arnold Schwarzenegger Classic Lifetime Achievement Award for significantly impacting the world of bodybuilding.

Vito is originally portrayed by Marlon Brando in the 1972 film The Godfather and later by Oreste Baldini as a boy and by Robert De Niro as a young man in The Godfather Part II (1974). He is an orphaned Sicilian immigrant who builds a Mafia empire. He and his wife Carmela have four children: Santino (\\"Sonny\\"), Frederico (\\"Fredo\\"), and Michael, and one daughter Constanzia (\\"Connie\\"). Vito informally adopts Sonny's friend, Tom Hagen, who becomes his lawyer and consigliere. Upon Vito's death, Michael succeeds him as Don of the Corleone crime family. Vito oversees a business founded on gambling, bootlegging, prostitution, and union corruption, but he is known as a kind, generous man who lives by a strict moral code of loyalty to friends and, above all, family. He is also known as a traditionalist who demands respect commensurate with his status; even his closest friends refer to him as \\"Godfather\\" or \\"Don Corleone\\" rather than \\"Vito\\".  Early years  Vito Andolini's story begins in Corleone, Sicily. He was born on December 7, 1891. In 1901, the local mafia chieftain, Don Ciccio, murders Vito's father Antonio when he refuses to pay him tribute. Paolo, Vito's older brother, swears revenge, but Ciccio's men kill him too. Vito's mother begs Ciccio to spare Vito, but Ciccio refuses, reasoning the boy will seek revenge as a grown man. Upon Ciccio's refusal, Vito's mother holds a knife to Ciccio's throat, allowing her son to escape while Ciccio's men kill her. Family friends smuggle Vito out of Sicily, putting him on a ship with immigrants traveling to America. Ellis Island immigration officials rename him Vito Corleone, using his village for his surname. He later uses Andolini as his middle name in acknowledgement of his family heritage. Vito is taken in by the Abbandando family, who are distant relations of his, in Little Italy on New York's Lower East Side. Vito grows very close to the Abbandandos, particularly their son, Genco, who is like a brother to him. Vito earns an honest living at the Abbandandos' grocery store, but the elder Abbandando is forced to fire him when Don Fanucci, a blackhander and the local neighborhood padrone, demands that the grocery hire his nephew. A young Vito (played by Robert De Niro) kills Don Fanucci In 1920, Vito is befriended by Peter Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio, who teach him how to survive by fencing stolen dresses and performing favors in return for loyalty. Fanucci learns of Vito's operation and demands a cut of his illegal profits or he will report Vito and his partners to the police. Vito then devises a plan to kill Fanucci. During the festival of Saint Rocco, Vito trails Fanucci from Little Italy's rooftops, jumping from one building to the next, as Fanucci walks home. Vito enters Fanucci's building and shoots him in the chest, face and throat, killing him. Vito then takes over the neighborhood, treating it with far greater respect than Fanucci did. Vito and Genco start an olive oil importing business, Genco Pura Olive Oil Company. It eventually becomes the nation's largest olive oil importing company, and the main legal front for Vito's growing organized crime syndicate. Between Genco Pura and his illegal operations, Vito becomes a wealthy man. In 1923, he returns to Sicily for the first time since fleeing as a child. He and his partner Don Tommasino systematically eliminate Don Ciccio's men who were involved in murdering Vito's family and arrange a meeting with Ciccio himself. Vito carves open the elderly Don's stomach, thus avenging his family. Tommasino takes over the town and is the family's staunchest ally in the old country for the next half century. By the early 1930s, Vito has organized his criminal operations as the Corleone crime family, one of the most powerful in the nation. Genco Abbandando is his consigliere, and Clemenza and Tessio are caporegimes. As a boy, Vito's oldest son, Sonny, brings his homeless friend, Tom Hagen, to stay with the Corleones and Vito unofficially adopts him. As an adult, Sonny becomes a capo, Vito's heir apparent and de facto underboss. Fredo, Vito's second-born son, is deemed too weak and unintelligent to handle important family business and takes on only minor responsibilities. Vito has a difficult relationship with his youngest son, Michael, who wants nothing to do with the family business. Michael enlists to fight in World War II against Vito's wishes; when Michael is wounded in combat, Vito pulls strings to have him honorably discharged and sent back to the U.S., without Michael's knowledge. Around 1939, Vito moves his home and base of operations to Long Beach, New York on Long Island, where Genco serves as Vito's most trusted adviser until he is stricken with cancer and can no longer fulfill his duties. Hagen, who by now has become a practicing attorney, takes Genco's place. Vito prides himself on being careful and reasonable, but does not completely forsake violence. When his godson, singer Johnny Fontane, wants to be released from his contract with a bandleader, Vito offers to buy him out, but the bandleader refuses. Vito then makes the bandleader an \\"offer he can't refuse\\": he threatens to kill him unless he releases Fontane for a much smaller sum. Later, when movie mogul Jack Woltz refuses to cast Fontane in a film role that could rejuvenate his waning career, Vito's men kill Woltz's champion racehorse and place the severed head in Woltz's bed as he sleeps as a final warning. The Godfather In 1945, heroin kingpin Virgil Sollozzo asks Vito to invest in his operation. Sollozzo is backed by the rival Tattaglia family, and wants Vito's political influence and legal protection. Vito declines, believing the politicians and judges on his payroll would turn against him if he engaged in drug trafficking. During the meeting, Sonny expresses interest in the deal. After the meeting, Vito castigates his son for letting an outsider know what he was thinking. During Christmas, as Vito crosses a street to buy oranges from a fruit stand, Sollozzo's hitmen emerge with guns drawn. Vito runs for his Cadillac, but is shot five times. Fredo, who had been accompanying Vito, drops his gun and is unable to return fire as the assassins escape. (The murder of Frank Scalice inspired the assassination attempt on Vito.) Vito survives, and Sollozzo makes a second assassination attempt at the hospital. Mark McCluskey‚Äîa corrupt police captain on Sollozzo's payroll‚Äîhas removed Vito's bodyguards, leaving him unprotected. However, Michael arrives moments before the imminent attack. Realizing his father is in danger, Michael has Vito moved to another room, and affirms his loyalty at Vito's bedside. While Vito recovers, Sonny serves as acting head of the family. Michael, knowing his father will never be safe while Sollozzo lives, convinces Sonny that he can murder Sollozzo and McCluskey. Michael lures both men to a meeting at a restaurant in The Bronx, retrieves a handgun planted by Clemenza in the bathroom, and shoots both men dead. Michael is then smuggled to Sicily under the protection of Vito's friend and business partner Don Tommasino. The deaths of Sollozzo and McCluskey ignite a war between the Corleone and Tattaglia families, with the other New York families backing the latter. After Sonny is killed by Barzini's men, Vito resumes control and brokers a peace accord among the families, during which he realizes that Barzini masterminded the attempt on his life and Sonny's murder. Michael returns home to become Vito's heir apparent. Michael marries his girlfriend Kay Adams, and Vito semi-retires, making Michael the operating head of the family‚Äîsomething Vito had never wanted for his favorite son. Vito becomes his informal consigliere, replacing Hagen. Michael persuades Vito that it is time to remove the family from the Mafia. At the same time, Michael and Vito secretly plan to eliminate the other New York dons, while allowing them to whittle away at Corleone family interests to lull them into inaction. Vito warns Michael that Barzini will set Michael up to be killed under the guise of a meeting; Barzini will use one of the Corleone Family's most trusted members as an intermediary. Shortly afterwards, on July 29, 1955, Vito dies of a heart attack in his garden while playing with his grandson, Michael's son Anthony. In the novel, his last words are, \\"Life is so beautiful.\\" At Vito's funeral, Tessio inadvertently reveals that he is the traitor when he tells Michael that Barzini wants a meeting and that he can set it up on his territory in Brooklyn, where Michael would be safe. Days later, Michael eliminates the other New York dons in a wave of assassinations. Tessio and Connie's abusive husband, Carlo Rizzi, are also murdered for conspiring with Barzini. In one stroke, the Corleone family regains its status as the most powerful criminal organization in the country.  Sequel novels  Vito appears in both The Godfather Returns, Mark Winegardner's 2004 sequel to Puzo's novel and The Family Corleone, a 2012 novel by Ed Falco. These novels explore his rise to power in the 1920s and 1930s and his early relationships with his wife and children.

He was portrayed as a boy by Oreste Baldini and as a younger man in The Godfather Part II by Robert De Niro. Both performances won Academy Awards ‚Äî Best Actor for Brando, Best Supporting Actor for De Niro. Vito Corleone is one of only two characters played by two actors to be awarded an Oscar for both portrayals (the other being the Joker). Brando declined his Oscar, having Sacheen Littlefeather state his reasons during the awards show. Premiere Magazine listed Vito Corleone as the greatest film character in history. He was also selected as the 53rd greatest film character by Empire. Vito Corleone is based on a composite of mid-20th century New York Mafia figures Carlo Gambino, Frank Costello, Joe Bonanno, and Joe Profaci. Star Wars character Marlo the Hutt was inspired by Marlon Brando's portray of Vito Corleone, appearing among the Hutt Council in Star Wars: The Clone Wars.

Description Languages of the Indo-European family (and many others) typically have two or three of the following voices: active, middle, and passive. \\"Mediopassive\\" may be used to describe a category that covers both the middle (or \\"medium\\") and the passive voice. In synchronic grammars, the mediopassive voice is often simply termed either \\"middle\\" (typical for grammars of e.g. Ancient and Modern Greek) or \\"passive\\" (typical for grammars of e.g. modern Danish). In the oldest Indo- European languages, the distinction active/middle was the most important, whereas the development in later languages has generally been to replace the old distinction with (or to reinterpret it as) an active/passive distinction (e.g. modern English: to tease / to be teased). The Proto-Indo-European language itself is typically reconstructed as having two voices, active and mediopassive, where the middle-voice element in the mediopassive voice was dominant. Ancient Greek also had a mediopassive in the present, imperfect, perfect, and pluperfect tenses, but in the aorist and future tenses the mediopassive voice was replaced by two voices, one middle and one passive. Modern Greek and Albanian have only mediopassive in all tenses. A number of Indo-European languages have developed a new middle or mediopassive voice. Often this derives from a periphrastic form involving the active verb combined with a reflexive pronoun. This development happened independently in the Romance languages, the Slavic languages, and the North Germanic (Scandinavian) languages. North Germanic languages, and to some extent the Slavic languages, have fused the reflexive with the verb to form a new synthetic conjugation, whereas in the Romance languages the reflexive mostly remains separate. Usage The mediopassive can have many meanings depending on the context of the sentence. # Reflexive mediopassive. In Proto-Indo-European and the languages that descend from it, verbs that also had an active form could use the mediopassive in a reflexive sense, e.g. \\"I wash (myself)\\". This reflexive sense could also carry a sense of benefaction for the subject, as in the sentence \\"I sacrificed a goat (for my own benefit).\\" These constructions would have used the active form of \\"sacrificed\\" when the action was performed for some reason other than the subject's benefit. # Reciprocal mediopassive. The mediopassive can also be used in a reciprocal sense, e.g. \\"to fight\\" (with active) vs. \\"to fight each other\\" (with mediopassive). # Autocausative mediopassive describes situations where the subject causes itself to change state. # In stative verbs. Some languages always used the mediopassive with verbs relating to standing, sitting, reclining, being afraid, being ashamed, and being pleased, which did not have an active form. # Intensive mediopassive. Classical Greek also used the mediopassive in an intensive sense, e.g. \\"to be a citizen\\" (with active) vs. \\"to do the duties of being a citizen\\" (with middle). # In deponent verbs. Greek and Sanskrit both had the verb \\"to follow\\" in the mediopassive only. Latin had the form sequitur (\\"He follows\\". -tur is the mediopassive present 3rd person singular from PIE *-tor) with the same usage. In all three languages the word \\"to follow\\" came from the same Proto-Indo-European root. # The mediopassive was combined with the subjunctive to form the future tense of the verb \\"to be\\" in Classical Greek. # The mediopassive can also be used as a passive form, especially when the mediopassive endings are combined with a specialized passive verb. This was very common in Sanskrit. ExamplesEnglish= A few examples of unaccusative verbs in English with meanings similar to a mediopassive: * The book reads well. * The trousers wash easily. * Ripe oranges peel well. * The book was not selling. =Spanish= Spanish is an example of a modern language with a mediopassive voice, normally indicated by the use of a reflexive pronoun. This can variously have a middle-voice meaning (subject acting onto itself, or for its own benefit) or a passive-voice meaning (something acts onto the subject). An example sentence is ' The English translation is \\"The father became angry upon seeing his son break the lamp.\\" The verb ' is said to be mediopassive because it comprises the reflexive pronoun ' and the simple verb ', which together literally mean \\"angered himself.\\" This would be literally translated \\"The father angered himself upon seeing his son break the lamp.\\" Pragmatics quickly rejects the middle-voice meaning for the intended mediopassive-voice meaning, translated above as \\"got angry,\\" because the middle-voice is rarely used. Many intransitive Spanish verbs behave that way: ', I fell; ', I became tired. =Croatian= Croatian and other Slavic languages are very similar in this respect to Spanish, employing the same constructs with the passive/reflexive particle ': '. This would be again literally translated \\"The father angered himself when his son broke the lamp.\\" Similar constructs are ' \\"The lamp broke\\" and ' \\"The door closed.\\" However, not all verbs permit such use. The (medio)passive is used when one is unable or does not want to express the actor: ' \\"The glass broke\\", implying it \\"just happened\\", almost \\"on its own\\". =North Germanic (Scandinavian)= The mediopassive is found in some contemporary Scandinavian languages like Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian (whereas for example Icelandic keeps up a formal distinction between the middle and the passive). The examples below are from Danish, but the situation is the same in Swedish and Norwegian. The passive use of the Danish mediopassive is probably predominant, but the medial use is quite frequent as well. Here are examples of sub-categories of the middle voice. # Reflexive: ' (\\"I remember my youth\\"/\\"I'm reminded of my youth\\"). The form ' is usually called passive, but the meaning is medial. The present active ' means \\"remind(s)\\". Historically, ' is a contraction of the active forms and the reflexive pronoun: ' (\\"she reminds herself\\") ‚Üí ' (\\"she remembers\\"). \\"She\\" is both the agent and the patient, so the expression works in much the same way as reflexive middle forms of ancient Indo-European languages like Greek and Sanskrit. # Reciprocal: ' is the everyday expression equivalent in Danish to the English \\"See you.\\" The present active is ' (we see); the mediopassive (commonly called passive) form is historically derived thus: ' (\\"they see themselves\\") ‚Üí ' (\\"they are seen\\" or \\"they see themselves/see each other\\"). The third person forms have since been generalized by analogy to the first and second person, and as the future progressive is often expressed with simple present in Danish, the meaning is, \\"We'll be seeing each other.\\" # Autocausative: ' (\\"He gets/is happy with his gift\\"), from '. =Armenian= Classical Armenian had a mediopassive form that was marked by changing the verb's thematic vowel instead of with a unique conjugation like in other Indo-European languages. Modern Armenian has retained some of these active/mediopassive pairs, but the distinction between the two voices is no longer productive.

The titular Bishop of Doberus, he is perhaps most famous for his revision of the Douay‚ÄìRheims translation of the Bible. Early life Challoner was born in Lewes, Sussex, on 29 September 1691. His father, also Richard Challoner, was married by licence granted on 17 January, either 1690 or 1691, to Grace (n√©e Willard) at Ringmer, Sussex, on 10 February. After the death of his father, who was a Presbyterian winecooper (wine-barrel maker), his mother, now reduced to poverty, became housekeeper to the Catholic Gage family, at Firle, Sussex. It is not known for sure whether she was originally a Roman Catholic, or whether she subsequently became one under the influence of a Catholic household and surroundings. In any case, thus it came about that Richard was brought up as a Catholic, although he was not baptized a Roman Catholic until he was about thirteen years old. This was at Warkworth, Northamptonshire, seat of a recusant Roman Catholic family, that of George Holman, whose wife, Lady Anastasia Holman, was a daughter of Blessed William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford, a Catholic unjustly condemned and beheaded in the Titus Oates hysteria of 1678. Education and academic career in France In 1705 young Richard was sent to the English College at Douai (France) on a sort of scholarship, entering the English College on 29 July. He was to spend the next twenty-five years there, first as student, then as professor, and as vice- president of the university of Douai. At the age of twenty-one he was chosen to teach the classes of rhetoric and poetry, which were the two senior classes in the humanities. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in divinity from the University of Douai in 1719, and was appointed professor of philosophy, a post which he held for eight years. At this period, though it was no longer necessary to have aliases, he was known by his mother's surname of Willard. His nickname was \\"Book\\". Ordained a priest at Tournai on 28 March 1716, in 1720 he was chosen by the president, Robert Witham, to be his vice-president, an office which involved the supervision of both professors and students. At the same time he was appointed professor of theology and prefect of studies, so that he had the direction of the whole course of studies. Though in 1727 he defended his public thesis and obtained a doctorate in divinity, Challoner's success as a teacher was probably due rather to his untiring industry and devotion to this work than to any extraordinary mental gifts. He was not considered an original thinker, but his gift lay in enforcing the spiritual reality of the doctrines he was expounding. Challoner has been described as being gentle, cheerful, generous to the poor, and able to instill confidence in others. Return to England Having in 1708 taken the college oath, binding himself to return to England, when required, to labour on the mission, in 1730 Challoner was given permission to embark for England on August 18, and was stationed in London. There he entered into the work of the ministry. Though the penal laws were no longer enforced with extreme severity, the life of many Catholic priests was still a difficult one, especially in London. Disguised as a layman in London, Challoner ministered to his flock there, celebrating Mass secretly in obscure ale-houses, cockpits, and wherever small gatherings could assemble without exciting remark.Langham, Mark. \\"Bishop Richard Challoner\\", Westminster Cathedral, 12 January 2007 In this regard, he was an untiring worker, and spent much time in the poorest quarters of the town and in the prisons. Recent scholarship notes, however, that the English Catholic community was not as marginalized as might be thought today, especially for those recusant Catholics whose social position gave them access to the courtly centers of power and patronage.See Gabriel Glickman's The English Catholic Community, 1688‚Äì1745, (London: Boydell and Brewer, 2009) and Steve Pincus, 1688: The First Modern Revolution (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009), pp. 432-434. Challoner avoided the houses of the rich, preferred to live and work among the poor of London, and in his spare hours gave himself to study and writing, which ultimately enabled him to produce several works of instruction and controversy. His first published work, a little book of meditations under the quaint title of Think Well On't https://archive.org/details/thinkwellontorre00chalrich dated from 1728. The controversial treatises which he published in rapid succession from London attracted much attention, particularly his Catholic Christian Instructed (1737), which was prefaced by a witty reply to Conyers Middleton's Letter from Rome, showing an Exact Conformity between Popery and Paganism. Challoner was the author over the years of numerous controversial and devotional works, which have been frequently reprinted and translated into various languages. In 1740 he brought out a new prayer book for the laity, the Garden of the Soul, which until the mid 20th century remained a favourite work of devotion, though the many editions that have since appeared have been so altered that little of the original work remains. Of his historical works, the most valuable is one which was intended to be a Roman Catholic response to the Protestant John Foxe's well-known martyrology, Foxe's Book of Martyrs. It is entitled Memoirs of Missionary Priests and other Catholicks of both Sexes who suffered Death or Imprisonment in England on account of their Religion, from the year 1577 1577 was the last year of the Catholic Mary I of England till the end of the reign of Charles II (2 vols. 1741, frequently reprinted). This work, compiled from original records, was for a long while the only published source on the list of Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation, including the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales, among others. It remains a standard work on the subject. In 1745 he produced anonymously his longest and most learned book, Britannia Sancta, containing the lives of the British, English, Scottish, and Irish saints, an interesting work of hagiography which was later superseded by that of Alban Butler and then by more recent publications. In 1738 the president of Douai College, Robert Witham, died, and efforts were made by the superiors of the college to have Challoner appointed as his successor. But Bishop Benjamin Petre, the Vicar Apostolic of the London District, who already had Challoner as his vicar general, opposed this on the ground that he desired to have him as his own coadjutor with right of succession. The Sacred Congregation of Propaganda Fide had apparently already arranged Challoner's appointment as President of Douai, but Petre's representations prevailed, and papal briefs were issued on 12 September 1739, appointing Challoner to the see of Debra in partibus. These briefs, however, were not carried into effect, for the bishop- elect, endeavouring to escape the responsibility of the episcopate, raised the point that he had been born and brought up a Protestant. The delay so caused lasted a whole year, and it was not until 24 November 1740 that new briefs were issued. The consecration took place on 29 January 1741 in the private chapel at Hammersmith, London. The new bishop's first work was a visitation of the district, the first methodical visitation of which there is any record since the creation of the vicariate in 1688. The district included ten counties, besides the Channel Islands and the British possessions in America‚Äîchiefly Maryland and Pennsylvania and some West Indian islands. The missions beyond the seas could not be visited at all, and even the home counties took nearly three years. His flock included the old Catholic nobility families in the countryside and recently arrived indigent Irish workers.Hyland, Willam P., \\"Bishop Richard Challoner & the Idea of the Primitive Church\\", Touchstones, March/April 1999 As an administrator he provided for his people a suitable prayer and meditation book, as well as convenient editions of the scriptures, the Imitation of Christ, and the catechism of Christian doctrine. Beyond this literary work, he caused two schools for boys to be opened, one at Standon Lordship, later represented by St. Edmund's College, Old Hall, and the other at Sedgley Park, in Staffordshire. Finance was a serious problem, but there were legal ones as well, as Catholics were forbidden to buy land or to run schools; so various subterfuges had to be used to get round the law. He also founded a school for poor girls at Brook Green, Hammersmith, besides assisting the already existing convent school there. He instituted conferences among the London clergy, and he was instrumental in founding the \\"Benevolent Society for the Relief of the Aged and Infirm Poor\\". His private life was marked by scrupulous mortification, while large charity passed through his hands. Revision of English Bible Challoner devoted much energy and time to revising the English Catholic Bible. He had long perceived a need to update the language of the Douay‚ÄìRheims Bible that had appeared over the years 1582‚Äì1610. Challoner did not set out to make a new translation; his aim was to remove antiquated words and expressions so that the Bible would be more readable and understandable by ordinary folk. While still at University of Douai, he was one of the approving prelates for a revision of the Rheims New Testament published in 1730 by the college president, Robert Witham. After returning to England, he and Francis Blyth published in 1738 another revision of Rheims in an attractive large folio edition. Challoner's more important work would appear over the years 1749‚Äì1752. An edition of the New Testament appeared in 1749, and another, together with the first edition of the Old Testament, in 1750. Between the two editions of the New Testament there are few differences, but the next edition, published in 1752, had important changes both in text and notes, the variations numbering over two thousand. All revisions attributed to Challoner were published anonymously. It is unclear to what extent he was personally involved in, or even approved of, the various changes. Challoner is believed to have had the assistance of Robert Pinkard (alias Typper), the London agent for Douay College, in preparing the 1749 and 1750 revisions. The chief points to note in these revisions are the elimination of the obscure and literal translations from the Latin in which the original version abounds, the alteration of obsolete terms and spelling, a closer approximation in some respects to the Anglican Authorised Version (for instance, the substitution of \\"the Lord\\" for \\"our Lord\\"), and finally the printing of the verses separately. Other works In 1753 Challoner brought out another of his best-known works, the Meditations for every Day of the Year, a book which has passed through numerous editions and been translated into French and Italian. Challoner‚Äôs goal was to make the classics of Catholic Spirituality accessible to Catholics, in English. To this end he translated De Imitatione Christi in 1737 (entitled \\"The Following of Christ\\"), a translation of St. Augustine‚Äôs Confessions in 1739, and in 1757 The Life of the Holy Mother, St. Teresa, a biography of St. Teresa of Avila drawn from her writings. As one of the Protestant criticisms of Roman Catholics was that many of the practices of the Catholic Church were departures from the practice of the early Church, he sought to demonstrate continuity of Catholicism with the primitive Church. Britannia Sancta was published in 1745. With this book Challoner hoped to promote among Catholics a pride in their ancestry, and to show them that their present sufferings were not as hard as those endured by the martyrs and saints of the past.Reynolds, E. E., \\"Bishop Richard Challoner\\", Catholic Pamphlets Besides the works mentioned above, and a good number of tracts, other writings, whose titles convey the atmosphere of an era, include: * Think Well On't, or, Reflections on the great truths of the Christian Religion : for every day in the month : and The thirty days' prayer (1841) * Grounds of Catholic Doctrine (1732); * Unerring Authority of the Catholic Church (1732); Short History of the Protestant Religion (1733); * A Roman Catholick's Reasons why He cannot Conform (1734); The Touchstone of the New Religion (1734); * The Young Gentleman Instructed in the Grounds of the Christian Religion (1735); * A Specimen of the Spirit of the Dissenting Teachers (1736); The Catholic Christian Instructed (1737); * The Ground of the Old Religion (1742); * A Letter to a Friend concerning the Infallibility of the Church (1743); * A Papist Misrepresented and Represented, abridged from Gother; Remarks on Two Letters against Popery (1751); * Instructions for the Jubilee (1751); * The Wonders of God in the Wilderness: Lives of the Fathers of the Desert (1755); * The Life of St Teresa, abridged from Woodhead (1757); * Manual of Prayers (1758); * A Caveat against the Methodists (1760); * The City of God of the New Testament (1760); * The Morality of the Bible (1762); * Devotion of Catholics to the Blessed Virgin (1764); * Rules of Life for a Christian (1766), * The Lord's prayer and the Angelic salutation. Later career In 1753 Pope Benedict XIV put an end to the long disputes that had been carried on between the secular clergy and the regular clergy, in the last stages of which Challoner took a leading part. There were several points at issue, but the matter was brought to a head over the contention put forward by the regulars, that they did not need the approbation of the vicars apostolic to hear confessions. The bishops opposed this and, after a struggle lasting for several years, obtained a final settlement of this and other questions, a settlement, in the main, satisfactory to the bishops. In 1758 Bishop Petre died, and Challoner, as his coadjutor, succeeded him at once as Vicar Apostolic of the London District. He was, however, nearly seventy years old, and was so ill that he was forced immediately to apply for a coadjutor in his turn. The Holy See appointed James Talbot to this office, and with the help of the younger prelate, whose assistance considerably reduced his labour, Challoner's health somewhat recovered. From this time, however, he lived almost entirely in London, the visitations being carried out by Talbot. Challoner continued to write, and almost every year published a new book, but they were more usually translations or abstracts, such as The Historical Part of the Old and New Testament. One more work of original value remained, and that was his little British Martyrology published in 1761. Final years Plaque at 44 Old Gloucester Street, London Tomb of Bishop Richard Challoner in Westminster Cathedral As a bishop, Challoner usually resided in London, though on occasion, as during the \\"No Popery\\" riots of 1780, he was obliged to retire into the country. Challoner's extensive activity is the more remarkable because his life was spent in hiding, owing to the state of the law, and often he had hurriedly to change his lodgings to escape the Protestant and/or Anglican informers, who were anxious to earn the government reward of ¬£100 for the conviction of a priest. One of these, John Payne, known as the \\"Protestant Carpenter\\", indicted Challoner, but was compelled to drop the proceedings, owing to some documents, which he had forged, falling into the hands of the bishop's lawyers. For some years Challoner and the London Catholic priests were continually harassed in this way. Finally the harassment was remedied by the Catholic Relief Act of 1778, by which priests were no longer liable to imprisonment for life. This concession speedily aroused religious dispute, and two years later the Gordon Riots broke out with rioters attacking any London building that was associated with Catholicism or owned by Catholics. From his hiding-place the bishop, now nearly ninety years of age, could hear the mob, who were searching for him with the intention of dragging him through the streets. They failed to find his refuge, and on the following day he escaped to Finchley, where he remained till the London riots came to an end. The aged Challoner never fully recovered from the shock of the riots. Six months later he was seized with paralysis, and died on 12 January 1781, aged 89. He was buried at Milton, Berkshire (present-day Oxfordshire) in the family vault of his friend Bryant Barrett in the Church of England parish church. In 1946 the body was reinterred in Westminster Cathedral. Legacy There are a number of schools named after Challoner; in Shortlands near Bromley, at Basingstoke and Richard Challoner School in New Malden Surrey, among others. In addition, the oldest post-Reformation Catholic school in England, St Edmund's College, Ware, a former seminary, in Hertfordshire (which Challoner himself helped to re- establish from Douay, France to its present site), named one of their five houses after him. The colour associated with the house is Royal Blue. The house is one of the original houses in the school when the house system was established in 1922.\\"Challoner\\", St. Edmund's College & Prep School The Bishop Challoner Catholic Collegiate School in Stepney was founded by the Sisters of Mercy for him.

Fredo is portrayed by American actor John Cazale in the Francis Ford Coppola 1972 film adaptation and in the 1974 sequel, The Godfather Part II. He is the second son of the mafia don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro). Fredo is the younger brother of Sonny (James Caan) and the elder brother to Michael (Al Pacino) and sister, Connie (Talia Shire). Corleone family consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is his informally adopted brother. Being weaker and less intelligent than his brothers, Fredo has little power or status within the Corleone crime family. In the novel, Fredo's primary weakness is his womanizing, a habit he develops after moving to Las Vegas and which earns his father's disfavor. In the films, Fredo's feelings of personal inadequacy and his inability to act effectively on his own behalf are character flaws leading to greater consequences. AppearancesThe Godfather= In a pivotal scene in the novel and film, Fredo is with his father when assassins working for drug kingpin Virgil Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) gun down Don Corleone in the street. Fredo, terrified, drops his gun, failing to return fire. He sits on the curb next to his severely wounded father, weeping. In the novel, Fredo is sickened after witnessing his father being shot, going into shock. To aid Fredo's recovery and protect him from possible reprisals, Sonny sends his younger brother to Las Vegas under the protection of Don Anthony Molinari of San Francisco. While in Las Vegas, Fredo learns the casino trade and becomes acquainted with former hitman Moe Greene (Alex Rocco), who runs a major Vegas hotel that the Corleone family bankrolled. When Fredo's womanizing starts affecting business, Greene slaps him in public. After Sonny is assassinated, Vito chooses Michael as his successor of the Corleone Family. This creates a lasting rift between the two surviving brothers. When Michael learns that Greene slapped Fredo, he is angered and confronts Greene, but is also dismayed that Fredo has fallen under Greene's influence. When Fredo scolds Michael for being openly hostile to Greene, Michael in turn berates Fredo for openly taking sides against the family during a meeting with Greene, warning him never to do so again. =The Godfather Part II= By the beginning of The Godfather Part II, Fredo has become Michael's underboss, though he has only nominal power. During a large family gathering, Fredo is unable to control his intoxicated wife, Deanna Dunn (Marianna Hill). When she dances and flirts with another man, he furiously drags her off the dance floor and threatens to hit her, though Deanna drunkenly mocks him until one of Michael's staff hauls her away. Hagen is ordered to bring Senator Pat Geary (G. D. Spradlin) under the Corleone Family's control to gain his assistance in obtaining gambling licenses. After the senator refuses to help, he is implicated in a prostitute's murder, which the film implies was a setup by Michael to bring the senator to heel. Hagen offers the Corleone family's help in eliminating the problem in exchange for the senator's \\"friendship\\". Hagen tells Geary that Fredo operates the brothel, and \\"it will be as if she never existed\\". Geary agrees to their terms. Fredo later betrays Michael after being approached by Johnny Ola (Dominic Chianese), an associate of rival gangster Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg). Ola and Roth tell Fredo that Michael is being particularly difficult in business negotiations between Roth's organization and the Corleone family. Fredo secretly agrees to aid them in exchange for compensation. An attempt is made on Michael's life. The film never reveals what specific assistance Fredo provides Ola and Roth against Michael, how much he knew of their intentions, or what he was offered in return. While in Havana negotiating with Roth, Michael discovers that Fredo is the family traitor behind the assassination attempt on him. After telling Michael that he had never met Ola before, Fredo later carelessly tells Geary that he had been to a nightclub with Ola. Michael overhears the conversation and realizes that Fredo is the traitor within the family. He confronts Fredo, delivering the kiss of death. Amid the chaos of American-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista fleeing Fidel Castro's rebel army, Michael pleads with Fredo to leave the country with him. Frightened, Fredo runs away into the crowd. Michael's men eventually locate Fredo and convince him to return home. Michael is indicted by a Senate subcommittee investigating organized crime. Michael's former caporegime, Frank Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo), is scheduled to testify against Michael at the hearing. A few days before the hearing, Michael asks Fredo what he knows regarding Roth's plans. Fredo claims that he did not know they would make an attempt on Michael's life, and that if he helped Roth, \\"there was something in it for me, on my own\\". He tells Michael that he resents being passed over to succeed their father; he believes that, as the older brother, he should have taken over the family business after Vito's death. When pressed by Michael, Fredo reveals that the Senate commission's lawyer is on Roth's payroll. Michael disowns Fredo, and privately instructs his personal assassin Al Neri (Richard Bright) that nothing is to happen to Fredo while their mother is alive; the implication being that Fredo will be killed after her death. At their mother's funeral, and at their sister Connie's urging, Michael seemingly forgives Fredo; however, it is merely a ploy to draw Fredo in and have him killed. Soon after, while Fredo and Neri are fishing on Lake Tahoe, Neri executes Fredo as he is reciting the Hail Mary, as Michael watches from his house. Fredo makes a final appearance in the movie's penultimate scene, a flashback to December 1941. It emerges that Fredo was the only family member to support Michael's decision to drop out of college and join the Marines after the attack on Pearl Harbor. =The Godfather Part III= Fredo appears only once in the third film, in a flashback depicting his death through archive footage. He is also mentioned many times throughout the film; the dialogue makes it clear that Michael is tormented with guilt over ordering his brother's death, and that it has alienated him from his ex-wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), and his son, Anthony (Franc D'Ambrosio), both of whom know that Michael ordered Fredo's death. The official explanation of Fredo's death, as related by Connie, is that he drowned, although it is left ambiguous whether Connie actually believes this. Michael himself cries out Fredo's name while having a diabetic stroke. Later in the film, he breaks down in tears while confessing having ordered Fredo's death to Cardinal Lamberto (Raf Vallone), who later becomes Pope John Paul I. Michael's daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola), asks her cousin and love interest, Vincent Corleone (Andy Garc√≠a), if Michael had Fredo killed, but Vincent says it is \\"just a story\\" and changes the subject. =Sequel novels=In The Godfather Returns Mark Winegardner's novel The Godfather Returns further expands upon the character of Fredo Corleone. It includes explanations for some questions left open by the films, such as the details of Fredo's betrayal of Michael in The Godfather Part II, and how, as was revealed in The Godfather Part III, Anthony knew the truth about Fredo's death. The novel reveals that Fredo is bisexual, and it also implies that he was molested as a child by his parish priest. Rival gangster Louie Russo exploits rumors of Fredo's sexuality to make Michael look weak, and tries to have him killed while he is with a male lover. The novel also reveals that, in San Francisco, Fredo beats one of his lovers to death after the man recognizes him from a newspaper photo. Hagen covers up the resulting scandal by claiming Fredo killed the man in self- defense. Fredo also has liaisons with many women, having \\"knocked up half the cocktail waitresses in Las Vegas\\". He meets Marguerite \\"Rita\\" Duvall, who Johnny Fontane sent to his room as a prank. Though hesitant, they have sex, and Fredo pays her to tell Johnny it was the best she had ever had. At Colma during the funeral for Don Molinari of San Francisco, Fredo gets the idea of setting up a necropolis in New Jersey. The Corleone family would buy the former cemetery land, now prime real estate, and also be a silent partner in the graveyard business. Fredo proposes his plan to Michael, wanting to impress and convince him and others of his abilities. Michael, however, dismisses the plan as unrealistic. Fredo arrives at the Corleone Christmas party with Deanna Dunn, a fading movie starlet. A few months later they are married. Dunn gets Fredo bit parts in some of her movies. Later, in September 1957, Fredo's Hollywood connections allow him to get his own unsuccessful TV show, \\"The Fred Corleone Show\\", which airs irregularly, usually on Monday nights, until his death. Meanwhile, Fredo's alcoholism worsens. He discovers Deanna cheating on him with her co-star, and shoots up the car he bought her. When Deanna's co- star tries to attack him, Fredo knocks him unconscious and is arrested. Hagen bails him out, and they get in an argument about Fredo's recklessness and Hagen's blind loyalty to Michael. Despite this, Hagen gets Fredo cleared by claiming the incident was self-defense. Roth, Ola and traitorous Corleone family caporegime Nick Geraci use Fredo as a pawn to eliminate Michael. Geraci and Ola meet with Fredo, who is blind drunk after having a fight with his wife, and promise to make his necropolis idea a reality in return for information about Michael. Fredo supplies them with information about the Corleone family, particularly financial interests. Fredo's death plays out as it was filmed in The Godfather Part II. Anthony, about to go fishing with his uncle, is called away by his aunt Connie to go to Reno. He actually never leaves and instead, he is sent to his room, where, from his window, he sees Fredo and Neri out on the lake. Anthony hears a gunshot and sees Neri returning alone, explaining Godfather Part IIIs revelation that Anthony knows the truth about his uncle's death. In The Godfather's Revenge In Winegardner's 2006 sequel, The Godfather's Revenge, Fredo appears in one of Michael's dreams, warning him about an unspecified threat and asking him why he had his own brother killed. Much of the novel portrays Michael dealing with his guilt over Fredo's murder. In the final chapter of the book, Michael learns that Fredo had an illegitimate child with Michael's ex-girlfriend Rita Duvall.

Cuomo's comparison of the usage of \\"Fredo\\" to an ethnic slur caused debate on Twitter. Edward Falco, the author of 2012 novel The Family Corleone said he agreed with Cuomo that \\"Fredo\\" was directed as an ethnic slur, not just meaning someone weak and incompetent but a weak and incompetent Italian. It sounds close to \\"Guido,\\" he said, a more prominent insult toward Italian Americans, though he said Cuomo went \\"overboard\\" when he had compared it to the n-word. Others did not agree with his purported claim of it being an ethnic slur. See also * The Godfather (2006 video game) ‚Äì Fredo appears in the video game, and is voiced by Andrew Moxham.

He is the oldest son of the mafia don Vito Corleone and Carmela Corleone. He has two brothers, Fredo and Michael, and a sister, Connie. In the film, Sonny was portrayed by James Caan, who reprised his role for a flashback scene in The Godfather Part II. Director Francis Ford Coppola's son Roman Coppola played Sonny as a boy in the 1920s scenes of The Godfather Part II. Novel and film biography In both the novel and the movie, Sonny is the eldest of Vito Corleone's four children. Unlike his quiet, level-headed father, Sonny is fiery-tempered and prone to violence. At age 16, Sonny commits a robbery. When Peter Clemenza, Vito's right-hand man and Sonny's godfather, informs Vito about it, Vito demands his son explain himself. Sonny replies that he had witnessed Vito murder the \\"Black Hand\\" gangster Don Fanucci years before, and he now wants to join the \\"family business\\". Vito sends him to Clemenza for training. Sonny \\"makes his bones\\" at the age of 19. By his mid-20s, he is promoted to a caporegime in the Corleone family. By the end of World War II, he is his father's underboss and heir apparent, popular and feared as a merciless killer with a short-temper. Sonny is not without a sensitive side, however; at age 11, he brings home a homeless boy, Tom Hagen, demanding he be allowed to live with the family. Vito informally adopts Hagen, who eventually rises through the ranks to become Vito's consigliere. As the eldest child, Sonny acts as protector to his younger siblings and has a soft-spot for his youngest brother, Michael. While he can beat up and kill other men without hesitation, he cannot bring himself to harm women, children, or anyone unable to defend themselves. Sonny has four children with his wife Sandra. He also has several mistresses, including his sister Connie's friend Lucy Mancini. In the novel, Sandra allows ‚Äì and is grateful for ‚Äì his infidelities because she is unable to take the size of his penis. Sonny's life is upturned in 1945, when drug lord Virgil \\"The Turk\\" Sollozzo, backed by the Tattaglia family, approaches Vito with an offer to enter the narcotics trade. During the meeting, Sonny speaks out-of-turn, expressing an interest in the deal that Vito declined. Vito later castigates Sonny for revealing his thoughts to an outsider. Sollozzo later attempts to have Vito assassinated, believing Sonny, as his father's successor, will bring the Corleone family into the drug trade. The failed assassination attempt leaves Vito near death, making Sonny acting boss of the Corleone family. Sonny orders Clemenza to execute Vito's traitorous bodyguard Paulie Gatto. Sollozzo mounts a second assassination attempt on Vito at the hospital, which Michael prevents. Sonny then orders Bruno Tattaglia, son and underboss of Sollozzo's ally Philip Tattaglia, to be murdered. Sollozzo proposes that Michael to be sent to promote a truce. Sonny, believing it is a trick, refuses and demands that the other Mafia families hand over Sollozzo to the Corleone family or else face war. Hagen successfully convinces Sonny to wait because Captain Mark McCluskey, a corrupt NYPD captain on Sollozzo's payroll, has agreed to be Sollozzo's bodyguard. Hagen warns Sonny that killing McCluskey would violate a long-standing Mafia rule not to kill members of law enforcement, and that the backlash from rival Mafia families and law enforcement would be severe. Michael, who had before wanted nothing to do with the family business, volunteers to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey, arguing that McCluskey is fair game because he is a corrupt cop mixed up in the drug trade. Sonny is impressed with Michael's confidence and seriousness, but doubts that his \\"nice college boy\\" brother is capable of murder. Ultimately, however, he approves the hit. Michael meets with Sollozzo and McCluskey at an Italian restaurant in The Bronx, and kills both men. This ignites the New York underworld's first Mafia war in a decade. Sonny had arranged for Michael to flee to Sicily under the protection of Vito's friend, Don Tommasino. The war between the Five Families drags on, and Sonny, unable to break the stalemate, orders bloody raids that earn him a legendary reputation. He also begins plotting to take out the rival Mafia bosses. Emilio Barzini, Vito's rival and the power behind Sollozzo, enlists Connie's abusive husband, Carlo Rizzi, to help set a trap. Earlier, Sonny assaulted Carlo after he attacked Connie. To draw Sonny out into the open, Carlo provokes Connie into an argument before severely beating her. Hysterical and pained, she telephones the Corleone compound asking Sonny for help. Enraged, Sonny speeds towards Connie's apartment in Hell's Kitchen ahead of his bodyguards. At the Long Beach Causeway toll plaza, Barzini's men trap Sonny and shoot him. During a meeting with the other crime family Dons to establish peace, Vito realizes that Barzini masterminded Sonny's murder. After Michael returns from Sicily, he assumes Sonny's place as Vito's heir apparent. Vito and Michael secretly continue Sonny's plot to wipe out the other New York Dons to avenge Sonny's death and purge their rivals, once and for all. After Vito dies in 1955 from a heart attack, Michael has the other New York Dons murdered, including Barzini, who is shot twice in the back on the steps of a courthouse in broad daylight. Michael informs Carlo that the rival Dons have been killed and coerces Carlo's confession for his part in arranging Sonny's murder. Carlo admits Barzini was the mastermind. On Michael's orders, Clemenza garrotes Carlo to death. In a single strike, the Corleones become the most powerful crime family in the country.  Role in Godfather sequels  As well as appearing in the original film, The Godfather, Sonny is featured in the sequel, The Godfather Part II. In this film, he briefly appears in some scenes as an infant and as a young child. He makes a final appearance at the end of the film, in a flashback scene that portrays Vito's birthday celebration in 1941. Michael announces that he has dropped out of college and enlisted to fight in World War II. Sonny is furious at the decision, and he berates his brother for risking his life \\"for a bunch of strangers.\\" This scene also reveals that Sonny introduced Carlo to Connie, and the rest of the family, which led to their marriage. In The Godfather Part III, Vincent Corleone is introduced as Sonny's illegitimate son with Lucy Mancini. Vincent succeeds Michael as head of the Corleone family at the end of the film. Vincent's existence in the film contradicts Puzo's original novel, which stated that Lucy never bore a child with Sonny. = Family = * Vito Corleone‚Äîfather; played by Marlon Brando and by Robert De Niro as young adult Vito Corleone * Carmela Corleone‚Äîmother; played by Morgana King * Sandra Corleone‚Äîwife; played by Julie Gregg * Tom Hagen‚Äîadoptive brother; played by Robert Duvall * Fredo Corleone‚Äîbrother; played by John Cazale * Michael Corleone‚Äîbrother; played by Al Pacino * Constanzia \\"Connie\\" Corleone‚Äîsister; played by Talia Shire * Mary Corleone‚Äîniece; played by Sofia Coppola * Anthony Corleone‚Äînephew; played by Anthony Gounaris (The Godfather); played by James Gounaris (The Godfather Part II); played by Franc D'Ambrosio in The Godfather Part III * Francesca Corleone‚Äîdaughter, born 1937 * Kathryn Corleone‚Äîdaughter, born 1937 * Frank Corleone‚Äîson, born 1940 * Santino Corleone Jr.‚Äîson, born 1945 * Vincent Corleone‚Äîson with Lucy Mancini born 1948, played by Andy Garc√≠a  Behind the scenes  * Coppola staged Sonny's death scene in The Godfather to be reminiscent of the final death scene of Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) and Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) in Bonnie and Clyde. * Coppola had the car radio play the broadcast of the baseball playoff game won by Bobby Thomson hitting the Shot Heard Round the World. This would place Sonny's death on October 3, 1951, contradicting the novel by several years. * Among the actors auditioning for the role of Michael during casting for The Godfather, one unknown off- Broadway actor named Robert De Niro also read for Sonny's part, as well as Michael's and Carlo's, without success. Raw footage of him in the scene where Paulie Gatto offers to kill Rizzi can be seen on the DVD. Eventually, Coppola cast Caan in the role and gave De Niro the part of Paulie, but he \\"traded\\" him to the film The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight for Al Pacino, who soon got the part of Michael. Anthony Perkins not only auditioned for Sonny, but also for Tom Hagen. * Originally Caan was to be cast as the main character Michael Corleone (Sonny's youngest brother), while Carmine Caridi was signed as Sonny. However Coppola demanded that the role of Michael be played by Al Pacino instead. The studio agreed to Pacino but insisted on having Caan be cast as Sonny, so he remained in the production. * Caan was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in the film, competing with co-stars Pacino and Robert Duvall, giving the movie three entries in that category.

From left: General of the Infantry Hermann Reinecke; Dr. Roland Freisler, president of the court; Ernst Lautz, chief public prosecutor The People's Court () was a ' (\\"special court\\") of Nazi Germany, set up outside the operations of the constitutional frame of law. Its headquarters were originally located in the former Prussian House of Lords in Berlin, later moved to the former K√∂nigsberg Wilhelmsgymnasium at Bellevuestrasse 15 in Potsdamer Platz (the location now occupied by the Sony Center; a marker is located on the sidewalk nearby).Crime, Guns, and Videotape: Meet \\"The People's Court\\" The court was established in 1933 by order of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, in response to his dissatisfaction at the outcome of the Reichstag fire trial, in which all but one of the defendants were acquitted. The court had jurisdiction over a rather broad array of \\"political offenses\\", which included crimes like black marketeering, work slowdowns, defeatism, and treason against the Third Reich. These crimes were viewed by the court as Wehrkraftzersetzung (\\"disintegration of defensive capability\\") and were accordingly punished severely; the death penalty was meted out in numerous cases. The Court handed down an enormous number of death sentences under Judge-President Roland Freisler, including those that followed the plot to kill Hitler on 20 July 1944. Many of those found guilty by the Court were executed in Pl√∂tzensee Prison in Berlin. The proceedings of the court were often even less than show trials in that some cases, such as that of Sophie Scholl and her brother Hans Scholl and fellow White Rose activists, trials were concluded in less than an hour without evidence being presented or arguments made by either side. The president of the court often acted as prosecutor, denouncing defendants, then pronouncing his verdict and sentence without objection from defense counsel, who usually remained silent throughout. It almost always sided with the prosecution, to the point that from 1943 onwards being hauled before it was tantamount to a death sentence. While Nazi Germany was not a rule of law state, the People's Court frequently dispensed with even the nominal laws and procedures of regular German trials, and was thus easily characterized as a kangaroo court. Manner of proceedings There was no presumption of innocence nor could the defendants adequately represent themselves or consult counsel. A proceeding at the People's Court would follow an initial indictment in which a state or city prosecutor would forward the names of the accused to the Volksgerichtshof for charges of a political nature. Defendants were hardly ever allowed to speak to their attorneys beforehand and when they did the defense lawyer would usually simply answer questions about how the trial would proceed and refrain from any legal advice. In at least one documented case (the trial of the \\"White Rose\\" conspirators), the defense lawyer assigned to Sophie Scholl chastised her the day before the trial, stating that she would pay for her crimes. The People's Court proceedings began when the accused were led to a prisoner's dock under armed police escort. The presiding judge would read the charges and then call the accused forward for \\"examination\\". Although the court had a prosecutor, it was usually the judge who asked the questions. Defendants were often berated during the examination and never allowed to respond with any sort of lengthy reply. After a barrage of insults and condemnation, the accused would be ordered back to the dock with the order \\"examination concluded\\". After examination, the defense attorney would be asked if they had any statements or questions. Defense lawyers were present simply as a formality and hardly ever rose to speak. The judge would then ask the defendants for a statement during which time more insults and berating comments would be shouted at the accused. The verdict, which was almost always \\"guilty\\", would then be announced and the sentence handed down at the same time. In all, an appearance before the People's Court could take as little as fifteen minutes. From 1934 to 1945, the court sentenced 10,980 people to prison and imposed the death penalty on 5,179 more who were convicted of high treason.Wachsmann, Hitler's Prisons: Legal Terror in Nazi Germany. Yale University Press (2004), pp. 398-99. About 1,000 were acquitted.R√§biger, Rocco, Die Geschichte des Volksgerichtshofes (History of the People's Court) (in German) stating that in some 7,000 cases 18,000 defendants were convicted and 5,000 of those were sentenced to death; about 1,000 were acquitted. Prior to the Battle of Stalingrad, there was a higher percentage of cases in which not guilty verdicts were handed down on indictments. In some cases, this was due to defense lawyers presenting the accused as naive or the defendant adequately explaining the nature of the political charges against them. However, in nearly two-thirds of such cases, the defendants would be re- arrested by the Gestapo following the trial and sent to a concentration camp. After the defeat at Stalingrad, and with a growing fear in the German government regarding defeatism amongst the population, the People's Court became far more ruthless and hardly anyone brought before the tribunal escaped a guilty verdict.Roberts, G., Victory at Stalingrad: The Battle That Changed History, Routledge (2002), Trials of August 1944 upright upright The best-known trials in the People's Court began on 7 August 1944, in the aftermath of the 20 July plot that year. The first eight men accused were Erwin von Witzleben, Erich Hoepner, Paul von Hase, Peter Yorck von Wartenburg, Helmuth Stieff, Robert Bernardis, Friedrich Klausing, and Albrecht von Hagen. The trials were held in the imposing Great Hall of the Berlin Chamber Court on El√üholzstrasse, which was bedecked with swastikas for the occasion. There were around 300 spectators, including Ernst Kaltenbrunner and selected civil servants, party functionaries, military officers and journalists. A film camera ran behind the red-robed Roland Freisler so that Hitler could view the proceedings, and to provide footage for newsreels and a documentary entitled Traitors Before the People's Court.Robert Edwin Hertzstein, The War That Hitler Won p283 Intended to be used in The German Weekly Review, it was not shown at the time, and turned out to be the last documentary made for the newsreel. The accused were forced to wear shabby clothes, denied neck ties and belts or suspenders for their pants, and were marched into the courtroom handcuffed to policemen. The proceedings began with Freisler announcing he would rule on \\"...the most horrific charges ever brought in the history of the German people.\\" Freisler was an admirer of Andrey Vyshinsky, the chief prosecutor of the Soviet purge trials, and copied Vyshinsky's practice of heaping loud and violent abuse on defendants. The 62-year-old Field Marshal von Witzleben was the first to stand before Freisler and he was immediately castigated for giving a brief Nazi salute. He faced further humiliating insults while holding onto his trouser waistband. Next, former Colonel-General Erich Hoepner, dressed in a cardigan, faced Freisler, who addressed him as \\"Schweinehund\\". When he said that he was not a Schweinehund, Freisler asked him what zoological category he thought he fitted into. The accused were unable to consult their lawyers, who were not seated near them. None of them were allowed to address the court at length, and Freisler interrupted any attempts to do so. However, Major General Helmuth Stieff attempted to raise the issue of his motives before being shouted down, and Witzleben managed to call out \\"You may hand us over to the executioner, but in three months' time, the disgusted and harried people will bring you to book and drag you alive through the dirt in the streets!\\" All were condemned to death by hanging, and the sentences were carried out shortly afterwards in Pl√∂tzensee Prison. Another trial of plotters was held on 10 August. On that occasion the accused were Erich Fellgiebel, Alfred Kranzfelder, Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenburg, Georg Hansen, and Berthold Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg. On 15 August, Wolf- Heinrich Graf von Helldorf, Egbert Hayessen, Hans Bernd von Haeften, and Adam von Trott zu Solz were condemned to death by Freisler. On 21 August, the accused were Fritz Thiele, Friedrich Gustav Jaeger, and Ulrich Wilhelm Graf Schwerin von Schwanenfeld who was able to mention the \\"...many murders committed at home and abroad\\" as a motivation for his actions. On 30 August, Colonel-General Carl-Heinrich von St√ºlpnagel, who had blinded himself in a suicide attempt, was led into the court and condemned to death along with Caesar von Hofacker, Hans Otfried von Linstow, and Eberhard Finckh. Bombing Ruins of the People's Court, as photographed in 1951 Field Marshal von Witzleben's prediction of Roland Freisler's fate proved slightly incorrect, as he died in a bombing raid in February 1945, approximately half a year later. On 3 February 1945, Freisler was conducting a Saturday session of the People's Court, when USAAF Eighth Air Force bombers attacked Berlin. Government and Nazi Party buildings were hit, including the Reich Chancellery, the Gestapo headquarters, the Party Chancellery and the People's Court. According to one report, Freisler hastily adjourned court and had ordered that day's prisoners to be taken to a shelter, but paused to gather that day's files. Freisler was killed when an almost direct hit on the building caused him to be struck down by a beam in his own courtroom.Granberg, Jerje. AP dispatch from Stockholm, reprinted as \\"Berlin, Nerves Racked By Air Raids, Fears Russian Army Most,\\" Oakland Tribune, 23 February 1945, p. 1.

Judge-Presidents of the People's CourtLegal aftermath after World War II In 1956 the German Federal High Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) granted the so-called \\"Judges' Privilege\\" to those that had been part of the Volksgerichthof. This prevented the prosecution of the former Volksgerichthof members on the basis that their actions had been legal under the laws in effect during the Third Reich. The only member of the Volksgerichthof ever to be held liable for his actions was Chief Public Prosecutor , who in 1947 was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment by a US Military Tribunal, during the Judges' Trial, one of the \\"subsequent Nuremberg proceedings\\". Ernst Lautz was pardoned after serving less than four years of his sentence and was granted a government pension. One People‚Äôs Judge of Bremen Heino von Heimburg died 1945 a POW in USSR.

It is considered to be the place where the Inca Empire came to an end with the capture and eventual execution of the Inca Emperor Atahualpa.Ravines, Rogger; El cuarto del rescate de Atahualpa, 1532‚Äì1986; Lima: Instituto Nacional de Cultura, 1987. Capture of Emperor Atahualpa (1532) The Inca-Spanish confrontation in Cajamarca When Francisco Pizarro arrived in Cajamarca on November 15, 1532, he sent a messenger to Atahualpa, proposing they meet in the main plaza. Pizarro decided to send a friar, Vincente de Valverde, along with an interpreter (Felipillo) to speak with Atahualpa. The next day, on November 16, 1532, Friar Valverde presented himself to Atahualpa and explained through the interpreter the mysteries of Catholic religion, and that, on account of their heathenism, the pope had granted Atahualpa's kingdom to the Spaniards. Atahualpa professed not to understand the tenor of this discourse, and would not resign his kingdom, saying he would \\"be no man's tributary.\\" Upon hearing this, the friar gave a Bible to Atahualpa, who, after merely observing it and turning a few pages, threw the book on the floor. Atahualpa then demanded a full account of the presence of the Spaniards in his land. At this point Pizarro and his forces decided to come out on horseback with firearms, causing many of Atahualpa's army to flee upon hearing the sounds of artillery and arquebus. Many natives died as they tried to fight against the better-armed Spaniards. Thereafter, Pizarro went on to look for Atahualpa himself, who was shielded by his faithful nobles who, in the end, were also captured by the Spaniards. Some scholars have stated that Vincente de Valverde did not signal the attack on the Incans.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15265a.htm It was during this time that Atahualpa gave orders for the execution of his half-brother, Hu√°scar, who he believed was an obstacle to his ruling of the empire. Atahualpa gave these orders, hoping to prevent Pizarro from carrying out his threat to \\"determine which of the two had best title to the sceptre of the Incas.\\" Trial and execution of Atahualpa (1533) After the battle of Cajamarca, Atahualpa offered Pizarro to buy his liberty by filling the room where he was kept prisoner with gold and the two following rooms with silver, up to the level of the reach of his arm. The room was 6.70 m (22 feet) long and 5.18 m wide (17 feet) long, while the red line marking the height of the Inca's reach, was 2.75 m (9 feet) high. Atahualpa also offered to twice fill a smaller room with silver, asking for two months to do so.Prescott, W.H., 2011, The History of the Conquest of Peru, Digireads.com Publishing, The total collection of the gold, after being melted down into standard ingots, and before division amongst the Spaniards, amounted to 1,326,539 pesos de oro, worth 15,500,000 in 1847 US dollars. This equates to nearly half a billion dollars in today's money. The silver amounted to 51,610 marks. Some of the most beautiful articles were saved for the emperor's royal fifth, which included vases, imitations of plants and animals, and a fountain. The Inca now demanded to be set free. Diego de Almagro demanded the Inca's death, necessary for peace and in the interests of the Spanish crown, though Pizarro and Hernando de Soto were reluctant. Pizarro finally conceded to a trial, acting as a judge alongside Almagro. The twelve charges included usurpation of the crown, assassination of his brother Hu√°scar, squandering public revenues, idolatry, adultery, and attempting to incite an insurrection. He was found guilty and sentenced to be burned alive that night. Father Vincente de Valverde signed the judgement stating, \\"in his opinion, the Inca, at all events, deserved death.\\" Atahualpa turned to Pizarro and exclaimed, \\"What have I done, or my children, that I should meet such a fate? And from your hands, too, you, who have met with friendship and kindness from my people, with whom I have shared my treasures, who have received nothing but benefits from my hands!\\" Two hours after sunset on 29 Aug. 1533, the Inca was prepared to be burned at the stake, when Friar Valverde offered death by garrote, if Atahualpa would consent to be baptized. The Inca agreed, assuming the name Francisco Atahualpa in honor of Francisco Pizarro. His last requests to Pizarro were that his remains be transported to Quito, and that he have compassion on his children. After Atahualpa was executed, the end of the \\"Tahuantinsuyo\\" (Inca Empire) was near, with the Spanish conquest of Peru.

A real Character at the late Masquerade\\", mezzotint by Philip Dawe, 1773 \\"What is this my Son Tom?\\", 1774 A macaroni (or formerly maccaroni)OED; Compare fop. in mid-18th-century England was a fashionable fellow who dressed and even spoke in an outlandishly affected and epicene manner. The term pejoratively referred to a man who \\"exceeded the ordinary bounds of fashion\\"The Macaroni and Theatrical Magazine, inaugural issue, 1772, quoted in Amelia Rauser, \\"Hair, Authenticity, and the Self-Made Macaroni\\", Eighteenth-Century Studies 38.1 (2004:101-117) (on-line abstract). in terms of clothes, fastidious eating, and gambling. He mixed Continental affectations with his English nature, like a practitioner of macaronic verse (which mixed English and Latin to comic effect), laying himself open to satire: The macaronis were precursor to the dandies, who came as a more masculine reaction to the excesses of the macaroni, far from their present connotation of effeminacy.  Origins and etymology  Young men who had been to Italy on the Grand Tour had developed a taste for maccaroni, a type of pasta little known in England then, and so they were said to belong to the Macaroni Club. They would refer to anything that was fashionable or √† la mode as \\"very maccaroni\\". Rauser 2004 Horace Walpole wrote to a friend in 1764 of \\"the Macaroni Club, which is composed of all the traveled young men who wear long curls and spying-glasses\\". The \\"club\\" was not a formal one; the expression was particularly used to characterize fops who dressed in high fashion with tall, powdered wigs with a chapeau bras on top that could only be removed on the point of a sword. The shop of engravers and printsellers Mary and Matthew Darly in the fashionable West End of London sold their sets of satirical \\"macaroni\\" caricature prints, published between 1771 and 1773. The new Darly shop became known as \\"the Macaroni Print-Shop\\". The Italian term maccherone, when figuratively meaning \\"blockhead, fool\\", was apparently not related to this British usage, though both were derived from the name of the pasta shape. Examples of usage In 1773, James Boswell was on tour in Scotland with the stout and serious-minded essayist and lexicographer Dr. Samuel Johnson, the least dandified of Londoners. Johnson was awkward in the saddle, and Boswell ribbed him: \\"You are a delicate Londoner; you are a maccaroni; you can't ride.\\"James Boswell, Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, 1785, chapter 7 available on-line ; he liked it well enough to repeat it in his Life of Dr. Johnson. In Oliver Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer (1773), a misunderstanding is discovered and young Marlow finds that he has been mistaken; he cries out, \\"So then, all's out, and I have been damnably imposed on. O, confound my stupid head, I shall be laughed at over the whole town. I shall be stuck up in caricatura in all the print-shops. The Dullissimo Maccaroni. To mistake this house of all others for an inn, and my father's old friend for an innkeeper!\\" The song \\"Yankee Doodle\\" from the time of the American Revolutionary War mentions a man who \\"stuck a feather in his hat and called it macaroni.\\" Dr. Richard Shuckburgh was a British surgeon and also the author of the song's lyrics; the joke which he was making was that the Yankees were naive enough to believe that a feather in the hat was a sufficient mark of a macaroni. Whether or not these were alternative lyrics sung in the British army, they were enthusiastically taken up by the Americans themselves.See Yankee Doodle variations and parodies.

The schemes utilized similar elements with some differences in order to adapt to their respective spoken varieties. In certain respects, Guangdong romanization resembles pinyin in its distinction of the alveolar initials z, c, s from the alveolo-palatal initials j, q, x and in its use of b, d, g to represent the unaspirated stop consonants . In addition, it makes use of the medial u before the rime rather than representing it as w in the initial when it follows g or k. Guangdong romanization makes use of diacritics to represent certain vowels. This includes the use of the circumflex, acute accent and diaeresis in the letters √™, √© and √º, respectively. In addition, it uses -b, -d, -g to represent the coda consonants rather than -p, -t, -k like other romanization schemes in order to be consistent with their use as unaspirated plosives in the initial. Tones are marked by superscript numbers rather than by diacritics. Cantonese The scheme for Cantonese is outlined in \\"The Cantonese Transliteration Scheme\\" (). It is referred to as the Canton Romanization on the LSHK character database. The system is not used in Hong Kong where romanization schemes such as Hong Kong Government, Yale, Cantonese Pinyin and Jyutping are popular, though it can be seen in works released in the People's Republic of China regarding Cantonese. Teochew The scheme for the Teochew dialect of Min Nan is outlined in \\"The Teochew Transliteration Scheme\\" (). This scheme (and another similar scheme which is based upon this scheme) is often referred to as Peng'im, which is the Teochew pronunciation of pinyin. This scheme is the romanization scheme currently described in the Teochew dialect article. Hakka The scheme for Hakka is outlined in \\"The Hakka Transliteration Scheme\\" (). The scheme describes the Meixian dialect, which is generally regarded as the de facto standard dialect of Hakka in mainland China. Hainanese The scheme for Hainanese is outlined in the \\"Hainanese Transliteration Scheme\\" (). The scheme describes the Wenchang dialect, which is generally regarded as the prestige dialect of Hainanese in mainland China, used in provincial broadcasting.

The company was named in honor of the Three Rings of the Elven-kings in Tolkien mythology. The company's first product was Yohoho! Puzzle Pirates, an skill-based open-world MMOG in which player is tasked with action puzzle games corresponding to tasks of piracy, crafting and carousing. The player joins a crew to sail with other players and participates in a player-driven trading economy. The company's second product, released December 1, 2006, was a western-themed Tactical Multi Player game named Bang! Howdy. Whirled, the company's third virtual world, was a player created content platform using Adobe Flash and html5. Whirled allowed creators to list virtual goods such as avatars, in-world toys or game content and earn real-world currency from the system. Whirled went into beta testing in 2008 and became unavailable in April 2017. Three Rings created a number of Flash games for Whirled, notably Corpse Craft which was later released on iPad. In 2010 the studio tested Facebook games including The Everything Game, a collectible card game. Spiral Knights was the company's fourth MMOG, launched in April 2011. Spiral Knights is an action adventure world where players cooperate to defeat the denizens of The Clockworks, a mysterious ever- changing maze. In 2011 the studio launched Doctor Who: Worlds in Time, in partnership with BBC Worldwide. Three Rings was an independent developer from its founding in 2001 until 2011 when it was acquired by SEGA of Japan. The company had been funded by the founders, revenues from Puzzle Pirates and other games, and investors including True Ventures. Following the acquisition the studio operated as a label within SEGA until March 2016, when SEGA reduced its San Francisco R&D; staff. Puzzle Pirates, Spiral Knights and other Three Rings games remain operational under the banner of Grey Havens. Games * Yohoho! Puzzle Pirates * Bang!

Only one large-scale action took place there: the Battle of Dakar (23‚Äì25 September 1940). The region remained under the control of Vichy France after the fall of France (25 June 1940) and until the Allied invasion of North Africa (8‚Äì16 November 1942). French Gabon, the only colony of French Equatorial Africa not to join Free France after the armistice, fell to invading Free French Forces from the neighbouring colonies after the Battle of Gabon (8‚Äì12 November 1940), further isolating West Africa. Unlike in metropolitan France, the French Colonial Troops in West Africa were not reduced after the 1940 armistice and the region was little interfered with by the Axis powers, providing a valuable addition to the forces of Free France after it had been liberated. Before this happened, there was some tension between the French and the neighbouring British colonies, particularly Sierra Leone, leading to the formation of the Freetown Defence Flight in June 1941, but no military incidents took place. Battle of Dakar Anti-British sentiment in Africa had run high after the French battleship Richelieu had been hit in the port of Dakar, Senegal, in French West Africa on July 10, 1940. In August, Free French General Charles de Gaulle suggested an overland campaign, landing at Conakry, French Guinea. He anticipated that popular support for the Free French movement would be built in a drive on Dakar. But de Gaulle's suggestion was overruled by British desires to move swiftly. On 18 September, three French light cruisers, the Georges Leygues, the Gloire, and the Montcalm were intercepted by Allied ships en route to Libreville. The intercepting Allied ships included the heavy cruiser HMAS Australia. The three French light cruisers were forced to retreat. Vichy resistance stiffened as a result of the attacks on the French ships. The Battle of Dakar (23 September to 25 September 1940) took place after Allied forces failed to persuade the Vichy French defenders of Dakar to allow them to peacefully enter the city. The Allied forces first tried to persuade the Vichy forces by means of propaganda. They then attempted to take Dakar by force of arms. Both attempts ended in defeat. Allied hopes of taking over French West Africa were dashed for the time being, leading to the less developed and economically important French Equatorial Africa to be the main Free French territory in the immediate aftermath of the Armistice.

He was a major selling Scandinavian act with over 5 million albums sold.https://fyens.dk/artikel/larsen-runder-fem-millioner Career Kim Larsen was born in Copenhagen. Inspired by The Beatles and rock and roll, he began as a songwriter and guitarist. In 1969 he met Franz Beckerlee and Wili J√∏nsson, and the three founded Gasolin' which, later joined by drummer S√∏ren Berlev, became one of the most successful Danish rock bands. The band dissolved in the late 1970s. In 1979, Larsen participated in the Danish stage of the Eurovision Song Contest with the song Ud i det bl√• (en: Out into the Blue). He came third out of 17 participants. The song was included on this album 231045-0637. Around 1980, Larsen moved to New York. He released two albums but was not successful in breaking through in America and returned to Denmark after a few years. Kim Larsen released a number of solo albums in the 1980s, topping the charts in 1983 with the album Midt om natten (en: In the Middle of the Night). The album more or less became a soundtrack for the movie by the same name based upon it. In 1983, Larsen founded the band Kim Larsen & Bellami and released four albums until 1992, when after a couple of different line-ups, the band broke up. He then released another solo album, Hvem kan sige nej til en engel (Who Can Say No To An Angel). In the mid 1990s he founded the band Kim Larsen & Kjukken which is based in Odense. By the end of 2017 Larsen was diagnosed with prostate cancer. This would end up impacting his tour with Kim Larsen & Kjukken who were scheduled for concerts throughout January, February and March 2018. In a Facebook post published to the band's official profile-page Larsen apologizes for the inconvenience and explains that he intends to be back playing by the start of the summer. Surrounded by his loved ones; Kim Larsen died of prostate cancer at his home in Odense on 30 September 2018. A week after his death a large memorial concert was held in Copenhagen with around 35,000 people attending, and major Danish musicians such as Magtens Korridorer, Love Shop, The Minds of 99, and Tim Christensen performing cover versions of Larsen's songs. Protest singer Larsen frequently voiced his opposition to established society and instead advocated the right to be different from the mainstream. The album and movie Midt om natten revolves around this subject ‚Äì in fact you can compare the movie action to the real Danish BZ movement BZ, Sorte Hest and also Freetown Christiania, located in Copenhagen. The same opposition is also shown by the album 231045-0637 ‚Äì the title is Kim Larsen's personal identification number which is strictly personal. Larsen was against the big database of every citizen, implied by this title. Kim Larsen was a heavy smoker, and he was critical of Danish anti-smoking laws. In August 2008, he paid for an advertising campaign which showed the text \\"Tillykke med rygeforbudet ‚Äì Gesundheit macht frei !!!\\". The first sentence means \\"Congratulations on the smoking ban\\" in Danish, and the second sentence means \\"health makes free\\" in German (this is a reference to the Nazi phrase Arbeit macht frei). Claiming that smoking bans are made not to protect smokers, but non-smokers, Kim Larsen made a connection between smoking bans and Nazism. The biography \\"Mine unge √•r - Kim Larsen\\" (My young years - Kim Larsen) by writer & journalist Jens Andersen together with Kim Larsen, was incomplete before his death and the book was finished without Kim Larsen.

This latter case is characteristic of the Guiana Highlands of northern South America. A Psamment has no distinct soil horizons, and must consist entirely of material of loamy sand or coarser in texture. In the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB), Psamments are known as Arenosols. Psamments cover 3.4% of the global land mass. They occur throughout the world, being especially abundant in the deserts of Africa and Australia and on the ancient landforms of eastern South America. Areas dominated by Psamments also occur in other humid regions, notably in Florida and Nebraska (the Sand Hills). Psamments typically have very low water-holding capacities because the sand in the soil is not graded so that sands of varying coarseness are constantly mixed right through the soil. Because most sands are highly siliceous, Psamments are also extremely low in all essential nutrients, most especially phosphorus and are highly acidic in all except very arid climates. Psamments formed as a result of glacial erosion (common in northern Europe) are typically of rather higher native fertility because of their youth, but are still much less fertile than most soils in the regions they are located in. The vegetation on Psamments varies enormously owing to the variety of climates, but in many cases is remarkably well-adapted to the climate, as with the Fynbos of the Cape region in South Africa‚Äîfamous for its remarkable biodiversity and the equally species-rich Kwongan of southwestern Western Australia. The campinas and kerangas are healthy forests typical of Psamments in South America and Borneo. Few Psamments are farmed, and where they are, the cost is high because of the expense of fertilization. They are always much less productive than other soils in the same region even when fertilized, and require careful management because the sand is very easily eroded. In USDA soil taxonomy, Psamments are divided into: * Cryopsamments: Psamments that have a cryic soil temperature regime * Quartzipsamments: other Psamments that have, in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction within the particle-size control section, a total of more than 90 percent (by weighted average) resistant minerals * Torripsamments: other Psamments that have an aridic (or torric) moisture regime * Ustipsamments: other Psamments that have an ustic moisture regime * Xeropsamments: other Psamments that have a xeric moisture regime * Udipsamments: other Psamments.

Background At the front, German resistance was falling away. Unprecedented numbers of prisoners were taken in the Battle of the Selle, and a new attack was quickly prepared. The French First Army and the British First, Third, and Fourth Armies were tasked with advancing from south of the Cond√© Canal along a front toward Maubeuge-Mons, threatening Namur. Together with the American forces breaking out of the forests of Argonne, this would, if successful, disrupt the German efforts to reform a shortened defensive line along the Meuse. At dawn on 4 November, 17 British and 11 French divisions headed the attack. The Tank Corps, its resources badly stretched, could provide only 37 tanks for support. Battle The first barrier to the northern attack was the -wide Sambre Canal and the flooded ground around it. It was there that the BEF had fought over four years earlier. The XIII and IX Corps reached the canal first. German guns quickly ranged the attackers, and bodies piled up before the temporary bridges were properly emplaced under heavy fire. The 1st and 32nd Divisions of IX Corps lost around 1,150 men in the crossing, including celebrated war poet Wilfred Owen. Even after the crossing the German forces defended in depth amid the small villages and fields, and it was not until midday that a by breach was secured. Lieutenant Colonel D.G. Johnson was awarded the Victoria Cross for leading the 2nd Battalion Sussex Regiment's crossing of the canal. Further north, IV and V Corps attacked into For√™t de Mormal. At Le Quesnoy, the Germans defence was haphazard: the 13th Royal Welsh Fusiliers hardly needed to use their guns, while the 9th Battalion of the 17th Division lost all but two officers and 226 of 583 soldiers. Despite this, the advance continued and the battle objectives were reached on the 4th or the following day. To the south, the French First Army attacked, capturing the communes of Guise (the Second Battle of Guise) and Origny-en-Thi√©rache (the Battle of Thi√©rache). This resulted in a bridgehead almost long being made, to a depth of .

He is portrayed by Andy Garc√≠a, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance. Vincent is the illegitimate son of Sonny Corleone and his mistress Lucy Mancini. He eventually succeeds his uncle Michael as head of the Corleone family. Retroactive continuity (\\"retcon\\") was employed to create the character's existence for The Godfather Part III, as it is evident from Mario Puzo's original 1969 novel that Lucy did not conceive a child with Sonny. Coppola has said that Vincent is an amalgamation of the five Corleone family males, having Vito's logical mind, Michael's duplicity, Fredo's vulnerability, Sonny's quick-temper and Tom Hagen's courage.  Fictional character biography  The Godfather Part III = In The Godfather, married Sonny Corleone and his sister's bridesmaid, Lucy Mancini were having an illicit affair; Vincent Mancini is the result of that union. Being illegitimate, as a youth he was not included in the Corleone family. When Michael Corleone offers him employment in one of the family's legitimate businesses, Vincent declines, preferring to work for Joey Zasa, who runs the remnants of the Corleone family's criminal empire in New York City. Vincent is eventually embroiled in a feud with Zasa when he senses that Zasa is trying to steal Michael's power. Michael tries to make peace between the two, but this fails; Zasa calls Vincent a bastard, and Vincent bites his ear. That night, Zasa sends two hitmen to kill Vincent, but Vincent kills them instead after forcing one of them to reveal who hired them. Vincent attempts to ingratiate himself with his uncle by protecting him from rival Mafia families, who are in league with Zasa and an unknown traitor within Michael's circle. Encouraged by his sister Connie, Michael takes Vincent under his wing and starts mentoring him. Michael likes Vincent's courage and wit, but notices that Vincent has inherited Sonny's hot-temper and worries he will suffer his father's fate. Vincent saves Michael from an assassination attempt orchestrated by Zasa at a Mafia summit in Atlantic City. That same night, Michael is hospitalized following a diabetic stroke. Believing Zasa will make another attempt on Michael's life, Vincent murders Zasa (with approval from Connie and Corleone assassin Al Neri). Michael is annoyed that Vincent used violence to deal with Zasa and did so without Michael's permission. When Vincent begins a relationship with Michael's daughter Mary, Michael fears that his nephew's growing involvement in the family's criminal activity will endanger her life; he is also concerned about Mary having a relationship with her first cousin. Michael confides in Vincent that he always felt responsible for him, and while they were different and argued, Michael never doubted Sonny's brotherly love and always knew Sonny would have done anything to protect Michael. Michael warns Vincent that Sonny's temper clouded his judgment, and Michael doesn't want Vincent to repeat his father's mistake. When Michael learns that his old friend Don Altobello is the traitor within the family, Michael has Vincent spy on him. Vincent learns that Licio Lucchesi, a powerful Italian politician and criminal underworld figure, was the mastermind of the assassination plot against his uncle, and employed Altobello, Zasa, and corrupt Vatican officials Frederick Keinszig and Archbishop Gilday to undermine Michael's criminal empire. Vincent wants permission to retaliate. Michael tacitly agrees, then formally retires as Don and names Vincent his successor, instructing him to call himself Don Vincent Corleone. Michael's guidance has made Vincent into a better man: tolerant, strong-willed, and acknowledging his position as the new Don. His first act is to order the murders of Lucchesi, Keinszig, and Gilday. Connie kills Altobello (her godfather) by poisoning him. In return for being made Don, Vincent agrees to end his relationship with Mary. That same night, Altobello's assassin Mosca accidentally kills Mary during an attempt on Michael's life. Angst-ridden, Vincent kills Mosca with a single gunshot. = Abandoned sequel = What follows in Vincent's story, according to author Mario Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola, is unknown. In The Godfather Part III DVD commentary, Coppola explains that both he and Puzo had envisioned a story depicting Vincent's reign as head of the Corleone family during the 1980s, still haunted by Mary's murder. Vincent, deviating from his predecessors' morals, would have entered the family into the drug trade, driving the Corleone clan back into corruption and eventual decline and ending with his being killed similarly to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar. This proposed film would have been titled either The Godfather Part IV or The Godfather: The Final Part. Flashbacks would include Vito Corleone's early days as Don, and the childhood days of Sonny, Fredo, Michael, and Connie Corleone, when they discover the precise nature of their father's business. The film would have portrayed the early days of Tom Hagen, Luca Brasi, and Johnny Fontane, and Vito's first meeting with Hyman Roth. According to Coppola, Puzo had composed a rough draft alternating between Vincent's reign as boss and the \\"Happy Years\\" of 1926‚Äì1939; passages from the original novel not previously incorporated into the movie storylines. Leonardo DiCaprio, Luis Guzm√°n, Ray Liotta, and Garc√≠a himself all expressed interest in the film. However, this project has lain dormant since Puzo's death in 1999.

She is the daughter of Michael Corleone and Kay Adams and sister of Anthony Vito Corleone. The Godfather Part II Mary first appears in The Godfather Part II as the youngest child of Michael and Kay. She is a young child (aged about 4 or 5) in the late 1950s. Like Anthony, she does not have a significant role or story arc in the film. The Godfather Part III Mary is one of the pivotal characters of Godfather Part III, set in 1979‚Äì80. Her father's favorite, she is sheltered from the violent world of the Corleone crime family. She falls in love with her cousin, Vincent Mancini, Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son. While the family is traveling in Sicily, Michael tells Mary he disapproves of the romance, believing that Vincent's growing involvement in the \\"family business\\" puts her life in danger. He fears that Mary could suffer the same fate as his first wife, Apollonia, who was killed by a car bomb intended for him 30 years earlier. Toward the end of the film, Michael names Vincent as his successor, on condition that he break off his relationship with Mary. After her brother's debut concert, the assassin Mosca tries to kill Michael. One bullet grazes Michael's shoulder, but the other accidentally hits Mary in the torso, fatally wounding her. Michael is devastated by Mary's death, and screams in torment while cradling her dead body. =Casting= Sofia Coppola, the daughter of director Francis Ford Coppola, was cast in the role after the original choice, Winona Ryder, discontinued her involvement with the film due to nervous exhaustion. It has been suggested that the situation further damaged Francis Ford Coppola's career and ruined Sofia's before it had even begun. Coppola has said that she never really wanted to act, and only appeared in the film as a favor to her father. After shooting, she confirmed that she did not want to go into acting. It has also been suggested that Sofia's role in the film may have contributed to its box office performance, which started strongly and then went into decline. Coppola has said that her father based a lot of her character on her while writing the script, before she was even cast into the role. Sofia had herself worried that she had only been given the role because she was the director's daughter, and the role placed a strain on her during the time of shooting that her mother observed in a series of diaries she wrote for Vogue during the filming. After she was critically panned for her performance in The Godfather Part III, for which she won Worst Supporting Actress and Worst New Star at the 1990 Golden Raspberry Awards, Coppola ended her acting career, although she appeared in the independent film Inside Monkey Zetterland (1992), as well as in the backgrounds of films by her friends and family: for example, she appeared as Sach√©, one of Queen Padm√© Amidala's five handmaidens in George Lucas' Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace (1999). Coppola has since been quoted as saying that she was not hurt by the criticism from her role in The Godfather Part III, because she never especially wanted an acting career. Sequel novels Mary appears as a minor character in Mark Winegardner's sequel novels The Godfather Returns and The Godfather's Revenge, although in the original novel, Michael's second child is a boy.

The Autococker is a closed-bolt semiautomatic paintball marker manufactured by Worr Game Products (WGP). It was one of the first paintball markers to be designed specifically for the sport, and has long been known throughout the paintball community for its popularity and customizability as well as its complexity. It is commonly believed that the closed-bolt design of the marker makes it inherently more accurate than its open-bolt counterparts, though this is disputed (see Accuracy, below). Once a common sight at professional paintball tournaments (especially in the early- to mid-1990s),Withstanding the Test of Time , Mohammed Alo, June 2002, The Paintball Times its popularity has since waned with the rise in popularity of electropneumatic markers. History A 1991 WGP Sniper II Serial Number #3810. The precursor to the Autococker. A 2003 WGP Prostock vertical feed Autococker with slider frame and a pump kit. In late 1986, Bud Orr created the original Sniper pump marker by carving the works of a standard Sheridan PGP into an aluminum block that would accept a longer barrel. The Sniper was operated in a manner similar to pump-action shotguns in that it had to be manually recocked after each shot to load the next round. In 1987, Orr founded Worr Game Products to sell the products he was developing, and by 1988 he was running the business full-time. In order to stay competitive with the rising popularity of semiautomatic markers in the late 1980s, Orr added a pneumatic system onto the Sniper. The pneumatics automatically re-cocked the marker after each shot, and in 1989 the Autococker was born.Autococker Tech Page - Cocker History at Ultra Twisted Paintball There is a lot of controversy as to whether the design was stolen from Glenn Palmer (who has repeatedly and publicly made and defended this claim and has given a detailed accounting of the circumstances) or was actually Bud's innovation. In the early 1990s the Autococker quickly rose to become one of the most popular markers used by top professional teams, used by such teams as Bob Long's original Ironmen. Although heavily criticized for reliability and a number of design defects,An In Depth Review of the Worr Games Products Autococker it proved to be an easy platform to work off and aftermarket parts soon appeared shortly after its inception. One of the most fundamental and important upgrades was the Palmer \\"Rock\\" low pressure regulator (LPR) to replace the troublesome stock LPR. With a variety of options appearing for parts, Belsales in the UK became the first company to build WGP-certified aftermarket cockers, called \\"Evolution\\" in 1993. Throughout the remainder of the 1990s, dozens of shops ranging from large notables such as Dave Youngblood Enterprises (Dye), Shocktech, Planet Eclipse, Belsales and FreeFlow down to small one man pro-shop operations made a business of servicing and customizing Autocockers with price tags of nearly $2000 for high-end models. A combination of performance, upgradeability and cosmetic options made it one of the top tournament markers of the 90's. Only the Automag rivaled it in popularity until electronic markers appeared. Indeed, the autococker was so ubiquitous that its barrel threading became one of the most commonly used standards on high-end markers (akin to how firearm cartridge sizes are often named for the first popular gun model or manufacturer to use them). To this day, most high-end markers, and many entry- level as well, accept barrels with \\"autococker threads\\". By the turn of the century, with the advent and increased popularity of electropneumatics, it no longer became profitable for specialized shops to produce custom autocockers, and they slowly began to disappear. Though the introduction of partial- electropneumatic conversion kits in the early 2000s by companies like Planet Eclipse extended the autocockers' popularity by a few more years, the availability of fully electropneumatic markers that required less work to maintain caused the autococker to lose favor with tournament teams, and eventually, casual players as well.Has Paintball Technology Reached a Plateau? , Mohammed S. Alo, April 2004, The Paintball Times Newer Autocockers with integrated, solenoid-controlled pneumatics remain available, boasting lesser maintenance and tuning. \\"Classic\\" Autococker models retain some popularity with recreational players, some of whom \\"revert\\" the design back to the pump- action \\"Sniper\\" concept for use in pump play. Operation The Autococker is essentially a pump marker with an automated pumping mechanism. It is a closed- bolt design, like all pump markers, and its operation can be broken down into two discrete phases, or cycles: 1) The firing cycle ‚Äì The process that releases the gas that fires a paintball out of the marker is fairly simple compared to the re-cocking cycle. At rest, the bolt sits forward, closing the chamber (hence, closed-bolt). This prevents more paintballs from entering. A pull of the trigger drops the sear, which in turn releases the hammer. A spring propels the hammer forward into the valve, which causes the valve to release a burst of gas upward into the bolt. The bolt redirects the gas behind the paintball, propelling it out the barrel. 2) The re-cocking cycle ‚Äì Once the paintball is fired, three things must happen in order to return the marker to a \\"ready\\" state: 1) the hammer must be pulled back so that it re-engages the sear and re-compresses the spring, 2) the bolt must be pulled back so that another paintball can fall from the feed tube into the breech, and 3) the bolt must be pushed forward after the paintball is loaded to close the breech. The Autococker back block On both the Sniper and the Autococker, a back block performs all three of these functions. The bolt is attached to the block, while a cocking rod (which is attached to the hammer and designed to catch on the block) passes through it. When the block moves backward, it pulls the bolt back, allowing a paintball to drop into the breech. The backward movement simultaneously pulls the cocking rod back, causing the hammer to also be pulled back until it re-engages the sear. When the block moves forward, it pushes the bolt (and the paintball) forward, closing the breech. The cocking rod stays pulled back, with the hammer ready to fire. On both the Sniper and Autococker, a pump rod runs from the front of the marker to the back block and serves as the means by which the back block moves forward and back. On the Sniper (and converted Autocockers), a pump handle is located on the front of the marker and attaches to the pump rod. After the player has pulled the trigger to fire a paintball, he/she then pulls back on the pump arm, pushing the back block rearward. This opens the bolt, allowing the next ball to be fed into the breech, and simultaneously pulls the hammer back until it is caught by the sear. =The front block= In the Autococker, a pneumatic system replaces the pump handle to automatically re-cock the marker (hence the name, \\"auto cocker\\"). The pneumatics are composed of three components: the low pressure regulator (LPR), the 3-way valve, and the ram. All three are grouped together at the front of the marker on what is known as the front block. The Autococker front block * The LPR is tapped into a channel inside the marker body through which air is routed to the bolt. Some of the gas used to fire the paintball is thus re-routed to the LPR. The LPR lowers the pressure to level appropriate for the pneumatic system (the pneumatics typically operate at < 100 PSI, versus a typical operating pressure of 400 PSI for the rest of the marker), before passing it on to the 4-way. * The second component is the 4-way valve, known simply as a 4-way. The valve is commonly known as a 3-way valve because it has 3 visible ports, but this is technically incorrect.https://web.archive.org/web/20040623030336/http://www.northarc.com/~tinker/xway.html It is linked to the trigger via a short timing rod and activated when the trigger is pulled. The 4-way features three barbs on top, two of which are connected via small hoses to either end of the ram, and one of which is connected to the LPR. Gas from the LPR enters the 4-way through the center barb. Inside the 4-way is a small sliding rod (or \\"spool\\") with 2 or 3 o-rings forming flow chambers that link the center barb to one or the other of the outer barbs depending on its position. No more than two barbs are linked at any given time. * The third component is the ram. The ram is connected to the pump rod and serves as the active pumping mechanism. It features two barbs, one near the front and one at the back, through which gas enters from the 4-way. O-rings inside the ram create compartments inside so that depending on whether gas enters the front or the back, the ram will either extend or retract. The end through which gas enters the ram depends on which barb in the 4-way is linked with the center barb. Timing The re-cocking cycle as described above is understandably complex, involving many independent components that must be synchronized in order for the marker to function properly. The process of synchronizing these components is known as timing.OtterSC's Custom Cockers, AutoCocker Timing and Troubleshooting, 2004 Timing is a process unique to Autocockers, and viewed by non-owners as particularly onerous. Experienced Autococker owners claim however that with enough practice, timing becomes as simple and routine as the upkeep required of any other paintball marker.Endless Paintball - Timing Tutorial, 2005 Most Autocockers are timed at the factory, and only need to be retimed if some of the timing components (such as the hammer, 3-way, timing rod, etc.) are replaced. Players experienced in both working on and operating Autocockers prefer a more careful timing process called suction, or vacuum timing. The recocking cycle is carefully moved closer towards the firing point, until the interaction between the ball exiting the barrel and the bolt recocking creates a vacuum in the breech. This causes the marker to effectively \\"suck\\" a paintball into the chamber. Accuracy A common belief is that the closed- bolt design of Autocockers makes them inherently more accurate than open-bolt markers.Sniper II - AutoCocker, Martin Heffron, WARPIG This argument is premised on the fact that the bolt's mass does not move forward when the trigger is pulled, (as it does in open-bolt designs) since the ball is already \\"chambered\\" in the breech when the firing cycle is initiated. Proponents suggest that the absence of an oscillating mass during the firing cycle makes the autococker a more stable firing platform, which increases accuracy. Tests have indicated however, that where there is a good paint-to-barrel match, the design of the marker is irrelevant.Where's the Bolt? at WARPIG Open-bolt markers with a good paint-to-barrel match have proven to be just as accurate as the Autococker. These tests, however, did not measure the stability of the shooting platform, which is the main reason many believe Autocockers to be accurate. They instead used a fixed mounting point which artificially equalizes the stability of both marker tested. Additionally, these test were performed with a single marker modified to act like both and open or closed bolt paintball marker. This modification along with the poor quality of the modified marker leads to inherently inaccurate shots for both versions. The belief that Autocockers are more accurate due to their design is partially due to the confounding fact that the Autococker requires a good paint-to-barrel match. In open-bolt markers, the breech is open during the firing phase, since the bolt is in a \\"back\\" position. Thus, a rubber detent keeps the \\"chambered\\" ball from rolling out of the barrel before the marker is fired. The closed- bolt design of the marker means that paintballs are held in the chamber, beyond the breech where the detent is located. The only thing keeping the paintball from rolling out the barrel is a good paint-to-barrel match. Autococker owners unaware of this fact tend to notice that paintballs roll out of the barrel when the end is pointed downward. Criticisms Reliability: Due to their large number of moving parts, Autocockers are popular with tinkerers. Since even seemingly unimportant aspects of the marker, such as how far the back block is screwed onto the pushrod, can affect Autococker performance, minor tinkering with the marker can compound over time and lead to failure. It is not uncommon for an inexperienced owner to try to fix an Autococker that is not broken, frequently with disastrous results. As a result, rumors of Autocockers being unreliable have circulated the internet for years. The reality however, is that Autocockers are extremely reliable once set up properly. Experienced owners that understand how each of the parts in the marker interact are consistently able to modify and upgrade the marker without causing problems. Since new Autocockers are designed to work \\"out of the box,\\" new owners are usually advised to not tinker with anything until they fully understand how the marker works. Gas Efficiency: Although the Autococker operates at lower pressures than many of its contemporaries, such as the Kingman Spyder and Automag, the forces and pressures at play in the firing and recocking mechanisms must be balanced for the greatest effectiveness at the desired shot velocity, something that does not have to be done (at least to this degree) in any other marker. This is generally known as \\"sweet-spotting\\" the marker, or more specifically the marker's high-pressure regulator or HPR. If the HPR is set at too low a pressure, the marker will get insufficient pressure to fire the ball at the desired velocity or even to operate. If set too high, the pressure against the back of the valve will work against the hammer opening the valve to fire the paintball and again reduce velocity. Either way, the consistency of shots and the gas efficiency of the marker are reduced, and a common complaint among inexperienced Autococker users is that they do not get many shots from a full tank of air or CO2. Balancing the marker requires firing several shots over a chronograph to find the \\"sweet spot\\" of the HPR (the point at which the velocity is highest, then adjusting the hammer spring tension to increase or decrease velocity, and re- adjusting the HPR to find the new sweet spot, until the marker is firing at field limits with the HPR at or near its sweet spot. The LPR controlling the pneumatics must then be adjusted to use the least amount of pressure necessary to move the back block fully rearward. This process requires access to a shooting range with a chronograph, and significant time, air, paint and patience, which many casual players do not possess. Slow rate of fire: In an era where electropneumatic markers are prized for their high rate of fire in both tournament and recreational play, the slower mechanical operation of the Autococker (at least in entry-level models) is looked upon with some disdain. The first production E-cocker conversion was the PMS mark 3 system in the late 90s, which met with minimal success but paved the way for offerings by Sandridge (fully electronic and one of the first electro's to use eye technology) and the centerflag Uprising (partial conversion). Next generation frames from Racegun and Eclipse (with multiple fire modes, fully electronic sear and pneumatics) were the first frames to find broad use and the Eclipse E-Blade became the standard for electro-cockers but was discontinued in 2006. WGP's own electropneumatic system, based on technology licensed from Planet Eclipse, is now standard on many of their new Autococker models. Short- Stroking: On mechanical Autocockers, the trigger both fires the marker (by releasing the sear) and re-cocks it (by pulling the timing rod and activating the 3-way). The pull of the trigger accomplishes first one, then the other, in a precisely timed operation, making it necessary for the player to fully pull and release the trigger each time. Only partially pulling the trigger, known colloquially as \\"short-stroking\\", will alter the duration of time the pneumatics are actively operating the recocking mechanism, or may eliminate the re-cocking cycle altogether. Short-stroking can thus cause many malfunctions related to one or more steps of the recocking process not being performed. For instance, if the back block does not move fully rearward, the hammer may not be caught by the sear, and will be released into the pin valve immediately upon the back block moving forward again. If the back block is not kept rearward long enough for a paintball to drop fully into the chamber, a \\"dry fire\\" or a \\"ball chop\\" may occur, the latter being extremely frustrating as it drastically affects accuracy of future shots until the barrel, breech and bolt are cleaned. The need for a full trigger pull on mechanical Autocockers also results in a slower rate of fire. Sear Trip: Even with an electronic trigger, the Autococker still relies on a hammer and spring valve for firing. The electronic trigger controls the recocking pneumatics, and a sear solenoid. Thus, even electronic Autocockers have an amount of recoil and rate of fire some find unacceptable for serious play (though Autocockers are still seen in serious tournament play). In early 2006, the first fully electronic (valve and recock) electronic Autocockers were seen, made using the \\"mQ valve\\" (named after their inventor Mike Quinn).MQ Valve Review , Andrew C. Syren, December 12, 2005, The Paintball Times The valve only had a limited release cycle however, and became tied up in production and legal issues. A lack of steady supply of mQ valves caused prices to skyrocket on eBay, even for used or damaged ones. In mid-2007, the original creators announced that they had resolved the production issues and are now making new \\"mQ2 valves,\\" which are mQ valves redesigned for greater reliability, flow, and consistency. Variants WGP has produced several of its own \\"higher-end\\" versions of its base Autococker: * STO (\\"Special Tournament Operations\\") * Vertebrae * Orracle * Black Magic (two versions) * Worrlock * Superstock * Karnivor * Jeff Orr Signature Series * Prostock * Outkast * Nightkast (outkast marker with factory e-blade) * Trilogy series =Trilogy autococker= After its acquisition by K2 in 2004, WGP decided to produce Autocockers that could compete with entry- level markers like Kingman's Spyder and Smart Parts' Ion. However, the popular perception of Autocockers as \\"complex\\" and \\"difficult to maintain\\" was a serious hurdle to WGP's ability to market it to beginner players. The decision was made to \\"simplify\\" the functions of the Autococker, and the result was the Trilogy line. On Trilogy Autocockers, the front block is removed, and the pneumatics are attached directly on to the body. The 4-way valve is also integrated into the body and cannot be replaced with third-party upgrades. This lack of the front block allows them to be produced at lower cost while decreasing complexity. However, upgrades to the marker can be a bit more difficult because of this. For example, an adapter is needed to allow the use of standard LPR's, and specialized pump kits are required to make a Trilogy a pump gun. Within the Trilogy Autococker line, there are three models, the Pro, Competition, and Sport. Variations such as the Trilogy Tactical have the same basic mechanical components; changes are mostly cosmetic. The Trilogy Pro and Tactical models are available with an electronic frame called Trilogy Select Fire. This is different from the separately available WorrFrame Select Fire, such as can be found on the 2005 Black Magic model. The Trilogy Select Fire, uses the 4-way valve integrated into the body of the gun rather than an electronic solenoid like other electronic frames. Though most markers in the Trilogy line are mechanical, it is possible to add an electronic trigger frame, which bypasses elements like the integrated 3-way. Later released Eclipse Blade 2 kits had an adapter for this purpose. The Trilogy can also be converted to manual pump-action, similar to the original Sniper line, which makes the integrated 4-way irrelevant.

History In 1910, the Buckeye Land and Development Co., an Ohio-based company established its presence in Colorado, and provided a name for the widespread community. The Buckeye Ranch occupied several sections. Buckeye trees, not typically seen in Colorado, grow in front of its former headquarters. In the 1800s, the Bristol-Minor stop on the Overland Trail stage coach line occupied buildings which later became part of the Buckeye Ranch. In 1924, a Union Pacific line ran from Buckeye to Fort Collins for the purpose of shipping sheep and other livestock to stockyards in Denver. In the early 20th century, in addition to the railroad facilities, the community had a gas station and a school; the latter opened in 1925. The railroad line was abandoned in 1965, and at that time the tracks, bunkhouse and corrals were dismantled and removed. The railroad depot was relocated further south to its present location on County Road 17 and has been converted to a residence. In 1926, the Buckeye School opened to students through 8th grade. A stable was located on the school grounds for the use of the students who arrived on horseback. The two teachers were housed in the basement apartment instead of living with a host family; the latter arrangement was more common in rural Larimer County.Among These Hills, A History of Livermore, Colorado, The Livermore Woman's Club, 2nd ed, rev, 2009 In 1960, during a consolidation period by Poudre R-1 School District, the Buckeye School was closed and local students were bused south to the Waverly School.National Register of Historic Places, U.S. Department of the Interior National Park Service, Sec.7, p.4 After the closure, the District continued to allow community members to use the facilities as long as the building was maintained. In 1967, 26 local families and the 4-H Buckeye Buck-N-Ears Club organized and eventually purchased the property, renaming it the Buckeye Community Club. In June 2008, the Buckeye School was placed on the National Register of Historic Places and the Colorado State Register of Historic Properties. The Civilian Conservation Corps established camp No. 809 in 1935, on the Munroe Ranch. In operation until 1940, academic and vocational classes were offered to the young men, ages 17 to 23, who enrolled in the work program. Soil conversation and erosion control were of primary importance for the in the Buckeye and Boxelder drainage projects. The men planted 240,000 trees while the camp was active. The camp was sited near a source of alabaster, which was turned into various household and decorative items.North Forty News, March 1998, p. 11 Irrigation The North Poudre Irrigation Company supplies water to local agricultural operations through the Park Creek Reservoir, located on CR 80. Ranching and Conservation After the Homestead Act was enacted in 1862, Martin Calloway became one of the first homesteaders of Buckeye, settling the area which would later become the Munroe Ranch. With his wife, Calloway improved his acreage; he was the first to irrigate from Boxelder Creek. The hay was cut and hauled by oxen to Cheyenne, approximately away, where he traded it for household necessities. By the 1870s his ranch had become profitable through the addition of sheep. The ranch was sold to the Greenacre brothers in 1909. In 1917 Ida and Clarence Munroe purchased the land from the Greenacres, which in 1914 was approximately . Government permits had recently been made available to graze livestock on federal land, which allowed ranchers to move cattle in the spring into the mountains, returning the herds in the fall to overwinter on the plains. In 1921, the Munroes had expanded their operation to include 3,200 head of sheep, and profits were used to purchase other smaller ranches. An acre could be purchased for as little as $2.50. By the 1940s, the Munroe ranch was . In 1960, their son Edward Munroe, drove the last herd of sheep down Poudre Canyon from summer grazing on the Mummy Range. The ranch later became known as the Red Mountain Ranch, and in 2004, the ranch was part of acquired by Larimer County and converted to open space as part of the Laramie Foothills Open Lands 2001 Master Plan. The open space is accessible to the public from March through December. To the west lies the Roberts Ranch, founded in 1874 also under the Homestead Act. The ranch, which occupies , is in various conservation easements, but is not accessible to the public. The Roberts family, which has owned the property continuously since the land grant, continues a cow/calf operation. The Conservation easements protect numerous archeological sites and natural resources from development. By 2006, other area ranchers had shielded an additional from development by partnering with the Larimer County Open Lands program and Legacy Land trust.Fort Collins Coloradoan, January 1, 2006 References Category:Unincorporated communities in Larimer County, Colorado Category:Unincorporated communities in Colorado ","title":"Buckeye, Colorado"},{"id":"1626099","text":"Bulimba Creek, originally known as Doboy Creek or Doughboy Creek, ia a perennial stream that is a tributary of the Brisbane River, located in suburban Brisbane in the South East region of Queensland, Australia. Course and features The Bulimba Creek catchment has it sources in the low plateaus and marshy parts of the suburbs of and Runcorn (west catchment) and Kuraby (east catchment) in the south of Brisbane. It then flows in a northerly direction through the suburbs of Mansfield, Mackenzie, Carindale, Murarrie and Lytton, before meeting the Brisbane River via the Aquarium Passage along the Lytton Reach. The creek has six tributaries: Mimosa Creek, Spring Creek, Salvin Creek, Phillips Creek, Tingalpa Creek and Lindum Creek. There are also a number of significant wetlands systems in the catchment, including Runcorn Wetlands in the upper catchment and Numgubbah, Tingalpa, Doboy and Lindum Wetlands in the lower catchment. The creek is currently impacted primarily by urban and industrial development. In the past the creek corridor was extensively cleared for cropping and then grazing in the early part of the last century with some remnant vegetation remaining. In some areas the reduction in rural industries has allowed riparian vegetation to regrow. The catchment has a nature reserve network, mainly of protected hills, including Karawatha Forest, Toohey Forest Conservation Park and Mt Gravatt Outlook, Belmont Hills, Whites Hill and Pine Mountain, Seven Hills and Oates Hill. The creek feeds the Runcorn Water Reserve, Tingalpa Wetlands, Nungubba Swamp, Dairy Swamp, Lyndon Wetlands, Iona Wetlands, The Bulimba Creek Oxbow and Minnippi Parklands. Fauna and floraIntroduced= The invasive fish species tilapia is present in the waterway. The creek suffers from the introduction of the waterway weed called salvinia first identified in the catchment in 1953. =Threatened= Many of the nature reserves have threatened species. For example, is Whites Hill the powerful owl, grey-headed flying fox, velvet gecko and grey goshawk are all threatened. Flora at risk includes Shirley's tuckeroo and Macadamia integrifolia. Karawatha Forest is the reserve with the highest number of species and has five different species of glider possums. It also has a fauna overpass constructed over the four lane road, along with underpasses, rope ladders and exclusion funnelling fencing. The project was undertaken by The Griffith University Fauna Unit and Dr Darryl Jones. History The indigenous clans of the Yuggera and Turrbal people lived in or traversed parts of the Bulimba Creek catchment for at least twenty thousand years. It is believed that a locality on the creek was called boolimbah, meaning a place of the magpie lark and thought to refer specifically to what is now known as . The first recorded use of the name Bulimba Creek occurred in 1888. Belmont in 1931. In the late 1860s the Walrus, a large paddle steamer built at Cleveland, was converted to Australia's first floating distillery with the addition of a steam driven sugar mill on board. The Walrus navigated the lower reaches of Bulimba Creek and the Brisbane River before servicing areas along the Nerang, Albert and the Logan Rivers to the south. In order to provide a straighter deeper channel in the lower reaches Brisbane River, it was decided in 1889 to relocate the mouths of creeks and eliminate all of islands by a combination of removal by dredging and incorporation as part of the river bank. In the case of Doughboy Creek (now Bulimba Creek) and Gibson Island, it was decided to relocate the creek mouth then at approximately (to the west of Gibson Island) to the eastern end of Gibson Island (its current mouth) by closing the original mouth with a training wall diverting the flow of the creek into Aquarium Passage () which separated Gibson Island from the southern bank of the Brisbane River. The Doughboy training wall was built from 1900 to June 1902 and was long. As a result of the training wall, an isthmus (approximately wide as at 2020) formed at the original mouth of the creek permanently connecting Gibson Island to Murarrie. In August 2008 the Bulimba Creek valley was polluted by a vast oil leak from the 1964-laid Santos-owned to Brisbane pipeline adjacent to Bulimba Creek at Carindale, requiring the removal of hundreds of truckloads of contaminated soil from the suburb's recreation reserve. Bulimba Creek Catchment Coordinating Committee The Bulimba Creek Catchment Coordinating Committee is associated with the Landcare Group and is run by volunteers. Formed in 1997 and incorporated in 1999, it supports smaller groups and individuals involved in Bushcare, Catchment Care, Nature conservation and environmental education and awareness. Known as the B4C, the group is involved in protecting and rehabilitating waterways, corridors, remnant bushlands and wetlands. It was the first urban Queensland group to win a State Landcare award in 2000. In 2005 the B4C won the prestigious Thiess National Riverprize. Recent successes in protecting the environment by the B4C include securing the Weekes Road, Carindale Bushlands and Oates Hill Reserve from the Queensland Government, saving the Wishart Bushlands from development, saving the Bulimba Creek Oxbow and negotiating a major rehabilitation project to restore this saline wetland. The B4C has its own foundation \\"the Bulimba Creek Environment Fund\\", which provides small grants to members of the community to get involved in environmental issues, education and training. B4C has its own catchment centre and community nursery. It is in the process of developing a site together with its corporate partner, Powerlink, into a sustainability centre, inclusive of a sustainable home (office),community nursery, with waterwise gardens and through the use of permaculture methods and sustainable technologies.

On systems with a pagefile, it may be thought of as the maximum potential pagefile usage. On systems with no pagefile, it is still counted, but all such virtual address space must remain in physical memory (RAM) at all times (once it is accessed).  Overview  The Windows Task Manager utility for Windows XP and Server 2003, in its Performance tab, shows three counters related to commit charge: * Total is the amount of pagefile-backed virtual address space in use, i.e., the current commit charge. This is composed of main memory (RAM) and disk (pagefiles). The corresponding performance counter is called \\"Committed Bytes\\". * Limit is the maximum possible value for Total; it is the sum of the current pagefile size plus the physical memory available for pageable contents (this excludes RAM that is assigned to non-pageable areas). The corresponding performance counter is called \\"Commit Limit\\". * Peak is the highest amount that the total commit charge has reached since the operating system was last started. The program Process Explorer reports the same set of values, labeling the Total as Current, and additionally providing percentages of Peak and Current towards the Limit value. The commit charge increases when any program is opened and used, and goes down when a program is closed. It will also change when already-running programs allocate or free private virtual memory; for example, with the VirtualAlloc and VirtualFree APIs. In the Task Manager utility under Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, the graphical displays labeled as \\"PF usage\\" and \\"Page File Usage History,\\" despite their labels, reflect not the pagefile contents but the total (or current) commit charge. The height of the graph area corresponds to the commit limit. These do not show how much has actually been written to the pagefile, but only the maximum potential pagefile usage: The amount of pagefile that would be used if all current contents of RAM had to be removed. In Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0, these same displays are labeled \\"Mem usage\\" but again actually show the commit charge and commit limit. Similar displays in the Task Manager of Windows Vista and later have been changed to reflect usage of physical memory. In Task Manager's \\"Processes\\" display, each process's contribution to the \\"total commit charge\\" is shown in the \\"VM size\\" column in Windows XP and Server 2003. The same value is labeled \\"Commit size\\" in Windows Vista and later. The total commit charge will always be larger than the sum of these values, as the total includes system-wide allocations such as the paged pool. In the same display, the \\"Mem Usage\\" column in Windows XP and Server 2003, or the \\"Working Set (Memory)\\" column in Windows Vista and later, shows each process's current working set. This is a count of physical memory (RAM) rather than virtual address space. It represents the subset of the process's virtual address space that is valid, meaning that it can be referenced without incurring a page fault. The commit charge for each process does not include other major contributions to the process's virtual address space, such as mapped files. For this reason, the process's working set (the portion of its address space that can be referenced without incurring a page fault) may be larger than its contribution to total commit charge, and the total commit charge is not inclusive of the total memory (physical or virtual) actually in use. The commit limit may be increased by either creating additional pagefiles or, if pagefile expansion is enabled, by expanding an existing one. The operating system will expand the pagefile automatically, if possible, when the total commit charge approaches the limit. In such an event a popup window will be displayed stating that \\"The system is running low on virtual memory.\\" If the system ever runs completely out of commit charge (that is, if the total reaches the limit), a popup window will be displayed stating that \\"The system is out of virtual memory,\\" and it may become extremely sluggish or even nonresponsive. Closing programs (if the user is still able to do so at this point) decreases the total commit charge and may thereby free up the system.

Greene played all 69 games at third base for the Clemson Tigers in his freshman season, all but one of them starts. His first collegiate home run was an inside-the-park home run which came at the UNLV/Coors Desert Classic on February 27. In his freshman year, Greene had 98 hits, setting the record for Clemson freshmen. He led the team in hits, multi-hit games (31), at-bats (274), and hit-by-pitches (11). His batting average for the season was .358. Greene was a unanimous selection to the All-Regional Team in the postseason. In his sophomore season, Greene started every one of the team's 69 games at third base. He led the team in batting average with runners in scoring position at .444. He was an All-ACC second team selection. (The first team selection was Georgia Tech's Mark Teixeira.) He was selected to the All-ACC Tournament team. After the 1999 and 2000 seasons, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Greene again started every game for the Clemson Tigers in his junior season, but this time he and erstwhile shortstop Jeff Baker switched positions. He set the school record in season fielding percentage at that position (.965), while also setting every hit-by-pitch record for the school (in an inning, 2; in a game, 3; in a season, 21; in a career, 47). He also led the team in doubles with 18. He was named the ACC Player of the Week during the last week of the season. Peter Gammons made a prediction in his pre-draft column on ESPN.com: \\"You won't find Clemson shortstop/third baseman Khalil Greene or Wake Forest center fielder Cory Sullivan on any top-100 list, but check back in five years from now and see if they aren't remarkably like Jeff Cirillo and Steve Finley. Greene and Sullivan are players.\\" Greene was drafted with the second pick of the fourteenth round (409th overall) by the Chicago Cubs, but did not sign. Greene's senior season was his most impressive: Collegiate Baseball named him National Player of the Year. The publication, along with Baseball America, selected him as a member of their All-America first teams. Baseball America also chose Greene for their National Midseason Player of the Year. He was the ACC's Player of the Year and was named to the All-ACC first team. Greene was named winner of the Dick Howser Trophy, the Rotary Smith Award, and the Golden Spikes Award at the end of the season. He hit an amazing .480 with 26 home runs and 30 doubles with a .557 on-base percentage and .888 slugging percentage (for an OPS of 1.445). He broke his own fielding record with a .967 mark. In only one of the team's 67 games did he not reach base via walk or hit. His last at-bat in Clemson's Doug Kingsmore Stadium was, fittingly, a home run. After Greene finished the season, having graduated with a bachelor's degree in sociology, he held school single-season records for total bases, extra-base hits, home runs, RBI, consecutive multi-hit games, and consecutive games with a home run. He still holds career school records in total bases and RBI. He holds the ACC single-season record for batting average and the ACC career records for doubles and hits. Greene also holds the NCAA record for doubles in a career. On June 22, 2002, Greene received a special resolution from the South Carolina General Assembly. He'd started 269 consecutive games.

He was created by director Paul Smith for the Walter Lantz studio in 1953, and developed further by Tex Avery in the two subsequent films following Smith's debut entry. The character soon became the second most popular Lantz/Universal character, behind Woody Woodpecker. Fifty Chilly Willy cartoons were produced between 1953 and 1972. Inspiration Chilly Willy was inspired by mystery writer Stuart Palmer, according to Scott MacGillivray's book Castle Films: A Hobbyist's Guide. Palmer used the Lantz studio as a background for his novel Cold Poison, in which the cartoon star was a penguin character, and Lantz adopted the penguin idea for the screen.Castle Films: A Hobbyist's Guide- Google Books (pg.108) The character Pablo the Penguin from the 1945 Disney film The Three Caballeros was the inspiration for Chilly Willy.Animation: A World History: Volume II: The Birth of a Style - The Three Markets-Google Books Attributes and common themes Chilly Willy appeared in 50 theatrical short subjects produced by Lantz from 1953 to 1972, most of which involve his attempts to stay warm, and often meeting opposition from a dog named Smedley (voiced by Daws Butler in his \\"Huckleberry Hound\\" voice). Smedley has a large mouth and sharp-pointed teeth (which he shows off when yawning), but is never shown viciously trying to bite Chilly or anyone else with them. There were times, however, when Chilly and Smedley got along, as they did in Vicious Viking and Fractured Friendship. However, Chilly never referred to Smedley by name. Most times that Chilly was in opposition with Smedley, it wound up with the two of them being friends at the end. Chilly was more of a nuisance to Smedley than an enemy, often showing up where Smedley is working, usually for some mean employer. Many times, the notion of a plot was extremely weak, appearing to be a random collection of loosely related gags as opposed to a coherent story. Two of Chilly's friends in the later cartoons were Maxie the Polar Bear (voiced by Daws Butler) and Gooney the \\"Gooney Bird\\" Albatross (voiced by Daws Butler impersonating Joe E. Brown). Maxie has appeared with Chilly more than Gooney has. There have been only two cartoons in which all three characters have appeared together: Gooney's Goofy Landings (where Chilly and Maxie try to perfect Gooney's landings) and Airlift a la Carte (where Chilly, Maxie, and Gooney go to the store owned by Smedley). In some episodes, Chilly Willy also deals with a hunter named Colonel Pot Shot (voiced by Daws Butler) whom Smedley has been shown to work for in some episodes. Pot Shot would give orders in a calm controlled voice, and then would explode in rage when he told Smedley what would happen should he fail in his objective. Also, two episodes had Chilly Willy outsmarting Wally Walrus when Chilly Willy comes across his fishing projects. Paul Smith directed the first Chilly Willy cartoon, simply titled Chilly Willy, in 1953. The initial version of Chilly Willy resembled Woody Woodpecker, except with flippers and black feathers, but he was redesigned in to his more familiar form in subsequent cartoons. Tex Avery revived the character for two of his shorts, I'm Cold (1954) and the Academy Award nominated The Legend of Rockabye Point (1955). After Avery left the studio, Alex Lovy assumed as director, starting by directing Hot and Cold Penguin. Chilly was mute in most of his 1950s cartoons and early 1960s cartoons, although he was voiced by Sara Berner in the initial entry. The next time he spoke was in Half-Baked Alaska in 1965, with Daws Butler providing Chilly's voice until the end of the series in a style similar to his Elroy Jetson characterization. The character always speaks in the comic book stories based on the character. Also in the comic book stories, Chilly had two nephews named Ping and Pong, similar to how Woody Woodpecker is uncle to Twins Knothead and Splinter. When the Lantz cartoons were packaged for television in 1957 as The Woody Woodpecker Show, Chilly Willy was a featured attraction on the show, and has remained such in all later versions of the Woody Woodpecker Show package. Other appearances In Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Chilly Willy is mentioned by Eddie's pantron Angelo. Chilly Willy is featured in The New Woody Woodpecker Show where he has no dialogue. Like the shorts, Chilly has gone up against Smedley. Later episodes introduce Sgt. Hogwash (voiced by Blake Clark) and Major Bull (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) who operate in an Antarctic military base that Chilly tends to trespass in.

The term often indicates that two superficially-different elements are the same linguistic unit at a deeper level, though more than two elements can be in complementary distribution with one another. In phonology Complementary distribution is the distribution of phones in their respective phonetic environments in which one phone never appears in the same phonetic context as the other. When two variants are in complementary distribution, one can predict when each will occur because one can simply look at the environment in which the allophone is occurring. Complementary distribution is commonly applied to phonology in which similar phones in complementary distribution are usually allophones of the same phoneme. For instance, in English, and are allophones of the phoneme because they occur in complementary distribution. always occurs when it is the syllable onset and followed by a stressed vowel (as in the word pin). occurs in all other situations (as in the word spin, or in sippin' in colloquial pronunciation, with flattened to ). There are cases of elements being in complementary distribution but not being considered allophones. For example, English and are in complementary distribution: occurs only at the beginning of a syllable and only at the end. However, because they have so little in common in phonetic terms, they are still considered separate phonemes.An Introduction to Language by Victoria Fromkin In morphology The concept of complementary distribution is applied in the analysis of word forms (morphology). Two different word forms (allomorphs) can actually be different \\"faces\\" of one and the same word (morpheme). An example is the English indefinite articles a and an. The usages an aardvark and a bear are grammatical, but the usages **a aardvark and **an bear are ungrammatical (as is marked with \\"**\\" in linguistics). :The form an is used before a word that begins with a vowel sound. :That can be notated as \\"__ V\\". :The form a is used before a word beginning with a consonant sound. :That can be notated as \\"__ C\\". :The \\"distribution\\" (usage according to environments) of the forms an and a is \\"complementary\\" because of three factors: :(1) an is used if a is not used; :(2) a is used if an is not used; :(3) both environments together cover every legitimate potential environment for the word. The forms an and a work together like a team and take care of every instance (environment) in which the English indefinite article is used, i.e. there are two different \\"forms\\" of the same \\"word\\" instead of two different words.

Callen\\" (biography). College Park, Maryland: American Institute of Physics, retrieved online February 23, 2019. He is considered one of the founders of the modern theory of irreversible thermodynamics, and is the author of the classic textbook Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics, published in two editions. During World War II, his services were invoked in the theoretical division of the Manhattan Project. Life and work A native of Philadelphia, Herbert Callen received his Bachelor of Science degree from Temple University. His graduate studies were interrupted by the Manhattan Project. He also worked on a U.S. Navy project concerning guided missiles (Project Bumblebee) at Princeton University in 1945. Callen subsequently completed his PhD in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1947. He was supervised by the physicist L√°szl√≥ Tisza. His doctoral dissertation concerns the Kelvin thermoelectric and thermomagnetic relations, and Onsager's reciprocal relations; it was titled On the Theory of Irreversible Processes. Upon receiving his degree, Callen spent a year at the MIT Laboratory for Insulation Research and developed his theory of electrical breakdown for insulators. In 1948, Callen joined the faculty of the Department of Physics at the University of Pennsylvania and became a professor in 1956. Specialists consider his most lasting contribution to physics to be the paper co-written with Theodore A. Welton presenting a proof of the fluctuation- dissipation theorem, an extremely general result describing how a system's response to perturbations relates to its behavior at equilibrium. This crucial result became the basis for the statistical theory of irreversible processes and explains how fluctuations dissipate energy into heat in general and the phenomenon of Nyquist noise in particular. Callen then pioneered the thermodynamic Green's functions for magnetism. With his students, he studied many-body problems involving spin operators. This led to the discovery of some useful methods of approximations. The first edition of his classic text Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics was published in 1960. In it, he presents a rigorous axiomatic treatment of thermodynamics in which the state functions are the fundamental entities and the processes are their differentials. The postulates concern the existence of thermal equilibrium, and the properties of entropy. From them, he derives the fundamentals of thermodynamics, found in the first eight chapters. The much revised second edition, published in 1985, became a highly cited reference in the literature and an enduring textbook. He was a successful teacher, noted for his ability to explain complicated phenomena in simple terms. He played a key role in the recruitment of promising solid-state physicists to the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1950s and continued to be active in the University's academic affairs till his retirement in 1985. He was the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship for the academic year 1972-1973. In 1984, Callen received the Elliott Cresson Medal from the Franklin Institute. He retired in 1985. He was made a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1990. After battling Alzheimer's disease for eleven years, Herbert Callen died in the Philadelphia suburb of Merion in 1993. He was 73 years old. He was survived by his wife, Sara Smith, and their two children, Jed and Jill.

It is named for Tom Moreland, a former commissioner of the Georgia Department of Transportation from 1975 to 1987. I-85 is a major traffic corridor from the northeastern suburbs of Atlanta in the Gwinnett County area into downtown Atlanta. I-285 is a beltway around Atlanta. In the northern I-285 corridor, in the area from I-85 counterclockwise to I-75, there has been a large amount of development of office space. Spaghetti Junction was designed to remove choke points and reduce congestion in the I-85 and I-285 interchange, which had been a cloverleaf. Type of interchange The interchange is a stack interchange. Because of a northeast-to-southwest ramp that passes over the fourth level of the interchange, Spaghetti Junction is a five-level stack interchange, not a traditional four-level stack. It contains additional ramps to accommodate traffic on four nearby side roads: Buford Highway/US 23, Chamblee-Tucker Road, Pleasantdale Road, and Northcrest Road. The interchange currently handles approximately 300,000 vehicles each day. It has 14 bridges, the highest rising 90 feet (27 m), running from Northcrest Road to I-85 South. The newer interchange replaced an older cloverleaf interchange dating back to 1958 and was constructed between 1983 and 1987 as part of the Freeing the Freeways program to relieve congestion on Atlanta-area interstates. Origin of nickname The actual origin of the name in Atlanta came from the city's popular traffic reporter, Dave Straub, who reported traffic on 18 radio and two TV stations. As construction was about midway completed on the massive 11-mile ramp system, Straub was flying over it in a Bell Jet Ranger helicopter reporting a traffic jam and commented that it was beginning to look like an \\"overturned bowl of Spaghetti.\\" He then commented, \\"I think I'll start calling it Spaghetti Junction.' As Atlanta Constitution reporter, Joey Ledford wrote in a July 30, 2004 article, listeners complained about Straub's use of the \\"food reference\\" in his traffic reports, but Straub insisted that it would become a household term. And it did. He stuck with it, and soon, merchants began advertising their locations as being just north or south of \\"Spaghetti Junction.\\" In popular culture The interchange's colloquial name of \\"Spaghetti Junction\\" is mentioned in an eponymous song by the Atlanta-based hip hop group Outkast in their 2000 album Stankonia and in the film Baby Driver, which is set in Atlanta. The interstate has also been pictured on a 2017 album cover, Quality Control: Control the Streets Volume 1. The album features many rising artists that call Atlanta their home, including Migos, Lil Yachty, and Young Thug.

Relatively narrow and nondescript, especially in comparison to the nearby avenue des Champs √âlys√©es, it is cited as being one of the most luxurious and fashionable streets in the world thanks to the presence of virtually every major global fashion house, the √âlys√©e Palace (official residence of the President), the H√¥tel de Pontalba (residence of the United States Ambassador to France), the Embassy of Canada, the Embassy of the United Kingdom, and numerous art galleries. The rue Saint-Honor√©, of which the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√© is now an extension, began as a road extending west from the northern edge of the Louvre Palace. Saint Honor√©, Honorius of Amiens, is the French patron saint of bakers. History Until the 18th century, a few villages were dispersed in a rural area that extended west of the Louvre. The main street (a dirt road) of Roule, one of the villages, became rue Neuve-Saint-Honor√©; it was lined and surrounded by a few mansions. The passage was upgraded in the 12th century to accommodate the increasing traffic from Paris's central market, Les Halles, to the outer villages. (The market was moved in 1971 from the center of Paris to the suburb of Rungis.) The road extended to the edge or gate of Paris. The passage was renamed rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√© when the village became an official suburb of Paris; (foris burgem in Latin means \\"outside the city\\"). Originally, the passage extended to the For√™t de Rouvray (\\"oak forest\\"), which covered a vast area west of Paris. Remnants of it are the Bois de Boulogne, as well as the 5,100 ha For√™t Domaniale de la Londe-Rouvray in Normandy. The rue du Faubourg Saint- Honor√© was incorporated into Paris's city limits in 1860. Contemporary Paris The newest styles in Paris can come from any number of arrondissements but, depending on tradition, the reliable gauge of style in Paris and high style can be found along 10 blocks of rue Saint-Honor√©, from rue Cambon to rue des Pyramides.

A member of the Republican Party, he served as a United States Senator from New York from 1947 to 1959. He was previously a member of the New York State Assembly for sixteen years, serving as Minority Leader (1935), Speaker (1936), and Majority Leader (1937‚Äì1946). A liberal Republican, he was known as a specialist in labor and civil rights legislation. Ives voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. Early life and education Irving Ives was born in Bainbridge, New York, to George Albert and Lucie Hough (n√©e Keeler) Ives. His ancestors came from England to the United States, where they settled in Boston, Massachusetts in 1635; they later helped found Quinnipiac Colony in 1638, and lived in Vermont before moving to New York in 1795. His father worked in the coal and feed business. He received his early education at public schools in Bainbridge and Oneonta, graduating from Oneonta High School in 1914. Ives attended Hamilton College for two years before enlisting in the U.S. Army following the entry of the United States into World War I in 1917. During the war, he served with the American Expeditionary Forces in France and Germany, participating in the Meuse-Argonne and Saint-Mihiel campaigns. He was honorably discharged as a first lieutenant of the Infantry at the war's end in 1919. He then resumed his studies at Hamilton, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1920 and graduated as a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. Early career Ives worked as a bank clerk for Guaranty Trust Company in New York City from 1920 to 1923, earning $25 per week. In 1920, he married Elizabeth Minette Skinner, to whom he remained married until her death in 1947; the couple had one son, George. Joining Manufacturers Trust Company in 1923, he was placed in charge of the bank's business activity in Upstate New York and subsequently moved to Norwich. He remained with Manufacturers Trust until 1930, when he entered the general insurance business in Norwich. On February 18, 1930, Ives was elected to the New York State Assembly (Chenango Co.) to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Bert Lord. He was reelected many times and remained in the Assembly until 1946, sitting in the 153rd, 154th, 155th, 156th, 157th, 158th, 159th, 160th, 161st, 162nd, 163rd, 164th and 165th New York State Legislatures. Ives was Minority Leader in 1935 and Speaker in 1936. His reelection as Speaker was opposed by his fellow liberal Republicans, who disagreed with his opposition to Governor Herbert H. Lehman's proposed social welfare program. Ives stepped aside in favor of Oswald D. Heck, who subsequently named Ives Majority Leader. He served in that position from 1937 to 1946. From 1938 to 1946, Ives was chairman of the State Joint Legislative Committee on Industrial and Labor Conditions. In that position he earned nationwide attention for sponsoring the Ives-Quinn Act of 1945, the first state law to prohibit discrimination in employment on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin. Ives also introduced legislation to create the state Department of Commerce and to establish the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University, of which he was dean from 1945 to 1947. He also served as a member of the New York State War Council (1942 ‚Äì 1946), chairman of New York State Temporary Commission Against Discrimination (1944 ‚Äì 1945), and chairman of the New York State Temporary Commission on Agriculture (1945 ‚Äì 1946). U.S. Senate In 1946, when Democratic incumbent James M. Mead decided to run for Governor of New York, Ives successfully ran for Mead's seat in the United States Senate. He faced former Governor Lehman in the general election, during which he became the first Republican to be endorsed by the New York American Federation of Labor. He defeated Lehman by a margin of 52% to 47%. Ives was the first Republican to represent New York in the Senate since James W. Wadsworth, Jr., who was defeated for reelection in 1926. Despite his moderate reputation, Ives supported the Taft‚ÄìHartley Act in 1947 and voted to override President Harry S. Truman's veto of it; he subsequently lost his longstanding support from labor unions. He served as a delegate to the 1948 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which nominated his friend and fellow liberal New Yorker Thomas E. Dewey. That same year he married his longtime secretary, Marion Mead Crain. Ives was elected to a second term in 1952, defeating Brooklyn borough president John Cashmore by 55% to 36%. He received the largest number of votes hitherto ever won by a candidate in New York, carrying all but three of the state's 62 counties. A strong supporter of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, he served as a delegate to the 1952 Republican National Convention in Chicago, Illinois. In 1954, Ives unsuccessfully ran to succeed Dewey as governor of New York. In one of the closest gubernatorial elections in state history, he lost to Democrat W. Averell Harriman by 11,125 votes. Ives was a delegate to the 1956 Republican National Convention in San Francisco, California. In 1958, he co-sponsored a bill with Senator John F. Kennedy to correct abuses within organized labor as disclosed in hearings before the Rackets Committee. Later life and death In 1958, Ives declined to seek a third term in the Senate. He died at Chenango Memorial Hospital in Norwich, New York at age 66. He is buried at Greenlawn Cemetery in Bainbridge, New York. Legacy Ives is remembered with his desk in the permanent collections of the Chenango County Historical Society and Museum. ReferencesExternal links * *Guide to Irving Ives.

UE was one of the first unions to be chartered by the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and grew to over 600,000 members in the 1940s. UE was founded in March 1936 by several independent industrial unions which had been organized from the ground up in the early and mid-1930s by workers in major plants of the General Electric Company, Westinghouse Electric, RCA and other leading electrical equipment and radio manufacturers. In 1937 a group of local unions in the machine shop industry, led by James J. Matles, left the International Association of Machinists (IAM), objecting to that union's policies of racial discrimination, and joined the young UE. UE withdrew from affiliation with CIO in 1949 over differences related to the developing Cold War, during the early stages of which UE was referred to as one of the basic sources of anti- American propaganda both inside and outside the U.S.Scope of Soviet Activity in the U.S., p. 1585. It suffered significant losses of membership through the 1950s to raids by other unions, in particular the International Union of Electrical Workers (IUE) which was set up by the CIO in 1949 with the goal of replacing UE. The UE and IUE were fierce rivals for many years, but in the 1960s began to cooperate in bargaining with General Electric and other employers. Now representing 35,000 workers in a variety of industries, UE continues actively organizing private and public sector workers, and its democratic structure and practices have attracted several small independent unions to affiliate. Over the past two decades the union has built a strategic alliance with the Authentic Labor Front, an independent Mexican union, and UE is broadly active in international labor outreach and solidarity.Hathaway, Dale, Allies Across the Border: Mexico's \\"Authentic Labor Front\\" and Global Solidarity, South End Press, 2000, Today UE is regarded as one of the most democratic and politically progressive national unions in the United States,Yates, Michael, Why Unions Matter, Monthly Review Press, 2009, Nichols, John \\"Most Valuable Progressives of 2008\\", The Nation and its philosophy and principle of democratic unionism is summed up in its longstanding slogan, \\"The members run this union.\\" On August 27, 2019, UE endorsed Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign. Democratic structure The fundamental unit of UE is the local union. Because UE was founded by existing independent local unions, the union is structured to provide a higher degree of autonomy to locals than in many other national unions. Local union members elect their local officers, negotiators, stewards, and delegates to the regional council and national convention; set policies for their local, including financial decisions; suggest bargaining demands and vote to approve the union's full list of contract proposals; vote to ratify or reject contracts and supplemental agreements with the employer; and decide whether to strike, and when to end a strike, by majority vote. Most UE locals hold monthly membership meetings. Field representatives from the national union assist local unions with bargaining and other activities, but UE's constitution forbids the staff \\"to interfere with UE rank-and-file control, including election processes.\\" Trusteeship of local unions (takeover of a local by the national union) is not provided for in the UE constitution, and has therefore never occurred. From its founding through 2005 UE had an intermediate structure of geographic districts. In 2005 the districts were replaced by three regions, Western, Eastern and Northeast.http://uenortheast.org/ Each region holds meetings two or three times a year, composed of delegates from local unions. The regions elect their own officers and representatives to the General Executive Board (the national board of UE), including a full-time regional president. The regions coordinate work among the locals in their area, including solidarity, political action and union education. Several times a year the regions organize training workshops and other educational events through sub-regions ‚Äì smaller geographic subdivisions. Until 2003 UE held annual conventions, a frequency rare in organized labor; the union's conventions are now biannual. The five-day convention,http://www.ueunion.org/convention.html consisting of elected delegates from UE locals across the country, is the highest decision- making body of the union. It discusses and approves policy resolutions submitted by locals and regions, on matters ranging from the union's bargaining and organizing strategies to domestic and foreign policy issues. Convention delegates participate in workshops and other educational and cultural events; elect the union's three national officers as well as the national trustees; and debate and vote on all proposed amendments to the UE constitution. The salaries of the national officers and staff are specified in the UE constitution, so giving raises to UE's paid officials requires amending the constitution at convention. All amendments to the constitution approved by the convention (including the proposed pay increases) are then sent to all UE locals, to be ratified or rejected by members voting at local union meetings in the weeks following the convention. Every member therefore has a direct vote on whether or not the pay of their national officers and staff will be increased. Between conventions, decisions of the national union are made by the General Executive Board, consisting of the three national officers, the three regional presidents, and 12 additional rank-and-file representatives elected by the regions.United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, Constitution and By-Laws, amended 2011 Financial practices One feature that has distinguished UE from many other US labor unions is its strong emphasis on frugality and financial responsibility. Since UE's founding, its constitution has limited the pay of its officers to \\"a salary not to exceed the highest weekly wage paid in the industry.\\" Linked to the pay rates of production workers at GE, the annual salaries of UE's three national officers are currently $62,072 ‚Äì a fraction of what other unions pay their officers.[4] The salaries of UE regional officers, staff, and those local officers who work for the union full-time, follow the same principle and are somewhat lower. UE is the only national union in the US that explicitly limits the pay of officers to a pay level of membersParker, Mike and Gruelle, Martha, Democracy is Power: Rebuilding Unions from the Bottom Up, Labor Notes, 1999, , p. 179 As noted above, all increases in the pay of UE national officers and staff must be approved by delegates to the national convention, as amendments to the union constitution, and then ratified by membership vote at local union meetings. UE's policy on salaries is deeply rooted in UE's philosophy of unionism. UE sees unionism as a movement and unions as independent organizations of workers. When union leaders live in the same income bracket as rank-and-file workers, it helps them to stay in touch with the outlook and needs of workers. In UE's view, salaries for union officers and staff that are comparable to those of corporate executives tend to undermine a union's commitment to its fundamental purpose. From the local to the national level, UE has a strong ethic of accountability and transparency in all its financial practices, and opposes any trace of what it calls \\"petty corruption\\" among union officials. UE leaders at all levels are taught that union funds belong to the members, and that members are entitled to detailed reports on union finances at all levels, and to democratically decide on major spending. Bargaining and grievances UE's approach to collective bargaining places a premium on membership involvement. In preparation for contract bargaining, UE locals solicit ideas for contract changes from their members, and most locals then conduct a membership vote to approve the full slate of union proposals. UE bargaining committees regularly report back to members, both orally and through publications, during the course of bargaining. UE routinely rejects management pleas for bargaining \\"blackouts,\\" gag rules which prohibit open communication to rank-and-file union members during negotiations. The union frequently calls on its members to collectively demonstrate their support for the union's bargaining goals during contract talks, by wearing T-shirts, buttons or stickers with union insignia and slogans; speaking up to management on key bargaining issues; and through rallies, informational picketing and other actions. Some UE locals even insist on the right of rank-and-file members to attend negotiating sessions as observers. UE is very explicit in mandating that all union negotiations are a collective endeavor. The UE constitution states: \\"No representative of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE) shall negotiate alone with the employer.\\" UE feels that its open and participatory approach to bargaining results in better contracts than bargaining methods which restrict member involvement. Illustration of how UE negotiates with employers can be seen in the union's detailed web reports on its 2011 national bargaining with GE. Fighting for workers over day-to-day injustices on the job is, in UE's view, a central task of unions. The \\"first line of defense\\" in UE's workplace organization consists of elected shop stewards within each department or workgroup. Among unions UE has one of the highest ratios of stewards to members, and aims for a steward- to-supervisor ratio of at least one to one. UE has a strong training program for its stewards, distributes a Steward Kit that includes the exemplary \\"UE Steward Handbook,\\" and publishes a monthly publication, the UE Steward, that provides tactical tips to stewards and local officers for dealing with workplace problems. UE's approach to grievances includes careful investigation of the issue by the steward, being well-prepared for meetings with the employer, and strategies for organizing and mobilizing members to pressure management to resolve the problem. UE warns its locals against excessive reliance on grievance arbitration, pointing out that the majority of arbitration decisions are in favor of management, and that an arbitrator's unfavorable interpretation of a contract clause can harm the union for many years. UE avoids arbitrating grievances that it believes it is unlikely to win and trains its staff and local officers to carefully prepare for those cases they do take to arbitration. In most UE locals, the decision whether to arbitrate a grievance is made by membership vote. In the UE national contract with GE, UE locals retain the right to strike over grievances.2011-2015 National Agreement between General Electric Company and United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, p. 55 Such grievance strikes by UE-GE locals are infrequent and usually of short duration, but the existence of this option gives the union added clout and helps it to favorably resolve many grievances. Early history: growth and schism The CIO granted UE the first charter on November 16, 1938. UE was founded at a March 1936 meeting of existing local unions in plants of the electrical equipment and radio industries, a few months the founding of the CIO. In September 1936 the AFL suspended its member unions that had started the CIO ‚Äì originally called the Committee on Industrial Organization and formed by existing industrial unions within the AFL as a caucus to promote organizing industrial unions in mass production industries. The AFL, dominated by craft unions, soon escalated the conflict by expelling the CIO unions, prominent among which were John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers (UMW) and Sidney Hillman, president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA). Over the next few years a dramatic wave of strikes and mass organizing by industrial workers rapidly built the membership of the CIO and of newly formed industrial unions such as UE, the United Auto Workers (UAW), United Rubber Workers, and United Steelworkers (USW). The UE expanded greatly over the next decade, organizing workers of the major corporations in the electrical equipment, radio and machine tool industries. The union won a contentious strike at RCA and organized additional plants of GE, Westinghouse, GM's electrical division and smaller companies in its base industries. The union signed its first national contract with GE in 1938; Westinghouse, which more stubbornly resisted unionization of its plants, did not sign an agreement until 1941. By the end of World War II, UE was the third largest CIO union, with a membership of over 600,000. As in many of the new CIO unions organized in the 1930s, the membership and leaders of UE included a variety of radicals, including socialists and communists, as well as New Deal liberals and Catholics. Among the organizers and leaders of UE Local 107 at the Westinghouse South Philadelphia works were several former members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).Matles, James J. and Higgins, James, Them and Us: Struggles of a Rank-and-File Union, Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1974, hardcover, ; paperback reprint , chapter 12 While foes of UE in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s charged the union with \\"communist domination,\\" recent studiesStepan-Norris, Judith, and Zeitlin, Maurice, Left Out: Reds and America's Industrial Unions, Cambridge University Press, 2003, hardcover ; paperback have demonstrated that UE was and remains one of the most democratic US labor unionsYates, pp. 77-81 and that its policies differed markedly from those of the US Communist Party on a number of major issues during those decades. Following the outbreak of World War II, UE joined with other unions in the CIO in urging a no-strike pledge and higher productivity for the duration of the war, which UE viewed as a struggle against world fascism and therefore worthy of labor's support. The UE also supported expanded use of piecework systems in industry, which it defended as both necessary to boost production and a way to improve workers' earnings under the wartime wage control systems imposed by the War Labor Board. This appears, in fact, to be largely true: the incentive systems that management used were their loosest during World War II and represented an important, and generally popular, form of compensation for workers. UE continued to bargain aggressively for its members during the war, winning numerous improvements in contract language and benefits. Despite the War Labor Board's policy of freezing wages for the duration of the war, UE leaders devised creative strategies to win WLB approval of pay increases for many of their members. And despite the union's support for the no-strike pledge, UE leaders supported militant actions by their members, such as a strike by UE members at a Babcock & Wilcox plant in New Jersey. Soon after the war ended, beginning in late 1945, the three largest unions of the CIO engaged in a national strike to regain economic ground lost by workers during the war, when wages had been frozen but industrial profits had risen significantly. The United Auto Workers shut down the auto plants of General Motors; UE struck GE, Westinghouse, and the GM electrical division, and the United Steelworkers stopped work in the basic steel industry. The 1946 strikes were successful, but the outcome stiffened the resolve of industrialists to break the power of the CIO through a strategy of divide-and-conquer. The brewing Cold War with the Soviet Union would provide the opportunity, and in October 1946 GE's Charles Wilson summarized the political program of big business when he declared that the problems of the United States could be summed up as \\"Russia abroad, labor at home.\\" Republican victories in the elections of 1946 had brought a much more conservative Congress to Washington, with a determination to curb labor. The Taft-Hartley Act, drafted in large part by lobbyists for the National Association of Manufacturers, General Electric, Inland Steel and other industrialists, represented a major revision of the Wagner Act that significantly weakened labor's ability to organize and effectively negotiate. Among its many anti-union provisions was a clause requiring officers of all unions to sign \\"non-communist affidavits,\\" swearing that they were not members of the Communist Party. Leaders of virtually all CIO and AFL unions denounced this new law, and in particular called the non-communist affidavit clause an intolerable government interference in internal union matters and an encroachment on freedom of speech and association. Union leaders vowed to boycott the Taft-Hartley labor board and agreed in principle that all would refuse to sign the affidavits. But few lived up to that pledge. Some union leaders, including Walter Reuther of the UAW, signed the Taft-Hartley affidavits and then proceeded to raid (attempt to replace) locals of UE and the Farm Equipment Workers (FE), whose leaders were still holding out and refusing to sign. This meant that the raiding union, UAW, would appear on the NLRB ballot, but the incumbent union, UE or FE, could not. The CIO, under President Philip Murray, did nothing to discourage the United Auto Workers from poaching on UE shops in the arms and typewriter industries in the Connecticut River Valley; other unions affiliated with the AFL, such as the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, likewise displaced the UE in some plants. Fissures within UE that appeared around the 1941 convention (when James Carey had been defeated as UE president by Albert J. Fitzgerald, a GE worker from Lynn, Massachusetts) reopened in the late-1940s national political environment of anti-communist hysteria. Up-and-coming Republican politicians, such as Congressman Richard Nixon of California and Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, built their careers by conducting witch-hunts for imagined \\"Communist subversion\\" within the federal government, and by red-baiting their election opponents. The CIO itself was a prime target of the Republican red- baiters. CIO leaders such as Philip Murray of the Steelworkers and Walter Reuther of the UAW responded to these attacks by purging their own unions of Communists, and by attacking those CIO unions, such as UE, that were viewed as Communist dominated. Investigations by the House Un-American Activities Committee and criticism from groups such as the Association of Catholic Trade Unionists, which actively organized dissenters within UE into an opposition faction, put UE leaders on the defensive. Anti-communist raids by other unions removed some conservative members and locals from UE, thereby weakening the right-wing internal opposition. Nonetheless oppositionists were confident that the national political atmosphere would enable them to seize power in UE at the union's 1949 convention. But the right-wing candidates were soundly defeated. UE's convention delegates instead backed their national officers' demands that the CIO stop the UAW and other CIO unions from raiding UE. To defend the union from future raids, UE reversed its refusal to sign Taft- Hartley affidavits, enabling the union to again appear on the ballot in NLRB representation elections. When the CIO refused to take action to stop CIO- affiliated unions from raiding other CIO unions, UE boycotted the CIO's national convention in 1949 and withheld its per capita dues payments, effectively resigning its affiliation to the CIO. The CIO responded by announcing the expulsion of UE as well as that of the United Farm Equipment Workers (FE); the following year the CIO expelled nine other unions believed to be Communist dominated. Of the 11 \\"left\\" unions that were expelled or resigned from the CIO in 1949-50, only UE and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union remain in existence today. All of the others were broken by the relentless attacks of employers, the government and other unions through the period of McCarthyism. In the case of UE, the CIO went a step further, chartering a rival union, the International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (IUE), that would attempt to destroy and replace UE. James Carey, the founding president of UE, was appointed president of the IUE. The IUE won many of the locals in the radio assembly and light manufacturing industries; the UE held on to much of its base in machine building. In the heavy electrical equipment plants, on the other hand, the two factions each had substantial strength. The resulting battles were fierce: in Local 601, which represented Westinghouse workers in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and whose members had a tradition of radical politics dating back to Eugene V. Debs' candidacy for President in 1912, the two factions were led by brothers Mike and Tom Fitzgerald, who attacked each other personally as vigorously as the factions did on political issues. The IUE won a close election, with the semi-skilled workers supporting the IUE while more skilled workers favored the UE. Employers, the federal government, the news media and other establishment forces played major roles in the efforts to eliminate UE. UE was subjected to an endless barrage of inquisitions by Congressional committees, such as the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), Sen. Joseph McCarthy's Subcommittee on Investigations, and a similar committee chaired by Sen. John Marshall Butler. In several instances, these committees used subpoena power to set up UE members to be fired by their employers, unless the subpoenaed worker cooperated by \\"naming names,\\" and thereby subjected other workers to the inquisition. GE fired John Nelson, president of UE's large Local 506http://www.uelocal506.org/ in Erie, Pennsylvania, on just such grounds. The stress resulting from his own firing and the unrelenting persecution of his union destroyed Nelson's health; he died in 1959 at the age of 42. McCarthy's \\"investigations\\" were sometimes carefully scheduled to help the IUE and the companies against UE. In 1953 he held a hearing in Lynn, Massachusetts on the eve of an NLRB election between UE and IUE at the major GE plant there. His grilling of UE members, in the guise of investigating \\"Communist subversion,\\" made for sensationalist news headlines and helped the IUE eke out a narrow win. Several UE shop leaders, as well as UE Secretary-Treasurer Julius Emspak, were put on trial on contempt charges for refusing to cooperate with HUAC. The federal government tried unsuccessfully to take away James Matles's citizenship and deport him; the UE national organizing director had immigrated from Romania as a youth. Other similar prosecutions, harassment by the FBI, vicious attacks in local newspapers, and denunciation by politicians, kept UE under siege for years. The red-baiting attacks on UE during the McCarthy era did tremendous damage to the union, but were eventually shown, even in the prevailing atmosphere of anti-red hysteria, to have no legal merit. Most of the legal cases against UE leaders were eventually withdrawn or defeated in the courts, and in March 1959 the US Justice Department was forced to drop its prosecution of UE on charges that the union was \\"Communist-dominated.\\" It seems a miracle that UE survived the 1950s at all, with attacks coming at it from all directions: the federal administration, Congress, Republicans and Democrats, news media, \\"mainstream\\" unions of both CIO and AFL, and even some members of the clergy. What helped UE to weather these storms was its own democratic structure and manner of operation, and its superior record of representing members (when contrasted with the IUE, for example) in collective bargaining and in fighting for shop grievances. Both of these attributes engendered fierce loyalty to UE among many of its members, even as the union was being slandered by powerful forces as some sort of national security threat. UE loyalists counteracted the IUE by highlighting its relative weakness in standing up to management, and derisively characterized the acronym IUE as standing for \\"Imitation UE.\\" While the UE and the IUE won roughly equal number of elections through the first half of the 1950s, the IUE came away with larger numbers of members, particularly in the growing field of consumer electronics. Other unions, including the IBEW, the IAM, the UAW, the United Steel Workers of America, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the Sheet Metal Workers International Association, also wedged in during these elections. The IUE, moreover, found itself divided, as the divergent groups that had allied to oppose the UE now found it hard to work with each other once in power. James Carey's arrogance eventually caught up with him within the IUE as it had in UE. In 1965 he was defeated for the presidency of IUE by one of his own lieutenants, leaving him with the dubious distinction of being the only person in US labor history to be elected, and subsequently thrown out, as national president of two different unions. During World War II and continuing through the Cold War, UE took a more progressive position on women's rights than other unions, advocating \\"equal pay for equal work\\" during the war in successful suits against GE and Westinghouse before the War Labor Board and, after the war, resisting employers' attempts to drive married women out of industry and to deny seniority and maternity leave to women workers.Lichtenstein, Nelson, State of the Union, Princeton University Press, 2002, , pp. 93-94 The 1946 strike at GE was prolonged by the company's insistence on giving a smaller wage increase to its women employees, whom GE president Charles E. Wilson contemptuously dismissed as \\"bobbysoxers.\\" With all other strike issues resolved, UE held out on the picket lines until GE agreed that women would receive the same raises as men. In the early 1950s, while the union was under attack from all directions, UE organized a series of district and national conferences on the problems of women workers. Local union leaders who opposed UE's policies on gender equality often bolted to the IUE, and took members with them.Kannenberg, Lisa, \\"The Impact of the Cold War on Women's Trade Union Activism: The UE Experience,\\" Labor History 34 (Spring- Summer 1993), pp. 309-323 UE also stood out in that period for its advocacy of equality for African American workers.Stepan-Norris and Zeitlin, chapter 8 In July 1950 UE leaders appointed Ernest Thompson, a black international representative and former rank-and-file factory worker, as secretary of the UE Fair Practices Committee. In essence the union's affirmative action officer, Thompson met with the leadership of UE locals around the country to develop and implement action plans to force employers to hire more black workers, and to give African Americans opportunities to advance into skilled trades jobs. In the midst of the Cold War assaults on UE, the union's newspaper reported such success stories as the promotion of a black worker at Johnson Machine to lathe operator. The company had insisted that this worker was unqualified and refused to train him, so white union members had taught him the job during their lunch breaks.\\"Equality at Work: UE's Early Fights Against Racial Discrimination\\", UE News, Vol. LXIX No. 1, Feb. 2007, pp. 7-9 UE spoke out frequently against the racist government policies of the time, drawing attention to the injustices of \\"Jim Crow\\" racial segregation and denial of black voting rights. UE called for reinstating the federal Fair Employment Practices Committee, a wartime agency created by Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt to stop discrimination in industry, which was disbanded after the war by President Harry Truman. Here again, UE's progressive position was used against it by its foes; in several instances the IUE openly appealed for the votes of white workers on the basis of racial bigotry and by attacking UE's support for racial equality. By 1954, UE officers reported that 87 percent of all UE contracts contained no-discrimination clauses, an achievement that placed UE far ahead of other unions. A second wave of defections in the mid-1950s took several important UE locals, which had survived earlier raiding, into the IUE and other unions. The UE's membership dropped from 200,000 in 1953 to 58,000 in 1960. Some of the losses resulted from companies, including GE and Westinghouse, moving portions of their manufacturing from older plants in the Northeast to new plants in the South and West. The split of 1955-56 largely involved tactical disagreements over how to move the UE's progressive program and brand of unionism forward in the face of the AFL-CIO merger. It proved a bitter disappointment to UE activists who had managed to bring the union successfully through the hardest years of the McCarthy period and the Cold War but who were now unable to keep the union together. Most locals in the UE's New York-north Jersey district (UE District 4) voted to go into the IUE reasoning that they had the strength and experience to influence the policies of the newer union. While this move was resented by UE activists elsewhere, especially in Pennsylvania and the midwest, the District 4 activists felt that the UE forces could soon have regained control of the re-united organization had the whole union followed their lead. By the mid-1960s, the former UE activists in IUE shops played a role in helping to bring about James Carey's ouster in a disputed election. Carey's departure eventually opened the way for the co-ordinated bargaining which partially healed the two decade old division in the industry. UE reshapes itself The UE and IUE began to cooperate in bargaining after the IUE's disastrous 1960 strike against GE. In the successful 103-day national strike in 1969-70, UE and IUE led an alliance of unions which broke the back of Boulwarism, GE's aggressive 20-year-long policy of \\"take-it-or-leave-it\\" bargaining. Boulwarism was named for Lemuel Boulware, the company's vice president of labor and community relations, who devised the strategy in reaction to UE's success in the 1946 strike, and to capitalize on the bitter divisions, after 1949, in the ranks of GE union members. The 1970s brought UE renewed growth through successful organizing. UE lost many members in the 1980s and 1990s as the flight of many manufacturing plants abroad led to plant closings by both major employers in the electrical manufacturing industry, as well as by smaller UE employers. Despite shrinkage of GE's US manufacturing employment, UE remains a major force within General Electric today and plays a leading role in negotiating contracts that cover members of 13 unions in GE through the Coordinated Bargaining Committee. UE's role in the union coalition resulted in union gains in 2007 national negotiations with GE. The UE has broadened its scope in recent years, organizing public employees, service industry workers, school and college employees, and others. The UE has also replaced some other unions in workplaces where the existing unions has failed to adequately represent the membership. The UE has entered into a \\"strategic organizing alliance\\" with the Mexican Frente Aut√©ntico del Trabajo (FAT, \\"Authentic Labor Front\\"), in which the UE and FAT collaborate in organizing and educational projects. UE's organizing alliance with the FAT started in 1992 and grew from the two organizations' shared opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The UE has also formed alliances with non-labor groups, both in the US and internationally, through the World Social Forum, to fight the effects of corporate globalization promoted by institutions of global capital such as the International Monetary Fund and free trade agreements modeled on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Beginning in the mid-1990s, UE has been organizing state and municipal workers in North Carolina, chartering their statewide organization as UE Local 150. A North Carolina state law dating to the Jim Crow era of racial segregation, General Statute 95-98, prohibits public employees from bargaining labor contracts. UE is campaigning to repeal that act and replace it with legislation to facilitate public sector bargaining. As part of that campaign, UE in December 2005 brought a complaint before the International Labour Organization, the UN's labor agency, charging that the North Carolina bargaining ban violates international agreements on labor rights, which uphold the right of nearly all workers to form unions and bargain collectively. In March 2007 the ILO ruled in favor of UE, and called upon the United States and North Carolina to repeal GS 95-98 and begin discussions with unions to establish \\"a framework for collective bargaining.\\" UE's Mexican ally the FAT, with the support of 52 other US, Mexican, Canadian and global labor organizations, filed a complaint in October 2006 with the Mexican National Administrative Office ‚Äì a body established to address complaints of labor rights violations under NAFTA. The complaint charges that the North Carolina bargaining ban violates the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC), the labor-rights side agreement to NAFTA. In November 2007 the Mexican NAO launched an investigation into those charges. The plight of North Carolina public employees was dramatized in September 2006 when sanitation workers for the City of Raleigh conducted a two-day strike over unfair treatment and working conditions. Since the stoppage those workers, organized by UE Local 150, have won improvements and regular consultation of city officials with their elected union leaders.\\"Sanitation Workers‚Äô Job Walkout Energizes UE 150 Justice Campaign.\\" October 17, 2006 UE has expanded its public sector organizing to two other states in the Upper South that also lack public employee bargaining rights, establishing UE Local 160 in Virginia and UE Local 170 in West Virginia. UE has also become known throughout the US labor movement as the \\"National Home for Independent Unions\\", and works with many independent unions across the country. Over the past 20 years a number of existing independent unions have affiliated with UE, seeking the resources, support and solidarity of a national union and attracted by UE's democratic structure and practices. One such victory came in July 2005 when the 2,500 member Connecticut Independent Labor and Police Unions (CILU/CIPU) voted by an overwhelming margin to become UE Local 222.http://www.cilu.org Since joining UE, Local 222's work has focused on bringing democracy, justice and equality to the workplace, and on organizing and mobilizing its members and local communities in fights for gender pay equity, ending all forms of discrimination, and health care for all. The local has also added members by organizing additional groups of school and municipal workers in Connecticut. The Republic Plant Occupation of 2008 On December 5, 2008, members of UE Local 1110 at Republic Windows and Doors in Chicago, when the plant closed with only three days notice to the employees, occupied the plant in protest of the closing and company's failure to pay employees their accrued vacation pay, and payments required under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. The WARN Act requires 60 days notice of a plant closing, or 60 days pay if timely notice is not given. The workers' action drew extensive media coverage and attracted wide support, including from US President-elect Barack Obama, and Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich banned state business with Bank of America, because the bank's cancellation of the company's line of credit had prompted the shutdown.Rupa Shenoy, \\"Ill. governor jumps in to sit- in at shuttered plant,\\" Associated Press, consulted 8 December 2008. Protest demonstrations at Bank of America branches took place in dozens of US cities during the sit-in. On December 10 the union members voted to end the occupation after Republic, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and the union negotiated a settlement that paid each worker eight weeks wages, plus all accumulated vacation pay, and health insurance for two months.Associated Press, \\"It's Over! Sit-in Success,\\" 11 December 2008, consulted 11 December 2008. Two months later a California window manufacturer, Serious Materials, purchased the former Republic plant and reopened it, reinstating the union workers to their jobs in order of seniority and signing a labor contract with UE Local 1110 that was substantially the same as the union's former contract with Republic.Cullotta, Karen Ann. \\"New Owners to Reopen Window Plant, Site of a Sit-In in Chicago,\\" New York Times. February 29, 2009. In April 2009 Vice President Joe Biden visited the plant and met with company officials and union leaders, praising the reopening of the plant as \\"a big deal.\\" In February 2012 Serious Materials management announced the plant's immediate closing. The news was unexpected and the union responded in the same way it had four years prior. Despite its drastic diminution - Serious Materials had called back 75 of the plant's 250 employees, with only 38 employed by the closing's announcement - workers successfully negotiated an agreement with management by that night. Assistance and publicity coincided with the Occupy movement in Chicago, members of which came to the plant. The union agreed to 90 days of employment before the plants closing.

It was founded by Pamela Skaist-Levy and Gela Nash-Taylor in 1997 and was later purchased by the Liz Claiborne fashion company in 2003. Juicy Couture has turned into a global seller with their signature velour tracksuits and other fashions that span clothing, handbags, shoes, intimates, swimwear, fragrance, accessories, sunglasses, yoga and babywear. History Juicy Couture was started by two friends in 1997. Gela Nash (before marrying Duran Duran's John Taylor) and Pamela Skaist-Levy, both residing in Pacoima, California, decided to create their own fashion label, Travis Jeans, selling maternity pants. In 1996 they changed the name to Juicy Couture. All Juicy Couture items are manufactured with the company signature logo: two highland terriers holding a shield bearing three hearts and Love P&G; (for Pamela and Gela). A crown lies on top along with a Juicy Couture flowing banner. From 1996, after establishing their company and needing to get public attention for the brand, Nash and Levy started to send their completed designs to celebrities. In 2001, the famous Juicy tracksuit was introduced and custom designed for Madonna; and Madonna turned the velour tracksuit into a trend. The public appearance of clothes worn by celebrities made the brand famous almost instantly. Madonna was the first big breakthrough celebrity endorsement for the company. Later, in 2004, the velour tracksuit once again became very popular among celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears, and Paris Hilton. Juicy Couture then became a brand known around the world for the image of being the outfit of the \\"new money\\". Juicy Couture was a limited brand being available at few locations until the late 2000s. In 2003 Fifth & Pacific Companies, Inc. (formerly Liz Claiborne Inc.) acquired the company. In 2010, Juicy Couture tapped LeAnn Nealz as Chief Creative Officer and President to guide the brand into its next phase of growth, while preserving the style. Best known for their tracksuits to its status as a luxury icon. An informed \\"guesstimate\\" put Juicy sales at about $200 million in one year. Vogue noted the company's growing ‚Äì even exploding ‚Äì popularity, saying, \\"The time may have come when Seventh Avenue's lofty vantage point suddenly seems less relevant than the ground-level perspective of the designer as consumer.\\" On November 1, 2010, LeAnn Nealz was named President and Chief Creative Officer. In this position, she would be responsible for all creative elements of the business including product design, marketing and store design and will report to Edgar Huber, chief executive officer of Juicy Couture. Former Vogue accessories director Michelle Sanders was also hired to handle new licenses for jewelry, handbags and swimwear. =Sale= On October 7, 2013, Fifth & Pacific, Inc. announced that they would sell Juicy Couture to Authentic Brands Group for $195 million. In June 2014 the company was reported to be closing all its stores in the United States, with the closure expected by the end of June 2015. The company's 60 international stores would remain operating. In September 2014 Juicy Couture began being sold in Kohl's in the United States.

It manifests as hypertensive nephrosclerosis (sclerosis referring to the stiffening of renal components). It should be distinguished from renovascular hypertension, which is a form of secondary hypertension, and thus has opposite direction of causation.  Signs and symptoms  Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease, including loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, itching, sleepiness or confusion, weight loss, and an unpleasant taste in the mouth, may develop.  Causes  \\"Hypertensive\\" refers to high blood pressure and \\"nephropathy\\" means damage to the kidney; hence this condition is where chronic high blood pressure causes damages to kidney tissue; this includes the small blood vessels, glomeruli, kidney tubules and interstitial tissues. The tissue hardens and thickens which is known as nephrosclerosis. The narrowing of the blood vessels means less blood is going to the tissue and so less oxygen is reaching the tissue resulting in tissue death (ischemia). Risk factors for HN include poorly-controlled, moderate-to-high blood pressure, older age, other kidney disorders, and Afro- Caribbean background, whose exact cause is unclear, as it may be due to either genetic susceptibility or poor health management among people of Afro- Caribbean descent.  Mechanism  In the kidneys, as a result of benign arterial hypertension, hyaline (pink, amorphous, homogeneous material) accumulates in the walls of small arteries and arterioles, producing the thickening of their walls and the narrowing of the arterial openings, a process known as arteriolosclerosis. The resulting inadequate blood flow produces tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and glomerular alterations (smaller glomeruli with different degrees of hyalinization ‚Äì from mild to sclerosis of glomeruli) and scarring around the glomeruli (periglomerular fibrosis). In advanced stages, kidney failure will occur. Functional nephrons have dilated tubules, often with hyaline casts in the opening of the tubules. Additional complications often associated with hypertensive nephropathy include glomerular damage resulting in protein and blood in the urine. Hypertensive nephropathy refers to kidney failure that can be attributed to a history of hypertension It is a chronic condition and it is a serious risk factor for the development of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, despite the well-known association between hypertension and chronic kidney disease, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The two proposed mechanisms of HN‚Äôs pathophysiology both centre around how the glomerulus, a network of dense capillaries that carries out the kidney filtration process, is affected; with one theory identifying glomerular ischemia as the main contributor to HN and the other identifying glomerular hypertension and glomerular hyperfiltration at the centre of HN‚Äôs pathogenesis. = Glomerular ischemia = High blood pressure in the long term can damage the endothelium, commonly known as the blood vessel lining. This leads to a build-up of plaques and they can be deposited in the renal arteries causing stenosis and ischemic kidney disease. In this situation, the kidney supplied blood by the narrowed renal artery suffers from inadequate blood flow, which in turn causes the size of the kidneys to decrease. Other consequences include arterial stiffening, which involves a gradual breakdown of elastic fibers and intima (the innermost layer of a blood vessel) thickening. = Glomerular hypertension and glomerular hyperfiltration = An alternative mechanism of hypertensive nephropathy is prolonged glomerular hypertension and hence glomerular hyperfiltration. These can occur simultaneously but not necessarily. The idea is that hypertension results in sclerosis of the glomeruli which ultimately means reduced kidney function. As a compensatory mechanism, the unaffected nephrons (specifically, the preglomerular arterioles) vasodilate to increase blood flow to the kidney perfusion and increase glomerular filtration across undamaged glomeruli.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis of HN is made from a clinical history and biochemical investigations. Chronic hypertension with progressive kidney disease progresses over a long period of time. Damage to the glomeruli allows proteins that are usually too large to pass into the nephron to be filtered. This leads to an elevated concentration of albumin in the urine (albuminuria). This albuminuria usually does not cause symptoms but can be indicative of many kidney disorders. Protein in the urine (proteinuria) is best identified from a 24-hour urine collection. Bilateral renal artery stenosis should always be considered as a differential diagnosis for the presentation of HN. Kidney disease with this etiology can potentially be reversed following vascular intervention. = Histology = In benign nephrosclerosis, the changes occurring are gradual and progressive, however, there can be sufficient kidney reserve capacity to maintain adequate kidney function for many years. The large renal arteries exhibit intimal thickening, medial hypertrophy, duplication of the elastic layer. The changes in small arterioles include hyaline arteriolosclerosis (deposition of hyaline, collagenous material), which causes glomerular collapse (wrinkling and thickening of capillary basement membranes and collapse of capillary lumen) and solidification (glomeruli exhibit sclerosis and increase in mesangial matrix). The degree of scarring correlates with the degree of glomerular filtration deficit.

File:Histopathology of renal interstitial fibrosis of hypertensive nephropathy.jpgLight micrograph showing signs of hypertensive nephropathy: interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy with thickened tubular basement membranes, and fibrous intimal thickening of a small artery (arrow). Malignant nephrosclerosis is where hypertensive nephrosclerosis occurs in presence of malignant hypertension (when DBP > 130mmHg). Vessels feature intimal thickening, fibrinoid necrosis, red blood cell fragmentation, extravasation, thrombosis. These changes create an exaggerated layered appearance (onion skinning). = Urine test = Microalbuminuria (moderate increase in the levels of urinary albumin) is a non-specific finding in patients with vascular disease that is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. The majority of patients with benign nephrosclerosis have proteinuria in the range from 0.5 to 1 g/ 24hr. In the case of glomerular damage occurring in HN, hematuria can occur as well. = Definitive diagnosis = The definitive diagnosis of HN requires morphological examination. Common histological features can be identified in the renal and glomerular vasculature. Glomerulosclerosis is often present, either focally or globally, which is characterized by hardening of the vessel walls. Also, luminal narrowing or the arteries and arterioles of the kidney system. However, this type of procedure is likely to be preceded with a provisional diagnosis based on laboratory investigations. = Future diagnostic approaches = Increasing access to, and use of, genome profiling may provide opportunity for diagnosis based on presentation and genetic risk factors, by identifying ApoL1 gene variants on chromosome 22.  Management  The aim of the medical treatment is to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease by reducing blood pressure and albumin levels. The current published guidelines define ideal BP of <130/80 mmHg for patients with hypertensive nephropathy; studies show that anything higher or lower than this can increase cardiovascular risk. According to the African American Study of Kidney Disease (AASK) trial, after an additional 5 years follow-up upon completion of the 10-year trial, up to 65% of the cohort had progressive nephropathy despite having controlled the mean systolic BP level <135 mmHg. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, direct renin inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists, are pharmacological treatments that can be used to lower BP to target levels; hence reducing neuropathy and proteinuria progression. The management plan should be individualized based on the condition of the patients including comorbidities and previous medical history. In addition, there are lifestyle changes that can be made. Weight reduction, exercise, reducing salt intake can be done to manage hypertensive nephropathy.  Prognosis  According to the United States Renal Data System (USRDS), hypertensive nephropathy accounts for more than one-third of patients on hemodialysis and the annual mortality rate for patients on hemodialysis is 23.3%. Haemodialysis is recommended for patients who progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and hypertensive nephropathy is the second most common cause of ESKD after diabetes. Patient prognosis is dependent on numerous factors including age, ethnicity, blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate. Changes in lifestyle factors, such as reduced salt intake and increased physical activity have been shown to improve outcomes but are insufficient without pharmacological treatment.  Epidemiology  The incidence of hypertensive nephropathy varies around the world. For instance, it accounts for as many as 25% and 17% of patients starting dialysis for end- stage kidney disease in Italy and France respectively. Contrastingly, Japan and China report only 6 and 7% respectively. Since the year 2000, nephropathy caused by hypertension has increased in incidence by 8.7% In reality, these figures may be even higher, as hypertension is not always reported as the specific cause of kidney disease. It has been recognized that the incidence of hypertensive nephropathy varies with ethnicity. Compared to Caucasians, African Americans in the USA are much more likely to develop hypertensive nephropathy. Of those who do, the proportion who then go on to develop end- stage kidney failure is 3.5 times higher than in the Caucasian population. In addition to this, African Americans tend to develop hypertensive nephropathy at a younger age than Caucasians (45 to 65, compared to >65).

The book was based on Heyerdahl's original report P√• Jakt efter Paradiset, which was published in Norway in 1938, but because of the outbreak of World War II was never translated and rather forgotten. Background On the occasion of their honeymoon, Thor Heyerdahl and his first wife Liv determined to escape from civilization, and to \\"return to nature\\". They nominally had an academic mission, to research the spread of animal species between islands, but in reality they intended to \\"run away to the South Seas\\" and never return home. The couple arrived at Fatu Hiva in 1937, in the valley of Omo‚Äòa. Finding that civilization, albeit on a vastly reduced scale, was still present there, they decided to cross over the island's mountainous interior to settle in one of the small, nearly abandoned, valleys on the eastern side of the island. There, they made their thatch-covered stilted home in the valley of Uia. On the origins of the Polynesians It was in this setting, surrounded by the ruins of the formerly glorious Marquesan civilization, that Heyerdahl first developed his theories regarding the possibility of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact between the pre-European Polynesians, and the peoples and cultures of South America. During several exchanges with an elderly Marquesan man who lived in Uia with them, a former cannibal named Tei Tetua, Heyerdahl determined that, although prior to the arrival of Europeans, cats were not to be found in Polynesia, the Marquesans were nonetheless familiar with the creatures, and indeed, certain of the carved tiki figures seemed very much to represent felines: :To our surprise, the reliefs of two human figures with hands above their heads appeared, and between them, two large quadrupeds in profile, each with an eye, a mouth, erected ears, and a tail. Two quadrupeds!...A cat?...Felines yes, but not rats. (p.173) :To the present day, Andean peasants consider the hail-cat, \\"ccoa\\" - seen with hail running out of his eyes - a beast to be reckoned with. (Sullivan, \\"The Secret Of The Incas\\", p.139) :The ccoa was an important figure in the Andean cultures. In the Mayan language, toh is the name for the puma. In Polynesia, toa is the word for \\"brave\\". Cats are not native to Polynesia, but somehow feline icons are found in their primitive sculptures and figures. In Samoa, pusi is an English derivative that was adopted with the newly arrived cat. In Fatu-Hiva, the name for cat is \\"poto\\". The fact that cats seem to display some sense of keen intellect probably caused the natives to name the new arrivals poto after the Polynesian word for smart, poto. The observation prompted Heyerdahl to ask Tei Tetua from whence his people had come, to which he replied \\"the east\\": :\\"From where?\\" I asked, and was curious to hear the old man's reply. \\"From Te Fiti [The East]\\", answered the old man and nodded toward that part of the horizon where the sun rose, the direction in which there was no other land except South America. (p.217) Heyerdahl went on to explore this possibility a number of years later, as is detailed in his books Kon-Tiki and Aku-Aku: The Secret of Easter Island. Disillusion Initially, the Heyerdahls found life on Fatu Hiva to be idyllic, what with the abundance of fruit trees and readily available unpolluted river water. The charm soon wore off, however, as they had to face the reality of elephantiasis-bearing mosquitos, as well as other unfamiliar tropical diseases. Eventually, also, Thor and Liv found it impossible to live among the local people and ended up sheltering in a cave, anxious to get home. The book begins with Heyerdahl's optimistic idea that paradise could still be found. By the end of the book, Heyerdahl bitterly concludes: :There is nothing for modern man to return to. Our wonderful time in the wilderness had given us a taste of what man had abandoned and what mankind was still trying to get even further away from. ... Progress today can be defined as man's ability to complicate simplicity. ... Nothing in all the procedure that modern man, helped by all his modern middlemen, goes through before he earns money to buy a fish or a potato will ever be as simple as pulling it out of the water or soil. Without the farmer and the fisherman, modern society would collapse, with all its shops and pipes and wires. The farmers and the fishermen represent the nobility of modern society; they share their crumbs with the rest of us, who run about with papers and screwdrivers attempting to build a better world without a blueprint.

Anne Treisman 1935 - 2018. Retrieved 14 Feb 2018, from https://behavioralpolicy.princeton.edu/news/anne-treisman-1935-2018 was an English psychologist who specialised in cognitive psychology. Treisman researched visual attention, object perception, and memory. One of her most influential ideas is the feature integration theory of attention, first published with Garry Gelade in 1980. Treisman taught at the University of Oxford, University of British Columbia, University of California, Berkeley and Princeton University. Notable postdoctoral fellows she supervised included Nancy Kanwisher and Nilli Lavie. In 2013 Treisman received the National Medal of Science from President Barack Obama for her pioneering work in the study of attention. During her long career, Treisman experimentally and theoretically defined the issue of how information is selected and integrated to form meaningful objects that guide human thought and action.  Life and education  Anne Treisman was born in Wakefield, Yorkshire, England. Two years later, her family moved to a village near Rochester, Kent where her father, Percy Taylor, worked as chief education officer during World War II. Her mother, Suzanne Touren, was French. At the age of 11, Treisman moved with her family to Reading, Berkshire where she attended the girls‚Äô grammar school Kendrick School. The English educational system at the time forced Treisman to choose only three subjects in her last two years at secondary school, and Treisman focused on the language arts (French, Latin and History). Treisman received her BA in French Literature at Newnham College, Cambridge in 1954. She received a first class BA with distinction, which earned her a scholarship that she used to obtain a second BA in psychology. During this extra year, Treisman studied under the supervision of Richard Gregory, who introduced her to various methods of exploring the mind through experiments in perception.Wikibooks:Applied History of Psychology/History of Research on Attention While at Cambridge, she was active in the folk music scene. In 1957, Treisman attended the University of Oxford to work toward her DPhil under her advisor, Carolus Oldfield. Treisman conducted research on aphasia, but soon pursued interest in non-clinical populations. Treisman's research was guided by Donald Broadbent's book, Perception and Communication. After three years of research, she married Michel Treisman in 1960, another Oxford graduate student. Two years later, Treisman completed her thesis, \\"Selective Attention and Speech Perception\\" in 1962. In 1976, Treisman's marriage to Michel ended in a divorce. She remarried in 1978 to Daniel Kahneman, who won the Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics in 2002. She died on 9 February 2018, from a stroke, at her home in Manhattan.  Career  Around the time Treisman was working toward her DPhil, psychology was shifting from a behaviorist point to view to the idea that behavior is the outcome of active information processing. Donald Broadbent and Colin Cherry had recently introduced the idea of selective listening (often exemplified by the so-called \\"cocktail party effect\\") Broadbent later proposed a Filter Model of selective attention which states that unattended auditory information is not analysed but rather it is filtered out early in the process of perception. This theory was criticised because it could not explain why unattended information sometimes gets through the \\"filter\\". After receiving her DPhil, Treisman worked in the Medical Research Council Psycholinguistics Research Unit conducting research in selective listening. In 1964, Treisman proposed her Attenuation Theory, which modified Broadbent's Filter model by stating that unattended information is attenuated rather than completely filtered out. Treisman used a dichotic listening task during which participants heard multiple languages and different voices (male vs. female). She showed that a difference between two equally known languages allowed no more efficient selection than a difference in subject matter between two messages in the same language. Unknown foreign languages, however, produced less interference. It appeared that complete rejection of one language was almost impossible; with some degree of variability depending on physical characteristics and language of the message received. Treisman concluded that features of multiple incoming messages are successfully analysed, and that selection between messages in the same voice, intensity, and localisation takes place during, rather than before or after, this analysis, which results in the identification of their verbal content. Information-handling capacity is limited following this analysis; the process handles one input at a time, either keeping to one message where possible, or switching between the two. Thus, Broadbent's suggestion that classes of words constitute separate \\"input channels\\" could be rejected. Her theory also indicated that physical characteristics are processed early, while semantic processing occurs at a later point. Her work had an enormous impact on her field. For example, In 1967, while working as a visiting scientist at Bell Telephone Laboratories' psychology department, she published a paper in Psychological Review that was \\"central to the development of selective attention as a scientific field of study\\". Treisman and Kahneman accepted positions at the University of British Columbia shortly after their marriage. In 1980, Treisman and Gelade published their seminal paper on Feature Integration Theory (FIT). One key element of FIT is that early stages of object perception encode features such as color, form, and orientation as separate entities; focused attention combines these distinct features into perceived objects. Treisman moved to the University of California, Berkeley, in 1986, where she and Kahneman ran a joint \\"Attention Lab\\" in the Psychology Department. From 1993 until her retirement, in 2010, Treisman was a member of the Psychology Department at Princeton University. She was named Princeton's James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Psychology in 1995. Her work has appeared in 29 book chapters and more than 80 journal articles and is heavily cited in the psychological literature, as well as prominently included in both introductory and advanced textbooks. Established with an anonymous gift in 2015, the Kahneman-Treisman Center for Behavioral Science & Public Policy, housed in Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School, honors the legacy of Daniel Kahneman and Anne Treisman.  Feature integration theory  Treisman's feature integration theory is a two-stage model of visual object perception: ;Pre-attentive stage The first stage is called \\"pre-attentive\\" because it happens automatically, or without effort or attention by the perceiver. In this stage, an object is broken down into its elementary features for processing (i.e., color, texture, shape, etc.). Treisman posits we are unaware of this stage of attention because it occurs quickly and early in perceptual processes (before conscious awareness). Evidence for the pre- attentive state comes from Treisman's own studies. In a well-known study, Treisman created a display of four objects flanked by two black numbers. The display flashed on a computer screen for 1/5 of a second and followed by a random-dot masking field to eliminate residual perception of the stimuli after the stimuli were turned off. Participants were asked to first report on the black numbers, followed by what they saw at each of the four locations where the shapes had been. Under these conditions, participants reported seeing illusory conjunctions in 18% of trials. That is, participants reported seeing objects that consisted of a combination of features from two different stimuli. For example, after seeing a big yellow circle, a big blue triangle, a small red triangle, and a small green circle, a person might report seeing a small red circle and a small green triangle. The reason illusory conjunctions occurred is that stimuli were presented rapidly and the observers' attention was distracted from the target object by having them focus on the black numbers; thus, elementary features had not yet been grouped or bound to an object. Having participants attend to the target objects eliminated the illusory conjunction. ;Focused attention stage The second stage of processing depends on attention. In this stage, the features are combined, resulting in the perception of a whole object rather than individual features. Treisman linked this process of binding to neural activity, noting that an object causes activity in both the \\"what\\" and \\"where\\" areas of the cortex (see Two- streams hypothesis). Activity in the \\"what\\" processing stream would include information about color and form, while activity in the \\"where\\" stream would include information about location and motion. According to Treisman, attention is the \\"glue\\" that combines the information from both streams and causes us to perceive all the features of an object as combined at one specific location. Perceiving one object in isolation appears relatively straightforward, but when we confront multiple objects, numerous features may exist at different locations. The perceptual system's task is to associate each of these features with the object to which it belongs. Feature integration theory says that in order for this to occur, we need to focus our attention on each object in turn. Once we attend to a particular location, the features at that location are bound together and are associated with the object at that location. Treisman's FIT model now uses three different spatially selective mechanisms to solve the binding problem: selection by a spatial attention window, inhibition of locations from feature maps containing unwanted features, and top-down activation of the location containing the currently attended object. The binding problem William James discussed the connection between attention and mental processes, \\"Millions of items‚Ä¶are present to my senses which never properly enter my experience. Why? Because they have no interest for me. My experience is what I agree to attend to‚Ä¶Everyone knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought‚Ä¶. It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others.\\" In the early 1980s, neuroscientists such as Torsten Wiesel and David H. Hubel were discovering that different areas of the primate visual cortex were finely tuned to selective features, such as line orientation, luminance, color, movement, etc. These findings prompted the question of how these distinct features are connected into a unified whole. This question has been called the binding problem. For example, when you see a red ball roll by, cells sensitive to movement fire in the medial temporal cortex, while cells sensitive to color, shape and location fire in other areas. Despite all this distinct neuronal firing, you don't perceive the ball as separated by shape, movement and color perceptions; you experience an integrated experience with all these components occurring together. The question of how these elements are combined is the essence of the binding problem, a central focus of research into the late 1990s. A number of possible mechanisms were envisaged, including grandmother cells responding to specific conjunctions of features that uniquely identify a particular object; local cell assemblies onto which the pathways from different feature maps converge, perhaps with adjustable connections allowing flexible routing of signals; a serial scan of different spatial areas selected by an adjustable attention window, conjoining the features that each contains and excluding features from adjacent areas; detection of temporal contiguity ‚Äì parts and properties whose onset, offset or motion coincide probably belong to the same object synchronised firing of cells responding to features of the same object, perhaps assisted by oscillatory neural activity. Treisman used failures of binding to shed light on its underlying mechanisms. Specifically, she found that left-brain-damaged patients have increasing illusory conjunctions and decreased performance in a spatially cued attention task, which suggests a link between attentional binding and the parietal lobes. Treisman also cited corroborating evidence from positron emission tomography and event-related potential studies which were consistent with the spatial attention account of feature integration. Treisman's work formed the basis for thousands of experiments in cognitive psychology, vision sciences, cognitive science, neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience.  Honors  Treisman was elected to the Royal Society of London in 1989, the US National Academy of Sciences in 1994, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1995, as well as a William James Fellow of the American Psychological Society in 2002. Treisman was the recipient of the 2009 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Psychology for her explanation of how our brains build meaningful images from what we see. In 2013, Treisman received the National Medal of Science from President Barack Obama for her pioneering work in the study of attention.

These scenes may either have the cameraman directly engaging in sex (as in gonzo pornography) or merely filming others having sex. The genre presents itself as \\"real couples having real sex\\". It has been described as professionally made porn which seeks to emulate the style of amateur pornography. The niche's popularity grew significantly in 2000s. Examples include the Girls Gone Wild and Girls Who Like Girls Series. The work of Bruce Seven has been called reality porn, due to his lack of using scripts and asking his performers to act naturally in their own character. Reality Kings, Money Talks and Brazzers are other reality porn websites. In order to comply with the industry's requirements for sexually transmitted disease (STD) testing, the vast majority of reality porn involves professional actors and actresses posing as so-called \\"amateurs.\\" Even though the performers who perform in these films typically appear on many reality websites within a short span of time, most of these websites claim that each of them is an amateur. Another variant of reality pornography consists of normal couples that are filmed by professionals, in which case the only obvious distinction from amateur pornography is the higher quality of production, filming and editing.

A common dish in the north-east of England, it is consumed to a lesser extent in the rest of Britain, as well as in Newfoundland, Canada. Dish Pease pudding is typically thick, somewhat similar in texture to (but perhaps a little more solid than) hummus, and is light yellow in colour, with a mild taste. Pease pudding is traditionally produced in England, especially in the industrial North Eastern areas. It is often served with ham or bacon, beetroot and stottie cakes. It is also a key ingredient in the classic saveloy dip. In Southern England, it is usually served with faggots. Also in Southern England is the small village of Pease Pottage which, according to tradition, gets its name from serving pease pottage to convicts either on their way from London to the South Coast, or from East Grinstead to Horsham. Peasemeal brose, also known as brosemeal, is a traditional breakfast dish in the north of Scotland. It is made in the traditional way and usually eaten with butter, and either salt or honey. In parts of the Midlands, it replaces mushy peas as a traditional accompaniment to fish and chips and is thought to be the original side order, only to be later replaced with mushy peas due to a lack of knowledge or availability of the dish. Etymology In Middle English, \\"pease\\" was a mass noun, used in the same way as 'flour' or 'oatmeal'. The modern singular 'pea' and its plural 'peas' derive from this. Regional variations The dish is a traditional part of Jiggs dinner in Newfoundland, Canada. In German-speaking countries, pease pudding is known under the name Erbsp√ºree or Erbsenp√ºree. Alternative regional names are Erbsbrei or Erbsmus. It is especially widespread in the traditional cuisine of the German capital Berlin. The best-known German dish which is traditionally served with pease pudding is Eisbein. A similar dish with ham hock, karka, is served in Lithuania. In Beijing cuisine, Wandouhuang (Ë±åË±ÜÈªÑ) is a sweetened and chilled pease pudding made with yellow split peas or shelled mung beans, sometimes flavoured with sweet osmanthus blossoms and dates. A refined version of this snack is said to have been a favourite of Empress Dowager Cixi. In Greek cuisine, a similar dish is called Fava (Œ¶Œ¨Œ≤Œ±). Despite the name, it is usually made from yellow split peas, not Fava beans. The mashed peas are usually drizzled with olive oil and topped with chopped raw onions. Recipe Generally recipes for pease pudding involve steeping soaked split yellow peas in stock (traditionally ham hock stock) and cooking them for around 40 minutes. The resulting mush is then blended with other ingredients, which depend on the variation. The oldest known written recipe for something similar to pease pudding involves saffron, nutmeg and a little cinnamon in the blending process; modern recipes sometimes beat in an egg at this point to act as an extra binding agent. In popular culture Pease pudding is featured in a nursery rhyme, \\"Pease Porridge Hot\\".I. Opie and P. Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), p. 345. The song \\"Food, Glorious Food\\" from the 1960s West End and Broadway musical (and 1968 film) Oliver! features a lyric extolling pease pudding. In The Princess and the Goblin, Curdie takes bread and pease pudding with him for sustenance when he goes to spy on the King's house. A discussion on Pease Pudding features in the very 1st episode of BBC TV Soap EastEnders. Peas Pudding also featured in Geordie Shore Season 16 Episode 10 as the cast members handed out leaflets and samples promoting the product.

ATN presents with acute kidney injury (AKI) and is one of the most common causes of AKI. Common causes of ATN include low blood pressure and use of nephrotoxic drugs. The presence of \\"muddy brown casts\\" of epithelial cells found in the urine during urinalysis is pathognomonic for ATN. Management relies on aggressive treatment of the factors that precipitated ATN (e.g. hydration and cessation of the offending drug). Because the tubular cells continually replace themselves, the overall prognosis for ATN is quite good if the underlying cause is corrected, and recovery is likely within 7 to 21 days. Classification ATN may be classified as either toxic or ischemic. Toxic ATN occurs when the tubular cells are exposed to a toxic substance (nephrotoxic ATN). Ischemic ATN occurs when the tubular cells do not get enough oxygen, a condition that they are highly sensitive and susceptible to, due to their very high metabolism. Diagnosis Acute tubular necrosis is classified as a \\"renal\\" (i.e. not pre-renal or post-renal) cause of acute kidney injury. Diagnosis is made by a FENa (fractional excretion of sodium) > 3% and presence of muddy casts (a type of granular cast) in urinalysis. On histopathology, there is usually tubulorrhexis, that is, localized necrosis of the epithelial lining in renal tubules, with focal rupture or loss of basement membrane.TheFreeDictionary > tubulorrhexis Citing: The American Heritage Medical Dictionary 2007 Proximal tubule cells can shed with variable viability and not be purely \\"necrotic\\". Toxic ATN Toxic ATN can be caused by free hemoglobin or myoglobin, by medication including antibiotics such as aminoglycoside, statins such as atorvastatin, and cytotoxic drugs such as cisplatin, or by intoxication (ethylene glycol, \\"anti-freeze\\"). Histopathology: Toxic ATN is characterized by proximal tubular epithelium necrosis (no nuclei, intense eosinophilic homogeneous cytoplasm, but preserved shape) due to a toxic substance (poisons, organic solvents, drugs, heavy metals). Necrotic cells fall into the tubule lumen, obturating it, and determining acute kidney failure. Basement membrane is intact, so the tubular epithelium regeneration is possible. Glomeruli are not affected. Ischemic ATN Ischemic ATN can be caused when the kidneys are not sufficiently perfused for a long period of time (i.e. renal artery stenosis) or during shock. Hypoperfusion can also be caused by embolism of the renal arteries. Given their importance in massive nutrient and electrolyte reabsorption, the proximal tubule and medullary thick ascending limb require significant ATP and are most susceptible to ischemic damage. Thus, ischemic ATN specifically causes skip lesions through the tubules.

Until 1803 the Eichsfeld was for centuries part of the Archbishopric of Mainz, which is the cause of its current position as a Catholic enclave in the predominantly Protestant north of Germany. Following German partition in 1945, the West German portion became Landkreis Duderstadt. A few small transfers of territory between the American and Soviet zones of occupation took place in accordance with the Wanfried Agreement. Geography Typical landscape in the Eichsfeld: Villages between fields and wooded hills Today the greatest part of the Obereichsfeld makes up the Landkreis (district) Eichsfeld. Other parts belong to the district Unstrut-Hainich-Kreis. The Untereichsfeld, later Landkreis Duderstadt, was merged mostly with the Landkreis of G√∂ttingen, while Lindau became part of Katlenburg-Lindau which is now part of the Landkreis of Northeim. Cities in the Eichsfeld are Duderstadt, Heiligenstadt, Leinefelde-Worbis and Dingelst√§dt. History Eichsfeld map from 1759 The Eichsfeld was first mentioned in 897, and in 1022 the Archbishopric of Mainz listed its possessions in the region, which were increased up until 1573. The Ottonian Untereichsfeld became part of Eichsfeld after being part of Brunswick-L√ºneburg and Grubenhagen between 1342 and 1434. During the German Peasants' War within the Reichsstadt of M√ºhlhausen most of the monasteries, churches and castles were plundered and most of the Eichsfeld became Protestant. In 1575 the Society of Jesus successfully established the Counter-Reformation in Eichsfeld. The Thirty Years' War reached Eichsfeld in 1622 and during the years following several armies (Swedish, Danish, Thuringian) plundered the region. According to the Peace of Westphalia the Archbishopric of Mainz reestablished Catholicism in the area which was two thirds devastated and had lost 75% of its population. During the Napoleonic time Eichsfeld was part of the Kingdom of Westphalia, which was dissolved after the victory over Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig. From 1949 to 1990 the Obereichsfeld belonged to the GDR. In this atheistic state the people preserved their Catholic roots, and church life stayed relatively intact. Politics In consequence of the traditionalism in Eichsfeld, the percentage of voters for the CDU is significantly higher than in the surrounding area.

He is the martial arts master who trained Ryu and Ken, as well as the elder brother and former training partner of Akuma. Gouken is usually depicted as a bearded man who wears Japamala prayer beads on his neck and a karate gi with the kanji mu (ÁÑ°), or \\"void\\" sewn to the back. Although Gouken has been a supporting character in the Street Fighter series since Super Street Fighter II Turbo, he did not make his first full-fledged appearance in the video game until his appearance as a hidden character in Street Fighter IV. Character development While the backstory for the early installments of the Street Fighter series established that Ryu and Ken trained under the same martial arts master and that the master was killed by his brother, the identity of this character was originally unnamed. The character Gouken was conceived to serve this role in the Masaomi Kanzaki manga Street Fighter II: Ryu, an adaptation of the original Street Fighter II showcased in Japan's Family Computer Magazine (and later adapted into English under the simplified title Street Fighter II). In the storyline of the book, Gouken trained Ryu and Ken in his temple somewhere in the Japanese wilderness. One day, Akuma stormed Goukens dojo and killed him, leaving Ryu and Ken with the duty to avenge their masters death. While the novel took liberties with the established canon of the games, Goukens character would be adapted in the storyline of the later games in the series following Akuma's introduction in Super Street Fighter II Turbo. Other characters were also conceived to fill the role of Ryu and Kens mentor in licensed adaptations. in Street Fighter II: The Anime Movie, which was released shortly after Super Street Fighter II Turbo in Japan, is mentioned to be Ryu and Ken's master when their vital statistics are compared in a scene. Although Goutetsu was also introduced in Akuma's background story in Super Turbo as well, in the video game canon he serves the role of Gouken and Akuma's sensei. Also filling a similar role is in the 1995 manga Street Fighter II V Retsuden by Yasushi Baba (a loose adaptation of the TV anime series Street Fighter II V serialized at Comic Bon Bon). In Retsuden, Gou-un was the assistant instructor who taught Ryu how to perform a Hadouken. The instruction manual for the North American and European versions of Street Fighter II for the SNES identified Ryu and Ken's master under the name of Sheng Long, a name derived from a mistranslation of Ryu's victory phrase in the arcade version of the game (\\"You must defeat Sheng Long to stand a chance\\"), which was also basis of the hoax character of the same name. In fact, Sheng Long is the Mandarin pronunciation of the first two kanji characters in , the Japanese name of the Dragon Punch, one of Ryu and Ken's special techniques. Sh≈çry≈´ken, or shƒìng l√≥ng qu√°n in Mandarin, means \\"Rising Dragon Fist\\". Sheng Long was later used as the name of Ryu and Ken's master in the Malibu Comics and Movie game. Gouken makes his first full-fledged appearance as a fighter in the arcade version of Street Fighter IV, where he appears as a secret computer-controlled challenger. His presence in the game was hinted months before his official appearance in the game, with Street Fighter IV project manager Natsuki Shiozawa showing a silhouetted illustration in her blog, claiming that the character was \\"Sheng Long\\", as well as the character being featured in an animated teaser for the console versions of Street Fighter IV and in Akumas ending in the game. In the home versions of Street Fighter IV he becomes a selectable character. Fictional background Gouken (left), as seen in Akuma's ending in Street Fighter Alpha, with Goutetsu (middle) and M. Bison. According to the backstory that was developed for Super Street Fighter II Turbo and the Street Fighter Alpha series, Gouken and Akuma learned a murderous martial art style from their master, Goutetsu. It included the special techniques the Hadouken, the Shoryuken and the Tatsumaki Senpukyaku, 20 years before the Street Fighter tournament. After Goutetsu was killed by Akuma, Gouken refined these special techniques, eliminating the \\"murderous energy\\" they possessed, and developed them into a purely combative martial art. He would then teach this new style to two students, Ryu and Ken. Gouken also trained Dan at one time, but then expelled him after seeing that Dan was motivated by revenge. Gouken makes an appearance in Akuma's ending in the original Street Fighter Alpha, in which he is depicted as a white-bearded old man with bushy eyebrows. Akumas dialogue exchange with Ryu in Street Fighter Alpha 2 suggest that Akuma killed Gouken prior to the events of the Alpha series. Suzaku Castle, Ryu's home stage in the Street Fighter II series, Street Fighter Alpha 2, and Street Fighter III 3rd Strike, is the apparent resting place of Gouken. In Street Fighter IV, Capcom retconned that Gouken had died during his battle with Akuma and was still alive. In Gouken's animated opening he reveals that after losing in battle to Akuma he did not die but was simply rendered unconscious for an extended period of time. Gouken survived the Shun Goku Satsu by completely emptying his soul of emotions, which left him in a deep coma. He is shown watching as Ryu and Ken walk off, believing him, Gouken, to be dead. He is not concerned, however, what Ryu and Ken believe as he knows that their path is a righteous one and that he looks forward to reuniting with them once more someday. Gouken's mid-game cutscene show him confront Ryu, much to Ryu's disbelief, for a friendly master versus student spar in which Gouken is victorious. In his animated ending, Gouken faces Ryu again, finding that his student is being overtaken by the murderous energy, defeats him and suppresses, after which he notices Akuma is in the area. He also appears again in Akuma's animated ending. In this scene, after Ryu has been defeated by Gouken, Akuma appears and challenges his brother to a fight to the death with the winner claiming Ryu. Gouken also reveals that he has reached a new level of mastery known as and has now become even stronger, to the point where Akuma stops his Raging Demon attack after sensing Gouken's power of Nothingness. =Techniques= Goukens special techniques in Street Fighter IV include the , a variation of the Had≈çken projectile techniques which he performs with only one hand, in addition to being able to launch them at an angle and delay their release (he can throw two at the same time as an EX Move as well); the , a technique in which Gouken advances (while passing through attacks and fireballs) towards his opponent in a pose similar to Akuma's Ashura Senkuu pose in Street Fighter EX and attacks with a powerful palm; the , a vertical version of the Tatsumaki Senp≈´ Kyaku; and the . While Gouken doesn't use the Dragon Punch as a regular special technique, his Super Combo is the , while his Ultra Combo is the , which was originally one of Ryus Super Arts from the Street Fighter III games and a Super Combo in Street Fighter Alpha 3. In addition, he also has Ryu's as a second Ultra Combo in Super Street Fighter IV. In other media In addition to his debut in the Masaomi Kanzaki's manga adaptation of Street Fighter II, Gouken also played a role in Masahiko Nakahira's manga adaptations of Street Fighter Alpha and Street Fighter III: Ryu Final, where he appears in flashbacks involving Ryu and Ken's training days. The Alpha manga differs from the back-story of the games in which it was Goutetsu, rather Gouken, who refined their martial art from an art of assassination to a pure martial art. In addition, the manga also established that Gouken forbade Ryu and Ken the use of the Sh≈çry≈´ken. Ryu Final depicts the battle between Gouken and Akuma, which results in the destruction of a forest and the collapse of a hill. The prayer beads worn by Akuma are the same ones that originally belonged to Gouken. Gouken also appears in the Street Fighter episode \\"The World's Greatest Warrior\\", with his character design being similar to those in prior Street Fighter manga. Gouken's role in UDON Entertainment's Street Fighter comic series is much the same as his official story. Gouken raised Ryu, an orphaned boy, in the ways of his martial art. During his training, Gouken committed himself to teaching Ryu only the non- lethal arts, sparing him from the darkness that would come from teaching him the full range of techniques (the side that embraces the Satsui no Had≈ç, or \\"Killing Intent\\"). He also would train the son of an American businessman, Ken Masters, much in the same way. Gouken maintains a difference in philosophy from his brother, Akuma, who believes that the only true mastery comes from training in all facets of their art. This eventually leads to his death during Ryu's absence from the dojo to attend the first Street Fighter tournament. Akuma challenges Gouken to a mortal battle and Gouken is defeated. For the remainder of the comic series, Ryu dedicates himself to forcing out the negativity that wells up within him and adhering to his master's precepts and teachings of humanity and respect for one's opponent. However, he also yearns to avenge Gouken's death and will seek out Akuma at any cost. This all comes to a head at the conclusion of the series (during the third series of comics, Street Fighter II Turbo) when Ryu is attending M. Bison's Street Fighter tournament. Akuma intervenes before the final battle of the tournament between Ryu and Bison and defeats Bison so he may fight Ryu. The two clash but Akuma still overpowers Ryu. Before he can land the final blow, Gouken's spirit is revived and engages a shocked Akuma. The two warriors battle to an unseen conclusion. Japanese actors Akira Koieyama and Shogen Itokazu portrayed older and younger Gouken respectively in the TV series Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist. Reception Ryan Clements from IGN commented that Gouken is one of the best new characters from Street Fighter IV, recommending him highly due to his large number of combos and originality. Cam Shea of IGN AU held similar praise, adding \\"He just exudes power.\\" Randolph Ramsay of GameSpot shared the sentiment, noting that while Gouken had the same fighting style as Ryu and Ken he was unique and powerful. On the other hand, Game Revolution reviewer Nick Tan criticized Gouken's moves for being much stronger than those of many other characters, making evading them almost impossible. GamesRadar mentioned that they want to see a matchup between Gouken and Jinpachi Mishima on their \\"12 matchups we want to see in Street Fighter X Tekken\\" list, exclaiming \\"Roided out Rumble in the retirement home!\\". In 2016, Screen Rant named Gouken the \\"7th Most Powerful Street Fighter Character\\", adding \\"As the master of Ryu and Ken, and the older brother of Akuma, it‚Äôs no surprise that Gouken would be a powerful figure in the Street Fighter universe.\\" In their rankings of Street Fighter characters, Paste ranked Gouken at 54th place, adding \\"He can be an extremely punishing character, but still falls into the crowded shoto category and fails to be a more memorable fighter because of it.\\" Den of Geek ranked Gouken as the \\"37th Best Street Fighter Character\\", stating \\"He‚Äôs like the antithesis of Dan and Sean in that his fighting style differentiates itself from Ryu, Ken, and Akuma, but in a way that makes him appear more masterful. More power and less wasted movement.\\" See also * Sheng Long, a hoax character conceived from a mistranslation in the original Street Fighter II ReferencesBibliography= * * Category:Ansatsuken Category:Fictional Japanese people in video games Category:Fictional judoka Category:Fictional jujutsuka Category:Fictional karateka Category:Fictional kenp≈ç practitioners Category:Fictional martial arts trainers Category:Fictional Shorinji Kempo practitioners Category:Fictional shotokan practitioners Category:Fictional taekwondo practitioners Category:Male characters in video games Category:Street Fighter characters Category:Video game bosses Category:Video game characters in comics Category:Video game characters in film Category:Video game characters in literature Category:Video game characters introduced in 1993 Category:Video game characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:Video game characters with superhuman strength Category:Video game secret characters ","title":"Gouken"},{"id":"1626330","text":"WHDLoad is a software package for the Amiga platform to make installation of software to a hard disk easier, for such things as demos or games. Allowing for better compatibility for Amiga software, which can sometimes have hardware incompatibilities making them hard to use in emulated environments due to the widely varying hardware specifications of the Amiga product line across its history. WHDLoad basically circumvents the operating system in the Amiga for greater compatibility and preserves the original program environment. WHDLoad makes it possible to autostart an installed floppy disk image by clicking an icon. Two special parts are required, each one especially written for the client program: To install media, it must be read from the original disk and written to an image file on the hard drive by the \\"Imager\\". Then the installed program can be run from a virtual disk drive with the \\"Slave\\" interface.  Slave interface  The \\"Slave\\" interface allows interaction between the program and WHDLoad, and co-ordinates the reading and writing of files. This makes it possible to run or emulate programs that are traditionally incompatible with common emulators such as WinFellow, or WinUAE. WHDLoad can be easier to use than trying to figure out the exact configuration for the aforementioned emulators as well.  History  The primary reason for this loader is that a large number of computer games for the Amiga don't properly interact with the AmigaOS operating system, but instead run directly on the Amiga hardware, making assumptions about specific control registers, memory locations, etc. The hardware of newer Amiga models had been greatly revised, causing these assumptions to break when trying to run the same games on newer hardware, and vice versa with newer games on older hardware. WHDLoad provides a way to install such games on an AmigaOS-compatible hard drive and run on newer hardware. An added benefit is the avoidance of loading times and disk swaps, because everything the game needs is stored on the hard drive. The first public release of WHDLoad was on September 5, 1996 and version 18.3 is the latest available in April 2017.  Features  WHDLoad takes over the entire operating system which may cause problems with some software (e.g. TCP/IP stack), but quitting the game or demo restores the system back into its normal working state. WHDLoad games are stored on the AmigaOS file system as disk images, relying on driver files known as \\"WHDLoad slaves\\" to work. These slave files are freely available from the Internet (as Freeware), but the games themselves have to be acquired separately, to prevent software piracy. Additionally, many fans have made their own freeware games, which are also freely, and legally, available. = How WHDLoad works = The WHDLoad \\"Slave\\" interface is integrated into the OS in that you can double click a program icon to run the program at any time. When the user executes the program, by clicking a stored image icon, the AmigaOS operating system loads the WHDLoad executable and starts it. Then the loader checks the software and hardware environment, loads and checks the Slave interface required for that chosen demo or game and allocates required memory for the installed program. If the Preload feature is enabled into the requester page of WHDLoad, then the program attempts to load disk images and files into RAM (insofar as free memory is available). At this point WHDLoad performs its main task of switching off the AmigaOS operating system, disables multitasking and interrupts, and copies memory regions which are used by AmigaOS and required by the installed program to an unused place until the AmigaOS is needed again. WHDLoad also degrades the graphics hardware to OCS on original Amiga machines (this function actually can work also on emulated Amigas, but only on newer versions of WinUAE which recognizes WHDLoad and preserves its interrupts), then WHDLoad initializes all hardware with defined values and jumps into the Slave interface required for the program in question. The Slave interface loads the main executable of the installed program by calling a WHDLoad function (resload_DiskLoad or resload_LoadFile), then patches the main executable (so that the loaded program will be capable of loading its data stored into the hard disk via the Slave, in order to fix compatibility problems, and to enable an exit from the program) and calls the main executable. At this point the program that has been installed can perform the task for which it has been written, loading its data as it would from a real floppy disk. Users can break the execution of the loaded program by way of a \\"Quit\\" key (usually F10). When this action is performed, then the Slave interface returns to WHDLoad by calling a resload_Abort internal function. The OS will be restored with all hardware registers and original display. The memory and all allocated resources are left free for any further usage.  Requirements  A standard Amiga 1200 or Amiga 600 without any extra memory, will only work with a limited number of games. Which usually means games using OCS/ECS and one floppy disk. It is recommended to install either a or RAM Board in the trapdoor slot to ensure compatibility for 99% of the games. A harddisk is required, the number of games that can be installed depend on the size of the harddisk.

Driver creates the majority of the album artwork associated with these bands, performs the lead vocals and several instruments, produces the albums, and has written and arranged the music for both bands. Although several members of motW continued on when the band dissolved and reformed as Kayo Dot in 2003, Driver is the only remaining member of the original line-up of maudlin of the Well who is still consistently active with Kayo Dot.  Biography and early work  Toby Driver was born in 1978, in Meriden, Connecticut and currently resides in New York City. He learned clarinet and piano from a young age, and during his high school years, he recorded several albums under the moniker \\"Spoonion\\" using tape recorders and a karaoke machine. He later released his favorite cuts of these albums online as collections.Spoonion. After playing with a handful of bands in high school, including a Nirvana and Jane's Addiction cover band, and a gothic-progressive-metal band called \\"Celestial Providence,\\" Driver formed maudlin of the Well with his friends Jason Byron and Greg Massi and recorded a demo entitled Through Languid Veins (1996) He attended Hampshire College in Amherst, MA, where he expanded maudlin of the Well, and where they recorded their second (Begat of the Haunted Oak... An Acorn), third (Odes to Darksome Spring), and fourth (For My Wife) demos which turned into their debut album My Fruit Psychobells... A Seed Combustible. During this time, Driver also studied under composer and jazz legend, Yusef Lateef, and composed, directed, and performed an oratorio for 20 musicians based on and titled after the epic poem Six Trillion Miles Before the First by Jason Byron. Sections of this piece later reappeared on motW's reunion album, Part the Second (2009).  Style and musicianship  As evident in the bands and projects to which Driver has contributed, he generally utilizes unconventional styles of song-writing and song structure. Many songs he writes use odd time signatures, range from ten to twenty minutes in length, divert from typical riff-based structure, and employ elements of many musical genres, often shifting between these styles within the same song. Songs often incorporate musical qualities suited to styles as diverse as death metal, minimalism, chamber music, post-rock and jazz, while seldom completely conforming to any one specific genre. Driver has repeatedly denied any connection of his music to jazz, minimalism or improv. His work is strictly composed and rehearsed thoroughly, and the songs seldom see any changes after being recorded. Driver's vocals are accordingly diverse in range and style. Driver uses a normal singing voice, screams, shouts, occasionally uses death vocals (not to be confused with former band member Jason Byron who contributes vocals in early motW also), as well as occasionally singing falsetto and using spoken word (see Kayo Dot's Choirs of the Eye and Hubardo for an example of all the styles listed above). A multi- instrumentalist, Toby Driver is credited on various albums as playing the following instruments: *guitar (acoustic and electric) *12-string guitar *baritone guitar *bass *double bass *various keyboards including piano, organ and synthesizer *laptop mellotron *clarinet *cello *bells *percussion *gamelan  Bands  maudlin of the Well = Driver was a founding member of maudlin of the Well in 1996 along with Jason Byron and Greg Massi. They morphed into Kayo Dot in 2003 during the process of recording what would have been motW's fourth album, and titled Kayo Dot's henceforth first album Choirs of the Eye, due to label problems and the desire to move away from being pigeonholed in the metal scene. In 2009, due to fan requests and contributions, Driver, along with Terran Olson who was also still playing with Kayo Dot, reformed maudlin of the Well to record the digital album Part the Second, reuniting with guitarists Greg Massi, Josh Seipp-Williams, and drummer Sam Gutterman. The album contained five newly released songs, some of which were composed‚Äîpartially at least‚Äîin the early days of the band (as far back as 1997), with lyrics co-written by Jason Byron and Toby Driver.motW ‚Äì Part the Second notes. Maudlin of the Well's style was always described by the band as \\"astral metal,\\" referencing Driver and Byron's interest in astral projection. Driver has stated that he used astral projection and lucid dreaming as methods to retrieve music from the subconscious. Maudlin of the Well's lyrics deal with this topic, as well as the subjects of ghosts and the paranormal, the occult, kabbalah, nostalgia, and betrayal. The liner notes for their companion albums, Bath and Leaving Your Body Map (2001) contain a puzzle that leads to an as-yet-unknown solution. = Kayo Dot = Kayo Dot is Driver's main band, which began in 2003 and remains currently active. They have released eight full-length albums, an EP, a few live recordings, and a handful of remixes and singles. Kayo Dot's musical style shifts constantly, but maintains a ubiquitous aesthetic of darkness, surrealism, impressionism, hallucination, melodrama, and musical technicality. Driver is the only consistent member, although some members who have left the band in the past have returned for recordings or special live performances. Kayo Dot has an active touring schedule, averaging four months on the road per year, and having joined bands such as Pallbearer, Earth, Pelican, and Secret Chiefs 3 on tour. Kayo Dot has worked with several record labels including John Zorn's Tzadik, Robotic Empire, Holy Roar, Aaron Turner's Hydra Head Records, Antithetic Records, The Flenser, and Driver's own imprint, Ice Level Music. = Piggy Black Cross = Piggy Black Cross is Driver's \\"Dark Industrial IDM\\" https://www.facebook.com/piggyblackcross/ project with vocalist Bridget Bellavia. Thus far, they have released their music only digitally, first appearing on SoundCloud in March 2018. SputnikMusic.com has called it \\"a surreal, engrossing debut.\\" https://www.sputnikmusic.com/soundoff.php?albumid=297868 = Tartar Lamb I and II = Driver formed the side project Tartar Lamb with Mia Matsumiya in 2006. Tartar Lamb did a brief US and Canada tour in January of that year, and later recorded their album, Sixty Metonymies, with Randall Dunn in Seattle, Washington in December 2006 in the middle of another difficult winter tour. Sixty Metonymies was self-released on CD by Driver on his label, Ice Level Music. Since then, Sixty Metonymies has only been performed occasionally at local concerts in New York City when possible. Tartar Lamb II was created in 2009 with other members of Kayo Dot and composer and clarinetist Jeremiah Cymerman. It was named a Tartar Lamb project because the compositional method that Driver invented for Sixty Metonymies was used again for the new work, which was called Polyimage of Known Exits. This incarnation of Tartar Lamb did a month-long European winter tour in 2010 opening up for Kayo Dot. A recording from this tour appears on the Kayo Dot/Tartar Lamb II live album, Krak√≥w (2011). Tartar Lamb II also performed locally in New York City on a couple occasions but the band is currently defunct. = Vaura = Driver also currently plays bass in the band Vaura, who released their debut album Selenelion, in 2012 through Wierd Records and their second album, The Missing, in 2013 via Profound Lore Records. The band is fronted by writer, philosopher, Blacklist singer and Azar Swan producer, Joshua Strawn, and also includes guitarist Kevin Hufnagel of Dysrhythmia and Gorguts, and drummer Charlie Schmid. The style of Vaura is an amalgam of gothic rock, progressive black- metal, and pop. = Stern = Driver plays guitar in Stern, the experimental alien pop band auteured by the prolific composer, filmmaker, and writer Chuck Stern (formerly of Time of Orchids). The band also includes former Time of Orchids and Kayo Dot drummer Keith Abrams, and frequent Driver collaborator Tim Byrnes. Stern has released three albums as a solo act, and three more with the full band including Driver: Entitlement (2012), Bone Turquoise (2015), and Missive: Sister Ships (2018). For more information, visit: http://stern.band. = Solo work = Driver has also been prolific as a solo act, releasing his eponymous debut In the L..L..Library Loft on John Zorn's Tzadik in 2005. In the L..L..Library Loft features four compositions in a modern classical style including guitars, drumsets, and screaming vocals. Driver composed and recorded Ichneumonidae to accompany a butoh dance performance in 2012; this was also released on Ice Level Music. Driver's next eponymous album was 2017's Madonnawhore, which contains six long, spacious, and slow sombre ballads and features drummer Keith Abrams. In the fall of 2017, Driver was commissioned to compose a piece entitled Through the Arm to Magma for the Krak√≥w-based chamber orchestra Sp√≥≈Çdzielnia Muzyczna for the 2017 Sacrum Profanum Festival, which also featured composers Stephen O'Malley, Aaron Turner, Jennifer Walshe, Alvin Lucier, Iancu Dumitrescu, Ana-Maria Avram, and many others. In 2018, Driver released a second album of ballads, entitled They Are the Shield, featuring violinists Pauline Kim Harris and Conrad Harris, pianist Kelly Moran, and drummer Brian Chase from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, on Blood Music. Driver has also done a small amount of soundtrack work, including for Eric Pennycoff's short film The Pod and Kevin Endres' short film, Lazaretto. Driver‚Äôs composition, Stained Glass, was used in an installation film piece of the same title by artist Peter Hopkins Miller. Stained Glass was a featured exhibition in the 2017 Biennale di Venezia. = Bloodmist = Driver plays bass in the free- improvised trio Bloodmist, which is led by composer, clarinetist, and producer Jeremiah Cymerman and also features composer, guitarist, synthesist, and producer Mario Diaz de Leon. Bloodmist performs occasionally around New York City, and has released one album entitled Sheen on Cymerman's imprint 5049 Records, with another forthcoming in 2019. = Sideman Work and Small Collaborations = Driver has also toured as the bassist of Trey Spruance's Secret Chiefs 3 for many years, has recorded vocals with Asva, Tusk, played vibraphone and clarinet for Gregor Samsa, has toured as bassist for Myrkur, has remixed for Pyramids, Candiria, and Bloody Panda, has formed more casual bands such as Clefter with Gyan Riley and Timba Harris, or Tanks with Ches Smith and Brandon Seabrook, and regularly performs around New York City with local musicians.  Ice Level Music  Driver owns and operates the record label, Ice Level Music, which was initially created to release Tartar Lamb's 2007 debut, Sixty Metonymies, but continues to be an outlet for Driver to self-release some of his own material. Ice Level Music's discography includes Tartar Lamb - Sixty Metonymies and Polyimage of Known Exits, maudlin of the Well- Part the Second, Kayo Dot- Gamma Knife, Hubardo, and the vinyl edition of Choirs of the Eye, Ichneumonidae, and others.

Overview  Rangers played a total of 51 competitive matches during the 2004‚Äì05 season. They went into the season looking to recapture their Scottish Premier League crown, which Celtic had won the season before. Manager Alex McLeish made several summer signings, with the signature of Frenchman Jean- Alain Boumsong being his biggest coup. Others included strikers Dado Prso and Nacho Novo, as well as the experienced midfielder Alex Rae and future Ibrox favourite Marvin Andrews. Rangers League form began poorly picking up only 8 points from their first 5 matches. Rangers lost the first Old Firm derby of the season 1‚Äì0 at Celtic Park and fell behind Celtic in the league. Rangers form improved following the loss to Celtic and they weren't to lose again in the league until April. This run of form included two wins over Celtic in November, once in the League Cup and the other in the League. They also ended a poor run of results at Celtic Park, with a 2‚Äì0 victory in February. A 2‚Äì1 loss to Celtic at home in April left Rangers five points behind with just four games left of the season. Celtic led by two points on the final day of the season and were winning 1‚Äì0 against Motherwell, but two late goals for Motherwell coupled with Rangers 1‚Äì0 win over Hibernian saw Rangers win the title, Helicopter Sunday. Rangers also won the League Cup this season, with a 5‚Äì1 victory over Motherwell in the final. Rangers were beaten in the Scottish Cup however, losing 2‚Äì1 to Celtic in the third round. After losing to CSKA Moscow in the third qualifying round of the Champions League, Rangers entered the UEFA Cup. Rangers managed to qualify for the newly formed group stages with a penalty shoot-out win over Maritimo.

It provided well logging and well perforating services to both domestic and international customers. Gearhart was usually supported by national oil companies as a way of containing Schlumberger monopolies. Early days Gearhart and Owen had been employees of Welex Jet Services, also located in Fort Worth. Gearhart had been the Chief Logging Engineer while Owen was the Chief Explosives Engineer. It was Welex who had developed the explosive lined shaped charge used for well perforation. As now competitors to Welex, GO was unable to buy perforating charges and in turn developed their own, with a lawsuit by Welex being the result. In 1962, the court's ruling went in favor of GO, but only after the United States Justice Department stepped in and eased the apparent constraint of trade. Being forced to manufacture their own perforating line was apparently a positive step for GO, as they grew to be the largest supplier of jet charges in the world. The Perforating Supply Company (PSC) was formed as a subsidiary of GO, and made perforating supplies readily available to other independent wireline companies. Over the next six years, many perforating companies were started, with GO providing both the technical and financial aid. In 1964, GO bought Electronic Instruments and the company's name was soon changed to Gearhart- Owen Industries (GOI). Later acquisitions included Widco Mandrel Industries, Pengo Manufacturing, Peterson Engineering, and Well Reconnaissance. It was during this period that GO built an ordnance facility at Cleburne, Texas for the manufacture of fuses and warheads for bombs and torpedoes. In July, 1973, three explosions at the GO ordnance plant injured 29 people and left three dead. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s GO was slowly built by selling cased-hole logging and perforating services and equipment also known as completion services. This operation is accomplished by way of a cable containing electrical conductors, called a wireline. The wireline is attached on the bottom end to various tools and sensors and on the upper end to a hoist unit. The hoist units are in turn mounted in trucks for mobility. With this requirement at hand, along with both the sensor tools and perforating supplies, Gearhart manufactured trucks at its Fort Worth facility. Its products were made for both in-house use and for sale to other independents. The company's domestic field operations were handled by its wholly owned subsidiary, GO Wireline from locations throughout the US while the foreign operations fell under GO International, SA. Hi-tech By the early 1970s with Harrold Owen going in the direction of explosive manufacturing, Marvin Gearhart had decided that he wanted to crack the lucrative open-hole logging market that was dominated by Schlumberger, Dresser-Atlas, and Welex. In 1972, Gearhart began development of a new series of open hole tools and computer system to analyze the findings. In only 14 months the system was completed and entered its test phase. The new Direct Digital Logging (DDL) system surpassed by leaps and bounds the current analog systems employed by its competition and went into service in 1975 creating large revenues for the company. Measure While Drilling During the 1970s while GO was developing other new technologies and breaking into markets, which included Venezuela, Africa, and the North Sea, the domestic oil and gas business was starting to escalate. With a fleet of wireline units that now numbered in the hundreds, Gearhart continued to branch out and had visions of a company that offered a complete package. GO wanted to offer energy producers a line of services that included wireline services, perforating, drilling services, core analysis, seismic services and so on. Fort Worth had now become a research and development center. Gearhart researchers were concentrating on a new technology called Measure While Drilling (MWD). This new product was being developed for market by the same team that had given life to DDL earlier. MWD was what made controlled directional horizontal drilling possible. MWD saved time and money over the traditional methods of wireline logging by eliminating the wireline. After a few years of testing, Gearhart and its Canadian affiliate, Computalog, were gaining advances over their competition. Sale For its part, by 1983 Gearhart was enjoying the best growth in the company's history. With operations now stretching not only across North America, but also the Middle East, Africa, East Asia, South America, and the North Sea, Gearhart now commanded international respect. From 1977 to 1981, it had grown from annual revenues of $55 million to $240 million and recording 28 consecutive years of growth. From 1976 to 1979, Gearhart-Owen was the fastest growing company on the New York Stock Exchange. MWD had now become a process desired by competing companies. By 1983, as an investment, General Electric had bought 25% of Gearhart's stock with rumors of a total buyout of the company. Marvin Gearhart was excited about that possible move, however, it was not to be. Instead, GE informed him that its shares in the company had been sold to Smith International, a competitor to some of Gearhart's divisions. Smith now made a move to buy just enough stock to gain control of the company. Gearhart decided to fight that move, at first through unsuccessful court appeals and later by acquiring the large geophysical company, Geosource. Geosource's size rivaled Gearhart's and the merger indebted Gearhart to the point it was no longer attractive to Smith. Although Gearhart had record revenues of $560 million in 1985, the money-losing habit of Geosource prevented a recovery. When the bottom fell out of the market in 1986, Gearhart had record revenues of over $670 million, employed well over 10,000 people worldwide, and had become the world's third largest wireline logging company. After over 30 years of fulfilling his dream, Marvin Gearhart's company was up for sale. Late in 1987, its Canadian partner Computalog had signed a letter of intent with Gearhart providing for the possible restructuring and whole acquisition of the company. By February of the following year, it was ready and told the Gearhart management of the plan. On February 24, 1988, it was announced that Gearhart was entering into a buyout agreement with oilfield service giant Halliburton Company. Within Halliburton, it was merged with Welex Jet Services to become Halliburton Logging Services completing the circle which began 33 years earlier. Also, Halliburton later in 1993-94' also acquired the division of Smith International, DataDril, that was to have originally been combined with Gearhart's MWD division. Pengo Throughout the 1970s friction began to develop between the two men who had before almost always agreed on everything. Gearhart did not like selling torpedoes and hand grenade fuses to the military, but there were also other disagreements about the future direction of GO. In 1978, Marvin Gearhart and Harold Owen parted company with Owen taking the non-wireline share of the company, this included PSC and the ordnance facility. This new company that used the name Pengo Industries was also located in Fort Worth and agreed not to compete for three years. Computalog By 1976 with his new DDL technology and his lead in innovative open hole solutions, Marvin Gearhart was looking for ways to expand his company and gain a step on industry giant Schlumberger. Open hole was where the money was. It was where drillers decided to go ahead with further production. Gearhart looked to the north and Canada for an answer. The Canadian open hole market was then controlled by just a couple of companies. Gearhart met with several Canadian firms to set up a possible partnership. It was a struggle but Gearhart struck a deal in 1976 with a merger of one of Gearhart's former clients called Perfco and Wireline Electronics. This new partnership would be called Computalog Services and be headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. Perfco and GO were now in the digital wireline open hole business with a domination of the Canadian market ahead of them. For the next several years Computalog, under CEO Walter Dawson, operated basically as an independent company with promising success. It was combined with the cased hole services and the name was changed to Computalog Wireline. The Canadian employees were sent to Fort Worth for training on the new system. After a couple of years in the planning, it was decided in 1980 to make the company go public with another name change to Computalog Gearhart, Ltd. In spite of unstable business situations due to continued debates in Ottawa over the National Energy Program (NEP), the company made financial strides with revenues of $10 million while Gearhart made $150 million. With the NEP decided by 1981, the Canadian service companies took a beating and many of them fell. Gearhart Computalog took advantage of this and introduced its new MWD technology to Canada. It was met with skepticism but eventually, with acquisition of two drilling companies, Computalog became the leader and had great success. Computalog was putting every new system that Gearhart could develop to good use. A new data transmittal system called COMSTAR went into service allowing well data to be transmitted by way of satellite from the well to Computalog headquarters for analysis by engineers without having to be on site. By 1985 with acquisitions and new business, Computalog's revenues had almost reached $100 million annually. In 1986, due to lower prices from non- OPEC producers and political problems in the Middle East, OPEC increased production rates causing a world glut and the resultant drop in prices. The oil service industry again fell on its collective face. Computalog's employees made concessions which proved successful. Gearhart did not fare so well. Computalog was making the most of the technology being supplied by Gearhart and helped shore the Texas parent. In spite of improving conditions in the US, Gearhart was still in financial straits. Gearhart divested itself of many of its holdings leaving it with only a 4.5% ownership of Computalog. It had now lost $337 million and was a prime candidate for buyout. Computalog had now become one of the companies interested. It was not to be and Computalog had now lost its main supply of technology. The Gearhart connection had ended its 12-year run. Today Although given a token board position, Marvin Gearhart left the company soon after the Halliburton merger to concentrate on another project, Rockbit Industries, which became Gearhart-Rockbit. In the early 2000s, after the expiration of his non-competition clause with Halliburton, Marvin Gearhart began another new company dedicated to well logging. It is also called Gearhart Industries, and is located across the street from the old facility in Fort Worth, Texas.

He also performs as a musician under the alias Kupek. Career O'Malley at ComicCon in 2010. Bryan Lee O'Malley attended St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Secondary School in London, Ontario, Canada. He went on to start in Film Studies at the University of Western Ontario, but dropped out before completing. Prior to having his own material published, O'Malley illustrated the Oni Press miniseries Hopeless Savages: Ground Zero, written by Jen Van Meter. He also lettered many Oni comics, including the majority of Chynna Clugston's output between 2002 and 2005. His first original graphic novel was Lost at Sea, released by Oni Press in 2003. Lost at Sea is a coming-of-age story about a shy 18-year-old girl named Raleigh, who believes her soul was stolen by a cat, and the road trip she takes across the United States with several teens from her school that she barely knows. From 2004 to 2010, O'Malley worked on the six-volume Scott Pilgrim series, published by Oni Press in digest size black and white books. The series was a critical and commercial success, spawning a full-color re- release, a 2010 film adaptation, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, a video game adaptation, and a number of official soundtracks. O'Malley created the cover art work for the 2012 video game Fez. In July 2014, his graphic novel Seconds was released by Ballantine Books. In mid 2016, O'Malley revealed the title of his next major graphic novel Worst World, which currently has no release date. He is also the co-creator of the ongoing comic book Snotgirl with Leslie Hung. He is officially billed as its writer. Personal life O'Malley is half Korean and half French-Canadian. In 2004, O'Malley married fellow cartoonist Hope Larson. They lived together in Toronto in 2004, Halifax in 2005, North Carolina from 2008 to 2010, and Los Angeles. They divorced in 2014.

They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers. They are a topic of ongoing controversy, as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon. Accordingly, a formal acceptance of myofascial \\"knots\\" as an identifiable source of pain is more common among bodyworkers, physical therapists, chiropractors, and osteopathic practitioners. Nonetheless, the concept of trigger points provides a framework which may be used to help address certain musculoskeletal pain. The trigger point model states that unexplained pain frequently radiates from these points of local tenderness to broader areas, sometimes distant from the trigger point itself. Practitioners claim to have identified reliable referred pain patterns which associate pain in one location with trigger points elsewhere. There is variation in the methodology for diagnosis of trigger points and a dearth of theory to explain how they arise and why they produce specific patterns of referred pain. Compression of a trigger point may elicit local tenderness, referred pain, or local twitch response. The local twitch response is not the same as a muscle spasm. This is because a muscle spasm refers to the entire muscle contracting whereas the local twitch response also refers to the entire muscle but only involves a small twitch, no contraction. Among physicians, various specialists might use trigger point therapy. These include physiatrists (physicians specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation), family medicine, and orthopedics. Osteopathic as well as chiropractic schools also include trigger points in their training. Other health professionals, such as athletic trainers, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, acupuncturists, massage therapists and structural integrators are also aware of these ideas and many of them make use of trigger points in their clinical work as well.  Signs and symptoms  The term \\"trigger point\\" was coined in 1942 by Dr. Janet Travell to describe a clinical finding with the following characteristics: * Pain related to a discrete, irritable point in skeletal muscle or fascia, not caused by acute local trauma, inflammation, degeneration, neoplasm or infection. * The painful point can be felt as a nodule or band in the muscle, and a twitch response can be elicited on stimulation of the trigger point. * Palpation of the trigger point reproduces the patient's complaint of pain, and the pain radiates in a distribution of the muscle and/or nerve. Patients can have a trigger point in their upper trapezius and when compressed feel pain in their forearm, hand and fingers (S. Goldfinch)  Pathophysiology  Activation of trigger points may be caused by a number of factors, including acute or chronic muscle overload, activation by other trigger points (key/satellite, primary/secondary), disease, psychological distress (via systemic inflammation), homeostatic imbalances, direct trauma to the region, collision trauma (such as a car crash which stresses many muscles and causes instant trigger points), radiculopathy, infections and health issues such as smoking. Trigger points form only in muscles. They form as a local contraction in a small number of muscle fibers in a larger muscle or muscle bundle. These in turn can pull on tendons and ligaments associated with the muscle and can cause pain deep within a joint where there are no muscles. The integrated hypothesis theory states that trigger points form from excessive release of acetylcholine which produces sustained depolarization of muscle fibers. Indeed, the trigger point has an abnormal biochemical composition with elevated concentrations of acetylcholine, noradrenaline and serotonin and a lower pH. These sustained contractions of muscle sarcomeres compresses local blood supply restricting the energy needs of the local region. This crisis of energy produces sensitizing substances that interact with some nociceptive (pain) nerves traversing in the local region which in turn can produce localized pain within the muscle at the neuromuscular junction (Travell and Simons 1999). When trigger points are present in muscles there is often pain and weakness in the associated structures. These pain patterns in muscles follow specific nerve pathways and have been readily mapped to allow for identification of the causative pain factor. Many trigger points have pain patterns that overlap, and some create reciprocal cyclic relationships that need to be treated extensively to remove them.  Diagnosis  Practitioners do not agree on what constitutes a trigger point, but the assessment typically considers symptoms, pain patterns and manual palpation. Usually there is a taut band in muscles containing trigger points, and a hard nodule can be felt. Often a twitch response can be felt in the muscle by running your finger perpendicular to the muscle's direction; this twitch response often activates the \\"all or nothing\\" response in a muscle that causes it to contract. Pressing on an affected muscle can often refer pain. Clusters of trigger points are not uncommon in some of the larger muscles, such as the gluteus group (gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus). Often there is a heat differential in the local area of a trigger point. A 2007 review of diagnostic criteria used in studies of trigger points concluded that : \\"there is as yet limited consensus on case definition in respect of MTrP pain syndrome. Further research is needed to test the reliability and validity of diagnostic criteria. Until reliable diagnostic criteria have been established, there is a need for greater transparency in research papers on how a case of MTrP pain syndrome is defined, and claims for effective interventions in treating the condition should be viewed with caution.\\" A 2009 review of nine studies examining the reliability of trigger point diagnosis found that physical examination could not be recommended as reliable for the diagnosis of trigger points. = Imaging = Since the early 2000s several research studies have been conducted to determine if there was a way to visualize myofascial trigger points using tools such as ultrasound imaging and magnetic resonance elastography. Several of these studies have been dismissed under meta- analysis. Another synthetic literature review expressed more optimism about the validity of imaging for myofascial trigger points, but admitted small sample sizes of the reviewed studies. = Myofascial pain syndrome = Myofascial pain syndrome is a focal hyperirritability in muscle that can strongly modulate central nervous system functions. Scholars distinguish this from fibromyalgia, which is characterized by widespread pain and tenderness and is described as a central augmentation of nociception giving rise to deep tissue tenderness that includes muscles. Myofascial pain is associated with muscle tenderness that arises from trigger points, focal points of tenderness, a few millimeters in diameter, found at multiple sites in a muscle and the fascia of muscle tissue. Biopsy tests found that trigger points were hyperirritable and electrically active muscle spindles in general muscle tissue. Full open-access article = Misdiagnosis of pain = The misdiagnosis of pain is the most important issue taken up by Travell and Simons. Referred pain from trigger points mimics the symptoms of a very long list of common maladies, but physicians, in weighing all the possible causes for a given condition, rarely consider a myofascial source. The study of trigger points has not historically been part of medical education. Travell and Simons hold that most of the common everyday pain is caused by myofascial trigger points and that ignorance of that basic concept could inevitably lead to false diagnoses and the ultimate failure to deal effectively with pain. TreatmentPhysical muscle treatment= Therapists may use myotherapy (deep pressure as in Bonnie Prudden's approach, massage or tapotement as in Dr. Griner's approach), mechanical vibration, pulsed ultrasound, electrostimulation, ischemic compression, trigger-point-injection (see below), dry-needling, \\"spray-and-stretch\\" using a cooling spray (vapocoolant), low- level laser therapy and stretching techniques that invoke reciprocal inhibition within the musculoskeletal system. Practitioners may use elbows, feet or various tools to direct pressure directly upon the trigger point, to avoid overuse of their hands. A successful treatment protocol relies on identifying trigger points, resolving them and, if all trigger points have been deactivated, elongating the structures affected along their natural range of motion and length. In the case of muscles, which is where most treatment occurs, this involves stretching the muscle using combinations of passive, active, active isolated (AIS), muscle energy techniques (MET), and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching to be effective. Fascia surrounding muscles should also be treated to elongate and resolve strain patterns, otherwise muscles will simply be returned to positions where trigger points are likely to re-develop. The results of manual therapy are related to the skill level of the therapist. If trigger points are pressed too short a time, they may activate or remain active; if pressed too long or hard, they may be irritated or the muscle may be bruised, resulting in pain in the area treated. This bruising may last for a 1‚Äì3 days after treatment, and may feel like, but is not similar to, delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), the pain felt days after overexerting muscles. Pain is also common after a massage if the practitioner uses pressure on unnoticed latent or active trigger points, or is not skilled in myofascial trigger point therapy. Researchers of evidence-based medicine concluded as of 2001 that evidence for the usefulness of trigger points in the diagnosis of fibromyalgia is thin. More recently, an association has been made between fibromyalgia tender points and active trigger points. =Trigger-point-injection= Injections without anesthetics, or dry needling, and injections including saline, local anesthetics such as procaine hydrochloride (Novocain) or articaine without vasoconstrictors like epinephrine,Raab D: Craniomandibular disorders simulating odontalgia and Eustachian tube -disorders ‚Äì a case report. [Durch craniomandibul√§re Dysfunktionen vorget√§uschte Zahnschmerzen und Tubenfunktionsst√∂rungen ‚Äì ein Fallbericht.] Wehrmedizinische Monatsschrift 2015: 59(12); 396-401. http://www.wehrmed.de/article/2738-durch-craniomandibulaere-dysfunktionen- vorgetaeuschte-zahnschmerzen-tubenfunktionsstoerungen-ein-fallbericht.html steroids, and botulinum toxin provide more immediate relief and can be effective when other methods fail. In regards to injections with anesthetics, a low concentration, short acting local anesthetic such as procaine 0.5% without steroids or epinephrine is recommended. High concentrations or long acting local anesthetics as well as epinephrine can cause muscle necrosis, while use of steroids can cause tissue damage. Despite the concerns about long acting agents, a mixture of lidocaine and marcaine is often used. A mixture of 1 part 2% lidocaine with 3 parts 0.5% bupivacaine (trade name:Marcaine) provides 0.5% lidocaine and 0.375% bupivacaine. This has the advantages of immediate anesthesia with lidocaine during injection to minimize injection pain while providing a longer duration of action with a lowered concentration of bupivacaine. In 1979, a study by Czech physician Karl Lewit reported that dry needling had the same success rate as anesthetic injections for the treatment of trigger points. He dubbed this the 'needle effect'. In the 1950s and 1960s, studies relevant to trigger points were done by J. H. Kellgren at University College Hospital, London, in the 1930s and, independently, by Michael Gutstein in Berlin and Michael Kelly in Australia. Health insurance companies in the US such as Blue Cross, Medica, and HealthPartners began covering trigger point injections in 2005. =Risks= Treatment, whether by self or by a professional, has some inherent dangers. It may lead to damage of soft tissue and other organs. The trigger points in the upper quadratus lumborum, for instance, are very close to the kidneys and poorly administered treatment (particularly injections) may lead to kidney damage. Likewise, treating the masseter muscle may damage the salivary glands superficial to this muscle. Furthermore, some experts believe trigger points may develop as a protective measure against unstable joints. =Efficacy= Studies to date on the efficacy of dry needling for MTrPs and pain have been too small to be conclusive.  Overlap with acupuncture  In a June 2000 review, Chang-Zern Hong correlates the MTrP \\"tender points\\" to acupunctural \\"ah shi\\" (\\"Oh Yes!\\") points, and the \\"local twitch response\\" to acupuncture's \\"de qi\\" (\\"needle sensation\\"), based on a 1977 paper by Melzack et al. Peter Dorsher comments on a strong correlation between the locations of trigger points and classical acupuncture points, finding that 92% of the 255 trigger points correspond to acupuncture points, including 79.5% with similar pain indications. History In the 19th century, British physician George William Balfour, German anatomist Robert Froriep, and the German physician Strauss described pressure-sensitive, painful knots in muscles, sometimes called myofascial trigger points through retrospective diagnosis. The concept was popularized in the US in the middle of the 20th century by the American physician Janet G. Travell.

During the 12th century, the Fitz Alan family of Clun occupied the manor house, with John Le Strange acquiring it around 1165. In 1234, Myddle was the location of the signing of a treaty between King Henry III and Welsh Prince Llewellyn. In September 2005 and September 2007 a detectorist uncovered a small number of hammered gold coins dating back to the 14th century.More gold coins from the Myddle Hoard, Shropshire  Treasure Hunting The Le Strange's dynasty ended in 1580 due to the lack of male heirs to the estate, and Myddle passed to the Earl of Derby after he married Joan Le Strange. Their son, Thomas, became the second Earl of Derby. Elizabeth I granted Thomas Barnston a licence to sell land in Myddle in 1596, and in 1600 Sir Thomas Egerton purchased the village. Egerton's son was created by James I the first Earl of Bridgewater in 1579. During the English Civil War in 1642, Charles I recruited 20 men from Myddle, with 14 killed.Myddle, Shropshire, England ‚Äì History Myddle suffered an earthquake in 1688, but continued to expand throughout the coming centuries, with butchers' shops, taverns, fishmongers and masons inhabiting the village by about 1850. In 1901 the village was graced by a visit of The All American Trumpeters who put on a free show to raise funds for a memorial to Queen Victoria. The manor house was destroyed and sold to pay the death duties of the third Earl Brownlow in 1924. In 1942, during the Second World War, an RAF Whitley bomber crashed in Myddle after taking off from nearby Sleap Airfield. Myddle Castle Myddle Castle ruins A castle was constructed in Myddle between 1308 and 1310 by Lord John Le Strange as a stronghold against the Welsh after the family obtained a licence to convert the manor house into a castle. Sometime around 1449, Elizabeth Cobham received the castle as part of her dowery from Richard, 7th Lord Strange. After Lord Strange died, Cobham married Sir Roger Kynaston in 1450. Elizabeth died in 1453, and left the castle to Kynaston. Upon Roger's death in 1495, his son Humphrey Kynaston inherited the castle, but allowed it to fall into disrepair, and abandoned it some time later. The castle has stood empty since the 16th century, with one visitor to the village, John Leland, describing the castle as around 1540. The castle collapsed during the 1688 earthquake. The castle was repaired by John Hume Egerton in 1849,Myddle, Shropshire, England ‚Äì History who inscribed his name into a block in the castle's wall.

It is an agile breed of light draught horse build. All Fjord horses are dun in colour, with five variations in shade recognised in the breed standard. One of the world's oldest breeds, it has been used for hundreds of years as a farm horse in Norway, and in modern times is popular for its generally good temperament. It is used both as a harness horse and under saddle. Breed characteristics A Fjord horse with typical build The Fjord horse has a distinct appearance. The breed's conformation differs from many other breeds in that it is a blend of draught horse muscling and bone, with smaller size and greater agility. It has a strong, arched neck, sturdy legs and good feet, and a compact, muscular body. The head is medium-sized and well defined with a broad, flat forehead and a straight or slightly dished face, with small ears and large eyes. Despite its small size, the breed is fully capable of carrying an adult human and pulling heavy loads. The hair coat becomes particularly heavy and thick in the winter. The natural mane is long, thick, and heavy, but is usually clipped in a distinctive crescent shape to between five and ten centimetres (two to four inches) so that it stands straight up and emphasises the shape of the neck.\\"About the Breed\\", published by Norwegian Fjord Horse Registry. Web site accessed 7 December 2009 This roached mane is thought to make for easier grooming. It also accentuates the horse's strong neck and full-length dorsal stripe. There is some feathering on the lower legs; however, the breed standard discourages profuse feathering. There is no upper or lower limit for height set for the breed, but heights between at the withers are recommended.Styret i Norsk Hestesenter (7 June 2020).

Though some individuals may fall under the traditional cutoff between horses and ponies, the Fjord horse is considered a horse, regardless of height. Fjord horses have a reputation for a generally good temperament. =Colour= Mare and foal of slightly different shades All Fjord horses are dun.\\"The Colours of the Norwegian Fjordhorse\\", accessed 23 January 2012 Dun is a body colour that is a tan, gold or related shade with darker (usually black or dark brown) points and primitive markings. The breed standard recognises five shade variations.NFHR Breed standard accessed 3 December 2009 These shades have been officially recognised in Norway since 1922. The hooves are most often dark, but can be a lighter brown colour on lighter-coloured horses. The dun colour itself is a dominant dilution gene. All Fjord horses are dun; therefore they are homozygous or nearly so for dun colouration. No equine coat colour genetics studies have been done specifically on Fjord horses. But, if Fjord horses were not homozygous for the dun gene, then a dark-coloured, non-dun individual could occasionally occur in the breed. However, this is very rare or nonexistent today; dark cropouts existed in the past, but breed standardisation has favoured duns and the colour is now produced consistently. Two-toned mane, showing black midtstol, characteristic of the breed. The primitive markings associated with the dun gene are often quite vivid in the Fjord horse. These include the dorsal stripe, darker mane and tail, horizontal stripes on the back of the forearms, and, in rare cases, transverse striping across the withers. Some Fjord horses have small brown spots on the body or the head. These spots are called \\"Njal marks\\" after one of the foundation sires of the contemporary Fjord horse, who had such markings. Fjord horses are also consistent for having pangare traits: lighter hair on the muzzle, belly, inside of legs, and over the eyes. Some Fjord horses also carry the cream gene, which combines with the dun gene to create the lighter shades of the breed. Fjord horses have a significant amount of lighter hairs on the outside edges of the mane and edges of the tail, and when teamed with the darker- coloured centre of the mane common to most colour shades gives a two-toned look that is more dramatic than seen in dun horses of other breeds. Among Fjord horse aficionados, the dark section of hair in the middle of the mane and the darker hair in the middle of the tail, are described by the Norwegian terms midtstol and halefj√¶r, respectively. White markings on Fjord horses are rare, but have been noted as long as written records have been kept of the breed. A small star is acceptable, but any other white or pink markings are considered undesirable. Norges Fjordhestlag (The Norwegian Fjord Horse Association) decided in 1982 that stallions of any age with any other white markings than a small white star cannot be accepted for breeding.

The Fjord horse breed standard recognises five colours. 90% of all Fjord horses are \\"brown dun\\" (the colour called \\"bay dun\\" in other breeds). The remaining 10% are either \\"red dun\\", \\"grey\\" (less often \\"grey dun\\", the colour known as grulla in other breeds), or two colours reflecting the influence of the cream gene: \\"white dun\\" (or \\"uls dun\\") and \\"yellow dun\\". The breed registries for Fjord horses encourage preservation of all colours. The dun colour variations can be subtle and hard to distinguish unless horses of different shades are standing side by side. The colour terms are also non- standard when compared to English terminology more commonly used to describe horse coat colours in other breeds. This difference appears to be based in part from being derived from Norwegian language terms, which were set in 1922, and their English translations, which were made official in 1980. While these terms were set before equine coat colour genetics were fully understood, the variations do match up to modern genetic studies as variations of dun colour with the addition of other genetic factors. *Brown dun (brunblakk) is the most common color. The body colour is a pale yellow-brown, and can vary from cream to almost a light chestnut. The primitive markings, as well as the midtstol and halefj√¶r, are black or dark brown. The remainder of the mane and tail is usually cream or white, though may be a darker on darker individuals. The colour is genetically bay diluted by the dun factor, called \\"dun\\", \\"bay dun\\" or \\"zebra dun\\" in other breeds. Red dun, showing lighter tail and body colour *The red dun (r√∏dblakk) has a pale golden body colour. Midtstol, halefj√¶r and primitive markings are red or red-brownish, always darker than the colour of the body, but never black. The rest of the mane and tail is usually cream, though on some individuals the entire mane and tail may be white. Like red duns in other breeds, this shade is produced by the dun factor diluting a genetic chestnut base colour. A\\"grey\\" or gr√•, a form of dun called \\"grullo\\" in other breeds. *The \\"grey\\" (gr√•) has a grey body; the shade can vary from light silver to dark slate grey. The midtstol, halefj√¶r and primitive markings are dark grey or black. The remainder of the mane, tail and forelock are a lighter grey than the body colour, and can be very pale. Though the term used in the breed standard for this colour is \\"grey\\", it is actually a form of dun and not a true genetic grey. The term \\"grey\\" and even \\"grey dun\\" are misnomers, as the Fjord horse gene pool does not carry the greying gene. The term used for this colour in other breeds and by geneticists is grullo, or blue dun. Like grullos in other breeds, the \\"grey\\" body colour is produced by the dun factor diluting a genetic black base colour. The term \\"grey dun\\" or \\"gr√•blakk\\" is sometimes used to describe this colour, but among Fjord horse owners, that terminology is considered incorrect even if more consistent. Had English-speaking Fjord horse breeders used the same naming conventions as for their breed's other shades, the colour could genetically be called a \\"black dun,\\" but this did not happen. *The white dun or uls dun (ulsblakk) has a cream body colour. The midtstol, halefj√¶r and primitive markings are black or off-black. The rest of the mane and tail are lighter than the body colour. The colouration is genetically a bay-based dun further diluted by a single allele of the cream gene, what is sometimes called a \\"buckskin dun\\" in other settings. *The yellow dun (gulblakk) is the rarest colour of Fjord horses. It is a red dun with an additional dilution factor that makes the body a light cream colour. This also due to the cream gene. The forelock, mane and tail can be completely white, and the primitive markings can be indistinct. Kvit, \\"white\\" Along with the recognised five shades of dun, two cream dilution alleles (CCr) on any other colour results in a horse with a light cream coat colour and blue eyes. This colour is called \\"kvit\\" (\\"white\\") in Norwegian, and is known as cremello, perlino or smoky cream in other breeds. A dun with double cream dilution will have faint or indistinguishable primitive markings.Norwegian Fjord horse at horse-genetics.com, accessed 4 December 2009] In the Fjord horse, Kvit was traditionally considered undesirable, and thus is a very rare colour in the breed due to intentional selection against it. Nonetheless, it is a normal colour within the gene pool, as the nature of cream genetics statistically will result in the occasional kvit horse any time two horses that both carry a single copy of the cream dilution are mated, such as an ulsblakk and/or a gulblakk. History The Fjord horse is one of the world's oldest and purest breeds, believed to be related to the Przewalski, a primitive wild horse of Asia. Horses were known to exist in Norway at the end of the last ice age. It is believed that the ancestors of the modern Fjord horse migrated to Norway and were domesticated over 4,000 years ago. Archaeological excavations at Viking burial sites indicate that the Fjord horse type has been selectively bred for at least 2,000 years. The Fjord horse was used by the Vikings as a war mount. The Fjord horse and its ancestors have been used for hundreds of years as farm animals in western Norway. Even as late as World War II, they were useful for work in mountainous terrain. Its strength, durability, and thick coat fare well in the rough winters of Denmark. The Fjord horse also has a long recorded history of pure breeding without crossbreeding from other sources. The Fjord horse is featured as a charge on the coat of arms of the municipalities of Gloppen and Eid, both in Nordfjord. Uses Fjord horse team in harness The Fjord horse is strong enough for heavy work, such as plowing fields or pulling timber, yet light and agile enough to be a good riding and driving horse. They are also sure-footed in the mountains. Today, the Fjord horse is a favourite at Norwegian riding and therapeutic schools, as its generally mild temperament and small size make it suitable for children and disabled individuals. They are considered very good driving horses, and are commonly used in everything from competitions to tourist transport in Norway. They are also used as a sport horse, particularly in combined driving.

Initially a follower of his brother-in-law, the Salian emperor Henry IV, his election as German anti-king in 1077 marked the outbreak of the Great Saxon Revolt and the first phase of open conflict in the Investiture Controversy between Emperor and Papacy. After a series of armed conflicts, Rudolf succumbed to his injuries after his forces defeated Henry's in the Battle on the Elster. Life Rudolf was the son of the Swabian count (Graf) Kuno of Rheinfelden. He was first mentioned in a 1048 deed issued by the Salian emperor Henry III as a count in the Swabian Sisgau on the High Rhine (in present-day Northwestern Switzerland), an estate then held by the Prince- Bishopric of Basel.Bresslau and Kehr, Die Urkunden Heinrichs III, no. 219 (1 June 1048), p. 292 Rudolf's family had large possessions up to Sankt Blasien Abbey in the Black Forest and down to the Aargau beyond the border with the Kingdom of Burgundy. He probably was related to King Rudolph II of Burgundy (d. 937), the Dukes of Lorraine and the Ottonian dynasty. =Duke of Swabia= When Duke Otto III of Swabia died without male heirs in 1057, Empress Agnes, consort of late Henry III, appointed him Swabian duke and administrator of Burgundy.Black-Veldtrupp, Kaiserin Agnes, p. 109. Rivalling with the Z√§hringen count Berthold, Rudolf according to Frutolf of Michelsberg had taken advantage of the minority of Agnes' son Henry IV, elected King of the Romans, by kidnapping his sister Matilda of Swabia.Ekkehardi Uraugiensis chronica. In: Rudolf demanded, and received, Matilda's hand in marriage (1059).Schwennicke, Europ√§ische Stammtafeln, table 12. In 1061 Berthold received the Duchy of Carinthia instead. When Matilda died in 1060, Rudolf subsequently, in 1066, married Adelaide of Savoy (d. 1079), a daughter of Count Otto of Savoy and Adelaide of Susa.Schwennicke, Europ√§ische Stammtafeln, table 95A; . When Adelaide's sister Bertha of Savoy married Henry IV in 1066, Rudolf became brother-in-law to the king twice over. During Agnes' regency, the Princes of the Holy Roman Empire could further strengthen their position against the Imperial authority. In the 1062 Coup of Kaiserswerth, several princes led by Archbishop Anno II of Cologne even abducted the minor king to enforce the surrender of the Imperial Regalia. When Henry came of age in 1065, he continued the policies of his father against the reluctant Saxon nobility, sparking the Saxon Rebellion in 1073. While other princes like the Carinthian duke Berthold of Z√§hringen or Duke Welf of Bavaria distanced themselves, Rudolf supported Henry's campaigns in Thuringia, when he was a primary force in the 1075 Battle of Langensalza against the insurgents. However, after the joint victory, Rudolf became estranged to the king and rumours occurred that he was involved in adversarial conspiracies. Empress Agnes repeatedly had to arbitrate between the parties.Black-Veldtrupp, Kaiserin Agnes, p. 304. Finally when the Investiture Controversy broke out and King Henry was excommunicated by Pope Gregory VII in February 1076, Duke Rudolf met with Berthold, Welf and several other princes in Trebur in order to decide on a course of action and to arrange a new election. Henry, observing the proceedings from his camp in Oppenheim on the other side of the Rhine, had to face a massive loss of support among the German nobles and realized that he had to achieve the lifting of his ban. Pope Gregory agreed to meet with the princes at Augsburg in February 1077. =Anti-king= Already in January, Henry hastened to see the pope on his way to the Empire from Rome. Duke Rudolf attempted to have the Alpine passes closed, nevertheless the king through wintry weather made his Walk to Canossa, where Gregory, fearing an armed attack by Henry's forces, had found refuge with Matilda of Tuscany. By doing penance, Henry managed to achieve absolution, buying time at the price of his reputation and secular authority. The rebels continued with their plans. Rudolf was elected anti-king on 15 March 1077 at the Kaiserpfalz in Forchheim, where already Louis the Child and Conrad I of Germany had been crowned. The first anti-king in the history of the Empire, he promised to respect the investiture solely according to canon law, as well as the concept of the elective monarchy. Further claims raised by the princes were rejected as simony by the attendant papal legates. Rudolf was supported by the Archbishops of Mainz, Salzburg and Magdeburg as well as by the Dukes of Carinthia and Bavaria, the Saxon rebel Otto of Nordheim and possibly also by Duke Magnus of Saxony. He proceeded to Mainz, where on 25 May he was crowned by Archbishop Siegfried I, but soon after was forced to flee to Saxony, when the Mainz citizens revolted. This presented a problem, since the Saxon duchy was cut off from his Swabian homelands by the king's Salian territory. Moreover, the pope avoided taking sides and adopted a waiting attitude. Rudolf was accused of greed, treason and usurpation by Henry's liensmen, while his own support crumbled.Vita Heinrici IV. imperatoris, ch. 4, p. 17; Liber de unitate ecclesiae, I 13. =Later life= Royal seal of Rudolf, 1079 Rudolf gave Swabia to his son Berthold and attempted to rectify his situation by stalking Henry's forces near W√ºrzburg, but to little effect. Meanwhile, he was deprived of Swabia by the Hoftag diet at Ulm in May, and the king gave the duchy to Frederick of B√ºren, the first Hohenstaufen ruler. The next year Henry waged a successful campaign to Bavaria, while Pope Gregory rejected to excommunicate Rudolf. The Battle of Mellrichstadt on 7 August 1078 proved indecisive: though the opposition forces under Otto of Nordheim were victorious, the troops of Berthold and Welf were stuck in a peasants' revolt. Rudolf found it difficult to convince the Saxons to fight beyond their borders; they viewed him as a southerner and distrusted him. He was also frustrated by the apparent reluctance of the pope to recognize his cause. In order to gain and maintain supporters, he was forced to grant large parts of the crown lands, as well as those of the church, to his followers. Nevertheless, things seemed to be improving in 1080. The battle of Flarchheim (27 January 1080) went well in his favor. On 7 March, the pope excommunicated Henry again and recognized Rudolf as king. Emboldened, Rudolf's forces met Henry's at the White Elster river in the Battle of Elster. The battle, which took place on 14 October 1080, would have been a huge victory for the anti-royalists. However, Rudolf lost his right hand in the battle and was mortally wounded in the abdomen. He withdrew to nearby Merseburg, where he died the next day and was buried. The majority of the support for the rebellion against Henry IV soon evaporated, but the struggle continued on in effect into 1085, with a final flare up in 1088 under Rudolph's successor, the second anti-king, Herman of Luxembourg. Issue With his second wife, Adelaide, Rudolf had at least four (and perhaps five) children: * Agnes of Rheinfelden, married Berthold II of Z√§hringen * Adelaide of Rheinfelden, married King Ladislaus I of Hungary * Bertha of Rheinfelden, Countess of Kellm√ºnz, married Ulrich X, Count of Bregenz * Otto (died young) * Berthold of Rheinfelden (the identity of Berthold's mother is disputed) NotesReferences *M.

The hall is part of the campus of the University of York. The present building comprises a central nine-bay two-storey block with attics and two two-storey wings at each end. It is built of brick in English bond with sandstone ashlar dressings. History The original Manor house was constructed in 1568 for Sir Thomas Eynns, the Secretary and Keeper of the Seal to the Council of the North; and his wife Elizabeth. Eynns died in 1573 and the estate were sold in 1601 by his nephews to the Hesketh family. On the death of Thomas Hesketh in 1708, the Hall passed by marriage to the Yarburgh family, who lived in it for several generations. In 1719 Henrietta Yarburgh, 26, married playwright Sir John Vanbrugh at St. Lawrence Parish Church (then the parish church of half of Heslington, including the Hall). The tombs of several members of the Hesketh and Yarburgh families can be seen in the churchyard of St Lawrence. Major Nicholas Yarburgh, who lived at the hall from 1825 to 1852 and was High Sheriff of Yorkshire for 1836, won the St Leger Stakes in 1839 with his horse Charles the Twelfth - one of the local pubs was subsequently named after him.Major Yarburgh's brown colt, Charles XII, Winner of the 1839 St. Leger, with William Scott Up On the death of Nicholas in 1852, ownership passed to his nephew Yarburgh Greame of Sewerby Hall, Bridlington, who adopted the surname Yarburgh and commissioned architect Philip Charles Hardwick in 1854 to rebuild the hall in the Victorian style. Parts of the original manor house which were preserved include two staircase towers, the courtyard and the pendant stucco ceiling of the great hall. The house was inherited on his death in 1856 by his own nephew, George John Lloyd (who then added the name Yarburgh) and in 1875 by George's daughter, Mary Elizabeth Yarburgh. She had married George William Bateson in 1862 and he then assumed in 1876 the additional surname of de Yarburgh by Royal licence. He later became the 2nd Baron Deramore after the death of his brother in 1890. His two sons, Robert Wilfred de Yarburgh-Bateson (3rd Baron Deramore) (1865‚Äì1936) and George Nicholas de Yarburgh-Bateson (4th Baron Deramore) (1870‚Äì1943), occupied after him.Archives hub According to Niklaus Pevsner's Yorkshire: York and the East Riding (page 463, 1995 edn), most of the interior of the Hall now visible is by York architect Brierley, of 1903. At the outbreak of the Second World War the house was vacated by the family who allowed it to be taken over by the Royal Air Force as the headquarters of No. 4 Group RAF, part of RAF Bomber Command. The hall was not re-occupied by the family after the war. In 1955 the hall was given Grade II* listed building status. When the University of York was founded (it opened to students in 1963) Sir Bernard Feilden supervised its conversion into the administrative headquarters of the University of York. The Hall and University were in that part of the East Riding of Yorkshire now part of the City of York.

He served as Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Defence and Minister for the Navy during his parliamentary career. Education and early career Killen was born in Dalby, Queensland and educated at Brisbane Grammar School and the University of Queensland, where he graduated in law. He enlisted for service in the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II; he was discharged in 1945 with the rank of flight sergeant. After the war he worked on the land before returning to Brisbane. In 1949 he joined the new Liberal Party of Australia and became the founding president of the Queensland Young Liberals. Political career Killen in 1968. In the 1955 election, Killen was elected to the House of Representatives for the Brisbane seat of Moreton, holding the seat until 1983. He quickly became known as a talented orator but his outspokenness and commitment to causes, which Menzies regarded as contrary to Liberal Party principles, limited his chances of promotion. His critics alleged he was associated with the extremist Australian League of Rights, whose director, Eric Dudley Butler, was a notorious anti-Semite, although Killen himself was never accused of anti-Semitism. He was an enthusiastic defender of Ian Smith's regime in Rhodesia. In the 1961 election, Killen narrowly retained his seat, and since Robert Menzies' Liberal government was re-elected with a majority of only two, and with Killen's seat the last to be declared, it was claimed by some that Killen had 'saved' Menzies and his government. Killen claimed that Menzies had phoned him, saying \\"Killen, you are magnificent!\\", and that story was widely repeated for many years, but he later confessed he had made it up for the Courier-Mail to overcome his disappointment at not, in fact, receiving such a call from Menzies.Gavin Souter, Acts of Parliament, p. 449 By the late 1960s Killen had somewhat moderated his views, and in the government of John Gorton he served as Minister for the Navy from 1969 to 1971. When William McMahon became Prime Minister, Killen was dropped from the Ministry. After the Liberals lost office to Labor under Gough Whitlam, he served in the Shadow Cabinet under Billy Snedden and Malcolm Fraser from 1972 to 1975, acting as the party spokesman on Education and later Defence. He served as Minister for Defence in the Fraser Government from 1975 to 1982. During this time he oversaw a major review of the Australian Defence Force and also the military build-up which followed the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. He oversaw the largest single piece of Defence expenditure in Australian history, the purchase of 75 F/A-18 Hornets. Killen was moved out of Defence in a 1982 reshuffle. He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George,London Gazette: (Supplement) no. 49009, page 33, 11 June 1982 becoming \\"Sir James Killen KCMG\\", and appointed Vice-President of the Executive Council, a position he held until the defeat of the Fraser government in 1983 election by Labor under Bob Hawke. He became Father of the House of Representatives in April 1983, and resigned his seat of Moreton in August 1983 (the first Queensland Member of the House of Representatives to resign), and returned to his legal practice. He was a prominent figure at the Brisbane bar through the 1980s and 1990s. Killen was a prominent monarchist and was elected to the Constitutional Convention in 1998 as an opponent of an Australian republic.Vizard, Steve, Two Weeks in Lilliput: Bear Baiting and Backbiting At the Constitutional Convention (Penguin, 1998, ) In 2004, he was made a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC). Killen had a reputation as a great parliamentary wit who developed close friendships with many people on both sides of politics, among them Gough Whitlam, Fred Daly and Barry Cohen. He wrote the preface to Daly's collection of political anecdotes, The Politician Who Laughed (1982). Private life Killen was married twice; first, in 1949, to Joy (n√©e Buley) with whom he had three daughters (one of whom predeceased him); Joy Killen died in 2000. He died in Brisbane in 2007; Gough Whitlam delivered the eulogy at his funeral in the city's Anglican cathedral and was survived by his second wife, Benise; two daughters; and two granddaughters.
