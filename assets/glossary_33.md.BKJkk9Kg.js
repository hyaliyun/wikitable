Summary In 1981, in recognition of the safety issues raised by the recreational operation of RC model aircraft, the FAA published this brief AC for the purpose of providing guidance to persons interested in flying model aircraft as a hobby or for recreational use. This guidance encourages good judgment on the part of model aircraft operators so that persons on the ground or other aircraft in flight will not be endangered. The AC contains among other things, guidance for site selection. Users are advised to avoid noise sensitive areas such as parks, schools, hospitals, and churches. Hobbyists are advised not to fly in the vicinity of spectators until they are confident that the model aircraft has been flight tested and proven airworthy. Model aircraft should be flown below 400 feet above the surface to avoid other aircraft in flight. The FAA expects that hobbyists will operate these recreational model aircraft within visual line-of-sight. Non-applicability to commercial operations Some commercial operators of unmanned aircraft systems have mistakenly used this AC as a basis for commercial flight operations. However, under FAA policy, AC 91-57 only applies to modelers, and thus specifically excludes its use by persons or companies for business purposes.

Its namesake and patron is St. Adalbert of Prague (c. 956 ‚Äì 23 April 997), bishop and martyr, and a Patron of Poland, the nation from which the Basilica's original parishioners emigrated. History The Basilica of St. Adalbert traces its beginning to the founding of the Saint Adalbert Aid Society in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1872. The purpose of the Society was to assist new Polish immigrants to Grand Rapids in finding housing and employment. It purchased two lots at the corner of Fourth Street and Davis Avenue, NW in 1880, and in June 1881 began construction of a small wooden church. Ten years later the frame structure was enlarged. In 1892 the Society built a large meeting hall for itself, which is still in use. Work began on the present church in July 1907. The cornerstone was laid on 18 August 1907, and construction continued late into the spring of 1913. It was built by the Andrews Brothers Company of Cleveland, Ohio. The cost for the building and its furnishings was approximately $150,000. The original wooden church was moved to Belmont, Michigan where it became Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church. This church continued to use the frame building until the late 1980s when it erected a new church. Pope John Paul II elevated St. Adalbert Church to the status of a minor basilica on 22 August 1979. The dedication liturgy was celebrated in conjunction with the centennial of the parish on 16 February 1980. The parish has subsequently been merged with St. James Parish, also in Grand Rapids. Architecture The Romanesque Revival edifice was designed by architect Henry J. Harks of Cleveland, Ohio. Architect Chris Vierheilig of Grand Rapids supervised its construction. The exterior walls of the Basilica are covered in limestone from Sandusky, Ohio and it is trimmed in Bedford limestone. The two towers that flank the fa√ßade are high and the large central dome rises to above the ground. The dome reflects Byzantine influence while the facade's large rose window reveals Gothic influence. The Basilica's stained glass windows were designed by A. Artmaier and created by craftsmen from Munich, Germany. Edmund Verlinden designed the altars, pulpit, baptismal font, and confessionals. The original communion rail was topped with Georgia marble. The pews were crafted by the American Seating Company of Grand Rapids, a nod to the City's large furniture industry.

Through the process of signal transduction, DORN1 couples extracellular ATP binding (which occurs during cellular stress) to downstream signalling and ultimately gene expression, which is thought to aid in plant survival.  Molecular properties  In contrast to animal purinergic receptors (which are G protein-coupled receptors), DORN1 is a lectin receptor kinase (LecRK), and is part of the L type lectin receptor kinases, due to its legume-like extracellular domain. In green plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana, several mutants lacking the DORN1 receptors are unable to phosphorylate mitogen-activated protein kinases after ATP stimulation.  Function  DORN1 receptors may play a role in mediating wound-induced inflammatory responses in green plants, with ATP acting as a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule. In response to cell lysis, ATP is discharged and binds onto the extracellular lectin domain of the DORN1 receptor. The intracellular DORN1 kinase domain is subsequently activated, resulting in several cellular responses such as mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, increased cytosolic calcium concentration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, ultimately leading to the induction of defence gene expression.

BIBFRAME was designed to replace the MARC standards, and to use linked data principles to make bibliographic data more useful both within and outside the library community. History The MARC Standards, which BIBFRAME seeks to replace, were developed by Henriette Avram at the US Library of Congress during the 1960s. By 1971, MARC formats had become the national standard for dissemination of bibliographic data in the United States, and the international standard by 1973. In a provocatively titled 2002 article, library technologist Roy Tennant argued that \\"MARC Must Die\\", noting that the standard was old; used only within the library community; and designed to be a display, rather than a storage or retrieval format. A 2008 report from the Library of Congress wrote that MARC is \\"based on forty-year old techniques for data management and is out of step with programming styles of today.\\" In 2012, the Library of Congress announced that it had contracted with Zepheira, a data management company, to develop a linked data alternative to MARC. Later that year, the library announced a new model called MARC Resources (MARCR). That November, the library released a more complete draft of the model, renamed BIBFRAME. The Library of Congress released version 2.0 of BIBFRAME in 2016. Design Illustration of BIBFRAME 2.0 model, with three core levels of abstraction (in blue)‚ÄîWork, Instance, Item‚Äîand three related classes (in orange)‚ÄîAgent, Subject, Event. BIBFRAME is expressed in RDF and based on three categories of abstraction (work, instance, item), with three additional classes (agent, subject, event) that relate to the core categories. While the work entity in BIBFRAME may be \\"considered as the union of the disjoint work and expression entities\\" in IFLA's Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) entity relationship model, BIBFRAME's instance entity is analogous to the FRBR manifestation entity. This represents an apparent break with FRBR and the FRBR-based Resource Description and Access (RDA) cataloging code. However, the original BIBFRAME model argues that the new model \\"can reflect the FRBR relationships in terms of a graph rather than as hierarchical relationships, after applying a reductionist technique.\\" Since both FRBR and BIBFRAME have been expressed in RDF, interoperability between the two models is technically possible. =Specific formats= The BIBFRAME model includes a serial entity for journals, magazines, and other periodicals. Several issues have prevented the model from being used for serials cataloging. BIBFRAME lacks several serials-related data fields available in MARC. A 2014 report was optimistic about BIBFRAME's suitability for describing audio and video resources, but also expressed concern about the high-level Work entity, which is unsuitable for modeling certain audio resources. Implementations * Colorado College's Tutt Library has created several experimental apps using BIBFRAME. * 14 other research libraries are testing the model. * Ex Libris published a roadmap to implement BIBFRAME in its library systems, which includes a MARC-to-BIBFRAME transformation. Related initiatives and standards * RDA, FRBR, FRBRoo, FRAD, and FRSAD are available in RDF in the Open Metadata Registry, a metadata registry. * Schema Bib Extend project, a W3C-sponsored community group has worked to extend Schema.org to make it suitable for bibliographic description.

Resellers present customers with a rebranded interface for deploying virtual machine instances, which are only billed for what their customers use. Cloud Harmony benchmarked the OrionVM Cloud Platform's InfiniBand-backed network storage as the world's fastest in 2011. The company was founded and is headquartered in Sydney, Australia, with offices in San Francisco, California.  History  OrionVM was founded in a dorm by Sheng Yeo, Alex Sharp and Joseph Glanville in 2010. The company's cloud platform was developed while the founders were still students at the University of Technology, Sydney and University of Sydney. After fifteen months of development, their cloud platform entered a Public Beta programme, with a full launch on 1 April 2011. In 2011, the company received angel investments from Australian entrepreneur and PIPE Networks co- founder Stephen Baxter and American Gordon Bell of DEC and Microsoft Research. For his work at OrionVM, CEO Sheng Yeo was nominated for the 2012 Australian Entrepreneur of the Year and the 2013 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year. In 2014, OrionVM received a State Merit award and a National Finalist nomination in the 2014 iAwards, with CTO Alex Sharp winning the Hills YIA Cloud award. The company was nominated for a Stevie Award for New Product or Service of the Year in Cloud Infrastructure Software, and an Australian Startup Awards nomination. In 2016, Yeo and Sharp were named in the Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list.  Products  OrionVM sells a wholesale cloud infrastructure platform for public, private and hybrid cloud deployments. Vendors can white-label the platform for resale, or for internal use. Prominent resellers include: * Australian telephone company AAPT * BizCloud * IT broker StrataCore.  Technology  OrionVM uses the Xen hypervisor to virtualise multiple machines (referred to as \\"instances\\") on the same hardware. Linux instances use paravirtualisation for reduced overhead by default, with Windows Server being deployed using hardware-assisted virtualisation (HVM). Traditional virtual private server and infrastructure as a service providers consolidate storage into a storage area network, which is limited by Ethernet network speeds and best-effort reliability. OrionVM's platform took design cues from supercomputers by placing hypervisor storage and compute on the same physical servers. These are backed by a decentralised InfiniBand fabric. This improves network reliability and performance, and allows for rapid rollover between physical hosts for high availability.  Features  = Rebranded panel = To end users, the base of the platform consists of a web panel, where customers are able to deploy virtual machines. For resellers, the logos and theme can be modified to suit their own branding. = Instances = From the panel, users can deploy preconfigured instances with their chosen operating system and required memory. Additional storage disks and IP addresses can be created separately, then assigned to new or existing instances. After shutting down, further resources can be allocated or scaled down. = Access = Instances can be accessed out-of-band via a web- based serial console or VNC session. Access is also available via ovm_ctl, an open source command line interface available from GitHub and the pip package manager. Linux machines come preconfigured with SSH, and Windows with RDP for remote access. = Templates = Instances can be provisioned from a series of predefined templates, which can be customised if required. They include: * CentOS * Debian Linux * FreeBSD * Slackware Linux * Ubuntu Server (long-term support releases) * Microsoft Windows Server Vyatta templates are officially supported for software-defined logical networking between instances. = API = A public API exists for controlling instances.

From 1878 to 1879, he attended the Master Class of Reinhold Begas on a state scholarship. Later that year he married, obtained a position in the studios of Otto Lessing and remained there for ten years, exhibiting regularly at the Academy. In 1889, he opened his own studio and soon attracted many large commissions.Thieme-Becker, Allgemeines Lexikon der Bildenden K√ºnstler von der Antike bis zur Gegenwart. =Siegesallee= In 1896, he was awarded a contract for the monumental Siegesallee (Victory Avenue) project being organized by Kaiser Wilhelm II. This honor was not achieved easily, however, as slanderous letters were directed against him, hateful anti-semitic comments were made about his wife, and a scandal soon developed. The Kaiser directed Reinhold Begas (who was overseeing the selection process) to make sure the proceedings were kept secret. Sigismund, from the Siegesallee Eventually, Boermel won approval upon the recommendation of , the Minister of the Royal Houses.Uta Lehnert: Der Kaiser und die Siegesallee. R√©clame Royale. Dietrich Reimer Verlag, Berlin 1998, . He produced Group 14, consisting of Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg as the center statue, flanked by Lippold von Bredow, the Landeshauptmann of Mittelmark, and Bernd Ryke, who served several terms as Mayor of Berlin in the late Fourteenth and early Fifteenth Centuries. The figures were dedicated on 6 May 1900. Critical reception was devastating, with one commentator labelling them some of the worst on the entire avenue. More thoughtful voices pinpointed the problem as a misguided effort to render smaller designs (typical of his previous work) on a grandiose scale. In October 1899, several of the early busts were vandalized by critics who derisively referred to the Siegesallee as the \\"Puppenallee\\" (Dolls Avenue), an event later referred to as the \\"Marmorattentat\\" (Marble Assassination). In response, Boermel designed a device composed of collapsible iron bars with steel tips to protect the statues, but the Kaiser chose to go with heavy iron chains instead. All the figures on the Siegesallee were damaged during World War II and are now on display at the Spandau Citadel. = Final years and other activities = He was an occasional writer, producing some dramatic works (apparently never published) and essays on subjects such as \\"The Artist and Public Corporations\\" and \\"How is the Further Development of Monumental Statuary Possible?\\". Technology also attracted his interest and he held several patents related to seismic engineering.Official Gazette of the United States Patent Office, Vol. 135.

Boundary Changes There were boundary changes in the Aberaeron area, arising from the formation of the Aberaeron Urban District Council in 1894. Unopposed Returns There were a number of unopposed returns. The Conservatives held seats they won in 1895 including Borth and Cardigan South while Independent Conservative Henry Bonsall was returned unopposed for Bow Street. Contested Elections The Liberals won Aberystwyth No.1, lost in 1895, after the Unionists failed to field a candidate. Retiring Aldermen Eight aldermen retired. Of these only Peter Jones (Trefeurig) and Jenkin Jenkins (Felinfach) sought re-election, although two others (John Powell and Evan Richards) would be re-elected without facing the electorate. Jenkins was defeated at Felinfach by Walter T. Davies. Davies, however was among those who were chosen as new aldermen enabling Jenkins to contest the by-election (see below).

Neither the Cambrian News or the Aberystwyth Observer indicated party affiliation although the Brython Cymreig did so in relation to the contested elections only. The Welsh Gazette commented that while the contests at Aberystwyth were on political lines, many of those in the rural areas were between candidates whose political views were often indistinguishable. In many ways this reflected the changes in the politics of the county, now represented at Westminster by the former Conservative, Matthew Vaughan Davies. Contested Elections The vast majority of councillors were elected unopposed. Only ten of the 48 wards were contested at the election. Retiring Aldermen Eight aldermen retired, all of whom were Liberals. Of these only Morgan Evans in Llanarth and James Stephens in Cardigan South sought election. Neither was re- elected an alderman.

History  The Devon Bat Group was formed in the English county of Devon in 1984 by people concerned about the decline of British bats. Devon, in the South West of England, is of special importance as it supports most of the British bat species and DBG members work to maintain this diversity and increase our knowledge about bats. It is one of a network of bat groups in the UK which are members of The Bat Conservation Trust. The Bat Conservation Trust was formed in 1991 as an umbrella organisation for the network of bat groups in the UK.  Group members and activities  The Group members range from people who are interested in learning more about bats and those wanting to join in group activities to professional ecologists. Activities include roost visits, organising bat box schemes, with regular box checks, and bat surveys. Educational talks, arranging bat walks and caring for sick and injured bats are also organised by DBG members. Members with bat licences carry out Bat Roost Visitor work for Natural England. General Group meetings are held every three months and the DBG also has local sections in Exeter, Plymouth and North Devon to organise more local activities. The group works in partnership with many other organisations across Devon. At several reservoirs across Devon, they have worked with the South West Lakes Trust to monitor bat populations at Roadford Lake and other reservoirs. They participate in the Devon Greater Horseshoe Bat Project alongside Devon Wildlife Trust, Clinton Devon Estates, Devon County Council and others. In 2014 and 2015 they helped to run a citizen science project called The Big Exeter Bat Survey to find out about where (and which) bats live in Exeter. As part of the work to re-open Hemerdon Mine, survey data from the group were used as evidence to draw up a plan to mitigate the impact of mining on the bats. Bat Species Found in Devon 16 out of 18 UK resident species of bat have been found in Devon.

It is located next to the Los Barrios Power Plant, which is a coal fueled power station. It is the largest refinery in the Iberian Peninsula, with a crude oil daily processing capacity of 240,000 barrels per day. The refinery occupies 150 acres and has a refining capacity of 12 million tons per year, making it the largest Spanish refinery. The Spanish Government has been accused of having built the refinery deliberately in an effort to negatively affect the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar, although pollution is indiscriminate and it also affects a large Spanish population in southern Spain. The results of local air samples by both the Gibraltar and Spanish NGOs and environmental groups are regularly reported to the relevant European Union institutions. Apart from imposing fines on the wealthy CEPSA conglomerate, no other real action is taken. As of 2018 work began on using Detal technology which will produce linear alkylbenzene, work will take around two years to complete. Products produced The refinery currently produces propane, butane, gasoline, aviation fuel, diesel oil and fuel oil. Safety record On May 27, 1985, a Japanese ship called Petragen One docked in the refinery and was unloading 20,000 tons of naphtha, which exploded and also caused the Spanish tanker Camponavia to catch fire. 33 people died and 36 were injured. The fire started explosions in the Camponavia, which broke in two and sank in a slick of burning oil. The Japanese ship also snapped in two, leaving only the burning bow and stern visible above the waterline. On January 21, 2003, the barge of CEPSA Spabunker IV, used to supply fuel to ships crossing the Strait of Gibraltar, sank during a storm on the way from the dock to seek refuge in the port of Algeciras, just a few miles away. The captain died. In 2007 a particularly serious sulphur incident happened as well as intermittent flaring episodes. The impacts of such upsets on surrounding neighbourhoods had provoked outrage and public protest which led to the Consejer√≠a de Medio Ambiente of the Junta de Andaluc√≠a to order an independent audit aimed at investigating such incidents. In September 2011 a large fire could be seen for miles around, with black smoke coming from the refinery. In May 2014 a report by the World Health Organization showed that the nearby town of La L√≠nea de la Concepci√≥n had the worst air quality in Spain. The report concentrated on PM10 and PM2.5 Pollutants in the air, which could only have come from the refinery. In May 2016 the report by the World Health Organization had placed La L√≠nea as the third worst place in Spain in terms of air quality.

It was built in 1949‚Äì50 to a design by Anthony Lloyd, and demolished in 2009. Site The building was located on the eastern side of Savile Row, to the north of New Burlington Street and south of New Burlington Place. Until the 1930s, Saville Row ended at its junction with Boyle Street, just north of New Burlington Street. The route north continued through a narrow passageway, Savile Place, between No 22 and No 23 Savile Row, and then became Mill Street, which crossed Conduit Street on a slightly different alignment. No 22 was demolished around 1937 to allow Savile Row to continue to the north without interruption, to improve access to a new police station across the road at no 27, on the corner of Savile Row and Boyle Street. As a result of the slight misalignment of the road, the site where Fortress House was built occupied a prominent site where the road veered, clearly visible from both directions. Design The main designer was Anthony Lloyd,\\"The architects were W. Curtis Green R.A., Son and Lloyd. This practice comprised William Curtis Green, his son Christopher Green, and his son-in-law Anthony Lloyd. At the time of this commission W. Curtis Green, although 75 years of age, was still the firm‚Äôs active senior partner. (He did not finally retire from practice until 1958.) The main designer of Fortress House was Anthony Lloyd, with William Curtis Green RA also involved throughout the project. Collaboration between W. Curtis Green and Anthony Lloyd in designing buildings extended back to 1927.\\", Fortress House Threatened, 20th Century Society, May 2006 although his partner, who was his father-in-law William Curtis Green RA (1875‚Äì1960), may also have been involved in the design. Lloyd adopted an austere style, with some classical motifs. The building was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as \\"large and monumental and self-consciously Lutyens, though with occasional rococo bits\\". Lloyd adopted a symmetrical \\"H\\" plan, with the main rectangular block of eight stories set back from the street with courtyard in front, and wings of seven stories to either side. The design maximised light and air, but broke the building line along Savile Row. It was constructed using a reinforced concrete frame with reinforced concrete floors and a flat roof. The fa√ßades on Savile Row and New Burlington Street were faced with Portland stone; other sides, including New Burlington Place, and internal courtyards were faced in brown Uxbridge flint bricks. The building had little ornamentation: rustication on the ground floor disguised a change in levels along Savile Row, and a dental cornice at the top of the central block. A large entrance porch to central block, with pilasters surmounted by a recessed semi-circular headed niche within an open triangular pediment. Decorative sculptural motifs were carved by Laurence Turner. History The building was constructed by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons in 1949‚Äì50 and became the headquarters of the Central Electricity Board. It was later occupied by the Ministry of Town and Country Planning. Next it became the headquarters of the Ministry of Health in 1951, and later the headquarters of the Civil Service Commission. Finally, in 1971 it became the headquarters of the government office that became English Heritage in 1983 (the present day Historic England agency and English Heritage Trust charity). English Heritage was paid ¬£3m to leave in 2006, ten years before the end of its lease, and moved to the old Prudential building at Holborn Bars. In 2006, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport issued a certificate of exemption from listing effective until December 2010. Westminster City Council granted Conservation Area consent authorising demolition. SAVE Britain's Heritage and the 20th Century Society campaigned for it to be saved, but the building and consent for its site's redevelopment, was sold by Legal & General in 2006 for around ¬£110m. It was demolished in 2009 and replaced by a mixed-use development, designed by Eric Parry Architects. A public art sculpture by Joel Shapiro is located above the Savile Row entrance. The new building was sold in 2012 for around ¬£220m.

Known as the \\"Standard Beauty\\", she was active in the film industry for only three years, and quit acting after the suicide of the great star Ruan Lingyu in 1935. Her first husband was Li Jinhui, the \\"Father of Chinese pop music\\". During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Xu and her second husband, Lieutenant General Tang Shengming, ostensibly served under the Japanese-controlled Nanking puppet regime, but secretly worked as agents for the Republic of China resistance based in Chungking. With the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, Xu and Tang defected to the People's Republic of China, but were severely persecuted during the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì76). Xu Lai died in prison in 1973; her husband survived and lived until 1987. Early life Xu Lai's autographed photo for Zhou Xuan, a younger star of the Bright Moon Troupe Xu Lai was born 1909 to a poor family in Shanghai. Her original name was Xu Xiaomei () and she was also called Xu Jiefeng (). Due to poverty, she began working at a British-owned egg factory in Zhabei at the age of 13, but was later able to attend school after her family fortunes improved. In 1927, Xu attended the China Song and Dance School run by Li Jinhui, who is now considered the \\"Father of Chinese pop music\\". She also joined Li's Bright Moon Song and Dance Troupe and toured many cities in China and Southeast Asia. She married Li, who was 18 years her senior, in 1930, and gave birth to a daughter named Xiaofeng. Film career and other activities Xu Lai in Remnants of Spring (1933), probably the earliest female bath scene in the history of Chinese cinema In 1932, Xu Lai was recruited by Zhou Jianyun, a cofounder of the Mingxing Film Company, to join the studio. She became famous after starring in the 1933 silent film Remnants of Spring (), in which she appeared in probably the earliest female bath scene in the history of Chinese cinema. Later that year she starred in A Feather on Mount Tai (). In 1934, she starred in Cheng Bugao's popular patriotic films Romance of Mount Hua () and Go Northwest (). Xu Lai, together with Wang Renmei and Li Lili, her former colleagues at the Bright Moon Troupe, were the earliest stars to portray the vibrant, wholesome, and sexy \\"country girl\\" prototype, which became one of the most popular figures in Chinese cinema, and later inherited by the cinema of Hong Kong. Xu Lai Xu became widely known as the \\"Standard Beauty\\", and a ceremony was held to crown her the \\"Beauty Queen of the Far East\\". The Shanghai Chinese Women's Association strongly disapproved of her \\"coronation\\". Among the objections raised was that she \\"shocked the public by exhibiting herself in the nude\\", referring to her bath scene. The suicide of actress Ruan Lingyu in 1935, which caused three other women to commit suicide during her long funeral procession, had a major impact on Xu Lai. She quit acting after finishing her last film, The Boatman's Daughter (), directed by Shen Xiling. It was critically acclaimed and considered her best film. The sudden death of her daughter Xiaofeng, also in 1935, caused a breakdown of her marriage with Li Jinhui and the couple divorced in November of that year. It was an acrimonious divorce and Li requested compensation for the investment he had made in training her. Secret agent In 1936, Xu Lai married Tang Shengming (), a Kuomintang Lieutenant General from a prominent Hunanese family. Tang was a notorious playboy and a close friend of Dai Li, chief of the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (Juntong), the secret service of the Republic of China. Xu's assistant Zhang Suzhen (), a Juntong secret agent, became Tang's concubine, and Shanghai tabloids often reported salacious stories of the three sharing the same bed. Tang made sure that Xu Lai introduced Dai Li to the \\"movie queen\\" Hu Die, who later became the spy chief's mistress. A year after her wedding, the Second Sino-Japanese War erupted. The Imperial Japanese Army attacked Shanghai in August 1937, and the national capital Nanking in December. Tang's older brother, General Tang Shengzhi, was the chief commander of the doomed defense of Nanking, which resulted in the Nanking Massacre. Tang Shengming, meanwhile, was the deputy commander of Changsha and chief commander of Changde, both in Hunan province. Xu Lai In 1940, Tang Shengming surrendered to the Japanese and was recruited to serve in the Reorganized National Government of China (the Wang Jingwei regime), a puppet government established by Japan in occupied Nanking. Tang was appointed the commander of public security of Jiangsu province, while Xu was his socialite wife who became a close friend with the wives of Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo, and Zhou Fohai, the top leaders of the puppet regime. They were widely condemned by the Chinese public as traitors, and Tang Shengzhi publicly renounced all relationship with his brother and sister-in- law. After the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II, the Kuomintang government revealed that Tang Shengming and Xu Lai had been sent by Dai Li to serve as secret agents in the Wang Jingwei regime. The couple took great personal risks to obtain intelligence about Japanese spies and troop movements and pass it to the resistance. Xu Lai reportedly discovered the identity of a Japanese spy while playing mahjong with Zhou Fohai's wife, and personally delivered messages to Chinese agents in Shanghai in urgent situations. After 1949 and death Xu Lai on the cover of The Young Companion, a Shanghai pictorial. In 1949, as it was becoming clear that Mao Zedong's Communists were winning the Chinese Civil War, Xu Lai moved her family from Shanghai to British Hong Kong, while Tang Shengming went to Changsha to join the surrender of Hunan Governor Cheng Qian to the Communists. His brother Tang Shengzhi also surrendered. In 1950, Tang Shengming was appointed deputy commander of 21st Group Army of the People's Liberation Army and fought battles against the Kuomintang troops in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. In 1956, Tang was appointed a counsellor of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and Xu Lai moved with her husband to Beijing. When the Cultural Revolution started in 1966, Mao's wife Jiang Qing, who had been a minor actress in Shanghai during the 1930s, began persecuting many of her former colleagues who were familiar with her \\"bourgeois\\" past. Xu Lai and her husband were both imprisoned for unfounded criminal charges. On 4 April 1973, Xu died in prison after years of torture and maltreatment, at the age of 64. Tang survived the tumultuous period, and lived until 1987.

There is currently no de facto standard for IPS, however magnetic positioning appears to be the most complete and cost effective. It offers accuracy without any hardware requirements and a relatively low total cost of ownership. According to Opus Research magnetic positioning will emerge as a ‚Äúfoundational‚Äù indoor location technology. Magnetic positioning was invented by Professor Janne Haverinen and Anssi Kemppainen. Noticing that buildings' magnetic distortions were leading machines astray, they eventually turned the problem around and focused attention on the magnetic interferences caused by steel structures. What they found was that the disturbances inside them were consistent, creating a magnetic fingerprint unique to a building. Professor Janne Haverinen founded the company IndoorAtlas in 2012 to commercialize the magnetic positioning solution with dual headquarters in Mountain View, CA and Oulu, Finland.

House from Hell originated as a radio competition, which was part of the Triple M breakfast show hosted by Andrew Denton and Amanda Keller. It debuted on television on 8 October 1998. The contestants were placed in a house together for three months and involved in various stunts and ordeals. It was a precursor to Big Brother, and Denton has conceded in radio interviews that he regrets being involved in the program, due to the unacceptable level of human manipulation. The successful contestants were personally chosen by Denton from 1,000 applicants and lived in a four-bedroom house in Naremburn on Sydney's lower North Shore. Denton recalled, \\"Everyone I know has been through some share accommodation and knows how horrible it can be to be in some horrible place with people you don't like, and there's that great saying that hell is other people.\\" The six contestants were: 40-year- old, married father-of-three Colin Beggs, who described himself as a \\"yobbo\\", 26 year-old Kellie Henneberry who worked in advertising and sought to educate the public about her homosexuality, 31 year-old Sandra Emberton, who had had a career as an exotic dancer, Joselyn Barber, who at 21 was studying Arts at Sydney University, surfer Andrew Janiszewski, 22, and Lee Hunter, 28, who worked in painting and decorating. For the first two weeks, the contestants were confined to the house. Their challenges included wearing boxing gloves for a weekend, spending another two full days tied to each other, and having meals that consisted solely of baked beans, prunes and ice cream. One weekend all their household furniture was switched with child-sized replacements while they were made to wear sumo wrestler suits. The prize money was $5000.

Currently, Battle serves as the director of the Master of Social Work program and as a professor of social work at the University of Saint Joseph in West Hartford, Connecticut. Early life and education Battle is a native of Springfield, Massachusetts Battle holds four degrees. In 1973, he earned a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from Springfield College; a Master of Social Work from the University of Connecticut in 1975; and a Master of Public Health and Doctorate in social welfare policy from the University of Pittsburgh in 1979 and 1980 respectively. Battle later completed the Institute for Educational Management at Harvard University and the Millennium Leadership Institute of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. Career Battle's career in academics spans over 3 decades. Starting in 1980, he was an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota School of Social Work. From there, Battle would serve at public and private institutions, including Boston University, the University of Connecticut, Eastern Connecticut State University, and the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee, where he served as vice chancellor of student and multicultural affairs from 2000 to 2003. =Coppin State University= On March 3, 2003, Battle was appointed as the fourth president of Coppin State College in Baltimore, Maryland. The Battle administration focused on a three-point plan of academic excellence, facilities improvement and external relations to improve the college. Under Battle's leadership, the campus attained university status in 2004, and changed its name to Coppin State University. According to a university press release, state support increased by more than 50 percent in the 2005‚Äì2006 fiscal year during Battle's tenure. Coppin also became the first completely wireless campus in the University System of Maryland. Battle was also the creative force behind the establishment of the Urban Educational Corridor, a partnership with an elementary, middle and high schools. Under his tutelage, the university also managed the Coppin/Rosemont Initiative; the only higher education institution in Maryland to manage a public school that was failing and helped raise it to the ranks of the very best city schools. In 2005, he established The Coppin Academy, a 400-student on-campus high school partially funded by the Gates Foundation and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. In November 2006, the board of governors of the University of North Carolina, elected Battle as the newest chancellor of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro, North Carolina. =North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University= Battle would assume the role of chancellor of the University on July 1, 2007; and would be installed as the 11th in the school's history in April of the following year. Under Battle's leadership, the university focused on continuing to increase its national academic reputation while preparing globally competent students. During the fall of 2008, North Carolina A&T; had its College of engineering ranked among the top 25 in the nation; increased the pass rate in its School of Nursing from 66% to a 91%, resulting in full accreditation with no sanction; and also became the only Historically Black University to have a Wall Street trading room. The university also became the first Historically Black University to receive the prestigious Engineering Research Center (ERC) grant awarded by the National Science Foundation. The grant consists of an award of $18 million over 5 years with a 10-year life span. A&T; was also the only HBCU in the nation with a Wall Street trading room. Battle implemented the Dowdy Scholarship program. Named for the university's sixth president and first chancellor, Lewis C. Dowdy and his wife Elizabeth, the four-year scholarship is awarded to outstanding scholars with GPAs ranging from 3.2 to 4.0. Battle also developed and implemented The Cosby Kids initiative, a joint effort with Guilford Technical Community College, that tracked 4th, 6th, and 8th grade students through high school to prepare them to enroll in college by focusing on math, reading comprehension and science. He also signed a Memorandum of Agreement with Guilford Tech to assist students that, academically, were not fully prepared to enter North Carolina A&T.; In February 2009, Battle announced his resignation from North Carolina A&T;, effective June 30 of that year, citing personal and family reasons for his departure from the university. =Southern Connecticut State University= After being appointed on April 1, 2010, Battle assumed the position of interim president of Southern Connecticut State University effective in May 2010. As interim president, Battle was instrumental in the timely renovation and building of two major facilities projects on the New Haven campus. He also hired three new deans to strengthen the academic program in addition to raising $1.4 million for the campus. Battle also established the Southern Academy, an academic enhancement program for rising 4th graders in preparation for college. This initiative led to an appearance on the Today Show with Bill Cosby. In late 2011, it was announced that Battle withdrew his name from consideration for the position as president to pursue other opportunities. In April the following year, Battle joined the faculty of Central Connecticut State University as a professor of social work. =Present day= Battle served Central Connecticut State University as a member of the faculty from 2012 to 2013. In August 2013, it was announced that Battle would be appointed as professor of social work and the founding director of the master's degree in social work program at the University of Saint Joseph in West Hartford, Connecticut. Personal life Battle is married to his wife Judith Lynn Rozie-Battle, who holds a law degree from the University of Minnesota, a master's degree from the School of Social Work at the University of Connecticut, and a bachelor's degree from the University of New Haven.

He is mostly known for his work as a war artist during the 1940s.  Life and family  Goldhamer was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and came to Canada with his family the following year, first settling in Owen Sound, Ontario and later Toronto. Goldhamer produced art for Eaton's advertising pages and drew a regular cartoon for the Star Weekly. He continued his education at the Ontario College of Art, studying with Arthur Lismer. In 1926, he taught at the Ontario College of Art and from 1928 on at the Central Technical School, in time serving as the chairman of the art department, and retiring in 1969, after working there forty-two years. In 1948, he married the English-born performer Anna Russell; they divorced in 1954. He died in Toronto at the age of 81.  Artistic career  Goldhamer exhibited with the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts (1928‚Äì1939), the Ontario Society of Artists (1930‚Äì1939), the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour (1930‚Äì39) and the Canadian Society of Graphic Art (1928‚Äì1939) and was a member of the Society of Canadian Painter-Etchers & Engravers and The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto. He was president of the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour from 1941 to 1943. A number of his watercolours appeared in the show A Century of Canadian Art at the Tate in London in 1938. Goldhamer served overseas with the Royal Canadian Air Force as an official Canadian war artist from 1943 to 1946. He was appointed the supervisor of art programs for air force personnel, and in 1945, made charcoal drawings of surgery patients at the Queen Victoria Hospital (formerly the R.C.A.F. Plastic Surgery Hospital) at East Grinstead, Sussex, a hospital with among its services, the severely burned. While in the armed services, he wrote and illustrated a booklet titled Drawing for pleasure in a series called How-To-Get-Started. In 1954, Paul Duval selected his watercolour of Fishing Boats, Atlantic Coast, for his book, Canadian Water Colour Painting. Duval wrote of Goldhamer that his early work was of habitants and scenes along the Atlantic coast but more recently he had developed a fresh vein of landscape fantasy. In 1982, a retrospective of his work was held in Toronto at The Arts and Letters Club. In 1985, an exhibition of watercolors he had painted from 1935 to 1944, of the artisans in Baie- Saint-Paul, organized by The Robert McLaughlin Gallery, was shown in Baie- Saint-Paul. = Legacy = His works are held in the collections of the Canadian War Museum, The Robert McLaughlin Gallery, Oshawa, the National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario and Hart House at the University of Toronto.

It is the only member of Liropus known from the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Description Like all members of Caprellidae, Liropus minusculus have slender, translucent bodies that make them look like living skeletons. The coloration helps them camouflage in with their surroundings, resembling seaweed or other vegetation. They are very small, measuring only about in length, and smallest of the nine species of Liropus. Liropus minusculus is a predator that remains still, clinging to rocks or plants, until prey approaches. Males have claw-like gnathopods which are used during mating to grasp the female. Females have smaller gnathopods. L. minusculus is distinguishable from other members of Liropus primarily from the shape of its torso and abdominal limbs. In May 2014, the International Institute for Species Exploration listed L. minusculus as one of the \\"Top 10 News Species\\" named in 2013. Habitat Liropus minusculus is known from specimens collected from in a cave about below the surface of the ocean. The cave is located in Isthmus Reef, off the coast of Catalina Island, California. L. minusculus is the only known member of Liropus that lives in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Discovery and taxonomic history While visiting the Canadian Museum of Nature, University of Seville researcher Jos√© Manuel Guerra-Garc√≠a and colleague Ed Hendrycks (from CMN) recognized that two specimens ‚Äì one male and one female ‚Äì found in the museums collections were examples of a previously unknown species. They formally described the new species as Liropus minusculus in the October 8, 2013 issue of Zootaxa. The specific name is a reference to the species' tiny size.

The motivation for banking union was the fragility of numerous banks in the Eurozone, and the identification of vicious circle between credit conditions for these banks and the sovereign credit of their respective home countries (\\"bank-sovereign vicious circle\\"). In several countries, private debts arising from a property bubble were transferred to sovereign debt as a result of banking system bailouts and government responses to slowing economies post- bubble. Conversely, weakness in sovereign credit resulted in deterioration of the balance sheet position of the banking sector, not least because of high domestic sovereign exposures of the banks. As of mid-2020, the Banking Union mainly consists of two main initiatives, the Single Supervisory Mechanism and Single Resolution Mechanism, which are based upon the EU's \\"single rulebook\\" or common financial regulatory framework. The SSM took up its authority on 4 November 2014, and the SRM entered into full force on 1 January 2015. Most accounts of banking union view it as incomplete in the absence of a European deposit insurance. The European Commission made a legislative proposal for a European Deposit Insurance Scheme in November 2015, but it has not been adopted by the EU co-legislators. Until October 2020, the geographical scope of the Banking Union was identical to that of the euro area. Other non-euro member states of the EU may join the Banking Union under a procedure known as close cooperation. Bulgaria and Croatia initiated requests for close cooperation, respectively in July 2018 and May 2019. Following a formal approval of these requests in June 2020, the European Central Bank started supervising the larger Bulgarian and Croatian banks on October 1, 2020. Name The earliest recorded public use of the expression \\"banking union\\" in the Eurozone crisis context was in an article by scholar Nicolas V√©ron published near-simultaneously by Bruegel, the Peterson Institute for International Economics and VoxEU.org (a website of CEPR) in December 2011. It paralleled the earlier advocacy of fiscal union by various observers and policymakers in the same context, especially in Germany in the second half of 2011. According to V√©ron, the expression had been suggested to him by European Commission official Maarten Verwey. From April 2012, the expression was later popularised by the financial press, initially with reference to its use by Bruegel scholars. From June 2012 onward, it was increasingly used in the public policy debate, including by the European Commission. Background and formation The integration of bank regulation has long been sought by EU policymakers, as a complement to the internal market for capital and, from the 1990s on, of the single currency. However, powerful political obstacles including the willingness of member states to retain instruments of financial repression and economic nationalism led to the failure of prior attempts to create a European framework for banking supervision, including during the negotiation of the Maastricht Treaty in 1991 and of the Treaty of Nice in 2000. During the 2000s, the emergence of pan-European banking groups through cross-border mergers and acquisitions (such as the purchases of Abbey National by Santander Group, HypoVereinsbank by UniCredit and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro by BNP Paribas) led to renewed calls for banking policy integration, not least by the International Monetary Fund, but with limited policy action beyond the creation of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors in 2004. Deterioration of credit conditions during the Eurozone crisis, and specifically the contagion of financial instability to larger member states of the euro area from the middle of 2011, led to renewed thinking about the interdependence between banking policy, financial integration, and financial stability. On 17 April 2012, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde renewed the institution's earlier calls for banking policy integration by specifically referring to the need for the euro monetary union to be \\"...supported by stronger financial integration which our analysis suggests be in the form of unified supervision, a single bank resolution authority with a common backstop, and a single deposit insurance fund.\\" The following week on 25 April 2012, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi echoed this call by noting in a speech before the European Parliament that \\"Ensuring a well-functioning EMU implies strengthening banking supervision and resolution at European level\\". Suggestions for more integrated European banking supervision were further discussed during an informal European Council meeting on 23 May 2012, and appear to have been backed at the time by French President Fran√ßois Hollande, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, and European Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso. German Chancellor Angela Merkel signalled a degree of convergence on this agenda when declaring on 4 June 2012, that European leaders \\"will also talk about to what extent we have to put systemically (important) banks under a specific European oversight\\". Another milestone was the report delivered on 26 June 2012, by European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, which called for deeper integration in the Eurozone and proposed major changes in four areas. First, it called for a banking union encompassing direct recapitalisation of banks by the European Stability Mechanism, a common financial supervisor, a common bank resolution scheme and a deposit guarantee fund. Second, the proposals for a fiscal union included a strict supervision of eurozone countries' budgets, and calls for eurobonds in the medium term. Third, it called for more integration on economic policy, and fourth, for the strengthening of democratic legitimacy and accountability. The latter is generally envisioned as giving supervisory powers to the European Parliament in financial matters and in reinforcing the political union. A new treaty would be required to enact the proposed changes. The key moment of decision was a summit of euro area heads of state and government on 28‚Äì29 June 2012. The summit's brief statement, published early on 29 June, began with a declaration of intent, \\"We affirm that it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns,\\" which was later repeated in numerous successive communications of the European Council. It followed by announcing two major policy initiatives: first, the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism under the European Central Bank's authority, using Article 127(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union; and second, \\"when an effective single supervisory mechanism is established,\\" the possibility of direct bank recapitalisation by the European Stability Mechanism, possibly with retroactive effect in the case of Spain and Ireland. In the following weeks, the German government quickly backtracked on the commitment about direct bank recapitalisation by the ESM. In September 2012, it was joined on this stance by the governments of Finland and the Netherlands. Eventually, such conditions were put on the ESM direct recapitalisation instrument that, as of September 2014, it has never been activated. However, the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism proceeded apace. Furthermore, in December 2012 the European Council announced the creation of the Single Resolution Mechanism. Europe's banking union has been identified by many analysts and policymakers as a major structural policy initiative that has played a significant role in addressing the Eurozone crisis. Single Rulebook The single rulebook is a name for the EU laws that collectively govern the financial sector across the entire European Union. The provisions of the single rulebook are set out in three main legislative acts: *Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive (also known as CRD IV; Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of 26 June 2013; Directive 2013/36/EU of 26 June 2013), which implements the Basel III capital requirements for banks. *Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive (DGSD; Directive 2014/49/EU of 16 April 2014), which regulates deposit insurance in case of a bank's inability to pay its debts. *Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD; Directive 2014/59/EU of 15 May 2014), which establishes a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms in danger of failing. Single Supervisory Mechanism Eurotower, home of the European Central Bank supervisory staff The first pillar of the banking union is the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), which grants the European Central Bank (ECB) a leading supervisory role over banks in the euro area. Participation is automatic for all euro area member states, and optional for other EU member states through the process known as \\"close cooperation\\" established by the SSM Regulation of October 2013. While all banks in participating states will be under the supervision of the ECB, this is carried out in co-operation with national supervisors. The banking groups designated by the SSM as \\"significant institutions\\", including all those with assets greater than 30 billion euros or 20% of the GDP of the member state where they are based, are directly supervised by the ECB. Smaller banks, known in the banking union as \\"less significant institutions\\", remain directly monitored by the national supervisory authorities of the member state in which they are established, even though the ECB has indirect supervisory oversight and also the authority to take over direct supervision of any bank. The ECB's monitoring regime includes conducting stress tests on financial institutions. If problems are found, the ECB will have the ability to conduct early intervention in the bank to rectify the situation, such as by setting capital or risk limits or by requiring changes in management. The SSM was enacted through Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 of 15 October 2013 conferring specific tasks on the European Central Bank concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions, known as the SSM Regulation. Significantly, since this EU Regulation is based on Article 127(6) TFEU, it was adopted by unanimity of the Council, with only a consultative role for the European Parliament. To secure the consent of the United Kingdom, however, it was critical to simultaneously adopt a reform of the EBA Regulation of 2010 (Regulation (EU) No 1022/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2013 amending Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) as regards the conferral of specific tasks on the European Central Bank pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013), which in practice gave the European Parliament a veto and thus a significant role in the legislative process. Any future modification of the SSM Regulation may also require unanimity of the Council. The European Commission released their proposal for the SSM in September 2012. The European Parliament and Council agreed on the specifics of the SSM on 19 March 2013. The Parliament voted in favour of the SSM and EBA Regulations on 12 September 2013, and the Council of the European Union gave their approval on 15 October 2013. As set in the SSM Regulation, the ECB assumed its supervisory authority on 4 November 2014. Single Resolution Mechanism thumbSignatories of the Agreement on the transfer and mutualisation of contributions to the Single Resolution Fund Parties The Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) was created to centrally implement the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive in banking union countries, including a Single Resolution Fund (SRF) to finance resolution operations. The SRF is valued at 1% of covered deposits of all credit institutions authorised in the participating member states (estimated at around 55 billion euros), to be filled with contributions by participating banks during an eight-year establishment phase ending on 31 December 2023. A key motivation is to alleviate the impact of failing banks on the sovereign debt of individual states and thus to mitigate the bank-sovereign vicious circle. All EU member states participating in the SSM, any those non-euro countries with a \\"close cooperation\\" agreement, are also participants in the SRM. The Single Resolution Board, a new agency established as the institutional hub of the SRM, is directly responsible for the resolution of significant institutions supervised by the ECB. The SRM was enacted through a legislative act known as the SRM Regulation (\\"Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Bank Resolution Fund and amending Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council\\"). In addition, an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) was made to govern the specifics of how the SRF would be financed (\\"Agreement on the transfer and mutualisation of contributions to the Single Resolution Fund\\"). The SRM Regulation was proposed by the European Commission in July 2013. The Parliament and the Council of the European Union reached an agreement on the Regulation on 20 March 2014. The European Parliament approved the Regulation on 15 April, and the Council followed suit on 14 July 2014, leading to its entry into force on 19 August 2014. The Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) was signed by 26 EU member states on 21 May 2014, remaining open to accession by the remaining EU members Sweden and the United Kingdom. Its entry into force was conditional on the Agreement being ratified by states representing 90% of the weighted vote of SSM and SRM participating states. This was achieved on 30 November 2015, when all participating states apart from Greece and Luxembourg had ratified. Greece ratified on 7 December. The agreement entered into force on 1 January 2016 for SSM and SRM participating states. Luxembourg subsequently ratified on 11 January 2016. European deposit insurance and regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures From the start in early 2012, advocates of banking union have insisted on the need to set up a European deposit insurance in order to break the bank-sovereign vicious circle. This component of the banking union has been initially more controversial than the SSM or SRM, however, because of the strong signal it entails of cross-border risk-sharing. In November 2015, the European Commission published a legislative proposal for a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), but this did not get traction in the ensuing legislative process, even after the Commission in October 2017 watered down its project by suggesting a partial implementation. In June 2019, the European Commission conceded that an entirely new proposal might be needed to bring the vision of European deposit insurance to fruition. One reason for the failure of the EDIS proposal is that it embedded an imbalanced approach to breaking the bank-sovereign vicious circle, as it only tackled one key component of that vicious circle ‚Äì the fact that deposit insurance is only provided at the national level ‚Äì while leaving intact another one ‚Äì namely, the continued existence of concentrated domestic sovereign exposures in most euro-area banks, or in other words, the fact that euro-area banks appear to give preference to their home country in their allocation of credit to governments despite the absence of exchange rate risk within the monetary union. The financial and political salience of this challenge, widely referred to as \\"regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures\\" (RTSE), was not immediately recognized in the early debates about the banking union. In 2015-2016 a high-level working group of the EFC chaired by explored options to tackle concentrated exposures, but no consensus was achieved and the final report was not made public. The link between the two themes of European deposit insurance and RTSE has been acknowledged by EU officials and embedded in negotiating frameworks of the Council. As of mid-2020, however, no tangible progress has been achieved on reaching a policy consensus. Geographical scope and Close Cooperation A close cooperation agreement can be ended by the ECB or by the participating non-eurozone member state. Participating non-eurozone states will also gain a seat on the ECB's Supervisory Board. The 19 eurozone member states participate automatically in the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). Since the EU treaties only give the ECB jurisdiction over eurozone states, legally it cannot enforce measures in non-eurozone states. This would prevent the ECB from effectively carrying out its supervisory role in these states. Under the European Treaties, non-eurozone countries do not have the right to vote in the ECB's Governing Council and in return are not bound by the ECB's decisions. Non-eurozone countries cannot become full members of the SSM and SRM in the sense of having the same rights and obligations as eurozone members. However, non-eurozone EU member states can enter into a \\"close cooperation agreement\\" on the SSM with the ECB. The banks in that country are then supervised by the ECB and the country gains a seat in the ECB's Supervisory Board. It would allow banks in that country to be supervised by the ECB provided that they have mechanisms in place to make ECB measures binding upon national authorities. A \\"close cooperation\\" agreement can be ended by the ECB or by the participating non-eurozone member state. Participating non-eurozone states will also gain a seat on the ECB's Supervisory Board. The text of the SRM stipulates that all states participating in the SSM, including those non-eurozone states with a \\"close cooperation\\" agreement, will automatically be participants in the SRM. = Bulgaria = The first request to enter into \\"close cooperation\\" was made by Bulgaria on 18 July 2018. Bulgaria's Finance Minister, Vladislav Goranov, stated in July 2017 that his country would not participate prior to euro adoption. However, after pressure from the ECB to begin participating in the Banking Union prior to joining the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II), Goranov said in June 2018 that Bulgaria would join the Banking Union within a year. Bulgaria sent a letter to the Eurogroup in July 2018 on its desire to participate in ERM II, and commitment to enter into a \\"close cooperation\\" agreement with the Banking Union.http://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/36111/letter-by-bulgaria-on-erm-ii- participation.pdf The ECB governing council decided on 24 June 2020 to establish a close cooperation with the Bulgarian central bank. The close cooperation entered into force on 1 October 2020. The Bulgarian National Bank thus receives a representative with voting rights on the European Central Bank‚Äôs Supervisory Board and on 1 October 2020, the European Central Bank started supervising the larger Bulgarian banks after the completion of a significance assessment process. = Croatia = Croatia likewise submitted a request for closer cooperation in May 2019, as part of its efforts to join the ERM II. Croatia was expected to join the Banking Union and ERM II by July 2020. The ECB governing council decided on 24 June 2020 to establish a close cooperation with the Croatian central bank. The close cooperation entered into force on 1 October 2020. The Croatian National Bank thus receives a representative with voting rights on the European Central Bank‚Äôs Supervisory Board and on 1 October 2020, the European Central Bank started supervising the larger Croatian banks after the completion of a significance assessment process. = Denmark = The Danish government announced in April 2015 its intention to join the Banking Union. Although the Ministry of Justice found that the move did not entail any transfer of sovereignty and thus would not automatically require a referendum, the Danish People's Party, Red Green Alliance and Liberal Alliance oppose joining the Banking Union and collectively the three won enough seats in the subsequent June 2015 election to prevent the Folketing (the Danish parliament) from joining without the approval through a referendum. As of July 2017, Denmark is studying joining, with a decision expected in the fall of 2019. On 10 July 2017, the Danish Central Bank (Danmarks Nationalbank) published a statement in English on its official website, stating under the section entitled ‚ÄúDanmarks Nationalbank's views on Danish participation‚Äù: > Danmarks Nationalbank believes that Denmark should join the banking union. > In short, it is Danmarks Nationalbank's assessment that participation will > benefit Danish households and firms. Generally speaking, the banking union > will make a positive contribution to financial stability. This is relevant > to all of us. As we saw after 2008, a financial crisis can have a severe > impact on the economic infrastructure most of us rely on: investments, > mortgage loans, business growth opportunities, employment, and government > revenue and expenditure. The banking union can be seen as a bulwark against > future financial crises. It will also ensure that the impact is less severe > if banks do, nevertheless, become distressed. In addition, there are a > number of special factors that make it particularly interesting for Denmark > to participate in the banking union. Some Danish banks and mortgage banks > are very large relative to the size of the economy. In Danmarks > Nationalbank's assessment, supervision of the largest Danish banks and > mortgage banks would be strengthened in the banking union. Danmarks > Nationalbank also finds that participation in the banking union would be an > advantage if a large Danish bank or mortgage bank ever became distressed. A > single, powerful resolution authority would then be better equipped to > minimise the adverse effects on the economy and the financial system without > the use of public funds. A level playing field across borders would also > enhance competition in the Danish banking market, which would only be to the > benefit of Danish households and firms. Furthermore, as a member of the > banking union, Denmark would have a say when European rules, standards and > practices are being established. Inter alia, this means that the mortgage > credit model would be more strongly positioned inside than outside the > banking union. In a press release from 19 December 2019, the Danish Ministry of Industry, Business and Financial Affairs quoted Danish Minister for Industry, Business and Financial Affairs, Simon Kollerup, as saying: > ... It is the government‚Äôs position that there is a need for greater clarity > concerning a number of important issues before we can determine our position > on Danish participation: Sweden‚Äôs position is unclear; work on additional > elements of the Banking Union is still ongoing, and the United Kingdom‚Äôs > future relationship with the EU remains to be finalised. In addition, there > is still uncertainty concerning how the new Basel recommendations will be > implemented in the EU, which can have significant impact on the framework > conditions for the Danish financial sector, regardless of whether we > participate in the Banking Union or not. The government will return to the > issue when there is greater clarity on these issues, and when we have had a > good public debate on possible Danish participation. It is the government‚Äôs > position that if we end up recommending that Denmark should participate in > the Banking Union, a referendum on the issue should be held. = Sweden = Since the rise in resolution fund fees for Swedish banks to protect against banking failures in 2017, resulting in the move of the headquarters of the biggest bank in Sweden and the entire Nordic region, Nordea, from Stockholm to the Finnish capital Helsinki, which lies within the eurozone and therefore also within the Banking Union, there has been discussion about Sweden joining the European Central Bank‚Äôs Banking Union. Nordea‚Äôs chairman of the board, Bj√∂rn Wahlroos, stated that the bank wanted to put itself \\"on a par with its European peers\\" in justifying the relocation from Stockholm to Helsinki. The main aim for joining the Banking Union is to protect Swedish banks against being ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù. Sweden's Financial Markets Minister Per Bolund has said that the country is conducting a study on joining, which is planned to be completed by 2019. Critics argue that Sweden will be disadvantaged by joining the banking union because it does not have any voting rights, as it is not a member of the eurozone. Swedish Finance Minister Madgalena Andersson stated: ‚ÄúYou can't ignore the fact that the decision-making can be a little problematic for countries not in the eurozone.‚Äù  See Also  * Economic and Monetary Union * Capital Markets Union * Internal Market of the European Union * Shadow Banking References External links   *Banking Union Essential Terms: Technical Abbreviations & Glossary (EN/DE/FR) 06-07-2018.

It is characterized by production of two types of fruit, for different ecological roles. It is sometimes restricted to the situation where one fruit type is aerial and the other subterranean (hypogeous), and distinguished from heterocarpy. The word amphicarp is the contraction of the Greek words ·ºÄŒºœÜŒØ meaning \\"of both kinds\\" and Œ∫Œ±œÅœÄœåœÇ meaning fruit. In a typical plant with amphicarpy, one fruit type is underground. These underground fruits usually develop from self-pollinating flowers. The fruits that develop from the aerial flowers may often be the result of cross-pollination. Plants use this strategy to increase the chance that their genetic material is passed on. It can be referred to as bet hedging in which an organism produces several different phenotypes. Seeds from the underground flowers have low genetic variability (due to their selfing), tend to be larger, and may germinate from within the tissues of the flower, so ensuring that the annual can remain at the site that was suitable to it in the preceding year. Seeds from aerial flowers usually have greater genetic variability, tend to be smaller, and may be spread further. This assists the colonization of new territory, but also helps the exchange of genetic material between populations. Worldwide, approximately 67 species exhibit amphicarpy, or 0.02% of the known species of flowering plants. Most of these 67 species occur in often disturbed or very stressful circumstances. Interestingly, 31 of the 67 species known to exhibit amphicarpy are in the family Fabaceae. In Israel, a country that harbors many disturbed habitats, with eight out of a total flora of twenty five hundred species, a much higher percentage of 0.32% is amphicarpic. Species that use amphicarpy include Catananche lutea, Gymnarrhena micrantha and Polygala lewtonii. Trifolium polymorphum is a perennial, that combines amphicarpy with vegetative reproduction through stolons. It grows in grasslands where its aerial flowers may not come into seed due to herbivores.

Telemetry has occasionally facing criticism for bypassing media agencies selling digital ad space and working with advertisers directly. According to 2014 estimates by the Interactive Advertising Bureau, approximately 36% of all reported Web traffic is considered fake, with the corresponding amount of fake ad views due to hijacked computers programmed to visit sites, cheating advertisers who pay based on the number of times their ad is loaded in response to a visit.

It can significantly impair young children‚Äôs abilities to relate with adults and peers, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed.). Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Publishing quoted in The Theravive website Common examples include sitting on another person's lap or leaving with a stranger. DSED is exclusively a childhood disorder and is usually not diagnosed before the age of nine months or until after age five if symptoms do not appear. Infants and young children are at risk of developing DSED if they receive inconsistent or insufficient care from a primary caregiver. Signs and symptoms The most common symptom is unusual interaction with strangers. A child with DSED shows no sign of fear or discomfort when talking to, touching, or accompanying an adult stranger. DSED can cause symptoms commonly associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) It can be comorbid with cognitive, language and speech delay. Risk factors DSED is a result of inconsistent or absent primary caregivers in the first few years of childhood. Children who are institutionalized may receive inconsistent care or become isolated during hospitalization. Parental issues such as mental health problems, depression, personality disorder, absence, poverty, teen parenting, or substance abuse interfere with attachment. DSED \\"...may have a biological cause in some cases (e.g., Williams syndrome).\\"  Diagnosis  The criteria for Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder in the DSM-5 are: A. A pattern of behavior in which a child actively approaches and interacts with unfamiliar adults and exhibits at least two of the following: # Reduced or absent reticence in approaching and interacting with unfamiliar adults. # Overly familiar verbal or physical behavior (that is not consistent with culturally sanctioned and with age-appropriate social boundaries). # Diminished or absent checking back with an adult caregiver after venturing away, even in unfamiliar settings. # Willingness to go off with an unfamiliar adult with little or no hesitation. B. The behaviors in Criterion A are not limited to impulsivity (as in Attention- Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) but include socially disinhibited behavior. C. The child has experienced insufficient care as evidenced by at least one of the following: # Social neglect or deprivation where the child's emotional needs are not met by care-giving adults. # Repeated changes of primary caregivers that limit the ability to form stable attachments (e.g., frequent changes in foster care). # Rearing in unusual settings that severely limit opportunities to form selective attachments (e.g., institutions with the high child to caregiver ratios). D. The care in Criterion C is presumed to be responsible for the disturbed behavior in Criterion A (e.g., the disturbances in Criterion A began following the pathogenic care in Criterion C). E. The child has a developmental age of at least nine months.Steve Grcevich. \\"Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder\\".

It is one of the oldest Catholic parishes in the state of Florida and the oldest parish in the Archdiocese of Miami. The church is a contributing property in the Key West Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places. History The basilica's interior The first Catholic presence in the Florida Keys was established on Upper Matecumbe Key by Spanish Jesuits in 1566. The Jesuit superiors in Spain abandoned the Florida missions in 1572 and the missionaries were recalled to Mexico. They attempted to establish a permanent mission on Key West as early as 1724. However, the Native peoples on the Keys were unpredictable and the English raiders from the Carolinas forced the missionaries to return to Cuba in 1727. Two Italian Jesuits from Havana opened a mission chapel on Key West in 1743 for the Native peoples. The Spanish governor ordered them to return to Cuba as well as he could not protect them. The Rev. John F. Kirby was sent by Bishop Francis X. Gartland of the Diocese of Savannah to Key West in 1851 and established St. Mary Star of the Sea parish in 1851. The first permanent Catholic Church on Key West was dedicated on February 26, 1852, on the corner of Duval and Eaton Streets. It was the fifth Catholic parish established in the state of Florida and the first parish in South Florida. Because of its location between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean it was placed under the patronage of Our Lady, Star of the Sea. Rev. Anthony B. Friend, S.J. arrived in Key West as pastor on February 15, 1898. He was the first many American Jesuits to serve the parish. Five Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary from Montreal, Quebec, Canada arrived in 1868 to open a school for girls and to establish a convent. It is the first Catholic School in the state of Florida. The sisters bought the present school property in 1874. The Convent of Mary Immaculate, later known as Mary Immaculate High School, operated from 1886 to 1986, St. Francis Xavier School for blacks operated from 1872 to 1961, a school for Cuban girls operated from 1873 to 1878 and St. Joseph School for boys operated from 1880 to 1961. All the schools were integrated in the 1960s. The original church building was destroyed in a fire in 1901. Until a new church could be built, Mass was celebrated in the convent music hall. The present structure was built in 1905. The Jesuits ended their service to the parish after seventy-two years in 1970 and the Rev. Charles Zinn of Archdiocese of Miami became pastor. St. Mary Star of the Sea Church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 as a contributing property in the Key West Historic District. In 1983 the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary ended their service in Key West after 115 years. The church was raised to a minor basilica by Pope Benedict XVI on February 11, 2012. Architecture The exterior of the church reflects the eclectic period of American Victorian Architecture. It also shows elements of a modified, early Renaissance Revival style. This may be found in the rusticated walls, rounded arches and lunettes that are composed of transitional gothic arches, louvered shutters and colored glass. Many interior elements have both Romanesque and early Renaissance characteristics. Behind the altar is a stained glass window that depicts the church's patroness. School The Basilica School of St. Mary Star of the Sea is the parish school. It was established in 1959 on the site of the former St. Joseph's School, for white male children, and St. Francis Xavier's School, for black children.

Its address is 228 Notre Dame Avenue, and abuts Ellice Avenue and Garry Street, forming a mostly triangular floor plate. Construction Constructed during a 14-month period between 1911 and 1912, the building was designed as an office building for entrepreneur Frank Lindsay by local architects John Woodman and Raymond Carey, who had previously designed the Paris building on Portage Avenue. The building's location was conveniently directly beside the Oxford Hotel, another property already owned by Lindsay. Originally planned as a 7-storey building, three additional storeys were added to the plan after construction had already begun. The building was constructed by the Kelly-Simpson Company at a cost of $193,000 and was prepared for occupancy in December 1912. Design Exterior details of second floor of Lindsay Building (Winnipeg, Manitoba) Top storeys' exterior details The building features reinforced concrete slab construction, which was unusual at the time, when steel framed buildings were common. The exterior of the building features a sheathing of cream coloured terracotta, cartouches, pilasters capped with Ionic capitals, as well as garlands of flowers around the semicircular second floor windows. The exterior is also ornamented with ten green wreaths bearing \\"1912\\" (the year of construction) as well as a pair of terracotta angel wings beneath each window, and five plaques identifying it as the Lindsay Building. The building has undergone some alterations since it was built, including removal of entranceways and glass transoms in what are now bay windows. The original awnings have also been removed. For many years the building featured a large aerial on top which was decorated with the code letters for CJOB. In 2002, the Lindsay Building was announced to have the top seven stories converted into 35 affordable rental apartments, as it had been empty for several years. The owners of the building, Brad and Dale Ostrum, received $300,000 for the project from CentreVenture Development Corp. Tenants The building originally housed shops, including a confectioner, the Harstone Brothers Fuel Company, the Sprague Lumber Company office and a drug store. During the 1920s, much of the Garry Street shop space was occupied by the Provincial Savings Office, along with the Clark and Martin stock brokerage firm. One unit was used as a tailor shop by first Harry Greenberg, and later Palay Tailors. The main floor featured the offices of CJOB for many years on the Notre Dame side, along with Lindy's lunch bar. Throughout the years, the upper office floors were occupied by \\"Lindsay Life Insurance\\", Sun Life, London Life, Metropolitan Life, as well as other insurance companies, along with lawyers' offices and professional offices. The building also housed the Wartime Bureau of Personnel, the Veteran's Welfare Division and the Dominion Treasury Office. The building is currently primarily used as rental apartments.

Kenneth Baker, S.J. is a Roman Catholic priest in the Society of Jesus. Besides his pastoral duties as a priest he has served as a professor of theology and a university president. He has also worked to bring the message of the Roman Catholic Church into more forms of communication media, most notably as editor-in-chief in the magazine the Homiletic and Pastoral Review which has been called \\"one of the most important magazines for priests in the English speaking world\\". Background Baker was born on November 12, 1929, to Catherine and Kenneth Baker Sr. in 1929 in Tacoma, Washington. Baker was born a month after the onset of the Great Depression. Under the economic stressors of the time Baker's parents' marriage dissolved and they got a divorce. Baker was given to Daniel and Mary Browne, his maternal grandparents, to raise. Baker had little contact with his parents and shared his grandparents home with their two youngest children, who were his aunt and uncle. Baker's grandfather Daniel Browne worked as a dock worker and a construction foreman. Browne had traveled west from Nova Scotia and arrived at Spokane around 1900. He moved his family to Tacoma near the new port of Puget Sound in 1920. The booming trade with Asia increased the wealth of Tacoma and it was a large fashionable city when Baker grew up there. Baker had not been baptized by his parents and neither his father nor his grandfather were Catholic. His grandmother was a practicing Catholic and desired that he attend parochial school at St. Leo Jesuit parish (rather than the local nearby public school). To facilitate this Baker was baptized at the age of five, and reportedly \\"thought very little of it, seeing it as just another part of starting school.\\" =Schooling= The parish school of St. Leo's was staffed by Franciscan Sisters who instructed Baker and his fellow students in their studies and in the Catholic faith. At this time Baker showed no signs of developing a vocation to the priesthood and at one point when the Sisters asked the boys in his class which of them would like to grow up and be priests, Baker was the only one who did not raise his hand. The young Baker got into \\"various kinds of trouble like other boys his age\\" and making use of the Catholic sacrament of confession officiated by Fr. Augustine Krebsbach. Baker had intended to the Catholic parochial school Bellarmine High, but circumstances prevented this. Baker's grandfather had suffered a stroke and was no longer able to work and his grandmother made the only income for the family, bringing in $6.00 a week as a restaurant cook. Rather than force Baker to attend public high school his uncle, who owned a restaurant, offered to pay the first year of the Jesuit Bellarmine high school's tuition of $80. His uncle also offered Baker a job so that by working weeknights and weekends he could earn the money to continue going to Catholic school. Baker began as a dishwasher and moved up to fry cook. Baker was able to earn enough to buy a 1938 Dodge four door sedan at the age of sixteen. Three different US military branches had bases in Tacoma and when World War II was being fought many servicemen came into the restaurant, some of the waitresses made money on the side by engaging in prostitution using the job as a contact point for customers. To Baker this worldly behavior was a sharp contrast from the way the Jesuit scholastics teaching at Bellarmine high comported themselves. Baker spent much of his spare time in student activities including dances and parties, sometimes taking girls from two nearby Catholic girls' schools out for a movie and a hamburger with rootbeer. With his junior year in high school Baker became a serious student as he began to consider joining the navy to become a pilot or being the first in his family to attend college. At this time he also became more serious about his faith, attending Mass daily as devotion for Lent. Baker in an attempt to get elected to the school council paid five dollars to a friend who flew an airplane to drop leaflets on the school yard in support of his election. A strong wind blew the leaflets away from the school and onto the football field where the principal made Baker collect them. He did not win the election. As a high school senior Baker began regularly dating a cheerleader named Pat from a rival school. To Baker's surprise that same year the chaplain at Bellarmine high suggested he consider joining the novitiate of the Society of Jesus. While unaware of any priestly vocation Baker wanted to learn more about the Jesuit way of life. After informing his girlfriend (who was unhappy but supportive) Baker began a two- year trial period as a Jesuit novice on August 15, 1947. Jesuit training In the monastic framework of the novitiate, Baker grew to enjoy the regular regimen of prayer, instruction, and work. After the two-year trial period ended, Baker was committed to join the Jesuits and on the Feast of Assumption 1949 he took the perpetual vows of poverty, chastity and obedience in the Society of Jesus and began an eleven-year program to become a priest. In accordance with Jesuit training Baker took two years of classical study and then three years of philosophy. He then went on to teach Latin and Greek as a scholastic at Gonzaga Preparatory School in Spokane. Baker enjoyed teaching and pictured a future serving in that role. Aware of Baker's interest in teaching his Provincial offered him a chance to study theology at the Austrian Jesuit University of Innsbruck. Although Baker's focus had been the Classics he accepted the offer. Living in the Austrian highlands Baker soon became fluent in German and became an expert skier. Within a year at Innsbruck he was passionate about his new focus studying theology and became deeply interested in theological matters and movements within the Catholic Church. On July 26, 1960 Baker was ordained a priest at Holy Trinity church in Innsbruck. In 1961 Baker completed his formal study of theology and received the Licentiate degree. Returning to America and Washington State, Baker was prepared to enter the period of tertianship, where young Jesuit priests are placed in pastoral situations to prepare them for the future. His tertianship was placed on hold, however, when the Jesuit Provincial asked him to fill in temporarily as a philosophy professor for Gonzaga University. For two years Baker taught logic, philosophy of man, and philosophy of God and then entered his tertianship (which he completed in 1963). Desiring to study more about Christian Scripture Baker received permission to pursue a graduate degree at Marquette University. In 1967 he earned a Ph. D. and then was sent to Gonzaga University to serve as an assistant professor of the theological faculty. Teaching at Gonzaga University Returning to Gonzaga, Baker felt that a change had overcome many of his fellow priests and the nuns working there. Some among the nuns were removing their habits and placing less emphasis on their religious identity. Baker also felt disquieted by priests, seminarians, and nuns gathering for informal \\"beer parties\\" on campus. Investigating such parties, Baker felt that they were leading to an \\"unhealthy spirit, a breakdown in the commitment to a complete and exclusive following of Christ, a haze dimming the witness to the reality of eternal life.\\" Advocating for a stricter obedience to the papacy, Baker became chairman of the theology department for Gonzaga in 1968. His position was \\"\\"Both arms around the Pope, that's my principle.\\" In the summer of 1968, Pope Paul VI issued Humanae Vitae, reaffirming the Catholic doctrine against the use of man-made birth control. While a wave of dissent arose throughout Catholic universities across North America, Gonzaga's faculty remained loyal and gave a series of lectures in support of the encyclical. Baker supported the document by preaching from the pulpit of Spokane's Jesuit Church. With a growing experience in academics and administration, Baker fine- tuned his ideas on what was required to restore and emphasize Catholic identity within Catholic educational institutions. While many Catholic educational institutions were seen as \\"secularizing\\" by turning over control to lay boards of directors, Baker advocated the opposite, defending the preservation of ecclesiastical affiliation and the Jesuit spirit of solidarity and service. Baker's sermon during the opening Mass of the Jesuit University of Seattle drew special attention for its emphasis on this subject, and he was instrumental in assuring that Jesuit control remained in the revised charter of Gonzaga. President of Seattle University In late November 1969 the Jesuit Provincial called Baker into his office and informed him that the president of Seattle University was being replaced and that he, then forty- years-old, was being appointed to the position. =Previous conditions= In the years previous to Baker's presidency, a construction boom had taken place at Seattle University under the presidency of Fr. Albert A. Lemiuex (who had led the university since 1948 ‚Äì soon after it changed its name from Seattle College). University leaders had projected the increased enrollment of the 1950s would continue. Loans were taken out to fund the construction of buildings to handle these projections, such as the student residency building Campion Hall (which required a loan of 3.6 million dollars). But the projections proved wrong and rather than the forecast enrollment of 6,000 students in 1969, a decline in student numbers occurred, resulting in a student body of 1,076, which left the university saddled with near empty buildings and in dire financial trouble. In addition to financial problems at the University, Baker had to deal with student unrest. During the early stages of the Vietnam War, the majority of Seattle University students had been supportive of the military endeavor. After the 1968 Tet Offensive, the majority of student opinion swung against the war and protests on campus rose drastically. By 1970 hundreds of students were taking part in rallies and teach-ins. The protesters took especial issue with the presence of ROTC on campus. Also previous to Baker's presidency the Black Student Union (BSU) accused the university of institutional racism for a denial of funding for their proposal to host the first separate black homecoming. On January 14, 1970, the BSU, through its spokesperson Bobby Davis, stated that the $3,700 given to the homecoming committee consisting of only white students was giving money \\"to a white group to go out and put on a white homecoming for a black team. This is the kind of monolithic amerliorism that black people have to contend with. Your Neil Diamond, or whoever, he is, can only be relevant to white, completely bourgeois people.\\" Later when the student government refused to increase the BSU's budget the group threatened a boycott in which black basketball players would refuse to play. The boycott did not take place, but on January 19, 1970 weeks before Baker took office a bomb exploded between the Liberal Arts and Garrand buildings causing costly structural damage, but no injuries or loss of life. =Baker's tenure= Baker, who had been chosen \\"for both his economic and political conservatism\\" was installed as the 17th head of Seattle University on February 1, 1970. He was the fifth man to hold the title President (between the school's founding in 1891 to 1936 the job's title was Administrator). Baker began a series of severe budget cuts, all the while receiving continuous demands for more funding from the heads of different academic programs. In a February 26, 1970 interview with the student newspaper The Spectator he said \\"S.U. is not a monstrous, sleek fat cow with hundreds of teats that every group can suck on endlessly. The little milk left is all spoken for while there are many hungry mouths.\\" Some students and faculty began to hold that Baker's cuts were discriminatory and biased. Vietnam protests A few months into Baker's presidency news of the U.S. invasion of Cambodia and the Kent State shootings inspired student radicalism and riots on the campus of Seattle University. Baker became convinced that many of the riots \\"were manufactured by professional agitators.\\" In March 1970 Xavier Hall was set on fire by arsonists timing it to the on campus appearance of Barry Goldwater. Baker received death threats from revolutionary organizations and for three weeks was under 24-hour police protection. On one occasion his office was broken into and his furniture was smashed, twice large groups of students forced their way into his office to shout complaints and demands and in effect keeping him captive. Baker found their demands and objections unreasonable and \\"perceived that the agitation was designed to wreak havoc on the school\\" so he stood firm. Racial tensions In addition to student unrest over the Vietnam War, racial tensions again surfaced at Seattle University during Baker's presidency in the spring of 1970. William Cooley, Chairman of the Faculty Urban Affairs Committee publicly stated that the campus was \\"permeated by racism.\\" His comments were recalled during unrest caused by a hiring decision. Dr. Anita Yourglich, chairperson of the sociology department had sought out a candidate for an interim vacancy position. Her final two candidates \\"were Ray Napierkowski, a 1969 honors graduate from Seattle U, or William Hodge, a Black teaching assistant from the University of Washington with a master‚Äôs degree in sociology.\\" When she selected Napierkowski her fellow faculty encouraged her to reconsider fearing that the choice would be perceived as racist. Yourglich stated that she had chosen Napierkowski for his statistics and research background. The news of this decision caused outrage among much of the faculty and student body who held the University lacked commitment to affirmative action in hiring educators. Interviewed by the student newspaper The Spectator, Yourglich stated that the first priority of her job was to advance the understanding of Sociology \\"As far as need for a black image at S.U. in general and the sociology department in particular is concerned, I do not feel my first obligation lies in this area.\\" And that \\"blackness\\" is not a requirement to advance the aims of the sociology department. The editors of The Spectator felt the decision was part of a pattern of resistance against the hiring of minority faculty members at the University and published an editorial memorandum blasting the school for racial imbalance in employment, running it alongside the interview with Yourglich. Major demonstration On May 15, 1970, a day after the editorial in The Spectator, a major campus demonstration began at 6:45 in the morning with over 150 demonstrators \\"made up of members of Seattle U‚Äôs Afro- American Movement for Equality (SAAME), unaffiliated Seattle U students, and activists from Seattle Community College (now Seattle Central Community College) and the University of Washington.\\" Not all the protesters had the same agenda. The members of SAAME were demanding Hodge be hired, while other S.U., SCC and UW students were angry about the extension of the war into Cambodia and were protesting the presence of ROTC on campus - calling for it to be disbanded. The protesters blocked the entrance to the Chieftain building which stored ROTC's weapons used for the cadets' Wednesday drills. To avoid conflict the cadets rerouted their activities. Emboldened by this success the protesters marched to the Liberal Arts and Pigott building, blocked the entrances and chanted anti-War slogans. Some students climbed the flagpole and turned the American flag upside to mimic an official signal of distress. Baker initially was charitable to the students asking that faculty not punish them academically for either attending or participating in the demonstrations. He told the protesters \\"I sympathize with you for your consciences. ...I support you.\\" As the demonstration continued in some places the protests became \\"small riots\\". In response, the next day, Baker issued a memo forbidding unapproved demonstrations and rallies. Hearing of this several students led by black student leaders on May 18, 1970 descended upon the Liberal Arts building demanding an audience with Baker. When they were refused \\"the students invaded the president‚Äôs office. Belligerently shouting, students caused significant damages to the space‚Äîoverturning tables, knocking the president‚Äôs books off of his bookshelf and breaking his table lamps.\\" Five of the students involved, including Bobby Davis and Emile Wilson, where suspended on May 19, 1970. On May 20, 1970 students of the Afro-American Movement for Equality held another demonstration of around 300 people, which included Seattle University students and outside activists. During this rally six protesters were arrested after trashing the Seattle University Student Union cafeteria. Interviewed by the local media Baker told reporters that he would remain firm and not let the protesters ‚Äúbreak SU so we‚Äôll have to turn it over to the state and make it a black university,‚Äù he promised he would ‚Äúnot tolerate anarchical activity on campus. This is not a return to the jungle.\\" At the Student Conduct Review Board Emile Wilson, who had been at both the take over of Baker's office and was among those arrested days later was defended by his personal friend Fr. McGoldrick, S.J.. In a decision approved by Fr. McGoldrick the board reinstated all of the suspended students and the criminal charges against Wilson were dropped. (Wilson with the tutoring of Fr. McGoldrick would later become the University's first Rhodes Scholar.) =Resignation= Baker's stance against the agitated students did not receive universal support, some school benefactors and other people of influence demanded he be fired and replaced by someone with a more conciliatory approach. Feeling his drive to implement his vision of Catholic education would be unachievable in the current climate Baker resigned the University Presidency on November 1, 1970, after having served nine months. In his resignation letter Baker addressed the student protesters directly, saying \\"Although I have had differences with some of you, I respect you and admire the maturity that has been developed here over the years.\\" Baker was seen as a \\"stern conservative\\" during his tenure, which has been summarized in the Seattle University literature as follows: \\"Baker‚Äôs budget cuts were necessary, but his outspoken style antagonized students and faculty alike.\\" The university trustees replaced Baker with Father Louis Gaffney, SJ. who preached \\"contagious optimism\\", and was able to secure \\"generous help from the university‚Äôs benefactors\\" and different terms from the University's creditors. Gaffney continued on Baker's path of further cutting budgets. He also made a major reorganization of campus departments and increased outreach efforts and fund-raising. Despite Baker's departure, trouble at Seattle University did not completely cease and on May 6, 1972, a large bomb detonated under the steps of the ROTC building, blowing out all the windows on the facing side of Loyola Hall. Seattle University would continue to struggle with financial problems, until the 1976 presidency of Fr. William J. Sullivan (the fifth president in six years). Sullivan made even further cuts in administration and cut funding for the schools nationally recognized basketball program. The SU basketball program had been seen as \\"a leader in the area of racial integration and diversity\\" which had played for the NCAA championship in 1958, and over decades of success had produced several players that went on to the NBA (including Hall of Famer Elgin Baylor). Seattle University dropped out of the West Coast Conference and Division I and entered the small-college National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics level. With the withdrawal to the NAIA the school stopped the $450,000 yearly deficit the program was running. The percentage of Jesuit faculty continued to decline, and at the end of Sullivan's tenure had fallen to 10%. Baker's stance against the radicalised students was noticed by conservative commentator William F. Buckley, Jr. who invited him as a guest on his television show \\"Firing Line\\" that filmed in New York City. Editor of Homiletic and Pastoral Review While in New York in December 1970 Baker accompanied fellow Jesuit Daniel Lyons (who was later laicized in 1976) to a restaurant. Lyons suggested that the nearly bankrupt Homiletic and Pastoral Review be purchased and Baker should serve as its Editor-in-Chief. The Jesuit Provincial gave his approval and Lyons made a company that bought the magazine on a payment-plan that extended for three years. Baker moved from Washington state to New York to take up his new position. The first issue under his editing was issued on April 1971 with an editorial by him titled \\"Catholic and Proud of it\\", and Baker's principle for the magazine was that they \\"came out four square in favor of the Pope and the magisterium.\\" The magazine was seen as a conservative voice faithful to Catholicism in an age of tumult brought about by dissent against Humane Vitae. It's subscriptions increased by four thousand and many priests wrote in thankful for such a voice calling it \\"beacon of light in a dark storm.\\" Baker's associate Fr. Lyons founded Catholic Views Broadcasts, Inc. in 1974 which produced fifteen-minute interview programs with Catholic commentators addressing social issues for over 100 radio stations. When Lyons left the active ministry in 1975, Baker took over as its director. Baker began publishing a lay-orientated magazine as well in 1978 titled Key to Happiness which got a subscription of 25,000. Baker was assisted in his media work by being given office space in the New York residence of Cardinal Paul Y√º Pin (who had been expelled from China by the Communist Party in 1949). Baker learned Chinese cuisine while working alongside the Cardinal's staff and published a book on understanding the menu of Chinese restaurants with Fr. Paul Chan of the Chinese Catholic Information Center. Baker went on to build three community television stations to offer Catholic programming and promote the faith. Besides his media work over the years Baker has also attended the annual bishop's meeting as well as the International Synod in Rome. In addition he has given retreats and led European pilgrimages, besides providing spiritual direction for three convents in the New York City area. In 2010 Baker stepped down from being the editor of the Homiletic & Pastoral Review after 40 years and was succeeded by his friend and fellow Jesuit scholar Fr. David Vincent Meconi. After 2010 Baker continued as Editor Emeritus with the magazine writing a monthly editorial and book reviews.

Television In the late 1980s Baker started two community television stations to promote Catholicism. In addition to televising EWTN, the stations were created to make original programming as well. In 1987 Baker as President of Catholic Views Broadcast Inc started a community television station at Blue Island, Illinois airing to the Chicago area on UHF channel 54, with the call letters W54AP. In 1989 he started another community television station on UHF channel 53 under the call letters K53CH in Minneapolis, Minnesota. With the FCC analog to digital conversion, the Illinois station in 2004 moved from channel 54 to 48 and its call-sign became W48DD. The station was sold in 2005 and switched from Catholic to ethnic programming, changing its call-sign to WFBBT-CA. The Minneapolis station, also due to the analog to digital conversion, was moved from channel 53 to 19 under the call letters of K19ER in 2003. In 2010 the station moved to channel 16 - its new call letters became K16HY-D. In 2009 Baker turned over the Minneapolis station to St. Michael's Broadcasting and its president Michael Bird who continued to broadcast Catholic programming. Baker has appeared on \\"Mother Angelica Live\\" and hosted a thirteen-part series on the Bible for EWTN. He has also recorded video lectures on Catholic theology concerning the doctrine of the Trinity and the Catholic exegesis of the Old Testament which are distributed by International Catholic University.

V22 was started in 2010 by Frank Rodriguez and his wife Angela.  History and overview Rj Mitte modeling V22 clothing line Frank Rodriguez got a start as a designer in the 1980s designing leather jackets and selling to stores on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. It was around this time that Angela Smith was making hand sewn bags and bone jewelry, also selling to stores on Melrose Ave and other boutique shops throughout Los Angeles. Being a lifelong rider and builder of bikes and cars, Rodriguez gained notoriety for his luxe custom bikes as owner and operator of Excalibur Choppers. Some of the more notable custom builds include a 40 foot long chopper, a Vespa scooter with 35 mirrors and Big-twin engine, and a 1936 low rider hot rod restored after spending decades in a Florida swamp. The inside tapestry and seat covers of the low rider are made of the same denim used to make the company jeans and jackets, and come from a stock of 10,000 yards of vintage denim that is no longer manufactured. After leaving the world of custom bike building, Rodriguez and Smith started V22LA out of a small Hollywood apartment with a collection for men, using high quality denim, selvedge denim, and hand-picked leather. The line expanded into jewelry, objets d‚Äôart, and hand-made items for the home. The couture women's line came along in 2012, which included bags, motorcycle jackets and jewelry in the vein of punk rock, bohemian and rock 'n roll style. = Expansion = From its humble beginnings in a small North Hollywood apartment to a 7000 sq ft show room and compound in just a few short years, V22LA is on the rise and plans to bring all manufacturing to other floors of the building which it now occupies in the fashion District of Downtown Los Angeles, so that all production would be in-house. V22LA has turned down offers to manufacture in the developing world for a fraction of the cost.

Production \\"I'm Still Here\\" was introduced in the musical Follies, which premiered on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre on April 4, 1971. The song is sung by former Follies showgirl, Carlotta Campion. The role was originally played by Yvonne De Carlo.\\" Follies, Broadway, 1971\\" sondheimguide.com, accessed May 29, 2014 Other performers who have played Carlotta in Follies on Broadway include Ann Miller in the 1998 Paper Mill Playhouse production, Polly Bergen in the 2001 revival and Elaine Paige in the 2011 revival. In the 1987 West End production, Carlotta was played by Dolores Gray. She was played by Tracie Bennett in the recent National Theatre production. Since the original production many performers have included the song as part of their concert performances, often rewriting it to reflect their own careers, including Barbra Streisand, Eartha Kitt and Sammy Davis Jr.. Background \\"I'm Still Here\\" was written during the out of town tryout for Follies in Boston, when Sondheim decided that another song (\\"Can That Boy Foxtrot\\") was not working. This song had been written as a throwaway song for a minor character, but Yvonne De Carlo was a high-profile name in the cast, and the creative team felt she deserved a more substantial song. The librettist James Goldman suggested it should be a song about survival that said 'I'm still here.' Sondheim borrowed the phrase for the song title. 'Six By Sondheim The song is an example of a \\"list song\\". Sondheim noted that \\"the song develops through decades\\" (p. 181). Stephen Banfield (Elgar Professor and Head of School of Performance Studies at the University of Birmingham) calls the song a \\"blues song\\" (p. 183).Banfield, Stephen. id=dLf1_FutpusC&pg;=PA179&lpg;=PA179&dq;=Sondheim+%22I'm+Still+Here%22&source;=bl&ots;=JVvU8M2XiO&sig;=OPasF1EhxNa_JmvUpuwlpi8JaQ8&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=SRWHU_y8PJaoyATAtILABw&ved;=0CCMQ6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&q;=Sondheim%20%22I'm%20Still%20Here%22&f;=false \\"The List Song\\" Sondheim's Broadway Musicals, University of Michigan Press, 1993, , pp 179ff The tune was written as a pastiche of Harold Arlen, one of Sondheim's favorite Broadway composers. June Abernathy provided an explanation of some of the terms and references in the song. For example, in the phrase \\"I‚Äôve slept in shanties, Guest of the W.P.A.\\", \\"W.P.A.\\" means the Works Projects Administration (1935‚Äì43), a U.S. government agency. \\"Windsor and Wally‚Äôs affair\\" refers to King Edward VIII, King of England in 1936, and Wallis Warfield Simpson, an American divorcee.Abernathy, June. \\"I'm Still..What?\\" sondheim.com, accessed May 29, 2014 Synopsis Carlotta is a former showgirl who became a movie star and later a nightclub performer and television star. In this song she sings about the many adventures she has been through during her long career, and explains that she has outlived it all. She describes rising from poverty during the Great Depression through luck and perseverance despite limited training. The next verses describe surviving the excesses of show business success, including alcoholism, drug addiction and rehabilitation, as well as going through the Hollywood Blacklist. Sondheim loosely based the song on the career of Joan Crawford, stating \\"She [Crawford] started as a silent film-star, then she became a sound-star, and she eventually became superannuated and started to do camp movies [...] she became a joke on and of herself, but she survived.\\" Six By Sondheim This shows up in the line 'First you're another sloe-eyed vamp/ Then someone's mother/ then you're camp/ then you career from career to career/ I'm almost through my memoirs/ and I'm here!' What makes the song interesting and poignant is the very real mixture of emotions of an older person reviewing her life, seeing how the good and the bad in life are bound to come, alternately or sometimes simultaneously, and in having reached a certain age there is a sense of both cynicism and triumph. This mixture is expressed in the emotional impact of the music itself, which gradually begins to swell as the song progresses from what starts as a nightclub lounge-act performance into a brassy big-band cabaret style finish. As she goes through an outline of her life, skimming through the pages of her mental scrapbook, she builds up to the realization that, good or bad, she managed to get through her life and that she is a survivor. With that realization there is a confidence and a sense of triumph, but with an edge to it. Some youthful tenderness has to be left behind, but \\"what does not kill you, makes you stronger\\". Critical reception Variety describes the song as \\"electric\\".\\"Reviews. \\"Follies'\\" Variety, 2011 The New York Times called it \\"the song of the survivor\\".Wilson, John S. \\"Cabaret: Jane Harvey, Songs\\" The New York Times, February 3, 1984 Elaine Stritch has said that an actress has only earned the right to perform the song once they reach 80.

Other than his intelligence activities with Mulligan, no definite information about him or his life is available.  American Revolution  =Early activities= Mulligan had a fashionable clothing business, which, along with his marriage to Elizabeth Sanders, daughter of a Royal Navy admiral, gave him access to officers who would talk to him about military matters.Rose, 2007, p. 225. Mulligan was an active member of the Sons of Liberty, and took in Washington's aide Alexander Hamilton when he arrived in New York as a young man in 1773 to attend King's College, later Columbia University. Mulligan later helped Hamilton obtain a commission in the army.Rose, 2007, p. 224. Although Mulligan tried to flee New York City after the British occupied it in September 1776, the popular tailor was caught and returned to the city after a brief period of time in detention.Author Harry Thayer Mahoney wrote that the British failure to lock up Mulligan, except for a short time, was a \\"failure of British counterintelligence.\\" Mahoney, Henry Thayer and Marjorie Locke Mahoney. Gallantry in Action: A Biographic Dictionary of Espionage in the American Revolutionary War. Lanham, MD: University Press of America, Inc., 1999. . p. 253. Although Historian Alexander Rose has written that Mulligan began activities within six weeks of the date that Robert Townsend, alias \\"Samuel Culper, Jr.\\", sent his first intelligence letter, Stephen Knott has written that Mulligan began his spying activities in late 1776 or early 1777, well before formation of the Culper Ring.Although his statement seems specific, Rose may have been referring only to Mulligan's activities in connection with the ring. Knott says that Mulligan co-operated with the Culper Ring, but mostly operated as a lone agent.Rose states that Mulligan gave Townsend information, which Townsend added to his reports. Rose, 2007, p. 226. Paul Misencik describes operations by Mulligan as early as 1777.Misencik, 2013, p. 113. Mulligan had met Haym Salomon during the general roundup of suspected Patriots, many of whom had begun to flee the city, after the British occupation of New York.Misencik, 2013, p. 109. Mulligan soon encountered Salomon again when Salomon accompanied a Hessian officer to Mulligan's shop.Misencik, 2013, p. 110. Salomon explained that he had been freed from prison in return for swearing allegiance to the Loyalist cause and translating between English and German for the British and Hessian officers, but that he was still a Patriot. Mulligan decided to advertise his tailoring business to the Hessian officers in German, which would facilitate spying as well as business. Mulligan would send Cato to Salomon's shop with ads to translate into German for passing on to Hessians. Cato would return with the translations and intelligence that Mulligan could report to his contact with Washington at Continental Army headquarters, Alexander Hamilton.Misencik, 2013, p. 112. Mulligan capitalized on his contacts with the British when he learned that British General William Howe was planning to move south in summer 1777. Since the British did not suspect an enslaved person would be acting as a messenger to George Washington, in April 1777, they allowed Cato to cross the Hudson River on a ferry with packages marked \\"H. Mulligan, clothier.\\"Daigler, Kenneth A. Spies, Patriots and Traitors: American Intelligence in the Revolutionary War. Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, 2014. . p. 189. Many of the soldiers were Mulligan's customers, knew Cato and let him pass to New Jersey with his intelligence about Howe's activities and movements in one of the packages and later return to New York. Although Howe was able to land his troops at the northern end of Chesapeake Bay and advance northward toward Philadelphia, the Patriot capital, Washington prepared defenses against Howe's movements at Red Clay Creek.Ferling, John. Almost a Miracle: The American Victory in the War of Independence. New York: Oxford University Press, 2009. . (pbk.) Originally published in hard cover in 2007. p. 246. Howe moved to avoid these defenses and Washington felt compelled to leave his position to fight in a less advantageous position to defend the capital.Ferling also states that Washington did not scout the area well while Howe gained a good picture of the lay of the land from Loyalist spies, including the existence of an unguarded ford over Brandywine Creek two miles from the Continental Army position. Ultimately, the Continental Army was flanked and beaten back in the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777. After further skirmishes and maneuvers, Howe and his army were able to enter and occupy Philadelphia.Ferling, 2007, pp. 247-253. After the British abandoned Philadelphia and returned to New York City in the summer of 1778, activity again picked up in the restored British Army headquarters. The British Provost Marshal of New York City, William Cunningham, suspected Mulligan of espionage and was curious about Cato's trips from New York. He eventually questioned and jailed Cato, treating him cruelly, and interrogating him about Mulligan's activities and his own deliveries out of town. Cato would not talk. In January 1779, Cato delivered a message to Alexander Hamilton that the British planned to kidnap or kill American leaders including Washington and New Jersey Governor William Livingston.Misencik, 2013, p. 117. Mulligan had received the information from his brother Hugh, who was with Kortright and Company, a contractor for British Army. Washington and Livingston took appropriate precautions. = Culper Ring = Mulligan's business was near Robert Townsend's establishment. After the organization of the Culper Ring, Mulligan gave information to Townsend that the British planned a surprise attack on the newly allied French forces under Lieutenant General Rochambeau at Newport, Rhode Island before the French could fully recover and set up defenses after their arduous sea journey to America.Misencik, 2013, p. 120. Townsend sent through the Culper Ring courier system. Mulligan also sent Cato by a more direct route to Washington, who consequently had the information several days before the Culper letter arrived. When Mulligan was arrested on suspicion after the defection of Benedict Arnold to the British in New York, Townsend ceased his activities for a time for fear he also would be discovered. Arnold did not have any hard evidence against Mulligan so despite the testimony of Arnold and Cunningham against him, Mulligan was released.Misencik, 2013, p. 122. But he may have spent as many as five months, until February 1781, in prison. Mulligan continued to pick up intelligence after his release. He discovered that the British planned to ambush Washington while he was on his way to a meeting with Rochambeau on March 5, 1781. Because Mulligan and Cato both remained under suspicion of spying by the British, they could no longer safely communicate directly with Washington's headquarters. He gave the information to Townsend, who sent it to Washington via the Culper Ring route. It arrived in time for Washington to avoid the trap and travel to the meeting by another route. Because no correspondence with Mulligan's name or a recognized alias on it survives, a complete record of his, and Cato's, activities during the American Revolution can not be compiled.  Aftermath  Mulligan was cleared of suspicions that he might have had Loyalist sympathies in dramatic fashion when George Washington had breakfast with him on the day after the British evacuated the city and Washington entered it at the end of the war.Chernow, Ron. Alexander Hamilton. New York: Penguin Books, 2005. . Originally published New York, Penguin Press, 2004. p. 185. Although nothing definite has been found about Cato's life after the American Revolutionary War, it is known that on January 25, 1785, Mulligan became one of the 19 founding members, along with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, of the New York Manumission Society,Chernow, 2005, p. 214. an early American organization founded to promote abolition (or Manumission) of slavery.

Both were diplomats in the George W. Bush administration. The book is Whiton's attempt to articulate a realistic defense strategy for major contemporary threats to U.S. national security, with an emphasis on using smart power, which he defines as \\"the neglected tools of statecraft that lie between diplomacy and outright war.\\" Whiton includes personal accounts from the Bush administration and critiques of foreign policy in the Obama administration to illustrate what he believes to be a lack of U.S. smart power acumen. Whiton also draws heavily from the Cold War and other points in history to illustrate successful smart power. He adapts these tools to current threats, which he argues are primarily composed of Iran, China, and Islamism. Whiton also addresses the politics of national security, critiquing prominent figures on both the political left and the right. One reviewer summarized, \\"He defines the essence of 'smart power' as 'peacefully shaping political outcomes in foreign countries,' a skill no recent presidency has mastered.\\" Reviews Lewis Lehrman, a Reagan administration official, favorably reviewed Smart Power, writing, \\"This book should be read by every unselfconscious, unapologetic patriot, whether conservative or liberal. Libertarians, too, will find the analysis useful to their purposes. And it should be on the reading list of every potential candidate who aspires to replace the incumbent president.\\" However, Lehrman criticized \\"Whiton's derisive treatment of Ron Paul.\\" Writing for the Claremont Review of Books, John R. Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, questioned Whiton's focus on reform of the national security apparatus: \\"Readers can agree or disagree with Christian Whiton's recommendations for reform. My own view is that the problems are more cultural than structural, and that something more than a simple rearrangement of the bureaucracy is required.\\" However, Bolton wrote favorably that, \\"His policy critiques are worthwhile, but what really shines is his version of Gulliver's Travels through the national security bureaucracy. His journey is of course unique, but it reflects larger patterns and failures within the State Department and beyond.\\" Elliott Abrams, who was a deputy national security advisor in the George W. Bush administration, was critical of what he called Whiton's \\"habit of attacking potential allies‚Äîfor example, neoconservatives‚Äîand Whiton writes of 'neoconservatives on the right and moralists on the left [who] call for intervention at the drop of a hat' and 'whose sole solution to foreign problems so often seems to be sideshow wars.'\\" However, Abrams also wrote that \\"it is not Whiton's specific proposals that make this a valuable book; it is his analyses of today's foreign policy challenges and our bureaucratic failings in meeting them. His portrait of the Foreign Service is etched in acid, and his description of the jumble of agencies and offices supposedly handling political warfare when they oppose even the idea that we should engage in this type of combat is effective and therefore depressing. But he seems a happy warrior himself, confident that the next Harry Truman or Ronald Reagan is out there and that \\"American voters will find them eventually.'\\" In the Huffington Post, James Farwell summarized, \\"Whiton is a member of what I call the hard-nosed school of realism. He advocates the use of kinetic means if essential, but mostly he favors a tough- minded approach that challenges those who oppose the U.S. through savvy peaceful means that achieve well-defined political objectives -- what the military thinks of as 'end-states'‚Äîwhile avoiding unnecessary bloodshed.\\" However, Farwell disagreed with some of Whiton's conclusions, including over non-intervention in Rwanda to stop genocide in the mid-1990s.

Stone (February 19, 1869 ‚Äì December 9, 1959) was a President of Colt's Manufacturing Company who saw the company through the build-up to World War I and the end of World War II. Early life Stone was born in Urbana, Ohio in 1869 where he attended public schools. In 1890 he left Ohio for St. Louis to work as a buyer for Simmons Hardware Company. He worked at Simmons for 15 years, eventually leaving to accept a position at Colt Firearms. Colt's Samuel M. Stone started with Colt's Manufacturing Company in 1905 as a salesman. He was elected to company vice-president in 1916, and eventually President of Colt's from 1921 to 1944. Anticipating a military draw-down following World War I, Stone and company president William C. Skinner implemented a diversification program at Colt's Manufacturing similar to that done at the close of the American Civil War. Skinner and Stone acquired contracts for business machines, calculators, dishwashers, motorcycles, and automobiles; all marketed under a name other than Colt. Other measures included cutting the work week, reducing salaries, and keeping more employees on the payroll than they needed, all of which kept the company in business. Striking workers from the plant firebombed Stone's house in an act of terrorism in 1934. Later that year, Stone was summoned to testify before the Nye Committee to address allegations that Colt (among many other companies also under investigation) had improperly campaigned for America to enter World War I, in order to increase arms sales to the U.S. government. Company records orived that this was incorrect, disclosing that Stone (and Colt as a whole) had been concentrating on selling pistols to markets in Latin America and Asia instead. In 1944 Colt faced labor and cash flow problems once again, as the demands of wartime production had required their workforce to surge dramatically, from 1100 workers in 1936, to a peak of over 13,000. The Federal Government intervened to ensure war materiel production was not interrupted, and had Stone step down as president.

He was a leading figure in anthropology in his country from the late 1960s until his death. Biography =Education and early career= SƒÉhleanu was born in Gura Humorului, in the Bukovina region of the Kingdom of Romania. After finishing secondary school at the Aron Pumnul High School in CernƒÉu»õi, he entered the medical faculty of the University of Bucharest, from which he graduated in 1948. At that point, with the onset of the Communist regime, the institution became the Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy. Between 1944 and 1946, he took part-time courses at the literature and philosophy faculty as well, but did not earn a degree. In 1949, he became a doctor of medicine and surgery, with a thesis on \\"Considerations regarding Field Medicine\\". »òtefan-Marius Milcu presided over the doctoral committee, which also included Constantin Ion Parhon. He began working in hospitals while still a student, and during 1946, was a junior teaching assistant in the anatomical pathology department.Ciuhu»õa, p.9 After graduation in 1948, he won a competition to become an intern at the Parhon-led endocrinology institute, where he was also a researcher from 1954 to 1961. He worked in endocrinology for a total of seventeen years, during which he founded the institute's morphopathology laboratory. From 1950 to 1952, he was a peer reviewer at the Milcu-led anthropology collective, a section of the endocrinology institute that was essentially a continuation of the Francisc Rainer-founded anthropology institute. In 1954, he signed up for part-time classes at the physics and mathematics faculty in Bucharest, graduating in 1961. =Involvement in anthropology and legacy= In 1963, he became a primary care endocrinologist and, at the request of Eugen A. Pora, began teaching courses in biophysics and biomathematics at Babe»ô-Bolyai University in Cluj. In 1965, he earned the title of Doctor of Science. The same year, he was transferred from the endocrinology to the geriatrics institute. In 1969, he was transferred from Babe»ô-Bolyai and named adjunct scientific director at Bucharest's center for anthropological research; from that point until his death, he was at the forefront of anthropology in Romania. In 1974, when the center became a laboratory within the Victor Babe»ô institute, SƒÉhleanu became its director, serving for eight years. In 1982, due to the so-called \\"Transcendental Meditation Affair\\", he was excluded from scientific life. His works were withdrawn from libraries, his name could no longer appear in books or publications, and he was transferred to work as a doctor at a hospital in the Titan neighborhood. In 1984, aged 60, he retired upon his request. Between 1982 and 1984, he taught postgraduate courses in anthropology at a United Nations demographic center in Bucharest. As an anthropologist, he developed an interdisciplinary approach to the field that combined biology and culture, exploring the relationship between anatomical features and their behavioral, symbolic and cultural significance. In 1980, he was editor-in-chief of Romania's first atlas of biological anthropology. In February 1990, after the fall of the regime, he was restored as head of the Romanian Academy's anthropological research center, by government decree. He died in 1997, following complications from a cerebral hemorrhage.Ciuhu»õa, p.10 He and his wife Zoe, a pediatrician, had two sons: Adrian George, who became a philologist and psychoanalyst; and Valentin, later an architect.Kozma, p.34 SƒÉhleanu published over 2000 articles and 60 books, in fields that included methodology, medical psychology and psychoanalysis, ethics, aesthetics and the history of medicine and science. He kept a diary, from age 17 until his final days, that reached over 25,000 pages.Kozma, p.35 He was also an essayist and poet, publishing volumes in 1961, 1972, 1977 and 1997; and was among the founders of the Romanian Society of Writer and Journalist Physicians.Ciuhu»õa, p.12 Alexandru Ofrim stated that SƒÉhleanu wrote communist propaganda against erotic pleasure.

It is the third Carthusian monastery in the Americas and the second in Latin America. Foundation The idea of establishing a Charterhouse in Argentina emerged because those Argentinians who considered the Carthusian vocation had to emigrate to other countries. In 1997 the project was supported by the General Chapter of the Carthusian Order and by the Argentine Conference of Catholic Bishops. On that year, four Carthusian monks were sent from the Grand Chartreuse (the head monastery of the Carthusian Order) to Argentina to look for a suitable place for the new monastery. They found the ideal setting to establish the new Charterhouse in the ‚ÄúCampo de la Trinidad‚Äù, which is a secluded area near the city of De√°n Funes, C√≥rdoba. The Monastery The architect who designed this Charterhouse is Federico Shanahan. On October 15, 1998, a small part of the hermitage was inaugurated and, on March 19, 2004 (on St Joseph's Day), the whole building was completed and the church consecrated. The construction has 22 cells, several chapels, a refectory, a chapter house and a guesthouse. Nowadays, this monastery is inhabited by more than a dozen monks.

This is a list of bird species confirmed in the Canadian province of Quebec. Unless otherwise noted, the list is that of the Regroupement Qu√©becOiseaux (RQ) Checklist of the Birds of Quebec as of October 2019. The RQ Checklist contains 460 species. Of them, 150 are casual as defined below. Four species are extinct and six species were introduced to North America. The list does not include species of unknown or captive origin. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check- list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that Canadian English spellings are used and the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. French names in parentheses are from the RQ Checklist. The following tags are used to describe some categories of occurrence. * (C) Casual - species which neither breed in Quebec nor are regular migrants * (I) Introduced - introduced to North America by humans, but not necessarily directly introduced in Quebec Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

Life and career Lanza grew up playing piano and clarinet before going to Concordia University to study jazz. Before starting her career as a singer and music producer, she worked as a music teacher. Lanza was listed as one of the best new artists of 2013 by XLR8R. In a review of her debut album, Pull My Hair Back, she was described by The Guardian as \\"the latest and possibly greatest of the new ethereal soul girls\\" and ranked #4 on Resident Advisor's Top 20 Albums of 2013. Pull My Hair Back was co-written and co- produced with Jeremy Greenspan of Junior Boys and released on the UK's Hyperdub record label. The album Pull My Hair Back was a shortlisted nominee for the 2014 Polaris Music Prize.\\"Arcade Fire, Drake, Shad make Polaris Music Prize short list\\". CTV News, July 15, 2014. In 2014, Lanza collaborated with Caribou on his album Our Love. In 2015, she recorded vocals for The Galleria EP Calling Card / Mezzanine. The duo released a single in 2019 titled Stop & Go. Her second album Oh No was released in 2016, and was shortlisted again for the 2016 Polaris Music Prize. Her third album All the Time was released in July 2020. Influences Lanza possesses a soprano vocal range, similar to Elizabeth Fraser and Aaliyah. As a child, Lanza listened to Janet Jackson and Paula Abdul. The singer said that having a background in studying jazz helped her to have \\"the ability to hear and lift chord progressions\\", which led her to an understanding of R&B; music that permeates her recent work. Laced with funk, soul, R&B;, and haunting high-register vocals, Lanza cites Missy Elliott and Timbaland as early influences on her songwriting. The singer has also cited such artists as Evelyn \\"Champagne\\" King and Melba Moore. She also cited Japanese synthpop artists of the 1970s and 1980s, such as Yellow Magic Orchestra members Haruomi Hosono, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and Yukihiro Takahashi, as key influences. She has a postmodern approach to writing music, comparing her songs to a mashup of all the pop songs over the last 40 years that she likes.

She and her sister ship the Liberty were commissioned in 1987. They replaced two older vessels. Within a year both vessels developed serious corrosion problems, due to poor choice of alloys, and the joints between different metals. The Los Angeles Times reported that the vice president of Moss Point Marine, Vince Almerico, said \\"If the port wanted entirely rust-free vessels it could have specified use of stainless steel for everything at a much higher cost.\\" The vessels were 88 feet long, and their five water cannons were capable of pumping water or foam at 10,000 gallons per minute. The two vessels cost $2.2 million each, in 1987 dollars, and, by September 1988 the Long Beach Harbor Commission had to allocate an addition $883,000 to repair the construction problems. The Challenger and the Liberty were delivered in a red livery with black trim, while the two older fireboats they replaced were grey. The maintenance problems had such a serious effect on crew morale that the Los Angeles Times reported crew members had put up a sign, saying, the city should sell the red ones and keep the grey ones. The Challenger and the Liberty are scheduled to be replaced by more modern fireboats in 2014.

The city was founded atop a bluff on the Arkansas River. Thus, elevation protected most of the inhabitants and their possessions from damage when the river flooded. However, by the turn of the 20th Century the population growth had moved closer to the river, and the flatlands west of the Arkansas had begun to develop as well. The floods typically caused widespread property damage and sometimes death. By the 1920s, seasonal floods of the Arkansas began to cause serious damage and loss of life. Since its founding, city leaders had responded to such events by simply rebuilding and replacing the property that had been destroyed in situ. Not until 1970 did the city government begin developing strategies to mitigate floods or at least minimize property damage and prevent loss of life. This article describes some of the more notable floods in Tulsa, then the mitigation and control strategies that evolved from them. Floods continued to endanger life and property, as the city encroaches on the surrounding farm land. City authorities decided that then-existing Federal guidelines were inadequate to control the local situation and began to develop more stringent requirements. The Tulsa plan has evolved and now affects the entire watershed, including other communities in the Tulsa metropolitan area. Although floods cannot be totally prevented, the Tulsa flood control program has been recognized as a success by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and several other organizations. The control efforts will go on as long as people live in vulnerable areas. Major floods Flood records are sparse before 1900. In 1908, only a year after statehood, Arkansas River flooding at Tulsa caused $250,000 in damages ($6.45 million in 2019 dollars). The city was mostly on top of a bluff along the river, thus spared flooding. However, the railroad bridge across the river was washed away, disrupting railroad traffic westward until the bridge could be replaced.\\"Flood Control and Drainage.\\" City of Tulsa.

The flood included Tulsa's waterworks, which were located at what is now Newblock Park, The new waterworks, were built on higher ground northeast of downtown Tulsa, near Bird Creek. This area became Mohawk Park, one of the nation's largest city parks. The city also issued its first flood control plan, attempting to put housing on higher ground and reserving the lowlands for parks. =1943 flood= Another flood on the Arkansas River threatened the oil refineries in West Tulsa in 1943. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) immediately built levees around the refineries, which were considered vital for the U. S. military in World War II (WWII). A provision in the Lower Mississippi Flood Control Act of 1928 had authorized the USACE to construct dams and levees as needed to control flooding. Even so, the flood killed 21 people, injured 26 and left about 4,000 homeless. Though monetary damages have not surfaced, 413 houses were destroyed and 3,800 were damaged.Flanagan, p. III-1.

In 1966, Tulsa annexed the Mingo Creek watershed. The Mother's Day flood of 1970 in Tulsa caused $163,000 in damages ($1.07 million in 2019 dollars) to the rapidly developing areas along Mingo and Joe creeks in the eastern part of the city. Still, recovery consisted of repairing or replacing flooded structures in their original locations. =1974 floods= Three floods occurred in April and May, 1974. Damages were estimated at $744,000 ($3.86 million in 2019 dollars) along Bird Creek. In June, floods occurred along Fry, Haikey, Joe and Mingo Creeks. This time damages were estimated at over $18 million ($93.30 million in 2019 dollars). Mingo Creek flooded again on September 19, 1974. =1976 flood= The 1976 Memorial Day flood marked a milestone in Tulsa's search for flood solutions. A three-hour, 10-inch deluge occurred over the headwaters of Mingo, Joe and Haikey creeks. The resulting flood killed three people and caused $40 million in damages ($179.65 million in 2019 dollars) to more than 3,000 buildings. =1984 flood= A cold front that stalled over the Tulsa area on May 26‚Äì27, 1984 dropped between 6 and 15 inches (15 and 38 cm) of rain, flooding several parts of the city. The floods killed 14 people and caused $180 million ($442.72 million in 2019 dollars) worth of property damage.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) needed to open the flood gates and release as much as 300,000 cfs of water into the Arkansas River. That rate would cause record flooding along the river from Keystone to Muskogee. Many people living near the river in Tulsa voluntarily evacuated.

The water ran down streams and into Keystone Lake. In response, the US Army Corps of Engineers began to release water from the Keystone Dam into the Arkansas River. In preparation for another wave of storms, the US Army Corps cut back on how much water was being released into the river, hoping to allow its waters to recede enough to handle additional rain. The second wave of severe thunderstorms dropped record-breaking amounts of rain and spawned numerous tornadoes. This additional rain also cascaded into Keystone Lake, among others, and the Army Corp was forced to open the gates further. The following day, as water continued to fill the lake, the Army Corp struggled to balance the water entering and leaving the lake. However, they had no choice but to continue to lift the gates higher or risk the water levels overtaking the dam.https://www.newson6.com/story/40520494/city-of-tulsa-addresses- flooding-and-evacuations The resulting flow downstream began to threaten neighborhoods and cities.

On the morning of May 23, the Keystone flood gates continued to be lifted as the Flood Pool reached 100% capacity, increasing the flow to 221,000 cfs with plans to raise that to 250,000 cfs by noon. The National Weather Service in Tulsa increased the forecast level of the Arkansas River from 21 feet to 23 feet, putting the river in major flood stage and only 2 feet shy of levels reached in October 1986.https://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/watch-live-officials-discuss- ongoing-flooding-concerns-as-keystone- dam/article_b0e22907-37c1-545e-b04a-b25fc3f30c56.html Meanwhile, the barges broke free again shortly before 11AM, once again threatening the dam. Shortly before noon, the barges collided into the dam and sank. After an inspection of the dam, it was declared to have received minimal damage.

President Trump approved the disaster declaration the following day, ordering Federal assistance to supplement State, tribal, and local responses.https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j- trump-approves-oklahoma-emergency-declaration/ The Army Corps planned to continue releasing at 250,000 cfs through Sunday, May 26. After additional thunderstorms during the night of May 24‚Äì25, the Corps changed their plans to continue at this pace until Wednesday, May 29 and suggested additional precipitation could lead to another extension. Mayor Bynum also urged citizens protected by levees to begin making voluntary plans for evacuation. He stated that, even though the levees were currently doing their job, they had never been tested to this extent. Additional storms during the night of May 25‚Äì26 prompted the Corps to extend their release schedule yet another day to May 30. They also increased the rate of release into the Arkansas initially to 265,000 cfs and then raising it to 275,000 the next morning.https://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/keystone-dam-release-to-increase- again-this-morning%3f_amp=true In the early hours of Memorial Day, yet another round of severe storms dropped precipitation along the upper Arkansas River Basin in northwestern and north central Oklahoma as well as south central Kansas. On May 28, the lake finally overcame a major hurdle and began to recede. Predicted storms had gone south of the dam, allowing for the lake waters to stabilize. The following day, even as another round of storms was going through Tulsa, the Army Corps announced they would begin cutting back the releases at the dam. At 4pm, the flow was reduced to 265,000 cfs followed by a 10,000 cfs reduction every 6 hours. Their goal was to reduce the rate to 150,000 cfs by Saturday and 100,000 cfs early the following week.https://ktul.com/news/local/keystone-release-could-be-dropping-as- resilient-community-fights-back-flood-water Meanwhile, the storms over Tulsa had increased the height of the river by 6 inches, but again had not greatly impacted Keystone Lake. However, the river quickly receded below the height of the previous day. Mitigation and protection Tulsa's government responded to the 1970 flood by joining the \\"emergency program\\" of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and promising to adopt federal floodplain regulations. In August 1971, NFIP issued its block rate maps. A month later, on Labor Day, Flat Rock, Bird and Haikey creeks flooded, affecting many suburban communities. In December, Bird Creek flooded again. Tulsa then joined the NFIP's \\"regular\\" program, adopted a new 100-year flood standard, and promised to regulate floodplain land use. After the three floods in 1974, the victims demanded more action by the city, which they claimed was not enforcing the NFIP regulations. They tried to halt development, to avoid more flood damage until existing problems could be solved. Developers strongly objected, starting a debate over floodplain management, called \\"Tulsa's great drainage war\\" by the local media, which lasted for several years. The city came up to meet the managers' with a plan to widen part of Mingo Creek. One part of the plan included removing damaged structures. Thirty three houses in the right of way were removed just before the next flood. The 1984 flood demonstrated that emergency managers could not receive accurate data quickly enough about the progress of flooding. This was true throughout the state, as well as in Tulsa. Information from airport radars, updated hourly, was inadequate to meet the managers' needs. The University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University collaborated with the Climatological Survey and other public and private agencies to create the Oklahoma Mesonet. This system collects weather information (e.g., wind speed, rainfall, temperature) every 5 minutes from 120 Mesonet stations throughout Oklahoma. Emergency planners can now monitor up- to-date weather information in advance of the arrival of an approaching storm. The article quoted an official of the Tulsa Area Emergency Management as saying that his staff uses the Oklahoma Mesonet every day.Peterson, Althea. \\"Oklahoma Mesonet had roots in the 1984 Memorial weekend flooding.\\" Tulsa World. May 27, 2014. Retrieved June 19, 2014. in 1985, Tulsa centralized responsibility for all city flood, drainage, and stormwater programs in a Department of Stormwater Management . A stormwater utility fee was established by ordinance in 1986 to operate the program. Owners of all properties in the city are required to pay the fee, which was established by an ordinance at $2.58 per month. Business property is taxed at $2.58 per month for each of impervious surface. The ordinance allotted the entire fee exclusively for floodplain and stormwater management activities, and ensured stable funding for maintenance and management. Tulsa's flood protection plan has three objectives: prevent new problems; correct existing problems; improve safety, environment and quality of life. The city officials believed that the standards set by the NFIP were inadequate, based on Tulsa's previous experience. Tulsa requires that floodplains be defined based on anticipated future development, rather than on development conditions at the time. NFIP also requires that the lowest level of structures within the floodplain be at or above the elevation of the existing 100 year flood. Tulsa requires and enforces an additional one-foot (30.5 cm) of freeboard above flood elevation. Before a property that lies within the floodplain can be altered, the owner must obtain a watershed development permit. Recognition of progress In the early 1990s, FEMA ranked Tulsa first in the nation for its floodplain management program. allowing Tulsans to enjoy the nation's lowest flood insurance rates. The program was also honored with FEMA's 1992 Outstanding Public Service Award; and the Association of State Floodplain Managers has twice given Tulsa its Local Award for Excellence. FEMA increased Tulsa's community rating from Class 5 to Class 3, making Tulsans eligible for a 35 percent discount on flood insurance premiums. The previous Class 5 rating had provided a 25 percent discount. The ratings are periodically adjusted to reflect a community's reduced risk through its efforts to improve \\"...public information, mapping and regulations, flood preparedness and flood damage reduction. The discounts are in five percent increments from Class 9 (five percent) to Class 1 (45 percent).\\" As of 2000, Tulsa was the only U.S. community rated as Class 3.FEMA news release. \\"FEMA Honors Tulsa, Oklahoma As Nation's Leading Floodplain Management Community.\\" September 13, 2000.

Charlotte is eventually released from Welby after the Liars (minus Aria) lie under oath and testify in favor of her release as a favor to Alison. However, Charlotte is murdered by an unknown assailant merely hours after leaving Welby. Her death fueled the rise of a new \\"A\\", using the alias A.D., who was severely adamant on avenging Charlotte's homicide. During the sixth- season finale \\"Hush, Hush, Sweet Liars\\", the Liars discover that Jessica DiLaurentis has an identical twin sister, Mary Drake, a former patient at Radley Sanitarium who is Charlotte's biological mother. In \\"The DArkest Knight\\", Mary is revealed to be Spencer Hastings' biological mother, thus making her Charlotte's maternal half-sister. During \\"Farewell, My Lovely\\", Mona confesses to killing Charlotte after finding out that her mental health hadn't improved and her intentions were to harm the Liars again. In \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\", the elusive A.D. is revealed to be Alex Drake, Spencer's identical twin sister. Alex believed the Liars knew who orchestrated Charlotte's murder and was also set on physically replacing Spencer due to envying the upbringing she was able to have.  Casting and development  Vanessa Ray, the actress who played Drake throughout the series' run It was reported that Vanessa Ray was cast to portray CeCe Drake, who was later known to be Charlotte DiLaurentis. When Ray was announced to start filming again for Pretty Little Liars fourth season, she spoke about returning, stating: \\"It's so fun to do, and what a crazy character I get to play. She's sort of a sociopath. I think she's so weird because she's, like, 22 but hangs out with high-schoolers. It's like, 'Hey, girl! Get a life!'\\" Drake was characterized as a \\"beyond-charismatic twenty-something blonde stylist at a boutique that has one heel in the present, one in the past.\\" Pretty Little Liars executive producer Oliver Goldstick stated that Drake acted as a mentor to Alison DiLaurentis, teaching her \\"the wicked ways of the world.\\" Drake's is described as having a sociopathic personality: controlling, charming, seductive, dominant, and extremely intelligent.

CeCe spent what was described as an \\"intense\\" summer with Alison DiLaurentis in Cape May, New Jersey, prior to her disappearance. She previously dated Jason DiLaurentis and broke up with him the day after Alison went missing. Jason blames CeCe for the way Ali acted. When Emily and Nate are looking for something he wanted to purchase Jenna Marshall for her birthday, CeCe could tell Emily disfavored his interest on Jenna and assumed she had feelings for Nate. Thus, she steals Jenna's contact from Emily's cell phone, and prank dials Marshall to state she was Nate's girlfriend, and wanted Jenna to back off. Emily is frightened, but CeCe deduces she's grateful.

CeCe tells her she's trying to spread the word about a fashion show. Once they catch a glimpse of Paige and Emily arriving to school, CeCe reveals to Spencer that her and Paige had a feud between the two over Emily Fields in which CeCe referred to Paige as \\"Pig Skin\\". In a flashback, CeCe and Alison talk in her car, and Alison tells her about how she'd set up Paige by writing her a love letter, pretending to be Emily. CeCe says she's proud of her. When Paige appears for the setup, Alison confronts her and threatens to tell her father, who is the deacon at the church. Paige screams at Alison to give her the note back, but Alison says that she owns her now. CeCe gleefully speeds away from the scene with Alison. CeCe proceeds to admit that she believed Alison was afraid of Paige. Later, Spencer helps her out at the boutique and CeCe saves her from a snake attack in one of the dressing rooms. At the end of the episode, Big A plays on the jukebox as she hands over a key to another black-gloved A. In \\"Out of the Frying Pan, Into the Inferno\\", CeCe remembers the photo of Ali and Cece bonding with lobsters in Cape May, NJ that Emily shows her, but she confesses to never really knowing who \\"beach hottie\\" was.

She winds up calling Aria, to ask if she could help with the photos, since the first photographer she hired was unprofessional. CeCe later leaves Aria and Wesley alone to go get some dinner and never returns. She calls to tell them her car got towed, but she is lying because she is sitting in her car while making that phone call. Only minutes prior, Jason and Emily were involved in an elevator accident - an act of deliberate sabotage. In this same episode, Jason relays a flashback to Emily of the night Ali disappeared. He recalled seeing 'Alison' arguing with Melissa near his house, but when he called her name, it was CeCe who turned her head around. At the end of the episode, two 'A's play \\"spin the bottle\\" with pictures of the Liars on whiskey bottles. The flask ends up pointing on Aria, but Big A turns it to Spencer and then, both of them drink the whiskey. During \\"Hot Water\\", Hanna sees Wilden arrest CeCe in his police vehicle. CeCe later leaves Rosewood because Wilden believes she told people about him possibly getting Alison pregnant. As she's packing her bags, Emily quickly stops by her apartment in order to find out who took the picture of her and Alison at Wilden's boat. CeCe admits that it was Melissa and once Emily confronts her about Jason's memory of seeing Melissa talking to her at the DiLaurentis' backyard the night Alison went missing, she later reveals that Melissa was looking for the N.A.T. Club's footage. At the end of the episode, Big A cuts up pink roses, and puts them in a lowery wreath with a ribbon which says \\"With Deepest Sympathy\\", foreshadowing Toby's faux death.

During \\"I'm Your Puppet\\", it was revealed that CeCe had a visitor pass to Radley signed by Wren and that she was secretly visiting Mona while she was admitted at the institution. According to Wren, he got into a lot of trouble for allowing her a pass at a time when Mona wasn't supposed to have visitors. But he let CeCe see Mona because she was desperate to see her since she stated to have been \\"traumatized by Alison\\" and wanted to act as a mentor for Mona. Apparently, it was Melissa who called CeCe to tell her that Mona was in Radley. The reasons as to why she did so are still unspecified. Mona would later admit to seeing CeCe while in Radley, though not recalling what they spoke about due to being on medication, in the episode \\"'A' is for A-l-i-v-e\\". = Season 4 = In \\"Turn of the Shoe\\", Big A feeds dinner to a caged Tippi as it continues to speak in Alison's voice. During \\"Cat's Cradle\\", A looks at Emily's x-ray of her shoulder. In \\"Face Time\\", Big A holds a broken mask of Melissa as she glues the broken pieces together.

In \\"Into the Deep\\", Paige throws Emily a surprise birthday party at her aunt's lake house. While Aria and Emily are looking for Spencer outside, Emily spots a body floating face down in the lake. She rushes in panic and turns the body over to see that it's Jenna. Emily thinks whoever bashed her in the back of her head did it to make sure she didn't tell the Liars whatever information she withhold about Alison. Shana Fring later admits to Spencer at the hospital the person Jenna was afraid of was CeCe. At the end of the episode, Big A is seen playing the piano. She places a sheet of music in an envelope with the name \\"Toby Cavanaugh\\" written on it, whilst drinking wine. After Caleb finds CeCe's address from an old cable bill in \\"The Mirror Has Three Faces\\", Aria heads there and talks to CeCe's old roommate. She reveals that Alison got CeCe kicked out of college after she pushed a girl down a flight of stairs at a frat party in \\"The Badass Seed\\". However, Alison later reveals in the seventh-season episode \\"Exes and OMGs\\" that Noel was actually responsible for this incident and later used this information to blackmail him. Jessica DiLaurentis is also featured in the episode. In it, she has a flashback of a time when she received a phone call from Radley Sanitarium saying that Alison had checked in. When she got there she encountered CeCe dressed as Ali. Jessica described their friendship to Spencer and Hanna as obsessive and toxic, stating that \\"they 'wore' each other's personalities\\". The girls realize that the \\"Alison\\" masks that Alison purchased weren't for them, she probably had them made for CeCe. At the end of episode, Big A throws Ashley's muddy shoe in the pile of Emily's collapsed house. CeCe makes her first official appearance in the fourth season during the episode \\"Bring Down the Hoe\\". She is seen in an apartment filled with pictures of Alison DiLaurentis and the Liars, dating all the way back from Halloween 2008. We also see that she has a red coat, hinting at the fact that CeCe potentially spied on the Liars at the hoedown they attended earlier. CeCe is then shown in a black hoodie spying on Aria Montgomery and Ezra Fitz. Later, 'A' makes voodoo dolls of the five Liars: Aria, Spencer, Hanna, Emily, and the newest one, Mona. She takes the knitting utensil and stabs the Mona doll. In \\"Now You See Me, Now You Don't\\", the Liars are convinced that CeCe did indeed murder Darren Wilden as a sketch of a blonde woman resembling her physical features is shown on the news. As the girls realize that there are in fact two Red Coats while saving Emily in Ravenswood, Spencer chases after one while Aria chases after the other. During a brief struggle in which her Alison mask is kicked off by Aria, CeCe is revealed to be one of the Red Coats, and is the evil one that had been working against the Liars. CeCe attempts to escape by grabbing onto a rope, only for it to snap. Aria tries to pull CeCe up as she pleads for Aria to help her, however she proves too heavy for Aria as her sleeve rips and she falls to the ground. As the Liars gather together they are unsure if CeCe is dead or not. While the Liars are contemplating calling the police, CeCe's hand is seen twitching, and when the Liars turn around she has seemingly disappeared. During \\"Who's In The Box\\", Big A is spotted opening a secret basement in Ezra Fitz's cabin. According to Travis in \\"Love ShAck, Baby\\", CeCe was last spotted in Maryland on the run from the authorities. It was also divulged that she made huge money deposits before Wilden died. Big A later hacks into a GPS System, hinting that she might be the one who messed with Emily's GPS car settings.

She confesses to knowing who murdered Bethany Young (the girl buried in Alison's grave) and that Alison is still alive. At the end of the episode, Jessica's dead body is dragged across the grass as Charlotte buries her on the Hastings' backyard. = Season 5 = In \\"Escape from New York\\", CeCe is taken away by officer Barry Maple to be sent to jail, however, at some point she knocks him unconscious, steals his cop car and heads off to New York where Alison and the Liars are. Drake finds Ali and asks for her help since Alison owed CeCe a favor for helping her out in Ravenswood. Alison offers her a plane ticket to France and she leaves the country, under the alias of Vivian Darkbloom. When Emily catches Alison, she divulges that CeCe was being paid by Ezra for information. Ali further claims to have asked her to dress up as Red Coat only to distract \\"Big A\\". However, it's revealed much later that, unbeknownst to Alison, CeCe was the person who stole the \\"A\\" game from Mona and donned the Red Coat disguise during some of her missions. Ali also reveals that Drake was accountable for Wilden's murder. Drake is absent for the following three episodes, seeing as she headed to France. \\"Big A\\" later makes a comeback in \\"Miss Me √ó 100\\". She blows up the Cavanaugh's house and is seen texting the Liars while moving her belongings into a new lair. During \\"The Silence of the E. Lamb\\", \\"Big A\\", opens up Ella's engagement party letter and takes a picture of the item before gluing it back together as if it were never open.

In \\"How the 'A' Stole Christmas\\", CeCe returns to Rosewood to comfort Ali on her first Christmas without Jessica. In order to remain unseen, Drake wears a white cloak and offers Alison a bottle of customized perfume before warning her the Liars were there and not \\"to say Merry Christmas\\", meaning she does not trust them. The two later escape the ball after Alison hands to Cindy and Mindy their clothes as well as \\"Alison\\" masks and blonde wigs to trick the Liars. At the end of the episode, \\"Big A\\" lights up a Christmas tree outside Spencer's house with the message \\"Merry Christmas, Bitches - A\\". During \\"Over a Barrel\\", \\"Big A\\" sneaks into Holbrook's office and hacks into the Rosewood PD site on her computer. In \\"The Bin of Sin\\", \\"Big A\\" shines UV light on the door which leads to an ice cream factory containing Mona's clothes, looking for the Liars' fingerprints.

In \\"I'm a Good Girl, I Am\\", Charlotte plays with the Liars' dolls (minus Alison's) in a vehicle that escorts them to prison. After that, she prepares her tuxedo for the demented prom, foreshadowing the torturous events of \\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\\". = Season 6 = During \\"Don't Look Now\\", \\"Big A\\" is seen seated in front of a computer looking at the location of the Liars, revealing she placed trackers in them. In \\"She's No Angel\\", \\"Big A\\" creates a doll-sized wig of Aria's hairstyle with pink highlights.

In \\"FrAmed\\", \\"Big A\\" is monotoring footage from Rosewood's Art Gallery when her ally, costumed as Red Coat, arrives at their lair. At the end of the episode, \\"Big A\\" places six syringes in the trunk of her car, while Red Coat hands her an envelope from the driver's seat. The item contains two tickets to Rosewood High's prom. During \\"Last Dance\\", \\"Big A\\" abducts Alison at her high school prom and takes her backstage to unmask herself. In the mid-season finale of the sixth season \\"Game Over, Charles\\", CeCe is revealed to be the mysterious antagonist that has tormented the Liars throughout their senior year. At the ending of the previous episode, CeCe (then unknown) abducts Alison and takes her to Radley Sanitarium, where she recounts her story to Ali. Meanwhile, the Liars assist through a live feed in a vault at the Carissimi Group. Drake reveals to have been born as a boy named Charles DiLaurentis, and when he was 7 years old, he gave Alison a bath, but accidentally dropped her in the scalding hot water. Ali was saved by Kenneth, but as a consequence Charles was admitted to Radley. According to CeCe, as a child she frequently asked her mother to purchase her dresses but Kenneth despised his son for being feminine, so he used the bathtub incident as an excuse to send him away. Despite feeling lonely while residing at Radley, Jessica paid a visit to Charles as often as she could, in an attempt to make him feel less alienated. When Charles was 12 years old, Bethany Young pushed Toby's mother Marion Cavanaugh off the roof of Radley, presumably to protect his femininity. However, Bethany double-crossed Charles and blamed him for Marion's homicide. The staff at Radley believed her accusations due to the fact that Charles was wearing a dress at the time and didn't want to be seen in it. Jessica paid off a young Officer Wilden to make sure Mrs. Cavanaugh's death was ruled a suicide. Charles was diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder (IED), though this was actually an accurate diagnosis for Bethany. For the subsequent 2 years he was heavily medicated with tranquilizers, but was let out to attend his symbolic fake funeral. After the funeral took place at Carol Ward's house, Jessica finally embraced Charles as her daughter. She allowed his return to Radley as a female, renamed Charlotte. Charlotte dedicated herself to math as a way to escape reality, which allowed her to attend classes at the University of Pennsylvania. She thought going to school would be fun but it was easy for her since she already knew what she was being taught. One day, she called in a bomb threat to cancel classes. She used the opportunity to go to Rosewood High for yearbook picture day where she met Jason. She briefly dated him under the CeCe Drake alias, in order to get closer to her family. Jessica didn't know that CeCe Drake and Charlotte were the same person until the day the DiLaurentis were leaving for Cape May. Though initially angered at her children's incestuous relationship, Jessica allows Charlotte to go on vacation with the rest of the family. In Cape May, Charlotte became close friends with Alison and even planned on telling her they were related. However, Bethany found out about Mrs. D's affair with her father, thus ruining Charlotte's opportunity to tell her sister the truth. On Labor Day Weekend, the night of Alison's disappearance, Bethany stole Charlotte's clothes and snuck out of Radley to hurt Jessica at the DiLaurentis property. Charlotte broke out as well, in order to prevent Young from harming her mother. She stumbled upon a blonde in the front yard and bashes her in the skull with a rock. Charlotte immediately realizes that she actually hit Alison, not Bethany. Jessica buried Ali out of panic and paid Wilden to take Charlotte back to Radley. The medical staff at Radley took away Charlotte's out privileges but once Mona was admitted to the sanitarium, she took advantage of her drugged up state and manipulated her into telling everything she had done as \\"A\\". After Charlotte permanently got out of Radley, she moved into Rosewood, where she purposely met the Liars, and began hating the girls due to their relief over Alison's disappearance. Charlotte kept seeing a blonde girl in a red coat that resembled Ali, so she sent Sara Harvey to dress up as Red Coat and act as a decoy in the night of the lodge incident at Thornhill. Melissa also secretly ordered Shana and Jenna to keep tabs on the Liars, since she too had her own suspicions that Ali was alive. Charlotte's intentions were to lure Alison out of hiding, but things took a left turn when Shana set fire to the lodge. Nonetheless, Aria, Emily and Spencer were rescued by Sara and Alison arrived just in time to save Hanna, therefore giving Charlotte the much needed confirmation that her sister was alive. She killed Wilden to protect Alison since he would have never allowed her to return to Rosewood, and sent Sara to his funeral disguised as the Black Widow to ensure he was deceased. Before Charlotte fled to New York, she snuck home to say goodbye to her mother, only to find her lifeless body laying on the DiLaurentis' backyard. Following her mother's passing, she saw the events in New York as the perfect opportunity to end the \\"A\\" game and begin a new life in Paris, but eventually came back due to her addiction to power. Sara, dressed as Red Coat, sets a bomb to detonate inside of Radley as part of Charlotte's final plan to kill her family along with herself. The Liars managed to prevent any collateral damage from happening, since Spencer disabled the bomb while Emily punched Sara for betraying her. Charlotte then runs towards the roof and attempts to commit suicide. However, the Liars arrive in time to persuade her not to and Charlotte instead declares the ending to her reign as \\"A\\". In the following episode \\"Of Late I Think of Rosewood\\", it is revealed that Charlotte spent the subsequent five years under medical care at the Welby State Psychiatric Hospital. Despite the Liars' hesitation to testify in favor of Charlotte's release from the hospital, the girls, aside from Aria, ended up lying for Alison and stated that they were no longer traumatized by the events her older sister had put them through. The court approved Charlotte's release, however, it is revealed that Mona confronted her that night and that Charlotte intended on hurting the Liars to which they got in a fight and Charlotte got thrown against a metal staple that killed her and soon thrown off by Mona, soon being found dead the following day after allegedly committing suicide. After the funeral, the Liars were advised to stay in Rosewood, since the authorities ruled the events of Charlotte's death a homicide and they would be possibly held in for questioning. A mysterious entity observes the Liars in a car before it drives off. During \\"Charlotte's Web\\", Spencer finds out that Charlotte was killed in a copycat manner off a murder she wrote an essay about in college. The Liars later suspect Aria of being accountable for Charlotte's death after security footage at The Radley reveals that Ezra met up with her at the hotel and both left during the time her former tormentor was killed. When confronted by her friends, Aria decides to come clean about that night and reveals she couldn't sleep so she wanted to talk to Ezra and the two went for a walk around town. Around the time she departed with Ezra, both witnessed whom it appeared to be Charlotte entering the church moments before being murdered. At the end of the episode, an unidentified individual places flowers on Charlotte's fresh grave next to Jessica DiLaurentis', prior to walking over to a black car. Before stepping inside, their chauffeur states, \\"I‚Äôm sorry for your loss.\\" In \\"The Gloves Are On\\", Ezra refuses to talk about his whereabouts the night Charlotte was murdered and the Liars begin receiving text messages from their newest tormentor. At the end of the episode, an unseen person is holding a pair of Charlotte's signature black hoodies and gloves and dumps them into a garbage bin before searching for \\"UNIFORMS\\" on Google. When the murder weapon is revealed to be a nine iron in \\"New Guys, New Lies\\", Aria, with Emily's assistance, tries to find out if Ezra is guilty. Unable to get into Ezra's loft as he is out of town, Aria breaks in. In the loft, she witnesses that Ezra's nine iron isn't missing, but then overhears a voicemail coming in from her dad and worries that Byron might have had something to do with Charlotte's death. Later, Aria checks Byron's car to see his golf clubs and its nine iron is missing. After breaking into Sara Harvey's hotel room in \\"Do Not Disturb\\", and finding out that she's staying in what used to be Charlotte's former room at Radley, Aria and Spencer continue their investigation process in \\"Where Somebody Waits For Me\\". They discover a hole in the wall with a ladder leading down to a mysterious alley. There, they stumble upon an electric switchboard, presuming it was used upon Charlotte when she was admitted to Radley. They also uncover a secret passage that leads to somewhere out the back of the hotel which they suspect is how Sara has been getting in and out of the hotel unseen, fueling the possibility that she's avenging her former employer's death. Detective Tanner later divulges to the Liars that someone dialed Charlotte from the Two Crows diner the night she passed away. At the end of the episode, Spencer discovers that Melissa's broken suitcase handle matches the description of the alleged murder weapon. Throughout \\"We've All Got Baggage\\", Hanna further fuels the possibility that Melissa could have killed Charlotte by telling Spencer and Caleb how she ran into her at a fashion show in London, years prior to Charlotte's murder. A flashback reveals that Melissa spent the entire night drinking and sobbing at a bathroom in order to get over the fact that Charlotte dialed Wren to inform him that his partner had buried Bethany Young. Due to the side-effects of alcohol, Melissa proceeded to grab Hanna's phone and dial Welby to have a word with Charlotte by pretending to be Alison. Hanna got into a fight with Melissa and eventually threw the phone at a mirror to prevent hearing Charlotte's voice from the other end. Emily visits the Two Crows diner and discovers the missing part from Melissa's suitcase, but is nearly run over by a car that steals the weapon. In \\"Burn This\\", Emily stumbles upon an auto shop that appears to be fixing the same car that almost ran her over. After asking if anyone had brought in a dark gray SUV, one of the mechanic insists they can't help her. Emily comes backs to snoop around and lifts up a tarp covering a car. She sees paint and takes a picture of it before the same mechanic she had confronted earlier demands to know why she was there again. Emily tells him the car she was talking about matches the one she was investigating and asks if he knows who drove it last night. He says \\"Maybe I lent it to a friend. I can't remember\\". Emily holds up a picture of Melissa and asks if she was his friend. The mechanic denies, before looking back at the other guys and ordering Emily to leave. Later, Emily spots a pink dice keychain on Mona's keys as she's walking over to her car after leaving Hanna's engagement party. The object happens to fit the description of whomever called Charlotte the night she was killed. After being confronted by Emily, Mona states she can't talk about that subject outdoors. At the end of the episode, we see the mechanic that interacted with Emily wiping paint off the SUV, before reaching into the car and finding an enveloping containing several hundred dollars and smiling. During \\"Did You Miss Me?\\", Mona confesses to Emily that she called Charlotte from the Two Crows dinner in order to obtain answers and to find out if she was planning to use anything against her or the Liars since she didn't implicate them at all whilst hospitalized at Welby. Emily questions Mona whether or not she was responsible for Charlotte's homicide, but Mona states she didn't show up at the diner. Later during the episode, Emily and Spencer witness Sara Harvey's helper leaving the city hall with a document he hastily hands her as she suspiciously drives off. The girls decide to pursue Sara's driver and distract him in order to investigate his bags. In them, they stumble upon a tube that contains Radley's floor plan. Spencer then instructs Emily to continue following him so she can get a copy of the document at the town's city hall. In \\"Hush, Hush, Sweet Liars\\", Toby and Spencer study the replica map of Radley's floor plan and decide to head to the underground alley underneath Sara's hotel room to investigate it. Mona follows the two of them, and they stumble upon a floor containing an old Radley medical file belonging to Mary Drake. Mary was Jessica's identical twin sister who gave birth to Charles while she was still a patient at Radley Sanitarium. Since she wasn't stable enough to look after her child, Jessica and Kenneth fostered their nephew. At the end of the episode, it's revealed that Charlotte was in a secret relationship with Dr. Elliott Rollins, who was recruited by Mary to drive Alison insane so they'd gain full possession of the Carissimi Group's money. = Season 7 = In \\"Tick-Tock, Bitches\\", Elliott commences his physical torture towards Alison at Welby, believing she's held accountable for his former lover's murder. During \\"The Talented Mr. Rollins\\", the Liars discover a credit card statement charged for an Amish Bed & Breakfast on Elliott's dresser. After discovering it was the same week he went to his family's farm with Alison, Aria and Hanna drive there in hopes to fill out some blanks in regards to who Rollins truly is. Shortly after arriving at the small community, they meet a pre-teen girl called Eliza. She proceeds to show them dolls that Charlotte had offered her named and styled after each of the Liars. Eliza further divulges that their former tormentor used to visit the area very frequently with Elliott and had witnessed them exchanging a kiss. In a flashback during \\"Hit and Run, Run, Run\\", it's divulged that Alison was the blonde in the red sweater whom Ezra and Aria spotted the night of Charlotte's homicide. She followed her cousin to the church and up the bell tower, where the two argued over Ali's romantic involvement with Elliott. Charlotte heavily disapproved their relationship and accuses her cousin of merely visiting her in order to get closer to Rollins. Alison leaves the church moments before Charlotte is presumably murdered. At the end of the episode, Mona and Hanna listen to an incoming call from Jenna in Elliott's burner phone, which reveals his factual name as Archer. In another flashback during \\"Wanted: Dead or Alive\\", it's revealed that Charlotte enlisted Jenna's help to track down her birth mother's whereabouts and come up with an alias for her faux psychiatrist (revealed to be a wanted criminal in the previous episode). The pseudonym Elliott Rollins was later created so Archer could deliberately meet Alison and take advantage of her good intentions to benefit Charlotte's eventual release. During \\"Original G'A'ngsters\\", the Liars investigate the storm cellar over at Aunt Carol's house and discover that Jessica had turned it into her lair and kept files on all of them as well as Mary. While searching through Drake's medical history, they find out that she had a second child. The gender of Charlotte's biological sibling is undisclosed. In \\"The Wrath of Kahn\\", Spencer and Emily find a flash drive at The Kahn's cabin filled with footage from the time they were held captive in Charlotte's Dollhouse. After watching one of the videos, they discover that Noel Kahn was helping Charlotte torture them. During this episode, Aria and Jason team up to find out more details in regards to Mary's past and discover that Steven Kahn, Noel's father, orchestrated the adoption of Drake's second child. Near the ending of \\"The DArkest Knight\\", Jenna and Noel both attempt to murder the Liars, partly for their own reasons but to also avenge Charlotte, whom according to Kahn \\"taught them a lot\\". During the cat-and-mouse chase, Noel ends up stumbling upon an axe that decapitates his head and Marshall is knocked down by Mary Drake just as she was about to shoot Spencer Hastings. Once the Liars stumble upon Spencer being cradled on Mary's arms, they deduce she's accountable for their friend's critical condition. Mary swears she'd never harm Spencer as she tearfully claims to be her birth mother, thus revealing that Spencer is Charlotte's biological sister. During \\"These Boots Were Made for Stalking\\", Jenna walks into the police station in order to come clean about her actions and interrupts a conversation between Spencer and detective Marco Furey. Marshall reports that she kept a low profile after the events that took place at the abandoned school for blind students to avoid being harmed by Noel. According to Jenna, Kahn was accountable for Sara Harvey's homicide and she feared to be his ensuing victim. He recruited Jenna with the assertion that Charlotte left enough money in her will to afford Marshall another eye surgery. Nevertheless, Jenna suspected Noel of stealthily plotting to steal the cash all to himself since his parents had financially cut him off. In an attempt to spare her life, Marshall brought a gun to the deserted sight school as an act of self-defense and pretended to hold a grudge against the Liars. Later in the episode, Caleb threatens Marshall by warning her that the cops were uncovering inconsistencies in her allegations. However, Jenna assures him the police won't be able to prosecute her since Noel was the only person who could contradict her statement. In \\"Power Play\\", Hanna is hanging out at Spencer's house when she spots a P.I.‚Äôs business card from Peter‚Äôs briefcase. She convinces Spencer to infiltrate the investigation in order to locate Drake, and theorizes that Mary might be able to help point them in the direction of ‚ÄúA.D.\\". Afterwards, Hanna picks up the phone and calls the P.I., pretending to be someone from Peter's office. After getting help from the P.I., Hanna and Spencer knock on several doors until they approach one house and much to their surprise, Pastor Ted Wilson (Hanna's former step-dad) opens the door. The girls show Ted a picture of Drake and ask him if he has seen her, to which Wilson informs them that he hasn't. Hanna offers to grab coffee with Ted at the Radley later to catch up, and she also asks him to call her if he happens to spot Mary. As the Liars turn away to leave, Drake shows up in the doorway. Ted turns to Drake and questions her on what she's truly doing there. Later, he reaches out to Hanna to talk and they meet up at Lucas' loft, where Wilson reveals to have lied about Mary's visit. Ted further confesses that Drake is an ex-girlfriend of his back when he was a college student and that she met up with him to inform they had a child together. Things get even more intricate when Wilson discloses to Hanna that said offspring was Charlotte and that he met his daughter prior to her sex change. It turns out that Ted used to run a summer camp for troubled boys, and Charles was a camper there. Wilson is disheartened when describing that he interacted with a \\"soft-spoken, sweet\\" boy without awareness they were related. Ted then showcases Hanna a picture of himself back when he worked at the camp, chaperoning Charles and Lucas Gottesman, whom he described as his son's \\"only friend\\". This revelation leaves Hanna stunned. During \\"In the Eye Abides the Heart\\", the Liars are gathered at the Brew discussing Pastor Ted's mysterious photo of Charlotte and Lucas. Together, they wonder if Gottesman and Charlotte managed to stay in touch throughout the years. The girls decide to search Lucas's loft in an attempt to obtain answers, but Aria points out that the entire building could be bugged, considering his affinity for high- tech gadgets. Later, Emily and Hanna commence their search through Lucas's apartment. Hanna is quick to defend her friend, but while rummaging through a box of comic books, the two Liars come across a manila envelope tucked all the way in the back. Hanna reaches inside and pulls out another comic titled Arcturus. The author signatures at the bottom catches their eye, which reveal that it was conceived by Lucas and Charlotte. Aria soon joins Emily and Hanna, and they inspect the comic together. The content seems to be about a troubled boy who befriends a woman from outer space with magical powers. Together, they seek vengeance upon people who have hurt him. The girls can't help but notice that there are some eerily familiar drawings that resemble the electrical switches from Charlotte's Dollhouse. Almost immediately after this uncovering, Aria is seen on her phone, telling A.D. all about the comic through FaceTime. Back at the loft, Hanna pulls out the box where she previously found Lucas's mysterious comic, only to realize that it's missing. Aria is then seen bringing the comic to Rosewood High in the middle of the night. Her mission is to place the book in locker 214. Just as she starts to walk away after doing so, Aria appears to have a change of heart. She immediately doubles back to the locker, only to find a black hoodie hanging from the hook in its place. Near the end of the episode, Ezra spots Spencer at the airport with Wren Kingston. She immediately gets up and walks over to Ezra to quickly introduce him to her ex-boyfriend. Spencer then pulls Ezra off to the side and explains to him that she hasn't spoken to Kingston since before Charlotte's homicide. She met up with Wren in order to seek for enlightenment on his behalf about her half-sister given that he helped her sneak in and out of Radley. In \\"The Glove That Rocks the Cradle\\", Spencer steals a flash drive from Marco. The item contains footage of Lucas admitting to the authorities that he wasn't Hanna's alibi on the night of Charlotte's murder and that the other Liars are capable of homicide. Gottesman is then shown clutching the comic book that Aria handed to A.D. and later spotted by Hanna awaiting someone at The Radley. He is finally caught by all of the Liars when searching through the contents of his apartment and they confront him in an attempt to learn more about his connection to Charlotte. Lucas claims to have been unaware that Charles transitioned into a female and took inspiration upon the narrative of their book. A worrying Gottesman further divulges that he may have fed Charlotte all the information needed to torture the Liars since they stayed in touch through e-mail. During high school, Lucas disclosed to Charlotte that Alison bullied him and the other girls did nothing to prevent her out of loyalty. An anonymous individual proceeded to return the graphic novel to Gottesman, along with a note instructing him to meet them at The Radley or else his former friendship with Charlotte would be exposed. The person who gave him the ultimatum failed to show up, prompting Lucas to run back to his loft. As it turns out, Gottesman was concerned about a second graphic novel that had never been completed because it continued his first book's revenge storyline, only this time turning the events into a game. In the final moments of the episode, A.D. is seen flipping through pages of the missing novel and starts drawing the next chapter of the story, which includes a gravestone (presumably Charlotte's) nearby a tree. During \\"Farewell, My Lovely\\", Hanna noticed rose petals falling from the church's bell tower which prompts her to investigate. There she finds Mona dressed like she used to in high school. Hanna is puzzled over the fact that her friend keeps referring to her as Charlotte. Mona divulges she killed Charlotte and through flashbacks we see the two of them engaging in a heated confrontation. After realizing that her health condition hadn't improved after all and her intentions were to torture the Liars again through even worse approaches, Mona held a screwdriver to Charlotte's back. She taunted her former tormentor to jump or else she'd push her. Shortly after narrating a portion of the events, Mona suddenly grabs Hanna and attempts to throw her off the bell tower until Caleb and Spencer arrive just in time to prevent any collateral damage from happening. Mona is then taken to the Lost Woods and discloses to Spencer she messed up killing Charlotte. Asking what she meant by that, Spencer coaxed the full story from Vanderwaal who revealed that a fight broke out. Charlotte cruelly assured Mona the Liars would never love her back, causing Vanderwaal to gain the upper hand and shove her against a wall. A metal rod impaled Charlotte's cervical spine, which broke her neck and left a cut on the back of it. After realizing what she had done, Mona began to peel rose petals before throwing Charlotte's lifeless body from the bell tower to make it look like a suicide. In \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\", the elusive A.D. is revealed to be Alex Drake, Spencer's identical twin sister and Charlotte's maternal half-sister. She was born at Radley Sanitarium, the mental institution in which their mother had spent most her life in and out of. Prior to her birth was Spencer's, who was placed in the care of their biological father, along with his wife. Alex's existence was unbeknownst to the Hastings since she was born minutes after Spencer had already been given to Peter and Veronica. Mary, desperate to escape Radley, allowed Dr. Cochran to arrange Alex's adoption in exchange for $500,000 and a resignation from the psychiatric hospital. Alex was later adopted by a wealthy British couple. However, she began developing mental health problems at an early age, and the family that took her in refused to tarnish their name. This resulted in Alex being stripped off of her adoptive family and placed into an orphanage with her birth name. She then bounced around foster homes and orphanages for a large portion of her childhood. On her tenth birthday, Alex ran away from the Ambrose Home for wayward children and grew up leading a lonely life. As a teenager, she obtained a job bartending at a pub in London where she met Wren, who originally mistook her for Spencer. Kingston disclosed to Alex her blood relations to Spencer, Charlotte, and Mary. Alex was introduced to Charlotte prior to her death, when the latter flew from a transatlantic flight to France just to meet her. In a flashback, Charlotte is seen exiting a flight, talking to her future lover, Archer Dunhill. After promising to call Charlotte the next day he leaves and Charlotte gets a call from Wren, telling her that Alex is waiting for her in the airport. She says that she found twelve Alex Drake's and none were related to her. After Wren informs Charlotte that Alex looks a lot like someone they're acquainted with, she is stunned to stumble upon a girl heavily resembling Spencer before realizing she's her identical twin. According to Alex, the two bonded instantaneously and walked the streets of Paris until the sun came up, feeling like they'd known each other their whole lives. She goes on to clarify that Charlotte met Archer on the plane, and they initiated a romantic relationship. Spencer questions if Archer was on the A-Team as well, but Alex quickly dismisses her doubts by explaining that his severe mistreatments towards Alison at Welby was a stunt he pulled on his own. He persuaded Mary into assisting his scheme, believing that her niece was the mastermind who orchestrated Charlotte's murder. Wren and Alex eventually fell in love, and went on several double dates with Charlotte and Archer before she returned to Rosewood to continue the \\"A\\" game. During another flashback at a bar, Alex attempts to convince Charlotte to stay with her in London, thinking she allowed the Liars to have power over her. After she suggests departing with Charlotte to meet Spencer, she warns Alex to stay away from the Hastings as far as possible. Alex insinuates that Charlotte wants Spencer all to herself, prompting her to disprove Alex's hints of jealousy by stating that she only views Spencer as a \\"Doll\\". She insists on offering Charlotte a ride to the airport, but Charlotte declines, further justifying that a pre- meditated goodbye would be too hard to handle. The sisters share a final embrace and Charlotte gives Alex her favourite Patsy Cline's Greatest Hits record as a goodbye gift. Back in present time, Alex explains that Charlotte never returned to London, and the next time she saw her was when she first paid a visit to her grave. It is ultimately revealed that the person whom Ezra ran into at the airport with Wren before almost leaving for Maine was Alex. The couple was engaging in a heated argument over whether or not Alex's true intentions were justice for Charlotte's memory.  Reception  The character was initially well received by critics. Riley Sky of Dropkick Divas Media gave a positive review, saying, ‚Äúas charming and manipulative as Alison DiLaurentis was, we get to see where Ali got those sociopathic qualities in CeCe Drake. CeCe possesses a charm eerily similar to Alison‚Äôs. While Ali \\"may\\" be dead, CeCe gives us a refreshing look at how Ali's life would have looked. This beyond-charismatic twenty-something blonde stylist that sure does have one heel in the present, one in the past, CeCe leaves us wanting more.‚Äù The character's reveal as transgender and the show's second \\"A\\" was met with a polarizing reception. Some television critics described it as \\"harmful\\", \\"transphobic\\", and as \\"a negative stereotype about trans people.\\" One article stated that \\"a TV show adding a transgender character would be something to celebrate, since there is not nearly enough trans representation in media\\" but that the show \\"got it all wrong.\\" Several other reviewers were also concerned because \\"the twist played into a long history of pop culture linking sociopathic behavior with transgender individuals.\\" However, praise was given to Vanessa Ray's performance. Entertainment Weekly's Isabella Biedenharn called her ‚Äúfantastic‚Äù and ‚Äúcompelling.‚Äù The A.V. Club reviewer LaToya Ferguson wrote that the choice of having CeCe Drake being \\"A\\"/Charles was ‚Äúthe best decision‚Äù instead of choosing Wren. To her, it could have turned out worse, alluding to the Gossip Girl's reveal. Ferguson applauded Vanessa Ray's emotional performance, ‚Äúreminding the audience (and characters) why they were drawn to CeCe in the first place.‚Äù She highlighted how CeCe manages to make her wrongdoings acceptable, almost redeeming herself. For her portrayal in the show's sixth season, Ray won a Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Villain.

After the release of Waiting Rooms (a commercial failure with reviews which ranged from the ecstatic to the dismissive), Warner briefly worked as a string arranger for Sneaker Pimps and began work on a never-completed second album before quitting the industry and the public eye altogether (becoming a minor cult British pop figure in the process).

Cape Spartel (; ) is a promontory in Morocco about above sea level at the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar, 12 km West of Tangier. Below the cape are the Caves of Hercules. Description Caves of Hercules. Cape Spartel is frequently but incorrectly referred to as the northernmost point of Africa, which is instead Ras ben Sakka, Tunisia. It is the most North Western point of mainland Africa. The cape rises to a height of 326 m. at the top of Jebel Quebir where there is a tower. There is another tower nearer to the end of the cape which serves as a lighthouse.The Strait of Gibraltar, accessed November 2012 Below the cape are the Caves of Hercules. These are open to the public and they are accessible from Robinson Plage. The caves have shown evidence of neolithic occupation. Before they were a tourist attraction they were brothels. Historically the rock was mined and this is one important cause of the caves creation. Near Cape Spartel is Spartel Bank, a sunken island hypothesized by some as the location of the legendary island of Atlantis. Cape Spartel is accessible from the National Road S701. Historical events During the War of the Spanish Succession, two Spanish 60-gun ships - the Porta Coeli and Santa Teresa - were intercepted on 23 March 1704 by an English squadron under Vice-Admiral Thomas Dilkes off Cape Espartel, comprising the 70-gun ships Kent and Bedford and the 50-gun Antelope. The two Spanish warships, newly built at Orio, were laden with ordnance and military stores and were accompanied by a 24-gun merchantman, the San Nicolas. After a seven hours battle, both warships were captured; they were taken to Lisbon, but the Santa Teresa sank en route. Cape Spartel in 1732. During the American War of Independence on 20 October 1782 there was an inconclusive battle between British and French/Spanish fleets about 18 miles off the coast, the Battle of Cape Spartel between ships under Admiral Luis de C√≥rdova y C√≥rdova and a British fleet under Admiral Richard Howe. The battle was required to maintain British supplies to the besieged Rock of Gibraltar. In December 1911, the British P&O; liner, SS Delhi, ran aground near to Cape Spartel. All passengers were rescued by British and French warships, but three French rescuers were lost.http://www.poheritage.com The Battle of Cape Espartel was a naval battle on 29 September 1936 during the Spanish Civil War. The engagement took place between two Nationalist cruisers and two Republican destroyers, and broke the Republican blockade of the Strait of Gibraltar, securing the naval supply route to Spanish Morocco for the Nationalists early in the war.

In the article two conditions for a revolutionary situation were described, which were later succinctly phrased as \\"the bottoms don't want and the tops cannot live in the old way\\". In later works Lenin postulated a third condition: high political activity of the working masses, their readiness to revolutionary actions.The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, article \\"–†–µ–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–∞—è —Å–∏—Ç—É–∞—Ü–∏—è\\". Lenin describes the \\"revolutionary situation\\" as follows: \\"To the Marxist it is indisputable that a revolution is impossible without a revolutionary situation; furthermore, it is not every revolutionary situation that leads to revolution. What, generally speaking, are the symptoms of a revolutionary situation? We shall certainly not be mistaken if we indicate the following three major symptoms: (1) when it is impossible for the ruling classes to maintain their rule without any change; when there is a crisis, in one form or another, among the ‚Äúupper classes‚Äù, a crisis in the policy of the ruling class, leading to a fissure through which the discontent and indignation of the oppressed classes burst forth. For a revolution to take place, it is usually insufficient for ‚Äúthe lower classes not to want‚Äù to live in the old way; it is also necessary that ‚Äúthe upper classes should be unable‚Äù to rule in the old way; (2) when the suffering and want of the oppressed classes have grown more acute than usual; (3) when, as a consequence of the above causes, there is a considerable increase in the activity of the masses, who uncomplainingly allow themselves to be robbed in ‚Äúpeace time‚Äù, but, in turbulent times, are drawn both by all the circumstances of the crisis and by the ‚Äúupper classes‚Äù themselves into independent historical action. Without these objective changes, which are independent of the will, not only of individual groups and parties but even of individual classes, a revolution, as a general rule, is impossible. The totality of all these objective changes is called a revolutionary situation.\\" References Category:Marxist terminology Category:Revolution terminology Category:Vladimir Lenin ","title":"Revolutionary situation"},{"id":"42893600","text":"* The coordinates are missing.

With the Conservative party needing to gain one seat to gain a majority on the council for the first time since 1986, Colchester attracted national attention with the Shadow Foreign Secretary, William Hague, coming to the marginal Shrub End ward to campaign for the Conservatives. Meanwhile, one of the Green party's Principal Speakers Sian Berry came to Colchester and campaigned on the importance of public transport, with the Greens contesting every seat at the election. Election result The Conservatives narrowly failed to gain a majority on the council after failing to take Wivenhoe Quay from Labour by two votes after two recounts. This meant the Conservatives remained on 30 councillors, while the Liberal Democrats stayed on 21 seats. Labour's loss of Shrub End to the Conservatives meant they dropped to 6 councillors, while the Greens failed to win any seats despite getting 32% of the vote in Castle ward.

It is based on Muriel Spark's novel The Abbess of Crewe. Plot At the little-known and extremely wealthy Abbey of Philadelphia the Abbess, Sister Hildegard, is dying. She wishes her favorite, Sister Alexandra, to succeed her but dies moments before she can make her endorsement public. Alexandra conspires with Sisters Gertrude and Walburga to win the coming election, and to defeat her rival, Sister Felicity, who is openly carrying on an affair with a Jesuit priest, Father Thomas. Alexandra orders hidden microphones and cameras installed throughout the convent, and even hires a pair of Jesuit students, Gregory and Ambrose, to break in and steal Thomas's compromising letters from Sister Felicity's sewing box. The break-in is discovered, but the real meaning is kept hidden and Alexandra wins the election by a landslide. Once she is made Abbess, Alexandra expels and excommunicates Felicity, who begins a very public campaign to topple Alexandra. At the same time, the publicity brings the abbey to the attention of the Holy See, which discovers that the order is an unofficial one, with no actual ties to the Roman Catholic Church. To make matters worse, Gregory and Ambrose blackmail Gertrude and Walburga, who send the bungling Sister Winifred to pay them off only to have the whole scandal made public.

It was led by Fran Kurelac. According to Kurelac, standard language should be based on elements shared by most of the Slavic languages. Modern literary language should be based on archaic forms, so archaicity became the main characteristic of the language of school's proponents. Among such features where: * zero morpheme as the genitive plural ending (jelen, ≈æen, sel) * usage of dual in nouns and verbs (dvaju rukopisu, uvedosta me u kuƒáu) * first-person singular present form on -u (raduju se \\"I rejoice\\", as opposed to radujem se) * usage of the demonstrative pronoun s, si, se \\"this, that\\" (se jeseni \\"this autumn\\") * usage of infinitives without the final -i (pokazat) * usage of archaic Croatian words, Church Slavonicisms and words from other Slavic languages (bo≈æjaƒçki \\"poorly, miserably\\", naoƒçnjaci \\"glasses\\", paklina \\"resin\\", horugva \\"flag\\", batog \\"stick, club\\", rabota \\"work\\" etc.) Kurelac's enthusiasm for archaic forms provided a basis for his purist views. He was opposed to loanwords and calques from German, Italian and Ottoman Turkish, but a bit more tolerant towards the loanwords from Slavic languages.

These nektonic carnivores lived during the Jurassic period, from Oxfordian to Kimmeridgian age. Description Shells of Sowerbyceras can reach a diameter of about . Form is evolute, smooth, moderately thick, with rather flattened flanks.Ammonites Evolution of the genus Sowerbyceras  Sowerbyceras from the Kimmeridgian of Southern Alps (Northern Italy) show that the evolution of the Genus is strongly affected by fluctuations in sea level. In Southern Alps extinction and phyletic changes occur in transgressive phases instead of in regressive phases. Also the maxima and minima of intraspecific variability are the opposite to those of the epicontinental environment. During times of high sea-level (transgressive phases = slight bottom currents) Sowerbyceras faunas decreased in numbers, and were smaller, with a lower thickness ratio Wb/D (whorl breadth/Diameter) and a more evolute conch. During times of low sea-level (regressive phases = higher bottom currents) there is an increase in frequency of Sowerbyceras, which were larger, with a greater t.r. Wb/D, and a more involute conch. Morphological parameters D, Uw, wH, also vary with sea level. Sea-level lows (regressive phases) correspond to high intraspecific variability of D and lower intraspecific variability of Wb. Sea- level highs (trasgressive phases) correlate with lower intraspecific variability of D and higher intraspecific variability of Wb. New species do not originate from a population that presents a wide range of intraspecific variability, but the speciation only occurs when this variability decreases and the population is also numerically reduced. A transgressive phase led to a numerically small population of Sowerbyceras that in turn resulted in low intraspecific variability and as a consequence speciation occurred. This is of crucial importance for the survival of the species. In fact where, despite a low number of specimens, a high intraspecific variability is observed (at the top of the Beckeri-Pressulum Zone) Sowerbyceras became extinct in a short time. This observation is extremely important and assists the understanding of the process of extinction (From: \\"SARTI C. - 2003, Sea-level changes in the Kimmeridgian (Late Jurassic) and their effects on the phenotype evolution and dimorphism of the ammonite genus Sowerbyceras (Phylloceratina) and other ammonoid faunas from the distal pelagic swell area of the ‚ÄúTrento Plateau‚Äù (Southern Alps, Northern Italy): GeoActa, Vol.2, pp.115-144\\") Distribution Fossils of species within this genus have been found in the Jurassic of Algeria, France, Italy, Madagascar and Spain.

Biography As a son of Osorkon I, Iuwelot was brother of his predecessor Shoshenq C, of his successor Smendes III and of his contemporary king Takelot I. His earliest mention is on the so- called St√®le de l'apanage, from which is known that Iuwelot was a youth in Year 10 of Osorkon I. His name appears later as High Priest of Amun on a Nile Level Text at Karnak (no. 16), dating to a Year 5 of an unknown pharaoh. Scottish Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen argued that this king could not be Osorkon I, since it would implied that Iuwelot was already High Priest and Army commander of the South very early in his life; Kitchen thought it was much more likely that the unnamed pharaoh was Takelot I, and thus that Iuwelot must have been around 40 years old when he was appointed with such titles.Kitchen, op. cit., ¬ß 89; 96; 157. On the St√®le de l'apanage is reported that the northern limit of his jurisdiction as a military commander was the province of Asyut. Iuwelot's name appears also on other two Nile Level Texts (no. 20 and 21), but the name and regnal year of the king in question was deliberately omitted, although he could only have been Takelot I again.Kitchen, op. cit., ¬ß 270. This practice, which was continued by Iuwelot's brother and successor Smendes III, might suggest a sort of dispute in Upper Egypt in the succession following the death of Osorkon I, due to which the two priests may not have had the chance to take sides in favor of their brother.Gerard Broekman, \\"The Nile Level Records of the Twenty-Second and Twenty-Third Dynasties in Karnak\\", Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 88 (2002), pp. 170‚Äì173. He was succeeded by Smendes III around the mid-reign of Takelot.Kitchen, op. cit., ¬ß 157. =Family= Pectoral of Wasakawasa, son of Iuwelot In addition to his aforementioned brothers, other Iuwelot's relatives are known. On his Theban funerary stele (British Museum 1224), he is depicted together with his wife Tadenitenbast, here called \\"sister\\", both worshipping Ra- Horakhty. His son Wasakawasa is known by an electrum pectoral dedicated to Thoth, Lord of Hermopolis (Petrie Museum UC13124), although he will never become High Priest like the father.Kitchen, op. cit., ¬ß 270 n. 385. A daughter, Djed-ese-es-ankh, is also knownKitchen, op. cit., ¬ß 184. while another son, Khamweset, is mentioned on the St√®le de l'apanage as the beneficiary of his father's Theban possessions.

Despite its common name, tobacco root is not closely related to tobacco, but is instead more closely related to elderberry, honeysuckle, and teasel (Caprifoliaceae s.l.).  Description  Tobacco root is a long-lived herbaceous plant. Inflorescences are born on elongated, sparsely leaved stems usually around 0.75‚Äì1.5 meters tall. Flowers are small (0.5 mm diameter for pistillate flowers, 3‚Äì4 mm diameter for stamenate flowers) and cream or white.Meyer, F. G. 1951.

Ecology  Tobacco root typically grows in moist montane meadows and subalpine parks between elevation, although herbarium collections are reported several hundred meters higher. Growth data indicate that individual plants may live up to 300 years. The small, shallow flowers of tobacco root make its pollen and nectar resources available to a wide range of small, generalist pollinators. In Colorado, solitary bees, flies, and moths are the most frequent floral visitors.Muenchow, G. 1985. The evolution of dioecy: patterns and pollination.

It includes a pride parade and film festival events. The festival lasts for a week or two, and usually takes place in late May to early June. As it was the only queer culture festival in Korea until 2009, when Daegu Queer Culture Festival began, it was also commonly called Korea Queer Festival or Queer Culture Festival (). This event is Korea's largest LGBT festival. History Participants of the Festival '14 The festival first took place in the year 2000. The pride parade that year took place in the Daehangno area and reportedly had 50 attendees; some onlookers \\"cursed and yelled aggressively\\". Since 2001 the festival has included a film festival, Korea Queer Film Festival (KQFF). The 9th edition in 2009 around the Cheonggye cheon area had a much larger number of participants and a more peaceful atmosphere. The 10th edition of the festival in 2010 was held in the Jongno area of Seoul. The event was also attended by representatives of a number of Korean NGOs, including Baram Sory, the Korean Gay Men‚Äôs Human Rights Group, the Korean Lesbian Foundation, the Lesbian Counseling Center in South Korea, Korean Womenlink, Outeen, Unninetwork and Project Butchway 2010 film studio. In 2011, the 12th edition of the festival was held in the Hanbit Media Park, Cheonggyecheon area of Seoul. Churches and political parties were among that year's festival participants. The 14th edition of the festival took place in the Hongdae area of Seoul and gathered about 10,000 attendants, a record number. Like most editions it featured a pride parade and a film festival. Notable attendees included Korean LGBT celebrities Harisu and Kim Jho Kwang- soo. The Festival in 2014 was disrupted by a number of protesters. Here, one of the protesters is holding a sign in front of the festival's stage. The 15th edition of the festival, taking place in early June 2014 in the Sinchon area of Seoul, near Yonsei University, declared its goal as protesting against \\"the oppression of LGBT people in Russia and Korea, and show support and solidarity within the LGBT community\\". The 2014 festival lasts over a week, and events include a pride parade and a film festival. The 2014 edition received official support from Google. The festival organizers have reported that days before the festival was about to start, the government withdrew permission from them, declaring it \\"inappropriate\\" in light of the recent Sinking of the MV Sewol tragedy; but the organizers have stated that they believe this is a pretext used by unfriendly Christian groups trying to sabotage the festival by sending numerous complaints to the government. The organizers were prepared to disobey the authorities and hold the event even without official permission. The festival drew an estimated 10,000-15,000 attendees. The government officials did not prevent the festival from taking place, but also issued permission to conservative, religious anti-LGBT rights groups to hold rallies at the same time and location. This led to a number of disruptions and delays. The parade was banned in 2015. This has attracted international attention to the event, with most of it being critical of the progress made regarding LGBT rights in South Korea. Human Rights Watch has expressed concern in a public online letter to the President of Korea. Political Endorsements The event attracts support from small Korean political parties, the Democratic Labor Party and New Progressive Party; more conservative members of Korean government take a neutral stance towards the event. The festival receives no significant support from the government. In 2017, National Human Rights Commission of Korea participated in the festival for the first time as a government agency. Privacy Concerns Unlike many other similar events worldwide, this Korean festival actively limits the ability of attendees to take pictures or videos. Until 2010 the organizers issued no-photography stickers, ribbons and bands; since then they require registration for all photographers and video recorders and are asking photo-takers to blur participants' faces before publishing pictures online. In 2012 face masks and sunglasses, obscuring participants' features, were reported as common. This is done in order to reduce the chance of accidental outing of participants, who still face significant discrimination in Korean society. In fact anti-gay protesters have been known to take pictures of participants and distribute them in order to embarrass the attendees.
