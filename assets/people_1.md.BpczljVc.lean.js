Avildsen, starring Christopher Atkins as a college student and Lesley Ann Warren as his professor. The film's screenplay was written by Joan Tewkesbury. Film critics widely panned the film, but the film itself became better known for Bryan Adams' chart-topping single \\"Heaven\\". Plot Outspoken and overconfident Rick Monroe is a jock and a popular guy in college in Titusville, Florida. At the end of his final report for his class, Rick cracks a joke and his prim and proper speech professor, Faye Hanlon, is not amused. After chiding him for his joke, she decides to fail him and make him take the course over again. Faye is going through a slump in her marriage to Whitney Hanlon, a rocket scientist who has just been laid off. Faye's free-spirited sister Patsy, visiting from Chicago, takes her to a strip club to cheer her up. The show features a performer called \\"Ricky the Rocket\\", who is none other than Faye's student Rick. When he notices Faye in the crowd, he gives her a very special lap dance, kissing her in the process. The next day, Faye and Rick run into each other at a school function. Initially, Rick is interested only in convincing Faye to allow him another chance at his final and is rebuffed. He realizes that she is attracted to him and begins flirting. Faye arranges to meet Patsy near her hotel, only to discover that she has been tricked into seeing another performance by \\"Ricky the Rocket\\". Since Patsy has to return home a day early, she turns over use of her hotel room to Faye, who calls Whitney and lies that she and Patsy are staying at Patsy's hotel together. Coincidentally, Rick's mother works in the same hotel, and while visiting his mother, Rick runs into Faye again; they return to Faye's room and have sex. Faye must leave and in her absence, Rick invites his girlfriend Slick to the room where she has sex with him as well. Faye catches them in the shower and, humiliated, flees; she realizes that she has been deceived. Whitney, returning home from an unsuccessful job interview, discovers that Patsy has gone home. Whitney travels to the hotel, where he catches Rick as the latter is exiting. He kidnaps Rick at gunpoint, takes Rick to a skiff at a small dock, and forces him to strip. Rick, sobbing, complies. Whitney threatens Rick repeatedly, but ultimately only shoots holes in the skiff, leaving a naked Rick aboard as it sinks. Faye returns home to find Whitney waiting for her; she apologizes and he forgives her. At the end, the couple talk about their problems and resolve them.

Hailing the beetle as a \\"herald of prosperity,\\" it stands as the world's first monument built to honor an agricultural pest. The Monument consists of a statue of a woman holding a pedestal with a boll weevil perched on top.  Story  Historical Marker by the monument, at the intersection of Main and College. The boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis), sometimes referred to as the \\"Mexican cotton boll weevil\\" was indigenous to Mexico, but appeared in Alabama in 1915. By 1918 farmers were losing whole crops of cotton. H. M. Sessions saw this as an opportunity to convert the area to peanut farming. In 1916 he convinced C. W. Baston, an indebted farmer, to back his venture. The first crop paid off their debts and was bought by farmers seeking to change to peanut farming. Cotton was grown again, but farmers learned to diversify their crops, a practice which brought new money to Coffee County. Bon Fleming, a local businessman, came up with the idea to build a statue and helped to finance the cost. As a tribute to how something disastrous can be a catalyst for change, and a reminder of how the people of Enterprise adjusted in the face of adversity, the monument was dedicated on December 11, 1919 at the intersection of College and Main Street, the heart of the town's business district. =Description= The monument depicts a female figure in a flowing gown with arms stretched above her head. She raises high a trophy topped by an enlarged-scale boll weevil. The statue stands atop an ornately detailed base which supports two round streetlamps. The base stands in the center of a fountain, which is surrounded by a wrought-iron railing. The monument stands more than tall. At the base of the monument appears the following inscription: The original statue of the woman, excluding the fountain and boll weevil, was built in Italy for approximately $1,800. The boll weevil was not added until thirty years later, when Luther Baker thought the Boll Weevil Monument should have a boll weevil on it. He made the boll weevil and mounted it atop the statue. The nearby Depot Museum houses the original statue. =Vandalism= The boll weevil, and sometimes even the entire monument, has been repeatedly stolen throughout the years. Each time it was found and repaired by the city of Enterprise until July 11, 1998. On that day vandals ripped the boll weevil out of the statue's hands and permanently damaged the statue. City leaders were going to repair the original statue and put it back, but it proved too difficult and costly. A polymer-resin replica was erected in its place in downtown Enterprise in 1998, and the original is on display at Enterprise's Depot Museum, a few hundred feet away at 106 Railroad Street. A nearby security camera monitors the monument for further vandalism. In recent memory, dish soap has been poured into the monument fountain resulting in mounds of suds in and around the monument area.  In popular culture  The monument is featured in the original songs \\"The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota\\" by \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic and \\"Southern Air\\" from Ray Stevens' album Surely You Joust. The monument was referenced by Boss Hogg in an episode of The Dukes of Hazzard.

Early life Alex Steinweiss was born on March 24, 1917, in Brooklyn. His father was a women's shoe designer from Warsaw and his mother was a seamstress from Riga, Latvia. They moved to the Lower East Side of Manhattan and eventually settled in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn. Steinweiss said he was destined to be a commercial artist. He studied under Leon Friend at Abraham Lincoln High School, and his classmates marveled that he \\"could take a brush, dip it in some paint and make letters,\\" he recalled. \\"So I said to myself, 'If some day I could become a good sign painter, that would be terrific!\\"' Steinweiss earned a scholarship to the Parsons School of Design. Career After graduation Steinweiss worked for three years for the Austrian poster designer Joseph Binder, whose flat color and simplified human figures were popular at the time and influenced his own work. In the 1930s recorded music was sold in plain packaging, or record shop advertising 'bags'; sets of discs were also usually issued in plain albums. However, colored artwork had been used on special albums, from World War I. This was separately printed and pasted onto album covers and occasionally inside the albums: for example, HMV's issue of Liza Lehmann's \\"In a Persian Garden\\" and operettas by Edward German and Gilbert & Sullivan were all available by 1918 in such decorated albums.Brian Rust (intro.) Gramophone Records of the First World War, Newton Abbot (UK): David & Charles, n.d. [1975] In 1938, Alex Steinweiss was the first art director for Columbia Records, where he introduced a wider application of album covers and cover art. \\"They were so drab, so unattractive,\\" said Steinweiss, \\"I convinced the executives to let me design a few.\\" During World War II, Steinweiss became Columbia Records' advertising manager. He left for a job at the Navy's Training and Development Center in New York City, where he produced teaching materials and cautionary posters. After the war, Steinweiss freelanced for Columbia. During one lunch meeting there, the company's president, Ted Wallerstein, introduced him to an innovation that the company was about to unveil: the long-playing record. But there was a problem. The heavy, folded kraft paper used to protect 78 rpm records left marks on the vinyl microgroove when 33 1/3 rpm LPs were stacked. Steinweiss was asked to develop a jacket for the new format and, with help from his brother-in-law, found a manufacturer, Imperial Paper Box, that was willing to invest about $250,000 in equipment. Louis Sukoff from Imperial Paper Box held the patent for the phonograph record housing also known as the record jacket. Steinweiss was active in record cover design from 1938 until 1973, when he semi-retired to devote himself to painting. By his own admission, he designed roughly 2500 covers. His career can be divided into roughly five periods: From 1938 to perhaps 1945, he designed all the covers for Columbia. During this period, he developed the entire graphic \\"language\\" of album design. The second period is from 1945 to roughly 1950, during which he was no longer the sole designer for Columbia. He also began designing for other companies. This period is sometimes described as the \\"First Golden Age\\" of the album cover. Steinweiss' signature font, the \\"Steinweiss scrawl,\\" first appeared in roughly 1947. Steinweiss claims to have invented the LP cover, which first appeared in 1948. Steinweiss can also take credit for the Grecian column design Columbia used in 1948 on the first LP envelopes. The design was borrowed from the earlier 78 rpm album cover, MM577, the Mendelssohn violin concerto played by Nathan Milstein. This performance was chosen by Columbia to be the first 12-inch LP, ML4001. Starting in around 1950, Steinweiss did the covers and record label for Remington, and began a more than 20-year association with both Decca and London Records. Like his earlier periods, most of his early 1950s designs are drawn, for Columbia, RCA, Remington, Decca and London. This was his third period, when he did drawing, lettering, and layout that was often brilliant but perhaps not as memorable as his late 1940s period. It was during this period that he collaborated with Margaret Bourke-White on a memorable series of covers for Columbia. Starting in the mid-1950s, Steinweiss added photography to his palette. Steinweiss's photographic covers are remarkably distinctive. He utilized strange garish colors, odd lighting, and numerous visual puns and reference points. He continued to work for Decca and London, and did the entire series of covers (and the logo and label) for the startup Everest label from 1958 until about 1960. This was his fourth period, characterized by photography but continuing to use the entire range of tools he had developed. Steinweiss' final period of record cover design was from 1960 to roughly 1973, again working for Decca and London. His new developments of the period were in die-cut designs and collage. Steinweiss's cover for the original Broadway cast recording of South Pacific (1949) has been in almost continuous use ever since for the 78rpm set, the LP, the 45rpm set, various tape formats and the CD. The only other graphic design in America to be used for so many years is the Coca-Cola bottle. In 1942, Steinweiss hired Jim Flora, which launched Flora's 40+ year career as a commercial artist. In 2001, Steinweiss was featured in Carlo McCormick's gallery show \\"The LP Show,\\" originating in New York's Exit Art and then in 2002 traveling to the Experience Music Project in Seattle and The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.Lafreniere, Steve: \\"Covers story: Steve Lafreniere on 'The LP Show'\\", ArtForum, Summer 2002. He was interviewed for a chapter in Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture (The MIT Press, 2008) edited by Paul D. Miller a.k.a. DJ Spooky. Death Alex Steinweiss died on July 18, 2011 in Sarasota, Florida. His death was confirmed by his son. In addition to his son, he is survived by a daughter, Hazel Steinweiss, six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. Awards In 1998, Steinweiss was inducted into the Art Directors Club Hall of Fame. In 2003, CMP Information and the International Recording Media Association created the Alex Awards for Excellence in album cover art, which were named in honor of Alex Steinweiss.

Printers with capacities over 100\\" wide are considered super-wide or grand format. Wide-format printers are used to print banners, posters, trade show graphics, wallpaper, murals, backlit film (duratrans), vehicle image wraps, electronic circuit schematics, architectural drawings, construction plans, backdrops for theatrical and media sets, and any other large format artwork or signage. Wide-format printers usually employ some variant of inkjet or toner-based technology to produce the printed image; and are more economical than other print methods such as screen printing for most short-run (low quantity) print projects, depending on print size, run length (quantity of prints per single original), and the type of substrate or print medium. Wide-format printers are usually designed for printing onto a roll of print media that feeds incrementally during the print process, rather than onto individual sheets. Technologies Wide-format printers can be categorized by the type of ink transfer process they employ: *Aqueous: Thermal or Piezo inkjet printers using an ink known as aqueous or water-based. The term water base is a generally accepted misnomer. The pigment is held in a non-reactive carrier solution that is sometimes water and other times a substitute liquid, including a soy-based liquid used by Kodak. Aqueous ink generally comes in two flavors, dye and pigment. Dye ink is high color, low UV-resistant variety that offers the widest color gamut. Pigment ink is generally duller in color, requiring more inks to achieve wide inks but withstands fading from UV rays. Similar in general principle to desktop inkjet printers. Finished prints must be laminated to protect them if they are to be used outdoors. Various substrates (media) are available, including canvases, banners, metabolized plastic, and cloth. Aqueous technology requires that all materials be properly coated to accept and hold the ink. *Solvent: This term is used to describe any ink that is not water-based. Piezo inkjet printers whose inks use petroleum or a petroleum by-product such as an acetone like carrier liquid. \\"Eco-Solvent\\" inks usually contain glycol esters or glycol ether esters and are slower drying. The resulting prints are waterproof. May be used to print directly on uncoated vinyl and other media as well as ridged substrates such as Painted/Coated Metal, Foam Board and PVC. The solvents soften the base material and allow the ink pigments to mechanically latch on to the chemically etched surface. Certain ink manufacturers have different bite based on what solvent carriers they use. Which is what makes solvent ink prints more durable than aqueous inks. However, solvent inks give off strong odor or fumes when drying, as the carrier fluid dissipates through applied heat from the printer's platen. There are various levels of solvent ink ranging from \\"True or Full Solvent\\" to \\"Medium/Mild Solvent\\" all the way down to \\"Eco-Solvent\\". The fume and odour levels decrease accordingly, so does the surface etch of the base material. Full to Medium/Mild Solvents require fume extraction to be considered safe in the working environment. Most Eco-Solvents can be used in an office environment with minimal or tolerable odor levels. *Dye sublimation: Inks are diffused into the special print media to produce continuous-tone prints of photographic quality. *UV: Piezo inkjet printers whose inks are UV-curable (dry when cured with UV light). The resulting prints are waterproof, embossed & vibrant. Any media material can be used in this technology, polymer made media are best. Ceramics, glass, metals, and woods are also used with printing with this technology. *Pen/plotter: A pen or pens are used to draw on the print substrate. Mainly used for producing CAD drawings. Generally superseded by digital technologies such as Solvent, Aqueous, and UV.

It begins at the intersection of Preston Road and Loop 12/Northwest Highway in Dallas. The Preston Road designation comes from the fact that the highway generally follows the course of an older road known as the Preston Trail, which ran to the town of Preston [Bend] . Preston is now submerged by Lake Texoma. The road is known as Preston all the way north through the remainder of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex to a junction with State Highway 56 west of Sherman, near the Oklahoma border (except for the portion through Gunter, which is designated as 8th Street). Preston Road passes through many of the fast-growing northern Dallas suburbs, including Frisco and Plano, as well as Prosper and Celina, with many new housing developments being built along Preston. History On September 26, 1939, this route was renumbered from part of SH 14. Prior to June 28, 1989, SH 289 began north of downtown Dallas in the Oak Lawn neighborhood at its intersection with Pearl Street. From there, the highway designation followed Cedar Springs Road northeast for less than a block, and upon an intersection with Maple Avenue, ran northwest up that street. Less than a mile later at an intersection with Oak Lawn Avenue, the highway designation turned northeast up Oak Lawn, which it followed into Highland Park. There, it was known as Oak Lawn Avenue until an intersection with Armstrong Parkway, where it became Preston Road. On October 30, 1958, SH 289 was extended northward 3.6 miles. Preston Road is one of the most congested highways in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, but due to urban growth along the highway, room to add additional lanes is minimal, and no means exist to upgrade the road to freeway status without incurring significant cost to demolish businesses along the path. Instead, the nearby Dallas North Tollway generally parallels Preston Road. On June 28, 1989, the section of SH 289 from Loop 12 to a deleted section of Loop 354 was cancelled. On November 19, 2009, an extension of SH 289 was completed from its previous terminus at SH 56 northward to a new connection with Farm to Market Road 120 near Pottsboro, Texas, another segment of the old Preston Trail, which ends on the south shore of Lake Texoma. (FM 120 north of the connection has been renamed as State Highway 289, except for a very small segment northeast of the intersection, which was renamed as Spur 316.) SH 289 officially ends at Elks Boulevard; the actual road continues for another 3–4 miles before ending at a local street in the Preston Bend community.

The best-known version is produced around the Mediterranean; similar foods are the Japanese karasumi, which is softer, and Korean eoran, from mullet or freshwater drum. It has many names and is prepared in various ways. Names and etymology The English name, bottarga, was borrowed from Italian.; 1st edition The Italian form is thought to have been introduced from the Arabic buṭarḫah بطارخة (plural buṭariḫ بطارخ), itself from Byzantine Greek (oiotárikhon) < 'egg' + τάριχον 'pickled'. The Italian form can be dated to ca. 1500, since the Greek form transliterated into Latin as ova tarycha occurs in Bartolomeo Platina's De Honesta Voluptate (ca. 1474), the earliest printed cookbook, and an Italian manuscript dating shortly afterward that \\"closely parallels\\" this cookbook attests to botarghe in the corresponding passage.. Italian MS in the Bitting Collection in the Rare Book Room of the United States Library of Congress. In Platina, the word is the Latin transliteration of \\"\\" The first mention of the Greek form (oiotárikhon) occurs in the eleventh century in the writings of Simeon Seth, who denounced the food as something to be \\"avoided totally\\",Andrew Dalby, Siren Feasts, 1996, , p.189 although a similar phrase may have been in use since antiquity in the same denotation. 'eggs [of fish] preserved by salting', citing Diphilus of Siphnos quoted in Athenaeus III, 121 C. It has been suggested that the Coptic outarakhon might be the intermediate form between Greek and Arabic, whereas examination of dialectical variants of Greek 'egg' include Pontic Greek ὠβόν (traditionally where the mullets are caught) and ὀβό or βό in parts of Asia Minor. The modern Greek name comes from the Byzantine Greek, substituting the modern word αυγό for the ancient word . History Bottarga production is first documented in the Nile Delta in the 10th century BCE.Dino Joannides, Semplice: Real Italian Food: Ingredients and Recipes, 2014, , s.v.Mark Kurlansky, Salt: A World History, Knopf, 2011, , p. 39 In the 15th century, Martino da Como describes the production of bottarga by salting then smoking to dry it.Maestro Martino da Como, trans. Stefania Barzini, The Art of Cooking: The First Modern Cookery Book, 2005, , p. 112 Preparation Bottarga of bluefin tuna from Favignana, Sicily Bottarga is made chiefly from the roe pouch of grey mullet. Sometimes it is prepared from Atlantic bluefin tuna (bottarga di tonno rosso) or yellowfin tuna. It is massaged by hand to eliminate air pockets, then dried and cured in sea salt for a few weeks. The result is a hard, dry slab. Formerly, it was generally coated in beeswax to preserve it, as it still is in Greece and Egypt. The curing time may vary depending on the producer and the desired texture as well as the preference of the consumers, which varies by country. Bottarga usually is sliced thinly or grated when it is served. RegionsCroatia= In Croatia, the delicacy is known as butarga or butarda. It is usually fried before serving. =Egypt= Bottarga is produced in the Port Said area. It is commonly pronounced Batarekh all over Egypt. =France= The usual French name is boutargue; in Provence, it is called poutargue and produced in the city of Martigues. =Greece= The Byzantine 10th century physician Simeon Seth's instruction on ootaricho (the medieval Greek form of the word): avoid it totally.

Its culinary properties may be compared to those of dry anchovies, although it is much more expensive. Often, it is served with olive oil or lemon juice as an appetizer accompanied by bread or crostini. It is also used in pasta dishes.

It is usually made from a variety of roes including, among others, grey mullet, tuna, bonito, or even black drum or common ling (the latter two somewhat cheaper and less valued).

In an 1812 reference book (A System of Geography, Ancient and Modern by James Playfair, Hill, p. 695) it is spelled Benischau, with a German suffix. On an 1880 map of Silesia it is spelled Beneschau. In 1846 Salomon Mayer Rothschild, who owned the ironworks in nearby Vítkovice, acquired Benešov Palace, probably then spelled Palace Benisowa (of the Benis family). During World War II, the village, then still known locally as Beneschau, was the base for a working party (E444) of British and Commonwealth prisoners of war, under the administration of Stalag VIIIB/344 at Łambinowice (then known as Lamsdorf) in Poland.

The Dallas North Tollway was the first toll road in the United States to implement electronic toll collection technology, with the introduction of the TollTag in 1989. TollTag users were originally charged $0.05 extra per transaction, but by 1999, the agency moved to the active encouragement of TollTag use by giving tag users a discount off the cash toll rate. In August 2007, the NTTA announced plans to phase out manned toll booths entirely by May 2010. The Tollway was converted to all- electronic toll collection on December 11, 2010. North of I-635, the Dallas North Tollway is accompanied by frontage roads, which are designated as Dallas Parkway for address purposes. This is attributed to when Dallas Parkway was a major thoroughfare before being converted to the current Tollway configuration.https://maps.google.com/maps/place?ftid=0x864c3c866a95acd3:0xfdcab511df21126&q;=Dallas+Parkway,+Dallas,+TX&hl;=en&ved;=0CAwQ- gswAA&sa;=X&ei;=TsThUOSXB6eIwQGa94GgCA Dallas Pkwy, Dallas Google Maps History The Texas Legislature created the Turnpike Act on June 9, 1953, thereby creating the Texas Turnpike Authority. The Texas Turnpike Authority began issuing bonds on in 1955 for its second project, the first 30 mile section of the Dallas North Tollway. The original cost was $33,650,000 and started in 1966 and completed from Interstate 35E near downtown Dallas north to Royal Lane in 1968, and soon after to Interstate 635. Toll Controversy: J.H. \\"Jack\\" Davis, Engineer-Manager for the Texas Turnpike Authority, stated in 1968 that \\"When revenue bonds for a project are finally paid off, however, the facility reverts to the state as part of its highway system, to be used free.\\" This was supposed to happen the same way the Texas Turnpike Authority turned over the Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike to the Highway Department in 1977 to become I-30, which then became toll free. However, the Dallas North Tollway never became toll free and has never been turned over to the Highway Department. The North Texas Tollway Authority's web site states that \\"it was no longer a statewide practice to remove tolls from roadways due to a lack of state funding to maintain the roadways\\". While it may have been Jack Davis' unofficial intent, it was not law. The last bond payment was made January 1, 2005. The Texas Legislature created the North Texas Tollway Authority in June of 1997, replacing the Texas Turnpike Authority on September 1, 1997. The Regional Tollway Authority Act, Chapter 366 of the Texas Transportation Code, is what authorizes the North Texas Tollway Authority, thereby making it a political subdivision of the State of Texas and the operator of the North Dallas Tollway. DNT at the Spring Valley Road interchangeThe initial segment of the tollway ran from Interstate 35E to Royal Lane along an old St. Louis Southwestern Railway corridor. The right-of-way is generally along this segment, one of the narrowest controlled-access roads in Texas. The segment was completed in June 1968 and toll was originally 20 cents. The tollway was later extended to Briargrove Lane in 1987, to Headquarters Drive in 1994, to S.H. 121 and Gaylord Parkway in 2004, and to US 380 in 2007. The extensions generally parallel S.H. 289, also known as Preston Road. The \\"DNT Extension Phase 3,\\" which runs from State Highway 121 to U.S. Highway 380, opened in mid-2007. Current tolls vary from $0.40 to $2.15 for a car with it being more expensive closer to downtown; the lone exception is the Eldorado Pkwy. toll plaza in Frisco. The Tolltag offers a discount on these rates (tolls are $0.30 to $1.41) but requires a prepayment of $40 for up to three transponders, and after that, TollTag accounts can be reloaded at a minimum of $10. Rates increased in September 2009 and will increase every two years. All toll plazas are now equipped for electronic toll collection and main lane plazas feature TollTag express lanes. Route description DNT at the Harry Hines Boulevard interchange The Dallas North Tollway begins at an interchange with I-35E and Harry Hines Boulevard in the Victory Park and Market Center areas of Dallas. Southbound traffic from the Tollway going onto I-35E must first get on the access road before entering onto the main freeway. At Wycliff Avenue in Oak Lawn the Tollway has its first toll plaza. The Tollway has its first northbound exit at Lemmon Avenue before entering into Highland Park. The city streets of Eastern Avenue and Roland Avenue run alongside the Tollway on the southbound and northbound sides respectively. Due to passing through a heavily populated area, high noise cancelling walls line the Tollway with numerous signs warning drivers about limited sight distance. At the Mockingbird Lane interchange, the Dallas North Tollway briefly enters into University Park before returning to Dallas. Between Loop 12 and Northaven Road, the Tollway runs about a 1/4 mile west of SH 289 (Preston Road).DNT facing north from the University Boulevard overpassThe Tollway interchanges with I-635 (LBJ Freeway) near the Galleria Dallas and runs along the eastern edge of Farmers Branch and enters into Addison. At the Dallas-Collin county line, the Tollway enters into extreme North Dallas and has an interchange with the President George Bush Turnpike and enters the city of Plano. The Dallas North Tollway runs by many shopping centers and housing developments. Going through northern Plano, the Tollway passes by the corporate headquarters of Pizza Hut. The Tollway interchanges with SH 121/Sam Rayburn Tollway and enters into Frisco, passing by the Dr Pepper Ballpark. Development along the Tollway begins to thin before it picks up again near Main Street, passing by Toyota Stadium. Development thins again before the Tollway runs through rural areas of north Frisco. The Dallas North Tollway ends at an interchange with US 380, with Dallas Parkway continuing north as a county road. Future At the Tollway's southern end, near downtown, the agency has rebuilt the road around the main toll plaza and added ramps at Oak Lawn Avenue. This project, started in 2006, ended in late fall 2008. On the southern sector of the tollway, the agency plans to spend about US$43 million to add an entrance and exit at Oak Lawn and rebuild most of the tollway surface from the Interstate 35E ramps to Lemmon Avenue. The tollway authority has completely rebuilt the aging toll plaza, adding a third TollTag express lane in each direction. This work coincides with major projects by the city of Dallas to rebuild part of Oak Lawn under the tollway, and by Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) to build a rail line along nearby Harry Hines Boulevard. The North Texas Tollway Authority started work in January 2006 at seven north Dallas locations to improve ramps and add merging lanes. The project cost US$14 million. Northbound projects included adding acceleration or auxiliary lanes between Keller Springs and Trinity Mills roads and between Alpha and Spring Valley roads. Southbound projects include adding outside lane pavement at the President George Bush Turnpike exit; between the Bush Turnpike entrance ramp and Frankford Road; between the Frankford entrance ramp and Sojourn Drive; around the Keller Springs exit at the main lane toll plaza; and between the Keller Springs toll plaza and Spring Valley. The projects would noticeably lengthen many shorter merging lanes, including one at Trinity Mills where vehicles must merge quickly after driving around a curve. Having completed the third extension north, NTTA plans to further extend Dallas Parkway from US 380 to the Grayson County line. It is planned to be a extension. A two-lane county road was upgraded from US 380 to Farm to Market Road 428 in Celina and is currently open to traffic. North of FM 428, a route has been established, but construction is far from complete. The tollway would end at US 82 if they finish the Gunter Plan. By the mid-2030s it will be launched to US 82. This will be a $1,200 million project, ready to be built. Work on the tollway began near US 380 in 2017. On February 27, 2020, the proposed section from the Denton/Collin/Grayson County Line to Farm to Market Road 121 was designated as FM 121 Spur. Exit list Due to the continuous frontage road system north of I-635, those exits serve more than one roadway. This table lists the combined destinations as they would be viewed when traveling in the northbound direction, though southbound exits will occasionally be grouped in a different way. NTTA does not provide mile reference markers or exit numbers. However, reference markers are provided at intervals along the major corridors. These markers are installed on the top of the concrete traffic barrier along the DNT corridor. The reference marker corresponds to the station of the alignment in the construction plans.

Release and reception The film's three reels were respectively released on February 21, 24, and 25, 1911. Many film exhibitors at this time were hesitant to screen pictures of more than one reel, believing that audiences would not tolerate anything longer. The Moving Picture World, however, called for all three reels of A Tale of Two Cities to be screened back-to-back, which possibly inspired Vitagraph to issue its future multi-reel pictures as a single release. According to The Moving Picture World, the staging of the first reel \\"is little short of sumptuous. There is shown a care in the attention to details which stamps the picture as an unusually faithful reproduction and affords opportunity for those who have read and loved Dickens in the books to see his story move before them, much, perhaps, as it moved before him during its composition.\\" The magazine later listed A Tale of Two Cities among a group of films that adapted classic subjects, positing that these adaptations represented an upward trend of artistic quality in the film industry. The director Rex Ingram wrote in 1922: \\"In 1913, when I was studying drawings and sculpture at the Yale School of Fine Arts, a motion picture play, founded upon Charles Dickens' famous story A Tale of Two Cities, came to New Haven. It followed in the wake of many cut and dried one-reel subjects, and while this picture was necessarily full of imperfections, common to all pioneer films, it marked a tremendous step ahead in the making of them...I left the theatre greatly impressed; absolutely convinced that it would be through the medium of the film play, to the production of which the laws that govern the fine arts had been applied, that a universal understanding and appreciation of art finally would be reached.\\"Quoted in Due to the film's enormous success, Vitagraph reissued A Tale of Two Cities in 1913.

It has around 5,500 inhabitants. It lies about south of Opava. The town is dominated by a castle complex. History The area around Hradec nad Moravicí was first settled approximately between 3000 and 2700 BC. A fort was built in the 8th century, which by the 11th century had a full military garrison. The fort was built up into a Romanesque–Gothic castle under the Přemyslid dynasty. The town suffered during the Thirty Years War and lost its city rights for a short time. In 1778, the castle was purchased by the princes of the house of Lichnovský, who would remain there until 1945. The town experienced significant industrial growth in 19th century and a railway was connected to the town in 1905. Before World War I, according to the 1910 Austrian census, the town had 329 inhabitants, 314 of whom had permanent residence there. The census asked people for their native language: 169 (53.8%) were German-speaking and 144 (45.9%) were Czech-speaking. The largest religious group was Roman Catholics with 327 (99.4%).Ludwig Patryn (ed): Die Ergebnisse der Volkszählung vom 31. Dezember 1910 in Schlesien, Troppau 1912.

Seated, left to right Walter Granger, Professor H.F. Osborn, Dr. W.D. Matthew; standing, F. Schneider, Prof. R.S. Lull, Albert Thomson, Peter Kaison Richard Swann Lull (November 6, 1867 - April 22, 1957) was an American paleontologist and Sterling Professor at Yale University who is largely remembered now for championing a non- Darwinian view of evolution, whereby mutation(s) could unlock presumed \\"genetic drives\\" that, over time, would lead populations to increasingly extreme phenotypes (and perhaps, ultimately, to extinction). Life Lull was born in Annapolis, Maryland, the son of naval officer Edward Phelps Lull and Elizabeth Burton, daughter of General Henry Burton. He married Clara Coles Boggs and he has a daughter Dorothy. He majored in zoology at Rutgers College where he received both his undergraduate and master's degrees (M.S. 1896). He worked for the Division of Entomology of the United States Department of Agriculture, but in 1894 became an assistant professor of zoology at the State Agricultural College in Amherst, Massachusetts (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst). Lull's interest in fossil footprints began at Amherst College, renowned for its collection of fossil footprints, and eventually led him to switch from entomology to paleontology. In 1899 Lull worked as a member of the American Museum of Natural History's expedition to Bone Cabin Quarry, Wyoming, helping to collect that museum's brontosaur skeleton. In 1902 he again joined an American Museum team in Montana, then studied under Columbia University Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborn. In 1903 he received his Ph.D. from Columbia University, and in 1906, after a brief time at Amherst, was named Assistant Professor of Vertebrate Paleontology in Yale College and Associate Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology at the Peabody Museum of Natural History. He stayed at Yale for the next 50 years. In 1933 Lull was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. One famous example he used to support his non-Darwinian evolution theory concerned the enormous antlers of the Irish elk: he argued that these could not possibly be the result of natural selection, and instead reflected one of his \\"unlocked genetic drives\\" towards ever increasing antler size. The poor elk, coping in each generation with ever-bigger antlers were eventually driven extinct. His evolutionary theory was a form of orthogenesis. His book Organic Evolution (1917) received positive reviews and was described as an \\"excellent summary of the theories, facts, and factors of evolution.\\"Anonymous. (1917).

In criminal cases, the writ of attaint was issued at the suit of the Crown, and in civil cases at the suit of either party. The correctness of the verdict would be determined by a body known as the grand jury of attaint. This panel, consisting of twenty-four members, was twice the size of a normal trial jury. The party bringing the attaint could introduce only the same evidence that was originally given at trial while the jury whose verdict was questioned was allowed to present new matter.

He was one of the last members to bear a family name that is documented to have become extinct in modern times (the last male died in 1985). The name lives on in three company names connected to Harry's family: the engineering firm of Accles & Shelvoke Ltd in Sutton Coldfield; Shelvoke, Pickering, Janney LLP, a firm of chartered accountants in Cannock, Staffordshire; and Shelvokes Financial Services Ltd at the same address. Harry Shelvoke was born in Aston, Birmingham, and lived in Handsworth for about 30 years. He married Minnie Sinigar (another surname now extinct in Britain) (1877-1937) in 1901. After she died, and now living in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, he married Gilberte Beeckman (1903-1970) in 1940. He died childless in 1962 in Suffolk, aged 84. Work The Lacre Motor Car Company Ltd was an important early commercial vehicle manufacturer. Lacre was a contraction of Long Acre, London, where the business started in 1902. It moved to the expanding Letchworth Garden City in 1910. In 1911 Harry joined it as general manager. James Drewry (1882-1952) was chief engineer. Together they conceived a design for an ingenious lorry, called the \\"Freighter\\", and built the prototype in Harry's barn. Since Lacre were not interested in producing this vehicle, they left to form Shelvoke and Drewry in 1922, with 30 employees. In 1937 it became a public company, with Harry Shelvoke as managing director. He was chairman of the company from 1949 to 1957. During this time, the company made buses, refuse collection vehicles and fork lift trucks, as well as trailers, miniature submarines and other items for the Second World War. Shelvoke and Drewry later became incorporated into Shelvoke Dempster, Dennis Shelvoke, and other spin-off companies. Related companies The firm of Accles & Shelvoke was formed in 1913 by J G Accles and G E Shelvoke (Harry's brother), to commence the manufacture of cartridge-powered captive bolt stunning equipment, becoming, and still remaining, a world leader in humane animal killing. This resulted from a history of manufacturing and engineering by the Shelvokes, which includes: * 1876: James Shelvoke, Weaver; mail maker at Talford Street Works in Aston (Hulley's Directory). * 1890: George & James Shelvoke, Weavers; mail makers at Talford Street (Kelley's Directory). * 1896: C. Shelvoke & Co. was making pins, rings and chains at Talford Street (Peck's Circular). * 1896: James Shelvoke was making cycle chains, rivets, washers, and weavers' mails at Alma Street, Aston (Peck's Circular). The accountancy firm Shelvoke Pickering and Janney was established in Birmingham by Charles Hamilton Shelvoke, Harry's nephew, in about 1930. The Birmingham office was closed after a takeover, but the Cannock branch survives. Private life His home in Pixmore Way, Letchworth, was a mock-Tudor house built for him, named Melverley, where he lived until his death, surrounded by armour and swords. Similarly, the boardroom at the works, in Icknield Way, was wood panelled to resemble a baronial hall. Mr. Shelvoke apparently drove the ex-Prince of Wales' Daimler Double Six motor car. He is represented as \\"a fearsome gentleman of the old school, with a flair for showmanship. He expected high standards from his employees, but many remained loyal to the company over many years.\\" Harry usurped the coat of arms of the Thornes family of Shelvock and Melverley in Shropshire. He also celebrated his supposed family connection to the Shropshire privateer and pirate George Shelvocke (c. 1675-1742), who inspired Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner poem. Ancestry and loss of surname He is descended from those associated with Shelvock Manor in Shropshire and families bearing the name of Shelvock. Historical records show that the spelling variant of Shelvoke is first recorded in 1722 at Eccleshall in Staffordshire, NW of Stafford, before recurring in the 19th-century industrialised West Midlands towns of Wolverhampton and Willenhall, probable ancestors of Harry. James Shelvoke (originally Shilvock), Harry's grandfather, (born by 1814, location unknown) headed the family centred in nearby West Bromwich and Aston, part of Birmingham. James married Catharine Harper in Aston in 1833. They had three children: * James (c. 1834-1922/23; m. 1854 Sarah Rooke (1834-1875/76); children: Mary Ann (1857), Elizabeth (1859-1951), Florence (1867-1917/18), & Kate (1870-1939/40)) - a long-extinct line. * George (1836-1906/07; m. 1862 Emma Showell (1844-1920/21); children: Annie (1868), Charles (1870-1945), George Edwin (1874-1962), & Harry (1877-1962)). They were living in Trinity Road, Handsworth in 1881 and Shenstone in 1901. Emma died at Kingsbury Road, Birmingham. * Mary Ann (1837). George Edwin Shelvoke, Harry's brother, married Charlotte Theodora Feeney (1873-1934), and had Gwyneth Grace (1899-1966, born in Cape Colony, South Africa), and William George (1907-1985, m. 1968 Edythe Diana Thorpe (b. 1920)). In 1935, after Charlotte's death, he married May Wilhelmine Turner (1907-1991). Harry Shelvoke had a second cousin named Harry Clifford Shelvoke (1874-1927), who became a part of two families that settled in the Croydon area, south of London, in the early 20th century. Harry C's father was also Harry (born Henry) (1848/49-1929), and moved to Croydon. Harry C married there in 1902 and had three daughters: (Dorothy Edna (1903), Lilian Brenda (1906), and Eileen Norah (1908/09)). These girls married in 1929, 1931 and 1937 respectively, which ended the Shelvoke name for Harry C's line. His brother Frank also married in Croydon, in 1911, and had one daughter, Barbara Mary (1914-1996/97); she was the last Shelvoke born. Another line of Shelvokes likewise died out in the Wolverhampton area in the 19th century. Harry's nephews Charles Hamilton Shelvoke (1902-1955) and William George Shelvoke (1907-1985) produced no offspring. William died in Devon, leaving his widow as the sole surviving Shelvoke in name. Mrs Edythe Diana Shelvoke, born in 1920, died in 2019. A genetic tendency towards more girls than boys, combined with several males having no children, are the causes of the rareness and then extinction of the family name. Since 1901, about 200,000 surnames have disappeared altogether from England and Wales, according to a study conducted by Ancestry.co.uk.

Phillips concentrated on the large plantations that dominated the Southern economy, and he did not investigate the numerous small farmers who held few slaves. He concluded that plantation slavery produced great wealth, but was a dead end, economically, that left the South bypassed by the industrial revolution underway in the North. Phillips concluded that plantation slavery was not very profitable, had about reached its geographical limits in 1860, and would probably have faded away without the American Civil War, which he considered needless conflict. He praised the entrepreneurship of plantation owners and denied they were brutal. Phillips argued that they provided adequate food, clothing, housing, medical care and training in modern technology—that they formed a \\"school\\" which helped \\"civilize\\" the slaves. He admitted the failure was that no one graduated from this school. Phillips systematically hunted down and revealed plantation records and unused manuscript sources. An example of pioneering comparative work was \\"A Jamaica Slave Plantation\\" (1914). His methods and use of sources shaped the research agenda of most succeeding scholars, even those who disagreed with his favorable treatment of the masters.Peter J. Parish, Slavery: history and historians (1990) p. 6 After the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s historians turned their focus away from his emphasis on the material well-being of the slaves to the slaves' own cultural constructs and efforts to achieve freedom.Parish, p. 8 By turning away from the political debates about slavery that divided North and South, Phillips made the economics and social structure of slavery the main theme in 20th century scholarship. Together with his highly eloquent writing style, his new approach made him the most influential historian of the antebellum south. Biography He was born on November 4, 1877, in LaGrange, Georgia; his parents were Alonzo R. and Jessie Young Phillips. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Georgia in 1897. He obtained his Master of Arts degree from UGA as well in 1899 and his Ph.D. in 1902 from Columbia University where he studied under William Dunning. His dissertation, Georgia and State Rights won the Justin Winsor Prize in 1901 and was published by the American Historical Association.Georgia Encyclopedia article on Phillips by historian John David Smith at North Carolina State University, Raleigh Phillips was especially influenced by Frederick Jackson Turner who invited Phillips to the University of Wisconsin where Phillips taught from 1902 to 1908. He taught for three years at Tulane University. In 1911, Phillips moved to the University of Michigan where he taught until 1929 when he left to teach at Yale as Professor of American History until his death in 1934. In the 1920s he spent a year in Africa traveling and doing research. He received an honorary D. Litt. from Columbia University in 1929. He married Lucil Mayo-Smith on February 22, 1911, and had three children: Ulrich, Mabel, and Worthington. Historiography Some of Phillips's views were rejected in the 1950s, but they were revived again in the 1960s. As Harvard Sitkoff wrote in 1986, \\"[I]n the mid-1960s Eugene D. Genovese launched a rehabilitation of Phillips that still continues. Today, as in Phillips's lifetime, scholars again commonly acknowledge the value of many of his insights into the nature of the southern class structure and master-slave relationships.\\"Sitkoff review of Dillon, \\"Ulrich Bonnell Phillips\\" in The Journal of American History, 73#3 (Dec., 1986), p. 780. The Phillips school asked, what did slavery do for the slaves? As the historian Herbert Gutman noted, the Phillipsian answer was that slavery lifted the slaves out of the barbarism of Africa, Christianized them, protected them, and generally benefited them. Scholarship in the 1950s then moved to the question, what did slavery do to the slaves, and concluded it was a harsh and profitable system. More recently, scholars such as Genovese and Gutman asked, \\"What did slaves do for themselves?\\" They concluded \\"In the slave quarters, through family, community and religion, slaves struggled for a measure of independence and dignity.American Social History Project, City University of New York, \\"Who Built America? series\\" ; Herbert Gutman, The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom 1750–1925, (1977) p. 25, said \\"Critics, including such able scholars as E. Franklin Frazier, Kenneth M. Stampp, and Stanley M. Elkins, sharply rejected the racial assumptions of Phillips and his followers but focused on the same question.\\" Phillips concluded slavery was inefficient Phillips argued that large-scale plantation slavery was inefficient and not progressive. It had reached its geographical limits by 1860 or so, and eventually had to fade away (as happened in Brazil). In 1910, he argued in \\"The Decadence of the Plantation System\\" that slavery was an unprofitable relic that persisted because it produced social status, honor, and political power, that is, Slave Power. Phillips' economic conclusions about the inefficiency of slavery were challenged by Alfred H. Conrad and John R. Meyer, and Robert Fogel in the 1950s and 1960s, who argued that slavery was both efficient and profitable as long as the price of cotton was high enough. In turn Fogel came under sharp attack by other scholars. An essay by the historians George M. Fredrickson and Christopher Lasch (1967) analyzed limitations of both Phillips and his critics. They argued that far too much attention was given to slave \\"treatment\\" in examining the social and psychological effects of slavery on Afro-Americans. They said Phillips had defined the treatment issue and his most severe critics had failed to redefine it: > By compiling instances of the kindness and benevolence of masters, Phillips > proved to his satisfaction that slavery was a mild and permissive > institution, the primary function of which was not so much to produce a > marketable surplus as to ease the accommodation of the lower race into the > culture of the higher. The critics of Phillips have tried to meet him on his > own ground. Where he compiled lists of indulgences and benefactions, they > have assembled lists of atrocities. Both methods suffer from the same > defect: they attempt to solve a conceptual problem—what did slavery do to > the slave?—by accumulating quantitative evidence....

Biases John David Smith of North Carolina State University argues:New Georgia Encyclopedia: Ulrich Bonnell Phillips (1877-1934) > [He was] a conservative, proslavery interpreter of slavery and the slaves > ...

His views were rejected most sharply by Kenneth M. Stampp in the 1950s.In 1982, Stampp wrote, \\"In their day the writings of Ulrich B. Phillips on slavery were both highly original and decidedly revisionist... . He was about as objective as the rest of us.\\" Cited in Smith and Inscoe, p. 10 However, to a large degree Phillips' interpretive model of the dynamic between master and slave was revived by Eugene Genovese, who wrote that Phillips's \\"work, taken as a whole, remains the best and most subtle introduction to antebellum Southern history and especially to the problems posed by race and class.\\"Genovese, In Red and Black: Marxian Explorations in Southern and Afro-American History (1971) 275-76 In 1963, C. Vann Woodward wrote: \\"Much of what Phillips wrote has not been superseded or seriously challenged and remains indispensable.\\"Woodward, \\"Introduction\\" to 1963 edition of Life and Labor in the Old South page v. Phillips denied he was proslavery. He was an intellectual leader of the Progressive Movement and slavery, in his interpretation, was inefficient and antithetical to the principles of progressivism. Phillips (1910) explained in detail why slavery was a failed system. It is Smith's opinion that:Smith and Inscoe 1990 p. 10 > Phillips's contributions to the study of slavery clearly outweigh his > deficiencies. Neither saint nor sinner, he was subject to the same forces-- > bias, selectivity of evidence, inaccuracy--that plague us all. Descended > from slave owners and reared in the rural South, he dominated slave > historiography in an era when Progressivism was literally for whites only. > Of all scholars, historians can ill afford to be anachronistic. Phillips was > no more a believer in white supremacy than other leading contemporary white > scholars. Race as \\"central theme\\" of southern U.S. history In \\"The Central Theme of Southern History\\" (1928), Phillips maintained that the desire to keep their region \\"a white man's country\\" united the white southerners for centuries. Phillips' emphasis on race was overshadowed in the late 1920s and 1930s by the Beardian interpretation of Charles A. Beard and Mary Ritter Beard, who in their enormously successful The Rise of American Civilization (1927) emphasized class conflict and downplayed slavery and race relations as a cause of the American Civil War. By the 1950s, however, the Beardian economic determinism was out of fashion, and the emphasis on race (rather than region or class) became a major topic in historiography.Darden Asbury Pyron, \\"U.B. Phillips: Biography and Scholarship,\\" Reviews in American History 1987 15(1): 72-77; Thomas Pressley, American Interpret their Civil War 238ff on Beard, 278ff on Phillips. W.H. Stephenson wrote in 1955, \\"Historically speaking, Phillips's central theme of southern history was correct, for white southerners from colonial days to the twentieth century advocated white supremacy.\\" Stephenson in Smith and Inscoe, p. 28. On the revival of interest in Phillips's \\"central theme,\\" see Robert E. Shalhope, \\"Race, Class, Slavery, and the Antebellum Southern Mind,\\" Journal of Southern History 37 (November 1971), 557–574 and James M. McPherson, \\"Slavery and Race,\\" in Perspectives on American History 3 (1969), 460–473. By 2000, Jane Dailey, Glenda Gilmore, and Bryant Simon argue by citing Phillips:\\"Introduction\\" in Jane Dailey, Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore, and Bryant Simon, eds. Jumpin' Jim Crow: Southern Politics from Civil War to Civil Rights (2000), online excerpt. > The ways in which white southerners \\"met\\" the race \\"problem\\" have intrigued > historians writing about post-Civil War southern politics since at least > 1928, when Ulrich B.

In his review of Complicity: How the North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery by Anne Farrow, Joel Lang and Jenifer Frank, the historian Ira Berlin wrote, \\"Slavery in the North, like its counterpart in the South, was a brutal, violent relationship that fostered white supremacy. Complicity's authors shred the notion, famously advanced by the Yale historian U.B. Phillips, that the central theme of Southern history was the region's desire to remain a white man's country. Phillips was not so much wrong about the centrality of white supremacy to the South as blind to its presence in the North.\\"Ira Berlin, \\"The Battle Over Memory\\" Washington Post Book World February 12, 2006; page BW10 Works For a comprehensive annotated guide see Fred Landon and Everett E.

Early English law In English law, it was an offence both at common law and by statute, punishable by fine and imprisonment. As a statutory offence it dates back to 1360. The offence is complete, whether any verdict has been given or not, and whether the verdict is in accordance with the weight of evidence or otherwise. The person making the attempt, and any member of the jury who consents, are equally punishable. The legal term \\"embracery\\" comes from the Old Fr. embraseour, an embracer, i.e., one who excites or instigates, literally one who sets on fire, from embraser, to kindle a fire. This is unrelated to the common word \\"embrace\\", i.e., to hold or clasp in the arms, which is from French embracer, from Latin bracchia, arms. The false verdict of a jury, whether occasioned by embracery or otherwise, was formerly considered criminal, and jurors were severely punished, being proceeded against by writ of attaint. The Juries Act 1825, in abolishing writs of attaint, made a special exemption as regards jurors guilty of embracery (s.61). Prosecution for the offence has been so extremely rare that when a case occurred in 1891R v Baker 113, Cent. Crim. Ct. Sess. Pap. 374 it was stated that no precedent could be found for the indictment. The defendant was fined £200, afterwards reduced to £100. Modern usage By 2010 the offence was regarded as obsolete, 28-47, 28-151 and such misconduct more likely to be charged as perverting the course of justice.Attorney-General v. Judd [1995] COD 15, DC The last conviction for embracery in the UK was at Caernarvon Crown Court in November 1975 but it was quashed by the Court of Appeal the following year on the initiative of Lord Justice Lawton,R v. Owen [1976] 3 All ER 239 who said that the offence was obsolete. The offence was abolished by section 17 of the Bribery Act 2010,Bribery Act 2010 on legislation.gov.uk. as from 1 July 2011.Bribery Act 2010 (Commencement) Order 2011, SI 2011 No. 1418 In the United States, embracery prosecutions have occurred as recently as 1989, when a county commissioner in Georgia was sentenced to a fine and probation.Calhoun Times. \\"Embracery Case Politically Motivated, Sutherland Says\\". 8 June 1988, pp. 1A, 2A.

This chapel is dedicated to Louis XVI and his wife, Marie Antoinette, although they are formally buried in the Basilica of St Denis. The closest métro station is Saint-Augustin 15px 15px. History and construction The chapel was designed in 1816 by the French Neo-Classical architect Pierre François Léonard Fontaine, who, with his partner Charles Percier, figured among Napoleon's favourite architects. Fontaine's assistant Louis-Hippolyte Lebas oversaw the construction. The chapel was partly constructed on the grounds of the former Madeleine Cemetery, where King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette had been buried after they had been guillotined. King Louis XVIII shared the 3 million livres expense of building the Chapelle expiatoire with the Duchess of Angoulême. Construction took ten years, and the chapel was inaugurated in 1826 in the presence of King Charles X. When he blessed the cornerstone of the Chapelle expiatoire, Hyacinthe-Louis de Quelen, Archbishop of Paris, called in vain for an amnesty of the exiled members of the National Convention. Building and courtyard Louis XVI Called to Immortality, Sustained by an Angel, by François Joseph Bosio The Chapelle expiatoire stands on a slight rise. There are two buildings separated by a courtyard which is surrounded by an enclosed cloister-like precinct, a peristyle, that isolates the chapel from the outside world. The building on Rue Pasquier is the entrance. There is an inscription above the entrance, which reads (translated): In the courtyard are cenotaphs to those who were known to be buried in this location. The chapel itself is entered through a pedimented tetrastyle portico, of a sombre Doric order. It contains a domed space at the center of a Greek cross, formed by three coffered half-domed apses with oculi that supplement the subdued natural light entering through the skylight of the main dome. The cubic, semicylindrical and hemispheric volumes recall the central planning of High Renaissance churches as much as they do a Greco-Roman martyrium. White marble sculptures of the king and queen in ecstatic attitudes were made by François Joseph Bosio and Jean-Pierre Cortot. There is also a bas-relief by French sculptor François-Antoine Gérard (who also did some of the other carvings) showing the exhumation and removal of the remains of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette to the Basilica of St Denis. The crypt contains a black and white marble altar intended to mark the place where the royal remains were found. The Chapelle expiatoire is without doubt the most uncompromising late neoclassical religious building of Paris. Chateaubriand found it \\"the most remarkable edifice in Paris\\". The chapel's severe geometry is unrelieved by sculpture, as can be seen by the view from rue d'Anjou. Later history In 1862, the cypresses which surrounded the chapel were cut down, and a public park (Square Louis XVI) was created around the complex. In May 1871 The Commune demanded that the Chapel be torn down. This was never put into effect. Every January 21, a memorial mass is held in the chapel to commemorate the death of Louis XVI. The Chapel was severely damaged by storm in 2009.

However, combat service support is often more limited in depth, as the related groups primarily address factors supporting readiness for combat operations. The United States Department of Defense organizes various agencies providing services such as medical assistance, for example, akin to other nations' militaries. United States Army In the United States Army, the term combat service support was until 2008 defined as the essential capabilities, functions, activities, and tasks necessary to sustain all elements of operating forces in theater at all levels of war. Within the national and theater logistics systems, it includes but is not limited to that support rendered by service forces in ensuring the aspects of materiel and supply chain management, maintenance, transportation, health services, and other services required by aviation and ground combat troops to permit those units to accomplish their missions in combat. Combat service support encompasses those activities at all levels of war that produce sustainment to all operating forces on the battlefield. Within the United States Army, the traditional combat service support branches are the following: Basic branches * Acquisition Corps * Adjutant General's Corps * Finance Corps * Logistics Corps * Ordnance Corps * Quartermaster Corps * Transportation Corps Special branches * Army Medical Department (AMEDD) ** Dental Corps ** Medical Corps ** Medical Service Corps ** Medical Specialist Corps ** Nurse Corps ** Veterinary Corps * Chaplain Corps * Judge Advocate General's Corps =Replaced by sustainment= \\"Combat service support\\" as a classification was replaced by \\"sustainment\\" with the publication of FM 3–0, Operations in February 2008. Sustainment is one of the six warfighting functions, which also include movement and maneuver, intelligence, fires, command and control, and protection. United States Marine Corps In the United States Marine Corps, combat service support has a similar definition to that of the United States Army. The Marine Corps Logistics Command (MARCORLOGCOM) is the preferred provider of supply chain management, collaborative maintenance management and strategic prepositioning to the operating forces of the United States Marine Corps and other services and agencies. The Logistics Combat Element (LCE), formerly Combat Service Support Element (CSSE) is the portion of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) responsible for providing logistical support. The LCE provides all support functions not organic to the ground combat element (GCE) and aviation combat element (ACE) units of the MAGTF. Functions include: heavy engineer support, motor transport, supply, maintenance, medical, dental, and specialized support such as air delivery, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), and landing support. =Logistics groups= There are four logistics groups in the United States Marine Corps: * 1st Marine Logistics Group, based at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California, provides tactical logistics support above the organic capabilities of supported elements of the I Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) and provides task organized Logistics Combat Elements in support of MAGTF operations.

Colin Bateman, the one-time Daily Express cricket correspondent, noted, \\"Peter Richardson was one of cricket's great characters...off the field he was a one-man entertainment show, particularly when the troops were stuck in some up-country billet in India. His sense of humour and sharp mind enlivened many a dull official function to the delight of his team-mates. His love of a prank continued after his playing days with outrageous letters from fictitious Colonel Blimps to The Daily Telegraph.\\" Life and career A left-handed opening batsman, Richardson played as an amateur for Worcestershire and was a near-instant success on his arrival as a regular in the side in 1952. Four years later, he had a similarly quick impact in his first Test series, the 1956 Ashes series, scoring 81 and 73 in his first match, and following it up with 104 at Old Trafford in a match famous for Jim Laker's 19 wickets. He went on to score 491 Test runs that year, the most in the world. He was first choice opening batsman for England for a further two home series, but then had a poor series in Australia in 1958–59, when England lost the Ashes comprehensively. He was voted one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1957. In the summer of 1958, Richardson announced that he wanted to become a professional and to move to Kent. Worcestershire opposed the move, and Richardson was effectively barred from competitive cricket during the English 1959 season, losing his Test place too while he waited to qualify for his new county. By the time he resumed his county career in 1960 other left-handed opening batsmen, such as Geoff Pullar and Raman Subba Row, had moved ahead of him in the competition for England places. Richardson played on for Kent until his retirement from cricket in 1965. He toured Pakistan and India in 1961–62, mostly batting down the order, but played only one further Test match in England, in 1963 against the West Indies, when he made only 2 and 14 against a bowling attack spearheaded by Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith. Richardson's two brothers also played first-class cricket. Dick Richardson was a middle-order batsman for Worcestershire who played one Test for England against the West Indies in 1957, playing alongside his brother, \\"the first time... [in the 20th century] of siblings appearing in the same team for England\\". His other brother, Bryan, was an occasional player for Warwickshire. Richardson died on 17 February 2017, aged 85.

When this worship was introduced into Boeotia, the names of the mountains, grots, and springs with which this poetic religion was connected, were transferred from the North to the South. The boundaries which historians and geographers give to this province vary. In the systematic geography of Ptolemy the name is given to the extent of coast between the mouths of the Ludias and the Haliacmon rivers. Pieria was bounded on the West from the contiguous district of the Thessalian Perrhaebia by the great chain of Olympus. An offshoot from Olympus advances along the Pierian plain, in a North-west direction, as far as the ravine of the Haliacmon, where the mountains are separated by that chasm in the great eastern ridge of Northern Greece from the portion of it anciently called Bermius. The highest summit of the Pierian range called Pierus Mons and is a conspicuous object in all the country to the East. It would seem that there was a city called Pieria, which may be represented by a tumulus, overgrown with trees upon the extremity of the ridge of Andreotissa, where it ends in a point between Dium and Pydna, the other two chief cities of Pieria. Beyond Pydna was a considerable forest, called Pieria Silva, which may have furnished the Pierian pitch, which had such a high reputation. The road from Pella to Larissa in Thessaly passed through Pieria, and was probably the route which the consul Quintus Marcius Philippus pursued in the third and fourth years of the third Macedonian War (171 BC-168 BC).

Her parents Pierre Napoleon Berger, a grocery clerk, and Marie Alphonse Foisy were both of French-Canadian ancestry. Convent educated in the United States and Canada, in 1905 she began to work as an artist and lived with her brother Henry in Manhattan, along with his wife and three children. On November of the same year, she married George K. Hollister who a few years later became a pioneer cinematographer with Kalem Studios in New York City. When Kalem Studios began sending a film crew to Florida in the wintertime, Alice Hollister accompanied her husband. She began appearing in film in 1910, at first because of the small crew and the frequent need for a female in a bit part. However, she liked acting and went on to appear in many films, the last in 1925. One of Hollister's most important roles was that of Mary Magdalene in the film From the Manger to the Cross (1912). Filmed on location in Palestine, this film has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. The Vampire (1913) made her the first recognized vamp in cinema, predating Theda Bara in A Fool There Was (1915).Robert K. Klepper, Silent Films, 1877–1996: A Critical Guide to 646 Movies, McFarland, 2005, p.63 For that role, she was dubbed \\"the original vampire\\". She reprised the vamp character in The Lotus Woman (1916), her last film for Kalem. In her later career, she mainly appeared in supporting roles. Her husband died in 1952 and she died in 1973, aged 86, in Costa Mesa, California. She was affected by dementia and vision loss in her old age. They are interred together in the Great Mausoleum, Columbarium of Solace at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Personal life Alice and George K. Hollister had a daughter, Doris Ethel (1906–1990), and a son, George Jr. (1908–1976), both child actors. Doris married cartoonist Walter Lantz in 1930 but divorced several years later. George Jr. would later embark on a photography career.

Location SMUS is located in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada on the southern tip of Vancouver Island. The Senior and Middle School campus is located on Richmond Road in Saanich. The Junior School campus is situated on Victoria Avenue in Oak Bay. History In 1906, University School was founded by Cap. R. V. Harvey, the Rev. W. W. Bolton and J. C. Barnacle. Four years later, in 1910, K. C. Symons founded St. Michael's School. St. Michael's School was unusual for its relatively large number of local day students for the period (as contrasted with University School's large number of boarders). Facing financial difficulties and the death of its headmaster in 1970, University School merged with St. Michael's in 1971 to become St Michaels University School. In 1973, the school began to enrol grade 1 and 2 students for the first time. In 1978, girls were accepted as day and boarding students in grades 10–12 for the first time, and the school began the process of becoming fully coeducational in 1985. A major expansion of the campus also began in 1985. In 1993, SMUS's boarding houses were renamed after the school's six founders: Bolton, Harvey, Winslow, Timmis, Symons, and Barnacle.

While the holiday is normally celebrated on April 2nd, it can fall on any date between the latter parts of March and the first week of April, depending on the day of the week April 2nd falls on and/or the Governor's discretion. Pascua Florida Day is a State Holiday. Background Flowers in Florida Juan Ponce de Leon is the first known European to discover the area that is now known as Florida. His successful discovery of Puerto Rico during one of many Spanish expeditions for gold, mystical items and new lands, precipitated Spain's permission and encouragement to claim more lands in the new world. One such mystical item that lured him to what eventually happened to be Florida, was the Fountain of Youth. Juan Ponce de Leon became governor of Puerto Rico during the early 1500s.The natives told him of an island that was rich in gold and had a magical fountain of water which would renew a person's health and youth. Intrigued, Ponce de Leon returned to Spain to seek the approval of the Spanish crown to search and explore the island, known by natives as Bimini. On February 23 of 1512, King Ferdinand approved Ponce de Leon's request to search for the island and by the 3rd of March in 1513, three ships left the Port of San German in Puerto Rico to search for the island of Bimini. He landed on Floridian shores some time during April 2 to April 8 and named the area \\"la Florida\\" in honor of \\"Pascua Florida\\", Spain's Easter time celebration,because of the vast expanse of floral plants he encountered. The expedition believed their discovery to be a large island and Ponce de Leon named the 'island' Pascua Florida. History of HolidayHistory and Significance= Pascua Florida Day commemorates the arrival of Juan Ponce de Leon on the shores of the state of Florida in 1513. Florida is now known as the \\"Flower State\\" because of the connection to Ponce de Leon and Pascua Florida. Since its entry into legislature, the holiday, while having no specific celebratory acts, usually culminates in a period of retrospection of Florida's rich history and the preceding events that led to it. =Celebration= Pascua Florida Day is only celebrated in Florida. The holiday was adopted into Florida law on April 2 of 1953 at the suggestion of Mary A. Harrell, a Social Studies teacher in Jacksonville, Florida. From that point on, the week within which the holiday falls, usually March 27 to April 2, is dubbed Pascua Florida Week to honor Florida's history, and school children and adults alike, are urged to observe the time by partaking in commemorative exercises and programs. =Pascua Florida Day= Pascua Florida Day is usually celebrated on April 2 (the day on which Ponce de León first spotted Florida) unless it falls on a weekend, in which case the governor may declare either the preceding Friday or the following Monday as the state day.

Smith, CQ (born April 28, 1951) is an athlete, businessperson and member of the Senate of Canada. He served as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from April 2017 until November 2019. Education He graduated from Bishop's University with a degree in economics. Smith was the first overall selection of the 1972 CFL Draft and went on to play nine seasons in the Canadian Football League, all of them as a running back with the Montreal Alouettes. Smith earned a Bachelor of Civil Law from McGill University in 1976, having undertaken his studies for law while playing pro football. Football management career Smith became the Canadian Football League's eighth commissioner in 1992 and oversaw the league's ill-fated attempt to expand to the United States. Smith then oversaw the re-location of the Baltimore Stallions to Montreal, where they became the Montreal Alouettes for the CFL's 1996 season. After resigning as commissioner in 1997, Smith served as president of the Alouettes until 2001 and again from 2004 to 2010. Business career He was president and publisher of the Montreal Gazette newspaper from 2002 to 2004. He has also held positions with Industrial Life Technical Services, John Labatt, Ltd., and Ogilvie Mills, Ltd. Political career He considered running for leader of the then new Conservative Party of Canada in 2004 and was widely reported by Canadian press at the time to be on the verge of entering the race before finally announcing he would not be a candidate. On December 18, 2010, he was summoned to the Canadian Senate on the advice of Prime Minister Stephen Harper and sat as a Conservative. Following his appointment to the Senate, Smith announced his intention to seek the nomination to run as a Conservative candidate in Lac-Saint-Louis in the next federal election. When asked in a television interview why he accepted the appointment while intending to run for a Commons seat, Smith complained that he was taking a \\"dramatic, catastrophic\\" pay cut by serving as a senator, a remark for which Smith has been criticized. Smith was defeated in his attempt to enter Parliament, placing third behind the incumbent Liberal MP and the NDP candidate, and it was announced on May 18, 2011, he would be re-appointed to the Senate. The Conservative Senate Caucus elected Smith its leader on March 28, 2017; Smith defeated Senators Linda Frum and Stephen Greene for the position, and took office on April 1, 2017. Personal life Smith has three children, two sons and a daughter. One of his sons, Bradley, is a former receiver for the Toronto Argonauts and the Edmonton Eskimos, while his daughter, Ashley, was formerly married to CFL placekicker and punter Damon Duval.

It is comparable to Hooah in the United States Army and the United States Air Force, and Hooyah in the United States Navy and the United States Coast Guard. Origins There are several potential sources from which the word \\"oorah\\" originated. * Turkic/Mongolian: ** The term may have been derived from the Ottoman Turkish phrase \\"vur ha\\" translated as \\"strike\\" or the Mongolian word \\"urakh\\" meaning \\"forward\\". It was used as a battle cry of the Ottoman Empire army and adapted as a Russian battle cry \\"ura\\". ** According to Jean Paul Roux the word \\"Hurrah\\" comes from Old Turkic, in use until medieval times. In his book, History of Turks he states: \\"For example, while attacking to their enemies, they (Turks) used to shout \\"Ur Ah!\\" which means \\"Come on, hit!\\" (in modern Turkish \\"Vur Hadi!\\") Then this exclamation turned into \\"Hurrah!\\" in [the] West... The difference represents diachronic change in the phonology and verbal usage in Turkish. The verb for \\"to hit\\" or \\"to strike\\" was urmak, which became vurmak in Modern Turkish. Moreover, a former subjunctive imperative verbal ending of e/a is not productive in Modern Turkish. Therefore, \\"ura\\", meaning \\"may it hit\\", which would have changed phonetically to \\"vura\\" in Modern Turkish, is expressed with \\"vursun\\". ** The term may have come from warriors of Ancient Hun or of Mongolian Empire \\"hurray\\" meaning \\"to move attack\\" or \\"appeal for goodness\\", which was formed into \\"(h)urra\\" in Russian with same meaning, and from which the Mongolia \\"Uria\\" (callings or slogans) comes from. \\"Hurray and Uria\\" words are used today in Mongolia from the ancient soldiers. ** Jack Weatherford asserts that it comes from the Mongolian \\"hurree\\", used by Mongol armies and spread throughout the world during the Mongol Empire of the 13th century, but he does not appear to present any supporting evidence. Weatherford says that in Mongolian \\"hurree\\" is a sacred praise much like amen or hallelujah. * Germanic: ** The term may have come from Middle High German of 1580–1590 \\"hurren\\" meaning \\"to move fast\\", which was formed into \\"hurra\\" and from which the English \\"hurry\\" comes. It is still used in the Netherlands during celebrations in the form of \\"hoera\\", as well as in Sweden, Norway and Denmark as \\"hurra\\". * The term may be a variation of 18th century sailors exclamation \\"huzzah\\", traditionally said during salutes. * In World War II injured US Marines were treated in northern Australia. The term 'Ooh Rah' is said to be local slang for 'farewell' or 'until then', although it is likely to be a mishearing of the more common 'ooroo'. * The 1st Amphibious Reconnaissance Company, FMFPAC can be credited with the introduction of \\"Ooh-rah!\\" into the Marine Corps in 1953, shortly after the Korean War. Recon Marines served aboard the USS Perch (ASSP-313), a WWII–era diesel submarine retrofitted to carry Navy Underwater Demolition Teams and Recon Marines. Whenever the boat was to dive, the 1MC (PA system) would announce \\"DIVE! DIVE!\\", followed by the sound of the diving klaxon: \\"AHUGA!\\" In 1953 or 1954, while on a conditioning run, former Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps John R. Massaro, while serving as company Gunnery Sergeant of 1st Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion, simulated the \\"Dive\\" horn sound \\"AHUGA!\\" as part of the cadence. Legend has it, he took it with him when he went to serve as an instructor at the Drill Instructor school at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego. He there passed it on to the Drill Instructor students and they, in turn, passed it on to their recruits where it eventually and naturally became a part of the Recon cadence, and thereafter infiltrated Recon Marine lexicon. Over time, \\"AHUGA!\\" morphed into the shorter, simpler \\"Ooh Rah!\\" Today, the official Marine Corps Training Reference Manual on the history of Marine Recon is titled \\"AHUGA!\\" Other uses * \\"Hoorah\\" is also used by United States Navy Hospital Corpsmen, Masters-at-Arms, and Seabees because of their close association with the Marine Corps. * \\"Urra\\" or \\"Hura\\", often mistaken for \\"Ura\\", is the battle cry of the Russian Armed Forces, as well the Soviet Armed Forces and Red Army that preceded it. Its usage dates back to the Medieval era, derived from the Mongolian phrase hurray, meaning \\"to move\\" or \\"to attack\\". Mostly used during World War II, it is still used during military parades and Victory Day celebrations by all branches of the Russian military as well as most armed forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States and in the Bulgarian Armed Forces. It was and is also used as a patriotic phrase denoting respect to the military as well as the country itself. * \\"Rah\\" is a shortened form of the word, typically said in greeting or in agreement, used in a more casual tone. * \\"Vashaa\\" (ვაშა) is the Georgian language version of the Soviet-era \\"Ura\\" that is used by personnel of the Defense Forces of Georgia during official parades.

The complete anime series, including the movie, were broadcast by the anime television network, Animax, across its respective networks around the world, including East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia and other regions. Overview In the distant future people no longer drive cars themselves, instead relying on AI (artificial intelligence) computers to drive their cars for them. But when these AI systems start losing control and running wild somebody has to stop them. éX-Drivers are the people who are able to operate the older mechanical non-AI dependent cars who chase down the AI cars and stop them. A good amount of future and near future technology is featured throughout the series, including automated highway systems and A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) technology. Automated highway systems have been proposed as a solution to the traffic congestion problems. In the series, anybody, regardless of age, can be an éX-Driver as long as they possess the required skills. For example, one of the main characters is only 13 years old and drives. The premise of the show is that there are éX-Drivers all over the world but the focus is on the team operating in Japan. Cars used by éX-Drivers are marked with an éX-D decal. Typically an éX-Driver car would be an older mechanical type car and almost always would be rear-wheel drive with the exception of an AWD (4WD) Subaru Impreza WRC since éX-Drivers usually employ techniques such as drifting when bringing down runaway cars, which is much more difficult with front wheel drive (FWD) cars and in an all wheel drive (AWD) car. Characters ; :Japanese voice actor: Yoko Asada :English voice actor: Philece Sampler :Cantonese voice actor: Celina Lam :Lisa's éx-Driver partner.

He initially has a tense relationship with Lisa, but they begin to gain their trust as the series progresses. OVA The OVA series consists of 6 episodes which are - except the last two - independent from each other. # AI vs RECIPRO # On And On # No Problem # Regulations of Love (éX- Rider) # Crossroads # The Last Mile Movie The éX-Driver anime series was also adapted into an anime movie sequel, entitled éX-Driver The Movie, which follows the adventures of Lisa, Lorna and Souichi as they participate in an international éX-Driver race held at Los Angeles. The movie also consisted of a special prequel to the series, entitled, éX-Driver - Nina & Rei Danger Zone, which served as the prologue for the movie, centering on the adventures of two of the former éX-Drivers, Nina Thunder and Rei Kazama. Three short bonus shorts were also featured with the movie, featuring Lisa, Lorna and Souichi in events set just before where the movie takes off. These bonus shorts are done in comedic style, mainly with camera pans and zooms on still images: #Onsen—set in a hot spring #Race Queen—set in the éX-Driver Base #Airport—set in the Airport on their way to Los Angeles Staff *Planning, original creator, original character concept: Kōsuke Fujishima *Series composition and script: Shinjo Fujita *éX-Car design: Shunji Murata *Mecha design: Takeshi Takakura, Hidefumi Kimura (ep.1) *Music: JAM Project, Hikaru Nanase *Director: Jun Kawagoe External links  * Category:2000 anime OVAs Category:2002 anime films Category:Japanese films Category:2002 anime OVAs Category:Japanese auto racing films Category:Animated films about auto racing Category:Actas Category:Anime with original screenplays Category:Anime Works Category:Bandai Namco franchises Category:Geneon USA Category:Kōsuke Fujishima Category:Fictional motorsports in anime and manga Category:Science fiction anime and manga Category:Films directed by Akira Nishimori ","title":"ÉX-Driver"},{"id":"2718861","text":"A sensitivity speck is a place in silver halide crystal where latent image is preferentially formed. This is very often the site of shallow electron traps, such as crystalline defect (particularly edge dislocation) and silver sulfide specks created by sulfur sensitization process. When a photon is absorbed by a silver halide crystal, a free-carrier (electron in the conduction band) is generated. This free-carrier can migrate through the crystal lattice of silver halide, until captured by the shallow electron trap, where the electron is likely to reduce an interstitial silver ion to form an atomic silver. Subsequent exposure can grow the size of silver cluster through the same mechanism. This forms the latent image where the silver cluster becomes large enough to render the entire crystal developable in developer solution.

Both sites commemorate the efforts of Guglielmo Marconi to transmit transatlantic radio signals between North America and Europe in the first decade of the 20th century. The two sites are located within approximately of one another, and are connected by the Marconi Trail. Signal Hill in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador is another National Historic Site related to Marconi's work in Canada. Signal Hill was designated, in part, to commemorate Marconi's first transmission tests in 1901. Marconi National Historic Site A model of Marconi's transmission towers at his first wireless station in Glace Bay Marconi National Historic Site, located at Table Head in Glace Bay, is the site of Guglielmo Marconi's first transatlantic wireless station, callsign VAS, and the first wireless message sent from North America to Europe on December 15, 1902. The site features the remnants of Marconi's transmission towers, a modern amateur radio station, plus a museum chronicling Marconi's achievements. Marconi chose this site for its elevated flat expanse and unobstructed view out over the Atlantic Ocean. Some of the concrete footings for the massive towers can still be seen on the grounds. In 1901, the first west to east wireless message was sent across the Atlantic Ocean to England from this site. A spark gap transmitter with 75 kilowatts of power fed four tall antennas on the site overlooking the ocean. In December 1902 Marconi transmitted the first complete messages to Poldhu from stations at Glace Bay, Nova Scotia.Marconi Biography, Marconi Biography. Marconi's facilities were dismantled and moved to a larger site to the southwest in 1905, known today as the Marconi Wireless Station National Historic Site. The first Glace Bay site was designated a National Historic Site in 1939. The site a unit of the national park system, operated by Parks Canada, and the museum at the Marconi National Historic Site is affiliated with CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada. Marconi Wireless Station National Historic Site Communications between Glace Bay and England proved to be unreliable, and only possible after dark, so Marconi had larger stations constructed on both sides of the Atlantic between 1905 and 1907. These stations were at Clifden, Ireland, and a site just south of Glace Bay, near Port Morien. The two stations were at the time the most powerful radio stations in the world. The Marconi Wireless Station in Cape Breton ceased operations in 1946. The property was bought by Russell Cunningham, a local resident, and it is still owned by his heirs. All that remains of the station today is the foundations of the aerial towers as well as three abandoned buildings in varying degrees of repair. The site was designated a National Historic Site in 1983. It is not a unit of the national park system, and public access is only by permission of the owners.

DeSoto was a well-established brand that produced passenger cars and trucks for more than three decades in the United States. More than two million DeSoto vehicles were built for markets in North America. 1929–1942 1929 DeSoto, the first model year of DeSoto The DeSoto make was founded by Walter Chrysler on August 4, 1928, and introduced for the 1929 model year. It was named after the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto, who led the first European expedition deep into the territory of the modern-day United States (Florida, Georgia and Alabama) and was the first documented European to have crossed the Mississippi River. The DeSoto logo featured a stylized image of the explorer. Chrysler wanted to enter the brand in competition with Oldsmobile, Buick, Studebaker, Hudson and Willys in the mid-price class. DeSoto served as a lower-priced version of Chrysler products, with Dodge and Plymouth added to the Chrysler family in 1928. In the inaugural DeSoto model year of 1929, 81,065 cars were produced, a first-year record in the U.S. that lasted until the introduction of the 1960 Ford Falcon. However, shortly after the DeSoto was introduced, Chrysler completed its purchase of Dodge Brothers, giving the company two mid-priced makes. Initially, the two-make strategy was relatively successful, with DeSoto priced below Dodge models. Despite the economic times, DeSoto sales were relatively healthy, pacing Dodge at around 25,000 units in 1932. In 1933, Chrysler reversed the market positions of the two marques in hopes of boosting Dodge sales. The DeSoto received Chrysler's streamlined 1934 Airflow bodies, but on the shorter DeSoto wheelbase, the design was a disaster and was unpopular with consumers. Unlike Chrysler, which still had more traditional models on which to fall back, DeSoto was hobbled by the Airflow design until the 1935 Airstream arrived. Aside from its Airflow models, DeSoto's 1942 model is probably its second-most memorable model from the pre-war years, when the cars were fitted with powered pop-up headlights, a first for a North American mass-production vehicle. (The Cord 810 introduced dashboard hand-cranked hidden headlamps in the 1936 model year.) DeSoto marketed the feature as \\"Air-Foil\\" lights (\\"Out of Sight Except at Night\\"). =1929–1942 gallery= File:De Soto 4-Door Sedan 1932.jpg1932 De Soto 4-Door Sedan File:35 DeSoto Airflow SG Business Coupe (9346431804).jpg1935 DeSoto Airflow SG Business Coupe File:De Soto 4-Door Sedan 1938.jpg1938 De Soto 4-Door Sedan File:De Soto Custom Coupe 1941.jpg1941 De Soto Series S-8 Custom Coupé File:1942 DeSoto Custom (4148147080).jpg1942 De Soto convertible 1946–1960 1946 four-door After wartime restrictions on automotive production were ended, DeSoto returned to civilian car production when it reissued its 1942 models as 1946 models, but without the hidden-headlight feature, and with fender contours extending into the doors, like other Chrysler products of the immediate postwar period. Until 1952, DeSoto used the Deluxe and Custom model designations. In 1952, DeSoto added the Firedome with its 276-cid Hemi engine. However, in 1953, DeSoto dropped the Deluxe and Custom names and designated its six-cylinder cars the Powermaster and its V8 car remained the Firedome. At its height, DeSoto's more popular models included the Firesweep, Firedome and Fireflite. The DeSoto Adventurer, introduced for 1956 as a high-performance hard-top coupe (similar to Chrysler's 300), became a full-range model in 1960. In 1955,Flory, pp. 621 & 700. along with all Chrysler models, DeSotos were redesigned with Virgil Exner's \\"Forward Look.\\" DeSotos sold well through the 1956 model year. That year, for the first and only time in the marque's history, it served as pace car at the Indianapolis 500.Flory, p. 701. For the 1956 update, Exner gave the DeSoto soaring tailfins fitted with triple taillights, and consumers responded by buying in record numbers. The 1957 had a well-integrated design, with two variations: the smaller Firesweep body placed on the concurrent Dodge 122-inch wheelbase chassis with Dodge front fenders and the Firedome and Fireflite (and its halo model Adventurer sub-series), based on the larger 126-inch wheelbase chassis shared with Chrysler. As was conventional in the era, subsequent years within the typical three-year model block were distinguished by trim, bumper and other low-cost modifications, typically by adding bulk to bumpers and grilles, taillight changes, color choices, instrumentation and interior design changes and often additional external trim. The 1958 economic downturn hurt sales of mid-priced makes across the board, and DeSoto sales were 60% lower than those of 1957 in what would be DeSoto's worst year since 1938. Also, Ford Motor Company had introduced new mid-price competitors for the 1958 model year with the Edsel brand. The sales slide continued for 1959 and 1960 (down 40% from the already-low 1959 figures), and rumors began to circulate that DeSoto was soon to be discontinued. 1960 was the last year of DeSoto sales in Canada. =1946–1960 gallery= De Soto Club Coupe de 1948, Helsinki, Finlandia, 2012-08-14, DD 01.JPGDe Soto Club Coupe (1948) File:De Soto Custom 4-Door Sedan 1949.jpg 1949 Custom 4-door sedan File:1956 De Soto Firedome 2-door hardtop front.JPG1956 Firedome 2-door hardtop File:De Soto Coupe 1959.jpg1959 DeSoto Firedome 2-Door Sportsman File:1960 Desoto Adventurer, Belgian licence registration OBF-886 p13.JPG1960 DeSoto Adventurer 1961 1961 – the final DeSoto model year By the time the 1961 DeSoto was introduced in the fall of 1960, rumors were widespread that Chrysler was moving toward terminating the brand, fueled by a reduction in model offerings for the 1960 model year. The introduction of the lower-priced Newport to the upscale Chrysler brand no doubt hastened the decision to end production of the DeSoto, which was very similar in size, styling, price and standard features. For 1961, DeSoto lost its series designations entirely, in a move reminiscent of Packard's final lineup. And, as with the final Packards, the final DeSoto was of questionable design merit. Again based on the shorter Chrysler Windsor wheelbase, the DeSoto featured a two-tiered grille (each tier with a different texture) and revised taillights. Only a two-door hardtop and a four-door hardtop were offered. The cars were trimmed similarly to the 1960 Fireflite. The final decision to discontinue DeSoto was announced on November 18, 1960, just 47 days after the 1961 models were introduced. At the time, Chrysler warehouses contained several million dollars in 1961 DeSoto parts, so the company ramped up production in order to use up the stock. The last DeSoto rolled off the line on November 30. Chrysler and Plymouth dealers, which had been forced to take possession of DeSotos under the terms of their franchise agreements, received no compensation from Chrysler for their unsold DeSotos at the time of the formal announcement. Making matters worse, Chrysler continued to ship the cars through December, many of which were sold at a loss by dealers eager to be rid of them. After the parts stock was exhausted, a few outstanding customer orders were filled with Chrysler Windsors. Termination factors Despite being a successful mid-priced line for Chrysler for most of its life, DeSoto's failure was attributable to a combination of corporate mistakes and external factors beyond Chrysler's control. The Chrysler brand (under post-war pressures from consumers in the market) was essentially moved by customers' changing market tastes from a luxury automaker to a mid-priced brand when Chrysler itself launched the separate Imperial brand in 1954 for the 1955 model year. The mid-priced market segment was already filled with brands made by rivals Ford and General Motors, plus Chrysler's own Newport model. Most DeSoto models were merged into the new Chrysler Newport in 1961. =Recession= The 1958 recession seriously affected demand for mid-priced automobile makes. DeSoto sales were particularly affected, and sales failed to recover in 1959 and 1960. With falling sales, the 1959 and 1960 models were very similar to the concurrent Chryslers. Moreover, rumors that DeSoto would soon be discontinued did not help sales. =Dealer networks= DeSoto-Plymouth dealer on 815 Penn Avenue, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, ca. 1930–1945 Chrysler's dealer network also had an effect on the termination of the DeSoto brand. Following World War II, Chrysler had a large number of dealers that carried two or more Chrysler makes, with DeSoto-Plymouth and Chrysler–Plymouth relationships being the most common. However, as Chrysler attempted to spin Plymouth off into standalone dealerships, existing dealers typically chose to become higher-volume Plymouth dealerships rather than taking on the slower- selling DeSoto brand, leaving the marque with a weakened dealer network and fewer outlets selling its cars. DeSoto's failure to adjust to changing market trends, evidenced by its lack of a new compact car model in 1960 as GM, Ford and DeSoto's siblings Dodge and Plymouth had done, also hastened its demise. =Brand management and marketing= Chrysler's brand management during the 1950s pitted each of its five marques (Plymouth, Dodge, DeSoto, Chrysler and Imperial) against one another, causing the greatest damage to DeSoto. Rather than managing the market relationship to specific price points for particular consumers, as General Motors had done successfully, Chrysler allowed its divisions to develop products targeting markets covered by their own sister divisions. Dodge was most successful when it introduced the lower-priced Dodge Dart in 1960. The Dart was advertised in comparison to the \\"C\\" car, the \\"F\\" car and the \\"P\\" car (Chevrolet, Ford, and Plymouth, respectively). While sales of the Dart increased in 1960, they did so at the expense of Plymouth. Traditionally one of the three lower-priced brands, Plymouth fell out of third place, only to regain it twice (1971 and 1974) before its own demise in 2001. Dodge moved upmarket with the Custom Royal in the mid-1950s, which cut into and eroded DeSoto's traditional market segment. The introduction of the 1957 DeSoto Firesweep, a model that used the Dodge engine, chassis, front fenders and hood, pushed DeSoto into direct competition with the Custom Royal. The Firesweep sold well, but at the expense of the higher-priced Firedome and Fireflite models. The DeSoto began looking like a Chrysler with a different grille and taillights, which, in an era of strong make identification, was a recipe for disaster. When Chrysler marketing showed that consumers were likelier to buy an entry-level Chrysler than a DeSoto, Chrysler introduced the Chrysler Newport as a 1961 model, selling more than 45,000 units in its first year. At less than $3,000, the Newport covered the same price range as the 1961 DeSoto, which had sold 3,034 units total. Thus the DeSoto was dropped and replaced by the Newport. In 1962, Dodge also introduced its own DeSoto replacement, the large DeSoto-sized Dodge Custom 880. With the introduction of the Newport and the Custom 880, the price gap caused by the demise of DeSoto was effectively closed. Going in the opposite direction, Chrysler pushed into the luxury market by marketing the luxury Imperial as a separate make and division starting in 1955. To make room for the new make, Chrysler began expanding downward, while Dodge began expanding upward, with larger and more luxurious models. Both Chrysler and Dodge began eating into DeSoto's already small market, and Chrysler's upper management did nothing to stop them. DeSoto trucks De Soto AS700 truck, Turkey, 1989 Chrysler Corporation introduced the DeSoto brand of trucks in 1937 to provide a greater number of sales outlets overseas for the American-built Dodge and Fargo commercial vehicles. The DeSoto brand was badge-engineered sporadically on Dodge trucks made in Argentina (for the D-100 and the D-400http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2014/01/de-soto-400.html since 1960 to 1965), Australia, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom. Chrysler ended its truck operations in international markets in 1970. However, both the DeSoto and Fargo brands continued to be used on trucks made by Askam in Turkey. In 1978, Chrysler sold its share in the Askam venture to its Turkish partners.

The six of them hit it off immediately and very soon both Arno and Wiebe decided to complete the band's line-up. They released two tracks on a split EP on vinyl on the WOTNXT label. In 2002, the band signed a deal with BMG and released a 6-track EP. They then released No Matter What The Outcome on The Electric Co., a Dutch label focused on Dutch talent and linked to Universal Music.

In the United States there is only a voluntary federal certification for voting machines and each state has ultimate jurisdiction over certification, though most states currently require national certification for the voting systems. Germany In Germany the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt was responsible for certification of the voting machines for federal and European elections till 2009. Since the respective law, the Bundeswahlgeräteverordnung (\\"Federal Voting Machine Ordinance\\") is considered to be in contradiction to Germany's Constitution, this responsibility is suspended. The only machines certified so far are the Nedap ESD1 and ESD2. United States The US Election Assistance Commission has assumed federal responsibility for accrediting voting system test laboratories and certifying voting equipment through the Voting System Certification & Laboratory Accreditation Program. The purpose of the program is to independently verify that voting systems comply with the functional capabilities, accessibility, and security requirements necessary to ensure the integrity and reliability of voting system operation, as established in the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG). With this program the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will recommend labs for accreditation through its National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP). The VVSG provide a set of specifications and requirements against which voting systems can be tested to determine if the systems provide all of the basic functionality, accessibility and security capabilities required of these systems. In addition, the guidelines establish evaluation criteria for the national certification of voting systems. The EAC's Technical Guidelines Development Committee, with technical support from NIST are tasked with developing an initial set of recommendations for each VVSG iteration.2005 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines Volume 1 After the initial draft guidelines are authored, they are sent to the EAC for review and revision and then released for public comment.

Early life He was the fourth son of Sorley Boy MacDonnell, and of his first wife Mary, daughter of Conn O'Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone. He succeeded on the death of his brother Sir James MacDonnell in April 1601 to the lordship of the Glynns and Route in Ireland. Tyrone's Rebellion In 1597, he gave offence to the English Crown by assisting Sir James to fortify Dunluce Castle and took part in the defeat which the MacDonnells inflicted that year upon Sir John Chichester and the garrison of Carrickfergus. He joined O'Neill in his rebellion, and accompanied him on his expedition into Munster early in 1600, but, becoming by his brother's death head of his house, and foreseeing the failure of the rebellion, he in August 1602 made a timely submission to the lord deputy, Lord Mountjoy, at Tullaghoge, offering to serve against O'Neill in Fermanagh with five hundred foot and forty horse at his own expense. His example exercised a good effect in the north, and he was knighted by Lord Mountjoy. On the accession of James I, MacDonnell, on 28 May 1603, received a grant of the entire district of the Route and the Glynns, extending from Larne to Coleraine, and containing 333,907 acres. To this in the following year was added the island of Rathlin. In 1606, Dunluce Castle, the priory of Coleraine, three-parts of the fishing of the river Bann, the castle of Olderfleet (Larne), and all lands belonging to the Diocese of Down and Connor were for different reasons excepted out of his grant; but on 21 June 1615 Dunluce Castle was restored to him. His fourth part of the fishing of the River Bann, which he regarded as 'the best stay of his living,' involved him in a long and profitless controversy with James Hamilton, 1st Viscount Claneboye. In 1607, probably on account of his old connection with O'Neill, and because he had about 1604 married O'Neill's daughter Elice, he was charged by Christopher St Lawrence, 10th Baron Howth with being concerned in the events which culminated in the flight of the two northern earls. He appeared voluntarily before the Lord Deputy of Ireland , Sir Arthur Chichester, denied the truth of the charge, and experienced no further trouble on that account. Dunluce Castle, his principal residence. Plantation and Earldom The Flight of the Earls in 1607 left him as one of the most senior Gaelic figures remaining in Ulster. In 1608 when Sir Cahir O'Doherty launched O'Doherty's Rebellion by burning Derry, MacDonnell did not consider joining forces with him. O'Doherty, a former loyalist to the Crown had been angered at his treatment by local officials. O'Doherty was defeated and killed at the Battle of Kilmacrennan and the rebellion collapsed. In the wake of the rebellion the government decided to bring in a more wide-ranging Plantation of Ulster than had originally been planned. This didn't greatly affect MacDonnell as Counties Antrim and Down were excluded from the Plantation, as large-scale Scottish settling was already taking place there. His prudent conduct was not approved by his kinsmen, and part of the 1614 conspiracy was to depose him in favour of Alexander, son of his elder brother James. But it strengthened his influence at court, and having by his judicious conduct in the matter of the Londoners' plantation at Coleraine, and the zeal with which he strove to civilise his own country, effaced all memory of his early conduct, he was, on 29 June 1618, created Viscount Dunluce. Shortly afterwards he was admitted a member of the Privy Council of Ireland, appointed Lord Lieutenant of Antrim, placed in command of a regiment, and on 12 December 1620 advanced to the earldom of Antrim. Later life Like his father and the MacDonnells generally, he was a Roman Catholic. In 1621, he was charged, on the information of a certain Alexander Boyd, with harbouring priests in his house. He at once confessed his fault, promised never to fall into the like error again, and was graciously pardoned, but compelled to pay the reward due to Boyd for his information against him. On seeking a confirmation of his estates under the commission of grace in 1629, he was opposed by Cahil O'Hara of Kildrome, who claimed certain lands included in the original grant, and either by course of law or from dictates of prudence O'Hara's claims were allowed. During his declining years, Antrim suffered from dropsy. He sat in the Parliament of Ireland on the first day of the session of 1634, but was excused from further attendance. In January 1635, he concluded a bargain with James Campbell, Lord Cantire, afterwards Earl of Irvine, for the purchase of the lordship of Cantire, originally in the possession of the MacDonnells, but they had been expelled in 1607. The arrangement was opposed by the Lord of Lome, and Antrim's death intervening, the matter sank for a time into abeyance. He died at Dunluce on 10 December 1636, and was buried in the vault he had built at Bonamargy Friary in 1621. Shortly before his death he completed the castle at Glenarm. Family Prior to his marriage, MacDonnell was the father of three sons, all of whom were probably illegitimate. One, known as Morrisne or Maurice MacDonnell, was hanged at Coleraine in 1643 for his share in the rebellion of 1641 ; another, Francis Macdonnell, O.S.F., was an ecclesiastic, and the third was James. By his wife Aellis, Elice, or Alice, third daughter of Hugh O'Neill by his fourth wife Catherine Magennis, he had two sons, Randal MacDonnell created Marquis of Antrim, who got the baronies of Dunluce and Kilconway with the castle of Dunluce, and Alexander, who succeeded to the earldom and the barony of Glenarm, and six daughters, to each of whom he bequeathed £2,800, viz. Anne, who was married first to Christopher Nugent, Baron Delvin, and secondly to William Fleming, nineteenth Baron Slane; Mary, who was married first to Lucas, second Viscount Dillon, and secondly to Oliver Plunket, sixth Baron Louth; Sarah, who was married first to Niall Oge O'Neill of Killelagh, in co. Antrim, secondly to Sir Charles O'Conor Sligo, and thirdly to Donal MacCarthy Mor; Catherine, who was married to Edward Plunket of Castlecor, County Meath, younger son of Patrick Plunket, 9th Baron Dunsany; Rose, who was married to Colonel George Gordon, brother of John Gordon, 14th Earl of Sutherland, who came to Ulster in 1642 as an officer in Major-general Monro's army, and to whose assistance the Marquis of Antrim owed his escape from prison at Carrickfergus in 1643; and Alice, who never married.. His widow died in 1665.

In the 14th century, when John de Leghes was a retainer of the local Lord of the Manor, Lees was a conglomeration of hamlets, ecclesiastically linked with the township of Ashton-under-Lyne. Farming was the main industry of this rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom weaving in the domestic system. At the beginning of the 19th century, Lees had obtained a reputation for its mineral springs; ambitions to develop a spa town were thwarted by an unplanned process of urbanisation caused by the rise of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. Lees expanded into a mill town in the late-19th century, on the back of neighbouring Oldham's boom in cotton spinning. Lees Urban District had eleven cotton mills at its manufacturing zenith. History The Industrial Revolution brought cotton spinning to Lees in the form of eleven textile mills, changing the character of the village completely. The settlement dates back to the 14th century and is thought to have been named after former retainer of the manor, John de Leghes. Lees was one of the localities which, on 16 August 1819, sent a contingent of parishioners to the mass public demonstration at Manchester, now known as the Peterloo massacre. In the week before Peterloo (an assembly demanding the reform of parliamentary representation), weavers in Lees had paraded through the village with a large black flag adorned with the slogans \\"no Borough Mongering, Taxation Without Representation is Unject and Tyrannical,\\" and \\"Unite and be Free, Equal Representation or Death\\". The growing unrest in the village prompted one alarmed inhabitant to write to the Home Office. In the late-18th century, a natural chalybeate spring was discovered in the locality, and by the-early 19th century the village gained a reputation for these \\"fashionable\\" mineral springs. In the early 19th century, water from Lees Spa, had become fashionable to drink, so much so, that it was bottled and sold around the country. In the month of August 1821, 60,000 people visited Lees Spa. Ambitions to develop Lees into a spa town – \\"Lancashire's very own Harrogate\\" – were thwarted by an unplanned process of urbanisation caused by introduction and profitability of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution brought cotton spinning to Lees in the form of eleven mills, which by the late-19th century, had changed the character of the village completely. Lees has grown in size recently in terms of both amenities and residential population, in its role as a commuter village for people working in Oldham and West Yorkshire. It is home to commercial and distribution companies. The main street is notable for the number of public houses in close proximity.

Governance Lees (or Hey) was within the Knott Lanes division of the parish and township of Ashton-under- Lyne, and hundred of Salford. In 1859 a Local Board of Health (at first known as Lees-with-Crossbank, subsequently as Lees) was established for the Lees area. This area was in the Ashton-under-Lyne poor law union. Between 1894 and 1974, Lees constituted the Lees Urban District, in the administrative county of Lancashire; the Local Board became the Lees Urban District Council. As the district was situated entirely between the County Borough of Oldham and the West Riding of Yorkshire, it constituted an exclave of the administrative county of Lancashire. In 1911 part of the urban district was added to the civil parish of Crossbank, but in 1914 Crossbank was absorbed into the Lees Urban District. In 1974 the Lees Urban District was amalgamated with six other local government districts, to form the newly created Metropolitan Borough of Oldham within the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. The Saddleworth & Lees area committee meets regularly to discuss the progress of the villages. Geography The village consists of a small cluster of shops and businesses on either side of the A669 Lees High Street, surrounded by some terraced houses, cottages and some small estates. Lees is separated from the main conurbation of Oldham by a small amount of green belt land in the valley of Leesbrook, on either bank of the River Medlock. A part of Lees is known locally as County End; Springhead in Saddleworth forms a contiguous urban area with Lees, though the border between the two forms part of the ancient county boundary between Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire. Crossbank is an area of Lees. Transport Lees is accessed on the roads on the A669 from Saddleworth and Oldham. Along this road, there are frequent buses running towards Oldham and Manchester on First Greater Manchester's 180 and 184 services. Other destinations which can be reached from Lees on the bus are Huddersfield, Hyde, Middleton, Mossley, Saddleworth and Stalybridge. Lees railway station closed in 1955, followed by the complete closure of the line in 1964.An Illustrated History of Oldham's Railways by John Hooper () There was also a small engine shed east of the station. Notable people Notable people associated with Lees include Springhead-born Annie Kenney, one of the first suffragettes to be imprisoned worked at Lees's Leesbrook Mill. Annie's younger, Lees-born sister Jessie Kenney was also a campaigner for women's suffrage in the United Kingdom. By the age of 21 Jessie was the Women's Social and Political Union's youngest organiser. Laurence Chaderton, one of the original translators of the Authorized King James Version of the Bible was a native of Lees. Disgraced former MP Phil Woolas lives in the locality.

Structured analysis and design technique (SADT) is a systems engineering and software engineering methodology for describing systems as a hierarchy of functions. SADT is a structured analysis modelling language, which uses two types of diagrams: activity models and data models. It was developed in the late 1960s by Douglas T. Ross, and was formalized and published as IDEF0 in 1981. Overview Structured analysis and design technique (SADT) is a diagrammatic notation designed specifically to help people describe and understand systems.D. Marca, C. McGowan, Structured Analysis and Design Technique, McGraw-Hill, 1987, It offers building blocks to represent entities and activities, and a variety of arrows to relate boxes. These boxes and arrows have an associated informal semantics.John Mylopoulos (2004). Conceptual Modelling III. Structured Analysis and Design Technique (SADT). Retrieved 21 September 2008. SADT can be used as a functional analysis tool of a given process, using successive levels of details. The SADT method not only allows one to define user needs for IT developments, which is often used in the industrial Information Systems, but also to explain and present an activity’s manufacturing processes and procedures.SADT at Free-logistics.com. Retrieved 21 September 2008. History SADT has been developed and field- tested during the period of 1969 to 1973 by Douglas T. Ross and SofTech, Inc..D. T. Ross: Structured Analysis (SA): A Language for Communicating Ideas. IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, SE-3(1), pp. 16-34. Abstract The methodology was used in the MIT Automatic Programming Tool (APT) project. It received extensive use starting in 1973 by the US Air Force Integrated Computer Aided Manufacturing program. According to Levitt (2000) SADT is \\"part of a series of structured methods, that represent a collection of analysis, design, and programming techniques that were developed in response to the problems facing the software world from the 1960s to the 1980s. In this timeframe most commercial programming was done in COBOL and Fortran, then C and BASIC. There was little guidance on “good” design and programming techniques, and there were no standard techniques for documenting requirements and designs. Systems were getting larger and more complex, and the information system development became harder and harder to do so. As a way to help manage large and complex software.Dave Levitt (2000):Introduction to Structured Analysis and Design . Retrieved 21 September 2008. SADT was among a series of similar structured methods, which had emerged since the 1960 such as: * Structured programming in circa 1967 with Edsger W. Dijkstra. * Structured design around 1975 with Larry Constantine and Ed Yourdon * Structured analysis in circa 1978 with Tom DeMarco, Yourdon, Gane & Sarson, McMenamin & Palmer. * Information technology engineering in circa 1990 with James Martin.

This decomposition is conducted only in the physical domain from an axiomatic design viewpoint.Nam Pyo Suh (2007). Axiomatic Design - Advances and Applications. New York : Oxford University Press Chapter 5, pp. 239-298. =Diagrams= SADT uses two types of diagrams: activity models and data models. It uses arrows to build these diagrams. The SADT’s representation is the following: * A main box where the name of the process or the action is specified * On the left-hand side of this box, incoming arrows: inputs of the action. * On the upper part, the incoming arrows: data necessary for the action. * On the bottom of the box, incoming arrows: means used for the action. * On the right-hand side of the box, outgoing arrows: outputs of the action. The semantics of arrows for activities: * Inputs enter from the left and represent data or consumables that are needed by the activity. * Outputs exit to the right and represent data or products that are produced by the activity. * Controls enter from the top and represent commands or conditions which influence the execution of an activity but are not consumed. * Mechanisms identify the means, components or tools used to accomplish the activity. Represents allocation of activities. The semantics of arrows for data: * Inputs are activities that produce the data. * Outputs consume the data. * Controls influence the internal state of the data. = Roles = According to Mylopoulos (2004) in the software development process multiple roles can or should be distinguished: * Author or developer of the SADT models * Commenters, who review the author's work * Readers or users of the SADT models * Experts, who can advise the authors * Technical committee or reviewers of the SADT models in detail * Project librarian, who govern the project documentation * Project manager, who governs the system analysis and design. * Monitor or chief analyst to assists SADT developers and users * Instructor to train SADT developers and users  Usage  SADT is used as diagrammatic notation in conceptual design of software engineering and systems engineering to sketch applications, for more detailed structured analysis, for requirements definition,Ross, Douglas T., and Kenneth E.

Whysall was a right-handed batsman who did little before the First World War but then developed in the 1920s into a solid and consistent opener in the increasingly successful Nottinghamshire side. He toured Australia as a member of the 1924-25 side, acting as reserve wicket- keeper and playing in three Test matches. He scored 75 at Adelaide and 76 at Melbourne. After being the leading batsman in Nottinghamshire's County Championship-winning side of 1929, Whysall was recalled to the England Test team for the decisive match of the 1930 series against Australia. The move was not a success. Whysall scored only 13 and 10, and was criticised for his lack of mobility in the field, as England lost by an innings. Barely two months later, Whysall was dead. He slipped on a dance floor, injured his elbow, and died within two weeks from septicaemia despite a blood transfusion. Whysall was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1925.

Biography Thorkelson was born in Egersund, a coastal town in the county of Rogaland, Norway. Thorkelson immigrated to the United States in 1892; he studied nautical navigation, and later worked as navigator and sailing master on ocean-going ships. He graduated from the College of Physicians and Surgeons at the University of Maryland, Baltimore in 1911, and served as a member of the faculty from 1911 until 1913. In 1913, Thorkelson moved to Montana. He practiced medicine while residing successively in Dillon, Warm Springs, and Butte. Military service Thorkelson served with the Virginia Naval Reserve, a militia organization, from 1897 to 1899. He was also in the United States Navy Reserve from 1936 until 1939, and attained the rank of lieutenant commander. Political career In 1938, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Montana's 1st congressional district as a Republican, defeating incumbent Democratic Congressman Jerry J. O'Connell in the general election. Thorkelson was labeled as \\"rabidly pro- fascist and anti-semitic\\" and \\"Jew-baiting, Fascist-minded\\" by contemporary journalists for his use of the Congressional Record to reprint anti-British and anti-Jewish propaganda and his support for retired General George Van Horn Moseley. Commentator Walter Winchell called Thorkelson \\"the mouthpiece of the Nazi movement in congress\\". Thorkelson later sued Winchell for $1.8 million after being included by Winchell as one of a list of \\"Americans We Can Do Without\\".\\"Page Masters\\" (Time Magazine. November. 30, 1942) Modern historians have described Thorkelson as \\"best known for his diatribes against Jews and the New Deal and for his calls to revise the United States Constitution\\" and \\"a raging anti-semite and pro-fascist\\". Thorkelson inserted into the Congressional Record quotations from the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, from World Hoax by Ernest Fredrick Elmhurst, from blackshirt Sir Oswald Mosley's Action, from Los Angeles based Nazi-leaning publication Christian Free Press; and defended himself by saying: When he ran for re-election in 1940, he was defeated in the Republican primary by former United States Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin. Following his defeat, he ran for the United States Senate in 1942, but came third in the primary to Wellington D. Rankin and Charles R. Dawley. He ran for Governor of Montana in 1944 against incumbent Governor Sam C. Ford, but lost to Ford in a landslide. Death and burial Thorkelson died in Butte on November 20, 1945, and was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Butte.

These fresh water ponds are separated from the salty sea below and around it, until breaks in the ice merge the two. Melt ponds are pools of open water that form on sea ice in the warmer months of spring and summer. The ponds are also found on glacial ice and ice shelves. Ponds of melted water can also develop under the ice. Melt ponds are usually darker than the surrounding ice, and their distribution and size is highly variable. They absorb solar radiation rather than reflecting it as ice does and, thereby, have a significant influence on Earth's radiation balance. This differential, which had not been scientifically investigated until recently, has a large effect on the rate of ice melting and the extent of ice cover. Melt ponds can melt through to the ocean's surface. Seawater entering the pond increases the melt rate because the salty water of the ocean is warmer than the fresh water of the pond. The increase in salinity also depresses the water's freezing point. Water from melt ponds over land surface can run into crevasses or moulins – tubes leading under ice sheets or glaciers – turning into meltwater. The water may reach the underlying rock. The effect is an increase in the rate of ice flow to the oceans, as the fluid behaves like a lubricant in the basal sliding of glaciers.  Effects of melt ponds The effects of melt ponds are diverse (this subsection refers to melt ponds on ice sheets and ice shelves). Research by Ted Scambos, of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, has supported the melt water fracturing theory that suggests the melting process associated with melt ponds has a substantial effect on ice shelf disintegration. Seasonal melt ponded and penetrating under glaciers shows seasonal acceleration and deceleration of ice flows affecting whole icesheets.Surface Melt-Induced Acceleration of Greenland Ice-Sheet Flow Originally published in Science Express on 6 June 2002, Science 12 July 2002: Vol. 297. no. 5579, pp. 218 - 222.

The show itself was showcased all around Latin America between 1996 and 2001. Programme (The programme may vary by country; this was the programme showcased in Argentina on 27 June 1998.) 1\\\\. Para Elizabeth – Sonata a La Carta (To Elizabeth – Letter Sonata) * A musical composer receives a letter from his lover and decides to compose a piece inspired by its contents. The lover, however, after recalling some warm moments that they shared together, announces that she has in fact found someone rich and fabulous. The music underlines this revelation in a very funny way with the help of Daniel Rabinovich who makes additional sound effects. 2\\\\. La Princesa Caprichosa – Pequeña Serenata para Instrumentos Grandes (The Capricious Princess – Small Serenade for Big Instruments) * A nobleman tries to win the heart of Princess Kunegunda of Rochester by playing serenades to her. She mocks him (singing), telling him repeatedly how his rival does everything better. The desperate nobleman comes with bigger and more fantastic musical instruments, but in the end he changes his mind in favor of someone less capricious, and very unexpected at that. Carlos López Puccio with his long silver hair makes a hilarious appearance as the Princess. 3\\\\. La Vida Es Hermosa – Disuacidio (Life Is Beautiful – Dissuacide) * A musical parody of a phone-in center for the Assistance to Potential Suicides. The fictitious musical compositor Johann Sebastian Mastropiero composed the special soothing music that is being played to the potential suicides, explaining how beautiful the world actually is. Or isn't it? 4\\\\. La Hija de Escipión – Fragmento De Opera (The Daughter of Escipion – Operatic Fragment) * The presentation starts with a hilarious Introduction by Marcos Mundstock. This is a fragment of a funny opera depicting Daniel the Seducer trying to sing a ballad to a lady under her balcony. Daniel gets interrupted at different times with funny outcomes until the lady's father, the terrible Escipion, overhears him and comes down wanting to kill him. The situation almost ends in a disaster for Daniel the Seducer, though not because of Escipion's sharp sword. It is because Escipion somehow finds Daniel to be a likeable young man and insists on the couple getting married. 5\\\\. La Redención del Vampiro – Hematopeya (The Redemption of The Vampire) * A group of activists from Vampires Anonymous comes to a castle in Transylvania to save the soul of a vampire who resides there. They play him an enticing song depicting the beauties of life among normal humans and abstaining from blood. In the end they assure the almost convinced vampire that he won't miss doing evil as a normal human – he can choose to be a minister or a president. 6\\\\. Educación Sexual Moderna – Cántico Enclaustrado (Modern Sexual Education) * A musical parody of religious chants. It teaches some basics of sexual education to monks, but as the singers are too ashamed to sing aloud the explicit words, they choose some filler sounds instead so the chant ends up having meaning only for an experienced sinner. 7\\\\. Quién Mató a Tom McCoffee – Musica En Serie (Who Killed Tom McCoffee? – Serial Music) * A parody of detective series, which involves a whole jazz band killing its saxophone player because he played badly. 8\\\\. La Comisión – Himnovaciones (The Commission – Hymnnovations) * Note: The Act was long, so it was reparted through the show. The Act is about the composer Mangiacaprini given the task of making a new national anthem, but including propaganda of the President's Political Party inside the anthem. Bonus Act: Perdónala – Bolérolo (Forgive Her) * A bolero where the main singer describes how horrible his wife has been to him, and the group of accompanying singers consoling him, advising him to put up with her and love her nevertheless.

In 1907 he was a member of the Russian Duma. From 1912 to 1914 he was bishop of Kholm with the title of archbishop, and from 1914 to 1919 he was archbishop of Volhynia. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 Russian Orthodox Christians based outside Russia or who fled there from the communist regime found themselves in a difficult situation; and in 1921 Eulogius was appointed by Saint Tikhon, Patriarch of Moscow to head the ‘Provisional administration of the Russian parishes in Western Europe’. During the early 1920s the majority of Russian Orthodox abroad, united by their opposition to the Soviet government, were members of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR), in whose synod Eulogius sat. In 1927 Eulogius broke with the ROCOR (along with Metropolitan Platon (Rozhdestvensky) of New York, leader of the Russian Metropolia in America) and was subsequently condemned by them, splitting the Russian émigré community in western Europe. In 1928 Metropolitan Sergius (Stragorodsky), then locum tenens of the Patriarchate of Moscow, demanded declarations of loyalty to the Soviet regime, a proposition which Eulogius initially supported but subsequently repudiated. In 1930, after taking part in a prayer service in London in supplication for Christians suffering under the Soviets, Eulogius was removed from office by Sergius and replaced. Most of Eulogius' parishes remained loyal to him, however, as they were generally against the Soviet government. Eulogius then petitioned Patriarch Photios II of Constantinople to be received under his canonical care by virtue of the canons of the Council of Chalcedon. He and his community were received in 1931, becoming an exarchate of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. In 1945, shortly before his death, Eulogius led the exarchate in a return to the Moscow patriarchate. After Eulogius's death (8 April 1946), Metropolitan Seraphim (Lukyanov) of Western Europe was appointed the new exarch by the Moscow Patriarchate. A large number of parishes, opposed to Seraphim, once again entered the Patriarchate of Constantinople, forming the basis of the exarchate which continued to 2018.

In a qualitative test a sample is first reacted with a mixture of acetic acid and hydrogen iodide in a test tube. The ensuing reaction results in the cleavage of the ether or the ester into an alkyl iodide and respectively an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Zeisel determination By heating this mixture, the gases are allowed to come into contact with a piece of paper higher up the test tube saturated with silver nitrate. Any alkyl iodide present will give a reaction with the silver compound to silver iodide which has a red or yellow color. By filtering and weighing this precipitate it is possible to quantitatively calculate the number of iodine atoms and hence alkoxy groups. For example, prior to the development of the more precise methods of NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, the Zeisel test was widely used to determine the number of methoxy (-OCH3) and ethoxy (-OCH2CH3) groups in carbohydrate and organophosphorus insecticides. An alternative qualitative Zeisel test can be done with the use of mercury(II) nitrate instead of silver nitrate, leading to the formation of scarlet red mercury(II) iodide.

He returned to Qatar on 27 July 2008. He was reportedly born on 12 August 1973, in Doha, Qatar according to the Department of Defense.  Early life  Al Marri studied English in Texas in from 1993-1994. He studied at both Texas A&M; and Dexter Hall. He returned to Qatar and married his wife in 1995. He has three children.  Recruitment  According to his Department of Defense Detainee Assessment, it is believed that he traveled in Mecca in 2001 where he met Abu Walid al-Makki who began to talk to him about Islam and jihad. Al-Makki introduced him to Muhammad al- Saudi al-Harabi who was his contact for joining the jihad in Afghanistan. Because he believed that his family would not support his participation in jihad he told them that he would be traveling to Pakistan to memorize the Koran. Al Marri arrived in Pakistan on September 6, 2001, and contacted al- Harabi who connected him to a man named al-Zubail who transported him to Kandahar, Afghanistan. He was then moved to the al-Faruq training camp. He was ultimately being moved from the camp into Pakistan to return home when he was arrested on December 6, 2001, trying to cross into Pakistan.  Terrorist support and activities  Al Marri was detained at the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. He was suspected of trying to transfer $10,000 of \\"al Qaeda operational funds\\" to his brother, Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, under the direction of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the September 11 attacks. Since his repatriation to Qatar, he has reportedly been publicizing for a Qatari fundraising campaign called Madid Ahl al-Sham which the Nusra Front endorsed as a fundraising campaign in support of al-Qaeda. The campaign was believed to have been run by Sa'd bin Sa'd Muhammad Shariyan al-Kabi and Abd al-Latif Bin Adballah Salih Muhammad al-Kawari, both of whom are U.S. Treasury Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs). Jail conditions Al Marri's Guantanamo detainee ID number was 334. =Al-Marri's position= Al-Marri participated in the hunger strikes held during the summer of 2005. According to the Center for Constitutional Rights: > As Jarallah Al-Marri, a prisoner from Qatar, stated, \\"I participated in a > hunger strike for 17 days to protest the inhumane conditions and religious > persecution I and hundreds of other prisoners have been subject to at > Guantánamo.\\" Guantanamo Legal Update 8.25.05 , Center for Constitutional > Rights, August 25, 2005 > Further details of the seriousness of the prisoners' claims are also > emerging. Al-Marri, for example, was hospitalized as a result of his hunger > strike and a deteriorating heart condition, and placed on an IV. He told his > attorney, Jonathan Hafetz of Gibbons Del Deo Dolan Griffinger & Vecchione, > that the government had a nurse make sexual advances towards him while he > was lying in his hospital bed in a vain attempt to convince him to give up > his hunger strike.

According to an article in The Columbia Journalist, from 12 December 2005, al- Marri had only had two visits from his lawyers.New Congressional Bill May Alter Legal Limbo for Guantanamo Bay Prisoners, The Columbia Journalist, December 12, 2005 Detention of Al-Marri's Brother Al-Marri's brother Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, formerly a graduate student at Bradley University, is currently held in a South Carolina naval prison. On September 10, 2001, al- Marri came to Peoria with his family to become a graduate student at his undergraduate alma mater, Bradley University. Al-Marri was indicted and arrested on credit card fraud and lying to the FBI. He is being detained as a supposed al-Qaeda operative who came to the US to assist in a second wave of terrorist attacks. Al-Marri denies this. Repatriation and detention by British authorities On July 28, 2008, al-Marri was reported to have been repatriated to Qatar. His cousin and mother thanked the Emir for his help in securing his repatriation. As part of the repatriation deal between Qatar and the U.S., a signed agreement stipulated that al Marri would not be allowed to travel outside of Qatar. The Qataris also promised that if he even tried to leave Qatar that they would notify the United States immediately. This, however, did not happen and al Marri was allowed to leave Qatar twice without the Qataris notifying the United States. He was ultimately arrested on visa fraud in the United Kingdom. In a telephone interview, al-Marri told reporters he was detained at Heathrow Airport on February 23, 2009, on the claim that his visa application had not stated that he was a former Guantanamo captive. Al Marri said he had told the British officials who helped him complete his visa application about his stay in Guantanamo. Al Marri had toured the United Kingdom on a speaking tour, with Moazzam Begg, a few weeks before his 23 February detention. Moazzam Begg was arrested in 2014 by the UK on allegations that he was funding and training terrorists in Syria. He has since been released. The U.S. Ambassador to Qatar at the time determined that the decision to let al Marri travel outside of Qatar despite the agreement had to have been made and approved by Qatar's attorney general. The U.S. has labeled Qatar an \\"inconsistent\\" partner in combating terror finance.

He was the National Party MP for Tauranga from 2005 to 2008. Biography In 1958 Clarkson qualified as a fitter and turner in Gisborne. He then moved to the Waikato and worked on the Kaimai Tunnel. He began selling and servicing tractors in Matamata before deciding to import V8 motors from the United States – a business he continued for nine years. Clarkson then moved into commercial building construction. Clarkson has played field hockey for the Poverty Bay provincial team. He was selected as a standby goalie for the New Zealand team that won Gold at the 1976 Summer Olympics. He was also a member of the New Zealand Stock Car Racing Team from 1968 to 1971, and held seven New Zealand titles in Dragster racing during 1972–1975. Clarkson was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to philanthropy, in the 2003 New Year Honours. Member of Parliament In the 2005 election, Clarkson was recruited as the National candidate for the Tauranga seat. He challenged Winston Peters, leader of the New Zealand First party, who had held the seat for twenty-one years. The contest was of national significance as party must have 5% of the vote or an electorate seat to qualify for proportional representation in parliament. A loss by Peters could have deprived New Zealand First of its electorate seat, leaving it vulnerable to a decline in its vote. Clarkson won the seat by 730 votes, a 2.02% majority over Winston Peters. However, New Zealand First retained representation by achieving 5.72% of the vote. As a member of parliament, Clarkson was the National Party's associate spokesperson for Building and Construction and Housing. =Controversies=Sexual harassment: \\"left testicle\\" During the campaign sexual harassment allegations were made against Clarkson by a former employee. Clarkson claimed the allegations were the result of a misunderstanding arising from a mention of his left testicle to a colleague. It was claimed Clarkson repeatedly made jokes, such as \\"I bet my left testicle the all blacks will win\\" to female employees. Mr Clarkson, in the heat of the controversy, grabbed and talked about his crotch to a female reporter. Campaign overspending petition Winston Peters filed a petition in the High Court of New Zealand alleging that Clarkson had spent more on campaigning than is allowed under the New Zealand Electoral Act. The Act prescribes a campaign spending limit of $20,000 per local candidate. Peters alleged that Clarkson had spent more than $100,000. However the High Court found that Clarkson had only spent $18,159. The court ordered Peters to pay $40,000 in legal costs to Bob Clarkson. Controversy over minority groups In several interviews, Clarkson has made a number of comments which caused offense to Muslim and homosexual groups. He was reported as saying that Muslim women wearing burqas, who did not want to fit in should \\"go back to Islam or Iraq\\" and that burqas should not be worn in banks or courts. Clarkson also made reference the number of gay and lesbian Members of Parliament (MPs) in the New Zealand Labour Party and was quoted as saying \\"We've got a problem there they are employing more of those than average people.\\" The National Party MP caused further controversy after comparing homosexuality to nose picking saying that \\"If you walk up and down the street picking your nose, you're a bit different, aren't you? You're going to offend somebody.\\" Clarkson was also reported as saying he had nothing against gays and lesbians unless they tried to \\"ram it down\\" his throat. Folole Muliaga Mr Clarkson during a parliamentary debate on an electricity regulation to protect vulnerable customers yelled out \\"pay your bill\\" several times while the case of Folole Muliaga was being discussed. Mrs Muliaga died after her electricity was cut because she could not afford to pay the overdue bill. When asked to apologise in parliament after offence was taken by another member to the interjection, Mr Clarkson left the House after refusing to apologise. Clarkson said: \\"Sorry that's his problem.\\" Mr Clarkson was reprimanded for the comments after John Key said the comments were \\"distasteful.\\" =Stepping down from Parliament= In May 2008 it was announced Clarkson would not stand for re-election. He did not deliver a valedictory speech before he left Parliament on 25 September 2008. In 2011 he announced he was leaving the National party and joining ACT New Zealand,Bob Clarkson jumps ship to join Act Bay of Plenty Times, 1 June 2011 but he did not win any electorates after joining ACT, eventually leaving that party as well.

Once On A Time is a fairy tale by English writer A. A. Milne. Written in 1917, Milne's introduction begins \\"This is an odd book\\". Ostensibly a typical fairytale, it tells the story of the war between the kingdoms of Euralia and Barodia and the political shenanigans which take place in Euralia in the king's absence, all supposedly rewritten by Milne from the writings of the fictional historian \\"Roger Scurvilegs\\". Milne created the story to contain believable, three- dimensional characters, rather than the stereotypes which will satisfy children. Hence the book introduces us to a princess who is far from helpless; a prince who, whilst handsome, is also pompous and vain; an enchantment which is almost entirely humorous; a villain who is not entirely villainous and receives no real comeuppance; a good king who is not always good; an evil king who is not always evil, and so on. The result is a book which children may not enjoy as much as adults. The book was written by Milne partly for his wife, upon whom the character of the Countess Belvane was partially based. Plot summary When the King of Barodia receives a pair of seven-league boots as a birthday present, his habit of flying over the King of Euralia's castle during breakfast provokes a series of incidents which escalate into war. While the King of Euralia is away, his daughter Hyacinth tries to rule in his stead and counter the machiavellian ambitions of the king's favourite, the Countess Belvane. Characters *King Merriwig of Euralia: fat, jolly if occasionally pompous and easily led. He nevertheless can show great strength of mind, as related in an anecdote in which he outwitted a fairy, mostly by sheer stubbornness. *Princess Hyacinth: Merriwig's daughter. Rather more savvy than her father, she is nevertheless at first out of her depth when trying to rule the kingdom in his absence. Despite this, she grows into the role. *The King of Barodia: Bombastic, proud and arrogant, and takes inordinate pride in his moustache. *The Countess Belvane: A difficult character. Beautiful, proud and haughty, she is inclined to melodramatics and emotional self-indulgence. Ostensibly the villain of the piece, her motives are complex and subtle. *Lady Wiggs: Hyacinth's closest friend; helpful and dreamy. *Lady Woggs: A palace servant; well-meaning but terribly dim. *Prince Udo of Araby: Prince of a neighbouring realm, invited by Hyacinth to help her in her troubles with Belvane. He turns out to be very little help at all, partly due to suffering an embarrassing enchantment, but mostly due to his personality. *Coronel: Udo's companion-at-arms and best friend. Far more laid-back and likeable than the prince. *Roger Scurvilegs: noted historian of Euralia, author of the monumental work Euralia Past and Present. The narrator gives him credit for the basic facts of the story whilst gently lampooning him for his stuffiness. Themes and issues Milne himself resisted characterising the book.

Yards gained from the receiving play are credited to the receiver as receiving yards. If such a pass is not caught by the receiver, it is called an incomplete pass or simply an incompletion.

Jack Narz served as the program's host, with Colgate-Palmolive as its presenting sponsor. Dotto rose to become the highest rated daytime program in television history, as of 1958. Dotto replaced Strike it Rich in CBS's 11:30 am daytime time slot on January 6, 1958. In a rare instance of two networks programming the same show, a weekly nighttime edition was launched on July 1, 1958 on CBS's competitor NBC on Tuesday nights in their 9:00p.m. slot. At the height of both shows' popularity, Dotto was abruptly cancelled without public explanation over the weekend of August 16, 1958. Soon after, Dotto was publicly revealed to have been fixed by its producer, tarnishing the show's reputation and setting the stage for legal and political investigation of the fixing of 1950s quiz shows. Gameplay Two contestants, one a returning champion, competed in each episode of Dotto. The object of the game was to identify the subject of an incomplete portrait drawing, which was accomplished by answering questions and connecting dots. The champion and the challenger were both given their own version of the portrait, which contained fifty dots for each contestant to connect. The contestants were positioned on stage in a manner where neither one could see the other or their progress. There was also an overhead projector on stage that was called the \\"Dottograph\\", which would come into play as the game progressed. Play in each game started with the challenger and he/she was given a category along with a choice of three questions, each with a corresponding number of dots to connect. The questions were worth five, eight, or ten dots and more dots meant a higher difficulty. Answering correctly enabled the challenger to have his/her dots connected, but a wrong answer or failure to answer gave that privilege to the champion. To further assist the contestants in identifying the subjects of the portrait, three clues were provided. These were unlocked once a contestant reached a certain number of connections. The first required a total of twenty-five connections, the second thirty-five, and the last forty-five. At any point in the game, including during the opposing player's turn, a contestant could signal that he/she knew the answer by pressing a signaling device; a buzzer for the challenger and a bell for the champion. Host Jack Narz would then direct that contestant to walk to the Dottograph, which the opposing player could not see, and write that answer on the projector screen. After the answer was recorded, Narz would reveal if the contestant had answered correctly. If he/she did, the opponent was given one last chance to force a tie and play on by correctly identifying the subject based on his/her own progress during the game; if he/she could not do so the first contestant won the game. If the first contestant was incorrect, the opponent automatically won the game. The winning player won money for each unconnected dot left on his/her picture, and the amount increased for each tie up to two. On the daytime series, the payout was $10 per dot and it doubled for each tie up to a maximum of $40. On the nighttime series, the payout was $100 per dot and increased by that amount for each tie, resulting in a maximum of $300 per dot. After a game was completed, usually during the middle of each episode, a \\"Home Viewer Dotto\\" game was played, in which a person selected by postcard drawing was called by telephone live on the air for a chance to guess the person being drawn. If correct, the home viewer won a new car or other valuable prizes, and if incorrect, the viewer received a consolation prize (the daytime version gave away a supply of products advertised by the show's sponsor, Colgate-Palmolive, while the nighttime version gave away a trip). At the end of each episode, additional dots were connected and a clue was displayed for the next episode's \\"Home Viewer Dotto\\" game. Broadcast history Dotto debuted on January 6, 1958 at 11:30a.m., replacing the long-running (and controversial) Warren Hull game Strike It Rich. Facing Bob Barker's Truth or Consequences on NBC and local programming on ABC (who had not programmed at 11:30 in three years), within six months Dotto became the highest-rated quiz program of the year, and Narz achieved a popularity equal to that of Hal March on The $64,000 Question. The show became so popular that on July 1 a weekly nighttime version began on NBC with the same format. On NBC's July 29 episode, a contestant on the show, actress and model Connie Hines had a telegram read on air with Columbia Pictures stating interest in her as an actress. Hines later became famous as Carol Post on the popular comedy Mister Ed. =Scandal and cancellation= Dotto's downfall began with a backstage discovery in May 1958. A notebook belonging to contestant (and later journalist) Marie Winn was found by stand- by contestant Edward Hilgemeier Jr., who realized that the notebook included questions and answers to be used during Winn's appearances, one of which was against a woman named Yaffe Kimball. He tore out the relevant pages of the notebook for himself. Hilgemeier then told Kimball after her onstage loss that her competitor had been given answers in advance. Hilgemeier later reported that Dotto's producers paid him $1,500 to keep quiet about his discovery, and Kimball, as the loser of a fixed match, $4,000. Dotto on CBS, meanwhile, grew in popularity as 1958 went on and became the highest rated Daytime show on the air. Hilgemeier eventually decided to break his silence. He contacted the Colgate-Palmolive company on approximately August 8, 1958 with his story, which was then relayed to CBS. Executives at CBS and the show's sponsor quickly moved to confirm the allegation internally and worked the issue between August 11 and 16. CBS executive vice president Thomas Fisher tested kinescopes of the show against Winn's notebook and concluded that the show looked fixed. Executives at CBS series met with its creator, Frank Cooper, concerning the potential rigging of the show on the evening of Friday, August 15. Cooper admitted that the show was indeed fixed, and CBS then reported these findings to NBC as the hosts of the nighttime version. Over the weekend of August 16, both the CBS daytime and NBC primetime series were cancelled. In the meantime, in an August 18 affidavit, Hilgemeier complained to the Federal Communications Commission (as he did to Colgate-Palmolive) that Dotto was fixed. In interviews, host Jack Narz stated that he was not notified of Dotto's cancellation until some point after the final episodes had been recorded. Narz was later subpoenaed and took a polygraph test, the results indicating that he was not connected to the fraud.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Jack Narz, 85, Genial Host of Television Game Shows, Dies\\", The New York Times, October 16, 2008. Accessed October 17, 2008. CBS immediately moved its game show Top Dollar, hosted by Warren Hull, to Dotto's 11:30a.m. time slot on Monday, August 18. A live studio audience expecting to be seated for Monday's episode of Dotto was instead set up as an audience for Top Dollar. Viewers were greeted by the opening, “Dotto, the program which normally airs at this time, will no longer be seen. Instead...welcome to Top Dollar!” The final NBC nighttime weekly episode aired on August 12, 1958; the next week its Tuesday time slot was replaced with \\"a filmed drama series\\". Dotto's cancellation on both CBS and NBC was quickly established as fact on August 18, but the reason for why it was cancelled took days to be confirmed by the media. =Aftermath= Although it was not the first show to be involved in some wrongdoing, Dotto was the first game show to have such wrongdoing verified. A year earlier, Twenty-One contestant Herb Stempel told the New York Journal- American that his run as champion on the series had been choreographed and that he had been ordered to purposely lose his championship to Charles Van Doren. Stempel's statements gained more credibility once the match fixing at Dotto was publicized, and investigations (in the form of a grand jury, and later, congressional hearings) followed. Jack Narz eventually replaced Warren Hull as host of Top Dollar by November 1958. That series ran in daytime until October 23, 1959. Narz continued to work as a game show host for most of the next twenty years after Top Dollar ended. Frank Cooper would never do another game show after Dotto, which was his longest-running game and his only one for CBS. His previous gaming efforts did not fare as well - his first game, an NBC show called Guess What Happened? (dropping the \\"Guess\\" after the first show), bombed after three episodes in 1952. Droodles, starring Roger Price, ran for three months in 1954 while ABC's Keep It in the Family ran for four months from 1957-1958. Connie Hines was revealed to have been coached for her Dotto appearance, but unlike Marie Winn, she was not given questions and answers in advance. She enjoyed a five-year run as Carol Post on Mister Ed and, after a few subsequent television guest roles, retired from acting entirely. Marie Winn eventually became a journalist whose books include The Plug-In Drug, a scathing critique on television's influence over children. The book became somewhat controversial for its author never mentioning her role in one of the medium's greatest scandals.Ken Jennings, for example, wrote: \\"Winn made her name in the 1970s by ranting against the evils of television in The Plug-In Drug. Somehow she forgot to mention that she had herself been implicated in one of the biggest scandals in TV history! It’s not in her website bio either\\" http://ken-jennings.com/blog/archives/906 =Revival= It was only in 2013 that RTBF revived the game in digitized form. In 2014, it was announced that a revival of Dotto for French Television is in the works (entitled Fizzio).Global, Hubert rework Dotto Foreign versions A version of Dotto was hugely successful in the United Kingdom, where it ran on ITV from September 13, 1958 to June 23, 1960. This version was first hosted by Robert Gladwell, followed by Jimmy Hanley and then Shaw Taylor. Each winner earned £5 for each unused dot.UK Game Shows: Dotto Episode status Although the series was presumably intact in 1958 (see above), the series is believed to have been destroyed sometime afterward as per network practices (and possibly by Colgate's insistence). Two episodes are known to exist - a daytime episode from May 20 featuring Marie Winn's victory over Yaffe Kimball-Slatin (which was subject to the rigging controversy, see above), and the third-to-last nighttime episode from July 29 featuring Connie Hines.

Originally recorded for Simon's 1965 UK-only debut, The Paul Simon Songbook, it was recorded soon after by Simon and his partner, Art Garfunkel, for the duo's third album Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme. It is generally considered a parody of American musician Bob Dylan's writing style, especially that of \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\", released on Dylan's 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home. The original version was subtitled \\"Or how I was Lyndon Johnson'd into Submission\\" in a spoken introduction at the beginning, after Simon announced the song's title. The subtitle does not appear on the sleeve or the disc label. \\"Desultory\\" means lacking in consistency, disconnected, randomhttp://www.dictionary.com/browse/desultory?s=t and a philippic is a fiery, damning speech, or tirade, delivered to condemn a particular political actor. Recording history Simon's original, solo performance found on The Paul Simon Songbook is less well known than Simon & Garfunkel's; the album remained out of print until 2004, when it was re-released by Columbia/Legacy. In early 1965, Simon was in the midst of a period in which he went back and forth between the United States and Great Britain. Eventually spending most of 1965 in Britain, he recorded The Paul Simon Songbook in London, while making a living singing at folk clubs in Britain. During this period he was also writing with Bruce Woodley of the Seekers. The album's liner notes by Judith Piepe, state of the song: \\"This is, of course, a take-off, a take-on, a private joke, but no joke is all that private or any less serious for being a joke.\\" In 1966, together with Art Garfunkel, Simon re-recorded the song for the duo's album Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme, with several changes to the lyrics. The list of names dropped is revised. When Simon complains about a man who is, \\"...so unhip, when you say Dylan he thinks you're talking about Dylan Thomas,\\" the next line in the London solo version is \\"It's all right Ma. It's just something I learned over in England,\\" referencing the Dylan songs \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" and \\"I Shall Be Free No. 10.\\" However, the Simon and Garfunkel songs says, \\"It's all right Ma. Everybody must get stoned.\\" the second part referencing the Dylan song \\"Rainy Day Women No. 12 & 35\\". There is another potential Dylan reference in the line \\"I just discovered somebody's tapped my phone,\\" possibly alluding to \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" where Dylan sings that \\"the phone's tapped anyway.\\" At the end of the 1966 recording Simon says, \\"Folk rock,\\" and, after an audible noise, \\"I've lost my harmonica, Albert.\\" This presumably refers to Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman. In the 1965 version, however, Simon sings, \\"When in London, do as I do: find yourself a friendly haiku... Go to sleep for ten or fifteen years.\\" This could be a reference to his girlfriend at that time, Kathy Chitty, whom people referred to as 'The Haiku'.

In 1992 he was appointed rector of the parish in Liege, Belgium. In 1998 he was additionally appointed rector of the parish of Maastricht. Having taken monastic vows in 1994, he was elected and consecrated an auxiliary bishop of the exarchate in 2001. From December 2002 he acted as administrator of the exarchate during the final illness of his predecessor Archbishop Serge (Konovaloff). On May 1, 2003 he was elected to lead the exarchate. His election was formally confirmed on May 3 the same year. His enthronement took place in the Cathedral of St. Alexander Nevsky in Paris on June 1, 2004. On 8 June 2006 the Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Constantinople had met and issued a statement receiving Bishop Basil of Sergievo into the Patriarchate of Constantinople - an act that caused substantial controversy, as he had not been released from the Moscow Patriarchate.See details under . The same statement gave Bishop Basil the new title, Bishop of Amphipolis (taken from an ancient see in Greece that no longer has a bishop), and charged him with the care of parishes in Great Britain and Ireland, as auxiliary bishop under Archbishop Gabriel of Komana in Paris. One day after the Council of the Archdiocese during an extraordinary meeting created the Vicariate. At that time, no such parishes existed. After his appointment a number of parishes and communities, as well as some of the clergy and laity of the Diocese of Sourozh, followed Bishop Basil into the Archdiocese and came to constitute the Episcopal Vicariate. Other parishes and communities were formed later, where none had previously existed, for example in Cumbria, and Northampton.. Bishop Basil's first liturgical service as a member of the Archdiocese was a concelebration of the Divine Liturgy with Archbishop Gabriel in the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Paris on 18 June 2006. Statutes were adopted by the Episcopal Vicariate on 23 June 2007, and the Vicariate was registered as a charity (registration number 1124252) on 29 May 2008.. Since Bishop Basil retired (on 12 October 2009) the Vicariate has become a deanery within the Archdiocese.. In January 2013 Archbishop Gabriel retired for health reasons, having been suffering from cancer, and returned to Maastricht. He died there on October 26, 2013.

When inside the nervous system, although not strictly a meningioma tumor, it is a meningeal tumor with a special aggressive behavior. It was first characterized in 1942. Histopathology Hemangiopericytomas are tumors that are derived from specialized spindle shaped cells called pericytes, which line capillaries. Diagnosis Hemangiopericytoma located in the cerebral cavity is an aggressive tumor of the mesenchyme with oval nuclei with scant cytoplasm. \\"There is dense intercellular reticulin staining. Tumor cells can be fibroblastic, myxoid, or pericytic. These tumors, in contrast to meningiomas, do not stain with epithelial membrane antigen.

It is around west of Sønderborg. It is mainly known for being the site of a famous last stand battle in 1864. During the Second Schleswig War in 1864, the Danish Army withdrew from the traditional fortified defence line, the Dannevirke (after waters and marshes which supported its flanks froze solid in a hard winter), and marched for Dybbøl to find a more defensible position. Although much artillery was abandoned and the evacuation was executed through a snow-laden north gale in winter, the army arrived almost intact. It entrenched itself at the Dybbøl Trenches, which became the scene of the siege and subsequent Battle of Dybbøl (7 April - 18 April 1864). This battle resulted in a Prussian-Austrian victory over Denmark. In the following peace settlement, Denmark surrendered Schleswig. Following World War I, Denmark recovered the northern part of Schleswig as a result of the Schleswig Plebiscites as described in the Treaty of Versailles. The Dybbøl Mill is considered a Danish national symbol.  History  Etymology = Dybbøl has gone under a myriad of names throughout history, but it is theorized to have started as Dyttis Bol; after the founder Dytti, with Bol being an old Danish word for a single farm. The name would later evolve into its first written form, Duttebul, as recorded in a Schleswig tax registry from 1352. This name would be used for many years, until the T's started to get dropped, leading to the words eventual change to Dyppell in, for example, Johannes Mejer's atlas. The name would continue to evolve in this trend, eventually changing out Bol/Bel in favour of the newer word Bøl, to finally produce Dybbøl. The town was also renamed to Düppel while under the rule of Prussia and later German Confederation and Empire, from 1864 to 1920. = Pre- War = The town of Dybbøl started as part of a larger wave of expansionism during the Viking Age in Denmark, where hundreds of new land areas were settled, both in geographic Denmark as well as its many settlements abroad in, for example, England. The first traces of human settlement in Dybbøl go back to around 4.500 BC, and the town itself is estimated to have been founded around 800 AD. The town was, during the pre-war times, quite typical of the area. Its oldest building, from around 1100 AD, is a part of the local church structure, and the local peasants were serfs tied to Sandbjerg Castle. The ownership of the castle changed hands to the Reventlow Family, which meant that the serfs in the area got to benefit from being some of the first serfs able to buy their land and become independent when Conrad Georg Reventlow started to sell his property after the Stavnsbånd was lifted. Conrad Georg was one of the first lords to do this, which makes Dybbøl home of some of the very first self-bought free peasants in Denmark. = First Schleswig War = During the First Schleswig War, Dybbøl was used as a flanking position for the Danish army in case of an attack from the south. The first battle of Dybbøl was fought on the 5. July 1848, when Prussian troops were driven back from Dybbøl by the Danish troops garrisoned there. During the month of April, there were regular skirmishes in and around the Dybbøl area, leading to the famous Dybbøl Mill being burnt down, resulting in it being out of commission for 4 years. = Interwar = During later years between the two Schleswig Wars, namely in 1861, Danish engineers began construction of Dybbøl's trench system, which was finished in 1862. The system consisted of 10 redoubts in a 3 km long half- circle that stretched from Vemmingbund to the Als Sound. The redoubts were small earthen constructions with large powder stashes of concrete, as well as wooden blockhouses for soldiers. = Second Schleswig War = As part of the Second Schleswig War, Danish forces retreating from the Danevirke arrived in Dybbøl on the 5. February. The massive influx of soldiers and officers meant that the Dybbøl Mill became a temporary military headquarter, a role that the owners of the mill (a married couple) were famously happy to fulfil, to the point of them being honoured by veterans of the later battle at their wedding anniversary a century later. On the 15. March the Prussian forces arrived to Dybbøl as part of their larger advance up Jutland. They began a month-long bombardment of the position, something they could do with impunity as they had rifled cannons, something the Danish army did not. During the bombardment, the Prussian army worked to dig their own trenches towards the Danish ones as part of their assault preparations. On the 18. April 1864, at 10:00, the Prussian army assaulted the Danish trench system. This was after 6 hours of continual bombardment, with more than 8.000 shells falling on the Danish trenches. The assault was successful, and the Danish forces had to fall back to Als. = After the war = After the Danish defeat in the Second Schleswig War, the resulting Treaty of Vienna meant that Dybbøl was now German territory as part of Prussia's conquest of the Duchy of Schleswig. After the Unification of Germany, the German Empire erected a large monument called the Düppel Denkmal, which became a tourist attraction for Germans all the way up to the First World War. The monument was later destroyed in 1945 by Danish rebels during the Nazi-German occupation of Denmark. The mill in Dybbøl became a monument for the Danish-speaking part of Dybbøl however, which was the majority at that time as well, going so far as becoming the subject of several poems by Danish poet Holger Drachmann. The German Empire also rebuilt the trench system in Dybbøl, making it much bigger and more expansive. These additional reinforcements never got to be used however, as Denmark did not participate in World War I. These newer fortifications are still visible at the Dybbøl Museum to this day. In 1914, right before the advent of WW1, the German Empire celebrated the anniversary of their victory at Als. The celebrations were held at the newly constructed trench system at Dybbøl, where about 2.000 war veterans from both Germany and Austria-Hungary attended, along with the Emperor's brother, Prince Heinrich. This would be the last German celebration in Dybbøl, as WW1 would break out shortly after. = Reunification = After the end of World War I, populations in the former Duchy of Schleswig were given the opportunity through the Versailles Treaty to vote for which country they would rather be part of; Germany (now the Weimar Republic) or Denmark. The votes resulted in the borders as they are to this day. The reunification resulted in celebration in Dybbøl, culminating in a visit by King Christian X on the 11. July 1920. A massive party was held while the king visited in the 10th redoubt in the newer German trenches. This redoubt would later become known as Kongeskansen (The Royal Redoubt). Around 50.000 people were present for the celebrations, along with the King and the entire royal Danish family. The climax of the celebrations were the handing over of an old Dannebrog to the king by a veteran of the Battle of Dybbøl. = Modern day = Dybbøl continues to be a symbol of pride in Denmark, with it often being associated with a heroic last stand, similar to the Alamo in American conscience. Because of this, the entire town and most of the surrounding area has gradually become protected area, with it being illegal to disturb the trenches, mill and surrounding area. The most notable institution in the town today is the museum, which is a popular school trip destination.  National Park status  The site is a national memorial and museum of the Battle of Dybbøl and was therefore included in the 'National Park Dybbøl Skanser,' inaugurated in 1924. This park is not included in the Danish National Park laws of 2007, but it can still use the name National Park. The area is today administered as a 'Historiecenter Dybbøl Banke' (Dybbøl Banke Museum and History Centre).What is a Danish National Park?

Their music blends psychedelia, progressive, funk, and rock. The band has played hundreds of concerts through the western United States. History and Discography The improvisational groove rock band Ten Ton Chicken has performed generously throughout the west coast since being hatched in 1998. Their inception coincided with the revitalization of the Bay Area's jam music scene at the turn of the new century. The Chicken is mostly known for their energy packed live shows featuring quirky, original songs influenced by diverse selection of music genres. The band's original line-up of; Gary Morrell (Guitar, Vocals), Rich Di Benedetto (Drums), Nick Peck (Keys, Vocals) and Eric \\"Doc\\" Kampman (Bass, Vocals), recorded the bands, seldom heard and very limited released, first LP, \\"De Cocksdorp\\" (1999). A change in the make up of Ten Ton Chicken occurred in 2001 when \\"Doc\\" left to pursue other aspects of life. With the addition of Tom Fejes (Bass, Vocals) and Jamison Smeltz (Sax, Vocals), the band's progressive roots took on a more groovy, jam rock sound. Demand for Ten Ton Chicken on Jam radio shows and on MP3 increased greatly after the release of their first two EP albums, \\"Just Like in the Old Country\\" (2002), and \\"In Search Of\\" (2003) both on the Home Grown Music Network's label, Harmonized Records. \\"Just Like in the Old Country\\" is a studio & live mix, highlighting the band's eclectic array of improvised jams. New keyboardist, Greg Sankovich, took over for Peck prior to the recording of the commercially successful, \\"In Search Of\\", which is a diverse selection of funky, bluesy, jazzy, witty, progressive rock songs. In 2006, after a short hiatus, Ten Ton Chicken reemerged on the San Francisco scene for some live performances as a newly formed quartet, with Morrell, Di Benedetto, Fejes and Smeltz carrying the feathery torch. With a new stable of originals songs, Ten Ton Chicken entered the studio to produce their, long-awaited, fourth CD, \\"Efitol\\". 2010 saw the release of Efitol. Tackling issues such as the right to say midget, the taboo love of one's second cousin, the right to elect a dope, as well as the right to be the pope, Efitol is a diverse CD of eleven wacky original songs. As of late 2010, Ten Ton Chicken has just entered the studio to begin work on their next CD, \\"The Nature of the Bleest\\".

He is best known for The Order of the Stick webcomic, for which he was ranked fifth on ComixTalk's list of the Top 25 People in Webcomics for 2007. He has also written several works for Wizards of the Coast's role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons. He owns and operates a small press publishing company, Giant in the Playground, which he formed to publish his comic work. Early life and education Burlew developed the basic elements of his stick figure art style at the age of twelve while drawing a comic called Mr. Demon for his lunchroom friends. Burlew first began playing Dungeons & Dragons in high school. He frequently assumed the role of the Game Master, a role he has likened to writing a webcomic, but his interest in the hobby lapsed until 2000 when Wizards of the Coast released the third edition ruleset for the game. Upon running his first adventure with the new rules, Burlew found that he needed several identical miniatures to represent a group of bandits. Instead of purchasing lead miniatures, he used graphic design software to draw simple stick figure cutouts in the style he had developed as a youth. He continued to use stick figure monsters for years in his D&D; sessions. Burlew attended Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, where he earned a degree in illustration. He has noted that, \\"everything [I] learned about color use or panel composition... [I] picked up at Pratt.\\" After leaving college, Burlew worked for several years as a professional graphic designer in New York, primarily working on elementary school textbook designs and layouts. CareerCareer beginnings= In 2002, Wizards of the Coast announced a contest to find a new campaign setting for their D&D; game, dubbed the Fantasy Setting Search. From a field of over eleven thousand gamers who sent in one- page descriptions of their worlds, one of Burlew's four entries was chosen as a finalist. He was asked by Wizards of the Coast to produce a one hundred-page setting bible for his world to compete against two other designers. The contest was won by Keith Baker's Eberron setting, with Burlew and P. Nathan Toomey as the other two finalists. Although he did not win the contest, the experience encouraged Burlew to pursue a career in game design. As his entry in the competition remains the unpublished property of Wizards of the Coast, Burlew is prohibited from discussing it by a non-disclosure agreement. However, he was offered additional writing work from Wizards of the Coast the following year in which he contributed monsters such as the \\"battle titan\\" and the \\"shade steel golem\\" to the Monster Manual III rulebook. Burlew was able to leverage the attention and popularity he got from the Setting Search contest into real success by launching his website \\"Giant in the Playground\\" and the comic The Order of the Stick. In June 2003, Burlew launched the website GiantITP.com in hopes of \\"turning [his] paltry name recognition into something resembling a job.\\" He dubbed his new site, Giant in the Playground, after his screen name on the Wizards.com forums in order to capitalize on his reputation as a knowledgeable gamer. =Webcomics= GiantITP.com languished for several months until Burlew added a webcomic to bring in recurring traffic. He started The Order of the Stick, a stick figure fantasy webcomic, in September 2003 by transferring the images from the stick figure miniatures he had produced for his D&D; game into a page-long comic. The Order of the Stick gained popularity through 2004. Burlew realized that he had created a successful story when several friends in an online D&D; game spent an entire session berating him for writing a scene in which a villain impales a main character. He announced the publication of the first strip compilation in December 2004. Shortly thereafter, he reported that pre-orders for the book had been so successful that he was prepared to quit his job as a graphic designer and commit himself full-time to comic and game writing. Since then, he has produced four additional compilations and three black-and-white prequels for The Order of the Stick that are not featured on the website. In November 2005, new strips of The Order of the Stick began appearing in Dragon Magazine, significantly extending the potential reach of the comic. Burlew described the feeling of seeing his work on the same page that once held the comic What's New with Phil & Dixie as \\"awe-inspiring\\" and \\"weird\\". The comic ran in the magazine until its final print issue. These strips were later published in the compilation book called Snips, Snails and Dragon Tales. Burlew also drew a short-lived webcomic for the Role-Playing Game Association (RPGA) website, Five Foot Steps, that featured more traditional cartoon art instead of stick figures. These depicted a diverse role-playing game group at the fictional Rollmoore College. The strip only lasted for five installments for reasons that have not been made public. Health issues Burlew has an undisclosed chronic illness which sometimes impedes his ability to draw comics and causes periodic delays in schedule. Due to his illness, Burlew reiterated on his website on July 10, 2011 that The Order of the Stick webcomic is produced on \\"a random schedule ... depending on [his] ability to work.\\" In September 2012, Burlew seriously injured his right hand in an accident that required emergency surgery and prevented him from drawing for an extended period. Despite physiotherapy, he has said that he does not expect to fully recover from the injury. WorksGame design credits= * Monster Manual III, Contributed.

(see 23 Code of Federal Regulations 1327 Appendix A for a complete list of violations). The records are added and maintained and deleted by the motor vehicle agency (MVA) of the state that convicted the driver or withdrew the driver's license. Checks for problem drivers When a person applies for a driver's license, either as a new applicant or as a renewing applicant in a participating state, the state MVA must check if the name is on the NDR's Problem Driver Pointer System (PDPS) (as required by federal regulation—see 23 CFR 1327.5(b)(1)). If a person has been reported to the NDR by any state as a \\"problem driver\\", the prospective licensing state must investigate the driver's history from the state that added the NDR record. Depending on the results of the investigation and the state's own laws, the prospective licensing state may be required to deny the license. Thus, this \\"PDPS check\\" enables the state MVAs to prevent someone with a suspended or revoked driver's license in one state from obtaining a driver's license in another state. The PDPS check also makes it harder for a person to obtain more than one driver's license at any one time. Not all records on the NDR are correct. Some may have been added in the past incorrectly for misdemeanor violations, such as not returning license plates in New York state. Some records may identify the wrong driver. Some records for specific convictions may have met data retention requirements and are eligible for deletion. A driver must contact the state that added the record to have that state delete an incorrect record. To find out if you have a record on NDR PDPS, see the next section. The NDR may not contain all required records. For example, a man in Pennsylvania was convicted of driving under the influence of marijuana cigarettes and crack cocaine in 1997, and was never put on the NDR. Participation by states Currently, and for the past few decades, all U.S. states participate in NDR, to avoid losing federal funding. Federal Regulation 23 CFR 1327.1 states, \\"This part provides procedures for States to participate in the National Driver Register (NDR) Problem Driver Pointer System (PDPS) and for other authorized parties to receive information from the NDR. It includes, in accordance with section 204(c) of the NDR Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-364), procedures for a State to notify the Secretary of Transportation of its intention to be bound by the requirements of section 205 of the Act (i.e., requirements for reporting by chief driver licensing officials) and for a State to notify the Secretary in the event it becomes necessary to withdraw from participation. The rule also contains the conditions for becoming a participating State as well as conditions and procedures for other authorized users of the NDR.\\" Obtaining information from NDR The following groups are authorized to receive information from the NDR: * Individuals requesting their own records under the Privacy Act of 1974 * State and federal driver's licensing officials * Federal Railroad Administration and employers of locomotive operators * Federal Aviation Administration for airman medical certification * United States Coast Guard for merchant mariner certification * National Transportation Safety Board for accident investigations * Federal Highway Administration for accident investigations * Federal agencies performing background investigations for employment * Current or prospective employers of commercial motor vehicles operators, with permission by the operator * Air carriers for pilot applicants, with permission by the applicant =Requesting your record= Under the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 and Title 23 § 1327.7, you are entitled to request a file search to see if you have a record on the NDR. As a private citizen, you must send a notarized letter commonly referred to as a \\"privacy act request\\" to the NDR indicating that you would like an NDR file check. There is no charge for this service. =Identity data sharing= According to National Drivers Register officials, problem drivers' records posted to the NDR database by the states are made available to all states in the U.S. Information supplied by one state to the NDR is obtained by another state from the NDR using the first four letters of the driver's first and last names, date of birth, and, often, if it is published, that driver's social security number and/or license number.

It was based on the Chengdu Plain, in the western Sichuan basin with some extension northeast to the upper Han River valley. To the east was the Ba tribal confederation. Further east down the Han and Yangtze rivers was the State of Chu. To the north over the Qinling Mountains was the State of Qin. To the west and south were tribal peoples of little military power. This independent Shu state was conquered by the state of Qin in 316 BC. Recent archaeological discoveries at Sanxingdui and Jinsha thought to be sites of Shu culture indicate the presence of a unique civilization in this region before the Qin conquest. In subsequent periods of Chinese history the Sichuan area continued to be referred to as Shu after this ancient state, and later states founded in the same region were also called Shu. Early independent state of Shu A bronze head with gold foil created by the inhabitants of Shu during the thirteenth or twelfth century BCE. Before 316 BC the Sichuan Basin was isolated from what was then China, which was centered in the Yellow River basin to the northeast. The discovery of Sanxingdui in 1987 was a major surprise since it indicated a major semi-Chinese culture that was previously unknown. Circa 2050-1250 BC the site of Sanxingdui 40 km north of Chengdu appears to have been the center of a fairly extensive kingdom. Objects found in two treasure pits are in a style distinct from objects found from further north. This culture is suggested by many archaeologists to be that of the Shu kingdom. There are very few mentions of Shu in the early Chinese historical records until the 4th century BC. Although there are possible references to a \\"Shu\\" in Shang Dynasty oracle bones inscriptions that indicate contact between Shu and Shang, it is not clear if the Shu mentioned refer to the kingdom in Sichuan or other different polities elsewhere. Shu was first mentioned in Shujing as one of the allies of King Wu of Zhou who helped defeated the Shang in 1046 BC at the Battle of Muye.Shujing Original text: 王曰：「嗟！我友邦塚君御事，司徒、司鄧、司空，亞旅、師氏，千夫長、百夫長，及庸，蜀、羌、髳、微、盧、彭、濮人。稱爾戈，比爾干，立爾矛，予其誓。」 However, shortly after Zhou's conquest, it was mentioned in Yizhoushu that a subordinate of King Wu led an expedition against Shu. After the battle of Muye, northern influences on Shu seem to have increased and then decreased while the Shu remained culturally distinct; archaeology suggests contacts with Shu in the late Shang and early Zhou period, but little evidence of influence from later Zhou. The expulsion of the Zhou from the Wei River valley in 771 BC probably increased Shu's isolation. A large bronze head with protruding eyes believed to be a depiction of Cancong, the semi-legendary first king of Shu Written accounts of Shu are largely a mixture of mythological stories and historical legends found in local annals and miscellaneous notes, which include the Han dynasty compilation Shuwang benji (蜀王本紀) and the Jin dynasty Chronicles of Huayang. There are a few names of semi-legendary kings, such as Cancong (蠶叢, meaning \\"silkworm-bush\\", claimed to be the founder of silkworm cultivation in Sichuan), Boguan (柏灌, \\"cypress-irrigator\\"), Yufu (魚鳧, \\"cormorant\\"), and Duyu (杜宇, \\"cuckoo\\"). According to Chronicles of Huayang, Cancong was the first of the legendary kings and had protruding eyes, while Duyu taught the people agriculture and transformed into a cuckoo after his death. In 666 BC a man from Chu called Bieling (鱉靈, meaning \\"turtle spirit\\") founded the Kaiming (開明) dynasty which lasted twelve generations until the Qin conquest. Legend has it that Bieling had died in Chu and his body floated upriver to Shu, whereupon he came back to life. While at Shu, he was successful in managing a flood and Duyu then abdicated in his favor. A later account states that the Kaiming kings occupied the far south of Shu before travelling up the Min River and taking over from Duyu. =Ba-Shu culture= As the state of Chu expanded westward up the Han and Yangtze valleys it pushed the Ba peoples west toward Shu. For the 5th and 4th centuries BC in Sichuan archaeologists speak of a mixed Ba-Shu culture, although the two peoples remained distinct. There was also some Chu influence on the Shu court. In 474 BC Shu emissaries presented gifts to the Qin court which was the first recorded contact between these two states. Later Shu troops crossed the Qinling Mountains and approached the Qin capital of Yong, and in 387 Shu and Qin troops clashed near Hanzhong on the upper Han river. Shu under Qin and HanConquest by Qin in 316 BC= Sichuan Basin before the Qin conquest, 5th century BCE About 356-338 BC Shang Yang strengthened the Qin state by centralizing it. In 337 BC Shu emissaries congratulated King Huiwen of Qin on his accession. At about this time the Stone Cattle Road was built over the mountains to connect Qin and Shu. About 316 BC the Marquis of Zu, who held part of the Stone Cattle Road, became involved with Ba and quarreled with his brother, the twelfth Kaiming King. The Marquis was defeated and fled to Ba and then to Qin. Zhang Yi proposed that Qin should ignore these barbarians and continue its eastward expansion onto the central plain. Sima Cuo proposed that Qin should use its superior army to annex Shu, develop its resources and use the added strength for a later attack eastward. Sima Cuo's proposal was accepted and both advisors were sent south as generals. The two armies met near Jaimeng on the Jialing River in Ba territory. The Kaiming king lost several battles and withdrew southward to Wuyang where he was captured and killed. Qin then turned on its allies and annexed Ba. =Qin and Han rule= In 314 BC the late Kaiming king's son was appointed Marquis Yaotong of Shu to rule in conjunction with a Qin governor. In 311 BC an official named Chen Zhuang revolted and killed Yaotong. Sima Cuo and Zhang Yi again invaded Sichuan and killed Chen Zhuang. Another Kaiming called Hui was made Marquis. In 301 BC he was involved in an intrigue and chose suicide when confronted with Sima Cuo's army. His son, Wan, the last Kaiming marquis, reigned from 300 until 285 BC when he was put to death. (Some say that An Duong Vuong in Vietnamese history was a member of the Kaiming family who led his people southward away from the Chinese.) The conquest had more than doubled Qin's territory and gave it an area safe from the other states except Chu, but the land had to be developed before its taxes could be converted into military strength. Shu was made a \\"jun\\" or commandery and became a testing ground for this type of administration. Chengdu was surrounded by an enormous wall. Land was redistributed and divided into rectangular plots. Tens of thousands of colonists were brought in from the north. Many were convicts or people displaced by the wars further north. They were marched south in columns supervised by Qin officials. The great Dujiangyan Irrigation System was begun to divert the Min River east to the Chengdu Plain. Qin intervention in Ba was less extensive, apparently to avoid alienating a warlike people on the border of Chu. During the conquest Chu was still tied up in the east with the annexation of Yue. In 312 BC Qin and Chu troops clashed on the upper Han River. Zhang Yi used a mixture of threat and bluff to block any interference from Chu. Later a Chu general named Zhuang Qiao pushed west and occupied the tribal territory south of the Yangtze south of Shu. In 281 BC Sima Cuo crossed the Yangtze and cut him off from Chu. He responded by declaring himself an independent king and he and his troops gradually blended into the local population. Starting in 280 BC or before general Bai Qi pushed down the Han River and took the Chu capital (278 BC). In 277 BC the Three Gorges area was taken. The effect was to create a new Qin frontier east of Sichuan. Sichuan remained quiescent during the wars before and after the Qin dynasty indicating the Qin policy of assimilation had been successful. Archaeological remains in Shu from this period are very similar to those of northern China, while the Ba area remained somewhat distinct. When Liu Bang launched his campaign to found the Han dynasty Sichuan was an important supply base. In 135 BC, under the expansionist Emperor Wu of Han, general Tang Meng, attempting an indirect approach to the Kingdom of Nanyue, made a push south of the Yangtze River and a little later Sima Xiangru pushed into the hill country west of Sichuan. These campaigns into tribal territory proved more expensive than they were worth and in 126 BC they were both cancelled to shift resources to the Xiongnu wars in the north. In the same year Zhang Qian returned from the west and reported that it might be possible to reach India from Sichuan. An attempt to do this was blocked by the hill tribes. In 112 BC Tang Meng resumed his expansionist wars southward. His harsh methods provoked a near mutiny in Sichuan and Sima Xiangru was brought in to enforce a more moderate policy. By this time Chinese expansion across flat agricultural country had reached a natural geographical limit. Expansion into the hill country to the south and west was much slower.

History USP was founded in 1996. The general secretary of USP is Henri Tohou who, on 19 February 1990 initiated and led with few students of the Yopougon University Campus (Abidjan), the first significant Ivorian students' uprising against President's Félix Houphouët-Boigny's regime, one of the most brutal French-sponsored dictatorships of Africa. Along with other students, they targeted the MEECI, the former national students movement from which the ruling party drew its young supporters, which was later replaced by FESCI (Federation of students and school pupils), founded in April 1990 under the leadership of Henri Tohou, Martial Ahipeaud, Azowa Beugre Amos, and Ahononga Gregoire. Following continuous unrest initiated by students of the Yopougon Campus where Tohou was living and brutal repressions from the military, especially the elite military force, the rapid intervention force of para-commandos led by the then- Commander Faizan attacked the students. Bi Sehi, Tohou, and hundreds of students fled the university campus and sought sanctuary in the cathedral Saint Paul of Plateaux-administrative center of Abidjan. They were surrounded by troops and after hours of negotiations, force was used by the military and students were taken to various military barracks where they were subjected to torture and other inhuman and degrading treatments. However, Tohou and two others escaped from the cathedral and went back to their University Campus from where, with the support of dozens of students, they went from secondary to primary schools to seek pupils' support in an attempt to transform their action into a national uprising. By midday, the city of Abidjan was full of smoke. Tohou moved to other cities of the country and the armed forces lost control of the situation. For the first time, the leader, Houphouët-Boigny, of the 30-year-old dictatorship declared that the country could accept any kind of change provided that it was done in peace and order. Underground opposition parties used that opportunity to submit their application to the ministry of interior to have their parties recognised. The country returned to multipartyism after 30 years of single party with a single radio station, TV station, and state newspaper. Henri Tohou became the national organization secretary of FESCI (Students movement) and became later Deputy Secretary of Finance as he also had other national responsibilities as National President of Youth of the Ivorian Socialist Party (PSI) which later became the PPS (Party for Progress and Socialism) and also a freelance journalist for the Côte d'Ivoire Nouvelle. Present state of affairs Since May 1996, Tohou and others have created a new political party (USP) which they also call \\"The People's Socialist Party\\". The party has been campaigning about the risk of a civil war in Côte d'Ivoire, but few Western countries paid attention to their warning. When the civil war started in Côte d'Ivoire, The USP has campaigned against the policy of a full scale war supported by the government and they proposed a political and peaceful settlement. Henri Tohou is in exile in London since 1994 and is currently working hard with members of USP worldwide to stand as the youngest candidate for the next presidential elections. The USP believes that the old politicians who brought war to their country must be replaced by a new generation of politicians not involved in the atrocities suffered by the Ivorian people. The major difficulty the USP may be facing during the next election would probably be the lack of financial power in a war-torn country where people are now living in a state of serious poverty as a result of 3 years of civil war while the other old politicians standing for the elections include two former heads of state; one a former Prime Minister, all rich enough to use their financial power during those elections. The people's socialist party has increased and strengthened its branches throughout Côte d'Ivoire, including the north and west areas currently under rebels control. The party held its convention in london between 23,24 and 25 July 2009 during which Henri Tohou, previously Secretary general of the party, has been elected President and given the power to stand for the presidential elections. A new secretary General has been appointed and he has now travelled to Abidjan to plan the campaign with local USP leaders. On 16 October 2009, the last day for submission of applications to the national electoral commission for candidates who want to run for the presidency, Henri Tohou's application was submitted to the electoral commission by his legal team and his spouse who travelled from Britain. An electoral deposit of approximately £ 30,000 was paid to the Ivorian national treasury.

There is no evidence to indicate that the Hall of Records ever existed. In 1998, Zahi Hawass, Chief Director of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, undertook excavations beneath the main body of the Sphinx at Giza and rediscovered access tunnels to several large, apparently natural, caves directly under the Sphinx. No artifacts were found and a survey was undertaken to assess any potential threats in the substrate that might affect the ancient monument above. There is no evidence artificial constructions of any kind exist or ever have existed underneath the Sphinx. Overview The story of the Hall of Records is popular among those who hold alternative theories of Ancient Egypt. The phrase \\"Hall of Records\\" originated with Edgar Cayce, an American clairvoyant, although Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince say that the idea of the existence of lost Egyptian records \\"has a long pedigree\\". Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval, in Message of the Sphinx, stated that American archaeologists and the Egyptian government had blocked investigations around the Sphinx, including attempts to locate any underground cavities.Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval, The Message of the Sphinx. Three Rivers Press; 1 edition (May 27, 1997). page 59, 71. Bauval later wrote Secret Chamber in 1999. According to Bauval, Egyptian authorities granted an American team a license to search for the Hall of Records under the Sphinx. It has been postulated that there may be three passages around the Sphinx; two with unknown origin and one is supposedly a small dead-end shaft behind the head of nineteenth-century origins. Various alternate theories on the origin of the Hall have been proposed, including that the Hall was not the work of Ancient Egyptians at all but another society such as advanced prehistoric societies or a superior race of intelligent beings. Accordingly, this original society sealed the Hall away with scrolls of their accumulated knowledge at about 10,500 BC—the last period of time when the constellation of Leo was located between the Sphinx's paws when it rose in the night sky. Cayce also stated in 1939, that the Hall of Records had a twin counterpart library that was anciently deposited on the Yucatán Peninsula somewhere by the eastern coastal temple complex sites. He mentioned that the Yucatán Depository was currently under water. The study of and the search for the Hall is considered by many academics to be pseudo-archaeology. These academics make clear distinctions between precise methodological scientific hypothesis and the rest of possible subsequent implications and speculations. In fiction The myth of the Hall of Records is featured in many creative works. * Stel Pavlou places the location of the Hall of Records beneath the Sphinx in the Atlantis adventure novel Decipher (2001). * In the X-Men: Evolution television series, the Hall of Records is located beneath the Great Sphinx and is actually a prison of the first mutant, Apocalypse. * In the Generator Rex television series, the Hall of Records is Van Kleiss's laboratory when he was sent back in time. * In Assassin's Creed Origins the Hall of Records is located beneath the Sphinx.''''

Records in 1989. With this release, Anderson attempted to move away from her previous image as a performance artist into a more musical realm. Although music had always been part of her performance, it was never brought to the fore as much as it was on Strange Angels. Anderson did more singing on this album than she did on previous albums. As a result, completion of this album was delayed for nearly a year when Anderson decided that she needed to take singing lessons; in the process she discovered that she was a soprano. The album includes contributions from vocal artist Bobby McFerrin. Its cover photo was shot by Robert Mapplethorpe, who died several months before the album's release. One of the songs on this album, \\"The Dream Before\\" (also known as \\"Hansel and Gretel Are Alive and Well\\") had been introduced several years earlier in her short film What You Mean We? while she had performed \\"Babydoll\\" and \\"The Day the Devil\\" years previously on Saturday Night Live. Reaction to Anderson's new direction was mixed, with some critics praising her new style, while some accused her of abandoning her performance art roots, even though Anderson soon began work on a major piece titled The Nerve Bible. Her next album would not be released for five years. Strange Angels received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. \\"Beautiful Red Dress\\" was covered in Portuguese by the Brazilian singer Marina Lima, on her 2006 album 'La nos Primordios', titled \\"Vestidinho Vermelho\\" (Little Red Dress). \\"The Dream Before\\" contains the iconic phrase \\"history is an angel being blown backwards into the future\\" and further references and quotes Walter Benjamin's musing on Paul Klee's painting Angelus Novus, the ninth of Benjamin's Theses on the Philosophy of History.

It is often used when describing the anatomy of humans and quadrupeds (such as horses, pigs extracted from or cattle). The anatomical reference also carries over into the description of cuts of meat from some such animals, e.g. tenderloin or sirloin steak.  Human anatomy In human anatomy the term \\"loin\\" or \\"loins\\" refers to the side of the human body below the rib cage to just above the pelvis. It is frequently used to reference the general area below the ribs. While the term \\"loin\\" is generally not used in medical science, some names of disorders do contain it. The lumbar region of the spinal column is located in the loin area of the body. Society and culture The term also has become euphemistic for human genitals because of their prominence in that anatomical region. Because of this euphemistic use of the term, the article of clothing that is worn around the genital area has been named a loincloth. In the Authorized King James Version of the Christian Bible the term \\"loins\\" is used frequently. It is suggested that the \\"loins\\" is the minimum one must cover on their body to be respectful of the law. This suggests that if a man covers up just his genital area, he is considered clothed enough for public life. Frequently the expression \\"fruit of his loins\\" is used to refer to offspring. Such a \\"fruit of my loins\\" reference is also made in the King James Version. In literature or poetry, an expression such as ‘he felt a stirring in his loins at the thought’ implies a sexual excitement. It is also used as a term for the general lower area of the body much like the term \\"below the belt\\" references the area below where the average person would wear a belt. The term \\"gird one's loins\\" was used in ancient times to describe the process of pulling up and tying the lower portion of the long outer garment between one's legs to increase one's mobility in battle or for work. In the modern age, it has become an idiom meaning to prepare oneself for action, as in: The phrase \\"his loins\\" is about four times more common in books than the phrase \\"her loins,\\" suggesting that the term \\"loins\\" has come to be associated more with men than women.  Loins in butchery  Butchers frequently refer to the section of meat below the rib cage, but above the round (in a carcass hanging from the head end) as loin. Various names of meats further butchered from the loin section of cattle and pork contain the name \\"loin\\" such as tenderloin and sirloin. In American culinary arts the loin section of meat from the top half of cattle is divided into three sections. The various cuts of beef from this section are named sirloin, tenderloin, top sirloin, and short loin. They are named for their respective parts on the cattle. In the British butchery tradition, the same set of muscles is generally referred to as the \\"rump\\". It has been suggested by culinary professionals that tenderloin is the most tender cut of beef one can get. The loin section of beef is fairly popular among consumers for its low fat qualities. It is the source of filet mignon.

In American football, blocking or interference (or running interference) involves legal movements in which one player obstructs another player's path with their body. The purpose of blocking is to prevent defensive players from tackling the ball carrier, or to protect a quarterback who is attempting to pass, hand off or run the ball. Offensive linemen and fullbacks tend to do the most blocking, although wide receivers are often asked to help block on running plays and halfbacks may be asked to help block on passing plays, while tight ends perform pass blocking and run blocking if they are not running routes to receive passes. Overall, blocking is a skill that virtually every football player may be required to do at some point, even defensive players in the event of a turnover. Essentially, blocking is pushing, with certain restrictions; in blocking one may not grasp another player or do any sort of pulling, and the hands must not extend beyond the line of each armpit; otherwise a holding penalty will be assessed. Blocking is also not permitted beyond five yards from the line of scrimmage until the quarterback has handed off the ball to a runner or a receiver has touched the ball after it has been passed. Outside sports, \\"running interference\\" is a metaphor that refers to a person's helping someone in the performance of a task without directly assisting in the task. Often this is done by attracting attention to oneself (so as to deflect attention from the other person) or throwing oneself into harm's way. Types Navy's line blocking. VietinBank =Zone blocking scheme= Zone blocking is a technique that is a simple and effective scheme for creating lanes for running plays. In a zone blocking scheme, fleet-footedness and athletic ability trump size as desirable qualities in offensive linemen. Coordination and technique matter more than muscle in implementing a successful scheme because defensive linemen are often double-teamed at the point of attack. In this blocking scheme, which takes much from the Veer blocking system, creating movement on the defensive line is more important than opening a specific hole in the defense. =Team support in zone blocking= One of the simplest reasons many teams have incorporated zone blocking in their offenses is that zone blocking rules do not change based on the defensive front. In a \\"man block\\" system, blockers are paired with defenders according to certain rules to create a running lane. If the defensive front changes, or if the defense stunts or blitzes, the blocking rules may change. This requires learning multiple rules for the same play. Zone blocking uses very consistent rules that do not change according to the defensive front. Some teams base their entire offense on it, including the NFL's Washington Football Team, New Orleans Saints, Seattle Seahawks, Kansas City Chiefs, Green Bay Packers, and Los Angeles Rams. Adopting a variation of this scheme's core principles, the West Virginia Mountaineers rely on it in the run-based spread offense, devised by former head coach Rich Rodriguez and former offensive line coach Rick Trickett, that they have used even after their departure. The University of Iowa under head coach Kirk Ferentz, a former NFL offensive line coach, utilizes zone blocking and the inside/outside stretch play as the basis for their offense. The University of Michigan also started using zone blocking under head coach Lloyd Carr in the 2006 season, and continued to do so under his successor, Rodriguez. The Carolina Panthers made the switch to zone blocking under offensive coordinator Jeff Davidson for the 2007 season. They had previously employed a man-blocking scheme for a downhill running attack under coordinator Dan Henning, but during the 2006 season, the team's undersized linemen were consistently overpowered by opposing defensive linemen. The power running game became stagnant, and especially ineffective in goal-line/short yardage situations, thus resulting in Henning's firing and the switch to zone blocking. Thanks in part to the new blocking scheme they implemented, the Panthers saw their 2008 campaign characterized by the running of DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart to great effect, gaining them play off status. That season also saw the emergence of rookie Steve Slaton with the Houston Texans under their new Alex Gibbs- designed zone blocking scheme. =Linemen techniques in zone blocking= Blocking Using a running back out of the backfield, zone plays are usually categorized into three types: Inside Zone (IZ), Outside Zone (OZ) and Stretch. These types describe the initial landmark of the ball carrier. A common approach is: Inside the tackles for IZ, just outside the tackle for OZ and just inside the last offensive player for the stretch. For each type of zone there are many different blocking schemes available: * The most basic form asks the offensive linemen to identify whether he is covered or uncovered. If uncovered, he is asked to help play-side on a double team by using wide lateral steps or even bucket steps. The resulting double team then reacts to the movement of the linemen as well as the movement of the linebacker. The initial movement of the double teams helps to equalize defensive talent and creates cutback lanes. * Another scheme asks the offensive linemen to imagine a \\"railroad track\\" parallel to the running backs path and block everything they find on their way. This could be a linebacker, but also a slanting defensive linemen from somewhere else. * Starting from either inside or outside, some offensive lines always pair two on one and use a fullback to block the remaining defender outside. This makes it necessary for the offensive linemen to use a variety of line-splits and steps. * By using a counting system some offenses try to eliminate unfavorable matchups that can be the result of unusual defensive alignment. This is often used in conjunction with other schemes. * For the outside varieties of the zone play a scheme that is called Pin&Pull; has had great success. The linemen do not step play-side, but try to \\"pin\\" a backside defensive linemen, while the next backside offensive linemen pulls around the block and up to a track to the second level. Today every NFL team uses some form of zone blocking but not all of them rely on it entirely. Cut blocking controversies The linemen of some teams that use zone blocking schemes have been criticized for their alleged penchant for cut blocking the knees of defenders, sometimes away from the play. Cut blocks are legal unless a defensive player is engaged by another offensive player. Although some consider the technique unsportsmanlike because of the risk of serious injury, when taught and applied correctly it is a very effective tactic. In fact, some defensive players employ the technique to eliminate blockers so other defenders can make the tackle. Sophisticated schemes Receiver Aaron Dobson blocking Zone blocking schemes frequently employ deception. For example, plays may be called in which blitzing defensive linemen and linebackers are permitted to rush into areas of the offensive backfield that are unimportant in the play called by the offense. Meanwhile, the offensive linemen who vacated the unimportant area migrate to the point of attack, blocking material defensive players. Role of other players Players other than offensive linemen may enhance the success of a zone blocking scheme. For example, in a run-based spread attack like West Virginia's the primary responsibility of receivers is less to catch passes than to execute downfield blocks, springing the ball carrier and extending the run.

The prohibition of interference in the rugby game stems from the game's strict enforcement of its offside rule, which prohibited any player on the team with possession of the ball to loiter between the ball and the goal. At first, American players would find creative ways of aiding the runner by pretending to accidentally knock into defenders trying to tackle the runner. Interference developed out of a practice called \\"guarding\\"; run by Princeton, wherein a player ran at each side of the runner, but not in advance. Michigan's Bennie Oosterbaan blocking, 1925. When Walter Camp witnessed this tactic being employed during a game he refereed between Harvard and Princeton in 1879, he was at first appalled, but the next year he had adopted the blocking tactics for his own team at Yale. During the 1880s and 1890s, teams developed increasingly complex blocking tactics including the interlocking interference technique known as the Flying wedge or \\"V-trick formation\\", which was first employed by Richard Hodge at Princeton in 1884 in a game against Penn, however, Princeton put the tactic aside for the next 4 years, only to revive it again in 1888 to combat the three-time All-American Yale guard Pudge Heffelfinger. Heffelfinger soon figured out how to break up the formation by leaping high in the air with his legs tucked under him, striking the V like a human cannonball. In 1892, during a game against Yale, Harvard fan and student Lorin F. Deland first introduced the flying wedge as a kickoff play. Two five man squads would line up about 25 yards behind the kicker, only to converge in a perfect flying wedge running downfield, where Harvard was able to trap the ball and hand it off to the speedy All-American Charley Brewer inside the wedge. Despite their effectiveness, the flying wedge, \\"V-trick formation\\" and other tactics which involved interlocking interference, were outlawed in 1905 through the efforts of the rule committee led by Parke H. Davis, because of its contribution to serious injury.Introduction: A Brief History of College Football Non-interlocking interference remains a basic element of modern American football, with many complex schemes being developed and implemented over the years, including zone blocking and pass blocking. Michigan running interference, 1925. The current body block technique has been attributed to one of football history's greatest head coaches: Pop Warner. Prior to his early 1900s coaching at Carlisle Indian Industrial School, blocking was done using one's shoulders. It was Warner who implemented the technique of blocking being done by hands rather than shoulders.

It lies within the City of Onkaparinga council area. The Clarendon Weir is located in the town area, on the Onkaparinga River. History Vineyards and Police Station, date unknown Clarendon bridge around 1869 The Kaurna people were the original inhabitants of the area. On 21 October 1840, Richard Blundell was granted the title to Section 801 of the Hundred of Noarlunga, after the area had been surveyed. In 1846 James Philcox purchased part of the section and subdivided it, selling the allotments and creating the town. In 1848, what remained of Section 801 was sold to Philcox's friend George Morphett, who later surveyed more allotments, and others added blocks adjacent to the town. In December 1846 the Clarendon vineyards were developed on land purchased by English benefactor William Augustine Leigh (1802–1873), one of many parcels of land bought through his agent Sir John Morphett (including two town acres between Currie and Hindley Streets in the city blocks, hence the naming of Leigh Street). A vineyard was created by 1849, probably by John or George Morphett. Edward Peake bought the winery from Leigh, built the first cottage on the site, and sold it to Joseph Gillard, who owned it for 40 years, selling most of the wine to Penfolds. The winery complex was converted into a conference centre in the 1970s. By 1866 the town was described as a regional centre \\"in the midst of a fine agricultural district, where wheat, peas, and potatoes are largely grown\\". The Clarendon area, Coromandel Valley and Kangarilla focused on orchards, market gardens and timber production in the early years, but after revised farming practices were introduced after the 1860s, vineyards were planted at Clarendon and other areas, and many wineries began producing and exporting wine. Early trade was built around local vineyards and around proximity to the Onkaparinga River, and from 1894 to 1896 the Clarendon Weir was constructed, enhancing the local economy. Heritage buildings Many buildings in Clarendon were put on the Register of the National Estate and restored over time, including the Gothic Court House and Police Station, the Bible Christian Methodist Church, the 1875 Methodist Church (now Uniting), the Oddfellows Hall and General Store.

In March 2008 she was reportedly pleased on hearing about plans for action against salvia, but saying she was not hopeful it would be fast, given that it had taken the Government two and a-half years to move on BZP.

Practical production requires roughly 35–40 MWh/ton of metal produced, which is on par with the molten salt electrolytic methods of production, though above the 7 MWh/ton theoretical minimum. Chemistry The basic chemical equation of this process is: : Si(s) \\\\+ 2 MgO(s) ↔ SiO2(s) \\\\+ 2 Mg(g) (high temperature, distillation boiling zone) Silicon and magnesia react to produce silica and magnesium. Though, according to Ellingham diagrams, this reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable, in accordance with the Le Chatelier's principle of equilibria, it can still be driven to the right by continuous supply of heat, and by removing one of the products, namely distilling out the magnesium vapor. The atmospheric pressure boiling point of magnesium metal is very low, only 1090 °C, and even lower in vacuum. Vacuum is preferred, because it allows lower temperatures. The most commonly used and cheapest form of silicon is as a ferrosilicon alloy. The iron from the alloy is but a spectator in the reactions. The magnesium raw material of this reaction is magnesium oxide, which can be obtained by several ways. In all cases the raw materials have to be calcined to remove both water and carbon dioxide, which would be gaseous at reaction temperatures, and follow the magnesium vapor around, and revert the reaction. One way is by sea or lakewater magnesium chloride hydrolyzed to hydroxide, which is then calcined to magnesium oxide by removal of water. Another way is using mined magnesite (MgCO3) that has been calcined to magnesium oxide by carbon dioxide removal. By far the most used raw material is mined dolomite, a mixed (Ca,Mg)CO3, where the calcium oxide present in the reaction zone scavenges the silica formed, releasing heat and consuming one of the products, thus helping push the equilibrium to the right. : (Ca,Mg)CO3 (s) → CaO.MgO(s)+ CO2(g) (dolomite calcining) : (Fe,Si)(s) + 2 MgO(s) ↔ Fe(s) + SiO2(s) + 2 Mg(g) : CaO + SiO2 → CaSiO3 The Pidgeon process is a batch process in which finely powdered calcined dolomite and ferrosilicon are mixed, briquetted, and charged in retorts made of nickel-chrome-steel alloy. The hot reaction zone portion of the retort is either gas fired, coal fired, or electrically heated in a furnace, while the condensing section equipped with removable baffles extends from the furnace and is water-cooled. Due to distillation, very high purity magnesium crowns are produced, which are then remelted and cast into ingots.  Carbothermic process unfeasible  The usual metallurgic use of carbon as the reducing agent instead of silicon cannot be used, because the silicon dioxide is a solid, while carbon dioxide and monoxide are both gaseous, and would follow the magnesium into the condensing zone, reverting the reaction as follows. : C(s) + MgO(s) → CO(g) + Mg(g) (high temperature, distillation boiling zone) : CO(g) + Mg(g) → C(s) + MgO(s) (low temperature, distillation condensing zone) In this case, the carbothermic reaction would produce no yield when the vapors moved into the cooler condensing zones inside the reactor, even though temporarily there would be intermediate carbon monoxide and actual magnesium vapors. There is still a feasible process with carbon, that uses shock-freezing of the vapors, to disallow any time for the reverse reaction - though such shock cooling is a far stretch from being an economical industrial process. At temperatures where the magnesium is still liquid or solid (say 600-700 °C), but carbon oxides are gaseous, the immense thermodynamic counter drive makes the reactions impractical, even if the carbon monoxide was purged away by argon, for example. The equilibrium can theoretically be driven either way, but it's impractically slow if the forward and reverse reaction rates are minuscule. At low temperatures the reaction energetics dominate everything else, and in this sense too silicon outperforms carbon, because silicon dioxide has a much larger heat of formation than the carbon oxides, as best seen in Ellingham diagrams.  Historical background  This process was invented in the early 1940s by Dr. Lloyd Montgomery Pidgeon of the Canadian National Research Council (NRC). The first plant was built in 1941 and operated by Dominion Magnesium in Haley, Ontario, Canada. This plant operated for 63 years, most recently by Timminco Metals. In the last 10 years, the Pidgeon process has come to dominate world magnesium production. China is the dominant magnesium metal supplier, relying almost exclusively on this method. The silicothermic reduction of dolomite was first developed by Dr. Amati in 1938 at the University of Padua, where his thesis is archived. Immediately afterward, an industrial production was established in Bolzano. The process used externally heated retorts identical in concept to those used by Dr. Pidgeon two years later.  World market issues  Prior to the mid-1990s the world market for magnesium metal production was dominated by electrolytic processes, with the United States as the dominant supplier. For over 80 years Dow Chemical operated a 65 kton/y capacity plant near Freeport, TX, based on seawater extracted magnesium chloride electrolysis, which was the prime magnesium metal supplier until its closure in 1998. As of 2005, there is a single US producer, in Utah, US Magnesium, a company borne from now-defunct Magcorp.MagCorp Magnesium Chloride PlantForbes.com - Magazine Article Very severe antidumping tariffs are in the process of being imposed on Chinese imports. As of 2005, the US produced about 45 out of a 615 kton/yr (7%), compared to 140 out of 311 kton/yr (45%) in 1995. In contrast, in 2005 China produced 400 out of the 615 kton/yr (65%), compared to 12 out of 311 kton/yr (4%) in 1995. The price of magnesium metal plummeted from $2300/t in 1995 to $1300/t by 2001, but recently (2004) climbed back over $2300/t, due to increased ferrosilicon, energy and transportation costs, and in anticipation of severe antidumping duties throughout the world. As stated above, the energy efficiency of thermal processes is comparable to electrolytic ones, both requiring roughly 35-40 MWh/ton. The Pidgeon method is less complex technologically, and because of distillation/vapor deposition conditions, a high purity product is easily achievable. In the past, besides the US, the other major magnesium producers have traditionally included Norsk Hydro of Norway/Canada, and to a lesser extent, the former Soviet Union countries, Brazil and France, all possessing cheap and abundant hydroelectric or nuclear electric power. A player recently stepping on the world market is Israel, while Australian company Magnesium International is planning a 100 kton/yr smelter at Sokhna in Egypt, using the Dow electrolytic process.

It is primarily known for its many beaches and idyllic costal landscape, but there are also numerous trails used for hiking and biking.Mšbius, Aaron and Michael (2014). Norwegen. DuMont Reiseverlag. Page 168. . During the Viking Age, ocean water levels were 3–4 meters higher than today. Vesterøya was therefore an island surrounded by waters, but became a peninsula as water levels decreased.Christensen, Arne Emil and Anne Stine Ingstad (1992). Osebergdronningens grav: vår arkeologiske nasjonalskatt i nytt lys. Schibsted. Page 29. . Vesterøya was previously known as Velløy, which derives from Vadill-øy.Christensen, Arne Emil and Anne Stine Ingstad (1992). Osebergdronningens grav: vår arkeologiske nasjonalskatt i nytt lys. Schibsted. Page 38. . West Island lies between the Sandefjordsfjord and Mefjord, south-east of the city center. The landscape is dominated by hills, mountains, forests, beaches, sloping rocks, and farm fields. The peninsula has a length of 10 kilometers. It is home to a large number of vacation homes, beaches, campgrounds, and recreational areas. Sea water levels were 20–25 meters higher 5,000 years ago, which means Vesterøya consisted of a large island and 25-30 minor islets. Previous names for Vesterøya include Velløy, Vælløy, Valløy, Veløyene, and Vælløynni. There are 25 km (15 mi.) of hiking trails at Vesterøya, which is an extension of the 20 km (12 mi.) coastal path at Østerøya (East Island). Combined the 45 km (28 mi.) hiking trail is part of the international North Sea Trail. West Island is home to numerous preserved areas, including Holtan Plant Preserve, the only place in Vestfold og Telemark where the species Pipsissewa (Chimaphila umbellata) occurs.https://www.fylkesmannen.no/Vestfold/Miljo-og- klima/Verneomrader/Vestfolds-verneomrader/Holtan-plantefredningsomrade/ A rest area (\\"Thomas Numme rasteplass\\") at Langeby Beach is named after TV personality Thomas Numme, who grew up on Vesterøya. Folehavna Fort Folehavna Fort at West Island's southernmost point was constructed by the Germans in 1941 during the German occupation of Norway. The surrounding area came under German control on May 8, 1941, and the fortifications were raised the same month. By the end of the war, the fort was equipped with four Belgian canons and several anti-aircraft canons. The fort was in use by German occupation forces until January 1943. It was home to numerous tunnels, including the longest which was 120 meters (394 ft.). It was also equipped with bunkers, trenches, fencing, barracks, floodlights, battlements, and minefields.Gjerseth, Simen (2016). Nye Sandefjord. Liv forlag. Page 71. . The Norwegian Armed Forces maintained control of the area until 1995 when it became a public recreation area. Bunkers, trenches, barracks, and tunnels can still be seen at Folehavna. At most about 200 German troops were stationed at Folehavna Fort. It is the southernmost point of Sandefjord which is located on the mainland (not including islands).Jøranlid, Marianne (1996). 40 trivelige turer i Sandefjord og omegn. Vett Viten. Page 54. . German forces constructed three large tunnels at Folehavna, including a 120-meter tunnel. Four 15 cm cannons were also installed in concrete gun pits on the sloping rocks.Holskjær, Lars (2017).

The fort was originally known as \\"Vesterøen\\" but was given the name Folehavna in 1943. The area was occupied by German forces in 1941 when Folehavna was owned by shipowner Anton Fredrik Klaveness. Folehavna came under the control of the Norwegian Armed Forces in May of 1945, and in July of 1950, 0.2 km2 (47 acres) was deemed an open-space area open for visitors. The Norwegian Armed Forces maintained control of the area until 1993. Although German forces at the fort were never in direct battles, they utilized Folehavna Fort to shoot down a British airplane in 1944. Today, Folehavna is used for recreational activities such as hiking, biking, and fishing. The parking lot is located 1.5 km (1 mi.) from the fort.Schandy, Tom and Tom Helgesen (2012).

It was produced in Germany between 1984 and 1995 but has continued in production in the Czech Republic. It replaced the Standard Cirrus. It was designed by Klaus Holighaus. Design and development The Discus was the first production sailplane to have a distinctive swept-back leading edge. This is now common in contemporary sailplanes. Studies had long shown that the ideal wing for minimizing induced drag should be an elliptic planform. To keep production costs down, a triple-trapezoidal approximation of this shape was adopted for the Discus. The wing section was also new. Winglets were only available towards the end of the production run, though many have been retro- fitted. The fuselage and tail were adapted from the Schempp-Hirth Ventus. A version with a narrow fuselage is called the Discus 'a' and the wider fuselage version is called the 'b'. The fuselage is made of glass-reinforced plastic around a steel tube frame. The wings and tail surfaces are also fiberglass with the exception of the main wing spar, which is made of carbon fiber. There is a water ballast tank in the fin for trimming purposes when the main wing mounted ballast tanks are in use (184 L combined) for a maximum wing-loading of =Competition use= The Discus dominated standard class sailplane racing throughout the 1980s, winning six World Gliding Championships in a row from 1985 to 1995. =Performance= The best measured glide ratio is 42.5:1. Though it is considered a high performance sailplane, its handling is well within the capabilities of inexperienced pilots. With no bad manners, powerful airbrakes and a low landing speed, the Discus is popular with clubs. Discuses are easy gliders to assemble, having light wings, automatic control hookups and a single pin securing the wings. =Production= Over 850 Discuses had been built by 2004 and it remains in production today despite the introduction of its successor, the Schempp-Hirth Discus-2.

It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 494. Lyrics The earliest record of the rhyme is in Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book, published in 1744, which noted only the first four verses. The extended version given below was not printed until c. 1770.I. Opie and P. Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 130–3. :Who killed Cock Robin? :I, said the Sparrow, :with my bow and arrow, :I killed Cock Robin. : :Who saw him die? :I, said the Fly, :with my little eye, :I saw him die. : :Who caught his blood? :I, said the Fish, :with my little dish, :I caught his blood. : :Who'll make the shroud? :I, said the Beetle, :with my thread and needle, :I'll make the shroud. : :Who'll dig his grave? :I, said the Owl, :with my little trowel, :I'll dig his grave. : :Who'll be the parson? :I, said the Rook, :with my little book, :I'll be the parson. : :Who'll be the clerk? :I, said the Lark, :if it's not in the dark, :I'll be the clerk. : :Who'll carry the link? :I, said the Linnet, :I'll fetch it in a minute, :I'll carry the link. : :Who'll be chief mourner? :I, said the Dove, :I mourn for my love, :I'll be chief mourner. : :Who'll carry the coffin? :I, said the Kite, :if it's not through the night, :I'll carry the coffin. : :Who'll bear the pall? :We, said the Wren, :both the cock and the hen, :We'll bear the pall. : :Who'll sing a psalm? :I, said the Thrush, :as she sat on a bush, :I'll sing a psalm. : :Who'll toll the bell? :I, said the Bull, :because I can pull, :I'll toll the bell. : :All the birds of the air :fell a-sighing and a-sobbing, :when they heard the bell toll :for poor Cock Robin. The rhyme has often been reprinted with illustrations, as suitable reading material for small children. The rhyme also has an alternative ending, in which the sparrow who killed Cock Robin is hanged for his crime.* Several early versions picture a stocky, strong-billed bullfinch tolling the bell, which may have been the original intention of the rhyme.M. C. Maloney, ed., English illustrated books for children: a descriptive companion to a selection from the Osborne Collection (Bodley Head, 1981), p. 31. Origin and meaning Although the song was not recorded until the mid-eighteenth century,Lockwood, W. B. \\"The Marriage of the Robin and the Wren.\\" Folklore 100.2 (1989): 237–239. there is some evidence that it is much older. The death of a robin by an arrow is depicted in a 15th-century stained glass window at Buckland Rectory, Gloucestershire,The gentry house that became the old rectory at Buckland has an impressive timbered hall that dates from the fifteenth century with two lights of contemporary stained glass in the west wall with the rebus of William Grafton and arms of Gloucester Abbey in one and the rising sun of Edward IV in the other light; birds in various attitudes hold scrolls \\"In Nomine Jesu\\"; none is reported transfixed by an arrow in Anthony Emery, Greater Medieval Houses of England and Wales, 1300–1500: Southern England, s.v. \\"Buckland Old Rectory, Gloucestershire\\", (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 80. and the rhyme is similar to a story, Phyllyp Sparowe, written by John Skelton about 1508. The use of the rhyme 'owl' with 'shovel', could suggest that it was originally used in older middle English pronunciation. Versions of the story appear to exist in other countries, including Germany. A number of the stories have been advanced to explain the meaning of the rhyme: * The rhyme records a mythological event, such as the death of the god Balder from Norse mythology, or the ritual sacrifice of a king figure, as proposed by early folklorists as in the 'Cutty Wren' theory of a 'pagan survival'.R. J. Stewart, Where is St. George? Pagan Imagery in English Folksong (1976).B. Forbes, Make Merry in Step and Song: A Seasonal Treasury of Music, Mummer's Plays & Celebrations in the English Folk Tradition (Llewellyn Worldwide, 2009), p. 5. * It is a parody of the death of King William II, who was killed by an arrow while hunting in the New Forest (Hampshire) in 1100, and who was known as William Rufus, meaning \\"red\\".J. Harrowven, The origins of rhymes, songs and sayings (Kaye & Ward, 1977), p. 92. * The rhyme is connected with the fall of Robert Walpole's government in 1742, since Robin is a diminutive form of Robert and the first printing is close to the time of the events mentioned. * According to Celtic traditions, Lugh, the sun god who dies as the nights get longer after the summer solstice, is marked in the old Celtic pictographic calendar with a bow-and-arrow shape. Lugh was the primary god representing the red sun and was also known in Welsh as “Coch Rhi Ben,” anglicised to “Cock Robin” (coch meaning red and ben meaning leader – a nod to the belief that souls became birds after death). The sparrow who kills him with “my bow and arrow” represents Brân the Blessed – the god of winter in the form of a raven. All of these theories are based on perceived similarities in the text to legendary or historical events, or on the similarities of names. Peter Opie pointed out that an existing rhyme could have been adapted to fit the circumstances of political events in the eighteenth century. The theme of Cock Robin's death as well as the poem's distinctive cadence have become archetypes, much used in literary fiction and other works of art, from poems, to murder mysteries, to cartoons.

The scattered-disc objects (SDOs) have orbital eccentricities ranging as high as 0.8, inclinations as high as 40°, and perihelia greater than . These extreme orbits are thought to be the result of gravitational \\"scattering\\" by the gas giants, and the objects continue to be subject to perturbation by the planet Neptune. Although the closest scattered- disc objects approach the Sun at about 30–35 AU, their orbits can extend well beyond 100 AU. This makes scattered objects among the coldest and most distant objects in the Solar System.Maggie Masetti. (2007). Cosmic Distance Scales – The Solar System. Website of NASA's High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center. Retrieved 2008 07-12. The innermost portion of the scattered disc overlaps with a torus-shaped region of orbiting objects traditionally called the Kuiper belt, but its outer limits reach much farther away from the Sun and farther above and below the ecliptic than the Kuiper belt proper. Because of its unstable nature, astronomers now consider the scattered disc to be the place of origin for most periodic comets in the Solar System, with the centaurs, a population of icy bodies between Jupiter and Neptune, being the intermediate stage in an object's migration from the disc to the inner Solar System. Eventually, perturbations from the giant planets send such objects towards the Sun, transforming them into periodic comets. Many objects of the proposed Oort cloud are also thought to have originated in the scattered disc. Detached objects are not sharply distinct from scattered disc objects, and some such as Sedna have sometimes been considered to be included in this group.  Discovery  Traditionally, devices like a blink comparator were used in astronomy to detect objects in the Solar System, because these objects would move between two exposures—this involved time-consuming steps like exposing and developing photographic plates or films, and people then using a blink comparator to manually detect prospective objects. During the 1980s, the use of CCD-based cameras in telescopes made it possible to directly produce electronic images that could then be readily digitized and transferred to digital images. Because the CCD captured more light than film (about 90% versus 10% of incoming light) and the blinking could now be done at an adjustable computer screen, the surveys allowed for higher throughput. A flood of new discoveries was the result: over a thousand trans-Neptunian objects were detected between 1992 and 2006. The first scattered-disc object (SDO) to be recognised as such was , originally identified in 1996 by astronomers based at Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Three more were identified by the same survey in 1999: , , and . The first object presently classified as an SDO to be discovered was , found in 1995 by Spacewatch.Schmadel, Lutz D. (2003); Dictionary of Minor Planet Names (5th rev. and enlarged ed. edition). Berlin: Springer. Page 925 (Appendix 10). Also see McFadden, Lucy-Ann; Weissman, Paul & Johnson, Torrence (1999). Encyclopedia of the Solar System. San Diego: Academic Press. Page 218. As of 2011, over 200 SDOs have been identified, including Gǃkúnǁʼhòmdímà (discovered by Schwamb, Brown, and Rabinowitz), (NEAT), Eris (Brown, Trujillo, and Rabinowitz), Sedna (Brown, Trujillo, and Rabinowitz) and (Deep Ecliptic Survey). Although the numbers of objects in the Kuiper belt and the scattered disc are hypothesized to be roughly equal, observational bias due to their greater distance means that far fewer SDOs have been observed to date.  Subdivisions of trans-Neptunian space  5:2 resonant Kuiper-belt objects Known trans-Neptunian objects are often divided into two subpopulations: the Kuiper belt and the scattered disc. A third reservoir of trans-Neptunian objects, the Oort cloud, has been hypothesized, although no confirmed direct observations of the Oort cloud have been made. Some researchers further suggest a transitional space between the scattered disc and the inner Oort cloud, populated with \\"detached objects\\". = Scattered disc versus Kuiper belt = The Kuiper belt is a relatively thick torus (or \\"doughnut\\") of space, extending from about 30 to 50 AU comprising two main populations of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs): the classical Kuiper-belt objects (or \\"cubewanos\\"), which lie in orbits untouched by Neptune, and the resonant Kuiper-belt objects; those which Neptune has locked into a precise orbital ratio such as 2:3 (the object goes around twice for every three Neptune orbits) and 1:2 (the object goes around once for every two Neptune orbits). These ratios, called orbital resonances, allow KBOs to persist in regions which Neptune's gravitational influence would otherwise have cleared out over the age of the Solar System, since the objects are never close enough to Neptune to be scattered by its gravity. Those in 2:3 resonances are known as \\"plutinos\\", because Pluto is the largest member of their group, whereas those in 1:2 resonances are known as \\"twotinos\\". In contrast to the Kuiper belt, the scattered-disc population can be disturbed by Neptune. Scattered-disc objects come within gravitational range of Neptune at their closest approaches (~30 AU) but their farthest distances reach many times that. Ongoing research suggests that the centaurs, a class of icy planetoids that orbit between Jupiter and Neptune, may simply be SDOs thrown into the inner reaches of the Solar System by Neptune, making them \\"cis-Neptunian\\" rather than trans-Neptunian scattered objects.Remo notes that Cis-Neptunian bodies \\"include terrestrial and large gaseous planets, planetary moons, asteroids, and main-belt comets within Neptune's orbit.\\" (Remo 2007) Some objects, like (29981) 1999 TD10, blur the distinction and the Minor Planet Center (MPC), which officially catalogues all trans-Neptunian objects, now lists centaurs and SDOs together. The MPC, however, makes a clear distinction between the Kuiper belt and the scattered disc, separating those objects in stable orbits (the Kuiper belt) from those in scattered orbits (the scattered disc and the centaurs). However, the difference between the Kuiper belt and the scattered disc is not clear-cut, and many astronomers see the scattered disc not as a separate population but as an outward region of the Kuiper belt. Another term used is \\"scattered Kuiper-belt object\\" (or SKBO) for bodies of the scattered disc. Morbidelli and Brown propose that the difference between objects in the Kuiper belt and scattered-disc objects is that the latter bodies \\"are transported in semi-major axis by close and distant encounters with Neptune,\\" but the former experienced no such close encounters. This delineation is inadequate (as they note) over the age of the Solar System, since bodies \\"trapped in resonances\\" could \\"pass from a scattering phase to a non-scattering phase (and vice versa) numerous times.\\" That is, trans-Neptunian objects could travel back and forth between the Kuiper belt and the scattered disc over time. Therefore, they chose instead to define the regions, rather than the objects, defining the scattered disc as \\"the region of orbital space that can be visited by bodies that have encountered Neptune\\" within the radius of a Hill sphere, and the Kuiper belt as its \\"complement ... in the a > 30 AU region\\"; the region of the Solar System populated by objects with semi-major axes greater than 30 AU. = Detached objects = The Minor Planet Center classifies the trans-Neptunian object 90377 Sedna as a scattered-disc object. Its discoverer Michael E. Brown has suggested instead that it should be considered an inner Oort-cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disc, because, with a perihelion distance of 76 AU, it is too remote to be affected by the gravitational attraction of the outer planets. Under this definition, an object with a perihelion greater than 40 AU could be classified as outside the scattered disc. Sedna is not the only such object: (discovered before Sedna) and have a perihelion too far away from Neptune to be influenced by it. This led to a discussion among astronomers about a new minor planet set, called the extended scattered disc (E-SDO). may also be an inner Oort-cloud object or (more likely) a transitional object between the scattered disc and the inner Oort cloud. More recently, these objects have been referred to as \\"detached\\", (Preprint version (pdf)) or distant detached objects (DDO). There are no clear boundaries between the scattered and detached regions. Gomes et al. define SDOs as having \\"highly eccentric orbits, perihelia beyond Neptune, and semi-major axes beyond the 1:2 resonance.\\" By this definition, all distant detached objects are SDOs. Since detached objects' orbits cannot be produced by Neptune scattering, alternative scattering mechanisms have been put forward, including a passing star or a distant, planet-sized object.. Alternative, it has been suggested that these objects have been captured from a passing star. A scheme introduced by a 2005 report from the Deep Ecliptic Survey by J. L. Elliott et al. distinguishes between two categories: scattered-near (i.e. typical SDOs) and scattered- extended (i.e. detached objects). Scattered-near objects are those whose orbits are non-resonant, non-planetary-orbit-crossing and have a Tisserand parameter (relative to Neptune) less than 3. Scattered-extended objects have a Tisserand parameter (relative to Neptune) greater than 3 and have a time- averaged eccentricity greater than 0.2. An alternative classification, introduced by B. J. Gladman, B. G. Marsden and C. Van Laerhoven in 2007, uses 10-million-year orbit integration instead of the Tisserand parameter. An object qualifies as an SDO if its orbit is not resonant, has a semi-major axis no greater than 2000 AU, and, during the integration, its semi-major axis shows an excursion of 1.5 AU or more. Gladman et al. suggest the term scattering disk object to emphasize this present mobility. If the object is not an SDO as per the above definition, but the eccentricity of its orbit is greater than 0.240, it is classified as a detached TNO. (Objects with smaller eccentricity are considered classical.) In this scheme, the disc extends from the orbit of Neptune to 2000 AU, the region referred to as the inner Oort cloud.  Orbits  Distribution of trans-Neptunian objects, with semi-major axis on the horizontal, and inclination on the vertical axis. Scattered disc objects are shown in grey, objects that are in resonance with Neptune in red. Classical Kuiper belt objects (cubewanos) and sednoids are blue and yellow, respectively. The scattered disc is a very dynamic environment. Because they are still capable of being perturbed by Neptune, SDOs' orbits are always in danger of disruption; either of being sent outward to the Oort cloud or inward into the centaur population and ultimately the Jupiter family of comets. For this reason Gladman et al. prefer to refer to the region as the scattering disc, rather than scattered. Unlike Kuiper-belt objects (KBOs), the orbits of scattered-disc objects can be inclined as much as 40° from the ecliptic. SDOs are typically characterized by orbits with medium and high eccentricities with a semi-major axis greater than 50 AU, but their perihelia bring them within influence of Neptune. Having a perihelion of roughly 30 AU is one of the defining characteristics of scattered objects, as it allows Neptune to exert its gravitational influence. The classical objects (cubewanos) are very different from the scattered objects: more than 30% of all cubewanos are on low-inclination, near-circular orbits whose eccentricities peak at 0.25. Classical objects possess eccentricities ranging from 0.2 to 0.8. Though the inclinations of scattered objects are similar to the more extreme KBOs, very few scattered objects have orbits as close to the ecliptic as much of the KBO population. Although motions in the scattered disc are random, they do tend to follow similar directions, which means that SDOs can become trapped in temporary resonances with Neptune. Examples of possible resonant orbits within the scattered disc include 1:3, 2:7, 3:11, 5:22 and 4:79.  Formation  Simulation showing Outer Planets and Kuiper Belt: a) Before Jupiter/Saturn 2:1 resonance b) Scattering of Kuiper-belt objects into the Solar System after the orbital shift of Neptune c) After ejection of Kuiper-belt bodies by Jupiter The scattered disc is still poorly understood: no model of the formation of the Kuiper belt and the scattered disc has yet been proposed that explains all their observed properties. According to contemporary models, the scattered disc formed when Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) were \\"scattered\\" into eccentric and inclined orbits by gravitational interaction with Neptune and the other outer planets. The amount of time for this process to occur remains uncertain. One hypothesis estimates a period equal to the entire age of the Solar System; a second posits that the scattering took place relatively quickly, during Neptune's early migration epoch. Models for a continuous formation throughout the age of the Solar System illustrate that at weak resonances within the Kuiper belt (such as 5:7 or 8:1), or at the boundaries of stronger resonances, objects can develop weak orbital instabilities over millions of years. The 4:7 resonance in particular has large instability. KBOs can also be shifted into unstable orbits by close passage of massive objects, or through collisions. Over time, the scattered disc would gradually form from these isolated events. Computer simulations have also suggested a more rapid and earlier formation for the scattered disc. Modern theories indicate that neither Uranus nor Neptune could have formed in situ beyond Saturn, as too little primordial matter existed at that range to produce objects of such high mass. Instead, these planets, and Saturn, may have formed closer to Jupiter, but were flung outwards during the early evolution of the Solar System, perhaps through exchanges of angular momentum with scattered objects. Once the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn shifted to a 2:1 resonance (two Jupiter orbits for each orbit of Saturn), their combined gravitational pull disrupted the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, sending Neptune into the temporary \\"chaos\\" of the proto- Kuiper belt. As Neptune traveled outward, it scattered many trans-Neptunian objects into higher and more eccentric orbits. This model states that 90% or more of the objects in the scattered disc may have been \\"promoted into these eccentric orbits by Neptune's resonances during the migration epoch...[therefore] the scattered disc might not be so scattered.\\"  Composition  The infrared spectra of both Eris and Pluto, highlighting their common methane absorption lines Scattered objects, like other trans-Neptunian objects, have low densities and are composed largely of frozen volatiles such as water and methane. Spectral analysis of selected Kuiper belt and scattered objects has revealed signatures of similar compounds. Both Pluto and Eris, for instance, show signatures for methane. Astronomers originally supposed that the entire trans-Neptunian population would show a similar red surface colour, as they were thought to have originated in the same region and subjected to the same physical processes. Specifically, SDOs were expected to have large amounts of surface methane, chemically altered into complex organic molecules by energy from the Sun. This would absorb blue light, creating a reddish hue. Most classical objects display this colour, but scattered objects do not; instead, they present a white or greyish appearance. One explanation is the exposure of whiter subsurface layers by impacts; another is that the scattered objects' greater distance from the Sun creates a composition gradient, analogous to the composition gradient of the terrestrial and gas giant planets. Michael E. Brown, discoverer of the scattered object Eris, suggests that its paler colour could be because, at its current distance from the Sun, its atmosphere of methane is frozen over its entire surface, creating an inches-thick layer of bright white ice. Pluto, conversely, being closer to the Sun, would be warm enough that methane would freeze only onto cooler, high- albedo regions, leaving low-albedo tholin-covered regions bare of ice.  Comets  Tempel 1, a Jupiter-family comet The Kuiper belt was initially thought to be the source of the Solar System's ecliptic comets. However, studies of the region since 1992 have shown that the orbits within the Kuiper belt are relatively stable, and that ecliptic comets originate from the scattered disc, where orbits are generally less stable. Comets can loosely be divided into two categories: short-period and long-period—the latter being thought to originate in the Oort cloud. The two major categories of short- period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets. Halley- type comets, which are named after their prototype, Halley's Comet, are thought to have originated in the Oort cloud but to have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, whereas the JFCs are thought to have originated in the scattered disc. The centaurs are thought to be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family. There are many differences between SDOs and JFCs, even though many of the Jupiter-family comets may have originated in the scattered disc. Although the centaurs share a reddish or neutral coloration with many SDOs, their nuclei are bluer, indicating a fundamental chemical or physical difference. One hypothesis is that comet nuclei are resurfaced as they approach the Sun by subsurface materials which subsequently bury the older material.

It follows the story of punk rock pioneers, the Sex Pistols, as they rose from their humble beginnings in London's Shepherd's Bush to their fall at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. It is considered a continuation of Temple's first documentary centered on the band, titled The Great Rock and Roll Swindle, but acts as an opportunity for the surviving members of the group to tell their side of the story. Description The Filth and the Fury is the second movie Julien Temple made about The Sex Pistols. His first effort was The Great Rock and Roll Swindle, which was released in British cinemas on 15 May 1980. This earlier effort was heavily criticised for being too skewed towards the Pistols' manager Malcolm McLaren's version of events about the band. The Filth and the Fury tells the story from the viewpoint of the band members themselves (albeit in silhouette during their contemporary interviews). The title of the film is a reference to a headline that appeared in the British tabloid newspaper The Daily Mirror on 2 December 1976 after an interview on ITV's Today presented by Bill Grundy. The title of The Daily Mirror article was itself inspired by William Faulkner's novel The Sound and the Fury which was in turn taken from a line in Shakespeare's Macbeth. Temple's documentary narrates the rise, decline and fall of the Sex Pistols from their humble beginnings in London's Shepherd's Bush to their disintegration at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. Temple puts the band into historical context with Britain's social situation in the 1970s through archival footage from the period. This film was seen in some ways as an opportunity for the Pistols to tell their perspective of the story mostly through interviews with the surviving members of the group, footage shot during the era, and outtakes from The Great Rock and Roll Swindle. Soundtrack The soundtrack to the film was released in 2002. The two-disc set contains songs by the Sex Pistols as well as music from other artists that was used in the film. ;Disc one #\\"God Save the Queen (Symphony)\\" #\\"Shang-A- Lang\\" – Bay City Rollers #\\"Pictures of Lily\\" – The Who #\\"Virginia Plain\\" – Roxy Music #\\"School's Out\\" – Alice Cooper #\\"Skinhead Moonstomp\\" – Symarip #\\"Glass of Champagne\\" – Sailor #\\"Through My Eyes\\" – The Creation #\\"The Jean Genie\\" – David Bowie #\\"I'm Eighteen\\" – Alice Cooper #\\"Submission\\" #\\"Don't Gimme No Lip Child\\" #\\"What'cha Gonna Do About It\\" #\\"Road Runner\\" #\\"Substitute\\" #\\"Seventeen\\" ;Disc two #\\"Anarchy in the UK\\" #\\"Pretty Vacant\\" #\\"Did You No Wrong\\" #\\"Liar\\" #\\"EMI\\" #\\"No Feelings\\" #\\"I Wanna Be Me\\" #\\"Way Over (In Dub)\\" – Tapper Zukie #\\"Looking for a Kiss\\" – New York Dolls #\\"Holidays in the Sun\\" #\\"No Fun\\" See also * Sid and Nancy * The Great Rock and Roll Swindle External links  The Sex Pistols on Film * Video of Bill Grundy's interview with the Sex Pistols * Sex Pistols fansite Category:2000 films Category:British documentary films Category:British films Category:Documentary films about punk music and musicians Category:English-language films Category:Film4 Productions films Category:Films directed by Julien Temple Category:Sex Pistols video albums Category:Sex Pistols compilation albums Category:2000 documentary films Category:Sex Pistols soundtracks Category:2000 compilation albums Category:2000 soundtrack albums Category:Film soundtracks ","title":"The Filth and the Fury"},{"id":"2719767","text":"A combination machine is a woodworking machine that combines the functions of two or more separate machines into a single unit. For example, a combination machine might consist of a tablesaw with a side-mounted jointer. Another common example of this type of machine is the jointer-thicknesser (also known as an over-under) which combines the function of a jointer with that of a planer. Design Some combination machines run all of their functions from a single motor; others may use more than one. Cutter heads are often shared: for example a jointer-thicknesser may use the same cutter head for both functions. The machines rely upon well thought-out designs which allow the user to switch from one function to another easily. Advantages One rationale for the production of these machines is space saving. A combination machine takes up much less space than the equivalent separate machines. Most European machines have a sliding table that tends to make them safer than typical North American table saws. Even though top end combination machines can be quite expensive, there usually is a cost saving over separate machines of similar quality. Disadvantages There are some trade offs with combination machines. Set up time is increased when moving from one function to another and back. In some cases, machine settings are lost during the change over and have to be re- established when changing back. In some lower end machines, there may be compromises in design which limit the function or robustness of the machine. Finally, they represent a single point of failure in that a mechanical problem with the machine will generally mean that none of the machine's functions are available. These disadvantages are offset by the small size of the machine footprint and potential cost saving and so they are very popular with hobbyists and workshops in which space is limited.  The Shopsmith  Shopsmith Mark V The Shopsmith is a lathe-based multi-tool that uses a single motor to perform lathe, tablesaw, sanding, and drill press functions. Variations include horizontal boring and disc sander. The original Shopsmith 10E and 10ER were invented by Dr. Hans GoldschmidtH. Goldschmidt, \\"Convertible Material Working Machine,\\" US Patent # 2,623,269, issued 30 Dec 1952. of Albany, CA, in 1947; made by the Magna America Corporation in Berkeley, CA, from 1947 to 1953; and sold by Montgomery Ward.Shopsmith Mark V Home Workshop System Owners Manual, Shopsmith Inc., Part # PL-5331, Jun 1992, p iii-v. The Mark 5J.W. Edgemond, Jr. & H. Goldschmidt, \\"Combination Wood-Working Machine,\\" US Patent # 2,927,612, issued 8 Mar 1960. debuted in 1953 but went out of production in 1964. The earliest 10E/10ER Shopsmith machines could be accompanied by optional add-ons such as a jointer, a jig saw, as well as smaller accessories allowing use as a shaper. A bandsaw was introduced in 1957 for the Mark series of machines. Magna also made the Sawsmith radial arm saw, the Mark 2 (1958-60) and the short-lived Mark VII, all compatible with the Mark V accessories. The Shopsmith Mark V was resurrected by Shopsmith Inc. in 1972 in Dayton, OH, by John Folkerth, founder and first chairman of the company. As of 2014 the machines were manufactured by RLF Brands, successor to Shopsmith Inc.. RLF Brands continues to manufacture and market a variety of add-on tools that can be run by the headstock. These tools include a bandsaw (little changed from the original 1957 version), wood shaper, jointer, belt sander, strip sander, scroll saw and thickness planer. Changes from one function to the other is usually less than 90 seconds. One of the unique features of the Shopsmith is its method of speed control. Rather than multiple pairs of pulleys or an electronic speed control, the Mark V uses a Reeves-type continuously variable transmission consisting of two variable diameter pulleys controlled by a dial and worm gear. (Standard on the Mark V, this system was optionally available on the early 10ER machines.) Not only does this give theoretically infinite speed variation between the maximum and minimum speeds, it is also simple enough to be serviced fairly easily by a hobbyist. The new (as of 2010) Shopsmith Mark 7 uses a computer-controlled motor that offers more power, greater speed range, reversibility and easy conversion to 220 V. An injury suffered by the user of a Shopsmith gave the Supreme Court of California the opportunity to create the modern rule of strict liability for defective products in 1963.See Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, 59 Cal. 2d 57 (1963). European Combination Machine Several companies in Austria, Italy, France and Belgium manufacture what is commonly known in North America as a Euro(pean) combination machine, which typically contains a sliding-table saw with a scoring blade, a shaper, a thicknesser, a jointer, and a mortiser. These machines generally have 3 motors, one for the table saw, one for the shaper, and one shared by the thickness planer/jointer and mortiser. European combination machines are geared for the serious hobbyist or professional woodworker or cabinet maker. They are constructed of cast iron and heavy gauge steel, weigh from 1000 to 2000 lbs., and range in price from around $5,000 to over $30,000 (2010, U.S. dollars). Manufacturers include Felder (Felder and Hammer brands), Kitty, Knapp, Lurem, Mini-Max, Robland, Rojek, Veba and others. Rojek and Robland manufacture entry level models, Hammer, Lurem, MiniMax and Veba mid-range models, Felder and Knapp high-end models. Robland purchased Knapp from the Metabo group in 2000. The European combination machine allows efficient processing of both rough-cut timber and sheet stock (i.e. plywood). The sliding table can work in conjunction with either the table saw or the shaper. Outfitted with an 8-foot sliding table and outrigger, a single person can cut 4'x8' plywood very accurately and efficiently. Changing between most functions takes only a few seconds. The sliding table allows a straight edge to be cut on rough lumber, without the use of a fence. It also allows a cut to be made accurately at any angle across a sheet of plywood in just seconds - something that cannot be done nearly as easily, if at all, on a table saw. Used in conjunction with the shaper, the sliding table allows molding, door panels, rails and stiles, to be milled quickly and more accurately than a stand-alone shaper.

It may also be defined as a drop-off in sexual activity two years into a long-term lesbian relationship. The concept is based on 1983 research by social psychologist Philip Blumstein and sociologist Pepper Schwartz, published in American Couples: Money, Work, Sex, which found that lesbian couples reported lower numbers when asked \\"About how often during the last year have you and your partner had sex relations?\\"Blumstein, Philip and Schwartz, Pepper (1983) American Couples: Money, Work, Sex. William Morrow The research has been criticized for its methodology and because sexual activity decreases for all long-term couples regardless of sexual orientation. Analyses of the concept have therefore regarded it as a popular myth. Origin of the term Pepper Schwartz at TEDxRainier, 2011. Pepper Schwartz is credited with coining the term lesbian bed death. Psychologist and sex therapist Suzanne Iasenza believes that it was first publicly uttered by Jade McLeughlin during a speech at a 1987 NGLTF rally at George Washington University. ResearchBlumstein and Schwartz's findings= In the early 1980s, Philip Blumstein and Pepper Schwartz conducted a survey on American relationships, sponsored by the Russell Sage Foundation and the National Science Foundation. The questionnaire covered various aspects of their relationship such as work, sex, children, finances, and decision-making. Initially 12,000 volunteer couples, including 788 lesbian couples, filled out questionnaires. Of these, 300 couples in Seattle, San Francisco, and New York were selected for a more in- depth interview. The findings were published in 1983 as American Couple: Money, Work, Sex. Among the results, Blumstein and Schwartz concluded that lesbian couples in committed relationships have less sex than any other type of couple (heterosexual married, heterosexual co-habitating or gay male) and that they generally experience less sexual intimacy the longer the relationship lasts. This was based on responses to the question \\"About how often during the last year have you and your partner had sex relations?\\" The results signified less sexual activity than their counterparts. Only about one-third of lesbians in relationships of 2 years or longer had sex once a week or more; 47% of lesbians in long-term relationships had sex once a month or less, and among heterosexual married couples, only 15% had sex once a week or less. They also reported that lesbians seemed to be more limited in the range of their sexual techniques than did other couples, and that lesbian couples are less sexual as couples and as individuals than anyone else. =Other findings and criticism= A 1988 study of over 1,500 lesbians found that 78% had been celibate at one time; 35% reported having been celibate for 1–5 years and 6% reported having been celibate for more than 6 years.Loulan, J. (1988). Research on the sex practices of 1566 lesbians and the clinical applications. Women & Therapy, 7(2-3), 221-234. In her New York Times review of American Couple, Carol Tavris suggested potential bias in the Blumstein and Schwartz survey results, as most of the respondents were typically white, affluent, liberal, and well-educated. Lesbian feminist theorist Marilyn Frye also criticized the study. Frye questioned the methodology of the survey format, feeling that the survey question is too ambiguous when applied to the sexual behavior of lesbian couples. She indicated that the survey's comparison is not accurate because the focus on sexual activity back then was on whether or not a penis was inserted and if \\"sex relations\\" is interpreted too narrowly, this ambiguity could account for the finding of a statistically low frequency of sexual behavior among lesbian couples. Frye stated, \\"...What 85 percent of long-term, married couples do more than once a month takes on average 8 minutes to do... What we (lesbians) do that, on average, we do considerably less frequently, takes, on the average, considerably more than 8 minutes to do. Maybe about 30 minutes at least.\\" Lesbian couples are expected to seek sex less frequently than heterosexual or gay male couples.Symons, D. (1981), The Evolution of Human Sexuality, Oxford University Press. Scholar Waguih William IsHak stated that although lesbian bed death lacks scientific evidence, empirical data has suggested \\"that women ha[ve] less sexual desire than men and are more submissive in sexual interactions\\". With regard to women's overall sexual behavior and sexual satisfaction, Masters and Johnson's 1979 study on lesbian sexual practices concluded that lesbian sexual behaviors more often have qualities associated with sexual satisfaction than their heterosexual counterparts, focusing on more full-body sexual contact rather than genital-focused contact, less preoccupation or anxiety about achieving orgasm, more sexual assertiveness and communication about sexual needs, longer lasting sexual encounters and greater satisfaction with the overall quality of one's sexual life. 2004 research by Margaret Nichols found slightly less sexual behavior among lesbians than heterosexual women, but that both were sexually active approximately once a week. Several studies have indicated that lesbians have orgasms more often and more easily in sexual interactions than heterosexual women do, while a 2009 Journal of Sex Research study found that women in same-sex relationships enjoyed identical sexual desire, sexual communication, sexual satisfaction, and satisfaction with orgasm as their heterosexual counterparts. 2014 research by Blair and Pukall reported that women in same-sex relationships have similar levels of overall sexual satisfaction as their heterosexual counterparts, and slightly lower levels of sexual frequency, but also that women in same-sex relationships spend significantly longer amounts of time on individual sexual encounters, often spending upwards of two hours on an individual encounter. Researchers Cohen and Byers stated that the majority of the lesbian bed research is old (by more than 20 years) and that its survey question \\"how often do you have sex?\\" is phallocentric and therefore the respondents were unlikely to include behaviors such as genital touching, oral-genital contact, and non-genital activities (such as kissing and whole-body contact) in their answers. In their 2014 study of the concept, approximately 600 women in long-term same-sex relationships were included. Three quarters had engaged in one or more genitally-based sexual activities at least once a week during the past month, and 88% of the women reported daily non-genital sexual activity. Both heterosexual and female same-sex couples had a decrease in frequency of genital contact, while non- genital contact had not decreased. The women in same-sex relationships also reported being sexually satisfied. Suzanne Iasenza described the lesbian bed death concept as a \\"notorious drop-off in sexual activity about two years into long-term lesbian relationships\\". Reviewing the literature on topic, she argued that the concept should end because it relies on gender socialization theory, lacks definitional clarity and empirical validity, and because all long-term couples experience a decline in sexual frequency as the years go on. She also stated that a 1995 Advocate Survey of Lesbian Sexuality and Relationships showed that lesbian women had more enjoyable sex than most American women, but that this data did not receive the same attention as Schwartz's study. Society and culture Following the Blumstein and Schwartz survey, many 1980s books and articles by lesbian practitioners were written about lesbian sexuality, by well-known clinicians such as Marny Hall, JoAnn Loulan and Marge Nichols, dealing with inhibited sexual desire, lack of sexual initiation and low sexual self-esteem in regards to lesbian sexuality. Nichols said that the impact \\"of these studies on the perception of lesbians, notably by lesbians themselves, was enormous: in a word, lesbians came to be seen as less sexual than other women\\". The term lesbian bed death was well-established by the early 1990s in the gay and lesbian community, and was the subject of jokes, dismay, and intense debate. Nichols stated explanations for lesbian bed death consisted of inhibited sexual desire as a result of internalized homophobia and \\"the idea of 'merging' or 'fusion' in lesbian couples (Burch, 1987). The 'urge to merge' was already stronger in women than in men, so two women in a relationship would result in an overly close connection, one so familiar that sex would come to resemble incest, thus inhibiting its expression.\\" Various scholars and writers have called lesbian bed death a myth. Nikki Dowling of The Frisky argued that the definition of sexual activity back in the 1980s was mainly limited to penile-vaginal sex, and that this has affected lesbians' definition of sex since some wonder if two women having sex is a valid act. She surmised that lesbian bed death \\"is probably only sticking around\\" due to lesbophobia. Winnie McCroy of The Village Voice stated, \\"Although [Schwartz's] methodology and results were later challenged, the idea of lesbian bed death has taken on a life of its own, with damaging results.\\" Dowling also cited a widespread negative effect of the concept, stating that numerous websites claiming they can cure lesbian bed death started to crop up. McCroy argued that all couples get tired of \\"marathon sex\\". Sex educator and author Tristan Taormino stated that sex gets old regardless of a couple's sexual orientation. Suzanne Iasenza said, \\"Read heterosexual sex therapist David Schnarch's work if you don't believe heterosexual couples grapple with similar issues.\\" Lesbian author Felice Newman stated, \\"Lesbian Bed Death is the greatest disservice we ever did to our community. [...] Because in fact the statistics don't vary that much. If you're straight or you're gay, long term relationships can be challenging when it comes to sex.\\" See also * Boston marriage * Cohabitation * Domestic partnership * Human sexuality * Queer studies * Societal attitudes toward homosexuality * U-Haul lesbian ReferencesFurther reading  * Category:Lesbian culture Category:Lesbianism Category:LGBT terminology Category:Words coined in the 1980s ","title":"Lesbian bed death"},{"id":"2719797","text":"The smooth hawksbeard, Crepis capillaris, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion tribe within the sunflower family, native to Europe.

Leander McNelly Leander Harvey McNelly (March 12, 1844 – September 4, 1877) was a Confederate officer and Texas Ranger captain. McNelly is best remembered for leading the \\"Special Force\\", a quasi-military branch of the Texas Rangers that operated in south Texas in 1875–76. Early years Leander H. McNelly was born March 12, 1844 in Follansbee, Brooke County, Virginia (today West Virginia), to P.J. McNelly and his wife Mary Downey. McNelly suffered from consumption as a child, and in 1860 his family moved to Texas in the hope that the climate would improve his health. In Texas, McNelly helped his family raise sheep and regained his health.Davis (1985), p. 103. Civil War On September 13, 1861, McNelly enlisted in the Confederate States Army, joining Company F of the Fifth Regiment of Texas Mounted Volunteers under General Thomas Green. After the Battle of Valverde during the New Mexico campaign, Green named McNelly his aide. Following fighting in the Battle of Galveston, McNelly was sent to Louisiana, where he was given a commission on December 19, 1863. He led 100 guerrilla scouts, and once carried out a spying mission dressed as a woman.Davis (1985), p. 105. McNelly and his men were tasked with capturing Brashear City, Louisiana (now Morgan City), where 800 Union troops were stationed. After dark, McNelly and his 40 troops marched back and forth across a long bridge that led to the city, shouting as if they were speaking to unseen generals and colonels. At dawn, McNelly and his small force rode into the Union camp under a flag of truce and demanded an unconditional surrender. The Union officers believed that the noise they had heard signified a very large Confederate force and surrendered immediately. McNelly was able to take all 800 Union troops prisoner. In April 1864, McNelly was wounded at the Battle of Mansfield. He took no sick leave or furlough in the entire four years of fighting, however. In the last months of the war he led mounted scouts working near Hempstead, Texas to round up deserters, and his unit was one of the last Confederate Army units to disband. Following the war, McNelly moved to Brenham, where he married and had a son and daughter. Lawman career On July 1, 1870, Governor Edmund J. Davis organized a Texas State Police force, naming McNelly one of its four captains. The new police force had an inauspicious start, as its first director promptly ran away with $34,000. Many of the officers were accused of killing prisoners and harassing voters. In his most visible job as part of the State Police, McNelly was assigned to Walker County. A Negro named Sam Jenkins had been murdered after telling a grand jury that he had been flogged. McNelly investigated the crime and arrested four men, one of whom was immediately released. The other three had smuggled weapons, and they opened fire as McNelly was returning them to jail. McNelly was wounded, and in a newspaper interview he later castigated the local sheriff for not finding the weapons. McNelly was also unhappy with Davis, who had promptly declared martial law. The State Police force was abolished on April 22, 1873.Davis (1985), p. 106. The Democratic Party regained control of Texas in 1873, and in 1874, to combat massive lawlessness, the newly elected governor, Richard Coke, created two branches of the Texas Rangers, a Frontier Battalion under the command of major John B. Jones, and a designated Special Force, commanded by McNelly, financed by cattle ranchers. McNelly's special group had the specific task of bringing order to the Nueces Strip, a hotbed of cattle thievery and banditry, where Juan Cortina, the Mexican military chief for the Rio Grande frontier, was conducting periodic guerrilla operations against the local ranchers.Davis (1985), pp. 107, 109. One of his unit's first assignments was to travel to DeWitt County and resolve the Sutton–Taylor feud. The feud had begun in March 1874 when a member of the Taylor family killed a member of the Sutton family. McNelly and 40 Rangers arrived in Clinton, Texas on August 1 and remained for four months to ensure that Taylor and the witnesses against him lived through the trial.Davis (1985), p. 107. Following that incident, McNelly was ill, and went home to recuperate on his cotton farm near Burton.Davis (1985), p. 108. There is a contemporary report that six members of McNelly's unit were engaged in a gunfight with unknown parties six miles from Clinton on the Yorktown Road, which resulted in one missing, one wounded, and two horses killed\\"The Texas Vendetta, or the Sutton-Taylor Feud\\".pp.31–32. For outcome see The Texas Rangers: Wearing the Cinco Peso, 1821–1900 By Mike Cox .p.243 Nueces Strip In April 1875, Coke ordered McNelly to organize a special force and go to Nueces County. In two days, McNelly recruited 41 men. He rejected most native Texans who had applied so that they would not have to face the possibility of shooting at their own relatives or friends. The group became very loyal to him, and called themselves the \\"Little McNellys\\". McNelly's methods had been questioned throughout the years, and although he recovered many cattle stolen from the Texan Ranches while aggressively dealing with lawlessness on the Mexican border, he had also gained a reputation of taking part in many illegal executions, and confessions forced from prisoners by extreme means. McNelly also made himself famous for disobeying direct orders from his superiors on several occasions, and breaking through the Mexican frontier for self- appointed law enforcement purposes. His actions proved to be effective, however, and he was responsible for putting an end to the troubles with Mexican bandits and cattle rustlers along the Rio Grande that were commonplace during the 1850–75 period. It was in 1875 that McNelly was faced with how to eliminate several Mexican bandit gangs. The first of these gang leaders was Juan Nepomuceno Cortina, who had been a General in the Mexican army during the Mexican–American War. For years Cortina had raided settlements in the Brownsville, Texas area, always retreating across the Rio Grande to avoid Texas law enforcement. Cortina was from a wealthy family that owned more than of land in that area, which had once included the location of the town of Brownsville. Cortina commanded a force in excess of 2,000 armed Mexican outlaws and gunmen. Further north up river, McNelly was faced with a gang led by Juan Flores Salinas. This gang did not have the manpower of the Cortina's gang, but was nonetheless as ruthless. This gang was headquartered at Camargo, Mexico, directly across the border from the US Cavalry outpost of Ringgold Barracks, near Rio Grande City. From among American outlaws, McNelly's greatest rival was Texas gunman King Fisher and his band of outlaws. Although notable as rustlers, Fisher's band rarely raided US civilian populations, concentrating more on rustling cattle from their Mexican counterparts across the border. This added to tensions among the Mexican population, and gave an excuse for Mexican bandits to raid in the United States. McNelly now moved south to end the bandit gangs that had run unchecked over that area for several years. Within one year's time, McNelly had completely destroyed both the bandit bands led by Cortina and by Salinas, by repeated actions where McNelly disobeyed orders and took his force across the border into Mexico. King Fisher's gang dispersed; Fisher went into retirement as a rancher, following a Ranger raid on his ranch during which McNelly arrested him. The two came to an agreement that Fisher's over-the-border raids would cease. Fisher later became Sheriff of Uvalde County. Palo Alto The first major gunfight between the Rangers and Mexican bandits occurred in June 1875. McNelly's Rangers surprised a group of sixteen Mexican cattle thieves and one American man, driving about 300 head of cattle toward the Rio Grande, and also toward Juan Cortina, and a steamer headed for Cuba. They were Cortina's hand- picked men, who had boasted they could cope with any Rangers or vigilantes. Captain McNelly issued his orders. \\"Don't shoot to the left or the right. Shoot straight ahead. And don't shoot till you've got your target good in your sights. Don't walk up on a wounded man. Pay no attention to a white flag. That's a mean trick bandits use on green-hands. Don't touch a dead man, except to identify him.\\" Spying the Rangers, the Mexicans took flight, driving the herd before them at a frenzied pace, until they reached a little island in the middle of a salt marsh. The Mexicans then turned and waited for the Rangers, who were right on their heels, to cross the shallow, muddy lagoon. But McNelly anticipated the ambush and stopped to issue his pep talk, \\"Boys, across this resaca are some outlaws that claim they're bigger than the law—bigger than Washington law, bigger than Texas law. This won't be a standoff or a dogfall. We'll either win completely, or we'll lose completely.\\" The battle, which has since been called the \\"Red Raid,\\" or the \\"Second Battle of the Palo Alto,\\" was waged nearly all day in a succession of single hand-fights, which left dead Mexicans and horses covering a swath through the prairie about two miles wide and six miles long. All the Mexican drovers were killed, as well as a gringo, Jack Ellis, who had beaten and mistreated a shopkeeper's wife at Nuecestown. Two hundred and sixty-five head of stolen stock were rounded up and eventually returned to their rightful owners in the neighborhood of the King Ranch country. Nine of the fourteen saddles recovered turned out to be Dick Heyes' saddles stolen in the raid on Nuecestown three months earlier. One Ranger, seventeen-year-old L. Berry Smith, who wanted to be in on the action, also died in the fighting. He was the son of camp cook, D. R. Smith and the youngest Ranger ever to die in the line of duty. Smith was apparently too inexperienced to fully appreciate McNelly's terse orders because he got too close to a wounded Mexican bandit; the bandit killed the boy before Smith even knew what was happening. Berry Smith was buried in the northwest corner of the Brownsville cemetery on June 16 with full military honors. The funeral was recorded as one of the finest the city had ever seen. The Las Cuevas War Leander McNelly's most infamous exploit was his invasion of Las Cuevas, Mexico in order to get back stolen cattle. McNelly and his Rangers entered Mexico on November 20, 1875. Under cover of brush and scrub oak, they made their way on foot to General Juan Salinas' stronghold at the Rincon de Cucharas outpost of the Las Cuevas ranch, which in English means \\"The Spoon Corner.\\" Later that afternoon, Major A. J. Alexander from Ringgold Barracks arrived with a missive from Colonel Potter at Fort Brown, on the Rio Grande at Brownsville, urging McNelly to retreat. During the gunfight, McNelly was shot through both hands. After a needed night's sleep, Captain McNelly moved his men directly opposite Camargo on the Texas side of the Rio Grande. Thus, in another invasion of Mexico, twelve or thirteen Rangers, not including McNelly – though accounts differ – crossed the river in a rowboat. McNelly marched up the riverbank to the customs house and demanded the cattle. When the Mexican Captain stalled by politely saying they didn't do business on Sunday, he promptly took the Mexican Captain prisoner, hauling him to the Texas side of the border. He told the Mexican leader to get the cattle started back to the U.S. side within the hour or he would die. The operation was successful, and instead of 250 head returning to Texas, more than 400 were crossed back. Death McNelly suffered from tuberculosis, and retired in 1876 due to a deteriorating health. He died on September 4 of the following year in Burton, Texas, survived by his wife, Carey Cheek McNelly, and two children. He is interred in Mount Zion Cemetery near Burton.McNelly LegacyIn popular culture The film Texas Rangers (2001) very loosely portrays the exploits of McNelly, who is played by actor Dylan McDermott. In the episode of the TV show \\"Tales of Wells Fargo\\" entitled \\"Sam Bass\\" (1957) the character Captain McNelly is played by Ray Teal. In the episode of the TV show Kung Fu entitled \\"Empty Pages of a Dead Book\\" (1974) actor Robert Foxworth portrays a fictionalized son of Captain McNelly, Clyde McNelly, who tracks down men who at one time were pursued by the elder McNelly.

It finds increasing use as an etchant in microelectronics. Nitrogen trifluoride is an extremely strong greenhouse gas. Synthesis and reactivity Nitrogen trifluoride is a rare example of a binary fluoride that can be prepared directly from the elements only at very uncommon conditions, such as electric discharge. After first attempting the synthesis in 1903, Otto Ruff prepared nitrogen trifluoride by the electrolysis of a molten mixture of ammonium fluoride and hydrogen fluoride. It proved to be far less reactive than the other nitrogen trihalides nitrogen trichloride, nitrogen tribromide and nitrogen triiodide, all of which are explosive. Alone among the nitrogen trihalides it has a negative enthalpy of formation. Today, it is prepared both by direct reaction of ammonia and fluorine and by a variation of Ruff's method.Philip B. Henderson, Andrew J. Woytek \\"Fluorine Compounds, Inorganic, Nitrogen\\" in Kirk‑Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 1994, John Wiley & Sons, NY. Article Online Posting Date: December 4, 2000 It is supplied in pressurized cylinders. =Reactions= NF3 is slightly soluble in water without undergoing chemical reaction. It is nonbasic with a low dipole moment of 0.2340 D. By contrast, ammonia is basic and highly polar (1.47 D). This difference arises from the fluorine atoms acting as electron withdrawing groups, attracting essentially all of the lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atom. NF3 is a potent yet sluggish oxidizer. It oxidizes hydrogen chloride to chlorine: :2 NF3 \\\\+ 6 HCl → 6 HF + N2 \\\\+ 3 Cl2 It converts to tetrafluorohydrazine upon contact with metals, but only at high temperatures: :2 NF3 \\\\+ Cu → N2F4 \\\\+ CuF2 NF3 reacts with fluorine and antimony pentafluoride to give the tetrafluoroammonium salt: : NF3 \\\\+ F2 \\\\+ SbF5 → NFSbF Applications Nitrogen trifluoride is used in the plasma etching of silicon wafers. Today nitrogen trifluoride is predominantly employed in the cleaning of the PECVD chambers in the high-volume production of liquid-crystal displays and silicon-based thin-film solar cells. In these applications NF3 is initially broken down in situ by a plasma. The resulting fluorine atoms are the active cleaning agents that attack the polysilicon, silicon nitride and silicon oxide. Nitrogen trifluoride can be used as well with tungsten silicide, and tungsten produced by CVD. NF3 has been considered as an environmentally preferable substitute for sulfur hexafluoride or perfluorocarbons such as hexafluoroethane. The process utilization of the chemicals applied in plasma processes is typically below 20%. Therefore some of the PFCs and also some of the NF3 always escape into the atmosphere. Modern gas abatement systems can decrease such emissions. F2 gas (diatomic fluorine) has been introduced as a climate neutral replacement for nitrogen trifluoride in the manufacture of flat-panel displays and thin-film solar cells. Nitrogen trifluoride is also used in hydrogen fluoride and deuterium fluoride lasers, which are types of chemical lasers. It is preferred to fluorine gas due to its convenient handling properties, reflecting its considerable stability. It is compatible with steel and Monel, as well as several plastics. Greenhouse gas Growth in atmospheric concentration of NF3 since the 1990's is shown in right graph, along with a subset of similar man-made gases. Note the log scale. is a greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential (GWP) 17,200 times greater than that of when compared over a 100-year period. Its GWP place it second only to in the group of Kyoto-recognised greenhouse gases, and was included in that grouping with effect from 2013 and the commencement of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. It has an estimated atmospheric lifetime of 740 years, although other work suggests a slightly shorter lifetime of 550 years (and a corresponding GWP of 16,800). Although has a high GWP, for a long time its radiative forcing in the Earth's atmosphere has been assumed to be small, spuriously presuming that only small quantities are released into the atmosphere. Industrial applications of routinely break it down, while in the past previously used regulated compounds such as and PFCs were often released. Research has questioned the previous assumptions. High-volume applications such as DRAM computer memory production, the manufacturing of flat panel displays and the large-scale production of thin-film solar cells use . Nitrogen trifluoride timeseries at various latitudes. Since 1992, when less than 100 tons were produced, production has grown to an estimated 4000 tons in 2007 and is projected to increase significantly. World production of NF3 is expected to reach 8000 tons a year by 2010. By far the world's largest producer of is the US industrial gas and chemical company Air Products & Chemicals. An estimated 2% of produced is released into the atmosphere. Robson projected that the maximum atmospheric concentration is less than 0.16 parts per trillion (ppt) by volume, which will provide less than 0.001 Wm−2 of IR forcing. The mean global tropospheric concentration of NF3 has risen from about 0.02 ppt (parts per trillion, dry air mole fraction) in 1980, to 0.86 ppt in 2011, with a rate of increase of 0.095 ppt yr−1, or about 11% per year, and an interhemispheric gradient that is consistent with emissions occurring overwhelmingly in the Northern Hemisphere, as expected. This rise rate in 2011 corresponds to about 1200 metric tons/y NF3 emissions globally, or about 10% of the NF3 global production estimates. This is a significantly higher percentage than has been estimated by industry, and thus strengthens the case for inventorying NF3 production and for regulating its emissions. One study co-authored by industry representatives suggests that the contribution of the NF3 emissions to the overall greenhouse gas budget of thin-film Si-solar cell manufacturing is overestimated. Instead, the contribution of the nitrogen trifluoride to the CO2-budget of thin film solar cell production is compensated already within a few months by the CO2 saving potential of the PV technology. The UNFCCC, within the context of the Kyoto Protocol, decided to include nitrogen trifluoride in the second Kyoto Protocol compliance period, which begins in 2012 and ends in either 2017 or 2020. Following suit, the WBCSD/WRI GHG Protocol is amending all of its standards (corporate, product and Scope 3) to also cover NF3. Safety Skin contact with is not hazardous, and it is a relatively minor irritant to mucous membranes and eyes. It is a pulmonary irritant with a toxicity considerably lower than nitrogen oxides, and overexposure via inhalation causes the conversion of hemoglobin in blood to methemoglobin, which can lead to the condition methemoglobinemia.

Eucharistic theology is a branch of Christian theology which treats doctrines concerning the Holy Eucharist, also commonly known as the Lord's Supper. It exists exclusively in Christianity and related religions, as others generally do not contain a Eucharistic ceremony. In the Gospel accounts of Jesus' earthly ministry, a crowd of listeners challenges him regarding the rain of manna before he delivers the famous Bread of Life Discourse (), and he describes himself as the \\"True Bread from Heaven\\".The Gospel According to John: A Literary and Theological Commentary by Thomas L. Brodie 1997 p. 266 The aforementioned Bread of Life Discourse occurs in the Gospel of John, . Therein, Jesus promises to give His Flesh and Blood, which will give eternal life to all who receive It. In John 6:53 (RSV), Jesus says, \\"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.\\" And continues, (v. 54–55) \\"he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is food indeed and my blood is drink indeed.\\" Every year, Jews in Israel celebrated the Passover Meal, remembering and celebrating their liberation from captivity in Egypt. Jesus celebrated the Last Supper with his Apostles at Passover. Saint Paul in his First Letter to the Corinthians () and the Synoptic Gospels of Matthew (), Mark (), and Luke () state that Jesus, in the course of the Last Supper on the night before his death, said: \\"This is my body\\", and \\"This is my blood\\". For instance, Matthew recounts: \\"And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body; And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.\\" The Gospel of John, on the other hand, makes no mention of this. One explanation offered is that John wrote his Gospel to supplement what the other evangelists had already written. Overview Because Jesus Christ is a person, theologies regarding the Eucharist involve consideration of the way in which the communicant's personal relationship with God is fed through this mystical meal. However, debates over Eucharistic theology in the West have centered on the metaphysical aspects of Christ's presence in this ritual. The opposing views are summarized below. =Real presence=Transubstantiation The substance (fundamental reality) of the bread and wine is changed in a way beyond human comprehension into that of the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Christ, but the accidents (physical traits, including chemical properties) of the bread and wine remain. This view is taught by the Roman Catholic Church, including its Eastern Rites.Catechism of the Catholic Church: The Sacramental Sacrifice Thanksgiving, Memorial, Presence Definitive change Eastern Orthodox Christians generally prefer not to be tied down by the specifics of the defined doctrine of transubstantiation, though they all agree with the definition's conclusion about the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. They prefer simply to use the term \\"change\\" (Greek: μεταβολή), as in the epiclesis of the Divine Liturgy, to describe the change of the bread and wine into the actual Body and Blood of Christ. (See \\"Objective reality, silence about technicalities\\", below.) The terminology of transubstantiation was adopted within the Eastern Orthodox Church by the Synod of Jerusalem (1672), although it is not recognized as having the authority of an Ecumenical Council and has been criticized for a perceived tendency toward Latinization. Consubstantiation Consubstantiation is the belief that \\"The bread retains its substance and ... Christ's glorified body comes down into the bread through the consecration and is found there together with the natural substance of the bread, without quantity but whole and complete in every part of the sacramental bread.\\" It was the position of the Lollards.Bengt Hägglund, History of Theology, Gene J. Lund, trans., (St. Louis: CPH, 1968), 194 It is erroneously used to denote the position of the Lutheran Church (see below), who instead affirm the doctrine of sacramental union. Some Anglicans identify with this position. Sacramental union In the \\"use\\" of the sacrament, according to the words of Jesus Christ and by the power of his speaking of them once for all, the consecrated bread is united with his body and the consecrated wine with his blood for all communicants, whether believing or unbelieving, to eat and drink. This is the position of the Lutheran Church that echoes the next view with its \\"pious silence about technicalities\\" in that it objects to philosophical terms like \\"consubstantiation.\\" Objective reality, silence about technicalities \\"Objective reality, but pious silence about technicalities\\" (or \\"divine [or holy] mystery\\") is the view of all the ancient Churches of the East, as well as of many Anglicans (including those of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship) and Methodists. While they agree that in the sacrament the bread and the wine are really and truly changed into the body and the blood of Christ, and while they have at times employed the terminology of \\"substance\\" to explain what is changed,\\"after the consecration of the bread and of the wine, there no longer remaineth the substance of the bread and of the wine, but the Body Itself and the Blood of the Lord, under the species and form of bread and wine; that is to say, under the accidents of the bread\\" (Confession of Dositheus , Synod of Jerusalem); \\"the word transubstantiation is not to be taken to define the manner in which the bread and wine are changed into the Body and Blood of the Lord; for this none can understand but God; but only thus much is signified, that the bread truly, really, and substantially becomes the very true Body of the Lord, and the wine the very Blood of the Lord\\" (The Longer Catechism of the Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church); the Catechism of the Eastern Orthodox Church also uses the term transubstantiation. they usually avoid this language, considering it redolent of scholasticism, as presenting speculative metaphysics as doctrine, and as scrutinizing excessively the manner in which the mystical transformation takes place. Pneumatic presence \\"Real Spiritual presence\\", also called \\"pneumatic presence\\", holds that not only the Spirit of Christ, but also the true body and blood of Jesus Christ (hence \\"real\\"), are received by the sovereign, mysterious, and miraculous power of the Holy Spirit (hence \\"spiritual\\"), but only by those partakers who have faith. This view approaches the \\"pious silence\\" view in its unwillingness to specify how the Holy Spirit makes Christ present, but positively excludes not just symbolism but also trans- and con-substantiation. It is also known as the \\"mystical presence\\" view, and is held by some Low Church Reformed Anglicans, as well as other Presbyterian Christians. This understanding is often called \\"receptionism\\". Some argue that this view can be seen as being suggested—though not clearly—by the \\"invocation\\" of the Anglican Rite as found in the American Book of Common Prayer, 1928 and earlier and in Rite I of the American BCP of 1979 as well as in other Anglican formularies: which is unchanged from the BCP of 1552 (Second Prayer-Book of Edward VI) save for modern syntax and spelling: and the inclusion of some additional words from the BCP of 1549 (First Prayer-Book of Edward VI): =Memorialism= The view known as \\"memorialism\\" is that bread and wine are symbolic of the body and blood of Jesus Christ, and in partaking of the elements the believer commemorates the sacrificial death of Christ; Christ is not present in the sacrament, except in the minds and hearts of the communicants. This view, also known as \\"Zwinglianism\\" after Huldrych Zwingli, is held by most Anabaptists and Jehovah's Witnesses. =Suspension= Suspension is the view that Jesus did not intend partaking of the bread and wine to be a perpetual ordinance, or that he did not intend it to be taken as a religious rite or ceremony (also known as adeipnonism, meaning \\"no supper\\" or \\"no meal\\"). This is the view of Quakers and the Salvation Army, as well as the hyperdispensationalist positions of E. W. Bullinger, Cornelius R. Stam, and others. Efficacy of the rite Eastern and Western eucharistic traditions generally agree with St. Augustine of Hippo in teaching that the efficacy of the sacraments as a means of divine grace does not depend on the worthiness of the priest or minister administering them. Augustine developed this concept in his controversy with the Donatists. In traditional Christianity, the efficacy and validity of the sacrament does, however, depend on properly ordained bishops and priests with a lineage from the Apostles, a doctrine called \\"apostolic succession\\". Theologies of different churchesRoman Catholic Church= Tridentine Catholic Mass In the Catholic Church, the Communion bread is fervently revered in view of the Church's doctrine that, when bread and wine are consecrated during the Eucharistic celebration, they cease to be bread and wine and become the body and blood of Christ. The empirical appearances continue to exist unchanged, but the reality is changed by the power of the Holy Spirit, Who has been called down upon the bread and wine. The separate consecrations of the bread (known as the host) and of the wine symbolizes the separation of Jesus' body from his blood at Calvary. However, since He has risen, the Church teaches that His Body and Blood are no longer actually separated. Where one is, the other must be. Therefore, although the priest (or other minister) says \\"The Body of Christ\\" when administering the host and \\"The Blood of Christ\\" when presenting the chalice, the communicant who receives either one receives Christ, whole and entire, body and blood, soul and divinity.Council of Trent, Session XIII, canon 3 ;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1390; Catholic Encyclopedia, Communion under Both Kinds This belief is succinctly summarised in St. Thomas Aquinas' hymn, Adoro Te Devote.Catholic Encyclopedia, article \\"Adoro Te Devote\\" The mysteriousThe Roman Catholic Church holds that no explanation is possible about how the change from bread and wine to the body and blood of Christ is brought about, and limits itself to teaching what is changed: \\"The signs of bread and wine become, in a way surpassing understanding, the Body and Blood of Christ\\" (Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1333, emphasis added). change of the reality of the bread and wine began to be called \\"transubstantiation\\" in the 11th century. The earliest known text in which the term appears is a sermon of 1079 by Gilbert of Savardin, Archbishop of Tours, (Patrologia Latina CLXXI 776). The first appearance of the term in a papal document was in the letter of Pope Innocent III Cum Marthae circa to John of Canterbury on 29 November 1202,Denzinger 416 then briefly in the decree Firmiter credimus of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215)Denzinger 430 and afterward in the book \\"Iamdudum\\" sent to the Armenians in the year 1341.Denzinger 544 An explanation utilizing Aristotle's hylomorphic theory of reality did not appear until the thirteenth century, with Alexander of Hales (died 1245). The actual moment of change is believed to be the priest's liturgical recitation of the Words of Institution: \\"This is my Body ...\\" and \\"This is the Chalice of my Blood ...\\". At a celebration of the Eucharist at Lourdes, the chalice is shown to the people immediately after the consecration of the wine. The Eucharist is a sacrifice in that it literally re-presents (in the sense of \\"makes present again\\") the same and only sacrifice offered once for all on the cross.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1366 The sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Eucharist are one single sacrifice. Christ, of course, is not sacrificed again because the one sacrifice of the Cross was accomplished \\"once for all\\" and cannot be repeated. The Mass is a liturgical representation of a sacrifice that makes present what it represents through the action of God in an unbloody manner.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1367 The Eucharist is not merely a commemoration of Christ's sacrifice on Golgotha: it also makes that sacrifice truly present. The priest and victim of the sacrifice are one and the same (Christ), with the difference that the Eucharist is offered in an unbloody manner.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1367; Council of Trent: Session XXII, chapter 2 The only ministers who can officiate at the Eucharist and consecrate the sacrament are ordained priests (either bishops or priestly presbyters) acting in the person of Christ (). In other words, the priest celebrant represents Christ Himself, who is the Head of the Church, and acts before God the Father in the name of the Catholic Church, always using \\"we\\" not \\"I\\" during the Eucharistic prayer . The matter used must be wheaten bread and grape wine; this is considered essential for validity.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1412; Code of Canon Law, canon 924; Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 705 Catholics may receive Holy Communion outside of Mass, normally only as the host. Consecrated hosts are kept in a tabernacle after the celebration of Mass and brought to the sick or dying during the week. A large consecrated host is sometimes displayed in a monstrance outside of Mass, to be the focus of prayer and Eucharistic adoration.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1378–1380, 1418 The Eucharistic celebration is seen as the foundation and the very centre of all Catholic devotion.Sacrosanctum Concilium, 13. Retrieved 2017-02-28. One of the seven Sacraments, it is referred to as the Blessed Sacrament, and is taught to bestow grace upon the recipient, assisting with repentance and with the avoidance of venial sin. The \\"self-offering of the believer in union with Christ\\", and the transformation of the believer into Christ which is implicit in the symnbolism, is understood as integral to the disposition needed for the fruitful reception of Communion.Catechism of the Catholic Church, Part 2,1,2,4 #1128 and Part 3,2,1,3 #2111. Reception of Communion and of the sacrament of Confession is a condition for receiving indulgences granted for some acts of piety. For fear of desecration, the Eucharist may not be received by any in a state of mortal sin, nor (generally) by non-Catholics. However, in exceptional circumstances non-Catholic Christians who share the belief of the Catholic Church in the Eucharist are permitted to receive it. =Eastern Orthodox Church= Lamb (host) and chalice during an Orthodox celebration of the Liturgy of St. James The Eucharist is at the center of Eastern Christian faith communities, both Orthodox and Eastern Catholic. Orthodox Eastern Christians affirm the real presence in the Sacred Mysteries (consecrated bread and wine) which they believe to be the actual Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. The Eucharist is normally received in the context of the Divine Liturgy. The bread and wine are believed to become the genuine Body and Blood of Christ Jesus through the operation of the Holy Spirit. The Eastern Orthodox Church has never described exactly how this occurs, or gone into the detail that the Roman Catholic Church has with the doctrine of transubstantiation. This doctrine was formulated after the Great Schism took place, and the Eastern Orthodox churches have never formally affirmed or denied it, preferring to state simply that it is a \\"Mystery\\",Ware pp. 283–285 while at the same time using, as in the 1672 Synod of Jerusalem, language that might look similar as to one that is used by the Roman Catholic Church.For instance, \\"after the consecration of the bread and of the wine, there no longer remaineth the substance of the bread and of the wine, but the Body Itself and the Blood of the Lord, under the species and form of bread and wine; that is to say, under the accidents of the bread\\" (Chapter VI of Acts and Decrees of the Synod of Jerusalem ). The Anaphora (Eucharistic prayer) contains an anamnesis (lit. \\"making present\\") which not only recounts the historical facts of Jesus' death and resurrection, but actually makes them present, forming an undivided link to the one unique event on Calvary. The Anaphora ends with an epiclesis (\\"calling down from on high\\") during which the priest invokes the Holy Spirit to come and \\"change\\" the Gifts (elements of bread and wine) into the actual Body and Blood of Christ. The Orthodox do not link the moment the Gifts change to the Words of Institution, or indeed to any one particular moment. They merely affirm that the change is completed at the Epiclesis. Communion is given only to baptized, chrismated Orthodox Christians who have prepared by fasting, prayer, and confession (different rules apply for children, elderly, sick, pregnant, etc. and are determined on a case-by-case basis by parish priests). The priest administers the Gifts with a spoon directly into the recipient's mouth from the chalice.Ware p. 287 From baptism young infants and children are carried to the chalice to receive Holy Communion.Ware p. 279 The holy gifts reserved for the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts or communion of the sick are specially consecrated as needed, especially on Holy Thursday. They are kept in an elaborately decorated tabernacle, a container on the altar often in the shape of a church or of a dove. Generally, Eastern Christians do not adore the consecrated bread outside the Liturgy itself. However, they prostrate to the ground during the transfer of the Holy Gifts during the Presanctified Liturgy (the \\"Entrance\\"), as a sign of utmost reverence. After the Eucharist has been given to the congregation, the priest or the deacon has to consume the Holy Gifts that are left. Russian icon of the Last Supper (1497) In the Orthodox Churches, the Eucharistic celebration is known as the Divine Liturgy and is believed to impart the actual Body and Blood of Christ to the faithful. In the act of communion, the entire Church—past, present, and even future—is united in eternity. In Orthodox Eucharistic theology, although many separate Divine Liturgies may be celebrated, there is only one Bread and one Cup throughout all the world and throughout all time. The most perfect expression of the Eucharistic unity of the church is found in the Hierarchical Divine Liturgy (i.e., a Liturgy at which a bishop is the chief celebrant), for as St. Ignatius of Antioch stated, where the bishop is, surrounded by his clergy and faithful, there is the church in all of her fullness. = Anglican Church = The historical position of the Church of England is found in the Thirty-Nine Articles of 1571, which state \\"the Bread which we break is a partaking of the Body of Christ\\"; and likewise that \\"the Cup of Blessing is a partaking of the Blood of Christ\\" (Articles of Religion, Article XXVIII: Of the Lord's Supper) and that \\"Transubstantiation is repugnant to Holy Writ\\". However, the Articles also state that adoration, or worship per se, of the consecrated elements was not commanded by Christ. It also stated that those who receive unworthily do not actually receive Christ but rather their own condemnation. Anglicans generally and officially believe in the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist, but the specifics of belief regarding the manner of His presence range from a belief in the corporeal presence, sometimes but not always affirming Eucharistic adoration (mainly Anglo-Catholics), to a belief in a pneumatic presence (almost always \\"Low Church\\" or Evangelical Anglicans). The normal range of Anglican belief ranges from Objective Reality to Pious Silence, depending on the individual Anglican's theology. There are also small minorities on the one hand who affirm transubstantiation or, on the other, reject the doctrine of the Real Presence altogether in favour of a pnenumatic presence. The classic Anglican aphorism with regard to this debate is found in a poem by John Donne (sometimes attributed to Elizabeth I): An imprecisely defined view known as receptionism common among 16th and 17th-century Anglican theologians is that, although in the Eucharist the bread and wine remain unchanged, the faithful communicant receives together with them the body and blood of Christ.Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 ), article \\"receptionism\\" An Anglican response concerning the Eucharistic Sacrifice (\\"Sacrifice of the Mass\\") was set forth in the response Saepius officio[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgbmxd/saepius.htm of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York to Pope Leo XIII's Papal Encyclical Apostolicae curae.http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Leo13/l13curae.htm In 1971, the Anglican and Roman Catholic International Commission announced that it had reached \\"substantial agreement on the doctrine of the Eucharist\\" in the Windsor Statement on Eucharistic Doctrine from the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Consultationhttp://www.prounione.urbe.it/dia- int/arcic/doc/e_arcic_Eucharist.html and the later (1979) Elucidation of the ARCIC Windsor Statement,http://www.prounione.urbe.it/dia- int/arcic/doc/e_arcic_elucid_euch.html but this was questioned in 1991 by the Official Roman Catholic Final Response to the ARCIC Full Report.Full text in Christopher Hill & Edward Yarnold SJ (eds.), Anglicans and Roman Catholics: The search for Unity, London.

It has also been called \\"consubstantiation\\" but most Lutheran theologians reject the use of this term as it creates confusion with an earlier doctrine of the same name.F. L. Cross, ed., The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, second edition (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1974), 340 sub loco. Some Lutherans do believe in consubstantiation.J. T.

Lueker, Christian Cyclopedia (St. Louis: CPH, 1975), under the entry \\"consubstantiation\\". Lutherans use the term \\"in, with and under the forms of consecrated bread and wine\\" and \\"sacramental union\\" to distinguish their understanding of the Eucharist from those of the Reformed and other traditions. At some American Lutheran churches (LCMS and WELS for example), closed communion is practiced (meaning the Lutheran Eucharistic catechetical instruction is required for all people before receiving the Eucharist\\"At what age do ELCA congregations allow members their first Communion?\\" Retrieved 2010-01-12.\\"Close(d) Communion\\" @ www.lcms.com). This is also practiced in many European Lutheran churches as well.Church of Sweden communion . Retrieved 2010-02-08. Other American Lutheran churches, such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, practice open communion (meaning the Eucharist is offered to adults without receiving the catechetical instruction, as long as they are a baptized Christian). The weekly Eucharist has been strongly encouraged by the bishops and priests/pastors and is now the common practice among some Lutherans. = Methodist Churches = Elder consecrates the elements Methodists understand the eucharist to be an experience of God's grace. In keeping with Wesleyan-Arminian theology, God's unconditional love makes the table of God's grace accessible to all, a concept referred to as open communion (see ). According to the \\"Article XVIII – Of the Lord's Supper\\" in the Methodist Articles of Religion: There are various acceptable modes of receiving the Eucharist for Methodists. Some Methodists kneel at communion rails, which delimit the chancel in which the altar (also called the communion table) lies. In other churches, communicants approach the minister who administers the elements in front of the chancel. Most Methodist Churches use unfermented grape juice instead of alcoholic wine (though there is no official restriction for United Methodists), and either leavened yeast bread or unleavened bread. The wine may be distributed in small cups, but the use of a common cup and the practice of communion by intinction (where the bread is dipped into the common cup and both elements are consumed together) is becoming more common among many Methodists. Methodists believe that the Lord's Supper is a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, reflecting Wesleyan covenant theology: Methodist theology affirms the real presence of Jesus Christ in Holy Communion: Methodists have typically affirmed that the sacrament of Holy Communion is an instrumental Means of Grace through which the real presence of Christ is communicated to the believer, but have otherwise allowed the details to remain a mystery. In particular, Methodists reject the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation (see Article XVIII of the Articles of Religion); the Primitive Methodist Church in its Discipline also rejects the Lollard doctrine of consubstantiation. In 2004, the United Methodist Church reaffirmed its view of the sacrament and its belief in the Real Presence in an official document entitled This Holy Mystery.https://web.archive.org/web/20041011005459/http://www.gbod.org/worship/thisholymystery/default.html Of particular note here is the Church's unequivocal recognition of the anamnesis as more than just a memorial but, rather, a re-presentation of Christ Jesus: This affirmation of Real Presence can be seen clearly illustrated in the language of the United Methodist Eucharistic Liturgyfor example: Word and Table 1 where, in the epiclesis of the Great Thanksgiving, the celebrating minister prays over the elements: Methodists, in affrming the Real Presence, assert that Jesus is really present, and that the way He is present is a \\"Holy Mystery\\"; the celebrating minister will pray for the Holy Spirit to make the elements \\"be the body and blood of Christ\\", and the congregation will sing, as in the third stanza of Charles Wesley's hymn Come Sinners to the Gospel Feast: In churches of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection, the presider says the following when he individually delivers the Eucharistic elements to each of the faithful: Methodists believe that Holy Communion should not only be available to the clergy in both forms (the bread and the wine), but to the layman as well. According to Article XIX of the Articles of Religion in the Book of Discipline of the Methodist Church, The Salvation Army, though upholding Wesleyan-Arminian theology, does not practice the sacrament of Holy Communion as it considers it to be \\"non-essential to Christian faith\\". The Sacrament Of The Sacred Moment states that \\"Salvationists have proved that the deep experience of communion with Jesus can be understood and practised without the use of the elements familiar to the various symbolic rites used in most churches\\". = Moravian Church = Nicolaus Zinzendorf, a bishop of the Moravian Church, stated that Holy Communion is the \\"most intimate of all connection with the person of the Saviour\\". The Moravian Church adheres to a view known as the \\"sacramental presence\\", teaching that in the Sacrament of Holy Communion: As with the Methodist Churches, the Moravian Church holds to the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, but does not define the precise way that He is sacramentally present. Many Moravian theologians though, believe that the Lutheran doctrine of the sacramental union properly defines the way that Christ is present in Holy Communion, and have historically promulgated that view. During the Moravian service of Holy Communion, only the scriptural words of institution are used, and thematic hymns are sung during the serving of the sacrament. The Moravian Church practices open communion. All baptized Christians who have confirmed their faith may join in Holy Communion. = Calvinism = Communion service in the Three-kings Church, Frankfurt am Main. Many Reformed Christians hold that Christ's body and blood are not corporeally (physically) present in the Eucharist, but really present in a spiritual way.Westminster Confession of Faith Ch. XXVII Sec. 7 The elements are spiritual nourishment in Christ by faith. According to John Calvin, Following a phrase of Augustine, the Calvinist view is that \\"no one bears away from this Sacrament more than is gathered with the vessel of faith\\". \\"The flesh and blood of Christ are no less truly given to the unworthy than to God's elect believers\\", Calvin said. Faith, not a mere mental apprehension, and the work of the Holy Spirit, are necessary for the partaker to behold God incarnate, and in the same sense touch Christ with their hands; so that by eating and drinking of bread and wine Christ's actual presence penetrates to the heart of the believer more nearly than food swallowed with the mouth can enter in. The 'experience' of Eucharist, or the Lord's Supper, has traditionally been spoken of in the following way: the faithful believers are 'lifted up' by the power of the Holy Spirit to feast with Christ in heaven. The Lord's Supper in this way is truly a 'Spiritual' experience as the Holy Spirit is directly involved in the action of 'eucharist'. The Calvinist/Reformed view also places great emphasis on the action of the community as the Body of Christ. As the faith community participates in the action of celebrating the Lord's Supper they are 'transformed' into the Body of Christ, or 'reformed' into the Body of Christ each time they participate in this sacrament. In this sense it has been said that the term \\"transubstantiation\\" can be applied to the Faith Community (the Church) itself being transformed into the real Body and Blood of Christ truly present in the world. Although Calvin rejected adoration of the Eucharistic bread and wine as \\"idolatry\\" later Reformed Christians have argued otherwise. Leftover elements may be disposed of without ceremony (or reused in later services); they are unchanged, and as such the meal directs attention toward Christ's bodily resurrection and return. Christians in the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. and some Christians in the United Church of Christ would reverently endorse this view. Theology in the mainline branch of this tradition is in flux, and recent agreements between these denominations and the Lutherans have stressed that: \\"The theological diversity within our common confession provides both the complementarity needed for a full and adequate witness to the gospel (mutual affirmation) and the corrective reminder that every theological approach is a partial and incomplete witness to the Gospel (mutual admonition) (A Common Calling, p. 66).\\" Hence, in seeking to come to consensus about the Real Presence, the churches have written: and further: = Presbyterian Church = According to the Presbyterian mission doctrine, the Lord's Supper is considered \\"a sacrament of continuous growth, nourishment and new life\\". In their understanding of the Reformed tradition, the participation in this sacrament should follow the sacrament of baptism. Just as humans need food and drink for nurture and sustenance, Calvin wrote that the Holy Meal of Lord's Supper is God's way of providing for the maintenance of sinful humans during the whole course of their lives after they have been received into God's family, in what Presbyterians call \\"the Covenant Community\\".David McKay – Covenant Community – ligonier.org. Retrieved December 24, 2019. Both sacraments (Baptism and Lord's Supper), according to Presbyterian theology, provide a visible and graphic way of presenting God's promises.Costen, Melva Wilson – \\"Communion – The Lord's Feast\\" – Presbyterian Mission. Retrieved December 23, 2019. The Presbyterian Church quotes the words of John Calvin \\"a testimony of divine grace toward us, confirmed by an outward sign, with mutual attestation of our piety toward [God]\\". According to them, a sacrament is a testimony of God's favor toward the church, confirmed by an outward sign, with a mutual testifying of man's godliness toward God. It is a primal physical act in the Church that signifies a spiritual relationship between personal beings. And this is what the Eucharist is in Presbyterian understanding. According to Presbyterian Eucharistic theology, there is no actual \\"transubstantiation\\" in the bread and wine, but that Jesus is spiritually present in the elements of the Eucharist, authentically present in the non-atom-based substance, with which they believe that he is con-substantial with God in the Trinity. They teach that Christ is genuinely there in the elements of the Lord's Supper to be received by them, and not just in their memories, so that it is both a memorial and a presence of Christ. They teach that receiving the Communion elements is taking the symbolic representation of the broken body and shed blood of Jesus into the inmost being, receiving the Jesus who died for our forgiveness and transformation. That humans depend on these elements for their very life and salvation. Presbyterians believe that the Word of God should be read, proclaimed and enacted in the Lord's Supper as an integral part of worship. The relationship of Word and Sacrament can be understood in the context of the Emmaus Road narrative (Luke 24:13ff). While there are various interpretations of this account, the Presbyterian Church interprets the \\"breaking of bread\\" in Luke 24 as a reference to the Lord's Supper. Many Presbyterian churches use unfermented grape juice for Communion, which is of relatively recent practice, starting in the late 19th century or in the past one hundred years, out of concern for drunkenness and also because some congregants view any alcohol as \\"sinful\\", so to accommodate their consciences grape juice is utilized in most Presbyterian churches instead. But recently some individual Presbyterian churches have gone back to using actual fermented wine as Christ used and commanded. Noting that wine in itself is not sinful, but that Christ made and drank it, etc., and that only excessive drinking of wine and actual drunkenness are wrong and sinful.Jack Lash – \\"Why Do We Use Wine in Communion?\\" Gainsevill Presbyterian Church, PCA. Retrieved December 23, 2019. The Directory for Worship in the Presbyterian Book of Order encourages the \\"appropriateness\\" of frequent celebrations of the Lord's Supper. A few Presbyterian congregations have begun celebrations of the sacrament as often as each Lord's Day (or Sunday) and on other occasions of special significance in the life of the Christian community. And also on Presbyterian liturgical seasons, such as Holy Week and Easter, the Lord's Supper is especially celebrated and observed in Presbyterian churches.\\"The Christian Year – What are the liturgical seasons?\\" PresbyterianMission.org. Retrieved January 27, 2020. But frequency alone is not the basic issue in Presbyterianism. Some believe that they need to restore the Biblical pattern of the Lord's Supper on each Sunday to provide a disciplined reminder of a divine act that will help centralize and \\"re-focus\\" the rhythm of people's daily lives. =Baptist Churches= Reformed Baptists, in agreement with Presbyterians and other Reformed Churches, hold to the doctrine of Pneumatic presence. The doctrine is articulated in the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith and the Catechism. It holds that the Lord's Supper to be a means of \\"spiritual nourishment and growth\\", stating: Independent Baptists hold to the Relational Presence. The American Baptist Churches USA, a mainline Baptist denomination, believes that \\"The bread and cup that symbolize the broken body and shed blood offered by Christ remind us today of God's great love for us\\". = Zwinglianism = Some Protestant groups regard the Eucharist (also called the Lord's Supper or the Lord's Table) as a symbolic meal, a memorial of the Last Supper and the Passion in which nothing miraculous occurs. This view is known as the Zwinglian view, after Huldrych Zwingli, a Church leader in Zurich, Switzerland during the Reformation. It is commonly associated with the United Church of Christ, Baptists, the Disciples of Christ and the Mennonites. Elements left over from the service may be discarded without any formal ceremony, or if feasible may be retained for use in future services. The successor of Zwingli in Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, came to an agreement theologically with John Calvin. The Consensus Tigurinushttps://web.archive.org/web/20091002220509/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/Tigurinus/tigur- bvd.htm lays out an explanation of the doctrine of the Sacraments in general, and specifically, that of Holy Communion, as the view embraced by John Calvin and leaders of the Church of Zurich who followed Zwingli. It demonstrates that at least the successors of Zwingli held to the real spiritual presence view most commonly attributed to Calvin and Reformed Protestantism. The Plymouth Brethren hold the Lord's Supper, or the Breaking of Bread, instituted in the upper room on Christ's betrayal night, to be the weekly remembrance feast enjoined on all true Christians. They celebrate the supper in utmost simplicity. Among \\"closed\\" Brethren assemblies usually any one of the brothers gives thanks for the loaf and the cup. In conservative \\"open\\" Brethren assemblies usually two different brothers give thanks, one for the loaf and the other for the cup. In liberal \\"open\\" Brethren assemblies (or churches/community chapels, etc.) sisters also participate with audible prayer. =Jehovah's Witnesses= The Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses views the bread and wine of the Lord's Supper as symbolically representing and commemorating the sinless body and blood of the Messiah Jesus, the Son of God. They don't consider that the elements become supernaturally altered, or that Christ's actual physical presence is literally in the bread and wine per se, but that the elements (which they generally call \\"emblems\\") are commemorative and symbolic, and are consecrated for the Lord's Supper observance, and are figurative of the body and blood of Christ, as the true \\"Lamb of God\\" who died once for all, and view the celebration as an anti- typical fulfillment of the ancient Jewish Passover celebration, which memorialized the freeing and rescuing of God's covenant people Israel from painful bondage to sinful Egypt. The Witnesses commemorate Christ's death as a ransom or propitiatory sacrifice by observing a Memorial annually on the evening that corresponds to the Passover,Reasoning From The Scriptures, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1989, p. 265. Nisan 14, according to the ancient Jewish calendar.Insight On The Scriptures, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1988, p. 392. They refer to this observance generally as \\"the Lord's Evening Meal\\" or the \\"Memorial of Christ's Death\\", taken from Jesus' words to his Apostles \\"do this as a memorial of me\\" (Luke 22:19).Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers – Luke 22 \\"This do in remembrance of me.—Literally, as My memorial, or, as your memorial of Me.\\" – Retrieved October 18, 2019. They believe that this is the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians in the Bible.\\"Jehovah is a God of Covenants\\", The Watchtower, February 1, 1998, p. 8, \\"Jesus instituted the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians—the Memorial of his death.\\" Of those who attend the Memorial a small minority worldwide partake of the wine and unleavened bread. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that only 144,000 people will receive heavenly salvation and immortal life and thus spend eternity with God and Christ in heaven, with glorified bodies, as under-priests and co-rulers under Christ the King and High Priest, in Jehovah's Kingdom. Paralleling the anointing of kings and priests, they are referred to as the \\"anointed\\" class and are the only ones who should partake of the bread and wine. They believe that the baptized \\"other sheep\\" of Christ's flock, or the \\"great crowd\\", also benefit from the ransom sacrifice, and are respectful observers and viewers of the Lord's Supper remembrance at these special meetings of Jehovah's witnesses, with hope of receiving salvation, through Christ's atoning sacrifice, which is memorialized by the Lord's Evening Meal, and with the hope of obtaining everlasting life in Paradise restored on a prophesied \\"New Earth\\", under Christ as Redeemer and Ruler. The Memorial, held after sundown, includes a sermon on the meaning and importance of the celebration and gathering, and includes the circulation and viewing among the audience of unadulterated red wine and unleavened bread (matzo). Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the bread symbolizes and represents Jesus Christ's perfect body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine represents his perfect blood which he shed at Calvary and redeems fallen man from inherited sin and death. The wine and the bread (sometimes referred to as \\"emblems\\") are viewed as symbolic and commemorative; the Witnesses do not believe in transubstantiation or consubstantiation; so not a literal presence of flesh and blood in the emblems, but that the emblems are simply sacred symbolisms and representations, denoting what was used in the first Lord's Supper, and which figuratively represent the ransom sacrifice of Jesus and sacred realities.\\"Discerning What We Are – At Memorial Time\\", The Watchtower, February 15, 1990, p. 16. =Quakers= Quakers' Eucharistic theology is Memorialism: \\"The bread and wine remind us of Jesus' body and blood.\\" However, they also hold to suspension: they do not practice Holy Communion in their worship, believing it was not meant to be a perpetually mandated ritual. Nonetheless, Quakers understand all of life as being sacramental: \\"We believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit and in communion with that Spirit. If the believer experiences such spiritual baptism and communion, then no rite or ritual is necessary. ... The Quaker ideal is to make every meal at every table a Lord's Supper.\\" = Latter Day Saint movement = Among Latter Day Saints (or Mormons), the Eucharist (in LDS theology it is \\"The Sacrament\\") is partaken in remembrance of the blood and body of Jesus Christ. It is viewed as a renewal of the covenant made at baptism, which is to take upon oneself the name of Jesus. As such, it is considered efficacious only for baptized members in good standing. However, the unbaptized are not forbidden from communion, and it is traditional for children not yet baptized (baptism occurs only after the age of eight) to participate in communion in anticipation of baptism. Those who partake of the Sacrament promise always to remember Jesus and keep his commandments. The prayer also asks God the Father that each individual will be blessed with the Spirit of Christ. (see also , ) The Sacrament is offered weekly and all active members are taught to prepare to partake of each opportunity. It is considered to be a weekly renewal of a member's commitment to follow Jesus Christ, and a plea for forgiveness of sins. The Latter Day Saints do not believe in any kind of literal presence. They view the bread and water as symbolic of the body and blood of Christ. Currently The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints uses water instead of wine. Early in their history the Sacrament wine was often purchased from enemies of the church. To remove any opportunity for poisoned or unfit wine for use in the Sacrament, it is believed a revelation from the Lord was given that stated \\"it mattereth not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink when ye partake of the sacrament, if it so be that ye do it with an eye single to my glory—remembering unto the Father my body which was laid down for you, and my blood which was shed for the remission of your sins.\\" After this time water was permitted in place of wine, but the church continued to use wine for the sacrament until the early 20th century. As the church's prohibition on alcohol became solidified in the early 20th century, water became the liquid of choice for the Sacrament, although in situations where clean water and/or fresh bread is unavailable the closest equivalent may be used. = Seventh-day Adventists = The Seventh-day Adventists believe that the Lord's Supper is \\"a participation in the emblems of the body and blood of Jesus as an expression of faith in Him, our Lord and Saviour\\".

Set in 1820s during the early Risorgimento, when Italy was under Austrian control, it concerns the love affair of a young Roman princess and a revolutionary carbonaro. Synopsis Vanina Vanini, the nineteen-year-old daughter of a Roman aristocrat, Don Asdrubale Vanini, is sought after by all the young princes of Rome, but refuses them all, for of \\"the same [reason] that led Sulla to abdicate: her contempt for the Romans.\\"p. 167 When she notices that her usually carefree father is taking pains to lock up one room in his palace, and that a window in that room that is normally closed is open, she begins to investigate. Vanina finds another window that lets out on the same terrace, and looks through into the mysterious room. There, she sees a wounded woman lying in bed, as well as bloodstained woman's clothing that seems to have been pierced many times with a knife. She observes her father come up to the room and speak to the woman, though she cannot hear what the two are saying. Vanina is fascinated by the mysterious woman, and when, one evening, the woman sees Vanina spying, Vanina falls to her knees and tells the woman that she loves her and is devoted to her. The woman, who gives her name as Clementina, asks Vanina to visit her every day, but to keep the visits a secret from her father. Vanina wonders why the woman is hurt and must stay hidden; perhaps she has rejected a powerful man, or killed her lover. Clementina does not want the assistance of a surgeon, because surgeons are required to report wounds that they treat to the police, but Vanina offers to bring her a surgeon loyal to the family. The woman then reveals that she is in fact a man, Pietro Missirilli, a carbonaro and the nineteen-year-old son of a surgeon from Sant'Angelo in Vado. Missirilli's group had been ambushed and he taken in chains to Rome, but after thirteen months, he was helped to escape in disguise as a woman. However, as he left the prison, in a moment of folly he struck and killed a guard who cursed the carbonari, and was pursued through Rome and wounded. Finding himself in the garden of Countess Vitelleschi, Don Asdrubale's mistress, he was spirited away in the latter's carriage. Don Asdrubale has thus saved his life, but he is dying of his wound. That night, a surgeon arrives alone: Vanina's pride has been wounded by Missirilli's confession, and she does not want to see him. She is conflicted, struggling between love and pride, but eventually returns and confesses her love; soon after there is \\"nothing left that she could withhold from him.\\"p. 173 Four months later, Missirilli is recovered, and Vanina thinks that he will be happy to remain with her, but he wants to take revenge and liberate Italy. Several times he plans to leave, but she persuades him to stay; she offers to marry him, but he refuses her in the interest of Italian liberation, and his nobility makes her love him more. Missirilli goes to Forlì in Romagna, where he is made the leader of a band of carbonari. Vanina joins him there, giving a great deal of money and arms to his band; he is entirely occupied by his plans and his patriotism. She utterly fails to get him to show her love, but is too proud to leave him, so, via a former serving-maid, she denounces every member of Missirilli's band of carbonari, save Missirilli himself, to the authorities, hoping that this will end his plans and reunite him with her. Instead, Missirilli turns himself in — he does not want his compatriots to think, because he was the only one not captured, that he was the traitor. He asks Vanina to avenge him against whoever betrayed them, \\"even if it should be my own father.\\"p. 183 Vanina tries to win Missirilli's freedom: she gets her suitor Livio Savelli, nephew to the governor of Rome, to bring her information and to gain places in the governor's household and at Castel Sant'Angelo for two of her own servants, saying that these are tests of Savelli's worthiness. The other carbonari's sentences are commuted by the Pope to a few years in prison, but Missirilli is condemned to death. Vanina enters the house of Monsignor Catanzara, the governor of Rome, disguised as a man, and threatens him with a pistol, having unloaded his own pistol before he came home. She maneuvers the situation into a joke, a visit paid by a lady to her future uncle. She succeeds in getting him to try to commute the sentence; besides her persuasion, he is also motivated by the thought that he is still young and may see a day when the execution will be a stain on his character. Msgr. Catanzara obtains the pardon from the Pope. When Missirilli and the other carbonari are transferred to a new prison, Vanina arranges to meet him in a chapel at midnight, where he will be chained and in sight of a jailer, but where their conversation will not be overheard. Vanina hopes that he still loves her enough to pardon her treachery. Missirilli expresses regret for their affair, thinking that his misfortunes are punishment for having a passion other than Italian liberation. He wishes to remain friends, advises Vanina to marry Savelli, and promises that the money she contributed to the cause will be repaid when Italy is free. Vanina gives him the jewels she is wearing and files, so that he can use them to break his chains, but he asks her to forget him, for he is committed to dying for his country. Vanina angrily tells him everything she has done to save his life; then she says that she has done much more out of love for him, and reveals her betrayal. Missirilli, outraged, tries to kill her with his chains, but the jailer rushes in and restrains him. He throws back at her the jewels she has just given him. Shortly after, she returns to Rome and marries Livio Savelli. Adaptations Roberto Rossellini (1906–1977) adapted this story to a film of the same title in 1961 starring Sandra Milo (Vanina) and Laurent Terzieff (Pietro). In 1963, East German television broadcast a film based on the novel, starring Annekathrin Bürger in the title role, Peter Sturm as Asdrubale and Alfred Struwe as Savelli.Vanina Vanini (1963) on the IMDb.

He wrote from a liberal perspective, dissenting from many points of view taken as orthodox in the field. He was employed at the London School of Economics (LSE) from 1953 to 1990, becoming Professor of Politics. Kedourie was famous for his rejection of what he called the \\"Chatham House version\\" of history, which viewed the story of the modern Middle East as one of continuous victimisation at the hands of the West, and instead castigated left-wing Western intellectuals for what he regarded as a naively romantic view of Islam.  Early life  Kedourie was born in Baghdad; his background was Iraqi Jewish and he grew up in the Jewish quarter, attending the Alliance Française primary school and then the Shammash High School. He took an undergraduate degree at the LSE. Scholarship and controversyDoctoral thesis= Kedourie's doctoral thesis (afterwards published as England and the Middle East) was critical of Britain's interwar role in Iraq. It was refused a University of Oxford DPhil, but was published in 1956. It castigated British policy makers for their encouragement of Arab nationalism and contained a very negative view of T. E. Lawrence. Kedourie attacked British policy-makers for first creating in 1921 the Kingdom of Iraq out of the former Ottoman vilayets (provinces) of Mosul, Baghdad, and Basra and then imposing \\"a militantly Arab nationalist regime upon a diverse society\\". Kedourie refused to make the changes requested by one of the examiners, Sir Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb, and did not get the degree.Kedourie gives his own account of this affair in an introduction to the 1987 edition of England and the Middle East. Given the prestige of a DPhil at Oxford, Kedourie, in the words of the American historian Martin Kramer, displayed \\"much courage\\" in refusing to change his thesis. Kedourie's personal history helps to explain his viewpoint. Starting with the very first Iraqi ruler, King Faisal I and continuing on to the present, Iraqiness was and still is defined as being Islamic Arab; and, as an Iraqi Jew, Kedourie simply did not fit into the society that was being created in Iraq in the 1920s, 1930s and the 1940s. Iraq once had a large and flourishing Jewish community that predates the Arab invasion of the seventh century, but whose existence ended in the 20th century as a result of the rise of an Arabo-Islamic centered nationalist movements; most Iraqi Jews fled to Israel to escape persecution in Iraq. For Kedourie, the idea that someone like Lawrence was a romantic hero was absurd as Kedourie saw him instead as an irresponsible adventurer who by encouraging Arab nationalism had created a new state, Iraq that people like him did not belong in. In his view, it was no accident that, within less than a year after the granting of independence in October 1932, one of the first acts of the Iraqi state was the \\"Assyrian Affair\\" of August 1933, when the state sponsored the slaughter of the Assyrian minority, establishing from the start its intolerant and violent character. Far from an \\"awakening\\", Kedourie saw the rise of nationalism in the Middle East as a retrogression to the region's worst autocratic tendencies. As someone from the Middle East, Kedourie accused many Western Orientalists of having an idealised view of the Arab world, arguing that Western civilisation was not as rotten as the Orientalists would have it, nor was the Middle East the virtuous and innocent victim of Western imperialism that historians like Arnold Toynbee sought to present. =Subsequent career= Michael Oakeshott brought Kedourie back to the LSE in 1953. In 1964, Kedourie was founder and editor of the academic journal, Middle Eastern Studies. His 1960 book Nationalism provoked replies, in Thought and Change (1964) and Nations and Nationalism (1983), by his LSE colleague Ernest Gellner, who contested Kedourie's theories on the potential eliminability of nationalist thought. Kedourie was critical of Marxist interpretations of history and nationalism. Kedourie claimed that nationalism had turned the Middle East into \\"a wilderness of tigers\\". Kedourie also documented and criticised what he saw as the British Empire's debilitation by excessive self- criticism. In 1970, he attacked another British celebrity, Arnold J. Toynbee, in the essay The Chatham House Version, and held him partly responsible for the British abdication of responsibility for the state of the Middle East. Kedourie attacked Toynbee for his criticism of the British Empire, arguing that contra Toynbee that the British Empire had been a positive institution whose decline had brought disaster to its former colonies, most notably in the Middle East. Kedourie argued that multi-national empires like the British Empire, the Ottoman Empire and the Austrian Empire had allowed different peoples to live together in peace, and the break-up of empires had led to wars as nationalists fought each other for dominance. For Kedourie, Toynbee's work had denied the \\"civilizing role\\" played by the British Empire and white-washed the brutal tendencies of Third World nationalists whom Kedourie argued were far worse than the colonial powers they had replaced, which is why Kedourie attacked the \\"Chatham House version of history\\" with such vehemence. Kedourie had no use for nationalism, which saw as dividing people up, and believed that importing Western ideas of nationalism into the Middle East had been a disaster, as it turned people who once lived together in harmony into enemies as various peoples started to see themselves as part of this or that nation.Karsh 1999, p. 709. The Israeli historian Major Efraim Karsh criticised Kedourie for his thesis that the era of the Ottoman Empire was one of peaceful co-existence of peoples who did not have national identities, citing the Wahhabi raids; the wars of independence in Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria; the anti-Christian pogroms and massacres in the Levant in 1859–60; and the Hamidian massacres of Armenians, to demonstrate the limits of Kedourie's \\"peaceful co-existence\\" thesis. In his 1976 book, In the Anglo-Arab Labyrinth: The McMahon-Husayn Correspondence and Its Interpretations, 1914–1939, Kedourie exposed the myth of \\"the Great Betrayal\\" that British high commissioner in Egypt, Sir Henry McMahon had promised in 1914–15 the Sharif of Mecca Hussein bin Ali an empire in the Middle East and that the British betrayed the Sharif by signing the Sykes–Picot Agreement with the French in 1916, followed by the Balfour Declaration in 1917. Kedourie argued that British decision-makers in the interwar period, motivated in equal measure by a lack of cultural confidence and a desire to renege on their written promises to the French and Zionists had accepted the Arab nationalist claim that the Sharif Hussein had been promised an empire in the Near East, instead arguing that McMahon had made no such promise and the British claim of \\"defaulting\\" on their commitments to the Hashemites were entirely a myth created by British themselves. In a 1977 column published in the Times Literary Supplement, reviewing the book A Savage of War of Peace by Alistair Horne, Kedourie vigorously attacked Horne as an apologist for terrorism, accusing him of engaging the \\"cosy pieties\\" of bien-pensants as Kedourie condemned those Western intellectuals who excused terrorism when committed by Third World revolutionaries. Kedourie attacked Horne for claiming that it was the French who were responsible for the fact that most of the Algerian Muslims lived in conditions of dire poverty, though he acknowledged that Horne was correct that the racial barriers between the pied-noir and Muslim communities were a source of tension. Kedourie challenged Horne's account that racism on the part of the French had caused the war, instead arguing that the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) were a ruthless and very small group of radical intellectuals organised along Leninist lines who took advantage of French liberal democracy to wage a very brutal terrorist campaign that targeted both the French and any Muslim who was not with them. Kedourie argued that the fact Algeria had been a one-party dictatorship under the FLN since independence in 1962 was the \\"natural\\" result of the totalitarian mindset of the FLN. Kedourie stated that by 1958 the French were clearly winning the war and by 1959 had broken the back of the FLN.Brett 1994, pp. 226–7. Kedourie argued that Charles de Gaulle was the \\"master of the situation\\" by 1960 and could have ensured that the Algerian Muslims would have equal rights with the pied-noirs, but instead blinded by other ideas of French greatness chose to grant Algeria independence.\\".Brett 1994, p. 227. Kedourie charged that de Gaulle had cynically sacrificed the colons and the harkis as Kedourie charged that de Gaulle had chosen to disregard his constitutional oath as president to protect all the French to ensure that \\"the French withdrew and handed over power to the only organized body of armed men who were on the scene – a civilized government thus acting for all the world like the votary of some Mao or Ho, in the barbarous belief that legitimacy comes from the power of the gun\\". Kedourie's review sparked much debate at the time, and marked the beginning of a historical debate about the legitimacy of terrorism to achieve political goals that continues to the present day. For Kedourie, the FLN's use of terrorism negated whatever claim to moral legitimacy they claimed to have had. In 1992, in \\"The Wretched of Algeria\\", a review of the book Historie de l'Algérie by the French historian Charles-Robert Ageron, Kedourie condemned Ageron for being sympathetic to the FLN.Brett 1994, p.231. He again denounced de Gaulle for granting Algeria independence, writing that the Algerians \\"were cruelly abandoned to the mercies of the FLN, a handful of purs et durs, spurred on by nationalism, that curse of the modern world to seize power and rule for their own benefit. Their Arabizing policies, however, had opened up the country to the influence of fundamentalist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood in the Middle East, so that Islam came to provide the growing opposition with not only a political idiom, but also a revolutionary cause stigmatized by the same conspiratorial violence once shown by the FLN. Caught between the monsters of the FLN and those of the FIS or Islamic Salvation Front, the Algerian people are sure to pay the price\\". Personal life Kedourie was married to fellow scholar of the history of the Middle East, Sylvia Kedourie.

Svchost is essential in the implementation of so-called shared service processes, where a number of services can share a process in order to reduce resource consumption. Grouping multiple services into a single process conserves computing resources, and this consideration was of particular concern to NT designers because creating Windows processes takes more time and consumes more memory than in other operating systems, e.g. in the Unix family. However, if one of the services causes an unhandled exception, the entire process may crash. In addition, identifying component services can be more difficult for end users. Problems with various hosted services, particularly with Windows Update, get reported by users (and headlined by the press) as involving svchost. The svchost process was introduced in Windows 2000, although the underlying support for shared service processes has existed since Windows NT 3.1. Implementation Its executable image, or (for 32-bit services running on 64-bit systems) runs in multiple instances, each hosting one or more services. Services running in SvcHost are implemented as dynamically-linked libraries (DLLs). Each service's registry key must have a value named under the subkey, pointing to the respective service's DLL file. Their definition is of the form . Services sharing the same SvcHost process specify the same parameter, having a single entry in the SCM's database. The first time that a SvcHost process is launched with a specific parameter, it looks for a value of the same name under the key, which it interprets as a list of service names. Then it notifies the SCM of all the services that it hosts. SCM doesn't launch a second SvcHost process for any of those received services: instead, it simply sends a \\"start\\" command to the respective SvcHost process containing the name of the service that should be launched within its context, and whose respective DLL SvcHost loads. According to a 2003 MS presentation, the minimum working set of a shared service is approximately 150 KB instead of 800 KB for a standalone process.David B. Probert, Windows Service Processes = Changes to Service Host grouping in Windows 10 = Starting with Windows 10 version 1703, Microsoft changed the way services are grouped into host processesChanges to Service Host grouping in Windows 10. On client computer systems with more than 3.5 GB of memory, services are no longer grouped into shared host processes. Instead, each service is running in its own process. This results in a better isolation of services, making the computer system more resilient to service failures and vulnerabilities and easier to debug. However, it adds some memory overhead. = Service tags = Starting with Windows Vista, the internal identification of services inside shared processes (svchost included) is achieved by so-called service tags. The service tag for each thread is stored in the SubProcessTag of its thread environment block (TEB). The tag is propagated across all threads that a main service thread subsequently starts, except for threads created indirectly by Windows thread-pool APIs. The set of service tag management routines is currently an undocumented API, although it is used by some Windows utilities like netstat to display the TCP connections associated with each service. Some third party tools like ScTagQuery also make use of this API. = Svchost.exe (netsvcs) = Netsvcs is a sub process used by svchost.exe (netsvcs). If and when there is a memory leak the svchost.exe consumes and hogs the CPU. This issue occurs because a handle leak occurs in the Winmgmt service after installing Windows Management Framework 3.0 on the computer. The Winmgmt service is the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service within the svchost.exe process that is running under the LocalSystem account.  Identification and management of hosted services  In Windows XP and later editions, the command shows a list of the services being run by each listed process (i.e. by each running instance of svchost.exe), with each separate instance of the svchost process identified by a unique Process ID number (PID). In Windows Vista and Windows 7, the \\"Services\\" tab in Windows Task Manager includes a list of services, showing their groups and Process IDs (PIDs); right-clicking on an svchost instance in the Task Manager's \\"Processes\\" tab and selecting \\"Go to Service(s)\\" switches to that list of services and selects the service running under the corresponding svchost instance. In Windows 8, the Task Manager interface was streamlined so that each svchost entry can be expanded by a single click to a sub-list of services running inside it. The Sysinternals Process Explorer (available as a free download from Microsoft) provides additional information about services running under processes, when the user hovers the mouse over an svchost instance in Process Explorer. None of the above methods allows the user to identify which of the multiple services running inside an svchost instance accesses a particular resource, i.e. processor, disk, network or memory; the Windows Resource Monitor only accounts for (most of) those resources at process level. It does however show processor usage at service level, on the \\"CPU\\" tab. A service-aware list of TCP connections and UDP ports opened can be obtained using the command Whether this is useful is doubtful, it typically shows only the name of the service for the running web browser (e.g. it lists various items of information related to the internet connection and ports in use, but logs them all as simply \\"firefox.exe\\"). In order to troubleshoot other kinds of problems with a service running inside an svchost instance, the service(s) suspected to be causing the problem must (all) be reconfigured so that each runs inside its own svchost instance. For example, will reconfigure the service named \\"foo\\" to run in its own svchost instance. Changing the back to is done by an analogous command. The service must be restarted for such a configuration change to take effect. This debugging process is not foolproof however; in some cases, a heisenbug may occur, which causes the problem to go away when the service is running separately. A more complex method of troubleshooting is to create an isolated service group. In Windows 10, starting with release 1703, svchost was redesigned by Microsoft to host only one service per process, depending on available system memory. The default setting causes services to be hosted independently if the system has at least 3.5GB of RAM.

Born in Graiguenamanagh, County Kilkenny, O'Donnell first played competitive hurling whilst at school in St Kieran's College. He arrived on the inter- county scene at the age of twenty-one when he first linked up with the Kilkenny junior team. He joined the senior team for the 1947 championship, however, after failing to secure a place on the starting fifteen he later joined the Wexford team. O'Donnell went on to play a key part for Wexford during a golden age for the team, and won three All-Ireland medals, six Leinster medals and two National Hurling League medals. An All-Ireland runner- up on three occasions, O'Donnell also captained the team to All-Ireland victory in 1955 and 1960. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team for five years, O'Donnell won just one Railway Cup medal. At club level he won seven championship medals with St Aidan's, having earlier played for Éire Óg. After a fifteen-year inter-county career, O'Donnell retired from inter-county hurling following Wexford's defeat by Tipperary in the 1962 championship O'Donnell is widely regarded as the undisputed greatest full-back in the history of the game. During his playing days he was named Texaco Hurler of the Year in 1960. He has been repeatedly voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including at full-back on the Hurling Team of the Century in 1984 and the Hurling Team of the Millennium in 2000. Biography Nicholas O'Donnell was born in Graiguenamanagh, County Kilkenny in 1925. He was educated locally and was known as a shy and retiring gentleman. O'Donnell lived in Graiguenamanagh until 1950 when he moved to Enniscorthy, County Wexford to work with Roadstone Ltd. He remained in his adopted county until his death in 1988. Due to his noticeably slender frame, he received the nickname \\"skinny\\" early on in his career. Playing careerClub= O'Donnell began his club hurling career with Éire Óg in Kilkenny. In 1947 he lined out in his first championship decider. Tullaroan provided the opposition, however, a 3–10 to 0–13 victory gave O'Donnell a Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship medal. A move to Wexford saw O'Donnell join the St Aidan's club in Enniscorthy. In 1952 the club reached the county decider. Horsewood provided the opposition, however, a victory for St. Aidan's gave O'Donnell his first championship medal with his adopted club. It was the first of three-in-a-row for St. Aidan's, as subsequent victories over Geraldine O'Hanrahan's in 1953 and Horsewood in 1954 gave O'Donnell two more championship medals. Four-in-a-row proved beyond St. Aidan's, however, the club bounced back in 1956 with O'Donnell winning a fourth championship medal in Wexford. Once again St. Aidan's went on to dominate the club championship and secured four successive championship titles, bringing O'Donnell's overall medal tally to seven. =Inter-county= O'Donnell first played at inter-county level with the Kilkenny junior team in 1946. Unable to dislodge Pat \\"the Diamond\\" Hayden from the full-back position on the team, he won a set of Leinster and All-Ireland medals as a non-playing substitute. Success in this grade earned O'Donnell a call up to the Kilkenny senior team. Once again, Hayden stood in the way of O'Donnell being picked on the starting fifteen. In spite if this he was an unused substitute when Kilkenny captured the Leinster crown. O'Donnell was a substitute again when Kilkenny later defeated Cork by 0–14 to 2–7 in, what has been described as, the greatest All-Ireland final of all-time. In spite of being a named substitute, he received no All-Ireland medal. Kilkenny had a panel of twenty- two for the game but only received twenty-one All-Ireland medals. O'Donnell was deemed the last man, a decision which rankled with him for the rest of his life. He later said: \\"Kilkenny, my native county, still 'owes' me an All- Ireland senior hurling championship medal – the one I never got when I was a member of the panel of Kilkenny's championship of 1947. I was never bitter about it, but I always felt very disappointed about it. It was my first All- Ireland senior one.\\" O'Donnell soldiered with the Kilkenny team for another few years without any hope of breaking onto the starting fifteen. A move to Wexford saw him declare for their senior hurling team in 1951. He made his debut at full-back against Dublin that year, before later lining out in his first provincial decider. A 3–12 to 4–3 defeat of Laois gave O'Donnell his first Leinster medal. A subsequent defeat of Galway saw Wexford qualify for the All-Ireland final on 2 September 1951, their first appearance in the decider since 1918. Tipperary provided the opposition as they aimed to secure a hat-trick of championship titles for the first time in over half a century. Nicky Rackard, Wexford's goal-scoring machine, was nullified by Tipp goalkeeper Tony Reddin, while Séamus Bannon, Tim Ryan and Paddy Kenny scored key goals which powered Tipp to a 7–7 to 3–9 victory. Wexford faced back-to- back provincial decider defeats over the next two years, however, in 1954 the team regrouped. A huge 8–5 to 1–4 defeat of Dublin gave O'Donnell a second Leinster medal. Cork provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 5 September 1954 and, once again, it was an historic occasion as Cork's Christy Ring was provided with an opportunity of capturing a record- breaking eighth All-Ireland medal. A record attendance of 84,856 packed into Croke Park, and Wexford had the reigning champions and three-in-a-row hopefuls rattled. O'Donnell's side had a 1–3 to 0–5 lead at the interval, however, he was forced to leave the field with an injured collarbone after a clash with Ring. Wexford still had a four-point lead at the three-quarter stage, however, Johnny Clifford scored a vital goal to secure a 1–9 to 1–6 victory for Cork. In 1955 O'Donnell was honoured with the captaincy, as Wexford continued their provincial dominance. He collected a third Leinster medal that year following a 5–6 to 3–9 defeat of Kilkenny in a replay of the Leinster final. Galway, who got a bye into the All-Ireland final without picking up a hurley, provided the opposition on 4 September 1955. A Tim Flood goal nine minutes from the end clinched a 3–13 to 2–8 victory for Wexford and a first All-Ireland medal for O'Donnell, while he also had the honour of lifting the Liam MacCarthy Cup. It was Wexford's first All-Ireland triumph in forty-five years. Wexford continued their dominance in 1956. A 5–9 to 2–14 defeat of Tipperary gave O'Donnell a first National Hurling League medal. The subsequent championship campaign saw Wexford reach the provincial final once again. A narrow 4–8 to 3–10 defeat of Kilkenny gave O'Donnell his fourth Leinster medal. Galway fell heavily in the All-Ireland semi-final, allowing Wexford to advance to an All-Ireland final meeting with Cork on 23 September 1956. The game has gone down in history as one of the all-time classics as Christy Ring was bidding for a record ninth All-Ireland medal. The game turned on one important incident as the Wexford goalkeeper, Art Foley, made a miraculous save from a Ring shot and cleared the sliotar up the field to set up another attack. Nicky Rackard scored a crucial goal with two minutes to go giving Wexford a 2–14 to 2–8 victory. In spite of Cork's loss Wexford's O'Donnell and Rackard, in an unparalleled display of sportsmanship in any game, raised Christy Ring onto their shoulders and carried him off the field. Wexford had won the game and O'Donnell had collected his second All-Ireland medal but there was no doubt in their minds that the real hero was Ring. Two year later in 1958 O'Donnell added a second National League medal to his collection following a 5–7 to 4–8 defeat of Limerick. In 1960 O'Donnell was captain once again, and Wexford were back in the provincial decider. A narrow 3–10 to 2–11 defeat of Kilkenny gave O'Donnel his fifth Leinster medal. The All-Ireland decider on 4 September 1960 saw Tipperary provide the opposition. A pitch invasion at the end resulted in much confusion, however, goals by Mick Hassett and Oliver McGrath gave Wexford a merited 2–15 to 0–11 victory. It was O'Donnell's third All-Ireland medal and his second time lifting the Liam MacCarthy Cup. After surrendering their titles the following year, Wexford were back in 1962. Another narrow 3–9 to 2–10 defeat of Kilkenny gave O'Donnell a sixth Leinster medal. The All-Ireland final on 2 September 1962 was a repeat of 1960 with Tipperary, the reigning champions, lining out in opposition. Wexford, however, were not the force of old and the side got off to possibly the worst start ever by a team in a championship decider. After just ninety seconds the Leinster champions were down by two goals, courtesy of Tom Moloughney and Seán McLoughlin. The game, however, turned out to be much closer than people expected. Tipp eventually secured the win on a score line of 3–10 to 2–11. O'Donnell retired from inter- county hurling following this defeat. =Inter-provincial= In 1956, having previously been told that there was no place for him on the team, O'Donnell took over the full-back position on the Leinster inter-provincial team. That year he captained his province to victory, and was accompanied on the team by nine of his fellow Wexford players. He continued to play with Leinster until 1961, however, Munster were the dominant force in the Railway Cup at the rime. Recognition Over twenty years after his retirement from playing, O'Donnell received the ultimate honour during the GAA's centenary year in 1984 when he was chosen at full-back on the Hurling Team of the Century. His reputation as the undisputed greatest full-back of all-time was further cemented in 2000 when he was named in the same position on the Hurling Team of the Millennium.

The specific name acaulis (New Latin for \\"without a stem,\\" from Latin caulis \\"stem\\" or \\"stalk\\") and common names are descriptive of the manner in which its flower head rests directly upon a basal leaf rosette. The spiny, pinnatilobate leaves grow in a basal rosette approximately 20 cm in diameter. The flowers are produced in a large (up to 10 cm) flowerhead of silvery-white ray florets around a central disc. The disc florets are tubular and yellow-brown in colour. To protect the pollen, the head closes in wet weather, a phenomenon folklore holds to presage forthcoming rain. The flowering time is between August and September. It prefers chalky soils and dry pastures in environments from valleys up to an altitude of 2,800 m. ;Subspecies There are two subspecies: * Carlina acaulis subsp. acaulis – inflorescences sessile * Carlina acaulis subsp. simplex – inflorescences with a short stem  Uses  The rhizome contains a number of essential oils, in particular the antibacterial carlina oxide. The root was formerly employed in herbal medicine as a diuretic and cold remedy. While young, the flowerhead bud can be cooked and eaten in a similar manner to the Globe artichoke, which earned it the nickname of hunter's bread. It is sometimes cultivated as a rockery plant, or dried and hung as a house decoration. In Basque culture it was traditionally used as symbol of good fortune, fixed into the frontal door of the house and was given by the goddess Mari.

The so-called \\"Chilean War\\" resulted in several deaths and the expulsion of Chilean miners from their claims. Accounts vary widely about the details, with some including mention of Joaquin Murrieta's involvement on the side of the Chileans.

Miller (born April 6, 1970) is an American former professional basketball player. He played college basketball at the University of Arkansas and was drafted by the Phoenix Suns in 1992. After his initial stint in the NBA from 1992 to 1998, where he became the heaviest player in league history, Miller played overseas and for semi-professional American teams. He returned to the NBA for the 2003–04 season, but transitioned back to minor-league and semi-professional play until 2010. Career After graduating from the University of Arkansas, Miller, who is known as \\"The Big O\\" because of his large size (6-foot-9 and well over 300 pounds throughout his pro career), was selected by the Phoenix Suns with the 22nd overall pick of the 1992 NBA draft. He went on to play for various NBA teams over his eight-year career, including the Suns (1992–94, 1999–2000), Detroit Pistons (1994–95), Toronto Raptors (1995–96 and 1997–98), Dallas Mavericks (1996–97) and Sacramento Kings (1998–99). He was signed by the Indiana Pacers during the 2002 pre-season but was waived before the regular season began. Miller was known as a talented center with good passing skills, averaging 12.9 points, 7.4 rebounds, 2.9 assists, 1.9 blocks and 1.4 steals per game at his peak (1995–96). However, he was also notorious for his weight problems. In the beginning of his career, he was officially listed at 270 pounds, but in the later years of his NBA career he ballooned to 380 pounds, seriously reducing his mobility and stamina. Following his initial stint in the NBA, Miller moved overseas, joining Iraklio BC in Greece for the 1998–99 season, before signing with the Kings in February 1999 to play in 4 games. He spent the next season back with the Suns, playing in 51 games. After the season, Miller became a bit of a basketball vagabond, joining the Harlem Globetrotters for the first of two stints with the team, then Pruszkow in Poland and back to the Globetrotters. In December 2001, after another brief term with the Globetrotters, Miller was released for showing \\"no appreciation for what it takes mentally and physically to be a Harlem Globetrotter\\". In January 2002 he signed with Roseto of Italy but did not play there, and then joined the Continental Basketball Association with the Gary Steelheads before moving to the competing American Basketball Association's Southern California Surf and the USBL's Dodge City Legend. He returned to the Steelheads in October 2002, and was traded to the Dakota Wizards in February 2003. In the 2003–04 season, Miller made a comeback with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Despite being listed at 315 lb, he was still able to play an average of 10 minutes a game off the bench in his last NBA season. After a stint in Puerto Rico, Miller returned to the Wizards in October 2004 and next played with the Texas Tycoons in the ABA until February 2005. He then played in 2005 for the Arkansas RimRockers in the ABA. After his stint in the ABA, Miller was signed to the Lawton-Fort Sill Cavalry of the Premier Basketball League. He was signed March 15, 2010 and released in December. Conviction In April 2011, he was accused of pistol-whipping a man during an altercation at a barbecue cookout in Arnold, Maryland. He was arrested and charged with first- and second-degree assault, reckless endangerment, possessing a handgun, using a handgun in a violent crime, possessing a handgun in a vehicle and disorderly conduct, among other charges. On November 1, 2011, Miller pleaded guilty in Anne Arundel County to first-degree assault and possessing a handgun. He was sentenced on February 3, 2012 to a year in the Anne Arundel County jail (a five-year sentence with four years suspended), followed by five years of probation. Later life The father of two sons and a daughter, Miller said in May 2013 that he had moved to the Mesa, Arizona area the previous August and had been selling cars there for four months, working for former basketball player Alvin Heggs. Miller was inducted into the University of Arkansas Sports Hall of Honor in September 2016 and was selected as an SEC Basketball Legend in January 2017. In September 2020, Miller was reported to be retired and living in Phoenix with a claimed weight of 278 lbs, spending his time participating in basketball camps and playing with his grandchildren.

History The station was built for the Stockport, Disley and Whaley Bridge Railway by the London and North Western Railway and opened on 9 June 1857. From 1923 until 1948, it was owned by the London Midland and Scottish Railway and, following nationalisation, it was operated by the London Midland Region of British Railways. At one time there was another station in the village, Hazel Grove (Midland) station, on the Midland Railway's line from New Mills South Junction to Manchester Central via Cheadle Heath; this opened in 1902, but it was less conveniently situated and closed in 1917. The line was extremely expensive to build with extensive earthworks. The navvies were accommodated in specially-built houses near the Rising Sun pub, which still exist, and are known as the \\"Navvy Mansions\\". The line from Edgeley Junction, just south of Stockport, to Hazel Grove was electrified in 1981 on the 25 kV AC overhead system. This allowed electric trains on the route from , via Sale, to serve the station until that line was closed for conversion to Manchester Metrolink operation in late 1991; electric services to and from Piccadilly continued thereafter. The signal box on the Buxton- bound platform remains in use. This controls the junction between the Buxton line and the chord linking it to the route through Disley Tunnel towards Sheffield at the country end of the station; it also controls a pair of carriage sidings at the Stockport end used for stabling trains that terminate here. The station in the 1900s Facilities The station is staffed all week, with its ticket office on platform 1 open 06:05-19:00 weekdays (until 20:00 on Fridays only), 07:00-20:00 Saturdays and 09:00-16:30 Sundays. There are waiting rooms on both platforms, toilets in the main building and a small coffee shop on platform 2. Train running details are provided via automated announcements, timetable posters and digital information screens. Step-free access is available to both platforms via the lifts built into the footbridge linking the platforms.Hazel Grove station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 23 February 2017 Services Today Hazel Grove is served by three trains per hour to/from Manchester Piccadilly – the two trains per hour to/from Manchester Piccadilly to Buxton and the hourly Manchester Piccadilly to Hazel Grove stopping service.

She was launched 13 March 1944 by Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Kearny, New Jersey; sponsored by Miss M. Sperry; commissioned 17 May 1944, Commander H. H. McIlhenny in command; and reported to the Pacific Fleet. =United States Navy=World War II After training in the Hawaiian Islands, Charles S. Sperry arrived at Ulithi 28 December 1944 to join the fast carrier force, TP 38. For the remainder of the war, she sailed in the screen of the third group of this mighty force, variously designated TF 38 and TF 58. She sortied with her group for the first time on 30 December, bound for the areas from which the carriers launched strikes against Japanese bases on Formosa and Luzon in preparation for the assault on Lingayen Gulf beaches. Continuing to neutralize Japanese airfields the force moved on to strike at targets in Indochina, on the South China coast, and on Okinawa before returning to Ulithi 26 January 1945. Sperry sailed with TF 58 once more on 10 February 1945, as the force began its familiar work in preparation for the invasion of Iwo Jima. An audacious raid against Tokyo itself was first on the schedule, the first carrier strikes on the heart of Japan since the Doolittle Raid. On 16 and 17 February, planes from the carriers guarded by Sperry roared over Tokyo, in attacks which inflicted substantial material damage, and great moral damage, to the Japanese war effort. Sperry forces offered direct support during the assault landings at Iwo Jima. Twice, on 19 February and on 20–21 February, the carrier force came under air attack from the enemy, but antiaircraft fire from Sperry and the other screening ships, combined with evasive maneuvering and a protective smoke screen, prevented damage to the great concentration of ships. A final round of air strikes was hurled at Tokyo and Okinawa before TF 58 returned to Ulithi 5 March. Once more designated TF 38, the force cleared Ulithi 14 March 1945 for the Okinawa operation, which would keep Sperry and many other ships at sea almost continuously until 1 June. First came air strikes against Kyushu, for which the Japanese retaliated with heavy air attacks against the carrier force on 19 and 20 March. While was badly damaged in these attacks, Sperry and other escorts furnished effective antiaircraft fire which pre vented further harm to the force, and she shared in splashing several Japanese planes. USS Charles S. Sperry alongside USS Bunker Hill, 11 May 1945. Sperry turned south with her force for strikes against Okinawa. The destroyer joined in a bombardment of the Japanese airstrip on tiny but critically located Minami Daito Shima 27 March. Close air support was provided by TF 38 as the invasion began on 1 April 1945, and Sperry served as plane guard and radar picket for her force. On 7 April, planes from the carriers she screened joined in sending , her accompanying cruiser, and four of eight guardian destroyers to the bottom. Sperry herself fired often, aiding in splashing planes of the kamikaze strikes hurled at her force on 11, 14, 16, and 29 April, and 11 May. When and fell victim to kamikazes, Sperry stood by them, aiding in damage control, and rescuing men from the water. The destroyer remained in San Pedro Bay, Philippines, from 1 June to 1 July, and then sailed to support the carriers as they launched the final air strikes at the Japanese home islands. Cover for the first occupation landings and the evacuation of Allied prisoners of war from Japanese prison camps was flown by the carriers, and on 31 August, the great force arrived off Tokyo Bay for the surrender ceremonies held on 2 September. =Post-World War II= Sperry remained in the Far East, taking part in exercises, on patrol, and carrying mail, until 30 December 1945, when she departed Sasebo for the east coast, arriving at Baltimore 19 February 1946. For the next year, she remained at Boston with a reduced crew, and in March 1947, reported at New Orleans for duty as a training ship for members of the Naval Reserve until July 1950. After overhaul at Norfolk, she sailed for the Far East, arriving off embattled Korea 14 October 1950. Korean War The destroyer operated almost continuously off Korea until June 1951. For her first 2 weeks in action, she fired on shore installations at Songjin, screened shipping, and patrolled areas swept of mines to guard against their remaining. During November and December 1950 she continued her fire support and bombardments, covered the redeployments from Kojo, Wonsan, and Hung-nam, and screened salvage operations. On 23 December, while firing at Songjin, she was hit by three shells returned by an enemy shore battery, but suffered no casualties, and only minor damage, which was repaired at Sasebo early in January 1951. She returned to the Korean firing line to cover salvage operations north of the 38th parallel and conduct bombardments along the coast. As operations leading to the classic blockade of Wonsan began, Charles S. Sperry entered the dangerous harbor 17 January 1951 to provide interdiction fire, and to cover the landings which secured the harbor islands. She cleared the Wonsan area 5 March for Songjin, where she joined in setting the siege, and until 6 June was almost constantly patrolling and firing on shore installations at Songjin. She then sailed for home, arriving at Norfolk 2 July. =Service, 1951-1974= Taking up the operating schedule of the Destroyer Force, Atlantic, Charles S. Sperry sailed from Norfolk through 1960. In 1953, 1955, 1956, 1958, and 1959 she cruised in the Mediterranean with the 6th Fleet. During her 1956 deployment, which coincided with the Suez Crisis, she escorted the transports which evacuated American nationals from Egypt. Midshipmen cruises and North Atlantic Treaty Organization exercises took her to northern European ports on several occasions, some of them in coordination with her Mediterranean deployments. Late in 1959, Sperry began an extensive overhaul for rehabilitation and modernization, including the addition of a sophisticated remotely operated torpedo equipped anti-submarine helicopter known as Drone Anti Submarine Helicopter (DASH). After completion of this major refitting she operated on the east coast and was located in Newport RI in the late 1960s. In the summer of 1968 she cruised the Caribbean and was in San Juan, Puerto Rico in late June as the U S Navy's representative for the celebration of feast of St. John (San Juan), a national holiday. : [1960-1974] =Chilean Navy= On 8 January 1974, Charles S. Sperry was transferred to Chile by sale. She was renamed Ministro Zenteno (D-16). After many years of active service in the Chilean Navy, the old destroyer was finally scrapped in 1990. Awards Charles S. Sperry received four battle stars for her service in World War II, and four battle stars for the Korean War.

It is on the Hope Valley Line between Manchester Piccadilly and Sheffield, east of the former. The town is also served by New Mills Newtown station, which is on the Buxton to Stockport and Manchester line. History The sign and canopy have changed since this 1970 photo In the mid-19th century, the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway ran as far as Rowsley and was extended by the Midland Railway to Buxton, in its aim to run as far as Manchester. The Manchester, Sheffield & Lincolnshire Railway also wished to extend southwards from its main line through Woodhead Tunnel to Sheffield and had built a branch to Hyde. Meanwhile, the London and North Western Railway had constructed their own line to Buxton from Whaley Bridge, with a station at Newtown, which effectively blocked the other two. An agreement was reached whereby the MS&LR; would build their proposed \\"Marple, New Mills and Hayfield Junction Railway\\", while the Midland Railway would extend its line to New Mills from Millers Dale via Chinley. Passenger services began to Hayfield in 1868 and the line came under joint control as the Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies' Committee in 1870, while the Midland's line opened in 1867. Although the Hayfield branch is now closed, as is the tunnel (though a stub of the old branch line through the tunnel was used for some years afterwards as a turnback siding for trains terminating here), users can still travel most of its route on foot, bicycle or horse, along what is now known as the Sett Valley Trail. Station New Mills Central station, May 1980 The station lies at the junction of what was the Hayfield branch and the Midland line; the two appearing through tunnels on a ledge blasted out of the cliff face, some forty feet above the River Goyt. The buildings on the down side still exist, as does the stationmaster's house built in 1864. The London line from Millers Dale closed in 1967 and the Hayfield branch closed in January 1970, but the station still supports the Hope Valley Line local service from Sheffield to Manchester. Stopping trains from Sheffield formerly terminated here and those passengers wishing to travel onwards to Manchester had to change trains (most express services from Sheffield to Manchester ran through without stopping). This practice ceased, however, when through trains were diverted via Hazel Grove and Stockport in 1986. The station does, however, remain a terminus for many services from the Manchester direction — these can now return directly from the eastbound platform following signalling alterations in 2007 that also saw the remaining semaphore signals at the station replaced by colour lights. A siding remains at the Marple end of the station to enable empty DMUs to be stabled clear of the main line. The booking office is on platform 1. Train running details are offered via automated announcements, digital display screens and timetable posters. No level access is available: access to the booking office and platform 1 is via a steep lane from the main road, while platform 2 is accessed by means of a path and flight of steps. Services There is now a half-hourly service to Manchester Piccadilly northbound on weekdays and an hourly stopping service to Sheffield. An hourly service operates in both directions on a Sunday.

Dutzow, the first permanent German settlement in Missouri, was founded in 1832 by Baron von Bock. The area is named after the Rhineland region in central Europe, a wine-growing area around the Rhine river, by German-Americans who noticed similarities in the two regions' soil and topography. The soils of the Missouri River Valley and surrounding areas are mainly rocky residual soils left after the carbonate (mainly limestone) bedrock weathered away to impurities of clayey soil and chert fragments. Farther to the north, glacial deposits and wind-deposited loess, a silty soil also associated with the glaciers, are intermingled with the residual soils. While the soil could support other crops, the steep slopes of these areas were better used for viticulture. German settlers established the first wineries in the mid-19th century. Italian immigrants later established their own vineyards, especially near Rolla in Phelps County. By 1920, Missouri was the second-largest wine- producing state in the nation. Then came Prohibition, which ruined the industry. In the 1960s, local winemakers began to rebuild, part of a movement in states across the country. In 1980, An area around Augusta, Missouri, was designated by the federal government as the first American Viticultural Area (AVA), and one around Hermann, Missouri, was designated an AVA in 1983. Much of the region of the Missouri Rhineland from Augusta to Jefferson City along the Missouri River is part of the larger Ozark Mountain AVA. Winning national tasting awards, the state's wine industry contributes to both the agricultural and tourist economies. History A German attorney and author named Gottfried Duden purchased land on the north side of the Missouri River along Lake Creek that he first visited in 1824. He was investigating the possibilities of settlement in the area by his countrymen. In 1827 he returned to Germany, which he felt was overpopulated. There in 1829 he published Bericht über eine Reise nach den westlichen Staaten Nordamerikas (Journal of a trip to the western states of North America), extolling the attractions of Missouri. In 1832, members of the small so-called Berlin Society communally purchased land that became the village of Dutzow, founded by Baron von Bock of Mecklenberg, Germany in March 1834. Led by Friedrich Muench and Paul Follenius of the Giessen Emigration Society, German immigrants arrived in the area in 1834. Resident Friedrich Muench became known for his expertise in the cultivation of grapes and wine making. Muench was a prominent writer and lecturer and wrote a number of books. He frequently wrote under the name of \\"Far West\\". His book American Grape Culture was published in 1859. Also, in 1859, Friedrich Muench's brother George founded Mount Pleasant Winery based upon the principles and advice of expert viticulturist, Friedrich Muench. In 1836 the German Settlement Society began to look for a place to build a German community insulated from the increasing diversity of nationalities found in many American settlements. They chose to settle in Hermann, Missouri, and the first settlers arrived in 1837. An early leader of the settlers was George Bayer, who arrived in early 1838. The soil on the hillsides surrounding the settlement was not appropriate for many forms of agriculture, but was ideal for grapes. Hermann's trustees decided to sell tracts of land with the agreement that they be planted as vineyards. The Weinstrasse The area along Route 94 between Defiance and Marthasville has so many wineries that the highway has been nicknamed the Missouri Weinstrasse (wine route). It runs parallel to much of the Katy Trail, built in former railway right-of-way. This area has the highest concentration of wineries in the state. Many of these sit high up on south-facing bluffs above the river. For a short while during the American Civil War, Missouri ranked as the number one producer of wine in the nation. Prior to Prohibition, Missouri was the United States' second largest producer of wine. In 1920, Missouri had more than 100 wineries. Because of Prohibition all wineries were shut down, with one exception: Saint Stanislaus Seminary in Florissant was allowed to continue making sacramental wine.Brett Dufur, \\"History of Missouri Wine Industry\\", Missouri Wine Country, accessed October 19, 2009. Prohibition lasted until 1933 and ended the Missouri wine industry. Vineyards were either pulled up and used for other purposes or left untended. Winery facilities were converted to serve other purposes or left to decay. Some wineries began producing again after Prohibition ended, but significant production did not begin until the 1960s and 1970s. This was when small winemakers began building in many different areas of the United States. In 1965 Stone Hill Winery in Hermann, south of the Missouri River, was the first in the state to be re-established. The Augusta AVA in Augusta was designated the first American Viticultural Area (AVA) in the United States in 1980 and Hermann AVA in Hermann was designated an AVA three years later. As of 2009, 88 wineries were operating in Missouri.

Arguably his most memorable game may have been in 1996 during the Tehran derby between Persepolis FC and Esteghlal. Persepolis had not beaten Esteghlal for seven seasons, but Bezik was able to score the last minute winner in that match to claim a spot in many Persepolis fan's hearts. Success was short-lived though and after a couple of very poor seasons, he along with many other Persepolis players were let go from the team. Bezik was immediately signed by Foolad Sepahan. His move to Isfahan was just what his career needed. In the 2002–03 season of the IPL, Bezik became the league's top goalscorer with 13 goals, and led the team to the league championship. He was deservedly called up to the national team and was starting to make his way into the squad when he became injured. He has come back from his injury but has not been able to score consistently. When new Sepahan manager, Luka Bonačić was hired, he deemed that Bezik was not needed for the squad.

Biography Samuel Johnson was born a recaptive 'Creole' in Freetown, Sierra Leone, as the third of seven children of Henry Erugunjinmi Johnson & Sarah Johnson on June 24, 1846. His father, who gave himself the Yoruba name Erugunjinmi was born in 1810 in the town of Oyo-Ile, capital of the Oyo Empire.https://dacb.org/stories/nigeria/johnson-henry/ Henry was an omoba (prince) of the Oyo clan, he was a grandson of the 18th- century alaafin (king) Abiodun. He was later captured in the Atlantic Slave Trade but forunately was rerouted to Sierra Leone, like many Yorubas, such as Samuel Ajayi Crowther (his distant cousin) and others. He later met Samuel Johnson had 2 older brothers, Henry & Nathaniel, and a younger brother, Obadiah. Henry and Nathaniel both became missionaries and archdeacons like Samuel while Obadiah became the first indigenous Yoruba medical doctor.https://dacb.org/stories/nigeria/johnson-1samuel/ He completed his education at the Church Missionary Society (CMS) Training Institute and subsequently taught during what became known as the Yoruba civil war. Johnson and Charles Phillips, also of the CMS, arranged a ceasefire in 1886 and then a treaty that guaranteed the independence of the Ekiti towns. Ilorin refused to cease fighting however, and the war dragged on. In 1880, he became a deacon and in 1888 a priest. He was based in Oyo from 1881 onward and completed a work on Yoruba history in 1897. This event is said to have been caused by him fearing that his people were losing their history, and that they were beginning to know European history better. Ironically, this work was misplaced by his British publishers. After his death, his brother Dr. Obadiah Johnson re-compiled and rewrote the book, using the reverend's copious notes as a guide. In 1921, he released it as A History of the Yorubas from the Earliest Times to the Beginning of the British Protectorate. The book has since been likened to The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon.

Its a place of fundamental importance for Turkey's Alevi-Bektashiyyah tariqa populations. Certain Alevi organizations describe cemevis as places of worship, and ask for this to be officially recognized. However, the Directorate of Religious Affairs of Turkey doesn't recognise cemevis as Muslim places of worship, only Sunni and Ja'fari- Shi’ite mosques.Presidency of Religious Affairs of Turkey, press release (Turkish) A place of gathering for Bektash’īyyah tariqa Interior of the historical Şahkulu Sultan Dergahi Cemevi in Kadıköy, Istanbul. It is primarily considered a place of assembly (Cem; pronounced djam, from Arabic الجمع, al- jamʕ). Historically, the cems were usually held outdoors, using candles and torches to light up the place of gathering when it got dark. Often, people from nearby places would come to a cem to have a collective meal. The participants would often bring along food, which they would then distribute during the meal. Nowadays, some of these customs are still preserved. Men and women conduct cem activities and rites together. The structuring of cemevi as into their present characteristics and rites owes much to the Bektashi tradition within various historical currents of Turkey's Alevi culture. Urbanization of many Alevis also brought changes in the conception of cem. In larger towns in Turkey today, cemevi are multi functional buildings where a broad range of cultural activities take place. In Turkey, it is always problematic for a cemevi to get off the ground, due to strict state interference in religious matters, and cases of discrimination against the Alevis, which results in the founding of each cemevi acquiring political dimensions and necessitating case-by-case lobbyism. Vast Majority of Alevis consider themselves to be Muslims, a view shared by the Turkish state. There is some disagreement as to whether Alevism should be considered a religious tradition at all some Alevis may describe it as a subethnic solidarity and/or cultural tradition. For those who recognize it as religious, they consider it a form of Islam (often, a branch of Shia'ism), while a few claim it to represent an independent, non-Islamic religion (a radical position held by relatively few adherents). Relations with Turkey's Sunni majority are difficult, though some dialogue has occurred. Besides historical or theological grievances, the issues often center around outbreaks of anti-Alevi violence, complaints of systematic discrimination, and official non- recognition of Alevi identity. The latter has resulted in attempts to assimilate Alevis into a Sunni-dominated Islam, e.g. through the construction of state-funded mosques, or compulsory religious education which excludes or marginalizes Alevi practices and teachings. Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdağ indicated that a total of 329 cemevis have been established since their political party came to power on Nov. 3, 2002.

It lies at an elevation of 253 feet (77 m) and is located at . The community is in ZIP code 95252 and area code 209. Located on the north bank of the Calaveras River, Jenny Lind was a placer mining town as early as 1849. Most of the placer mining was done along the hillsides above the river; later the river was mined with dredgers. In 1864 the population was said to be 400, half of them Chinese. Being on the main road from Stockton, it was also an important freighting center for the area. The town is likely named after the Swedish singer Jenny Lind, although there are several tales about its naming. One story has it that it was really named for Dr. John Y. Lind. Another says that the braying of pack mules prompted the miners to use the singer's name in sarcastic humor. Most likely, it was named in the singer's honor, although she never came to California. The town today is registered as California Historical Landmark #266. A post office operated at Jenny Lind from 1857 to 1944 and again from 1947 to 1951.

A set of sprockets (called a \\"cassette\\") are mounted onto a splined shaft of the freehub to engage the chain. The ratcheting mechanism is a part of the hub, in contrast to a freewheel, an older technology, which contains both the sprockets and a ratcheting mechanism in a single unit separate from the hub. In many high-end and midrange bicycles, freehubs have replaced freewheel systems. A freewheel mechanism allows a rider to stop pedalling whilst the cycle is still in forward motion. On a cycle without a freewheel mechanism, the rider has to keep pedalling whenever the cycle is moving. Comparison to freewheels Freehub vs freewheel hub The freehub concept answers several drawbacks encountered with the freewheel design: * Freewheels are threaded onto an axle hub, using conventional right-hand threads. As the bicycle rider pedals, the freewheel is continuously kept tight, as chain torque is in the right-hand direction. This becomes a problem when the freewheel needs to be removed. Having undergone high torque from leg muscles, it is difficult to loosen and remove the freewheels. A freehub, on the other hand, has cogs that slide onto an axially- splined cylindrical outer shell. A lockring or the last cog(s) are threaded onto the freehub. It is fastened to the wheel hub itself with a hollow retaining screw (for example, using a hex key on some models) through which the axle is inserted during operation. * The chain gear sprockets wear faster than the ratcheting mechanism. Replacing individual sprockets on a freehub cassette is easy compared to that on some freewheels. * The ball bearings for the wheel's axle are in the hub, but a multi-speed freewheel requires a considerable distance between the drive-side bearings and the drive-side frame dropout. This distance acts as a leverage force on the axle. Since the freehub can have its bearings near the end of the cassette (and the dropout), axle bending and breaks are far less common. Not all manufactures/models use this design. Those designs often use an axle made from oversize aluminum to compensate for the additional bending moment on the axle. Beyond removal from the hub and of the cassette, there is limited, if any, access for cleaning and lubrication. The part can be fabricated relatively inexpensively and is not intended to be serviced or disassembled with hand tools. The latter is only possible by means of specialized or shop equipment. The outer cup covering the ratchet pawls and bearings is pressed into place at the factory, secured by interference fit, leveraging the same inner threads of the shell into which the cassette lockring normally screws. History The concept of a freehub was devised and manufactured by British company Bayliss-Wiley in 1938 and won the Cyclists Touring Club (CTC) award for that year. On the Bayliss-Wiley design the freewheel unit was threaded to accept the sprockets. A different four speed design was manufactured by BSA Cycles Ltd in 1949 to accompany their BSA 4 Star derailleur gear. The BSA design had a splined freewheel unit (BSA part No.8-1913) which attached to the hub shell (BSA part No.8-701) and carried four sprockets. Shimano made their first freehub in 1978 in both the Dura-Ace, and 600 (later known as Ultegra) models. It was a significant improvement. It proved to be the first widely used commercially successful freehub. Freehubs, manufactured by various companies, are now common on mid- to high-end bicycles today. Nevertheless, freewheels continue to be fitted on some new bikes, especially single speed, and cheaper models of derailleur bicycles.

Introduction In contrast with traditional epidemiology, computational epidemiology looks for patterns in unstructured sources of data, such as social media. It can be thought of as the hypothesis-generating antecedent to hypothesis-testing methods such as national surveys and randomized controlled trials. A mathematical model is developed which describes the observed behavior of the viruses, based on the available data. Then simulations of the model are performed to understand the possible outcomes given the model used. These simulations produce as results projections which can then be used to make predictions or verify the facts and then be used to plan interventions and meters towards the control of the disease's spread.

Biography  Holt's storehouse (center) Colonial Williamsburg reconstruction Colonial Williamsburg printing office (reconstructed), where Holt learned trade. \\"Ravenscroft site\\" ruins in colonial Williamsburg, home of young Holt. Holt was born in 1721 (exact date unknown), at colonial Williamsburg in the state of Virginia. He received his formal schooling and training as a merchant in the colonial town. His brother- in-law, William Hunter, the \\"public printer\\", likely taught him the printing business there. Holt first became a store shop merchant at Duke of Gloucester street in colonial Williamsburg on lots numbers 49 and 50 in a \\"new store\\" he built about 1745, now known as \\"Holt's storehouse\\" on the north side of the street. He also leased lot numbers 266, 267, 268 and 700 in colonial Williamsburg from Thomas Nelson during 1745 to 1753. He had a house on lots 267 and 268 at the corner of Nicholson and Botetourt Streets, known today as the \\"Ravenscroft Site\\". Holt eventually became the mayor of colonial Williamsburg in November 1752 and served one term from 1752 to 1753. He also held other public positions; from 1748 to 1754 he was Justice of the Peace for York County, Virginia. In 1754 Holt had a negative cash flow problem at his Williamsburg storehouse, where he stocked general merchandise (i.e. groceries, dry goods, sewing items, china), so gave that business up. He then became one of two deputy postmasters-general for the British American colonies. He worked with James Parker as a deputy partner. Holt was quite concerned about the postal system and gave extensive improvement suggestions to Samuel Adams on January 29, 1776, from the practical experience he gained as a deputy postmaster. Part of the letter suggested that the Continental Congress should adequately supply whatever was necessary to provide reliable postal service. Another suggestion Holt recommended was good delivery of all letters to and from soldiers on duty and that they might go free of postage. Holt in the New York Journal or General Advertiser newspaper was the first person in New York to recommend a newsdealers' system for the delivery of newspapers instead of using post riders, which was dangerous. Holt played a role in the early history of the Connecticut Gazette. In 1755 Thomas Clap, President of Yale College, invited Benjamin Franklin to set up a printing press in New Haven, Connecticut. Benjamin Mecom, Clap's nephew, was to operate the press to publish the paper Circumstances changed and Mecom declined to run the publication. Franklin then sold the materials to James Parker, a well-known printer who began the Connecticut Gazette on April 12, 1755; the first newspaper printed in the colony of Connecticut. Holt went to Parker in 1754 with a recommendation letter. Parker gave him a job in the printing business helping publish the Gazette. The front page appeared with the co-partnership name of \\"James Parker and Company\\" on December 13, 1755. Holt became the junior partner and resident editor conducting the printing business of the newspaper publication at New Haven. He also ran the New Haven post office at the same time. Parker spent most of his time at his printing-house in New York City, so was often away from his New Haven businesses – which Holt managed. In 1760 Holt went to New York City to manage Parker's newspaper business there, the New-York Gazette and Weekly Post-Boy. On July 31, 1760, the newspaper appeared with the title of \\"James Parker and Company\\". Holt became James' junior partner in this newspaper, as had previously happened in Connecticut. Both Holt and Parker controlled the post riders from New York City to Hartford, Connecticut. These post riders met the post riders from Boston. The partnership broke up on May 6, 1762. Holt then became the general manager of the newspaper and changed the name to New-York Journal or General Advertiser. He rented the publishing facilities from Parker on a four-year lease. He leased the business from Parker until 1766, moving to \\"the lower End of Broad Street, opposite the Exchange\\" in May 1763. Holt additionally then published books and other materials (i.e. pamphlets, handbills, broadsides) that were generally political. The publications Holt printed reflected his readers' struggle between the colonies and England. He also printed laws and other court actions for the Provincial Congress of New York. He also had a store that sold miscellaneous books on a variety of subjects including religion, freemasonry, economics, history, archaeology, poetry, and biographies. It also sold ink, paper, and other stationery supplies. Holt openly challenged the Stamp Act of 1765 while being the publisher of the New-York Gazette and Weekly Post-Boy. He was the favorite printer of the Sons of Liberty. Holt almost stopped the publication of this newspaper because of the heavy tax he would have to pay the English for stamped paper. The Sons of Liberty, with a threat of bodily harm, persuaded Holt to continue the newspaper in defiance of the tax. Holt then continued the newspaper on unstamped paper and even published for meetings of groups against the Stamp Act. He added to the heading of his newspaper the words > The united voice of all his Majesty's free and loyal subjects in America – > Liberty and property and no stamps. Holt had a close relationship with the Sons of Liberty, which helped him get printing equipment. Once, they bailed him out of debtor's jail with a fee of over £400. The Sons of Liberty even subsidized him to publish the New-York Gazette and Weekly Post-Boy as a Whig newspaper. He changed the name of the paper to New-York Gazette or General Advertiser in May 1766, where he printed his relationship with Parker. Holt learned that Parker would not resume the New-York Gazette and Weekly Post-Boy, so he continued the newspaper using the title until October 9, 1766 (no. 1240). On October 16 of the same year Holt changed the title to New-York Gazette or General Advertiser (no. 1241) and Parker then followed suit with the same number and printed his version of the New-York Gazette or General Advertiser. Parker resumed his original newspaper that he had owned before leasing it to Holt. Holt's newspaper (issue number 1756) discontinued in New York City on August 29, 1776. This was when the British troops were about to occupy New York City. Holt made a fast exit from the city to New Haven, Connecticut, just as the British occupied New York City, leaving behind all his printing equipment and materials, which the British destroyed. Holt went into the printing business in Norfolk, Virginia in 1770, in a shop supervised by his son John Hunter. Holt ran the printing business under his son's name \\"John H. Holt and Company.\\" There he printed the Virginia Gazette (aka the Norfolk Intelligencer). Holt printed some unfavorable remarks about certain ancestors of Lord Dunmore and started a quarrel with him, the royal governor of the colony of Virginia. Dunmore sent fifteen of King George's soldiers to Holt's printing shop and took all of the types and parts of the printing press. In the presence of two to three hundred spectators the soldiers took these printing accessories and carried them back onto Dunmore's ship Eilbeck, offshore. It was rumored that Dunmore wanted to print newspapers himself in vindication. However, he had no ink and only parts of a press, so was unable to print. The soldiers were looking for Holt's son to capture but couldn't find him as he was hiding and eventually escaped the territory. Holt then moved from Connecticut with his family in 1777 and went to Kingston, New York. There he became \\"public printer\\" for the colony of New York. Holt revived his newspaper in Kingston on July 7, 1777, starting with issue number 1757. He printed it until October 13, 1777, ending with issue number 1771. This was three days before the British burned down Kingston. He was only able to save of his personal property and about a sixth of his printing materials which included his account books, paper stock and two excellent font type sets. Holt again continued his newspaper on May 11, 1778, in Poughkeepsie, New York. In this town his newspaper was printed until November 6, 1780. It then restarted on July 30, 1781, and stopped on January 6, 1782. This time the reason it stopped was for the need of printing laws of the Colony of New York. It then resumed again on November 22, 1783, being titled The Independent New-York Gazette. Holt's newspaper was printed then for the rest of his life under this title and variations of that. He criticized British \\"tyrannical designs\\" and taught the colonists how to resist British control. Modern-day historian Edwin Emery labeled Holt \\"the most important Radical printer outside Boston\\" during the American Revolution. Isaiah Thomas, founder of the American Antiquarian Society, described Holt as a \\"man of ardent feelings, and a high churchman, but a firm Whig, a good writer, and a warm advocate of the cause of his country.\\"  Newspaper collection fee problems  Holt had a problem collecting newspaper fees for some fifty years. An example was his attempt to collect subscription fees and advertisement fees from Jonathan Trumbull. Trumbull not only ordered the newspaper subscription on a yearly basis for himself, but ordered it for eleven others, and didn't pay for any of them. After Holt's death in 1784 his widow continued the Independent New-York Gazette newspaper until her death in 1788, when it passed to others and was published until March 8, 1800. Holt's widow also had a lawsuit against the State of New York for unpaid public printing done by Holt during the Revolutionary War.  Family  Holt married Elizabeth Hunter, sister to renowned colonial Williamsburg publisher William Hunter, in 1749. According to biographer Layton Barnes Murphy they had two children: * John Hunter Holt (b. July 1748), became publisher of the Virginia Gazette or the Norfolk Intelligencer. * Elizabeth Holt (b. April 19, 1746), married Eleazer Oswald (editor of Philadelphia Independent Gazette).  Death  Holt died in New York City on 30 January 1784 and was buried in the churchyard of St. Paul's Chapel in New York.

Background The Sky Moves Sideways has been compared to Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here because of their similar structure; both albums have extended pieces at the beginning and end, which are the halves of a single song. The track \\"Moonloop\\" is an edited and overdubbed version of a 40-minute improvisation by the full live band recorded at the Doghouse studio on 28 June 1994; a section unused on the album featured a drum beat that would go on to form the basis of \\"Stars Die.\\" The full length version was released as Transmission IV in 2001. The Sky Moves Sideways was the first Porcupine Tree album to be released in the US (albeit with an altered track list), and the first on which Porcupine Tree was actually a band rather than simply a pseudonym for Steven Wilson. This transition took place while the album was being recorded, so two of the tracks - namely \\"The Moon Touches Your Shoulder\\" and \\"Dislocated Day\\" - are performed entirely by Wilson, while the full band appears on the remainder of the album (including \\"Stars Die\\", a UK single which was added to the US version of the album). In 2004, a new, two CD version of the album was released, featuring newly recorded drums by Gavin Harrison on these two tracks. There are thus three distinct versions of this album - the original UK version, the US version, and the 2004 remaster - no two of which feature the same track list, or the same version of \\"Moonloop\\". Wilson remixed elements of \\"The Colour of Air\\" for use in the track \\"Fuse the Sky\\" during the Signify era on an ambient compilation; it later appeared on Stars Die: The Delerium Years 1991–1997. The guitar progression of \\"Spiral Circus\\" would be reused by Wilson project No-Man for \\"Something Falls,\\" a b-side for their 2001 album Returning Jesus. Release The album was first released in February 1995 in Europe. The album would later release in North America in October 1995, the first album of the band's to do so. The track list would be changed for the album's American release. Besides the addition of \\"Stars Die\\", the different running order and the removal of \\"Prepare Yourself\\", the version of \\"Moonloop\\" on this edition is less than half the length of the one on the UK release. Additionally, the two parts of the title track on this version have been split into a number of sections. The album was remastered and re-released as a two disc collection in 2004, including expanded and demo material. The song \\"The Sky Moves Sideways (Alternate Version)\\" represents outtakes and a work-in-progress mix of the original vision of the album as a single 34-minute track. The version of \\"Moonloop\\" here has three minutes of additional material previously available only on an EP, and is split into two tracks. This is the only version of The Sky Moves Sideways which includes both \\"Prepare Yourself\\" and \\"Stars Die\\". A triple vinyl edition was also released in the same year, by Headspin Music record label, including a 7-inch single with two versions of the song \\"Men of Wood\\", the first was taken from The Sky Moves Sideways recording sessions and the 2000 mix was previously included in the Stars Die: The Delerium Years 1991-1997 compilation. A double vinyl edition was released in 2012 by Kscope. This vinyl edition features a new \\"anti-loudness\\" remaster which is closer to the natural dynamics of the original masters. The track list was the same as the first two LPs of the prior vinyl release, except for a 22-minute version of \\"Moonloop\\" on side four. Reception The album was generally well received. AllMusic praised it for \\"...continuing the excellence of Up the Downstair while achieving a new liquid sense of drama and overall flow.\\", specifically praising the track \\"Stars Die\\".

In AC electrical power systems, a synchroscope is a device that indicates the degree to which two systems (generators or power networks) are synchronized with each other.Terrell Croft, Wilford Summers (ed.), American Electricians' Handbook Eleventh Edition, Mc Graw Hill, 1987 pp. 7-46 - 7-48 For two electrical systems to be synchronized, both systems must operate at the same frequency, and the phase angle between the systems must be zero (and two polyphase systems must have the same phase sequence). Synchroscopes measure and display the frequency difference and phase angle between two power systems. Only when these two quantities are zero is it safe to connect the two systems together. Connecting two unsynchronized AC power systems together is likely to cause high currents to flow, which will severely damage any equipment not protected by fuses or circuit breakers. Operating principles The simplest aid to synchronizing a generator to another system uses lamps wired between similar phases of the two systems; when the lamps stay dark, the voltage and frequency of the two systems are the same and the generator may be connected. However, the accuracy of this approach is low since it is difficult to discern slight phase differences, and the lamps do not show the relative speeds of the two systems. Synchroscopes are instruments that show the relative frequency (speed) difference and the phase angle between the machine to be synchronized and the system voltage. Since most synchroscopes are connected only to a single phase of the two systems, they cannot assure that the phase sequence is correct. When generators are newly connected to a power system, or temporary connections are used, other means are required to assure both systems have the same phase sequence. Some generators use both a synchroscope and a set of two lamps. If the lamps flash out of sequence, then the phase sequence is incorrect. Synchroscopes are electrodynamic instruments, which rely on the interaction of magnetic fields to rotate a pointer. In most types, unlike voltmeters and wattmeters, there is no restoring spring torque for the magnetically produced torques to overcome; the pointer system is free to rotate continually. Synchroscopes have a damping vane to smooth out vibration of the moving system. A polarized-vane synchroscope has a field winding with a phase-shifting network arranged to produce a rotating magnetic field. The field windings are connected to the \\"incoming\\" machine. A single-phase polarizing winding is connected to the \\"running\\" system. It is mounted perpendicular to the field winding and produces a magnetic flux that passes through the moving vanes. The moving vanes turn a shaft that carries a pointer moving over a scale. If the frequency of the source connected to the polarizing winding is different from the source connected to the field winding, the pointer rotates continually at a speed proportional to the difference in system frequencies (the beat frequency). The scale is marked to show the direction of rotation corresponding to the \\"incoming\\" machine running faster than the \\"running\\" system. When the frequencies match, the moving vanes will rotate to a position corresponding to the phase difference between the two sources. The incoming machine can then be adjusted in speed so that the two systems are in phase agreement. In the moving iron instrument, an iron vane is mounted on a shaft along with the pointer. The field winding is a three-phase winding, with the phases connected to both the running and incoming sources through a phase- shifting \\"impedor\\" network containing resistors, capacitors, and inductors. In this instrument, conceptually the field winding produces two rotating magnetic fields due to the running and incoming sources. The iron vane moves in response to the resultant sum of the two fields. The cross-coil synchroscope somewhat resembles a wound-field induction motor. A two-phase rotor winding is connected to the incoming machine source by a phase-shifting network through brushes and slip rings. The stationary field winding is connected to the incoming source. In a Weston pattern synchroscope, the moving element is not free to rotate continuously and oscillates back and forth slowly as the two sources are brought into synchronism. The moving pointer is illuminated by a pilot lamp connected to a three-winding transformer fed by both sources. The pointer is only illuminated at the in-phase condition, thereby distinguishing between in-phase and 180-degree out of phase conditions. All these instruments use single-phase connections to the running and incoming systems to simplify the wiring. For most systems, synchroscopes are connected through voltage transformers to reduce the machine voltage to around 120 volts to operate the instruments. Synchroscopes operate only over a limited range of frequencies, a few per cent above and below the system nominal frequency. Cross-coil type instruments draw a relatively large amount of power from the systems and are intended for only brief operation. The moving-iron and polarized-vane instruments put less burden on the system and can operate for a longer time without overheating. General Electric Electric Instruments Construction and Operating Principles, General Electric Meter and Instrument Department, West Lynn, Mass. 1949, chapter 7 Electronic digital systems can measure and display the phase angle difference directly. The display may be a ring of discrete LEDs arranged to simulate the effect of a pointer moving over a scale, with a different color of LED to indicate the \\"in phase\\" condition. These instruments may also have a relay contact for use by external control circuits, to indicate synchronism. Process of Synchronization An example of synchroscope operation on a hydroelectric generator. Synchroscopes are used in any power plant that connects to an outside power grid and also in isolated plants containing more than one generator. Each generator must be synchronized with the others before being connected to the plant bus. If line voltages are unequal when they are connected, a heavy current will flow as each line will attempt to equalize the other, causing damage in the process. When operators of an electric generator wish to connect it to the grid, they first start the generator spinning at a rate approximately equal to the line frequency of the grid with which they plan to connect. The voltage of the generator is then matched with the grid by adjusting the field/armature current. The synchroscope is connected to the power grid and to the generator being started. If the generator is turning at a lower frequency than the grid, the synchroscope needle rotates continually in the direction (usually counterclockwise) marked \\"slow\\" or \\"lag\\" on the dial to indicate that the generator is running slower than, or lagging behind, the grid. If the generator is running faster than the grid, the needle rotates continually in the opposite direction, marked \\"fast\\" or \\"lead\\". Next, the plant operator adjusts the speed of the generator until it is running at precisely the same speed (frequency) as the grid. As the frequency of the generator nears that of the grid, the synchroscope needle slows down and when the frequencies match, the needle stops rotating. At this point, there is one more task to perform before the generator can be connected to the grid. Although the generator and the grid are now operating at the same frequency, they are not necessarily at the same position in the rotational cycle as each other. If two electrical networks operating at two different phase angles were to be connected to each other, a fault similar to a short circuit would occur and most likely destroy the generator and damage the grid. The position (as opposed to rotation) of the needle on a synchroscope indicates the phase angle between the two systems. The angle between the systems is zero when the synchroscope needle is pointing directly to the line in between the \\"slow\\" and \\"fast\\" markings on the dial. (In the picture example in this article, the zero-phase-angle position is straight upwards, at the \\"twelve o'clock\\" position.) If the needle reads \\"fast,\\" then the plant's generator is slowed down by a very small amount and the needle turns counterclockwise (toward the zero mark). Alternatively, if the needle reads \\"slow,\\" then the plant operator speeds the generator up slightly, and the needle turns clockwise. Slightly before the needle reaches the zero mark, the plant operator returns the generator to the grid frequency in order to stop the needle when it reaches the zero mark. When the needle is at zero and is not moving, the two systems are synchronized. Once the two systems are synchronized, they can be safely connected. Depending on the application and the circuit design, the breaker is closed when the synchroscope is passing through approximately \\"eleven o'clock\\", while traveling slowly in the fast direction, allowing time for the circuit breaker to close, and for the incoming generator to come onto the grid as a source. The purpose of this action is to prevent the possibility of the oncoming generator paralleling onto the grid as a load. This has the potential to cause the generator to operate as a motor which can cause damage to the generator and the prime mover (such as a steam turbine or Diesel engine). The machine may be protected from this occurrence by a \\"reverse power\\" trip. In some power plants, a set of lamps may be connected between the generator and system busses (or between the instrument transformers connected to those busses) as a backup to the synchroscope instrument. The lamps flicker at the difference between system and generator frequency. The lamps can be connected to go dark when the phase voltages are identical and in-phase. Multiengine vehicles In addition to synchronizing generators to power systems, similar frequency- difference indicating instruments are used on multiengine ships and aircraft to allow the operators to exactly synchronize the speed of engines. This helps reduce the noise and vibration due to slight differences, for example, in the speeds of two propellers on an aircraft. In this application a synchroscope responds to slight speed differences that would not be visible on an engine tachometer.

Metapleural glands (also called metasternal or metathoracic glands) are secretory glands that are unique to ants and basal in the evolutionary history of ants. They are responsible for the production of an antibiotic fluid that then collects in a reservoir on the posterior of the ant's alitrunk. These reservoirs are also referred to as the bulla and vary in size between ant species and also between castes of the same species. From the bulla, ants can groom the secretion onto the surface of their exoskeleton. This helps to prevent the growth of bacteria and fungal spores on the ants and inside their nest. Though considered an important component in an ant's immunity against parasites, some ant species have lost the gland during their evolution. These losses correlate with ants that have a 'weaving' lifestyle, such as ants in the genus Oecophylla, Camponotus and Polyrhachis. It was originally suggested that because this weaving lifestyle also tended to involve an arboreal lifestyle that the parasite pressure above ground was not as great as for terrestrial ants, resulting in a reduced selective pressure to keep this antibiotic gland. Recent work suggests instead that these ants may just use other antiparasite defences such as increased grooming and venom. Most male ants are not known to have metapleural glands. It is believed that they benefit from the shared secretions of other ant workers and do not need any themselves. Additionally, slave-making ants do not have metapleural glands though the slave species they use do and it is these ants that groom the slavemakers and their brood.

In addition, ALMC offers research and consulting services that contribute to materiel readiness and improve acquisition and logistics management. Army Logistics Management College was originally established as the Army Logistics Management Center on 1 July 1954. The Logistics Management Center conducted a 12-week Army Supply Management Course, but quickly expanded. On 1 May 1956, the Center was established under the operational control of the Department of the Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics (DCSLOG), adding five new functional courses in management of requirements, procurement, distribution, maintenance, and property disposal to the curriculum. Four months later, the ALMC curriculum expanded again to include correspondence courses and use of accredited instructors in off-campus modes. In September 1958, logistics research and doctrine were added. On 1 August 1962, ALMC was placed under the command of the US Army Materiel Command (AMC). Under AMC, new emphasis was placed on instruction in management of research and development, acquisition management, and on integration of all phases of the life cycle of materiel. In September 1969, ALMC started the bi-monthly publication of Army Logistician magazine, which transitioned on its 40th anniversary issue in the Summer of 2009, into the Army Sustainment Magazine, continuing its tradition as a much sought-after Professional Bulletin for Logisticians and Sustainers around the world. In August 1987, ALMC was redesignated as the US Army Logistics Management College, and on 1 October 1991, ALMC became a Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) school under the command of the US Army Combined Arms Support Command and Fort Lee. In 1992 ALMC assumed responsibility for the program to prepare Captains and First Lieutenants in the Ordnance, Quartermaster, Transportation, Aviation, and Medical branches, for company command and staff positions in multifunctional battalions. Renamed the Combined Logistics Captains Career Course (CLC3) in March 1999, CLC3 became ALMC's premiere course. The ALMC curriculum continued to expand in multifunctional logistics, supply automation management, operational logistics planning and intern development. In September 2002, ALMC received formal accreditation as a non-degree-granting occupational education institution, recognized by the U.S. Department of Education.

He was a founder and first president of the National Geographic Society; a founder and the first president of the Bell Telephone Company which later evolved into AT&T;, at times the world's largest telephone company; a founder of the journal Science, and an advocate of oral speech education for the deaf. One of his daughters, Mabel Gardiner Hubbard, also became the wife of Alexander Graham Bell.  Early life  Hubbard was born, raised and educated in Boston, Massachusetts to Samuel Hubbard (June 2, 1785 – December 24, 1847), a Massachusetts Supreme Court justice, and Mary Greene (April 19, 1790 – July 10, 1827).Gardiner Greene Hubbard genealogy, OurFamilyTree.org website, retrieved September 13, 2013. His younger brother was Charles Eustis Hubbard (1842-1928), who later became the first secretary and clerk of the Bell Telephone Company. Hubbard was a grandson of Boston merchant Gardiner Greene.National Geographic Magazine, February 1898. He was also a descendant of Lion Gardiner, an early English settler and soldier in the New World who founded the first English settlement in what later became the State of New York, and whose legacy includes Gardiners Island which remains in the family. He attended Phillips Academy, Andover, and graduated from Dartmouth in 1841. He then studied law at Harvard, and was admitted to the bar in 1843. Career He first settled in Cambridge and joined the Boston law firm of Benjamin Robbins Curtis. There he became active in local institutions. Hubbard helped establish a city water works in Cambridge, was a founder of the Cambridge Gas Co. and later organized a Cambridge to Boston trolley system. Hubbard also played a pivotal role in the founding of Clarke School for the Deaf in Northampton, Massachusetts. It was the first oral school for the deaf in the United States, and Hubbard remained a trustee for the rest of his life. Hubbard entered the national stage by becoming a proponent for the nationalization of the telegraph system (then a monopoly of the Western Union Company, as he explained) under the U.S. Postal Service stating in an article: \\"The Proposed Changes in the Telegraphic System\\",\\"The Proposed Changes in the Telegraphic System\\", North American Review, July 1873, Vol. 117, No. 240, pp. 80–107. \\"It is not contended that the postal system is free from defects, but that it removes many of the grave evils of the present system, without the introduction of new ones; and that the balance of benefits greatly preponderates in favor of the cheap rates, increased facilities, limited and divided powers of the postal system.\\" During the late 1860s, Hubbard lobbied Congress to pass the U.S. Postal Telegraph Bill known as the Hubbard Bill. The bill would have chartered the U.S. Postal Telegraph Company that would be connected to the U.S. Post Office, but the bill did not pass. To benefit from the Hubbard Bill, Hubbard needed patents which dominated essential aspects of telegraph technology such as sending multiple messages simultaneously on a single telegraph wire. This was called the \\"harmonic telegraph\\" or acoustic telegraphy. To acquire such patents, Hubbard and his partner Thomas Sanders (whose son was deaf) financed Alexander Graham Bell's experiments and development of an acoustic telegraph, which led to his invention of the telephone. Following Curtis's retirement, Hubbard relocated to Washington, D.C. where he continued to practice law for 5 more years. In 1876, he was appointed by President Grant to determine the proper rates for railway mail and he served as a commissioner to the Centennial Exposition. =Bell Telephone Company= Hubbard organized the Bell Telephone Company on July 9, 1877, with himself as president, Thomas Sanders as treasurer and Bell as 'Chief Electrician'. Two days later, he became the father-in-law of Bell when his daughter, Mabel Hubbard, married Bell on July 11, 1877. Gardiner Hubbard was intimately connected with the Bell Telephone Company, which subsequently evolved into the National Bell Telephone Company and then the American Bell Telephone Company, merging with smaller telephone companies during its growth. The American Bell Telephone Company would, at the very end of 1899, evolve into AT&T;, at times the world's largest telephone company. Hubbard has been credited as the entrepreneur who distributed the telephone to the world. =Edison Speaking Phonograph Company= Hubbard also became a principal investor in the Edison Speaking Phonograph Company. When Edison neglected development of the phonograph, which at its inception was barely functional, Hubbard helped his son-in-law, Alexander Graham Bell, organize a competing company in 1881 that developed wax-coated cardboard cylinders and disks for used on a graphophone. These improvements were invented by Alexander Bell's cousin Chester Bell, a chemist, and Charles Sumner Tainter, an optical instrument maker, at Alexander Graham Bell's Volta Laboratory in Washington, D.C. Hubbard and Chester Bell approached Edison about combining their interests, but Edison refused,Paul Israel, Edison, a Life of Invention, p. 282 resulting in the Volta Laboratory Association merging the shares of their Volta Graphophone Company with the company that later evolved into Columbia Records in 1886. =Other projects= Hubbard was also interested in the public side of science. After his move to Washington, he was one of the founders and the first president of the National Geographic Society, serving in that capacity from 1888-1897. Today, the Hubbard Medal is given for distinction in exploration, discovery, and research. In 1897, he also helped to rescue the A.A.A.S, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which was founded in 1848, from financial peril and extinction by enabling its purchase of the (then privately owned) \\"Science\\" magazine, which he also founded, in 1883. He served as a trustee of Columbian University from 1883 until his death. He was a regent of the Smithsonian Institution. He created a large collection of etchings and engravings, which were given by his widow to the Library of Congress with a fund for additions. In 1894, Hubbard was elected a member of the American Antiquarian SocietyAmerican Antiquarian Society Members Directory Personal life Hubbard and his wife, Gertrude, in the 1890s In 1846, Hubbard married Gertrude Mercer McCurdy (1827–1909), the daughter of Robert Henry McCurdy, a prominent New York City businessman, and Gertrude Mercer Lee, who was the niece of Theodore Frelinghuysen, a United States Senator and former vice presidential candidate. Her brother, Richard Aldrich McCurdy, served as president of Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York. Together, they had six children: * Robert Hubbard (1847–1849), who died young. * Gertrude McCurdy Hubbard (1849–1886), who married Maurice Neville Grossmann (1843–1884) * Mabel Gardiner Hubbard (1859–1923), who married Alexander Graham Bell, the son of Alexander Melville Bell, in 1877.\\"Mrs. A.G.

But a large beech tree from its garden still (in 2011) remains. To service his then-modern Cambridge house, Hubbard wanted gas lights, the then-new form of illumination. So he founded the Cambridge Gas Company, now part of NSTAR. After he moved to Washington, D.C. from Cambridge in 1873, Hubbard subdivided his large Cambridge estate. On Hubbard Park Road and Mercer Circle (Mercer was his wife's maiden name), he built large houses designed for Harvard faculty. On nearby Foster Street, he built smaller houses, still with modern amenities, for \\"the better class of mechanic.\\" This neighborhood west of Harvard Square in Cambridge is now both popular and expensive. He died on December 11, 1897 at Twin Oaks, his suburban residence. His funeral was held at the Church of the Covenant in Washington, where he was president of the board of trustees. His widow died during a car accident on October 20, 1909 in Washington, D.C. =Descendants= 1947 photograph of Bell descendants with statue of Bell Through his daughter Gertrude, he was the grandfather of Gertrude Hubbard Grossmann (1882–1919), who married Peter Stuyvesant Pillot (1870–1935), at Hubbard's home, Twin Oaks, in 1903. Their daughter, Rosalie Pillot (1907–1959) was married to Lewis Rutherfurd Stuyvesant (1903–1944), the son of Rutherfurd Stuyvesant, in 1925. After giving birth to a son, they divorced in 1935. Through his daughter Mabel, he was the grandfather of Elsie May Bell (1878–1964), who married Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor of National Geographic fame, Marian Hubbard \\"Daisy\\" Bell (1880–1962), who was married to David Fairchild. and two boys who died in infancy (Edward in 1881 and Robert in 1883). Through his daughter Roberta, he was the grandfather of Grace Hubbard Bell (1884–1979), who was married to Granville Roland Fortescue (1875–1952), an American soldier and Rough Rider who was the cousin of Theodore Roosevelt and son of Robert Roosevelt (born while his biological father was married to his first wife but adopted by him following her death and his marriage to his mother). Grace was the mother of three girls, Marion Fortescue, who married Daulton Gillespie Viskniskki in 1934, Thalia Fortescue Massie (1911–1963), and Kenyon Fortescue Reynolds (1914–1990), better known as actress Helene Whitney. = Legacy = Gardiner Hubbard's life is detailed in the book One Thousand Years of Hubbard History, by Edward Warren Day.Edward Warren Day. \\"One Thousand Years of Hubbard History\\", 1895. He was portrayed by a suitably bewhiskered Charles Coburn in the popular biopic The Story of Alexander Graham Bell (1939). In 1890, Mount Hubbard on the Alaska-Yukon border was named in his honor by an expedition co-sponsored by the National Geographic Society while he was president. The Hubbard Glacier (Greenland) was named after him by Robert Peary. The main school building at the Clarke School for the Deaf, Hubbard Hall, is named after him in his honor. In 1899, a new school on Kenyon Street in Washington, DC was named the Hubbard School in his honor as one of the \\"most public-spirited men of the District, never neglecting an opportunity to advance its interests, but was also a man of great learning and earnestly interested in all educational movements. Mr. Hubbard was the president of the National Geographic Society, a man prominent in science and a man of the highest character.\\" The school has since been closed and demolished.

This information is useful to compilers because strict functions can be compiled more efficiently. Thus, if a function is proven to be strict (using strictness analysis) at compile time, it can be compiled to use a more efficient calling convention without changing the meaning of the enclosing program. Note that a function \`f\` is said to diverge if it returns \\\\\\\\{\\\\bot\\\\\\\\}: operationally, that would mean that \`f\` either causes abnormal termination of the enclosing program (e.g., failure with an error message) or that it loops infinitely. The notion of \\"divergence\\" is significant because a strict function is one that always diverges when given an argument that diverges, whereas a lazy (or non-strict) function is one that may or may not diverge when given such an argument. Strictness analysis attempts to determine the \\"divergence properties\\" of functions, which thus identifies some functions that are strict.  Approaches to strictness analysis  Forward abstract interpretation = Strictness analysis can be characterized as a forward abstract interpretation which approximates each function in the program by a function that maps divergence properties of the arguments onto divergence properties of the results. In the classical approach pioneered by Alan Mycroft, the abstract interpretation used a two-point domain with 0 denoting the set \\\\\\\\{\\\\bot\\\\\\\\} considered as a subset of the argument or return type, and 1 denoting all values in the type. = Demand analysis = The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) uses a backward abstract interpretation known as demand analysis to perform strictness analysis as well as other program analyses. In demand analysis, each function is modelled by a function from value demands on the result to value demands on the arguments. A function is strict in an argument if a demand for its result leads to a demand for that argument. = Projection-based strictness analysis = Projection-based strictness analysis, introduced by Philip Wadler and R.J.M. Hughes, uses strictness projections to model more subtle forms of strictness, such as head- strictness in a list argument. (By contrast, GHC's demand analysis can only model strictness within product types, i.e., datatypes that only have a single constructor.) A function f is considered head-strict if f = f \\\\circ \\\\pi, where \\\\pi is the projection that head-evaluates its list argument. There was a large body of research on strictness analysis in the 1980s.

An operational/strategic simulation of the Western Front between June and September, 1944, the game simulates the invasion by the Allies of France while it was occupied by the Axis Powers. The title references the Normandy Landings in France on 6 June 1944, but it is actually about the campaign to liberate France in World War II, while the invasion itself is a fairly perfunctory affair completed on the first turn. One unique aspect of the game offers the Allied player the choice of where to invade. Players may (and often do) choose the Normandy beach where the actual invasion took place, but are free to invade at several other alternate locations, including the southern coast of France. The German player has considerable freedom as to where to place his starting pieces, but they do so without knowledge of where the Allied player will invade. Although other games with much more complexity and realism have since been released, including Avalon Hill's early 1980s Fortress Europa covering roughly the same scale and subject matter, D-Day is still played in part due to its simplicity. Along with Stalingrad and Afrika Korps, it was considered one of the \\"classic\\" games released in the 1960s by Avalon Hill, all of which shared a similar move-attack-advance game system.

History The company was founded on March 15, 1926 by Leopoldo Gori and Carlo Zucchi, in the city of Arezzo, with the idea to apply industrial methodologies to goldsmithing, aiming to minimize the costs of metal work. The name UnoAErre comes from 1AR, the identification mark indicated on the punch affixed to products, assigned to the first goldsmith company of Arezzo (AR). In the sixties production reached the highest levels, and the company employed more than 1200 staff. It began a reduction of its workforce in the early 1970s. Today fewer than 500 are employed. The company passed from the hands of families Gori-Zucchi to Morgenf Enfield (Deutsche Bank Group) in the mid 1990s, and was regained by Zucchi family with the help of a group of banks. Operations were subsequently moved to a new factory. In 2008, the company revisited its practices to manufacture items that are lighter an dthat contain less gold and expanded into the production of accessories, rather than just sticking to traditional jewelry. Museum UnoAErre also operates a museum with works of the artists who have collaborated in the production of its jewelry, including Pietro Cascella, Salvador Dalí and Salvatore Fiume.

He also managed Royal Daring of Belgium and coached the Belgium national team. Football career Born in Colombo (in what is now Sri Lanka) to English parents, Butler moved back to Britain as a child. He played for Dartford and Fulham Thursday as a youth, before signing for Fulham in 1913 and moving to Arsenal in 1914. He played in Arsenal's' reserve side in his first season, before World War I intervened. Butler duly signed up for the Royal Artillery and served in France during the war, and returned to Arsenal after the end of hostilities. By then he had come of age, and with the resumption of first-class football, he made his first-team debut for Arsenal, against Bolton Wanderers on 15 November 1919. A tall, elegant and clean player, Butler initially played as a traditional \\"centre half\\" — i.e. as a central, deep-lying midfielder; he was in competition with Arsenal's' regular centre halves, Chris Buckley and Alex Graham, but by 1924-25, he was the undisputed first-choice centre half, playing in all but three games of the club's League campaign that season. He also won his first and only cap for England, against Belgium on 8 December 1924. He made a total of 296 appearances for Arsenal, scoring eight goals. After Arsenal he joined Torquay United, and stayed there for two seasons before becoming a coach at Belgian club Royal Daring, and was coach of the Belgian national side.

He has earned the reputation of being an eccentric goalkeeper by often dribbling the ball past the opposition's strikers and by making somewhat unorthodox saves. Early in his career, Costanzo was once considered an excellent prospect; however, due to a few lengthy injuries, he has only recently managed to fulfill his full potential. Club career Costanzo started playing professionally with Buenos Aires giants Club Atlético River Plate in 2000 and made his first-team debut in 2001. He had become the first choice goalkeeper by 2002 and was looked upon by many as one of the most talented goalkeepers in South America. However, injury started to plague him and when he returned from the sidelines, Germán Lux had established himself as River Plate's Number 1. His search for first-team action then took him to Spain's La Liga as he transferred to Deportivo Alavés in 2005. He was first choice at Alavés straight away, but when they were relegated into the Segunda División, he asked the manager, José María Salmerón, to be put on the transfer list. Swiss side FC Basel acquired his services in July 2006 for £1.4 million after the departure of veteran goalkeeper Pascal Zuberbühler. His Basel career did not get off to a great start; he made a blunder in his first match against FC St. Gallen on 30 July 2006 in the 3–2 away defeat. However, he played excellent in the second half of the 2006–07 season and was voted the FCB Player of the Year. He earned much praise during the 2007–08 season for his form as Basel became Champions and especially for his part in helping the team earn a valuable UEFA Cup away point against NK Dinamo Zagreb in the hostile atmosphere of the Maksimir Stadium on 8 November 2007. On 17 July 2008, the day before the 2008–09 Swiss Super League season kicked off, he was named Basel captain and he signed a new contract until 2011.Basler Zeitung, 17 July 2008 His first game as captain was on 18 July 2008, in a 2–1 win over BSC Young Boys at the Stade de Suisse, Wankdorf, in which he was named Man of the Match. On 9 August 2009, Costanzo and teammate Beg Ferati were involved in a scuffle after a 1–1 with FC Zürich. The pair began arguing on the pitch, and then Ferati shoved Costanzo who responded by pulling Ferati's hair. Other players then pulled them apart before the situation escalated. Costanzo was fined by the club and given a three match ban by the Swiss Football Association. Costanzo played for FC Basel for five years, in which time they won the Swiss Cup three times and the national Championship also three times. He also played twice in the Champions League group-stages in the 2008–09 season and the 2010/–11 season where FC Basel did a couple of huge sensations like the draw in the Nou Camp in Barcelona where they tied 1–1 or in the Stadio Olimpico in Rome where they beat AS Roma 3–1. During this period he played 141 league games, including cup and international games he had over 200 club appearances. He played his last match for the team on 25 May 2011 and was substituted out in the 87th minute to a standing ovation. He was replaced by his designated successor Yann Sommer. On 9 June 2011, it was revealed that Costanzo came to an agreement with Greek champions Olympiacos FC for a three- year contract. Six months later, on 26 January 2012, Costanzo's contract was terminated by mutual consent. On 21 May 2012, Costanzo retired from professional football without saying clearly the reason of his decision. On 29 June 2013, Costanzo returned to football signing for Universidad Católica a one-and-a-half-year contract. International career Costanzo was an Argentine international at Under-20 level, and was part of the Argentina squad that took part at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship. At senior level, he made his only main team appearance in Argentina's 4–2 2006 World Cup Qualifying win over Uruguay at the River Plate Stadium on 9 October 2004. Personal life Costanzo is married to Carla. The couple have three children. Their two daughters are named Emma and Zoe and their son named Ciro was born on 24 May 2011.

This is done to relieve intractable pain in a joint which cannot be managed by pain medication, splints, or other normally indicated treatments. The typical causes of such pain are fractures which disrupt the joint, severe sprains, and arthritis. It is most commonly performed on joints in the spine, hand, ankle, and foot. Historically, knee and hip arthrodeses were also performed as pain- relieving procedures, but with the great successes achieved in hip and knee arthroplasty, arthrodesis of these large joints has fallen out of favour as a primary procedure, and now is only used as a procedure of last resort in some failed arthroplasties.  Method  Arthrodesis can be done in several ways: *A bone graft can be created between the two bones using a bone from elsewhere in the person's body (autograft) or using donor bone (allograft) from a bone bank. http://bonebank.com/ **Bone autograft is generally preferred by surgeons because, as well as eliminating the risks associated with allografts, bone autograft contains native bone-forming cells (osteoblasts), so the graft itself forms new bone (osteoinductive), as well as acting as a matrix or scaffold to new bone growing from the bones being bridged (osteoconductive). The main drawback of bone autograft is the limited supply available for harvest. **Bone allograft has the advantage of being available in far larger quantities than autograft; however, the treatment process the bone goes through following harvest, which usually involves deep-freezing and may also involve demineralization, irradiation and/or freeze-drying, kills living bone or bone marrow cells. This significantly reduces the immunogenicity (risk of graft rejection) such that no antirejection drugs are needed, and combined with appropriate donor screening practices, these processing and preservation practices can significantly reduce the risk of disease transmission. In spite of all of this processing, cancellous allograft bone retains its osteoconductive properties. Furthermore, certain processing practices have been shown to also retain the acid-stable osteoinductive proteins in cortical bone grafts, so that many bone allografts can be considered both osteoconductive and osteoinductive. *A variety of synthetic bone substitutes are commercially available. These are usually hydroxyapatite- or tricalcium phosphate-based granules formed into a coralline or trabecular structure to mimic the structure of cancellous bone. They act solely as an osteoconductive matrix. Some manufacturers have recently begun supplying these products with soluble bone-forming factors such as bone morphogenetic protein to attempt to create a synthetic product with osteoinductive properties. *Metal implants can be attached to the two bones to hold them together in a position which favors bone growth. *A combination of the above methods is also commonly employed to facilitate bony fusion. At the completion of surgery and healing, which takes place over a period of several weeks to over a year, the two adjoining bones are fused and no motion takes place between them. This can have the effect of strengthening the bones, as in anterior cervical fusion. Use in horses Arthrodesis is used in horses as a salvage procedure to treat severe breakdown injuries, such as failure of the suspensory apparatus, subluxation, fracture, or collateral ligament rupture. It is also performed in horses suffering from osteoarthritis, primarily of the distal hock joints, to fuse these low-motion joints so they no longer produce pain for the animal.

It is commonly found throughout the Mediterranean region, ranging from southern Iberia to southwest and central Asia, hence the name. Specimens from central Asia are also known by the binomial name Latrodectus lugubris; that name, however, is now considered improper, though it is still commonly found in the literature. Latrodectus tredecimguttatus was previously considered a subspecies of Latrodectus mactans. Description L. tredecimguttatus is black in color, similar to most other widow species, and is identified by the thirteen spots which are found on its dorsal abdomen (the species name is Latin for \\"with thirteen spots\\"). These spots are usually red in colour, but may also be yellow or orange. It is otherwise similar to other species in the genus Latrodectus. The Mediterranean widow primarily lives in steppes and other grasslands, and can be a significant problem in areas where grain is harvested by hand. The female of the species has a body length of about , while the male is smaller and reaches at best. Only the female spider's bite is dangerous (either for humans or cattle) as the male cannot penetrate the relatively thick epidermis. Toxicity Like all Latrodectus species, L. tredecimguttatus has a painful bite that is fatal in rare cases. They are not in close association with humans generally, although epidemics of bites have been reported.Bettini, S. (1964). Epidemiology of latrodectism. Toxicon, 2(2), 93–102. There are many reports of Ukrainian farm workers receiving bites while working in the fields. The LD-50 of L. tredecimguttatus venom has been measured as 0.59 mg/kg, and separately again as 0.59 mg/kg (with a confidence interval of 0.33–1.06). In Kazakhstan - where it has the common name karakurt (= black insect) - there are reports of this species biting and killing camels.

He is well known as the author of the Chung Kuo novels. He is also the co-author (with Rand and Robyn Miller) of the three Myst novels. Biography Wingrove worked in the banking industry for seven years until he became fed up with it. He then attended the University of Kent, Canterbury, where he read English and American Literature. He is married and, with his wife Susan, has four daughters: Jessica, Amy, Georgia, and Francesca. Career Between 1972 and 1982 he wrote over 300 unpublished short stories and 15 novels. He started work on a new fictional project called A Perfect Art. Between 1984 and 1988, when it was first submitted, the title was changed twice, becoming first A Spring Day at the Edge of the World and then finally Chung Kuo, under which title it was sold to 18 publishers throughout the world. The Chung Kuo series ran to eight of nine planned volumes before the series was cancelled and the author had to prematurely finish the story in the eighth volume, which both he and readers found unsatisfying.David Wingrove's assessment of the series In 2008, Nicolas Cheetham at Quercus Publishing bought the rights to the series and planned an ambitious reprinting and repackaging of the sequence, 'recasting' it as eighteen shorter novels (including a radically re-written finale) and an all-new prequel novel, provisionally entitled When China Comes. Quercus Publishing abandoned the project after Mr. Cheetham left, but Mr. Cheetham reacquired it for his new publishers, Corvus Atlantic, in 2009.Bookseller report The reissuing of the series was planned to run from September 2010 to May 2014, commencing with the prequel novel, now retitled Son of Heaven.Corvus Autumn 2010 catalogue However, this was followed by news of a delay to Spring 2011 and the addition of a second prequel novel, Daylight on Iron Mountain.Interstellar Tactics blog Wingrove also has plans for further novels, including a first person character novel called Dawn in Stone City set in the Chung Kuo setting.

Gia-Fu Feng (; 19191985) was prominent as both an English translator (with his wife, Jane English) of Taoist classics and a Taoist teacher in the United States, associated with Alan Watts, Jack Kerouac, The Beats and Abraham Maslow.  Early life  He was born in Shanghai in 1919 into a fairly wealthy family of some influence. His father was a prominent banker, one of the founders of the Bank of China; his mother died when he was 16. He was educated privately in his own home in the classics of the Chinese tradition and in private boarding schools. He was for several months tutored by the wife of the British Consul-General. His family members were Buddhist. For the springtime holiday, they traveled to the ancestral tombs in Yuyao, in Chekiang Province, for the spring festivals. During the Japanese invasion, Gia-Fu went to Kunming in Free China to complete his bachelor's degree at Southwest Associated University in the liberal arts. Gia-Fu once commented that he had become a millionaire three times in his life, giving his money away each time. The first time was when he worked for the bank in Kunming.  Career  After he returned to Shanghai in 1946, he left again in 1947, to go to the U.S. for a master's degree in international finance at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. After the communists took over China and the Korean War began, U.S. policy kept many Chinese students from returning home. Then, when Chinese Communist Party policies made life for the Feng family less certain, his father advised him to stay in the U.S. During the Cultural Revolution, some members of his family were persecuted. After this, he started wandering across the country “in an old jalopy”. He spent some time in a Quaker community, lived in a Georgia commune during the time of the Supreme Court decision in Brown v The Topeka Board of Education, and in the mid-fifties moved to the West Coast. There, he 'hung out' with Jack Kerouac and other Dharma Bums, and began teaching Taoism. Initially he translated Chinese classics for Alan Watts at the American Academy of Asian Studies, the center where Alan Watts served as administrator and primary teacher. Watts was later to state that Gia-Fu was “The Real Thing”, sending aspiring Beat-and-Hippie Taoists to him. Watts' championing of Gia-Fu as a genuine Taoist Adept substantially abetted sales of Gia-Fu and his wife, Jane English's classic Taoist philosophy, coffee-table picture-books, which were published by Random House in many languages. Gia-Fu and Jane's books contained Jane's artistic black-and-white photos in conjunction with his outstanding calligraphy and readily understood wisdom translations. They initiated an important segment of what would become for the global book industry a highly popular, multicultural spirituality and philosophy genre. They also foreshadowed a trend toward multi-media usage in an emergent, classy, holistic marketplace. Calligraphy by Gia-Fu Feng, from the cover of the book Tao-Te- Ching Gia-Fu became involved in the East-West philosophy and spirituality movement that occurred in Northern California, centered by the evolution of the AAAS, reformed as the California Institute of Integral Studies. This was part of a core sociocultural transformation that became known as the San Francisco Renaissance. Regarding that, Alan Watts stated, “I know what it is, but when you ask me, I don't. I am too close to what has happened to see it in proper perspective. I know only that between, say, 1958 and 1970 a huge tide of spiritual energy in the form of poetry, music, philosophy, painting, religion, communications techniques in radio, television, and cinema, dancing, theater, and general life-style swept out of this city and its environs to affect America and the whole world.” Michael Murphy, a primary founder of Esalen Institute, was also a student at the AAAS during his Stanford student days. From this network, including the community of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in San Francisco, the seeds of Esalen were planted. Gia-Fu was drawn to Esalen by his close friend Dick Price. At Esalen, Gia-Fu served as accountant, “Keeper of the Baths” and Crazy Taoist, a few stories of which can be found in the entertaining and informative history of Esalen and birth of the human potential movement, The Upstart Spring. During the early and mid-1960s Gia-Fu and Fritz Perls, arguably Esalen's key resident teacher during that era, had a difficult relationship, with Perls being the primary reason Gia-Fu left Esalen only after creating the original Stillpoint retreat center on Bear Creek Road and Skyline in the Los Gatos/Santa Cruz Mountains. Where he and Jane English translated the Tao Te Ching between 1968-1972. This version is still the most popular English version with over 1,250,000 copies sold. There, Gia-Fu held Perls in high esteem, and was very distraught when Perls died in 1970. Perls' Gestalt Therapy and method of enlightenment became a primary influence in Gia- Fu's later work. Gia-Fu also viewed Virginia Satir, a famous resident teacher of Esalen, and her practice of Family therapy as a primary influence in his own advancement of such, which he termed “Cultural Therapy.” To illustrate how different people perceived Gia-Fu, one person writes: Toward the end of the 1960s Gia-Fu gained a great degree of notoriety as a Patriarch of the Countercultural Free Love movement. As a hippie-beaded, Chinese Guru and Taoist Adept, he became popular as a focus for newspapers and magazines around California. At the time, Taoist-Buddhist Yoga was not popularly known, and Gia-Fu effectively acted as the primary agent or Master in America teaching such. He founded his own center of Taoist studies in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and called it Stillpoint, after T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets. Gia-Fu and Stillpoint soon proved to be a magnet for aspiring Indian Yoga-meets- Chinese Tao seekers. His biographer views this phase of his life very differently, understanding that Gia-Fu shunned guru-type associations and yearned to create a community where people lived simply, honestly, together in nature. He loved to call himself a charlatan. On Christmas Day, 1970, Gia-Fu and Jane English were married in Mill Valley in a ceremony performed by Alan Watts. In 1972 Gia-Fu and Jane moved Stillpoint to Manitou Springs, Colorado, purchasing a very large, old house on Ruxton Ave close to the foot of Barr Trail leading up to Pikes Peak. Residents paid either a nominal fee for room and board ($5/day in 1975) or did needed maintenance work on the rambling house and outbuildings. From there, he and Jane finished the translation of the Chuang Tzu. He became something of a legend as the Chinese Master who would walk up daily along the Pike's Peak Cog Railway track. In the spring of 1978, after an intensive two years of challenging his students (using a great amount of what is traditionally called in China, Lung Ch'i, roaring in a compassionate and awakening way) yet not finding them suitable for the engagement of what in Chan/Zen tradition is termed Dharma transmission, Gia-Fu enlisted the assistance of a Tibetan Buddhist Rimpoche to stay for 100 days at Stillpoint. By this period, Gia-Fu's students were primarily Germans, other Europeans, and the mysterious Lasso, a young American who became Gia-Fu's favorite and protégé in the early 1980s. During the last eight years of his life, Gia-Fu devoted most of his teaching effort to holding Tao Camps in Europe, Canada, Australia, and the final incarnation of the Stillpoint ranch near Wetmore, Colorado, teaching T'ai chi and Shing-i and, more broadly, the Tao.  Death  Gia-Fu died in 1985, most likely of emphysema. He left behind him several unpublished manuscripts including the I-Ching, The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic (of Medicine), and a partial, stream-of-consciousness autobiography. He left his matters in the care of Margaret Susan Wilson, friend and Stillpoint attorney. Sue Bailey, his partner at the time of his death (he and Jane parted company earlier, but never divorced) had the I Ching published in Australia. When Margaret Susan died in 1991, his estate passed to Carol Wilson, Margaret's sister. Carol's award-winning biography, Still Point of the Turning World: The Life of Gia-fu Feng, was released by Amber Lotus Publishing in April, 2009. also http://www.carolannwilson.info Gia-Fu's translation of the Tao Te Ching remains popular and widely available. It includes photos by his wife, Jane English. Like his translation of Chuang Tsu, the translation was a collaboration between them with participation by other students.

There is inevitably some amount of focus error, but too small to be considered significant. Microscopy Parfocal microscope objectives stay in focus when magnification is changed; i.e., if the microscope is switched from a lower power objective (e.g., 10×) to a higher power objective (e.g., 40×), the object stays in focus. Most modern bright-field microscopes are parfocal. Photography Zoom lenses (sometimes referred to as \\"true\\" zoom) are ideally parfocal, in that focus is maintained as the lens is zoomed (i.e., focal length and magnification changed), which is convenient and has the advantage of allowing more accurate focusing at maximal focal length then zooming back to a shorter focal length to compose the image. Many zoom lenses, particularly in the case of fixed-lens cameras, are actually varifocal lenses, which gives lens designers more flexibility in optical design trade-offs (e.g., focal length range, maximal aperture, size, weight, cost) than parfocal zoom, which is practical because of auto-focus, and because the camera processor can automatically adjust the lens to keep it in focus while changing focal length (\\"zooming\\"), making operation practically indistinguishable from a parfocal zoom. Cinematography Zoom lenses used for moviemaking applications must have the parfocal ability in order to be of practical use. It is almost impossible to stay in correct focus (as done manually by the focus puller) while zooming. This could be possible theoretically, but if the subject and/or camera also move, there are too many variables to correct consistently. Telescopy Parfocal telescope eyepieces stay in focus when magnification is changed; i.e., if the telescope is switched from a lower- power eyepiece (e.g., 10×) to a higher-power eyepiece (e.g., 20×), or vice versa, the object stays in focus.

The term is used elsewhere (such as in British and Australian contexts) to refer to a professional sportsman who plays for numerous clubs during their career. In Britain, the term is also used derogatorily, along with mercenary, to refer to players who join various affluent clubs purely in search of higher contractual payouts rather than to further their career; usually clubs which they would likely never join otherwise. American English Journeymen often make up a large part of a team, because it is almost always economically non-viable for even the richest teams in sports without salary caps to have a roster made up fully of superstar players and because such a scenario would likely not occur even with economic viability because of the lack of attention some players would end up getting. This is especially true in the context of baseball, where journeymen often make up large parts of a team's pitching staff and contribute crucially to a team's success. Many journeymen can be highly experienced, and they often play a \\"utility\\" role to cover for injuries or tactical changes as required. The term is also used in this context for boxing journeymen. Journeymen players are usually distinguished from an elite or \\"star\\" player. Quirk and Fort note that the concerns of journeymen players and superstars, with respect to contract and other negotiations, differ: Superstars are concerned with the preservation of their rights to be free agents, whilst journeymen players are concerned with issues such as league minimum salaries and player pensions. Fort observes that this leads to conflicts between journeymen and superstars, such as (Fort's example) the 1995 attempt by a group of superstar players to derail the agreement between the NBA and its players' association. Holt and Mason note that in football, golf, flat racing, snooker, cricket, and other sports there is a clear distinction in earnings between the few rich stars in each sport and the journeyman professionals. They state that snooker has \\"an élite of perhaps twenty players\\" and point to a distinction between high earning test cricketers with six figure wages and \\"the average county professional\\" (for whom they give Simon Hughes, who earned £50,000 in the whole of his twelve years in county cricket, as an example). Vamplew describes how league cricket in the 1890s provided little attraction for star cricketers but was greatly attractive to journeymen players in county cricket, eventually forcing the counties to raise their conventional maximum wage, offer winter pay to more players, and expand the fixture lists. O'Leary notes as significant the fact that whilst star football players will be treated with lenience by clubs, for journeyman footballers the taking of recreational drugs usually terminates their careers. (He gives Roger Stanislaus and Craig Whitington as examples.) Clubs will regard it as worthwhile to wait for stars to become available for team selection after suspension or imprisonment, but not for journeymen. British English Lutz Pfannenstiel played for 27 clubs on six continents. In British English, a journeyman is a player who has represented many clubs over his career. Prime examples from association football are: German goalkeeper Lutz Pfannenstiel, who represented 27 clubs, and he is currently the only athlete to have played professionally in all six FIFA Confederations; Trevor Benjamin, who has represented 29 clubs since 1995; Drewe Broughton, who has made 18 transfers in his career; John Burridge, who played for 29 clubs in a career spanning almost 30 years; there is Jefferson Louis who, since the 1990s, has represented 34 clubs and Dominica once; and his cousin Richard Pacquette who boasts 19 clubs and even international honours in 10 seasons. The term is also used in Australian English and New Zealand English in the same context. The term is also used derogatorily, along with mercenary, to refer to players who join various affluent clubs purely in search of higher contractual payouts, clubs which they would likely never join otherwise. There is no convention for the number of transfers required for a player to be considered a journeyman or a mercenary and as such is an arbitrary epithet given by those who resent the player's actions. Journeymen's direct opposite, players who play for the same club, or only a few different clubs, throughout their entire careers, are called one-club men.

Waldron, a U.S. Naval aviator who led a squadron of torpedo bombers in World War II. Construction and commissioning Waldron was laid down on 16 November 1943 at Kearny, New Jersey, by the Federal Shipbuilding & Drydock Co.; launched on 26 March 1944; sponsored by Miss Nancy Waldron; and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 7 June 1944, Commander George E. Peckham in command. United States service historyWorld War II: 1944= Waldron conducted shakedown in the vicinity of Bermuda during the early summer of 1944. She conducted post-shakedown availability at New York from 22 July until 6 August and then headed back to the Bermuda area for further training. The destroyer returned to New York in mid-September but got underway again on 26 September. Steaming via the Delaware capes, the warship arrived at the Panama Canal on 1 October. She transited the canal that same day and reported for duty with the Pacific Fleet. She departed Balboa on 4 October, stopped at San Pedro, California, from 12 to 14 October, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 20 October. She remained in the Hawaiian Islands until 17 December, at which time she got underway for the western Pacific. She arrived at Ulithi lagoon on 28 December and reported for duty in the screen of the Fast Carrier Task Force (TF-38/58). =World War II: 1945= Waldron spent her entire World War II service with the fast aircraft carriers. She departed Ulithi with TF 38 on 30 December and protected the carriers while they launched their planes against enemy installations on 3 and 4 January 1945. On 6–7 January, her charges' aircraft pummeled targets on the island of Luzon. Both raids were part of the preparations for the amphibious assault on Luzon carried out at Lingayen Gulf on 9 January. While the troops stormed ashore there, however, Waldron and the carriers had returned north to suppress enemy air power on Formosa during the actual assault. That same day, she steamed through Bashi Channel into the South China Sea with TF 38 to begin a series of raids on Japan's inner defenses. First on the agenda came Cam Ranh Bay in Indochina, where Admiral Halsey hoped to find battleships and . Unknown to the American fleet, however, was the fact that the two Japanese warships had moved south to safer waters at Singapore. The raids went forward anyhow on 12 January, and the naval aviators still managed to rack up a stupendous score: 44 ships sunk, 15 of which were Japanese combatants and the remainder being merchant ships. After fueling on 13 January, TF 38, with Waldron still in the screen, carried out air attacks on Hainan Island and on Hong Kong. The following day, the planes of TF 38 returned to Formosa for antishipping sweeps and attacks on the Formosa airfields. On 16 January, the carriers launched their planes against Hainan and Hong Kong once more. Late on 20 January, Waldron the antimine and antisubmarine patrol—led TF 38 out of the South China Sea through Balintang Channel and into the Philippine Sea. The destroyer and her charges returned to their base at Ulithi on the 26th after conducting strikes on Formosa and on Okinawa. Waldron remained at Ulithi until 10 February at which time she got underway again with TF 58, this time to support the assault on Iwo Jima scheduled for the 19th. As a part of that support, the carriers planned to carry out the first carrier-based air strikes on Japan since the Doolittle Raid of 1942. On 16 and 17 February, the carriers of TF 58 sent their aircraft aloft for raids on the Tokyo area of Honshū. The task force then began its retirement to Iwo Jima, there to provide air support for the following day's invasion. On the night of 17 and 18 February, Waldrons task group encountered several small Japanese patrol craft. One of the craft attacked with her 3-inch guns, killing three of the destroyer's crewmen. Due to darkness and the proximity of Dortch and , Waldron could not bring her battery to bear. Instead, she laid on a course for the enemy craft and charged her at . At about 0509 on 18 February, Waldron rammed the Japanese picket boat amidships and cut her neatly in two. About four hours later, the destroyer received orders detaching her from TF 58 to head for Saipan and repairs to her bow. Waldron off Okinawa, in April-May 1945. The warship arrived at Saipan on 20 February, completed repairs quickly, and departed Saipan in the afternoon of 23 February. Upon arrival off Iwo Jima on 25 February, Waldron reported to TF 51 for temporary duty with the transport screen. During that assignment, she also provided naval gunfire support for the troops operating ashore on 26 and 27 February. On 27 February, the destroyer rejoined the screen of TG 58.3. After an air strike on Okinawa on 1 March, she headed back to Ulithi with the carriers, arriving there on 4 March. Ten days later, Waldron exited the lagoon once again on her way back to the Japanese home islands with the fast carriers. She arrived in Japanese home waters on 18 March, and the carriers began launching strikes on Kyushu airfields that same day. Later that day, the enemy counterattacked with kamikazes and succeeded in hitting the aircraft carrier . Waldron was one of the ships assigned to cover the severely damaged carrier during the initial stage of her retirement from action. Antiaircraft action continued throughout the three days Waldron provided escort for Franklin; and, on the night of 20 and 21 March, the destroyer scored a kill of her own when her radar-directed main battery brought down a Japanese Yokosuka D4Y \\"Judy.\\" She took another intruder under fire briefly that night, but technical problems prevented a second kill. On 22 March, she rejoined the main carrier force and resumed her screening duties while the planes struck at Okinawa and Kyushu in preparation for the invasion of Okinawa. For the next three months, Waldron continued to screen the carriers during their support missions for the Okinawa campaign. During that time, she was engaged in a number of antiaircraft actions and participated in two shore bombardments of air installations on Minami Daito Shima. The one antiaircraft action which resulted in a definite kill for the destroyer occurred on 14 May, although she claimed four sure assists in addition during that period. On 26 May, she cleared the Ryukyu Islands with her task group and, on 1 June, arrived at San Pedro Bay, Leyte, for a much-needed availability. The destroyer remained at San Pedro Bay until 1 July at which time she returned to sea with TF 38. For the remainder of World War II, she steamed with the fast carriers during the final strikes on the Japanese home islands. The 15 August cessation of hostilities found her still off the Japanese coast in company with TF 38. She screened the carriers while their aircraft covered the initial occupation of Japan. That duty lasted until 10 September, at which time she finally entered Tokyo Bay. =Post-World War II= During the immediate postwar period, Waldron remained in the Far East in support of American occupation forces. In addition to Japan, she visited Saipan, Eniwetok, and Okinawa during the repatriation of Japanese—both military and civilian—back to Japan. On 4 November, she departed Okinawa, bound for home. After stops at Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, the warship arrived at San Francisco on 20 January 1946. From there, she moved to Portland, Oregon, whence she departed on 4 February. The destroyer transited the Panama Canal on 14 February and arrived in Norfolk, Virginia on 19 February. Waldron operated along the east coast of the United States for about three months. Early in May, she began an extended repair period at the Boston Naval Shipyard and did not return to active service until the end of the year. During the first few months of 1947, the destroyer operated out of Charleston, South Carolina; but, by June, she had been reassigned to New Orleans. For the next two years, she cruised the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the West Indies as a training platform for reservists of the 8th Naval District. In August 1949, she made a visit to Norfolk, before getting underway for a deployment to European waters on 6 September. During the first part of that deployment, Waldron cruised northern European waters visiting British and western European ports. Midway through November, however, she transited the Straits of Gibraltar and entered the Mediterranean Sea. She cruised the length and breadth of the Mediterranean, making a number of port visits, until 28 January 1950 when she retransited the Straits of Gibraltar. She arrived back in Norfolk on 7 February but remained only until 16 February on which day she made the brief voyage to Charleston. Following pre- inactivation overhaul, Waldron was decommissioned on 17 May 1950 and was berthed with the Charleston Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet. =Korean War= Less than six weeks later, however, events in the Far East transpired which brought her back into active service before the end of the year. On 25 June, the forces of communist North Korea invaded the Republic of Korea to the south. The compelling need to send most available active combat ships to the Far East to support the United States and United Nations commitment to help the South Koreans meant that many others in reserve had to be reactivated to take their places. Accordingly, the decision to reactivate Waldron came on 17 August, just three months after her decommissioning. On 20 November 1950, Waldron was recommissioned at Charleston, Commander James C. Shaw in command. She conducted shakedown training out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, from December 1950 to March 1951. After post-shakedown availability at Charleston, she moved to her new home port, Norfolk, in August. In September, she departed Norfolk for a 10-week cruise to northern European waters before entering the Mediterranean for duty with the 6th Fleet. Early in February 1952, the destroyer returned to Norfolk and resumed 2nd Fleet operations from that base. During the summer of 1952, Waldron voyaged to Europe once more with Naval Academy midshipmen embarked for their summer training cruise. She completed that voyage in September and returned to Atlantic Fleet duty out of Norfolk. In March 1953, the warship began an overhaul at the Charleston Naval Shipyard. She completed repairs in June and conducted refresher training in the Guantanamo Bay operating area before resuming normal operations out of Norfolk at the end of the month. On 2 November, the destroyer departed Norfolk for a tour of duty in the Far East. She transited the Panama Canal on the 9th and continued her voyage west. She stopped at Pearl Harbor along the way and arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 9 December. Her duty in the Orient took her to Japanese and Korean ports, and she served as a unit of the United Nations security forces on patrol in the wake of the cessation of hostilities in Korea the previous summer. That assignment lasted until 7 April 1954, at which time she departed Sasebo for home. Steaming via Hong Kong, Singapore, Ceylon, the Suez Canal, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Atlantic Ocean, Waldron completed a circumnavigation of the globe at Norfolk on 4 June. =1954–1967= In July, the ship resumed normal operations along the east coast and in the West Indies. That duty continued until the spring of 1956. On 1 April, she stood out of Chesapeake Bay on her way to the Mediterranean for her second tour of duty with the 6th Fleet. Over the next decade, Waldron alternated operations out of Norfolk with a series of deployments to the 6th Fleet in the \\"middle sea.\\" In June 1959, the ship entered the Great Lakes for Operation Inland Seas, a celebration honoring the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. In June 1962, the destroyer began a fleet rehabilitation and modernization (FRAM) overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard to update her antisubmarine capabilities. At the conclusion of those alterations, the warship returned to normal operations and completed her decade of deployments and duty in home waters. =Vietnam War= The summer of 1967, however, brought a different, though by no means new, type of assignment—duty in the Far East. On 5 July 1967, she stood out of Norfolk, bound for the Panama Canal. The destroyer transited the canal on 10 July. After stops at San Diego and Pearl Harbor, she arrived in Yokosuka on 10 August. She departed Yokosuka on 13 August and, after stops at Okinawa and Subic Bay, arrived in Vietnamese waters on 24 August. Patrolling near the 17th parallel, she provided gunfire support for the III Marine Amphibious Force (MAF) during operations ashore during the Vietnam War. That first line period lasted until 17 September when she got underway for a port visit to Kaohsiung, Taiwan. She stopped at Kaohsiung from 20 September to 1 October and then moved on to Hong Kong, which port she visited between 2 and 6 October. On 9 October, she resumed naval gunfire support duties in Vietnamese waters, this time off the coast of the II Corps tactical zone. During her second tour on the gunline, Waldrons main battery supported troops of the Army's 1st Air Cavalry Division and of the South Vietnamese 40th Division. On 20 October, she concluded her assignments on the gunline and headed for Yankee Station to join the fast carriers of TF 77. Two days later, she rendezvoused with Task Group (TG) 77.8 for two weeks of planeguard duty with the carriers. She departed the war zone again on 3 November and, after a stop at Okinawa, arrived in Yokosuka on 8 November. A week later, she headed back to Yankee Station with TG 77.8 but parted company with the group on the 18th for a stop at Subic Bay. Waldron returned to Vietnamese waters on 24 November and took up naval gunfire support duties once again off the coast of the II Corps zone. That assignment endured until 10 December when she cleared the war zone for the last time. She made a stop at Subic Bay and then arrived in Yokosuka on 22 December. =1968–1973= Four days later, the destroyer set out for the United States. After stops at Midway and Pearl Harbor, she arrived in San Francisco on 9 January 1968. From there, she headed via San Diego to the Panama Canal which she transited on 25 January. Waldron reentered Norfolk on 30 January. Over the next two years, the destroyer resumed her schedule of Atlantic coast operations alternated with two more deployments to the Mediterranean. On 1 April 1970, Waldron was reassigned to Naval Reserve training under the control of the Commandant, 6th Naval District. Her new home port was Mayport, Florida. She arrived there on 7 May 1970 and began cruises along the Florida coast and in the West Indies training reservists. That duty lasted until the fall of 1973. =Decommissioning= On 30 October 1973, Waldron was decommissioned at Mayport. She was simultaneously transferred, by sale, to the Colombian Navy. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 31 October 1973. ARC Santander (DD-03), in 1974. Colombian Navy In Colombia, she was commissioned as ARC Santander (DD-03). Santander was stricken and scrapped in 1986.http://www.destroyers.org/histories/h-dd-699.htm Honors and awards Waldron earned four battle stars during World War II and one battle star for service during the Vietnam War  References  External links  * navsource.org: USS Waldron * hazegray.org: USS Waldron * usswaldron.org: USS Waldron Alumni Association Category:Allen M.

Originally internal to IBM with no formal IBM support, Team OS/2 successfully converted to a grassroots movement formally supported (but not directed) by IBM - consisting of well over ten thousand OS/2 enthusiasts both within and without IBM. It is one of the earliest examples of both an online viral phenomenon and a cause attracting supporters primarily through online communications. The decline of Team OS/2 largely coincided with IBM's abandonment of OS/2 and the coinciding attacks orchestrated by Microsoft on OS/2, Team OS/2, and IBM's early attempts at online evangelism. HistoryBeginnings= Team OS/2 was a significant factor in the spread and acceptance of OS/2. Formed in February 1992, Team OS/2 began when IBM employee Dave Whittle, recently appointed by IBM to evangelize OS/2 online,Freedman, Beth. \\"IBM Creates Post To Push OS/2 2.0 Into Mass Market,\\" PC Week, Feb. 17, 1992, p. 113 formed an internal IBM discussion group titled TEAMOS2 FORUM on IBM's worldwide network, which at the time, served more individuals than did the more academic Internet. The forum header stated that its purpose was The forum went viral as increasing numbers of IBMers worldwide began to contribute a wide variety of ideas as to how IBM could effectively compete with Microsoft to establish OS/2 as the industry standard desktop operating system. Within a short time, thousands of IBM employees had added the words TEAMOS2 to their internet phone directory listing, which enabled anyone within IBM to find like-minded OS/2 enthusiasts within the company and work together to overcome the challenges posed by IBM's size, insularity, and top-down marketing style. TEAMOS2 FORUM quickly caught the attention of some IBM executives, including Lee Reiswig and Lucy Baney, who after initial scepticism, offered moral and financial support for Whittle's grass roots and online marketing efforts. IBM's official program for generating word-of-mouth enthusiasm was called the \\"OS/2 Ambassador Program\\", where OS/2 enthusiasts company-wide could win Gold, Silver, and Bronze Ambassador pins and corporate recognition with various levels of structured achievement. Both the OS/2 Ambassador Program and Team OS/2 were effective in evangelizing OS/2 within IBM, but only Team OS/2 was effective in generating support for the promotion of OS/2 outside of IBM.Scheier, Robert L. \\"True Believers\\" PCWeek, February 7, 1994. =Externalization= Whittle began to extend the Team OS/2 effort outside of IBM with various posts on CompuServe, Prodigy, bulletin boards, newsgroups, and other venues. He also made a proposal to IBM executives, which they eventually implemented when IBM Personal Software Products moved to Austin, Texas, that they form a \\"Grass Roots Marketing Department\\". Team OS/2 went external that spring, when the first Team OS/2 Party was held in Chicago. The IBM Marketing Office in Chicago created a huge banner visible from the streets. Microsoft reacted when Steve Ballmer roamed the floor with an application on diskette that had been specially programmed to crash OS/2;Dvorak, John C. \\"Microsoft Should Apologize\\" PC Magazine, October 20, 1998, p. 87 and OS/2 enthusiasts gathered for an evening of excitement at the first Team OS/2 party. Tickets were limited to those who had requested them on one of the online discussion groups. Attendees were asked to nominate their favorite \\"Teamer\\" for the \\"Team OS/2 Hall of Fame\\", and those whose names were drawn came forward to tell the story of their nominee - what sacrifice they had made to promote OS/2 and why they were deserving of recognition. Prizes included limousine rides that evening. At the end, all attendees received the first TEAM OS/2 T-shirt, which includes the first Team OS/2 logo on the front and the distinctive IBM blue-stripe logo on the back - except with lower-case letters: \\"ibm/2\\" to represent the new IBM. Even the lead singer in the band Chicago that had provided music for the event asked if they could have a T-shirt for each member of the band. One IBM executive in attendance said it was the first IBM event that had given him goosebumps. After that, word about the Team OS/2 phenomenon spread even more quickly, both within IBM and without. OS/2 enthusiasts spread the word to computer user groups across the United States, then eventually worldwide, independently of IBM marketing efforts. Whittle established multiple localized forums within IBM, such as TEAMNY, TEAMDC, TEAMFL, TEAMTX, and TEAMCA, which attracted new supporters and enabled enthusiastic followers to share ideas and success stories, plan events, and creatively apply what they were learning from one another. The \\"Teamer Invasion\\" of COMDEX in the Fall of 1993 was perhaps the high water mark for Team OS/2. COMDEX was, at that time, the most important computer and electronics trade show, held in Las Vegas. Wearing the salmon-colored shirts which were to become associated with Team OS/2, the group's members, led by Doug Azzarito, Keith Wood, Mike Kogan, IBM User Group Manager Gene Barlow, and others wandered the convention floors, promoting OS/2 and providing demo discs to vendors and offering to install the distributed version of OS/2 on display computers. Many Team OS/2 volunteers had traveled to the convention on their own, including some from overseas; so their independence and grass-roots enthusiasm attracted significant attention in the media and amongst exhibitors. What little funding IBM provided went to provide the shirts, \\"trinkets and trash\\", and an onsite headquarters for Teamers to coordinate their efforts and collect items to give to vendors. IBM had established the Grass Roots Marketing department proposed earlier, and had even tapped Vicci Conway and Janet Gobeille to provide support and guidance for Team OS/2 with Whittle voluntarily stepping aside from his previous day-to-day focus on supporting and monitoring Team OS/2 activities. Janet was nicknamed \\"Team Godmother\\", but everyone in IBM, especially Whittle, was wary of trying to direct volunteers or make Team OS/2 too structured or formal, in order to avoid \\"breaking something that works\\". According to the Team OS/2 Frequently Asked Questions document, Team OS/2 at one point had a presence (sponsoring members willing to publish their e-mail addresses as points of contact) in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, the Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom; as well as online on America Online, CompuServe, Delphi, FidoNet, Genie, the Internet/Usenet/mail servers, Prodigy, and WWIVNet. = Analysis = In an article analyzing Team OS/2 and its meaning and context, Robert L. Scheier listed several of the factors the led to the success of the group. These included the creation of a strong group identity with a powerful name, corporate support without corporate direction, the ability of volunteer members to do things that companies couldn't do, keeping it \\"loose\\" and relatively unstructured, providing lots of smaller material rewards without compensation, and listening to team members as if they were the \\"eyes and ears of the public.\\" However, Team OS/2's very lack of structure left it vulnerable. Various journalists have documented a \\"dirty tricks\\" campaign by Microsoft.Stevens, Elizabeth Lesly. \\"Making Bill\\" Brill's Content, September 1998, p. 109 Online, numerous individuals (nicknamed \\"Microsoft Munchkins\\" by John C. Dvorak) used pseudonyms to attack OS/2 and manipulate online discussions. Whittle was the target of a widespread online character assassination campaign. Some journalists who were less than enthusiastic about OS/2 received death threats and other nasty emails from numerous sources, identified in taglines as \\"Team OS/2\\" without a name. Whether this attack pattern was part of Microsoft's efforts or from Team OS/2, the identity was never proven. Ultimately, at least some of Microsoft's efforts were exposed on Will Zachmann's Canopus forum on CompuServe, where the owner of one particular account, ostensibly belonging to \\"Steve Barkto\\", (who had been attacking OS/2, David Barnes, Whittle, and other OS/2 fans) was discovered to be funded by the credit card of Rick Segal, a high-level Microsoft employee and evangelist, who had also been active in the forums. James Fallows, a nationally renowned journalist, weighed in to state that the stylistic fingerprint found in the Barkto posts were almost certainly a match with the stylistic fingerprints in the Microsoft evangelist's postings. Will Zachmann sent an open letter to Steve Ballmer, futilely demanding a public investigation into the business practices of the publicly traded Microsoft. =Decline= At the height of the marketing effort, Team OS/2 consisted of more than ten thousand known members, and countless undocumented members. IBM acknowledged publicly that without Team OS/2, there might not have been a fourth generation (\\"Warp 4\\") of the operating system. However, the IBM Marketing Director over the Grass Roots Marketing Department made the decision to meet his headcount cut targets by eliminating the entire department - one week before the 1995 Fall Comdex. Microsoft executives were said to be positively gleeful and Team OS/2 members worldwide were said to be incredulous.Petreley, Nicholas. \\"Down to the Wire,\\" InfoWorld, November 27, 1995, p. 137. Within months, Whittle and Barlow had left IBM, Conway and Gobeille were reassigned within IBM, and Teamers were crushed by IBM's announcement that the marketing of individual desktop versions would come to a close. Most Team members eventually migrated away from OS/2 to Linux, which offered the power and stability which they had come to expect from OS/2, and where much of what was learned with Team OS/2 inspired at least some in the Linux and Open Source movements. Legacy Microsoft attempted to fabricate \\"Team NT\\" for COMDEX Fall 1995, but this was widely ridiculed as a blatant attempt at impersonation. \\"Team NT\\" members were Microsoft employees, and called \\"Team Nice Try\\" by industry pundits such as Spencer F. Katt (a pen name with various contributors, such as Paul Connolly), in PCWeek Magazine. When Microsoft was readying the first version of Windows NT (designated \\"Version 3.1\\") in 1993, a Texas computer user group (HAL-PC) invited IBM and Microsoft to a public \\"shootout\\" between the two operating systems. Videotape of the two demonstrations was later distributed by IBM and Team OS/2 members. Compared to the dynamic presentation given by David Barnes as he put OS/2 through its paces, the Microsoft presenter and NT showed so poorly that Microsoft demanded that all portions of the NT presentation be cut out of the videotapes which IBM was distributing of the event. This resulted in issuance of an edited version of the tape, but hundreds of original (complete) copies had already been released. The uncut version of the \\"OS/2 - NT Shootout\\" tape have been dubbed the \\"OS/2 - NT Shootdown\\" or \\"The Shootdown of Flight 31\\". The tape has been used to train professional software and hardware presenters who might face user groups.

Its sensory attributes are similar to Beaujolais Nouveau but, unlike its French counterpart, the St. George ages well for about five years. * Kotsifali is a variety mainly grown on Crete. It is blended with Mandilaria or Syrah to enhance its color. * Limnio, or Kalambaki, is an important red grape variety that is indigenous to the Aegean island of Lemnos and has been used in red wine production for more than 2000 years. As a varietal wine, Limnio is full-bodied, high in alcohol and very herbaceous, with a distinctive taste of bay leaves. * Mandilaria, also known as amorgiano, is mainly cultivated on the islands of Rhodes and Crete. Wine from this grape is often very tannic and frequently blended with other grapes to soften the mouthfeel. * Mavrodaphne, or \\"black laurel\\", is a variety that grows in the Peloponnese and the Ionian Islands. It is blended with the Black Corinth currant grape to produce a prized fortified dessert wine made in the Solera style. * MavroudiMavroudi is one of the oldest Greek grape varieties and supposedly the one on which Odysseus got Polyphemus drunk.

It is also grown in central Greece and Peloponnese, where it is often blended with other Greek wines, and Cyprus, where it is known as \\"Lefkas\\". * Xinomavro (\\"sour black\\") is the predominant grape variety in Macedonia, centered on the town of Naousa. This variety has great aging potential with a palate reminiscent of tomatoes and olives, and a rich tannic character. It is often compared to Nebbiolo. Assyrtiko grapes White wine * Assyrtiko is a multi-purpose variety which maintains its acidity as it ripens. It is similar in character to Riesling, and is mostly island-based, being a native variety of the island of Santorini, whose old vines have been resistant to Phylloxera. * Athiri is a lower acid variety and one of the most ancient. Originally from Santorini, it is now planted in Macedonia, Attica, and Rhodes. * Debina is a white Greek wine grape primarily in the Zitsa region of Epirus. The grape's high acidity lends itself to sparkling wine production. * Lagorthi is a variety mainly cultivated on high slopes (850 meters) in the Peloponnese. The grape produces a very malic and fruity wine. * Malagousia is a grape growing mainly in Macedonia, with a special aroma leading to elegant full bodied wines, with medium-plus acidity and exciting perfumed aromas. * Moschofilero is a Blanc de gris variety from the AOC region of Mantineia, in Arcadia in the Peloponnese. Its wines offer a crisp and floral character in both still and sparkling styles. * Robola is most grown in the mountainous vineyards of the Ionian Island of Cephalonia. It has a smokey mineral and lemony character, excellently complementing seafood. * Roditis (the \\"pink\\" or \\"rose\\" grape) is a grape that is very popular in Attica, Macedonia, Thessaly, and the Peloponnese. This variety produces elegant, light white wines with citrus flavors. * Savatiano (the \\"Saturday\\" grape) is the predominant white grape in the region of Attica, where it displays excellent heat resistance and shows a distinct floral and fruity aroma when cold fermentation is practised.Shara Hall, Lisa, \\"Guide to Greek Wine\\", Epikouria Magazine, Spring/Summer 2006 When fermented without cooling, it makes retsina or rustic unresinated wines that complement Mediterranean dishes well.

UsesDairy= The most common application of L. casei is industrial, specifically for dairy production. Lactobacillus casei is typically the dominant species of nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (i.e. contaminant bacteria) present in ripening cheddar cheese, and, recently, the complete genome sequence of L. casei ATCC 334 has become available. L. casei is also the dominant species in naturally fermented Sicilian green olives. =Medical= A commercial beverage containing L. casei strain Shirota has been shown to inhibit the in vivo growth of Helicobacter pylori, but when the same beverage was consumed by humans in a small trial, H. pylori colonization decreased only slightly, and the trend was not statistically significant. Some L. casei strains are considered to be probiotic, and may be effective in alleviation of gastrointestinal pathogenic bacterial diseases. According to World Health Organization, those properties have to be demonstrated on each specific strain—including human clinical studies—to be valid. L. casei has been combined with other probiotic strains of bacteria in randomized trials studying its effects in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and Clostridium difficile infections (CDI), and patients in the trials who were not given the placebo had significantly lower rates of AAD or CDI (depending on the trial) with no adverse effects reported. Additionally, trials have shown significantly shorter recovery times in children suffering from acute diarrhea (primarily caused by rotavirus) when given different L. casei treatments when compared to placebo. Studies suggest that Lactobacillus is a safe and effective treatment for acute and infectious diarrhea. In the preparation of food, L. casei bacteria can be used in the natural fermentation of beans to lower levels of the compounds causing flatulence upon digestion. =Commercial probiotic= Among the best-documented, probiotic L.casei, L. casei DN-114001, and L. casei Shirota have been extensively studied and are widely available as functional foods (see Actimel, Yakult). Another commercially available form of L. casei can be found in Danactive made by Dannon. They registered trademarked L. casei as L. casei Immunita. =Others= In the past few years, many studies have been conducted in the decolorization of azo dyes by lactic acid bacteria such as L. casei TISTR 1500, L. paracasei, Oenococcus oeni, etc. With the azoreductase activity, mono- and diazo bonds are degraded completely, and generate other aromatic compounds as intermediates.

It is host to over 190 stores, including Canadian Tire, Winners and Staples. History The former Target store, opened in 2013 and closed in 2015 The food court In 1961, Elder Mines & Development Ltd. and Peel Village Developments created Shoppers World Danforth. Targeted completion date was March 1962.Elder Mines Schedules Eaton Store The two developers merged into a new company, Peel-Elder Limited, and began development of Shopper's World Brampton on a farmer's field that had been purchased by Charles F. Watson of Peel-Elder Ltd. Peel-Elder Ltd. was also the developer of the Brampton's Peel Village community. In 1961, planned tenants were Loblaws, Zellers, Yolles, Bata Shoe, a Maher shoe store, Lady Ellis dress shop, Bi-Rite Drugs, Tip Top Tailors and banks. In all, it planned 55 stores, plus a department store, bowling alleys and a movie theatre.To Start Mall In Peel Village A 1963 advertorial for Peel Village describes the mall with 57 shops. =Opening and early years= It opened in 1969 as Brampton's first indoor mall. Major tenants at the time were Kmart, Dominion and Canada Safeway, with a total of 25 stores. The movie theatre closed around 1985. It was gutted, and re-opened as a Jumbo Video. The projection booth served as the manager's office. The Canada Safeway store was the first in eastern Canada. Its opening was targeted by 10 picketers inspired by California's Delano grape strike; the store contacted mall management, who called in the Brampton Police. On the second return of police to the mall, protesters were ordered off the property. James Peters, president of United Auto Workers Local 1285 (American Motors) told the other pickets to leave, but stayed by himself. He was arrested, the first arrest since the demonstrations spread to Canada in 1967. The Dominion store did not carry California grapes. In 1971, Simpsons Ltd. decided to build a location of its department store at the mall, at a cost in excess of $2 million. The first of six scheduled locations, it was to open in August 1972.Shoppers world brampton The 92,000 square foot Brampton site was designed for higher sales, with higher cabinets and 85% selling space, compared to the chain's usual 70% usage. Simpsons' policy was to hold equity interest in its landlords, resulting in it purchasing $5 million of Peel-Elder stock, simultaneous to Hambros Corp. of Canada doing the same; each held roughly 15% of the corporation. The funds were earmarked for expansion of the Brampton and Danforth malls, build high rises in Peel Village, and Preston's Peel Valley Highlands. Simultaneous to the Simpson's announcement, Peel-Elder Ltd. promised to expand the mall and their Peel Village development. In addition to high rise apartments and town houses, the developer intended to build a \\"motel-hotel convention centre and an office building\\", on purchased for expansion purposes, back in 1959.Microsystems plans to boost production After Shoppers World's expansion plans were criticized by the community planning branch of the Department of Municipal Affairs, the office of Premier of Ontario Bill Davis (also the MP for Peel North, which included the mall) was approached by the Town of Brampton, to \\"see if a revision to a by-law could be made\\". After the Ontario Municipal Board approved the change, critics charged that Davis had interfered with planning processes. He insisted that \\"no influence was brought to bear whatsoever\\" by his office. The 1972 expansion increased the mall to 118 stores and 600,000 square feet, from its previous 25 store, 350,000 square foot maximum. By the opening day, Charles Elder envisioned 140 stores, 1 million square feet of retail, and an office building. James Kay, chairman of Fairweather/Tip Top Tailors/BiWay ownership corporation Dylex Limited, entered agreements with one British and one Canadian company to purchase two separate Canadian firms, and merge them into one private investment firm. One of the two firms to be merged was Peel Elder. The resultant firm was known as Kesmark Development Limited; nevertheless, it appears the Peel Elder name was continued until at least 1979. Redevelopment began in late 1979, and in 1982, business was said to have increased by 25% in past year. = \\"Phase Two\\" renovations, 1980s = When Dominion and Simpsons decided to build larger, more modern facilities in the mall, owners Kesmark Ltd. renovated the area they had occupied as \\"Phase Two\\" of the mall. The multimillion-dollar project, which featured 30 new stores, brought the mall's total to 185. Phase Two opened March 10, 1982. A third phase, to begin construction that autumn, was announced immediately. The privately held Kesmark Ltd. sold Kesmark Developments Ltd. to Carena-Bancorp Holdings Inc. in December 1983; the company owned only the Shoppers World Brampton, Danforth, and Albion malls. Kesmark was owned by James Kay, controlling shareholder of Dylex Ltd. The mall's new owners were a holding company owned by Edward and Peter Bronfman. An indoor water park, White Water, was briefly at the mall from 1984 to 1985. https://www.bramptonguardian.com/news- story/8583299-throwback-thursday-brampton-s-shoppers-world-was-first-in- canada-to-build-indoor-water-slide/ In 1997, the mall was owned by Pensionfund Realty Limited, a privately held real estate company owned by a number of Canada's largest institutional investors. As of February 2000, OMERS had owned Shoppers World for roughly five years. It swapped Shoppers World for a 2.5% equity stake in RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust. RioCan was to finance the balance of the $46.5 million price with an $18.5 million mortgage on the site. = Present day = A massive renovation of the shopping complex brought a new wave of customers to come in. Shoppers World Brampton is home to some of Brampton's oldest family-operated businesses. In recent times, Shoppers World Brampton has hosted less traffic. Although still busy, many newer malls have taken the role Shopper's World once played, including Bramalea City Centre and Heartland Town Centre in nearby Mississauga.http://www.brampton.ca/EN/Business/edo/business- knowledge/Economic-Reports-Papers- Statistics/Documents/Annual%20Economic%20Reports/AnnualReport2010.pdf The addition of a Canadian Tire big-box store to the Main Street side of the mall greatly changed the facade of the mall. Many smaller stores were moved or closed to allow for the inclusion of this additional anchor store, which required demolishing the first bus terminal and a mall corridor leading to it, and constructing a new big-box store on the east side of the mall in its place. Canadian Tire had its grand opening week July 12–15th 2001. Staples Business Depot, another big-box format store, also moved into the mall in the locations previously held by Pascals and later, Winners. The Bay closed in May 2007, and the location later became home to a Sears Outlet Store. Price Chopper closed a few months later, and has since been replaced by the multi- ethnic Oceans Fresh Food Market, which opened in July 2008. The former Simpsons/Bay/Sears store at the north-east end of the mall was demolished in October–November 2010, with plans submitted to the City of Brampton to redevelop the north end of the mall. This redevelopment is now completed with most of the stores in this phase accessible only from outside, instead of from within the mall. A Target store opened on March 19, 2013, in the space that had been occupied by Zellers and previously Kmart. This location was one of the first 24 locations to open in Canada. It closed in 2015, when Target withdrew operations in Canada. The space is now the home to a Giant Tiger, GoodLife Fitness, Staples, and a JYSK. In 2019, RioCan, the owners of the mall, unveiled plans to demolish the mall and redevelop it into a mixed-use neighborhood containing 5,000 residences. A proposal was made to Brampton City Council in October 2019; an application went to a public meeting in January 2020. The development, which could take up to thirty years, is expected to be completed by 2040.

It lies in the eastern part of the Sudirman (Nassau) Range of the Maoke Mountains. Behind Puncak Jaya (Carstensz Pyramid) at , it is either the second or third highest mountain on the island of New Guinea and the Australasian continent. As such it appears on some Seven Second Summits lists, although SRTM-data support that Puncak Mandala (Juliana Peak) in the Jayawijaya (Orange) Range is higher with .See for example the lists at peaklist, peakbagger.com, and gunungbagging.comSeveral other summits of Mount Carstensz besides Carstensz Pyramid, like Ngga Pulu (4,862 m) and Carstensz East (4,820 or 4,840 m) are higher than both Mandala and Trikora, but because of their low prominence (200-300 m) and isolation (2.2-2.6 km) these are usually not regarded as separate mountains. Glaciation At the beginning of the 20th century all the highest mountains in New Guinea, including Puncak Jaya (Carstensz Pyramid), Puncak Mandala (Juliana Peak), Ngga Pilimsit (Idenburg) and Puncak Trikora (Wilhelmina Peak), were covered by glaciers. The first expeditions to Maoke Mountains documented a strong recent retreat of all glaciers in the area. The ice cap of Puncak Trikora melted between 1936 and 1962. In 1909 the ice cap still reached as low as . Geology Puncak Trikora is a high point on the central range (Sudirman (Nassau) Range), which was created in the late Miocene Melanesian orogeny, caused by oblique collision between the Australian and Pacific plates and is made of middle Miocene limestones. History Wilhelmina Top (Puncak Trikora), 1913 from south by P. F. Hubrecht On the summit of Wilhelminatop, first ascent 21 February 1913. By Alphons Franssen Herderschee The navigable Noord River made the mountain more accessible than the other snow-covered peaks of Dutch New Guinea and the Dutch organized a series of scientific expeditions in the early 20th century to reach the equatorial eternal snow and climb the mountain. The leader of the first two expeditions was the diplomat and amateur biologist H.A. Lorentz. Each expedition was accompanied by soldiers, porters and dayaks, who were employed for their expertise with boat journeys. In July 1907, the first expedition established Camp Alkmaar near where the Noord River, since 1910 known as the Lorentz River, became unnavigable (), but was unsuccessful in penetrating to the highest mountain range. The Second South New Guinea Expedition also used Camp Alkmaar, from where it left on October 9, 1909. A group of nine, including Lorentz and Jan Willem van Nouhuys, were the first to reach the eternal snow of New Guinea at a height of on November 8, 1909. From the ridge they observed a large lake to the north, which Lorentz named Lake Habbema (), after a member of the expedition. No attempt was made to reach the Wilhelmina summit. The return trip was severe; with a loss of four expedition members, the explorers finally returned to Camp Alkmaar in mid-December. The summit was first reached in 1913 during the Third South New Guinea Expedition, which lasted from September 1912 to April 1913 and followed the same route. It was led by Alphons Franssen Herderschee, an officer of the Royal Dutch East Indies Leger (Koninklijk Nederlandsch-Indisch Leger), and its aim was to research the soils, flora and fauna of the region that lay above 2,300 metres. Other expedition members were the zoologist Gerard Martinus Versteeg, the botanist August Adriaan Pulle, the geologist Paul François Hubrecht, and J.B. Sitanala, an Indonesian GP. Herderschee also took over the role of ethnographer. Including soldiers, porters and dayaks, the baggage train had 241 members. They were divided up into several groups in order to carry out the different tasks in a time-effective way. Herderschee, Hubrecht and Versteeg formed the summit team, which reached the Wilhelminatop on 21 February 1913. The 1920-1922 Central New Guinea Expedition had as goal to reach the mountain from the north coast over a route partially explored in a 1914 military expedition. On February 7, 1920 the first exploration, under leadership of A.J.A. van Overeem started at the mouth of the Mamberamo and followed the Idenburg River. In October, they had climbed across the Doorman Mtns and reached the upper Swart Valley (now Toli Valley). Here they made first contact with the Lani people (a.k.a. the Western Dani people), an agricultural people with whom they stayed for six weeks. Running out of time and food provisions, this expedition returned without climbing Wilhelmina. A follow-up expedition starting in June 1921 and led by J.H.G. Kremer, who was surveyor the previous year, retraced the route, and via the upper Baliem Valley and Lake Habbema reached the summit on 4 December 1921. Among the ascendants was Paul Hubrecht, who had been on the top in 1913 and noticed that the ice cap had retreated considerably since 8 years before.The Papua Insects Foundation.

When Indonesia obtained control of West New Guinea in 1963 it changed the name of the mountain to Puncak Trikora, after the Trikora (Tri Komando Rakyat, \\"People’s Triple Command\\") speech by Sukarno given in December 1961 at a mass meeting in Yogyakarta.

West German stamp commemorating Leonardo's 500th birthday Leonardo da Vinci (April 15, 1452 – May 2, 1519) was an Italian Renaissance painter and polymath who achieved legendary fame and iconic status within his own lifetime. His renown primarily rests upon his brilliant achievements as a painter, the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, being two of the most famous artworks ever created, but also upon his diverse skills as a scientist and inventor. He became so highly valued during his lifetime that the King of France bore him home like a trophy of war, supported him in his old age and, according to legend, cradled his head as he died. Leonardo's portrait was used, within his own lifetime, as the iconic image of Plato in Raphael's School of Athens. His biography was written in superlative terms by Vasari. He has been repeatedly acclaimed the greatest genius to have lived. His painting of the Mona Lisa has been the most imitated artwork of all time and his drawing the Vitruvian Man iconically represents the fusion of Art and Science. Leonardo's biography has appeared in many forms, both scholarly and fictionalized. Every known aspect of his life has been scrutinized and analyzed. His paintings, drawings and notebooks have been studied, reproduced and analyzed for five centuries. The interest in and appreciation of the character of Leonardo and his talents has never waned. Leonardo has appeared in many fictional works, such as novels, television shows, video games and movies, the first such fiction dating from the 16th century. Various characters have been named after him.  Artworks after originals by Leonardo  Copies = Peter Paul Rubens' copy of the lost Battle of Anghiari Leonardo's pupils and followers copied or closely imitated many of his pictures. Several of his important works exist only as copies by his admirers. These include: * His cartoon of The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist copied as an oil painting by Luini * The Battle of Anghiari was copied several times by unknown Florentine artists as well by Peter Paul Rubens. * Leda and the Swan exists only as copies in the Louvre and Villa Borhgese. Other much much-copied works include: * Mona Lisa for which Angela della Chiesa cites 14 examples of which 6 are bare-breasted. These include paintings by Bernardino Luini, Salaì and Joos van Cleve. * John the Baptist for which there exist at least five versions by other hands including Salai. = Parodies of the Mona Lisa= No painting has been more imitated and satirised than the Mona Lisa. Beginning possibly with a naked portrait of Diane de Poitiers by Clouet, the pose and expression have been freely adapted to many female portraits. The avant-garde art world has made note of the undeniable fact of the Mona Lisa's popularity. Because of the painting's overwhelming stature, Dadaists and Surrealists often produce modifications and caricatures. Already in 1883, Le rire, an image of a Mona Lisa smoking a pipe, by Sapeck (Eugène Bataille), was shown at the \\"Incoherents\\" show in Paris. In 1919, Marcel Duchamp, one of the most influential modern artists, created L.H.O.O.Q., a Mona Lisa parody made by adorning a cheap reproduction with a moustache and a goatee, as well as adding the rude inscription, when read out loud in French sounds like \\"Elle a chaud au cul\\" literally translated: \\"she has a hot ass\\". This is a manner of implying the woman in the painting is in a state of sexual excitement and availability. This was intended as a Freudian joke, referring to Leonardo's alleged homosexuality. According to Rhonda R. Shearer, the apparent reproduction is in fact a copy partly modelled on Duchamp's own face. Salvador Dalí, famous for his surrealist work, painted Self portrait as Mona Lisa in 1954. In 1963 following the painting's visit to the United States, Andy Warhol created serigraph prints of multiple Mona Lisas called Thirty are Better than One, like his works of Marilyn Monroe (Twenty- five Coloured Marilyns, 1962), Elvis Presley (1964) and Campbell's soup (1961–1962). =Replicas of lost works= \\"Il Gran Cavallo\\". This monumental bronze horse, 7 metres (24 feet) high, is a conjectural re-creation of a clay horse that was created in Milan by Leonardo da Vinci for the Ludovico Sforza and was intended to be cast in bronze. Leonardo never finished the project because of war with France, and the clay horse was ruined. This representation was based on a number of Leonardo's preparatory drawings. It was created in 1999 in New York and given to the city of Milan. =Presentation of existing works= The Last Supper is to be the subject of an animation by British film- maker Peter Greenaway, who plans to project interpretative images onto its surface to enliven the scene in which the apostles all question Jesus' statement that one of them will betray him.  Representations of Leonardo in art The Death of Leonardo= Ménageot's The Death of Leonardo da Vinci, 1781 The Death of Leonardo da Vinci by Ingres, 1818 The story of Leonardo dying in the arms of the French king Francis I, although apocryphal,King Francis cannot have been present because the day after Leonardo's death, a royal edict was issued by the King at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, a two-day journey distant from Clos Luce. appealed to the self-image of later French kings and to French history painters of the 18th and 19th centuries. Apparently on commission from Louis XVI,According to François-Charles Joullain fils, Réflexions sur la peinture et la gravure 1786:2. Ménageot painted The Death of Leonardo da Vinci in the arms of Francis I in 1781, setting it in a background of classical statuary. This painting, which was the triumph of the Salon of 1781, included a portrayal of the Borghese Gladiator (Ménageot probably having seen it at the Villa Borghese during his stay at the French Academy in Rome from 1769 to 1774), although this was an anachronism since Leonardo died in 1519, about ninety years before the statue was discovered. In 1818 The Death of Leonardo da Vinci by the French painter, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, depicts the scene of Leonardo's death shown taking place in the home Clos Lucé, which was provided for him at Amboise by King Francis I. The King is shown supporting Leonardo's head as he dies, as described by Vasari, watched by the Dauphin who is comforted by a cardinal. A distraught young man may represent Leonardo's pupil Melzi. The treatment of this subject by Ingres is indicative of Leonardo's iconic status and also specifically that he was of particular significance to the school of French Classicism. A number of his paintings had passed into the Royal collection and certain elements of them were much imitated. Leonardo's manner of soft shading known as sfumato was particularly adapted by Ingres, Jacques-Louis David and their followers. An influential painting was Leda and the swan, now regarded as by a pupil of Leonardo but then generally accepted as the master's work. =Statues= * A monument to Leonardo was erected in 1872 in Piazza del Scala, Milan. It comprises five marble statues by Pietro Magni, of Leonardo and his pupils Cesare da Sesto, Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio, Marco d'Oggiono and “Andrea Salaino”, and four reliefs depicting scenes in Leonardo's life. * A statue of Leonardo by the Bulgarian sculptor Assen Peikov stands outside Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport (Rome).

While there was no way of knowing whether the student went to the past or the future, Dr. Twitchell hints that he believes it was the past due to the student's name—Leonard Vincent. * In the novel Saturn's Apprentice by M.A. Lang, an alchemical experiment gone wrong causes Leonardo to be lost in the present day, while back in Renaissance Florence his friend Tomasso Masini desperately tries to save him. * Leonardo da Vinci is a significant character in the novels Assassin's Creed: Renaissance and Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood (novel), books based on the video game series Assassin's Creed. Leonardo is portrayed as a close friend of the protagonist, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a Florentine nobleman's son who joined the Assassin Brotherhood after the murder of his father and brothers by the ruling families of Italy, each part of the once thought disbanded Knight's Templar. Leonardo helps the assassin decipher encrypted codex pages left behind by legendary master assassin, Altair (the protagonist of the original Assassin's Creed game). Leonardo's flying machine is successfully built and helps Ezio travel across Venice in order to assassinate one of his targets. Leonardo makes a brief appearance in Assassin's Creed: Revelations novel. Ezio and his close friend and fellow Assassin, Niccolò Machiavelli visit him during the week that he died, present at his side while he passes away. Machiavelli recalls a rumour that King Francis cradled his head in his arms as he died, to which Ezio remarked: \\"Some people – even Kings – will do anything for publicity\\".  The Da Vinci Code  This work of fiction has been the centre of controversy over the accuracy of its depictions of Christianity and of Leonardo. A bestselling 2003 novel by Dan Brown, adapted and released as a major motion picture in 2006, The Da Vinci Code revolves around a conspiracy based on elements of Leonardo's Last Supper and other works. A preface to the novel claims that depictions of artworks, secret societies and rites described within the novel are factual. For this reason much of the content of the novel has been widely accepted by readers as authoritative. Because the theme involves a conspiracy within the Church over the life of Jesus and the suggestion that the Church has hidden the facts of his marriage, there has been a strong reaction against the novel and much material published examining and refuting its claims. Within the novel it is claimed that from 1510–1519, Leonardo was the Grand Master of a secret society, the Priory of Sion. In reality this society existed only as a 20th-century hoax, but author Dan Brown used as a source the 1982 pseudohistory book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. The writers of this book had based their research on forged medieval documents that had been created as part of the Priory of Sion fraud. The mix of fact and fiction in the documents made it difficult to discount immediately as a forgery. For example, it was claimed that the Grand Master prior to Leonardo was Botticelli, who had indeed had an association with Leonardo, as they were both students at the Florence workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio. The Priory of Sion story and the veracity of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail was eventually debunked, and many of those involved publicly recanted, although Dan Brown continued to assert that the facts as presented were true. In portraying the Priory of Sion as \\"fact\\" The Da Vinci Code expanded on the claims in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail: * That there were additional secrets hidden in Leonardo's paintings, such as an \\"M\\" letter in the painting of The Last Supper, indicating the presence of Mary Magdalene and that the figure to the left of Jesus traditionally said to represent John the Evangelist actually represents Mary Magdalene. * That the Mona Lisa was actually a self-portrait. * That among the differences in the two versions of the painting of the Virgin of the Rocks which hang in the Louvre and London's National Gallery, is the fact that in the Louvre painting the baby to the left of the picture depicts Jesus, and to the right John the Baptist, rather than the accepted view, which is the other way round. * That Leonardo invented a cryptex for carrying secret messages. The book also used a variation of Leonardo's backwards handwriting to hide a secret message on the American bookjacket. Among the many criticisms of Brown's writing is that he uses the name da Vinci (meaning \\"from Vinci\\") in the manner that surnames are commonly used nowadays. Leonardo would never have been referred to simply as \\"da Vinci\\" in his lifetime. Such designations were appended to common baptismal names in order to identify individuals. = Film = Films which are about the life of Leonardo or in which he appears as a character: * Leonardo Da Vinci (1919), silent film *The Life of Leonardo da Vinci (1971) starring Philippe Leroy as Leonardo da Vinci *Nothing Left to Do But Cry (1984) starring Roberto Benigni and Massimo Troisi *Quest of the Delta Knights (1993) depicting a fictional version of the young Leonardo * Leonardo Da Vinci (1996) – Animated movie * Ever After (1998) starring Drew Barrymore and Patrick Godfrey as Leonardo da Vinci * Christie Malry's Own Double-Entry (2000) starring Mattia Sbragia as Leonardo da Vinci * The Virgins of Sherwood Forest (2000) and The Exotic Time Machine II (2000) - two softcore films by Surrender Cinema filmed in close succession.

It is within the Town of Catharine, about north of Odessa. The lake is also referred to locally as Little Lake. Name origin The name \\"Cayuta\\" is of Native American origin, and is shared with a nearby stream, town, and hamlet. The name may have been derived from the word geihate (\\"a river\\"), or it may be a corrupted form of kanyatiye (\\"a lake\\"). Additional possibilities for the name's origin include keunton (\\"prickly ash\\") or an abbreviated form of kayahtane (\\"mosquito\\"). The lake was also known to Native Americans as Ganiatarenge (\\"at the lake\\"). By legend the lake is named after a Seneca princess, who was kidnapped by another tribe, causing her mother's tears to form the lake. An older spelling, still sometimes used, is \\"Kayutah\\". Description Cayuta Lake is an approximately lake with a surface area of about . It reaches a maximum depth of and has an average depth of . The lake is linked to the Susquehanna River by Cayuta Creek, which flows out the south end of the lake. A major feeder stream for Cayuta Lake is Cayuta Lake Inlet, which enters the lake through a marsh area on the north end. Much of this northern shore of the lake is within the Allen Preserve. Cayuta Lake contains a heavy growth of submerged aquatic vegetation along most all shoreline areas, but especially in the shallow water near the south end of the lake. Fish species include walleye, chain pickerel, largemouth bass, yellow perch, bluegill, pumpkinseed, black crappie, rock bass, brown bullhead, chubsucker, golden shiner, white sucker, common carp. Fishing Cayuta Lake provides warmwater fishing opportunities. Largemouth bass and chain pickerel are the primary predators found in the lake. A recent angler survey revealed largemouth bass and larger are occasionally caught. In addition to bass and pickerel, walleye populations provide added diversity to angler catches. Bluegills, yellow perch, and black crappie are plentiful and dominate the panfish catch. In addition to the open water fishery, ice fishing opportunities exist within Cayuta Lake with anglers targeting pickerel and panfish species. In the past, a small, naturally occurring walleye population has periodically been supplemented with hatchery-reared fish resulting in a sizeable walleye fishery. However, an abundant alewife population has negatively impacted both walleye recruitment and angler success for walleye with only a few anglers catching an occasional large walleye. More recently, a research project looking at controlling alewife populations from a predator level resulted in the stocking of over 250,000 walleye fingerlings over a 5-year period ending in 2006. Although the desired results have not yet been achieved, these fish have reached the minimum size limit and are quite abundant, but still difficult to catch. =Access= Much of the shoreline is private property, however a state-owned public boat launch is located on the north end of Cayuta Lake on Loch Heid Road off of Cayutaville Road. There is a concrete ramp, seasonal dock, and parking for 15 cars and trailers.

It is best known for the tamboradas (drumming processions) held during the Holy Week. Tamboradas are a tradition in the area spanning the Murcian towns of Mula and Moratalla and the towns of Hellín and Baena in the provinces of Albacete and Córdoba, respectively. Geography The neighborhoods of Mula include Fuente Librilla, Yechar, Los Baños De Mula, Puebla De Mula y Casas Nuevas. The municipality of Mula has the following neighboring municipalities: *Calasparra, Cieza and Ricote to the North *Ricote, Campos del Río, Albudeite, Alcantarilla and Murcia to the East *Librilla, Alhama de Murcia and Totana to the South *Bullas, Cehegín and Lorca to the West *Pliego is completely surrounded by Mula. Part of Sierra Espuña mountain range occupies part of the municipality. Another remarkable geographical element is Mula river and a stretch of it traverses Mula. There are also some arroyos (cheeks) or ramblas.  History  There is evidence of human occupancy from the Prehistory, specifically the Neolithic. During the Calcolithic this municipality was also occupied by people of the Argaric civilization. The people that lived in the territory during the Bronze Age have left a remarkable site: El Cigarralejo, which was a Iberian settlement and included a necropolis and a shrine. During the Roman Hispania era there was also people presence in the current municipality. Remains of that fact are some archaeological sites. One of them is a former villa named Villaricos. There were people in a former town that is currently an archaeological site which name is Cerro de la Almagra. In Muslim Iberian Peninsula era there were people living in Mula and they established a town in the same place as the current town. In the year 1243 the muslim king Ibn-Hud started to bestow vassalage to the kingdom of Castile as a result of the Treaty of Alcaraz. However, Mula and other towns (Lorca and Cartagena) refused to accept that status. The following year, there was a siege in the square of Mula. As a result, the town surrendered owing to the starvation. Muslim people of the area were taken their properties and were forced to move to Puerta de Mula, a hamlet of the municipality where. As Reconquista ended and all the Iberian Peninsula was again under Christian rule, a expulsion of people who had not convert to Christianism was ordered. As a consequence, there were a lack and a need of people presence in several areas of the peninsula. Almost 100 people moved to Mula from Christian kingdoms in Iberian Peninsula. During the 17th century Mula was scenery of epidemics and starvation. The plague disease of 1648 took half of the population life. In the early 19th century people experienced a poverty situation. The lack of cleaness, the lack of harvests, the war and two strong epidemics caused population losses. In Peninsular War context, French people invaded and plundered Mula in October 1812. In the early 20th century, two urban structures and services were set: the railroad and a reservoir. In that century vines and olive trees stopped being growed as traditionally and citrics began to be raised. That fact led to a need of more water and to the reservoir construction. A population rise occurred until the 1960s and the number of inhabitants consisted of 15,000 in that year. As population was increasing the town was expanding to the south. After the increase in population, it became stabilized because there are few wealth sources: agriculture and water supplies. Therefore, the number of inhabitants depends of the level of this economy activity and the level of that resource. Economy The economy of Mula rests on dryland farming and ranching. Manufacturing in Mula is concentrated in the food and beverage sectors. The \\"El Arreaque\\" industrial park, to the east of the town center, was inaugurated in 2004. Demographic Change of Mula (in green) compared to the entire district. Main sightsReligious buildings= Saint Michael's church (la Parroquia de San Miguel) is located in Mula's City Hall Square (La Plaza del ayuntamiento de Mula). With its two towers, including a clock tower, it forms a large monumental complex that often serves as the logo of the municipality. This church suffered near total destruction during the Spanish Civil War; only the entranceway was saved. The rest of the decorative paintings and sculptures were destroyed. It is known that the canopy of the old altar and the wall paintings were done in the Baroque style. It was quite tall for its era. The church contains two chapels: to the right, the Chapel of Marquesa (marchioness) Vélez, and to the left, the Chapel of San Felipe. The latter chapel contains relics of the saint brought from Sicily by Marquesa Vélez in 1648. This church has an art museum made possible by a donation from Doña Pilar de la Canal, widow of Don Pedro Luis Blaya, in 1940. It collection spans from the 16th to the 20th centuries. =Castle of the Vélez Family= The castle was mentioned by Al-Idrisi, a 12th-century travelerEmilio Molina, \\"Aproximación al estudio de Mula islámica\\" and by King Alfonso X. In the 15th century it had a massive wall to the north.Don Juan González Castaño There was one wall to protect the cisterns of the city and another wall to watch over the city's two parishes recently converted to Christianity; these walls remain. The architecture of the castle is Renaissance in its defensive character and simple forms, situated over a crag of rock. Of the two entrances, one of them accedes better to the high part of the wall and the towers of the old Muslim fortress in addition to a drawbridge. It contains four differentiating elements: the torre del homenaje, a central nave with a barrel vault, a structure semidetached from the nave and a cistern. The cistern is an indication of Muslim influence because it is an essential element of a mosque. = Museums = *\\"El Cigarralejo\\". In this museum are exhibited the remains, ceramics, and utensils of the Iberian epoch, which have been taken out from the ruins of a town, necropolis, and sanctuary of that time. *Casa Pintada (many-colored house): The museum is located in a Renaissance palace, and contains a collection of many of the works of Cristobal Gabarrón. *The \\"Castle of Alcalá\\" or castle of La Puebla, situated on a hill near the La Puebla district. The castle is Muslim and is characterized by a gateway and the cisterns that supplied the water to the city.  Culture National contest of rapid painting= This is called each year on the second Sunday of November, coinciding with the Craft Bazaar \\"Las 4 Plazas\\". On the first occasion (November 11, 2007) 114 painters, coming from all over Spain, met on a sunny, spring-like day. It was in every way a success that did not distance the residents and visitors, given the beauty and variety of places that Mula possesses. It was one more occasion to visit this historic and welcoming Murcian city. =Spanish Film Week= Since 1988 the \\"Segundo de Chomón Cinema Club\\" has been coming together as a denominational competition of the Spanish Film Week, and since 1993 the National Contest of Film Shorts. Both events are now obligatory appointments of the aficionados of the seventh art, each year in spring. It's an occasion to benefit from the actors, directors, and invitations to enjoy the historic resources, cultural inheritance, excellent temperature, and partake of the rich gastronomy of the region.Documento sin título Sports In sports, Mula counts some swimming pools, situated around the football field. Mula has two municipal football fields (one of grass and the other waits to become artificial). There is a football pavilion, hall, \\"Grand Route\\" and a sports center with another pavilion, an outdoor pool, and tennis and basketball courts. FestivalsThe Night of the Drums= The origin of the playing of the drum in Mula is difficult to narrow down, but it seems to have taken place during the 14th century, as a form of protest. It is not presently clear that the first mention written that we have of the playing of the drum through the streets of Mula go back to the municipal ordinances of 1859, where it is written that only those persons authorized through the Brotherhood of Carmen were allowed to go through the streets with drums, and only in the procession. For this reason it is supposed that already at that time in the Holy Week of that year the people went out to play drums through the streets. It is believed that this tradition of playing drums comes from the beginnings of the fourteenth century. It is possible to think that through the ages in which the playing of the drum in this locality, Holy Week, it could have been thought that it is a form of religious demonstration, but it is not at all the case that the people of Mula begin to play drums in protest at the restrictions and prohibitions imposed by the civil and catholic authorities in the locality. On the night between the Holy Tuesday and the Holy Wednesday, in the plaza of the town hall, thousands of people dressed up in black tunics with huge drums congregate in and around the plaza outside the town hall. A few minutes before the clock strikes 12, the street lights in the plaza are dimmed and all goes silent. Suddenly all the drummers raise their hands above their heads and create a beat by banging their sticks together. A fanfare of trumpets join in and finalise the end of the introduction. A few seconds then pass and the ground begins to tremble and shake and you can feel the vibrations through your whole body as thousands of drums begin to play at once, the ground begins to tremble... and in this way begins the Night of the Drums of Mula. The drummers don't stop the playing the drums for the whole night. MEan women and children march the streets all night beating upon their drums in a repetitive beat. The drumming continues into the next day and often after that. = The drum = The instrument is fabricated in a homemade form by craftsmen from Mula. The modern drum may have changed over the length of the years, perhaps losing something of the originality, taking many of the elements of the next town of Moratalla. But moving toward perfection in many perceptions. The instruments, whose diameters seldom approached 45 centimeters, had a like complement of drumsticks with fine points, that served to drumroll and beat without great force. Now, the drum that is highly valued is that with large dimensions (55, 60 or 65 centimeters in diameter) and drumsticks with point in form of a \\"club\\" with which one can strike with force on the skin of the drum. The method of manufacture of the drum also has changed. In the past it was not possible to commission a blacksmith for a box and screws. The people used their ingenuity with laths, to constitute the base of the drum. In those cases the skins were tightened using some holes punched in the rings and winding a cord to constrict them. The strings were made with intestines of animals. In the present day, the drums are made with a metallic box, screws to tighten and the strings are guitar cords. = Other celebrations = National Short Film Competition organized since 1993 by the Segundo de Chomón film club. Easter and Semana Santa, along with Tamborada (Night of the Drums), declared of National Tourist Interest. Processions begin on Good Friday from the Church of San Miguel with the Via Crucis, and continue with the procession of Palm Sunday Morning from Santo Domingo church to meet Pedro Leon nude in the Town Hall Square. The parades continue on Holy Wednesday from the Chapel of Carmen, Holy Thursday the procession of Jesus of Nazareth, and late in night the procession of Christ of the Asylum, and the Good Friday procession of the Holy Burial, leaving these three processions from Santo Domingo. On Easter Sunday, the procession of the Risen Christ descends from the Royal Monastery of the Incarnation to the Town Hall Square where 9 processional thrones meet each other. Fiestas de San Isidro on the second Saturday of May, in honor of San Isidro Labrador, patron of the garden and field, basis of the local economy. Procession with the saint from the church of Santo Domingo in the morning, accompanied by choirs and dance groups and locals dressed in traditional costumes, to the Town Hall Square where it develops the Market \\"The Four Squares\\". \\"Bando huertano\\" on afternoon with floats towed by agricultural machinery, barracks and buildings that emulate typical of the garden, with distribution of sausages and vegetables. At night, festival and concert in Fair Park, where the parade ends. Fair and Festivals of September, beginning with the Descent of the image of gay Jesus Balate, September 8, from his Sanctuary to the Royal Monastery of the Incarnation, where the 11th is moved to the church of Santo Domingo for the Novena in his Honor. The Fair takes place from 19 to 25. Day 21 is celebrated the Feast of the Child Jesus, commemorating his appearance to the shepherd Fray Pedro de Jesus Botía in 1648, with morning religious services and evening procession through the streets of the city. 22, Pilgrimage to the return of the image to his temple, and cookouts around the sanctuary. On 23, the Feast of Our Lady of Carmen, with masses in the chapel and evening procession. 25, Feast of the Patron Saint Philip Martir, with evening religious service in the church of San Miguel followed by procession.

Jean Le Pautre was an apprentice to a carpenter and builder. In addition to learning mechanical and constructive work, he developed considerable skill with the pencil. His designs, innumerable in quantity and exuberant in content, consisted mainly of ceilings, friezes, chimney-pieces, doorways and mural decorations. He also devised fire-dogs, sideboards, cabinets, console tables, mirrors and other pieces of furniture. Le Pautre was long employed at the Gobelins manufactory. His work is often very flamboyant and elaborate. He frequently used amorini and swags, arabesques and cartouches in his work. His chimney-pieces, in contrast, were often simple and elegant. His engraved plates, nearly 1,500 in number, are almost entirely original and include a portrait of himself. He made many designs for Andre Charles Boulle. He became a member of the academy of Paris in 1677.

The sparks flying outwards are globules of molten iron trailing smoke in their wake. Aluminothermic reactions are exothermic chemical reactions using aluminium as the reducing agent at high temperature. The process is industrially useful for production of alloys of iron. The most prominent example is the thermite reaction between iron oxides and aluminium to produce iron itself: : Fe2O3 \\\\+ 2 Al -> 2 Fe + Al2O3 This specific reaction is however not relevant to the most important application of aluminothermic reactions, the production of ferroalloys. For the production of iron, a cheaper reducing agent, coke, is used instead via the carbothermic reaction. History Aluminothermy started from the experiments of Russian scientist Nikolay Beketov at the University of Kharkiv in Ukraine, who proved that aluminium restored metals from their oxides under high temperatures. The reaction was first used for the carbon-free reduction of metal oxides. The reaction is highly exothermic, but it has a high activation energy since strong interatomic bonds in the solids must be broken first. The oxide was heated with aluminium in a crucible in a furnace. The runaway reaction made it possible to produce only small quantities of material. Hans Goldschmidt improved the aluminothermic process between 1893 and 1898, by igniting the mixture of fine metal oxide and aluminium powder by a starter reaction without heating the mixture externally. The process was patented in 1898 and used extensively in the later years for rail track welding. Applications The aluminothermic reaction is used for the production of several ferroalloys, for example ferroniobium from niobium pentoxide and ferrovanadium from iron, vanadium(V) oxide, and aluminium. The process begins with the reduction of the oxide by the aluminium: :3 V2O5 \\\\+ 10 Al → 5 Al2O3 \\\\+ 6 V Other metals can be produced from their oxides in the same way. Aluminothermic reactions have been used to welding rail tracks on-site, useful for complex installations or local repairs that cannot be done using continuously welded rail. Another common use is the welding of copper cables (wire) for use in direct burial (grounding/earthing) applications. It is still the only type of electrical connection recognized by the IEEE (IEEE, Std 80-2001) as continuous un-spliced cable.

Ford shares a parish with Etal.  History before 1513  Very little is known of the history of the area before the Norman Conquest in the 11th century, but Bronze Age rock carvings in the area suggest that there might have been some settlement at that time. It is thought the shallow crossing of the River Till (a ford) which gave the village its name, was probably a crossing place for monks and nuns travelling between the monasteries at Iona and Lindisfarne during the Anglo-Saxon period. Parsons Tower, Ford Written records for Ford begin after the Norman Conquest in 1066 and the introduction of the manorial system when the manor of Ford was held by the Heron family. A substantial stone castle was built at Ford in 1287, to protect the manor from the constant border warfare waged between the Scots and the English during the medieval period. South-west of the castle are the remains of the Parson's Tower, a medieval pele tower which was once the home of the local parson. In 1513, James IV of Scotland made his base at Ford Castle, prior to the Battle of Flodden, the biggest battle between the two nations. James was killed, along with 9,000 of his men.  History after 1513  After Flodden, peace came to the area and by the 19th century, Ford was a thriving agricultural and forestry community. Ford Castle had been rebuilt in the 1760s and, in 1859, Louisa, Marchioness of Beresford inherited Ford Estate on the death of her husband, the 3rd Marquess (who in turn, had inherited it from his mother, Susanna, Marchioness of Waterford). Lady Louisa Waterford, a gifted amateur watercolorist with an interest in the welfare of the tenants on the estate, rebuilt the village. A new school was built which today is the Lady Waterford Hall, decorated with wall paintings by Lady Waterford (opens daily at 10.30 am). The 12th-century church of St Michael and All Angels was restored. The estate was bought by James Joicey, 1st Baron Joicey in 1907 and it remains in the ownership of the Joicey family today. The castle was used as a convalescent hospital by the Red Cross during the Second World War and is now leased by the Northumberland County Council who use it as an educational camp. The castle is not open to the public except on special open days. Today Much employment in Ford is connected in one way or another with the Ford and Etal Estate. There is a primary school, Hugh Joicey Church of England First School, and a village shop, which doubles as a Post Office. There are also several businesses connected with tourism, such as plant nurseries, a gift shop, a second-hand book dealer and some bed and breakfast establishments.

The screenplay by Horton Foote and Thomas C. Ryan is based on the 1965 novel of the same title by K.B. Gilden, a pseudonym for the married couple Katya and Bert Gilden. It marked Faye Dunaway's film debut. Plot In 1946, bigoted, draft-dodging, gold- digging Henry Warren and his heiress, land-owning wife Julie Ann, are determined to sell their land in rural Georgia to owners of a northern canning plant but the deal rests on selling two adjoining plots as well, one owned by Henry's cousin Rad McDowell and his wife Lou, the other by black farmer Reeve Scott, whose ailing mother Rose had been Julie's wet nurse. Neither farmer is interested in selling his land, and they form a dangerous and controversial black and white partnership to strengthen their legal claim to their land, which infuriates Henry. When Rose suddenly dies, Henry tries to persuade his wife to charge Reeve with illegal ownership of his property, but local black teacher Vivian Thurlow searches the town's records and uncovers proof that Reeve legally registered the deed to his land. Julie, upset with Henry's treatment of their mentally challenged young son, decides to leave him and drops her suit against Reeve. With the help of Ku Klux Klansmen, Henry dynamites the levee above the farms, and Rad's oldest child drowns in the ensuing flood, much to Henry's dismay. Rather than admit defeat, Rad and Reeve decide to rebuild their decimated property with the assistance of their neighbors.

He initially intended to adapt it for a four-and-a-half-hour epic film that would be shown twice-a-day at what would be the highest price scale in the history of American film exhibition, with a top admission of $25 on Friday and Saturday nights. When the book sold a mere 300,000 copies, Preminger decided a less grandiose project might be in order.Hirsch, pp. 410–411 Because he admired his screenplay for the Harper Lee novel To Kill a Mockingbird, Preminger hired Horton Foote to adapt the Gilden book, which the author thought was \\"embarrassing,\\" with \\"no genuine Southern flavor at all.\\" His first instinct was to decline the offer, but he then decided he could do something with it, so Preminger installed him and his family in a house in London, where the director was filming Bunny Lake Is Missing. Foote completed his draft in three months, but Preminger was unhappy with it, feeling it was missing the melodrama and theatricality the story required. He paid Foote his full fee and dismissed him, although he later insisted on giving the writer screen credit, which Foote accepted. (In later years he admitted he never saw the film and never included it on his résumé.) Preminger replaced Foote with Thomas C. Ryan, who worked for him as his chief reader and was familiar with the type of material his employer found appealing.Hirsch, pp. 411–412 Preminger wanted to shoot the entire film in Georgia, and in November and December 1965 he visited the state to scout locations, but a union dispute changed his plans. Because he would be filming during the oppressively hot and humid months of June through August, he planned to shoot at night as much as possible. The New York union, which had jurisdiction over Georgia, demanded crews be paid double for any filming after 4:00pm, an added expense Preminger knew would be prohibitive. Production designer Gene Callahan suggested his home state of Louisiana might be a viable alternative, since the unions there were governed by the more liberal one in Chicago. Baton Rouge and its environs were selected, and Callahan's crew began planting cornfields, erecting shanties, and constructing a dam and reservoir containing 17.5 million gallons of water.Hirsch, p. 414 From the start, Preminger and his cast and crew encountered strong resistance from the locals, who resented having a film featuring a biracial friendship made in their midst and were prejudiced against the film's Black crew members and cast. Tires were slashed, some actors received telephoned death threats, and a burning cross appeared on one of the sets at 3:00 am. The manager of the hotel where everyone was housed, the Bellemont Motor Hotel, advised Preminger mixed bathing would not be permitted in the swimming pools, but grudgingly agreed to designate one \\"interracial\\" when the director threatened to vacate the premises and not pay the bill. At one point a \\"crude bomb\\" was thrown into the desegregated pool, but no one was injured as it happened late at night.Dunaway, Faye, and Sharkey, Betsey, Looking for Gatsby.

It has smooth reddish brown bark at first, later shedding in curling flakes, lance-shaped, sometimes curved adult leaves, club-shaped flower buds covered with a waxy, bluish white bloom, pink stamens with yellow anthers and urn-shaped fruit.fruithabit Description Eucalyptus caesia is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. The bark is smooth reddish brown at first and is shed in curling longitudinal flakes known as \\"minnirichi\\". Young branches are shiny red, covered with a waxy, bluish white bloom. Young plants and coppice regrowth have thick, glossy green, heart-shaped leaves long and wide that have a petiole. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, mostly long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of three on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual flowers on pedicels long. Mature flower buds are oval or pear-shaped, covered with a whitish waxy bloom, long and wide with a conical operculum. Flowering mainly occurs between May and September and the flowers have pink stamens with yellow anthers on the tip. The fruit is a woody bell-shaped or urn-shaped capsule long and wide on a peduncle long. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus caesia was first formally described in 1867 by George Bentham from a collection made by James Drummond in 1847 and the description was published in Flora Australiensis. In 1982, Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper described two subspecies, but the Australian Plant Census accepts these as synonyms: * Eucalyptus caesia subsp. caesia grows to a height of with smaller leaves, buds and fruit than the other subspecies; * Eucalyptus caesia subsp. magna grows to a height of with pendulous branches and larger leaves, buds and fruit. The specific epithet (caesia) is a Latin word meaning \\"bluish grey\\" referring to the waxy cover of the small branches, flower buds and fruit. Distribution and habitat Caesia grows in crevices at the base of granite outcrops in scattered inland areas of the south-west, including in the Avon Wheatbelt and Mallee biogeographic regions. The species is known to be drought tolerant. Ecology Despite persisting as very small populations, this species does not seem to exhibit effects of inbreeding depression. Associated species include Eucalyptus crucis, Eucalyptus loxophleba, Allocasuarina huegeliana and Acacia lasiocalyx. Use in horticulture A form known as 'Silver Princess' is described as a \\"graceful weeping tree\\" that has a regular and weeping form. Propagation is from seed, which germinates readily.

The film features Adolphe Menjou, Arthur Franz, Gerald Mohr and Marie Windsor. The film marks Dmytryk's return to directing after he had first been named to the Hollywood blacklist and had a jail term for contempt of Congress. He chose to testify in April 1951, and named fellow members of leftist organizations from his brief time with the Communist Party. Afterward he went into political exile in England for a time. Producer Stanley Kramer was the first to hire him again as a director. The film was shot on location in San Francisco, though the city is not named in the film. Plot Eddie Miller (Arthur Franz), a delivery man, struggles with his hatred of women. This hatred is exacerbated if he feels drawn to a woman who turns out to be unattainable, he tends to see this as a personal affront. Also, he is especially bothered when he sees women with their significant others. Miller knows he is disturbed and, out of despair, burns himself by pressing his right hand to an electric stove. The doctor treating him in an emergency room suspects he might need psychological help, but gets too busy to follow through. Miller begins a killing spree as a sniper by shooting women from far distances with an M1 carbine. Trying to be caught, he writes an anonymous letter to the police begging them to stop him. As the killings continue, a psychologist has the keys (early criminal profiling techniques) to finding the killer. The film is unusual in that its ending is non-violent, despite its genre and expectations raised throughout. Cast * Adolphe Menjou as Police Lt.

For first refusing to testify, Dmytryk was named as one of the \\"Hollywood Ten\\", barred from work in the film industry and jailed for contempt of Congress. In April 1951 he changed his mind and testified, both about his brief time with the Communist Party and naming fellow members of leftist organizations. Afterward he went into a short political exile in England. The film's comparatively comprehensive outdoor footage of 1952 San Francisco remains unsurpassed in variety for a narrative film. Many of the film's outdoor scenes were shot in the Telegraph Hill area. One scene not shot in San Francisco, although it purports to be Playland at the Beach, was actually filmed at The Pike amusement park in Long Beach.

These chemical reactions are usually conducted at temperatures of several hundred degrees Celsius. Such processes are applied for production of the elemental forms of many elements. The ability of metals to participate in carbothermic reactions can be predicted from Ellingham diagrams. \\"Figure 8.19 Ellingham diagram for the free energy of formation of metallic oxides\\" p. 308 Carbothermal reactions produce carbon monoxide and sometimes carbon dioxide. The facility of these conversions is attributable to the entropy of reaction: two solids, the metal oxide and carbon, are converted to a new solid (metal) and a gas (CO), the latter having high entropy.  Applications  A prominent example is that of iron ore smelting. Many reactions are involved, but the simplified equation is usually shown as: : 2 + 3C → 4Fe + 3 On a more modest scale, about 1 million tons of elemental phosphorus is produced annually by carbothermic reactions. Calcium phosphate (phosphate rock) is heated to 1,200–1,500 °C with sand, which is mostly , and coke (impure carbon) to produce . The chemical equation for this process when starting with fluoroapatite, a common phosphate mineral, is: : 4 + 18 + 30C → 3 + 30CO + 18 + 2 Of historic interest is the Leblanc process. A key step in this process is the reduction of sodium sulfate with coal: : Na2SO4 \\\\+ 2 C -> Na2S + 2 CO2 The Na2S is then treated with calcium carbonate to give sodium carbonate, a commodity chemical. Recently, development of the 'MagSonic' carbothermic magnesium process has restarted interest in its chemistry: : + ↔ + The reaction is readily reversible from its product vapors, and requires rapid cooling to prevent back-reaction. = Variations = Sometimes carbothermic reactions are coupled to other conversions. One example is the chloride process for separating titanium from ilmenite, the main ore of titanium. In this process, a mixture of carbon and the crushed ore is heated at 1000 °C under flowing chlorine gas, giving titanium tetrachloride: : 2 + 7 + 6C → 2 + 2 + 6CO For some metals, carbothermic reactions do not afford the metal, but instead give the metal carbide. This behavior is observed for titanium, hence the use of the chloride process. Carbides also form upon high temperature treatment of with carbon.

Life Victor was born in Paris, son of architect Louis-Pierre Baltard and attended Lycée Henri IV. During his student days Baltard, a Lutheran, attended the Calvinist Temple du Marais with other Protestant students including Georges-Eugène Haussmann with whom he would collaborate in the latter's renovation of Paris. He later studied at the École des Beaux- Arts, where he garnered the Prix de Rome for designing a military school in 1833. He went on to study at the French Academy in Rome, Italy, from 1834 to 1838 under the direction of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. Saint-Eustache From 1849 on, he was Architect of the City of Paris. In this office, he was responsible for the restoration of several churches, as well as the construction of the Catholic Saint-Augustin (1860-67), in which he united the structural values of stone and steel. His most popular achievement was, however, the building of Les Halles, the central market in Paris, during the years 1853 to 1870. In 1972 and 1973, however, these halls were torn down. A single hall (completed in 1854) was classified as a historical monument and moved to Nogent-sur-Marne in 1971, where it is now known as the Pavillon Baltard. Victor Baltard also built the slaughterhouses and the cattle market of Les Halles de la Villette, as well as the tombs of composer Louis James Alfred Lefébure-Wély at the Père Lachaise Cemetery and of jurist Léon Louis Rostand at Montmartre Cemetery. He was largely instrumental in introducing a regular scheme of fresco decoration by modern artists in the churches of Paris, to take the place of the heterogeneous collections of pictures of all kinds with which their walls had been promiscuously decorated.

He served as Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1992 to 1993. During and after his time as Prime Minister, he campaigned for peace and democracy in the Balkan region. He ran for President of Serbia in 1992, ultimately coming in second to Slobodan MiloševićThe New York Times - Breaking News, World News & Multimedia. International Herald Tribune. in an election marked by allegations of media and vote tampering by the ruling party. Panić became Prime Minister of Yugoslavia while an American citizen. The legality of retaining US citizenship while accepting this office has been questioned based on a Constitutional prohibition of a US citizen accepting office on behalf of a foreign nation.Who is this man Milan Panic?: How did an American millionaire become Prime Minister of Yugoslavia? And what's in it for him? Keith Botsford reports - Voices. The Independent (23 July 1992). Panić is the first US citizen to occupy a high-level political position in a foreign country since Golda Meir. Outside of his political and humanitarian activities, Panić built a lengthy career in the pharmaceutical and medical industries. He grew ICN Pharmaceuticals from a small operation in his garage into a global pharmaceutical corporation listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with over $672 million in annual sales across 90 countries at its peak. After retiring from ICN, he spun off an ICN subsidiary and renamed it MP Biomedicals. The company is a global producer of life science and diagnostic products, with operations in North America, Asia, Australia, and Europe. In October 2015, Panić announced the pending sale of MP Biomedicals to a Chinese chemical company, Valiant Fine Chemicals Co., Ltd. Panić pursues philanthropy personally and through his Milan Panić Jr. Foundation, as well as MP Global Enterprises & Associates, LLC. As part of his philanthropic efforts, he has sponsored scholarships at the MIT-Harvard Medical School Program and lectured on peacebuilding at George Washington University and University of Southern California. He is also a member of the President's cabinet at Chapman University, Vice Chairman and sponsor of the Los Angeles Opera, and frequent sponsor of California cultural institutions and charities. Early lifeBirth and Youth in Serbia= Panić was born on 20 December 1929 in Belgrade, Kingdom of Yugoslavia (present-day Serbia) into a middle-class family. His father, a prominent government official, died when he was three years old, leaving Panić's mother to raise him and his sisters. Faced with a growing shortage of goods due to the Nazi occupation of Belgrade, Panić started a working vegetable farm to support his family and community. As a young student, he gravitated toward geography and chemistry, assembling a small laboratory in his room to conduct experiments. During World War II, Panić, then only 14 years old, joined Josip \\"Marshal\\" Tito’s partisan resistance to fight the growing Nazi influence in Yugoslavia. After returning from military service, he resumed his secondary studies in biochemistry at the Belgrade Faculty of Technology. Panić enrolled as a medical student at the University of Belgrade medical school before transferring to the biochemistry degree program. =Cycling career= Panić was an avid cyclist from his youth into early adulthood. Over the course of his cycling career, he eventually rose to become a Yugoslavian national champion and competed at the international level on prominent teams including the Yugoslavian national and Olympic teams. While traveling to an international cycling tournament in the Netherlands in 1955, Panić defected to Austria with his wife Jelica Panić (née Narandžić.) =Defection and Refugee Status= After defecting to Austria in August 1955, Panić and his wife applied for asylum in Germany and moved to a West German refugee camp. While in Germany, he enrolled in the PhD program at the University of Heidelberg and worked as a furniture mover. After receiving asylum in Germany several months after his initial arrival, Panić applied for a program that resettled refugees in the United States. Upon their acceptance into the program, he and Jelica moved to Fontana, California in early 1956. Panić worked in labs at Keiser Steel and the University of Southern California, where he also studied biochemistry. In 1959, Panić decided to start his own business, the International Chemical and Nuclear Corporation (ICN). Political and Public Service in EuropePrime Minister of Yugoslavia= In July 1992, Panić assumed the position of Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, at the request of Yugoslav President Dobrica Ćosić and Serbian President Slobodan Milošević. Panić set out goals of achieving peace, drafting a constitution, lifting U.N. sanctions, and pushing for the closure of concentration camps. In August 1992, he played a central role in the London International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, which called for international attention to the country's worsening economic and political situation. At the conference, Panić submitted a twelve-point Plan for Peace. One month later, Panić delivered a \\"Speech of Peace\\" address in front of the United Nations General Assembly. On 2 December 1992, Panić announced his intention to challenge Milošević for the Serbian presidency, campaigning on a platform of economic reforms and bringing a peaceful resolution to the Bosnian War. Panić contended that Milošević had crippled Serbia by allowing unemployment and inflation to rise, while inciting isolation and sanctions by the international community. Panić appealed directly to Serbian youth and older voters seeking a compromise in the ongoing conflict that included recognition of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina in their current borders. In the 1992 Serbian general election, Panić came in second behind Milošević, receiving 32% of votes cast. In the aftermath, observers at the Helsinki Commission, political experts, and journalists alleged that Milošević and his supporters had manipulated the election results through improper use of state media and vote tampering. =Yugoslavia Peace Efforts and Dayton Accords= Following his term as Prime Minister, Panić stayed involved in the effort to restore peace and democracy in the region. In December 1993, he began correspondence with U.S. President Bill Clinton regarding a proposed peace summit with all heads of state of the former Yugoslavia. In 1994, he met with Clinton and his advisers in California to discuss the proposal further. Following additional discussions over the next two years, in which Panić proposed a Balkans peace conference, the Clinton Administration convened the Conference on Establishing Peace at Wright- Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, USA. The Conference culminated in the signing of the Dayton Accords on 21 November 1995, which brought an end to the Bosnian War by dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina into two separate entities: The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska. Since the end of the war, Panić has continued to push for democracy in the Yugoslav region by convening political activists and advocating in the media. Business careerLaunch of ICN= In 1959, Panić launched ICN out of his garage just outside of Los Angeles, CA using $200 in startup capital. His initial business model was built upon synthesizing chemical compounds to sell to California research labs. During the 1960s, ICN marketed a generic version of L-Dopa, a widely used Parkinson's disease antidote. Panić led ICN over the following decades to develop the building blocks for several thousand potential new drugs. As ICN grew, Panić moved his operations from Pasadena, CA to a new research lab in Costa Mesa, CA and renamed the company ICN Pharmaceuticals. In 1967, ICN was officially listed on the New York Stock Exchange. =Discovery of Ribavirin and Production of Virazole= In 1972, ICN discovered the ribavirin compound, the earliest recorded broad spectrum antiviral agent. Chemists Joseph T. Witkovski and Ronald K. Robins were integral to the compound's creation. In 1985, ribavirin was approved under the name Virazole by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), an upper respiratory tract disease that primarily affects children. In 1991, ICN created the SPAG-2 (Small Particle Aerosol Generator) nebulizer to administer an aerosolized form of ribavirin during hospital treatments of specific viral infections. In 1985, ICN and the Eastman-Kodak company launched a six-year, $45 million joint venture to research drugs that slow, halt, or reverse the aging process. Between 1986 and 1987, the FDA contended that ICN had exaggerated Virazole's effectiveness in treating other illnesses including the AIDS virus. ICN settled with the FDA in 1991. In January 1988, ICN acquired 7.3% of Swiss pharmaceutical company Hoffman-La Roche, as part of a reported acquisition strategy to expand ICN's reach and marketing capabilities. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall, ICN acquired multiple pharmaceutical firms in Eastern Europe. In May 1991, ICN bought 75% of Galenika, Yugoslavia's largest drug maker at the time. After eight months, the new subsidiary ICN-Galenika was producing revenues of $364 million. In April 1992, ICN Pharmaceuticals and ICN-Galenika partially financed a $100,000 initiative to vaccinate children in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. In 1995, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigated ICN over shareholder concerns related to Mr. Panić's sale of company stock before a key regulatory decision by the FDA. After a three-year investigation, the SEC dropped its inquiry in 1998 with no charges filed. =Global Success and End of Tenure at ICN= In 1998, the FDA approved Virazole for the treatment of Hepatitis C in conjunction with another medication called interferon. Virazole eventually became a global standard treatment for multiple pediatric and adult medical conditions. Uses include the effective treatment of chronic Hepatitis C in conjunction with interferon, multiple viral fevers including influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, measles, Crimean- Congo hemorrhagic fever and Lassa fever, as well as renal impairment and thyroid cancer. During the 1990s, Panić resolved four sexual harassment suits filed by former employees of ICN. In 2002, ICN settled an SEC civil lawsuit related to misleading statements issued regarding their products. Panić decided to retire as CEO and Chairman of ICN in June 2002 after opposing shareholders took control of ICN's Board of Directors. Over the course of his career as Chairman, CEO, and President, Panić led ICN to annual sales in 90 countries exceeding $672 million (USD), with over 600 drugs in its portfolio by his final year in 2001. Panić maintains other business entities and investments both in the U.S. and internationally. In 2003, after Panić's departure, ICN Pharmaceuticals changed its name to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. =MP Biomedicals= After retiring from ICN, Panić bought a bioassay subsidiary of ICN Biomedicals and changed its name to MP Biomedicals. MP specializes in research and development of life science and diagnostic products. MP's global headquarters is located in Santa Ana, California, with its US headquarters and central distribution center located in Solon, Ohio. The company maintains global operations in North America, South America, Asia, Australia, and Europe. On 14 June 2010, Panić and MP acquired ICPBio International LTD., a New Zealand-based protein biologics manufacturing company. On 11 December 2014, the FDA approved MP Diagnostics HTLV Blot 2.4, the first FDA-licensed supplemental test for Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus-I/II (HTLV-I/II). In October 2015, Panić announced the sale of MP Biomedicals to China-based Valiant Fine Chemicals Co. Ltd., a developer of chemical products. Personal life Panić provides philanthropic support to various universities, research programs, museums, political causes and charities through both his Milan Panić Jr. Foundation and MP Global Enterprises & Associates, LLC. As part of his philanthropic efforts, he has supported the Muscular Dystrophy Association and sponsored scholarships at the MIT-Harvard Medical School Program.

It is based on the book by Terry Ryan, and stars Julianne Moore, Woody Harrelson, and Laura Dern. The film received a limited release on October 14, 2005. Plot The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio is based on the true story of housewife Evelyn Ryan, who helped support her husband, Kelly, and their 10 children by winning jingle-writing contests. Kelly failed to support his family, in part due to apparent alcoholism. He dreamed of being a singer, but lost his singing voice in a car accident, and was often cruel and abusive. Evelyn wins a large freezer, ice buckets, a washer, and dryer set, a trip to New York City, sleds, boots, a pony, a palm tree, a window, a sports car, a shopping spree in her local grocery store, ice crushers, a camera, dance shoes, a boat motor, pogo sticks, a case of dog food, and a lifetime supply of bird seed. Kelly, who feels like his role as provider for the family is being threatened, criticizes Evelyn, and damages the prizes she wins. Their children side with her. Kelly gets angry at Evelyn, and accidentally knocks her over while she is carrying 12 full glass bottles of milk, causing her to nearly sever a ligament. Evelyn is able to talk him down after each incident, and, temporarily at least, he treats her better. Evelyn is largely isolated because of the hours she has to spend caring for the children, and the lack of local intellectual equals. However, she is contacted by a group of other contest-entering mid-western housewives, and befriends them. Ultimately, Evelyn discovers that Kelly had secretly taken out a second mortgage on their house and never made payments on it, leaving the family subject to an almost-certain foreclosure. The children pray for their mother's miraculous victory in a contest sponsored by Dr Pepper. She wins, and pays the mortgage on the house. Years later, it is revealed that after Kelly died, Evelyn finds out that he has placed his pension checks in a bank account especially for her. The actual Ryan children are then shown as adults.

The site's consensus states: \\"Noteworthy for Julianne Moore's performance, Prize Winner is nonetheless a largely indistinct and tentative film that fails to convey the true power of its bittersweet tale.\\" Metacritic reported a score of 58/100 (citing \\"mixed or average reviews\\"), based on reviews from 28 critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, remarking that the movie \\"avoids obvious sentiment and predictable emotion, and shows this woman somehow holding it together year after year, entering goofy contests that, for her family, mean life and death\\".The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio (movie review), Chicago Sun-Times, September 30, 2005. Retrieved 2008-01-13.

It is known for mixing diverse music styles from around the world with pop and rock. Many critics consider Karnak's music style to be world music, although the band rejects this label, claiming that its \\"ethnic\\" sound results from their intuition, not from researches. BiographyCreation= In 1991, the lead singer and guitarist, André Abujamra, had ended his musical duo Os Mulheres Negras with Maurício Pereira and went travelling throughout the world with an audio recorder in his hand, collecting every kind of music he could find, with the idea of creating a band that combined these various styles with Brazilian regional music and modern styles like rock, pop and electronic music. One of the destinations of his trip was the ancient tombs of Karnak. He was deeply affected by those tombs and decided to name his band after it. Upon returning to Brazil, he recruited musicians, mostly from among his friends. He even kept two drummers in the band because both were old friends and he could not dismiss one of them. The project swelled to include ten musicians, two actors and a dog. The band rehearsed for a year before playing a concert, and soon became known for its unusual shows featuring comedy sketches and unusual attire, especially a penchant for odd hats. =First album, recognition in Brazil= In 1995, Karnak released its first album, Karnak. The album was released by the now defunct Brazilian label Tinitus. After the label's demise, the album was re- released some years after by Net Records. The album was praised by critics but received little airtime on commercial radio. However, Karnak became well-known on university radio stations around São Paulo and it even had some videos played in Brazilian MTV. =Second album, international tours= The band's second album, Universo Umbigo (Bellybutton Universe), in 1997, was released by Velas, another now-defunct label. The lineup had by this time reached its apex, with fifteen persons, including a belly dancer. In Brazil, the album had less impact that the first one, and to this day it is out of catalog and available only as download at emusic stores under the name of Karnak Universo. Although it did not do well in Brazil, it became popular to some extent on college radio in the United States. After the release, Karnak toured the United States, Canada and Europe in 1998. The name of the band was changed to \\"The Karnak\\", but quickly changed it back. Several members left the band, bringing the total membership down to nine. In the same year, Karnak released a \\"best of\\" album in France, called Original. The album included songs from the first two albums, plus a French version of the song \\"Alma Não Tem Cor\\" (Souls don't have colors) and a remix of the song \\"Comendo Uva na Chuva\\" (Eating grapes in the rain) by André Abujamra. =Third album= After returning to Brazil the next year, the band started to record its third album, Estamos Adorando Tóquio (We are loving Tokio). With the lineup down to seven members, the album was released in 2000 by Net Records, an independent label that aims to find alternative ways of distributing and selling with lower costs, making the records less tempting to music pirates. The album was sold in newspaper stands at a cheaper price than in record stores. The band toured internationally again in 2001. The album was as successful as the first one. Although in the mainstream media its impact was not as great as the 1995 record, the band played more shows, gathered more fans and became a little more known outside São Paulo. =Hiatus= On 16 December 2002, Abujamra wrote a message to Karnak producer Belma Ikeda which she forwarded to the largest e-mail based discussion list about the band. The content of the message stunned the fans: it explained that the band felt that a cycle was finished, so they were stopping their activities. Their two scheduled shows for the following week would be their last. The concerts were converted into a celebration of the band's existence, and included all Karnak members and ex- members, totaling almost twenty people on stage. The next year, 2003, a two- disc compilation of \\"pirate\\" live recordings was officially released, under the name Os Piratas do Karnak (The pirates of Karnak). =Returning to activities= Although Abujamra confirmed that Karnak was finished, it has performed at least once a year since 2003, usually in SESC Pompéia, a culture complex located in São Paulo. In one of these seasonal performances, in 2006, Abujamra announced that the band was resuming its activities. He attributed their pause, humorously or not, to his uncertainty on whether or not he would survive gastric bypass surgery. He promised that the band would record a new album with new original songs. Karnak can be seen now giving concerts in the city of São Paulo and sometimes in other nearby cities. The lineup changes constantly from one gig to another, except for the \\"golden members\\", who are present at almost every show. =Karnak's Multicolored Book= At the end of 2006 the mockumentary The Karnak's Multicolored Book was released. The film narrates a fictitious behind-the-scenes record a 2004 secret Chinese tour, but in fact it documents the bands supposed \\"final gig\\" in 2002. It was premiered in the 30th annual São Paulo International Film Festival, and is available for download on orkut.

It was very popular in Africa. The dance was popularized by soukous music videos, as well as the videos of Kanda Bongo Man, Pepe Kalle, Viva La Musica, and other Congolese musicians. For the first time in Congo, all the groups adopted these dance steps. This had not happened before because bands preferred to have their own specific dance. Etymology The words kwassa kwassa may have come from the French quoi ça? (\\"what [is] that?\\"). Origins In the 1980s, Kanda Bongo Man, a Paris-based artist, pioneered fast, short soukous tracks suitable for play on dance floors everywhere, and popularly known as kwassa kwassa after the dance moves popularized by his and other artists' music videos. This music appealed to Africans and to new audiences as well. Artists such as Diblo Dibala, Jeannot Bel Musumbu, Mbilia Bel, Yondo Sister, Tinderwet, Loketo, Rigo Star, Madilu System, Soukous Stars and veterans including Pepe Kalle and Koffi Olomide followed suit. Soon, Paris became home to talented studio musicians who recorded for the African and Caribbean markets and filled out bands for occasional tours. A slower version of this genre has been created and popularized by Koffi Olomide and his band Quartier Latin. Their songs have enjoyed massive airplay throughout Africa in countries such as Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Senegal and others. Metavo is also very popular in South Africa. This kind of beat is referenced in the 2008 song \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\" by American indie rock band Vampire Weekend.

Life The son of Diomid Leu, a clergyman and teacher, and Zenovia Gârlea, a primary school teacher, he went to secondary school in Chernivtsi and Hotin, taking his baccalaureat exam in Chernivtsi in 1937.

It was first published in the horror anthology Shock Rock and later included in King's collection Nightmares & Dreamscapes. It concerns a young couple on a road trip in Oregon when they accidentally wander into a small town inhabited by dead rock and roll legends. The title of the work, and the name of the town—Rock and Roll Heaven—both come from the chorus of \\"Rock and Roll Heaven\\", a song first recorded by Climax in 1973 and was a Top 10 hit by The Righteous Brothers the following year. Plot summary Clark and Mary Willingham are a couple traveling through Oregon. Clark is being transferred out of state, so they opt to take a more scenic route. The two plan to visit Toketee Falls, and Clark insists on taking a road through the deep forest despite Mary's fears of becoming lost. While Mary takes a nap, Clark does indeed become increasingly lost on a narrow stretch of road. He is forced to admit to Mary that he's given up hope of finding Toketee Falls and that, furthermore, he had rejected an opportunity to turn around. Frustrated, yet hesitant to push the issue, Mary agrees to press forward in the hopes of reaching a point where they can safely turn around. The couple abruptly comes upon a sign announcing, \\"Welcome to Rock and Roll Heaven, Ore.\\" The road becomes wider and paved, giving them another chance to turn around. Again, Clark refuses, arguing that it would be easier and safer to do so inside the town itself. They discover Rock and Roll Heaven is a small town with a 1950s theme, described as looking identical to a Norman Rockwell painting. Mary feels worried about the too-perfect town, but Clark becomes irritated and the two argue, although Mary can sense that he is also alarmed. As the two explore the town, Clark insists on entering a local diner. Afraid of being left alone, she follows. Inside the diner, Clark and Mary notice two employees resemble dead musicians. After a waitress named Sissy Thomas (CeCe Pryor in the film version) attempts to warn them off, Clark slips out, and Mary is confronted by the two employees, Janis Joplin and Rick Nelson and two other dead musicians, Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison. At first cordial and friendly, one begins to bleed from his eyes and another vomits hundreds of maggots, revealing that they've simply been playing with her. Clark and Mary drive frantically through the town, chased by dead music legends. As they drive, Mary notices other citizens of Rock and Roll Heaven, all of whom look exhausted and apathetic; she realizes that these are the \\"true\\" inhabitants, lured in and trapped in the town. Mary and Clark think they have escaped but are easily captured in the outskirts of town after hitting a psychedelic bus. The mayor (a deceased Elvis Presley) steps off the bus and the chief of police pulls up. The musicians ominously reveal that they couldn't have escaped, as the road out is surrounded by swamp, quicksand, bears, and \\"other things\\". As the sun begins to set over Rock and Roll Heaven, Mary and Clark join the ranks of the other imprisoned souls in the park, where the concert is prepared. Mary looks at the other exhausted townsfolk, and chooses to sit next to the waitress from the diner. The young woman has the glazed look of one who is stoned, and talks with the couple. She tells them that her name is Sissy, and reveals that one of her fingers was cut off by Frankie Lymon as punishment for assisting the pair. She also explains that while the concerts must end at midnight, \\"time is different\\" in Rock and Roll Heaven; the songs sometimes go on for years. The disc jockey Alan Freed takes the stage and begins to announce an endless series of legendary rock stars. Mary voices her worst fear when she asks Sissy her age; she is twenty-three, and has been that way for seven years. Mary realizes that these are the people who get \\"lost in the woods\\" and didn't do anything wrong to deserve this, as Freed continues to scream the names of musicians. He finally shouts: \\"Rock and roll will never die!\\", to which Mary thinks the last line of the story: \\"That's what I'm afraid of.\\" Famous inhabitantsThe diner= * Janis Joplin, waitress at the diner * Ricky Nelson, cook at the diner * Roy Orbison * Buddy Holly =Around town= * Ronnie Van Zant * Duane Allman * Berry Oakley * Otis Redding, police officer * Elvis Presley, mayor * Frankie Lymon * Jimi Hendrix, teleplay only * Jim Morrison, the Lizard King =The concert= * Alan Freed, M.C. at the concert * Freddie Mercury * Florence Ballard * Mary Wells * Patsy Cline * Jim Croce * Stevie Ray Vaughan * Keith Moon * Marvin Gaye * John Lennon * Cass Elliot * John Bonham * Brian Jones * J.

He also compares and contrasts it with several others, including Children of the Corn and Rainy Season, ultimately rejecting the criticism that it is self- imitation. Instead, he posits that certain horror themes have become archetypes that transcend the superficial plots and instead are about what they cause you to feel. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations The story was adapted as one of the episodes of the 2006 Turner Network Television series Nightmares & Dreamscapes: From the Stories of Stephen King. Bryan Pope of DVD Verdict rated the episode D+ and said that \\"there's nothing remotely scary about deceased pop icons\\". In a negative review, Christopher Nosecki of DVD Talk called it \\"a one note punchline\\".

Originally the seating accommodated nearly 4,000 people, but several hundred seats were removed in the 1930s to make more comfortable accommodations in the orchestra area; there are now 3,019 seats at Shea's. The interior was designed by world-renowned designer/artist Louis Comfort Tiffany with most of the elements still in place today. Many of the furnishings and fixtures were supplied by Marshall Field in Chicago and included immense Czechoslovakian crystal chandeliers of the finest quality. The interior contained over of seating. The cost of construction and outfitting of the theater in 1926 was just over $1.9 million. This was at a time when a new house could be purchased for $3,000 and a new Model A Ford was $1,000. The theater opened January 16, 1926, with the film King of Main Street, starring Adolphe Menjou. When Michael Shea retired in 1930, Shea's interests were headed by V. R. McFaul, who owned and managed several dozen Shea's Theaters in the metro Buffalo area until his death in 1955. Loew's Theatres took over the chain's interests in 1948. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs The theatre had a not-so-unusual history of falling into some disrepair in the 1960s and 1970s when downtown Buffalo was in decline. It was operated at that time by Loew's Corporation as primarily a showcase for \\"Blacksploitation\\" films such as the \\"Super Fly\\" series. The theatre was owned at that time by Leon Lawrence Sidell, who was failing to pay his taxes. A small group of folks, led by Curt Mangel, and including Steve LaManna, Ben Hiltz, Dan Harter and 9 others known as the original \\"Friends of the Buffalo\\" theatre began doing work on the organ, and Mr. Mangel became the engineer of the building. Mr. Mangel, and others, at times, actually lived in the building, in the upper floors of the dressing rooms for almost a year, while working on various needs of the theatre. When it became apparent that the theatre would default to the city on back taxes owed by Leon Lawrence Sidell, Loew's was preparing to leave and strip the theatre of its contents. The Friends went through the theatre and inventoried every item. In a landmark court decision, a judge blocked Loew's from removing the contents, including chandeliers, furniture, organ and projection equipment. The claim was that Loew's owned these items, and legal counter-argument stated that the items were an integral part of the theatre. The judge actually toured the theatre, including the organ chambers, and ruled for the Friends and the City. The building, which could be considered a very high-profile political football, came under the watchful eye of then Comptroller George O'Connell, for whom the theatre was later surnamed. Under his watch, and the Friends, the theatre was able to keep its utilities running, and repair began. The Friends of the Buffalo were then given operating privileges of the building and undertook massive restoration through government grants and developed a performance series in the late 1970s. Broadway Theatre manager and producer (Mummenschanz) Robert B. D'Angelo were brought in as CEO in the late 1970s. In his short span at the helm, he booked multi-week engagements of several major broadway national tours including A Chorus Line, Chicago, Annie and Les Misérables, helping to reestablish Buffalo as an important stop on the Broadway tour circuit. A Grand re-opening was mounted to a sold-out audience in the late 1970s with Cab Calloway and George Burns. Calloway had performed at the theatre at its original opening week in 1926 and Burns had performed there in the late 1940s. The volunteer Friends of the Buffalo group was replaced by a professional management team. The Friends continued to enlarge its volunteer base, which worked on various restoration projects, including the Wurlitzer Organ. The theatre is a hugely successful performance center, having undergone a large expansion of its stage facilities to accommodate larger touring productions. Additionally, it is used as a host site for area events, such as the 43North entrepreneurship competition. Performers at Shea's from New York and southern Ontario have included The Ink Spots in 1939, Frank Sinatra for six nights in 1941, Ella Fitzgerald in 1945, Foreigner in 1977, Toronto in 1980, Blue Öyster Cult in 1984, 10,000 Maniacs in 1988, Eddie Money in 1988, Liza Minnelli in 1992, Peter, Paul and Mary in 1993, Toronto's Barenaked Ladies in 1994, Buffalo's Goo Goo Dolls in 1995, 1999 and 2018; Toronto's Our Lady Peace in 1998, and Ontario's Gordon Lightfoot in 2008, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber in 2009, Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock with Kurtis Blow and Salt N Pepa in 2011, Public Enemy in 2012, Jerry Seinfeld in 2013, comedian Bill Maher in 2015, Mary J. Blige in 2015, and Steely Dan in 2017.https://www.setlist.fm/search?page=36&query;=Shea%27s+Buffalo Organ The theater's \\"Mighty Wurlitzer\\" was a custom design built by the Wurlitzer Company and was one of only 5 in the world that had tonal finishing, provided directly from the Wurlitzer factory, after it had been installed in the theater. The organ was used as a demonstrator by the Wurlitzer Factory, in nearby North Tonawanda, whenever a visiting customer wanted to hear an example of a 4 manual (keyboard) organ installed in a theater. [The demonstrator for a 3 manual (keyboard) organ was the Riviera Theatre in North Tonawanda, NY.] Built originally to provide silent film accompaniment, like many of the thousands of instruments like it, fell into disrepair, rarely being heard in the 1940s, and 1950's. It was made operational by the American Theatre Organ Enthusiasts, (now the American Theatre Organ Society or ATOS) for a series of memorable concerts. On or around that time, a valuable set of Brass Trumpets, special pipework of a theatre organ, was stolen. It then sat virtually silent again until the late 1970s, when it was made playable again by the Friends of the Buffalo for the Grand Re-opening of the theatre. In the late 1970s, the Wurlitzer underwent a huge restoration, provided by monetary grants from various arts organizations, including complete replacement of the relay (switching) system that controlled the organ, as well as restoration of windchests, missing pipe replacements, wiring, and organ console work. The revitalized organ was premiered to the public with a sold-out concert by noted theatre organist Lyn Larsen. Since that time it has been used for solo concerts, silent films, and background music prior to and after events in the theatre. In 2006, to commemorate the theater's 80th birthday, the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of conductor JoAnn Falletta played a concert there with Anthony Newman playing the organ. Highlights of the program included Camille Saint-Saëns \\"Organ\\" Symphony 3 in C minor, selections from The Phantom of the Opera, Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, and Louis Vierne's Carillon de Westminster.

The texts have also been set by other composers including Morales. Victoria includes settings of the movements of the Requiem Mass, accounting for about 26 minutes of the 42 minute composition, and the work is sometimes referred to as Victoria's Requiem. However, it is not his only requiem, in 1583, Victoria composed and published a book of Masses, reprinted in 1592, including a Missa pro defunctis for four-part choir. History From the 1580s Victoria worked at a convent in Madrid where he served as chaplain to the Dowager Empress Maria, sister of Philip II of Spain, daughter of Charles V, wife of Maximilian II and mother of two emperors. Officium Defunctorum was composed for the funeral of the Empress Maria. She died on February 26, 1603 and the great obsequies were performed on April 22 and 23. =Publication= Victoria published eleven volumes of his music during his lifetime, representing the majority of his compositional output. Officium Defunctorum, the only work to be published by itself, was the eleventh volume and the last work Victoria published. It was dedicated to Princess Margaret, who was a nun in the same convent as her mother, for “the obsequies of your most revered mother”.Turner. The date of publication, 1605, is often included with the title to differentiate the Officium Defunctorum from Victoria's other setting of the Requiem Mass. Structure Officium Defunctorum is scored for six-part SSATTB chorus. It was possibly intended to be sung with two singers to each part. It includes an entire Office of the Dead: in addition to a Requiem Mass, Victoria sets an extra-liturgical funeral motet, a lesson that belongs to Matins (scored for only SATB and not always included in concert performances), and the ceremony of Absolution which follows the Mass. Polyphonic sections are separated by unaccompanied chant incipits Victoria printed himself. The Soprano II usually carries the cantus firmus, though \\"it very often disappears into the surrounding part-writing since the chant does not move as slowly as most cantus firmus parts and the polyphony does not generally move very fast.\\" Phillips. The sections of the work are as follows: *Taedet animam meam :Second Lesson of Matins (Job 10:1–7) *Missa Pro Defunctis (Mass for the Dead) :With the Council of Trent, the liturgy of the Requiem Mass was standardized.

The paper is based in London and is published every Thursday. History The Voice was founded in 1982 by Val McCalla, who, while working on a London local paper called the East End News in 1981, led a group of businessmen and journalists in a new and uncertain endeavour – the creation of a weekly newspaper to cater for the interests of British-born Afro-Caribbean people. Until then the Afro-Caribbean press in Britain had always addressed a generation of immigrants, relaying news from their countries of origin in the Caribbean and Africa. Publications were named accordingly, with titles such as the West Indian Gazette, West Indian World, The Caribbean Times and West Africa. According to Beulah Ainley, who worked with McCalla on the East End News, \\"nobody thought the Voice would work\\",Andy Beckett, \\"The Voice in the Wilderness\\", The Independent, 11 February 1996. however, as The Independent has noted: \\"The previous summer, Brixton had rioted, and Afro-caribbean enterprises of all kinds were now being encouraged in the hope of preventing a repetition. London's councils, in particular, were keen to advertise for black staff, and even keener to do so in an Afro- Caribbean newspaper. McCalla also had a business partner, Alex Pascall, with BBC connections; soon the Corporation was advertising too.\\" The Voice got off the ground with a £62,000 loan from Barclays Bank. At a time when Afro- Caribbean businesses found it particularly hard to get backing from banks, The Voice was helped by two factors. One was Barclays' desire to show support for Afro-Caribbean causes, to counteract the adverse publicity attracted by their investments in South Africa, for which the bank had been boycotted by the anti-apartheid movement.Lionel Morrison, A Century of Black Journalism in Britain: A Kaleidoscopic View of Race and the Media (1893-2003), Truebay Limited, March 2007, p. 64. The other was the existence of the Loan Guarantee Scheme, set up by the Conservative government as part of Margaret Thatcher's policy of aiding and encouraging the growth of small businesses in Britain. Under the Loan Guarantee Scheme the Government secured 80% of the loan, thereby reducing the risk taken by the bank. As it turned out, the loan was fully paid off within five years. The first issue of The Voice was printed to coincide with the Notting Hill Carnival in August 1982. Its cover price was 54 pence, and was only sold in London. The Voice′s first office was in Mare Street, Hackney, East London.\\"City Hall Hosts Voice Newspaper Exhibition\\", The Voice, 19 October 2017. The newspaper's first editor, Flip Fraser,Elizabeth Pears, \\"Black Hero Flip Fraser Joins The Hall Of Fame\\", The Gleaner, 7 September 2014. led a team of young journalists who set about addressing the issues that mattered to Britain's Afro-Caribbean community. They laid the foundation for the future success of the paper, combining human-interest stories and coverage of sports, fashion and entertainment with hard news and investigative reporting. Within two decades it had become \\"Britain's most successful Afro-caribbean newspaper\\". In 1996, The Voice fought off a challenge from the New Nation, which sought to position itself as an \\"upbeat, aspirational publication\\", rather than the typically \\"advocacy journalism\\" contained within The Voice.{Decca Aitkenhead, \\"Black and successful?

At the launch of the New Nation newspaper, the paper's editor, Richard Adeshiyan, referred to The Voice as a \\"doom-and- gloom sheet\\" which prints damaging images of blacks as victims. On 30 July 2020, The Voice received widespread criticism for publishing an interview with rapper Wiley shortly after he posted a series of anti-Semitic comments on social media. Rather than challenging Wiley on his comments, the interview asked Wiley if he felt he made any \\"salient points\\". This received widespread criticism from many Jewish leaders, with music producer Mark Ronson tweeting a series of comments criticising the publication.. On 31 July, the article was removed, with The Voice issuing a statement apologising for any offence caused by the article.

Early years Gerald Mohr in the CBS Radio series The Adventures of Philip Marlowe (1948–1951) Mohr was born in Manhattan to Henrietta (née Neustadt), a singer, and Sigmond Mohr. He was educated in Dwight Preparatory School in Manhattan, where he learned to speak fluent French and German and also learned to ride horses and play the piano. At Columbia University, where he was on a course to become a doctor, Mohr was struck with appendicitis and was recovering in a hospital when another patient, a radio broadcaster, realised Mohr's pleasant baritone voice would be ideal for radio. Mohr was hired by the radio station and became a junior reporter. Stage In the mid-1930s, Orson Welles invited him to join his formative Mercury Theatre. During his time with Welles, Mohr gained theatrical experience on Broadway in The Petrified Forest and starred in Jean Christophe. Radio Mohr made more than 500 appearances in radio roles throughout the 1930s, '40s, and early '50s. One of his early starring roles on radio was as a replacement for Matt Crowley for a brief interval in Jungle Jim in 1938.

In the early 1950s, Mohr made a series of recordings for the Voice of America. Unlike most material for the VOA, these were intended for broadcast by radio stations in the United States, with the goal of debunking propaganda broadcast from behind the Iron Curtain. Film Mohr began appearing in films in the late 1930s, playing his first villain role in the 15-part cliffhanger serial Jungle Girl (1941). After three years' service in the US Army Air Forces during World War II, he returned to Hollywood, starring as Michael Lanyard in three movies of The Lone Wolf series in 1946–47.

The company was to have featured comedy, adventure, crime, and drama shows for worldwide distribution. By then fluent in Swedish, he also planned to star in a film for TV in which his character, a newspaperman, would speak only Swedish. In 1964, he made a comedy Western, filmed in Stockholm and on location in Yugoslavia, called Wild West Story in which, unusually, the good guys spoke Swedish and the bad guys (Mohr, inter alia) spoke in English. He also essayed Captain Vadim, an Iron Curtain submarine commander, in the Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea episode \\"The Lost Bomb\\". He continued to market his powerful voice, playing Reed Richards (Mister Fantastic) in the Fantastic Four cartoon series during 1967 and Green Lantern in the 1968 animated series Aquaman.

Produced by Toei Company Ltd., the series aired on Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) from April 16 to September 24, 1967, with a total of 24 episodes. This series is based very loosely on Captain Future, the pulp science fiction saga created by the influential Edmond Hamilton. This was not the only time his work was adapted in Japan: Captain Future was officially adapted into an anime series by Toei Doga in 1978, and that same year, Tsuburaya Productions adapted his Starwolf novels into a tokusatsu sci-fi action series of the same title. Originally, this series was aired by Tokyo Broadcasting System right after the end of the original Ultraman show to serve as a filler series while Tsuburaya Productions geared up for the production of Ultra Seven. So only 24 episodes of Captain Ultra were ordered by the network. So, the week following the conclusion of Captain Ultra, Ultra Seven premiered on TBS. Still, while short-lived, the series has been released in Japan on all of the major home video formats since the 1980s: VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD. In 2005, a tankōbon volume of the original serialized manga illustrated by Shunji Obata in Shogakukan's Weekly Shōnen Sunday in 1967 was published by Manga Shop. Captain Ultra is among the more memorable tokusatsu series from the 1960s, and was one of the three cornerstones of Toei's programs of 1967, including Akakage and Giant Robo (better known in the US as Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot). Some Japanese fans also compare the looks of Captain Ultra to that of Captain Scarlet, the title hero of Sylvia and Gerry Anderson's Supermarionation series, Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons (which had been shown in Japan around the same time and was very popular). The series was aired in the Takeda Hour block (sponsored by the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company).

The case was referred to the Court on 7 April 1993 from an application lodged on 28 September 1988 relating to events occurring in 1982. The case was heard in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 24 January 1994 and the Chamber delivered their judgement on 28 October 1994. The applicants were six Irish citizens, all members of the same family: Margaret Murray, Thomas Murray, Mark Murray, Allana Murray, Michaela Murray and Rosena Murray. In June 1982 two brothers of Margaret Murray were convicted in the United States in connection with the supplying of weapons to the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA). Mrs Murray, her husband Thomas, and their four children were then residing in Belfast. On the morning of 26 July, Margaret Murray was taken into custody by the Army on suspicion of fund-raising for the Provisional IRA in connection with her brothers' activities and taken to the Springfield Road screening centre. The style and procedure of her arrest was under section 14 of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1978, her suspected offences were contained with section 21 of the act and also section 10 of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1976. At Springfield Road, Mrs Murray gave her name but refused to answer any other questions and she also declined to be photographed or to submit to an examination by a medical orderly. She sat through two short interviews and was also photographed without her knowledge or consent. She was released after two hours without being charged; the \\"screening proforma\\" record form did not list any offence. On 9 February 1984 Mrs Murray brought an action before the High Court against the Ministry of Defence for false imprisonment and other torts, arguing that her arrest and detention were illegal on a number of grounds - notably that they had been without genuine suspicion that she had committed an offence or any genuine intention to question her, it had been a \\"fishing expedition\\" for improper purposes. In his judgment of 25 October 1985 the judge dismissed all the plaintiff's arguments. Mrs Murray took her case to the Court of Appeal, which unanimously rejected her claims on 20 February 1987. The case was appealed to the House of Lords – on the manner of the arrest, the use of the screening proforma, and the length of detention – and was unanimously rejected on 25 May 1988. The Murrays applied to the ECHR, as previously noted, in 1988. Mrs Murray stating that her arrest and detention were a violation of Article 5 (paragraphs 1, 2 and 5) and that the photograph and record taking was in breach of Article 8. Her family also applied under the same parts of Article 5 because they had been required to assemble in a single room of their house while Mrs Murray prepared to leave with the Army. They also applied under Article 8 in regard to the recording and retention of personal details. The entire family also applied that under Article 8 regarding the entry and visual search of their home and under Article 13 that no effective remedies existed under domestic law. In February 1993 the Commission supported the Murrays' application in part. There had been a violation of Article 5, but no violation of Article 8, or of Article 13 in regard to the entry and search, or the taking and keeping of a photograph and personal details, or concerning the lack of remedies in domestic law. The case went to a public hearing on 24 January 1994. At the hearing the Court gave significant weight to the need for a democratic society to protect itself against the threat of organised terrorism and to the problems involved in the arrest and detention of persons suspected of terrorist-linked offences. The Court dismissed Mrs Murray's claims against her arrest and detention under 5(1)(c); dismissed her contention that she had not been informed promptly of the reasons for the arrest and of any charge (5(2)). Since there had been no violation of 5(1) or 5(2) in the Court's opinion there could be no consideration of 5(5). The Court decided that there had been no violation of Article 8 as the Army's action had been in accordance with the law, as contained in paragraph two of the Article, and had not been disproportionate to the aim pursued. The Court dismissed the Murrays' claims of a violation of Article 13. The Court's decisions were by majority – 14–4 in regard of Article 5(1), 13–5 in regard of Article 5(2), 13–5 in regard of Article 5(5), 15–3 in regard of Article 8, and unanimous in regard of Article 13.

He was also made a water bailiff and watched boat traffic on Port Jackson from a special tower. Although Billy Blue's place and date of birth are uncertain, convict records suggest he was born in Jamaica, New York, around 1740 or 1767. Other people reading his records believe him to have been from Jamaica, West Indies. In 1817, Governor Macquarie granted Billy Blue at what is now Blues Point, which was named after him. Early life Physically imposing, he was described as a \\"strapping Jamaican Negro 'a very Hercules in proportion' with a bright eye and a jocular wit\\". Blue said he had served in the British Army in America and Europe before arriving in Australia, and that he had served during the American Revolutionary War. On 4 October 1796, Blue was convicted, at Maidstone, in Kent, of stealing raw sugar and sentenced to seven years' transportation. After serving over four years in a factory, he was transported to Botany Bay, Australia, in the convict ship . Blue arrived in Sydney in 1801 and served out the remaining two years of his sentence. In 1804, records show him living in the Rocks, then a very tough part of the city. There he met Elizabeth Williams, a 30-year-old convict from Hampshire, England, who had arrived in June 1804. On 27 April 1805, they were married at the old St. Philip's Anglican church in Sydney, where five of their six children were later christened.BILLY BLUE BORN 1760S DIED 1834 Career Blue later became a boatman, ferrying passengers across Sydney Harbour. In 1807, Blue was the only person licensed to ply a ferry across the harbour. He was also made a water bailiff and watched boat traffic on Port Jackson from a special tower. Governor Macquarie named him \\"The Old Commodore\\" and he ran his ferry dressed in a blue naval officers coat and top hat. His ferry service grew to a fleet of 11 vessels, and in 1817, Governor Macquarie granted Billy Blue at what is now Blues Point. It was said that Blue's law infringements were frequent, but due to his colourful personality, they were looked upon with a \\"benevolent air\\" by the authorities. He died in 1834 at his North Sydney home. Legacy Plaque for Billy Blue and family, St Thomas Rest Park, Crows Nest, Sydney Billy Blue's name has been preserved in place names such as Blues Point on Sydney Harbour, Blue Street and Blues Point Road in North Sydney, as well as commercial names like the Billy Blue College of Design and Blues Point Tower. His nickname 'The Old Commodore' is used in the name of the Commodore Hotel in Blues Point Road.

Several Pentecostal missionaries who had participated in the Azusa Street Revival visited Kerala from 1909 onwards. During the 1920s the missionary Robert F. Cook established the Indian branch of the Church of God, based in Kerala. Two other churches founded around this time were The Pentecostal Mission, founded in Sri Lanka by the Indian evangelist Pastor Paul, and later brought to India; and the Indian Pentecostal Church of God, set up by K.E. Abraham after he split from the church founded by Cook. A later foundation, in 1953, was the Sharon Fellowship, which runs the Sharon Women's Bible College. Many of the Pentecostal churches in India are represented in the Assemblies of God in India. 20th centuryRobert F. Cook and the Church of God= During the early 20th century the Pentecostal movement experienced rapid growth with the arrival of a number of foreign missionaries. One of the most significant among the missionaries of that period was Robert F. Cook, from the United States. Though a number of missionaries came before him and though the Pentecostal experience took place in India independent of foreign missionary work, it was Cook who first established works that began to spread into neighboring areas. He came to India in October 1913 and established a few mission posts in North India. However, due to lack of support, he was unable to develop his work in a significant manner. Cook relocated his headquarters to Mulakuzha in Kerala. The headquarters of the Church of God in India remains there now. Until 1921, Cook was stationed in Bangalore. However, in 1920, he became acquainted with Kalloor Chacko, of Thrikkannamangal, Kottarakara, and was convinced by him to relocate to Thrikkannamangal. In January 1921, he headquartered his work in a rented home adjacent to Chacko's and began his work in Kerala. He registered his churches under the name \\"Malankara Full Gospel Church of God\\". By 1922, he passed his work in Bangalore over to fellow workers and permanently moved to Thrikkannamangal. =The Pentecostal Mission= The Pentecostal Mission (TPM), formerly known as Ceylon Pentecostal Mission (CPM), is a Pentecostal denomination which originated in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka. The international headquarters is now situated in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. Ceylon Pentecostal Mission was founded in 1923 by a convert from Hinduism named Ramankutty, later known as Pastor Paul. Pastor Paul was born to Hindu parents in the district of Trichur in Kerala. While in Sri Lanka, at the age of 18, he became a Christian. Later, he began to preach and share the gospel in various parts of India and Sri Lanka. In the initial stages, he had worked with other evangelists. Pastor Paul served as the founder and chief pastor of this church. This organization stands out among the Pentecostal churches because of its exclusivist teachings and organization structure. Some of the distinctive features are that full-time workers were expected to practice an ascetic life- style including celibacy, obedience to the elder pastors, and communal living (including disposal of private possessions) in faith homes. Today the church is known by different names in different countries, but all stand under the name of “The Pentecostal Mission”. It now has churches in over 65 countries. =Indian Pentecostal Church of God= K.E. Abraham, a pastor who had worked closely with Cook for a number of years, decided that he no longer wanted the mission work taking place in India to receive foreign funds. With that as his main reason, he split from Cook and established the Indian Pentecostal Church of God (IPC) in 1924. Many others were involved in the establishment of IPC, which became largest Pentecostal Denomination in India. =Sharon Fellowship= Sharon Fellowship Church was founded in 1953 by Pastor P. J. Thomas, Pastor Thadathil George Koshy (later founder president of Faith Theological Seminary in Kerala)\\"How it all Began\\", Faith Theological Seminary and ten other members including two women. Pastor P.J. Thomas was born on 15 April 1914, the son of Pastor P.V. John. He converted to Christianity in 1936. He studied at Serampore University and earned a Diploma in Theology. He went on to attend Wheaton College (Illinois) where he received a master's degree in Comparative Religion, and taught there for a short time before returning to India in 1952. He purchased the present Sharon property in March 1953 and with the completion of the Sharon Hall, he founded Sharon Bible School and later formed Sharon Fellowship Church. He died on 24 March 1998, and was succeeded as president by Rev. Dr. T.G. Koshy. In January 2015, due to ill health, Rev. Koshy handed over the presidency to Rev. John Thomas, while remaining in his capacity as Senior General Minister. Sister Aleyamma Thomas of the Sharon Fellowship was instrumental in starting the first Women's Training Centre in India at Thiruvalla, Kerala, which is now known as Sharon Women's Bible College. The Sharon Fellowship has more than 2050 local churches in India and another 34 churches internationally, in addition to several associated Bible Schools and Seminaries. =Assemblies of God in India= The Assemblies of God in India, representing many of the Pentecostal churches in India, now has 8,000 member churches. Its governing body is the General Council of the Assemblies of God. It is a member of the World Assemblies of God Fellowship and operates an Assembly of God College in Bangalore. The district of Kerala has now been divided into two in order to better handle the growth. 8 Sothern revenue districts (Thiruvananthapuram to Thrissur) are grouped together called 'Malayalam District Council'.Rev.T J Samuel and Rev.Dr. P S Philip are serve the leadership of AG Malayalam District Council. Rev K J Mathew will be elected as the new superintendent of Assemblies of God Malayalam District Council of the SIAG. and the rest of the revenue districts (Palakkad to Kasaragod) formed 'Malabar District Council. Both these District councils are coming under the \\"South India Assemblies of God\\". The church has also established a number of Bible Schools throughout India. Pastor Sam U serves as the youth department (Christ's Ambassadors-CA) President of Malayalam District Council of Kerala. 21st century The Indian Pentecostal Church of God, The Pentecostal Mission, The Assemblies of God and Sharon Fellowship are some of the largest among the Pentecostal organizations in India. There are numerous other groups that are either independent or affiliated to the above-mentioned mainline Pentecostal groups. With strong support from churches and charities in the United States, Europe and Australia, these groups have been able to build organizations with presence in almost every state of India. Many of these groups are more charismatic in theology and often do not conform to the foundational teachings accepted by the mainline Pentecostal churches.

Born in Beaufort, Victoria, on her father's sheep property, she was educated at Ruyton Girls' School. Her sister was the artist Valma Howell. She lived in New York in the latter part of her life where she wrote most of her most famous works. Her early writing, which she later eschewed as adolescent, showed considerable skill utilising Indigenous Australian phonetic forms of her childhood in Western Victoria. She is best known for her later writing, much praised for its great formal and feminine qualities, as an early sound poet. Her most influential works include the strangely disquieting Dookerimbud, Monmot and Neemini and the later Exit Strategies. The last part of her life was apparently spent in much economic hardship and she died virtually unknown in her own country. New York life By the time she was in her late thirties Ada had abandoned Melbourne, where she was surrounded by what she felt were stuffy and provincial relations, for New York and the bohemian life, where she was soon surrounded by an artistic life and freedom she was unable to experience in Australia. Her first husband, Adrian Morten, an undistinguished writer and critic, by whom she had her two children, does not appear to have been very supportive. The marriage, like most of Ada's later relationships, floated on a tide of drink and was marked by spectacular rows. After Morten's sudden death she consoled herself with many lovers, including Christopher Isherwood, who soon fled, leaving Ada convinced he was 'a pederast at heart'(It is claimed that she was the only person to have bedded both Chester Kallman and Isherwood). However, \\"once I got Mr Morten out of my life I felt like a new woman,\\" she told a close friend Harold Norse, and in her forties she stumbled into her métier, modern poetry. In the early 1940s she was taken under the wing of Peggy Guggenheim who was to provide both financial and intellectual encouragement. In the decades that followed she became a close friend to poet and beat Harold Norse. Her last years were a slow decline due to alcoholism. Little is known of her last years and she died of unknown causes in 1981. Juvenilia Her earliest work Poems is not considered to be of much literary value, however it does display an affection for the sound of words and an awareness of other languages other than English. An example is the poem A single body of water: :In the dim light of the crescent moon, :I strode the high hills of Ercildoune. :Through the lakes and the waters' song :Soft words they whispered 'Buninyong' Early work Her professional career begins with Anamorphosis where she goes beyond the exterior world of landscape and the body and she begins to explore the interior universe of love and selfhood. The poem exhibits a new awareness of the world around her: :All the same, my desire had taught me :An object lesson. :He was a sceptic, I was an enthusiast. :He analysed, I synthesized. :He dealt with proofs, I with questions of faith. :He was, in short, :An historian. :I couldn't help being :A pilgrim; :But I knew now I must be :As dispassionate pilgrim :As possible. Concrete poetry Her best known work is the controversial Exit Strategies. This prose/poem cycle was praised by E. E. Cummings as \\"poetry as pure energy...just in time for atomic age\\", but similarly condemned by others for the same qualities. The famous 400 stanza, Eanie Meanie poem: :Eanie Meanie Minie Meanie :Mo Mo Moonie Minie :Eanie Moonie Moonie Meanie :Oonie Eanie Moonie Me :.... has few andecedents in the English language: language was to her pure sound, its meaning lost in our collective past Bibliography *Poems. by A.V.

John Sands 1886 map.from John Sands, Atlas of Australia 1886. Biodiversity Lake Cowal is situated 47 km North East of West Wyalong and is home to a variety of endangered species. Some of these species include: * Australian pillwort * Australasian bittern * Black-necked stork * Blue-billed duck * Freshwater catfish (protected) * Macquarie perch (protected) Recognition The lake is listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate in 1992 and was added to the Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia in 1998. It is listed as a Landscape Conservation Area by the National Trust of Australia.} Mineral resources and mining The area surrounding the lake is rich in minerals - especially gold - and is currently being mined by Evolution Mining. Barrick Gold sold the Cowal Mine to Evolution Mining in 2015 for US$550m. There is concern among environmental groups and the local Wiradjuri Aboriginal people that the cyanide used in the mining process prior to 2007 could lead to the contamination of the lake. The area was explored for gold in the 1980s and 1990s by North Limited, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto Group. The mine has been producing gold since 2006, and produced 238,000 ounces of gold in 2016. The resource is estimated to still contain approximately of gold. Lake Cowal Campaign and Barrick Gold The Lake Cowal Gold Mine Project plans to encompass approximately 26.50 square kilometres. One hundred and eight million tonnes of low to medium grade ore would be excavated from an open cut pit 1 km wide and 325 metres deep on the lake shore and partly within the high water level of Lake Cowal to produce an estimated 2.7 million ounces of gold.The location of the mine Cowal and gold production until December 2009.

Lake Cowal is known as the heartland of the Wiradjuri nation and is rich in artifacts. Wiradjuri elder Neville \\"Chappy\\" Williams led a campaign to save Lake Cowal and the Wiradjuri heartland. The Lake Cowal Campaign aims to prevent further gold mining by Evolution Mining in the environmentally-fragile area around Lake Cowal and to stop land degradation and possible toxicity problems from the mine and its tailing dams. The Wiradjuri people are being joined in their campaign by various Australian environmentalist groups who formed the Coalition to Protect Lake Cowal initiated by the Rainforest Information Centre and Friends of the Earth Australia. The only barrier between the lake and the open pit would be an earth wall or bund. Tailings would be stored in dams 3.5 km from the lake. Water would be supplied from a bore in the Bland Creek Paleochannel borefield, 20 km east of the mine site and will use up to 17 megalitres per day. > \\"Don't desecrate our dreaming site, don't mine our sacred site.

Life Born in Portland, Maine, he was educated at Harvard University, where he was friends with American poet, Robert Lowell. Brown dropped out of Harvard after his sophomore year to write poetry, work at Time magazine, and contributed to and became a sub-editor of The New Yorker. Charles Scribner's Sons, of New York, published, in 1941, Brown's sustained unified poem, The Poem of Bunker Hill. The 158-page poetic epic won praise for its author's literary gifts as a poet and for the timely presentation of a vital topic - young men and war. Louise Bogan, from The New Yorker, was quoted, \\"Brown...possesses one of the most unmistakable poetic gifts which have recently appeared. Such a talent is not only basically good from the beginning but exhibits, also from the first, all the signs of virtuosity.\\" Also published, early in that year, was Brown's first full-length book, The End of a Decade. From the American Revolutionary warfare of The Poem of Bunker Hill, Harry Brown went directly to modern military operations. Brown enlisted in July 1941 in the US Army Corps of Engineers where he served at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. In 1942 he joined the staff of Yank magazine. Brown wrote a column for the magazine under the nom de plume of \\"PFC Artie Greengroin\\" with a book published in 1945 of the columns under that title. Brown also wrote a play A Sound of Hunting that was produced on Broadway in 1946 starring Burt Lancaster and Frank Lovejoy. It was later filmed by Stanley Kramer under the title Eight Iron Men with a different cast of Bonar Colleano, Lee Marvin, and Arthur Franz in 1952, then was a 1961 television production with Peter Falk, Robert Lansing, and Sal Mineo directed by Seymour Robbie. Brown wrote the novel A Walk in the Sun in 1944, which was made into a film with the same name in 1945. Director Lewis Milestone asked Brown to come to Hollywood as a screenwriter where he worked on films including Sands of Iwo Jima (1949), A Place in the Sun (1951) (winning an Oscar), Eight Iron Men based on his play A Sound of Hunting, and Ocean's 11 (1960). Brown also was credited for his work on the first Ocean's 11 when it was remade in 2001. Brown and his wife moved to Mexico in the early 1960s where they lived for 15 years.

Nikolaus Esterházy de Galántha was one of the treaty's chief negotiators. History To take advantage of Ferdinand's preoccupation with the Bohemian Revolt at the beginning of the Thirty Years' War, Bethlen invaded Habsburg-controlled Royal Hungary in 1618 and fully conquered it until 1620. Although a peace was settled in January 1620 giving Bethlen 13 counties in eastern Royal Hungary, the prince resumed the war in September. Ferdinand's defeat of the Bohemians at the Battle of White Mountain in November allowed him to focus his forces on Bethlen, and the emperor was able to reconquer most of Royal Hungary by 1621. Because Bethlen did not distribute the confiscated property of Catholic noblemen to his Protestant noblemen as he had promised, they rescinded their support. These setbacks, as well as Bethlen's lack of support from the Ottoman Empire, led Bethlen and Ferdinand to seek terms in Nikolsburg. In return for Bethlen's renunciation of any claims to the throne of the Kingdom of Hungary, Ferdinand agreed to observe the conditions of the Treaty of Vienna of 1606, which had granted full freedom of worship to Protestants in Transylvania and agreed on the summoning of a general diet within six months. In addition, Bethlen secured the (purely formal) title of \\"Imperial Prince\\" (of Transylvania), seven counties around the Upper Tisza River (in present-day Slovakia, Ukraine, Hungary, and Romania), the fortresses of Tokaj, Munkács, and Ecsed, and a duchy in Silesia. The treaty gave Ferdinand peace in the east and allowed him to focus his forces on subduing the Rhenish Palatinate. The Peace of Nikolsburg was confirmed by the Treaty of Vienna in 1624 and the Third Peace of Pressburg in 1626.

It was acquired by the Southern Railway in 1974, which merged with the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1982 to form the current Norfolk Southern Railway. In May 1920, the NS leased the Durham and South Carolina Railroad, which became its Durham branch. This would be the largest the NS would become a route of . At the end of 1970, it operated of road on of track; that year it reported 710 million ton-miles of revenue freight. History The Elizabeth City and Norfolk Railroad was established January 20, 1870, and in 1881 the line opened, running south from Berkley, Virginia, across the Eastern Branch of the Elizabeth River from Norfolk, via Elizabeth City to Edenton, North Carolina. On February 1, 1883, the name was changed to the Norfolk Southern Railroad, reflecting the company's ambitions to build further. It entered receivership for the first time in 1889, and was purchased April 29 and reorganized May 1891 as the Norfolk and Southern Railroad. By that time, it had acquired trackage rights over the Norfolk and Western Railroad over the Elizabeth River into Norfolk. With the reorganization also came the acquisition of the Albemarle and Pantego Railroad in North Carolina from the John L. Roper Lumber Company, extending the line from Mackeys on the other side of the Albemarle Sound from Edenton south to Belhaven on the Pungo River, a branch of the Pamlico River. On November 1, 1899, the N&S; bought the Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Southern Railroad, running east from Norfolk to Virginia Beach on the Atlantic Ocean. An extension parallel to the oceanfront took the line north from Virginia Beach to Cape Henry in 1902, but two years later the N&S; bought the competing Chesapeake Transit Company which had a line from Norfolk to Cape Henry via the Lynnhaven Inlet area and hence to Virginia Beach, and abandoned its duplicative trackage between Cape Henry and Virginia Beach. The importance of passenger rail service to the Oceanfront area to Virginia Beach's resort growth in the late 19th and early 20th century was eclipsed only in 1922 by the construction of the paved Virginia Beach Boulevard roadway between the Oceanfront area and Norfolk. Also in 1902, the N&S; acquired the Roanoke Railroad and Lumber Company's Washington and Plymouth Railroad, running from Plymouth, North Carolina, south to Washington, built a line from Mackeys to Plymouth, and began a car ferry operation across the Albemarle Sound between Edenton and Mackeys (replaced by a bridge in 1910). The W&P; had been built by the lumber company in 1889 to narrow gauge , became a common carrier in 1901, and was converted to by the N&S; in 1904. The Raleigh and Eastern North Carolina Railroad was organized in 1903 and renamed the Raleigh and Pamlico Sound Railroad in 1905. In 1906, it built a line from the end of the N&S; at Washington south to Bridgeton, as well as a completely separated line from Raleigh east to Zebulon. On November 24, 1906, the Norfolk and Southern Railway was formed as a consolidation of the Norfolk and Southern Railroad with the Raleigh and Pamlico Sound Railroad and several other companies: *Virginia and Carolina Coast Railroad: built 1885 to 1902 from Suffolk, Virginia south to Edenton and from Beckford Junction (on the Suffolk- Edenton section) to Elizabeth City; originally built as the Suffolk and Carolina Railway and renamed in 1906). *Pamlico, Oriental and Western Railway: built 1906 from New Bern (across the Neuse River from Bridgeton) east to Bayboro, including a bridge over the Neuse River that became part of the main line. *Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad (leased September 1, 1904): built 1858 from Goldsboro southeast to Morehead City, intersecting the main line at New Bern. *Beaufort and Western Railroad: built 1905 from Morehead City east to Beaufort. Norfolk Southern Railroad passenger train crosses the Albemarle Sound trestle in 1918. The company again entered receivership in 1908, and in 1910 reorganized as the Norfolk Southern Railroad. That same year it built a long branch from Chocowinity (also known as Marsden) on the main line south of Washington west to the isolated section to Raleigh at Zebulon (that became the main line to Charlotte via Raleigh, while the old line to New Bern became a branch). Several shorter branches also opened that year - from Bayboro south to Oriental, from Pinetown on the main line east to Bishops Cross on the line to Belhaven, and from Mackeys east to Columbia (as well as a trestle across the Albemarle Sound between Mackeys and Edenton). The Egypt Railroad was chartered June 14, 1890, and opened October 15, 1891, running a short distance from Colon on the Seaboard Air Line Railroad main line west to Cumnock. It was leased to the Raleigh and Western Railway, another short line continuing west from Cumnock to Harpers Crossroads, on September 6, 1893. The company entered receivership in 1907 and operations west of Cumnock were suspended in 1908. The Egypt Railroad was reorganized April 1, 1910, as the Sanford and Troy Railroad. The Durham and Charlotte Railroad was chartered March 2, 1893, and planned to connect the two cities named with the railroad. On July 15, 1896, it bought the Glendon and Gulf Railroad, running from Gulf (west of Cumnock) southwest to Glendon. After reaching Elise (Robbins) in 1899, the Durham and Charlotte Railroad was building towards Star. The company endured several years of litigation over the right-of-way with a Wright Tramway, which was built in 1896. The tramway was removed in 1901 and the Durham and Charlotte Railroad was then built to Star by 1902. Some time after 1900 it bought the former Raleigh and Western Railway right-of-way and rebuilt the line from Cumnock to Gulf, and built an extension from Star southwest to Troy. In November 1911, the NS formed the Raleigh, Charlotte and Southern Railway (RC&S;) as a consolidation of several smaller companies; the RC&S; was merged into the NS in fall 1912. The RC&S; was made up of the Sanford and Troy Railroad, Durham and Charlotte Railroad, and the following lines: *Raleigh and Southport Railway: Raleigh south to Fayetteville. *Aberdeen and Asheboro Railroad: Aberdeen northwest to Asheboro, with a branch from Biscoe west via Troy to Mount Gilead, and several other short branches. At the time, only the Raleigh and Southport Railway connected to the other NS lines. In 1914 the NS built a line from Varina on the former R&S; southwest to Colon and from Mount Gilead west to Charlotte, giving it a continuous line, using the former S&T;, D&C; and branch of the A&A; from Colon to Mount Gilead. On May 27, 1920, the NS leased the Durham and South Carolina Railroad, giving it access to Durham. The D&SC; ran from Durham south to Bonsal on the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, and was extended to Duncan on the NS around the time the NS leased it. A Norfolk Southern work train west of Mackeys, North Carolina in 1968. Another receivership came in 1932, and in 1935 it defaulted on its lease of the Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad, which was reincorporated November 16 of that year. Many branch lines were abandoned or sold during that period, such as the local lines in Suffolk, Virginia, which were sold to the Virginian Railway in 1940. On January 21, 1942, the company was reorganized for the last time as the Norfolk Southern Railway. On January 1, 1974, the Southern Railway bought the Norfolk Southern Railway and merged it into the Carolina and Northwestern Railway, but kept the Norfolk Southern Railway name. In 1982 the Carolina and Northwestern name was brought back to free up the Norfolk Southern name for the planned merger of the Southern Railway with the Norfolk and Western Railway. The new Norfolk Southern Railway was formed in 1982. While the name had once represented simply the Virginia and North Carolina based railroad which ran south from Norfolk to Charlotte, it was now a combination of the names of the two merged Class I railroads. Norfolk Southern still owns the main line from Gulf (near Cumnock) northeast to Raleigh. The part from Gulf west to Charlotte (as well as the branch to Aberdeen) is now the Aberdeen, Carolina and Western Railway, the part from Edenton north to Norfolk is now the Chesapeake and Albemarle Railroad, and the Belhaven- Pinetown branch as well as the Plymouth-Raleigh segment is now operated by the Carolina Coastal Railway.

The word gyūtan is a combination of the Japanese word for and the English word tongue. Since gyūtan literally means \\"cow tongue,\\" the word is also used to refer to cow tongues in Japan. The custom of cooking gyūtan originated in Sendai in 1948, and is usually served with barley rice, tail soup, and pickles in the Sendai area. In other areas in Japan, gyūtan is most often served in yakiniku restaurants. Gyūtan was originally conceived to be flavored with salt, which led to gyūtan being called in many yakiniku restaurants. However, some stores now serve gyūtan with tare sauce. History Gyūtan was created when Sano Keishirō, the owner of a yakitori restaurant in Sendai, opened a new restaurant that served cow tongue dishes in 1948. This restaurant was called Tasuke (太助), and is still considered one of the best places to eat gyūtan in Sendai. Most locals falsely believe and even advertise that gyūtan started when Sano decided to use cow tongues and tails left over by occupation forces, which were stationed in Sendai after Japan was defeated in World War II. However, a simple check of the official restaurant website states that at the beginning the ingredients were retrieved by shopping trips via steam train to adjacent Yamagata Prefecture. Gyūtan was initially considered a rather unusual dish, but gradually gained popularity throughout Japan, partially because white collar workers who were transferred from Sendai spread its reputation to other cities. Gyūtan restaurants received a boost in 1991, when Japan's import quotas for beef were eliminated. In 2003, the Japanese government temporarily banned American beef imports after mad cow disease was discovered in the country. This was a devastating blow for many gyūtan restaurants. For example, 90% of the beef tongues used in gyūtan restaurants in Sendai were imported from the U.S. Additionally, some connoisseurs claim that U.S. beef contains the ideal amount of fat for gyūtan dishes and refuse to use Australian beef.

He is most famous for a series of low-budget Westerns he made in the late 1950s starring Randolph Scott. Early life Boetticher was born in Chicago. His mother died in childbirth and his father was killed in an accident shortly afterwards. He was adopted by a wealthy couple Oscar Boetticher Sr. (1867-1953) and Georgia Naas Boetticher (1888-1955) and was raised in Evansville, Indiana, along with his younger brother Henry Edward Boetticher (1924-2004). He attended Culver Military Academy where he became friends with Hal Roach Jr.. He was a star athlete at Ohio State University, until an injury ended his sports career. In 1939 he traveled to Mexico, where he learned the art of bullfighting under Don Lorenzo Garza, Fermin Espinoza and Carlos Arruza. CareerEarly films= Boetticher worked as a crew member on Of Mice and Men (1939) and A Chump at Oxford (1940). A chance encounter with Rouben Mamoulian landed him a job as technical advisor on Blood and Sand (1941). He stayed on in Hollywood working at Hal Roach Studios doing a variety of jobs. =Columbia Pictures= Boetticher received an offer to work at Columbia Pictures as an assistant director on The More the Merrier (1943). The studio liked his work and he stayed to assist on Submarine Raider (1942), The Desperadoes (1943), Destroyer (1943), U-Boat Prisoner (1944), and Cover Girl (1944), promoted to first assistant director. Some of these were Columbia's most prestigious films and Boetticher was offered the chance to join the studio's directing program. Boetticher's first credited film as director was a Boston Blackie film One Mysterious Night (1944). It was followed by other \\"B\\" movies: The Missing Juror (1944), Youth on Trial (1945), A Guy, a Gal and a Pal (1945), and Escape in the Fog (1945). \\"They were terrible pictures”, he remarked in 1979. \\"We had eight or ten days to make a picture. We had all these people who later became stars, or didn't, like George Macready and Nina Foch, and you never had anybody any good. I don't mean that they weren't good but they weren't then, and neither were we.\\" =Military service= Boetticher was commissioned as an Ensign in the Photographic Science Laboratory of the US Navy. He made documentaries and service films including The Fleet That Came to Stay (1945) and Well Done. =Eagle Lion= Boetticher left Columbia. He directed some films for Eagle Lion, Assigned to Danger (1948) and Behind Locked Doors (1949). =Monogram Pictures= At Monogram Pictures he directed Roddy McDowall in Black Midnight (1949) and Killer Shark (1950). In between he made The Wolf Hunters (1949). He began directing for television with Magnavox Theatre - a production of The Three Musketeers that was released theatrically in some markets as The Blade of the Musketeers. =Bullfighter and the Lady= Boetticher got his first big break when he was asked to direct Bullfighter and the Lady for John Wayne's production company, Batjac, based loosely on Boetticher's own adventures studying to be a matador in Mexico. It was the first film he signed as \\"Budd Boetticher\\", rather than his given name, and it earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Original Story. But the film was edited drastically without his consent, and his career again seemed on hold. (The film has since been restored by the UCLA Film Archive and the restored print is sometimes referred to by its working title, Torero.) =Universal= Boetticher signed a contract to direct for Universal Pictures where he specialised in Westerns. “I became a western director because they thought I looked like one and they thought I rode better than anyone else,\\" said Boetticher later. \\"And I didn’t know anything about the west.” His films there included The Cimarron Kid (1952) with Audie Murphy; Bronco Buster (1952); Red Ball Express (1952), a World War Two film; Horizons West (1952) with Robert Ryan; City Beneath the Sea (1953), a treasure hunting film; Seminole (1953), a Western with Rock Hudson; The Man from the Alamo (1953) with Glenn Ford; Wings of the Hawk (1953) with Van Heflin; and East of Sumatra (1953) with Chandler and Quinn. He started directing The Americano, an independent film with Ford, but quit. He returned to television with The Public Defender. =The Magnificent Matador= In 1955, he helmed another bullfighting drama, The Magnificent Matador, at 20th Century-Fox, which began his frequent collaboration with cinematographer Lucien Ballard. They followed it with a film noir, The Killer Is Loose (1956). He also directed episodes of The Count of Monte Cristo. =Ranown Cycle= Boetticher finally achieved his major breakthrough when he teamed up with actor Randolph Scott and screenwriter Burt Kennedy to make Seven Men from Now (1956). It was the first of the seven films (last in 1960) that came to be known as the Ranown Cycle. He was reunited with Scott and Kennedy on The Tall T (1957); they were joined by producer Harry Joe Brown, who would produce the six remaining films. Boetticher directed the first three episodes of the TV series Maverick. He went back to working with Scott: Decision at Sundown (1957); Buchanan Rides Alone (1958) (not written by Kennedy); and Ride Lonesome (1959). Westbound (1959) was made with Scott but without Kennedy or Brown. Comanche Station (1960) was made with Scott and Kennedy. =1960s= Boetticher returned to television, directing episodes of Hong Kong, Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre, Death Valley Days, and The Rifleman. He did a feature, The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond (1960). Boetticher spent most of the 1960s south of the border pursuing his obsession, the documentary of his friend, the bullfighter Carlos Arruza, turning down profitable Hollywood offers and suffering humiliation and despair to stay with the project, including sickness, bankruptcy and confinement in both jail and asylum (all of which is detailed in his autobiography When in Disgrace). Arruza was finally completed in 1968 and released in Mexico in 1971 and the US in 1972. =Return to Hollywood= Boetticher returned to Hollywood with the rarely seen A Time for Dying, a collaboration with Audie Murphy shot in 1969 and not released widely until 1982. He provided the story for Don Siegel's Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970). In later years he was noted for the documentary My Kingdom For... (1985) and his appearance as a judge in Robert Towne's Tequila Sunrise (1988), and he was still actively attempting to get his screenplay \\"A Horse for Mr. Barnum\\" made, before his death in 2001. He and his wife Mary spent much of their later years traveling to film festivals around the world, especially in Europe. His last public appearance, less than three months before his death, was at Cinecon, a classic film festival held in Hollywood, California.

After dalliances with 1960s soul music (Are You Passionate?) and rock opera (Greendale, which spawned a Young- directed film of the same name), Prairie Wind featured an acoustic-based sound reminiscent of his earlier commercially successful albums Harvest and Harvest Moon. The album was in part inspired by the illness and recent death of his father, Canadian sportswriter and novelist Scott Young, and the album is dedicated in part to the elder Young. Young recorded the album in Nashville before undergoing minimally invasive surgery for an aneurysm in the spring of 2005, and some of the songs on the album appear to be informed by Young confronting his own mortality. A premiere live performance of Prairie Wind was held in 18–19 August 2005 at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. Here, Young held a two-night concert where songs from the album were performed. These concerts became the subject of a film directed by Jonathan Demme entitled Heart of Gold. Young debuted the album's closing track, \\"When God Made Me\\", at the Live 8 concert in Barrie, Ontario, Canada. Commercial performance The album debuted on the Billboard 200 album chart at number 11, on October 15, 2005, with sales of approximately 72,000 copies. It remained on the chart for 26 weeks. It was awarded a certified gold record by the RIAA on January 23, 2006. Prairie Wind received two Grammy Award nominations at the 2006 Grammy Awards - Best Rock Album of the Year and Best Rock Solo Performance for \\"The Painter\\".  Critical reception  The record was regarded by Robert Christgau as \\"one of those nearness-of-death albums\\", along with Mississippi John Hurt's Last Sessions (1972), Bob Dylan's Time Out of Mind (1997), Warren Zevon's The Wind (2003), and Johnny Cash's American VI: Ain't No Grave (2010).

Today they live in the Northeastern United States and Canada, especially Delaware; in Ontario; and in Oklahoma. The Nanticoke people consisted of several tribes: The Nanticoke proper (the subject of this article), the Choptank, the Assateague, the Piscataway, and the Doeg. History The Nanticoke people may have originated in Labrador, Canada, and migrated through the Great Lakes region and the Ohio Valley to the east, along with the Shawnee and Lenape peoples. In 1608, the Nanticoke came into European contact, with the arrival of British captain John Smith. They allied with the British and traded beaver pelts with them. They were located in today's Dorchester, Somerset and Wicomico counties.Wayne E. Clark, \\"Indians in Maryland, an Overview\\", Maryland Online Encyclopedia', 2004-2005, accessed 18 Mar 2010 In 1668, the Nanticoke emperor Unnacokasimon signed a peace treaty with the proprietary government of the Province of Maryland. In 1684, the Nanticoke and English governments defined a reservation for their use, situated between Chicacoan Creek and the Nanticoke River in Maryland. Non- native peoples encroached upon their lands, so the tribe purchased a 3,000-acre tract of land in 1707 on Broad Creek in Somerset County, Maryland (now Sussex County, Delaware). In 1742, the tribe met with neighboring tribes in nearby Wimbesoccom Neck to discuss a Shawnee plot to attack the local English settlers, but the gathering was discovered and the leaders involved arrested. Some moved up to Pennsylvania in 1744, where they gained permission from the Iroquois Confederacy to settle near Wyoming, Pennsylvania and along the Juniata River. They moved upriver a decade later. They joined the Piscataway tribe, and were both under the jurisdiction of the League of the Iroquois.Pritzker 441 The reservation on Broad Creek was sold in 1768. Members of the Conoy people joined the Nanticoke in the 1740s. Together they were neutral in the French and Indian War. During the American Revolution, they allied with the British. In 1778, two hundred Nanticoke moved north to Fort Niagara because of their alliance. Later the British resettled them at the Six Nations Reserve near Brantford, Ontario, Canada, giving them land in compensation for what they had lost. Other Nanticoke stayed at Buffalo River, New York. Another group of Nanticoke joined the Lenape and migrated to Kansas; in 1867, they moved with the Lenape to Indian Territory. Name Their autonym is Nentego, which means, \\"Tidewater People.\\" The Nanticoke chiefdoms are now described as the Wicomoco, Monie and Manokin, which occupied areas along the rivers that were named after them. The Nanticoke had an extensive trading network with tribes throughout the Chesapeake Bay area. Early accounts described the Nanticoke tribes as the Arseek, Cuscarawoc, and Nause.Hodge, Frederick Webb (Editor), Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico, Part 2. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1910 Language The Nanticoke language was distinct from the Algonquian languages spoken by tribes on the Western Shore of Maryland and along the Potomac River. The Nanticoke language has since become extinct. The last speaker was Lydia E. Clark, who died in 1856.\\"History\\", Nanticoke Tribe, accessed 8 Oct 2009 Modern day Today, some Nanticoke people are part of the federally recognized Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation in Ontario, Canada.

They reorganized as the Nanticoke Indian Association and were recognized as a tribe by the state in 1881. They have their headquarters in Millsboro. In 1922 they were chartered as a non-profit organization. They organized annual powwows, carrying them on until the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression. In 1977 the tribe revived the annual event. Later they built a museum in honor of their heritage, to teach their children and other Americans.

Both tribes were historically Algonquian speaking, and there have been years of intermarriage between them.

Biography  Paul (the sixth of eleven children) and his brothers Phil and Sterl learned to play from their grandfather, Jesse R. Martin (born June 9, 1854, died January 1, 1939). Martin was discovered in 1925 by agents working for Henry Ford. Ford was unhappy with the popularity of jazz, and had started a campaign to re- popularize the dances and music of his youth. Martin visited Ford in December 1925, on the heels of the phenomenal visit of Maine fiddler Mellie Dunham. He then became a local celebrity and for the next few years played throughout western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania. In 1930 he went to live with his daughter's family, and for the next four or five years (until he went to a nursing home) he spent evenings teaching Paul his tunes and playing style. The repertoire that Paul learned from his grandfather was mostly dance music – jigs, reels, waltzes, and schottisches. He has continued to learn new tunes over the years from friends, recordings, and the radio. After Paul graduated from high school, he began training as a machinist. He married his wife, Fern, and started a family. For many years he played only rarely - just alone, for fun, and at annual Van Arsdale family reunions. He did make one appearance on a talent show on a Buffalo television station in 1950. In 1977, Paul's daughter Janet heard John McCutcheon playing a concert at the University at Buffalo. She introduced John to her father. By that time he had already appeared at the 1977 Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife and at 1976 dulcimer events like the meeting of the Original Dulcimer Players Club, in Bridgeport, Michigan. Paul's hammers follow tradition and contribute to his unique style. He uses long, flexible hammers made from ground-down hacksaw blades, with wooden blocks attached to the ends. The wooden blocks are then covered with pieces of thin glove leather. These hammers are very similar in design to the ones his grandfather used. There are two sources for transcriptions of Paul's tunes. His Dulcimer Heritage album comes with a book featuring all of the tunes on the album transcribed by Nicholas Hawes in standard notation. In addition, a collection of his tunes was published in 1987 as Tunes for the Hammered Dulcimer, As Played By Paul Van Arsdale with transcriptions by Jean Lewis. The book contains 36 tunes, including some of the ones Paul learned from his grandfather, and three of his own compositions. Jean Lewis' book has been expanded and re-issued in 2008. It now contains about 75 tunes, a biography, and notes about Paul's playing style and hammers. He died in March 2018 at the age of 97.Paul R.

As a player, Nilsson played 116 games for Sweden, making him the sixth most capped player in the Swedish national team. He also won the UEFA Cup and played in the semi-finals of the World Cup, the European Championships, and the European Cup during a playing career lasting over two decades. He won his first major honour as a manager in 2010 with Malmö FF when the team won Allsvenskan. On 1 April 2011 Copenhagen confirmed Nilsson as the club's new manager to replace Ståle Solbakken who left Copenhagen to become manager of 1. FC Köln in the summer of 2011. Nilsson joined Copenhagen on 1 June 2011 but was sacked after six months on 9 January 2012. Playing career Born in Helsingborg, Nilsson began his playing career, during which he played predominantly as a right back, as a seventeen-year-old with his hometown club Helsingborgs IF. He quickly established himself as a first-team player with Di Röe, earning himself the reputation of being one of the top youngsters in Swedish football. The quality of his performances was such that in 1983 he was signed by IFK Göteborg, who at that point were the pre-eminent team in Sweden. Despite the promise that he had shown at Helsingborg, Nilsson spent most of his first two seasons with IFK on the bench. However, he did eventually establish himself in the team, first becoming a regular starter during the 1985 season. It was during the latter end of that season that IFK began their run to the semi- final of the European Cup; IFK knocked out the likes of Fenerbahçe and Aberdeen before eventually falling to Barcelona on penalties. Nilsson missed one of the penalties in the shootout. On 1 May 1986, shortly after IFK's European Cup exit, Nilsson made his international debut. Sweden's opponents in that game were Greece, the match ended 0–0. During the year that followed he played a key role in IFK's UEFA Cup success, during which the team knocked out, amongst others, Internazionale before beating Dundee United in the final. Besides this, IFK also won the Allsvenskan in 1987. Nilsson left IFK in December 1989, joining Sheffield Wednesday of the English Football League First Division for £375,000. Despite being relegated at the end of his first season with the club, Nilsson decided to stay and helped them gain promotion at their first attempt. During the time he spent at Wednesday, Nilsson became a real favourite amongst the club's fans as his performances proved to be a catalyst for a footballing renaissance at Hillsborough. In the years that Nilsson played for the club, Wednesday won the League Cup in 1991, finished runner-up in the FA Cup and the League Cup in 1993, and played in Europe for the first time in thirty years. A number of Wednesday's fans still consider Nilsson to be the best right-back, and perhaps even the best foreigner, to ever play for the club. This was confirmed in 2007 when he came out top in a poll on Vital Football to find the club's greatest ever right-back. While playing for Sheffield Wednesday, Nilsson also took part in two international tournaments for his country. The 1990 World Cup proved to be disastrous for Sweden, who were in the same group as Brazil, Scotland, and Costa Rica; Sweden lost all three matches 2–1. However, the team bounced back in Euro 1992, which they hosted, as they reached the semi-finals. Nilsson played in all the games played by Sweden in both tournaments. In January 1994, Nilsson announced that he was suffering from homesickness and asked to be sold to a Swedish club. His manager, Trevor Francis, convinced him to remain with the club until the end of the season in return for being given an unconditional release at that time. After leaving Sheffield Wednesday, Nilsson rejoined Helsingborg. That summer Nilsson also represented his country in the World Cup, he played every second as the team finished, somewhat surprisingly, in third place. Nilsson spent the following three years playing for Helsingborg, during which time the club finished as runner-up in both the Allsvenskan and the Svenska Cupen. In 1996, he was awarded the Guldbollen, a trophy given each year to the best player from Sweden. At this point, Nilsson had planned to see out the rest of his career with his hometown club. However, in 1997 Ron Atkinson, who had signed Nilsson when he was manager at Sheffield Wednesday, made a £200,000 offer to sign him for Coventry City, an offer that Nilsson accepted. Despite being 33, Nilsson was far from being the club's oldest player; Steve Ogrizovic and Kevin Richardson were both in their late thirties, whilst Gordon Strachan was forty. The season started poorly for Coventry, a fact that saw Strachan replace Atkinson as manager in November 1997. The managerial change did little to improve matters with Coventry spending the entire season hovering around the relegation zone. On the final day of the season the team needed to beat Tottenham Hostpur in order to remain in the Premier League, a feat which the team pulled off. Nilsson spent one further season at Coventry before once again returning to Helsingborg, where he spent the following two seasons. The last international tournament in which Nilsson played was Euro 2000. He started Sweden's opening game against the co-hosts, Belgium; however, he was substituted at half-time in the game with a concussion after a defensive error, which allowed Bart Goor to put Belgium ahead, Nilsson played no further part in the tournament. Despite this snub, he played a further four games for Sweden, the last coming on 11 October 2000 against Slovakia, the result of that game, like his international debut, was 0–0. Under his managing years with GAIS, Nilsson occasionally had to make \\"comebacks\\" and play himself due to player injuries. Managerial careerCoventry City= Coventry City were relegated from the Premier League in May 2001, and following a poor start to their first season in Division One, Gordon Strachan resigned from the club. Nilsson was brought in as a player-caretaker manager, despite having no managerial experience, in place of Strachan. Following a number of wins in his caretaker role, Nilsson was given the manager's job on a permanent basis, and the club briefly topped Division One after the turn of the new year. However, Coventry City failed to live up to this early promise and the team were dogged by inconsistency for most of the season. As the Coventry fans became increasingly frustrated, Nilsson announced his retirement from playing, in order to focus on managing the club. This was not to prove successful, and, with Coventry out of the play-off chase, Nilsson was sacked in April 2002. He was replaced a week later by former team-mate Gary McAllister. =GAIS= After leaving Coventry, Nilsson briefly worked as a youth team coach at Helsingborg, before he was appointed GAIS manager on 18 December 2003. The club was promoted to Allsvenskan in 2005 for the first time in six years, after beating Landskrona BoIS 2–1 on aggregate in the promotion/relegation play-off. =Malmö FF= On 10 October 2007, Malmö FF announced that Nilsson had signed a four-year contract as manager, replacing Sören Åkeby. This proved to be a controversial move, since Malmö are the main rivals of Helsingborg and IFK Göteborg, two of Nilsson's former clubs. He enjoyed little success during his first two seasons at Malmö FF, and his side finished in mid-table positions in both 2008 and 2009. In 2010, however, he finally managed to create a winning team from the squad left by Åkeby, and the team enjoyed top league positions throughout the season finally winning the league. Nilsson managed the club for the last time in a Svenska Cupen fixture, which Malmö FF won 3–0 against Halmstad BK at Örjans Vall, Halmstad. =Copenhagen= After a long period of rumors it was announced on 1 April 2011, Nilsson would take over as manager in Copenhagen after Ståle Solbakken. Nilsson joined the club on 1 June 2011. On 9 January 2012, just six months after his recruitment, despite leading the Danish Superliga at the time, he was sacked and replaced by the sporting director Carsten V. Jensen.

Dockstader was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States. He studied painting and film while at the University of Minnesota, before moving to Hollywood in 1955, to become an apprentice film editor. He moved into work as a sound engineer in 1958, and apprenticed at Gotham Recording Studios, where he first started composing. Around this same time he also worked for Terrytoons alongside Gene Deitch. From 1961 to 1962, when Deitch directed thirteen new Tom and Jerry shorts, Dockstader was responsible for creating the unusual, heavily reverberated sound effects heard throughout them; he also wrote the shorts Mouse into Space and Landing Stripling. Dockstader's first record, Eight Electronic Pieces, was released in 1960, and was later used as the soundtrack to Federico Fellini's Fellini Satyricon (1969). He continued to create music throughout the first half of that decade, working principally with tape manipulation effects. In 1966 Owl Records released four albums of his work from this period including what many consider to be Dockstader's masterpiece, Quatermass. He achieved modest recognition and radio play alongside the likes of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Edgard Varèse, and John Cage. In 1961, he applied to use the facilities at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center and was denied access in separate rejection letters penned by Vladimir Ussachevsky and Milton Babbitt. Ussachevsky’s official reason was the “overstrained” scheduling of the studios, although many suspect that Dockstader’s lack of academic training was a factor in the decision. After leaving Gotham Recording Studios in the late 1960s he formed the audio-visual service Westport Communications Group along with business partner, and former Gotham executive, Fred Hertz. The company focused on corporate clients and produced award-winning educational films for the American Heritage series. Dockstader was also a prolific writer, with several articles published by Electronic Music Review and The Musical Quarterly. In the early 1990s, Starkland re-released most of the content of Dockstader’s out-of-print Owl records, along with previously unreleased material. The two CDs brought new, significant acclaim to the composer. The Washington Post called Dockstader \\"a highly imaginative pioneer,\\" and The Wire concluded, \\"The obsessive care with which Starkland have compiled these extraordinary recordings should ensure that Dockstader will be remembered as the innovative, visionary figure he undoubtedly was.\\" Reinvigorated, Dockstader returned to music at the start of the 21st century, adopting computer composition in favor of tapes. New CDs appeared from Sub Rosa and ReR Megacorp. Work on a documentary about his life, Unlocking Dockstader, was begun in 2011, however lack of funding has stalled the project. He died in Arlington, Massachusetts, on February 27, 2015, at the age of 82. In 2016, Starkland released From the Archives, a CD that premiered 15 works selected from the unexpected discovery of 4,200 sound files found on Dockstader's private computer after his death. Created from 2000-2008, these were among the last pieces composed by Dockstader, before dementia put an end to his studio work.

Station X is a Canadian adult animated/live-action series that aired on both the English and French channels of Teletoon in 2005. The show revolved around six young media- savvy people, in their late teens to early twenties, all living in a loft in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Station X was created by Quebec-based film producer Cité-Amérique, now part of FRV Media. Episodes were produced in English and dubbed to produce the corresponding French episodes, although text that appeared on the screen was in French, such as the election posters in \\"Power\\". Characters * Kandi: 17, blonde, fashion conscious, hypoglycemic * Davis: 22, African Canadian, works as an editor for a magazine * Knob: 20, works as sound guy for live and studio bands * Seven: of Asian-Canadian and Indian heritage * Slate: 19, a movie aficionado * Jesse: a web designer, and considered the alpha of the group Style The show's style is noted for being unique with its combination of original animation and film clips. Most clips are music videos, although other clips, such as pieces of movies or televisions shows, are also shown. Notable sources include The Kids in the Hall and Sam Roberts, and many episodes contain an Angry Kid short. The episodes had minimal plots. In each episode one character had a moral dilemma or issue, and they would discuss it with each of the other characters, each showing their point of view on the subject. A clip would then play, usually referenced to in the discussion, and occasionally directly introduced, to illustrate their point. Another unique feature of Station X is that there the screen was never filled. For each camera angle the image had a different shape and size with an edge looked rough, like torn paper. Sometimes two different angles of the same scene where shown at the same time.

Journalists may present evidence and arguments out of proportion to the actual evidence for each side, or may omit information that would establish one side's claims as baseless. False balance has been cited as a major cause of spreading misinformation. False balance can sometimes originate from similar motives as sensationalism, where producers and editors may feel that a story portrayed as a contentious debate will be more commercially successful than a more accurate account of the issue. Unlike most other media biases, false balance may stem from an attempt to avoid bias; producers and editors may confuse treating competing views fairly—i.e., in proportion to their actual merits and significance—with treating them equally, giving them equal time to present their views even when those views may be known beforehand to be based on false information. Examples of false balance in reporting on science issues include the topics of man-made versus natural climate change, the alleged relation between thiomersal and autism and evolution versus intelligent design. ExamplesClimate change= An example of false balance is the debate on global warming. Although the scientific community almost unanimously attributes global warming to the effects of the industrial revolution, there is a very small number, a few dozen scientists out of tens of thousands, who dispute the conclusion. Giving equal voice to scientists on both sides makes it seem like there is a serious disagreement within the scientific community, when in fact there is an overwhelming scientific consensus that anthropogenic global warming exists. =MMR vaccine controversy= Observers have criticized the involvement of mass media in the controversy, what is known as \\"science by press conference\\", alleging that the media provided Andrew Wakefield's study with more credibility than it deserved. A March 2007 paper in BMC Public Health by Shona Hilton, Mark Petticrew, and Kate Hunt postulated that media reports on Wakefield's study had \\"created the misleading impression that the evidence for the link with autism was as substantial as the evidence against\\". Earlier papers in Communication in Medicine and British Medical Journal concluded that media reports provided a misleading picture of the level of support for Wakefield's hypothesis.

The newspaper's chief purpose was to document local music. This focus distinguished it from other area weeklies such as the Seattle Weekly and the Willamette Week, which reported more on local news and politics. Originally solely a Seattle-based newspaper, a Portland, Oregon edition was introduced in 1991. In general, the two editions contained the same content, with some slight variations (i.e., different concert calendars) although occasionally they ran different cover stories. Publication history Bob McChesney, the paper's founder and publisher, had been active as a salesman for the Seattle Sun, a weekly alternative newspaper that competed with the Seattle Weekly. Frustrated by the paper’s refusal to cover Seattle’s then-burgeoning music-scene, the Sun’s arts editor, Robert Ferrigno, and art director, Bob Newman, started The Rocket as a companion publication to the Sun, with its first issue appearing in October 1979. By April of the following year, Ferrigno, Newman and McChesney raised enough money to produce the issues of The Rocket on their own. Ferrigno would edit the publication from 1979–1982. Published on a monthly schedule, during that period The Rocket had articles about such bands as Patti Smith, The Blackouts, The Enemy, and The Jitters. Publisher McChesney insisted that the newspaper also cover major label arena bands, and Ferrigno and his writing staff reluctantly agreed to do so, but only if they could “trash them” in the articles.Ferrigno, Robert. “Love, Rage, and Negative Macramé”, The Rocket, Issue #195, December 7–21, 1994, pg. 8 By January 1982, the paper’s circulation had grown to 50,000 copies per month. The magazine managed to attract writers and cartoonists such as Jeff Christensen, Roberta Penn, Lynda Barry, John Keister, Wes Anderson, and Charles R. Cross. The editors and writers constantly attempted to cover only “fairly obscure alternative bands” in the local area, such as The Fartz, The Allies, The Heats/The Heaters, Visible Targets, Red Dress, and The Cowboys. Publisher McChesney continued to insist that “mainstream material” be given equal time.McChesney, Robert W. “Balancing Things Left of Center”, The Rocket, Issue #195, December 7–21, 1994, pgs. 12 & 14 In 1983, Ferrigno quit the newspaper and Newman took over as editor. By the end of that year, McChesney had also left. The Rocket continued to attract new writing talent, including Daina Darzin, Craig Tomashoff, Ann Powers, Jim Emerson, Gillian G. Gaar, Brent Lorang, Grant Alden, and Dennis Eichhorn. Matt Groening provided some cover art during this period. Bruce Pavitt began a monthly column called \\"Sub Pop U.S.A.\\" devoted to the independent and underground music scene in Seattle and other parts of the U.S. Cover stars included The Young Fresh Fellows, who at the time of their Rocket feature had only performed live a dozen or so times. At the end of 1984, the newspaper printed a list of the “10 Hottest Northwest Bands”, which consisted of: Fastbacks, 54-40, D.O.A., Hosannah Choir, Girltalk, Ellipsis, Robert Cray Band, Metal Church, The Young Fresh Fellows, and The U-Men.Newman, Robert. “Mighty Cranium-Impaling Metalmesiters”, The Rocket, Issue #195, December 7–21, 1994, pgs. 22 & 24 In 1986, Charles R. Cross became the paper’s editor and remained in that capacity until The Rocket’s demise. In the mid-1980s, heavy metal music developed a strong following in the Pacific Northwest, and the paper had cover stories on such bands as Slayer, Wild Dogs, Queensrÿche, and Metal Church. By 1988, that scene had pretty much faded, and The Rocket’s editorial focus shifted to covering the pre-grunge local alternative rock bands that were even then beginning to attract national attention. Long before any other publication took notice of them, Soundgarden and Nirvana became Rocket cover stars in 1988.Anderson, Dawn. “Timeline: 1988”, The Rocket, Issue #195, December 7–21, 1994, pg. 38 In December 1989, The Rocket celebrated its tenth anniversary by hosting a “Nine for the 90’s” concert with a mix of what the paper felt were Seattle’s most promising new bands, including Love Battery, The Posies, High Performance Crew, The Walkabouts, The Young Fresh Fellows, and Alice in Chains.Gilbert, Jeff. “Mick’s Rockutz, The Central Tavern, Lots of Beer”, The Rocket, Issue #195, December 7–21, 1994, pgs. 44 & 46 In 1991, The Rocket introduced its Portland, Oregon edition, which generally simply mirrored the Seattle-version, with only the concert listing pages offering different contents. The following year, publication of the paper switched from monthly to bi-weekly frequency. Final years In 1995, Cross sold the paper to BAM Media, a San Francisco-based company that published several music-related publications. BAM utilized the profitable Rocket “to float its other papers” for years, which slowly drained The Rocket of its money while the other papers never managed to find their footing. In August 2000, BAM shut down all of its floundering projects and sold The Rocket to Dave Roberts, the publisher of Illinois Entertainer. Roberts reduced the size of the office, purchased some new computers for the staff, paid for a few promotions, and gave the appearance that he was seriously attempting to revitalize the publication. However, only a few weeks later “almost everyone's paychecks bounced”, and Roberts abruptly advised the entire staff that the magazine was shutting down immediately. No explanation was provided to any of the staff members as to the reason for the publication’s closure. The Rocket’s final issue was dated October 18, 2000.Goedde, Brian. “End of Flight, Please Disembark: R.I.P. The Rocket”, The Stranger, November 2 – 8, 2000 issue According to The Seattle Times, during its final years The Rocket's readership was stronger than ever, with circulation having reached 55,000 copies in Seattle and 36,000 in Portland. After the magazine's demise, former publisher Charles Cross stated, \\"This was not about The Rocket not being read or respected or advertised in.

Sperone Speroni degli Alvarotti (1500–1588) was an Italian Renaissance humanist, scholar and dramatist. He was one of the central members of Padua's literary academy Accademia degli Infiammati and wrote on both moral and literary matters. Biography Born April 12, 1500 in Padua, Sperone was the second child of Bernardino Speroni degli Alvarotti and Lucia Contarini. In 1518 he obtained the artibus degree from the University of Padua and joined the Guild (Sacro Collegio) of artists and physicians. He lectured on philosophy at Padua, under the Chair of Logic. He interrupted his teachings to study at Bologna under Pietro Pomponazzi but, after Pietro's death, returned to Padua where he obtained an Extraordinary Chair of Philosophy, a post he held for another three years. His literary career began with the publication of the Dialoghi (\\"Dialogues\\") at Venice (1542). Very famous and influential was his polemic with Giovan Battista Giraldi about the principles of theatre, involving Giraldi's tragedy Orbecche as well as Speroni's tragedy Canace. Between 1560 and 1564 he lived in Rome, where he became a close friend of Annibal Caro and frequented the meetings of the Accademia delle Notti Vaticane. He then returned to Padua, where he continued his literary production. When Ugo Boncompagni was made Pope Gregory XIII in 1572, Speroni returned to Rome. In 1578, he went back to Padua where he died on June 2, 1588. Works Speroni's works include: *Dialogo della retorica (1542), on rhetoric; *Dialogo delle dignità delle donne (1542), on the status of women; *Dialogo d'amore (written in 1537 and published in 1542), on the nature of love. *Dialogo delle lingue (1542), a defense of vernacular languages instead of Latin. *Canace (1546), a verse tragedy; followed by an Apologia (1550). *Discorso su Dante (1560), on the poet Dante. *Discorso su l'Eneide (1560), on Virgil's Aeneid. *Discorso sul Orlando Furioso (1560), on Ariosto's poem Orlando Furioso. *Dialogo della istoria (1560), on history. Influence His play Canace, based on a Greek legend of incestuous love, was only performed once; but was widely diffused, and (together with Giraldi's play Orbecche) led to literary debates on tragedy and theatrical morals through to the next century. Speroni's Dialogo delle lingue (1542) greatly influenced French Renaissance thinking about the French language; it formed the basis of Joachim Du Bellay's Deffense et illustration de la langue française (1549) and inspired in part the literary studies of Claude Fauchet. Speroni was a friend and supporter of Venetian-language playwright Angelo Beolco (el Ruzante). His Dialogo delle lingue was an important source for Joachim du Bellay's Défense et illustration de la langue française. ReferencesSources *Jossa, Stefano Rappresentazione e scrittura.

We were unable to enter into any contract with our parents when we were being conceived, and so the decision is entirely theirs. English models a perspective that states that parents should be like friends to us: people that we choose to have a relationship with without any obligation.

His signature Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev (Levi Yitzchok Derbarmdiger (compassionate in Yiddish) or Rosakov) (1740–1809), also known as the holy Berdichever, and the Kedushas Levi, was a Hasidic master and Jewish leader. He was the rabbi of Ryczywół, Żelechów, Pinsk and Berdychiv, for which he is best known. He was one of the main disciples of the Maggid of Mezritch, and of his disciple Rabbi Shmelke of Nikolsburg, whom he succeeded as rabbi of Ryczywół. Levi Yitzchok was known as the \\"defense attorney\\" for the Jewish people (\\"Sneiguron Shel Yisroel\\"), because he would intercede on their behalf before God. Known for his compassion for every Jew, he was one of the most beloved leaders of Eastern European Jewry. He is considered by some to be the founder of Hasidism in central Poland. And known for his fiery service of God. Today, there are several synagogues called Berditshev, of which the rabbis of some are called Berditshever Rebbes. Life Levi Yitzchak was born in the year 5500 (1740 CE) to Rabbi Meir (who was the Av Beit Din of Zamosc) and Sarah- Sasha Ruskov in Husakov. Was known in his youth as the Illui from Yaroslav. Married to Perel, the daughter of Rabbi Israel Peretz of Levertov (grandson of Rabbi Yitzchak Meir Teomim-Frenkel Rav of Zolkawa son of Rabbi Yonah Teomim- Frenkel), and when she died she was over 100 years old. After his wedding, he went to the Maggid of Mezritsch where he studied for several years. Levi Yitzchok was known to have a very close relationship with Schneur Zalman of Liadi, the first Chabad Rebbe. Rabbi Nachman of Breslov called him the Peér (glory) of Israel. Levi Yitzchok composed some popular Hasidic religious folk songs, including A Dude'le and \\"The Kaddish of Rebbe Levi Yitzchok (A din Toyre mit Gott).\\" The Yiddish prayer \\"God of Abraham\\" recited by many Jewish people at the close of the Sabbath is attributed to him. He died on the 25th of Tishrei, 5570 (October 5, 1809) and is buried in the old Jewish cemetery in Berdychiv, Ukraine, then under the control of the Russian Empire. He had three sons.

They include the grasshoppers and grasshopper-like insects, as well as other superfamilies classified with them: the ground-hoppers (Tetrigoidea) and pygmy mole crickets (Tridactyloidea). The latter should not be confused with the mole crickets (Gryllotalpidae), which belong to the other Orthopteran sub-order Ensifera. Subdivisions and their distribution The Caelifera include some 2,400 valid genera and about 12,000 known species. Many undescribed species probably exist, especially in tropical forests. The Caelifera have a predominantly tropical distribution (as with most Orthoptera) with fewer species known from temperate climate zones. Caelifera are divided into two infraorders: the more basal Tridactylidea and the Acrididea or grasshopper-like species. This latter name is derived from older sources, such as Imms,Imms AD, rev.

Like the Ensifera, Caelifera and all of its superfamilies appear to be monophyletic. The phylogeny of the Caelifera, based on mitochondrial ribosomal RNA of thirty-two taxa in six out of seven superfamilies, is shown as a cladogram. The Ensifera, Caelifera and all the superfamilies of grasshoppers except Pamphagoidea appear to be monophyletic. Fossil grasshoppers at the Royal Ontario Museum In evolutionary terms, the split between the Caelifera and the Ensifera is no more recent than the Permo-Triassic boundary; the earliest insects that are certainly Caeliferans are in the extinct families Locustopseidae and Locustavidae from the early Triassic, roughly 250 million years ago. The group diversified during the Triassic and have remained important plant-eaters from that time to now. The first modern families such as the Eumastacidae, Tetrigidae and Tridactylidae appeared in the Cretaceous, though some insects that might belong to the last two of these groups are found in the early Jurassic. Morphological classification is difficult because many taxa have converged towards a common habitat type; recent taxonomists have concentrated on the internal genitalia, especially those of the male. This information is not available from fossil specimens, and the palaentological taxonomy is founded principally on the venation of the hindwings. The Caelifera includes some 2,400 valid genera and about 11,000 known species. Many undescribed species probably exist, especially in tropical wet forests. The Caelifera have a predominantly tropical distribution with fewer species known from temperate zones, but most of the superfamilies have representatives worldwide. They are almost exclusively herbivorous and are probably the oldest living group of chewing herbivorous insects. The most diverse superfamily is the Acridoidea, with around 8,000 species. The two main families in this are the Acrididae (grasshoppers and locusts) with a worldwide distribution, and the Romaleidae (lubber grasshoppers), found chiefly in the New World. The Ommexechidae and Tristiridae are South American, and the Lentulidae, Lithidiidae and Pamphagidae are mainly African. The Pauliniids are nocturnal and can swim or skate on water, and the Lentulids are wingless. Pneumoridae are native to Africa, particularly southern Africa, and are distinguished by the inflated abdomens of the males. Economic significance and terminology A number of species, especially in the Acridoidea, are significant agricultural pests, but not all of them are locusts: a non- taxonomic term referring to species whose populations which may change morphologically when crowded and show swarming behaviour.Uvarov BP (1966) Grasshoppers & Locusts. A Handbook of General Acridology Cambridge University Press, London 1:481 pp. Examples of agricultural grasshopper pests that are not called locusts include the Senegalese grasshopper and certain species in the Pyrgomorphidae, notably the variegated grasshopper (Zonocerus variegatus).

Futa Toro (Wolof and 𞤆𞤵𞥄𞤼𞤢 𞤚𞤮𞥄𞤪𞤮; ), often simply the Futa, is a semidesert region around the middle run of the Senegal River. This region is along the border of Senegal and Mauritania. It is well watered and fertile close to the river, but the interior parts of the region away from the river is porous, dry and infertile.Fouta, Senegal, Encyclopædia Britannica This region is historically significant for the Islamic theocracies, Fulani states, jihad armies and migrants for Fouta Djallon that emerged from here. Geography The Futa Toro stretches for about 400 kilometers, but of a narrow width of up to 20 kilometers on either side of the Senegal River. The western part is called Toro, the central and eastern parts called Futa. The central portion include Bosea, Yirlabe Hebbyabe, Law and Hailabe provinces. The eastern Futa includes Ngenar and Damga provinces. The region north and east to Futa Toro is barren Sahara. Historically, each of the Futa Toro geographical provinces were fertile pockets of land due to the waalo flood plains present, and the control of this resource was driven by kin-based families. The long stretch meant the whole region was divided among many families, and the succession property rights from one generation to next led to many family disputes, political crises and conflicts. History The word Futa was a general name the Fulbe gave to any area they lived in, while Toro was the actual identity of the region for its inhabitants. The people of the kingdom spoke Pulaar, a dialect of the greater Fula languages spanning West Africa from Senegal to Cameroon. They identified themselves by the language giving rise to the name Haalpulaar'en meaning those who speak Pulaar. The Haalpulaar'en are also known as Toucouleurs (var. Tukolor), a name derived from the ancient state of Tekrur. Islam arrived in the region in its early stages. The Toucouleur people of this region converted by the 11th century.Anthony Appiah; Henry Louis Gates (2010). Encyclopedia of Africa. Oxford University Press. pp. 500–501. The region saw many Islamic powers thereafter. The state of Denanke (1495/1514-1776) saw the origin of the modern Tukolor people. Migrations of the Fulbe left states in Futa Toro and Futa Jallon to the south. The army of Futa Toro in march (1820). The rise of the Imamate of Futa Toro in 1776 sparked a series of Islamic reform movements and jihads. Small clans of educated Fula Sufi Muslims (the Torodbe) seized power in states across West Africa. In the 1780s Abdul Kader became almaami (religious leader or imam) but his forces were unable to spread revolution to the surrounding states.http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e688?_hi=3&_pos=1 The Imamate of Futa Toro later became the inspiration and the prime recruiting ground for the jihads of Toucouleur conqueror al-Hajj Umar Tall and anti- colonial rebel al-Hajj Mahmadu Lamine. Despite resistance, the Futa Toro was firmly in the hands of French Colonial forces moving from modern Senegal by 1900. Upon independence, the region's heart, the southern bank of the Senegal River was retained by Senegal. The north bank became part of Mauritania. The great modern Senegalese musician and worldbeat star Baaba Maal comes from the town of Podor in the Futa Toro.

It is located in Arapiles approximately west of the town of Natimuk and is part of the Mount Arapiles-Tooan State Park. Arapiles is a very popular destination for rock climbers due to the quantity and quality of climbs. It is one of the premier climbing sites in Australia along with the nearby Grampians. The Wotjobaluk name for the formation is Djurid.Ian Clark, 'Multiple Aboriginal placenames in western and central Victoria', in Laura Kostanski and Luise Hercus (eds), Indigenous and Minority Placenames: Australian and International Perspectives (ANU Press, 2014) 239, 240 HistoryEarly history= Map of Mount Arapiles, Victoria. The Djurid Baluk clan of the Wotjobaluk people inhabited the nearby area for thousands of years prior to the European colonisation of Australia. They used the mountain's hard sandstone for making various stone tools, and found shelter in its many gullies and small caves. Following European settlement in the mid-1840s, the Djurid Balud were displaced from the area, leading to the breaking up of the clan. The loss of the resources that the mountain provided, the ravages of European disease, and armed clashes with the settlers were all contributing factors. By the early 1870s, the last of the Djurid Balud had been relocated to mission stations. Some of their descendants still live in the area and there are also a number of archaeological sites nearby. Indeed, a survey of Mount Arapiles in 1992 located no fewer than 42 Aboriginal archaeological sites, including \\"quarries\\" for hard stone for implements, scarred trees and rock art sites. The European colonisation of Australia also brought with it many explorers to chart the continent. The first recorded ascent of Arapiles was on 23 July 1836, by the European explorer, Major Thomas Mitchell. He named the landmark after the Arapiles hills near Salamanca, Spain, where the Battle of Salamanca took place, in which Mitchell had seen action. An extract from Mitchell's diary on 22 July reads: > \\"This certainly was a remarkable portion of the earth's surface, and rather > resembled that of the moon as seen through a telescope.\\" There is a plaque commemorating his contributions to Arapiles on the aptly named \\"Plaque Rock\\", which is close to the current campgrounds. Geology Mount Arapiles is primarily composed of quartzite, a metamorphic rock that was originally quartzose conglomerate and sandstone (quartz arenite). This protolith was laid down in the earliest Devonian (approx 420 Ma) as part of a substantial fluvial system. Evidence for this deposition can be seen in the decimeter-meter scale cross stratification and lateral accretion surfaces visible in the cliffs, and the presence of many beds containing well rounded, pebble size clasts. The nearby Grampians contain some more distal facies of the same depositonal system, this is evidenced by the lesser quantity of conglomerate and smaller average grain size. Arapiles today is preserved due to a granitic intrusion that was emplaced below the sandstone and conglomerate approx 400 Ma, or 20 million years post sedimentation. This intrusion advected heat from lower in the crust, facilitating pervasive quartz cementation of the detrital grains. The granite also contained some highly siliceous fluids that were driven off as it cooled. These fluids likely also contributed to the cementation of the sediments. This process of direct heating due to magma transport is known as contact metamorphism. While the unmetamorphosed but otherwise similar sediments surrounding \\"the Mount\\" eroded away, Arapiles has been preserved as the total occulsion of pore space related to the cementation helps to limit erosion. There is a distinct red/orange tinge that is due to trace amounts of iron oxide and various other impurities. Climbing Mount Arapiles as seen from Mitre Rock. The main climbing areas are located on the left of this photo; the Pharos and the Watchtower faces are visible, while others are out of sight around the left corner. Although there are many hiking routes to the top (including one resembling a via ferrata), most ascentionists choose to free climb one of the thousands of vertical routes on the mountain. Since the advent of modern rock climbing, thousands of routes have been recorded. =History= Abseiling off the back of Muldoon, 13. The start of the climb is the large vertical crack visible to the right of the climber at the bottom. :Note: the modern history of Mount Arapiles is covered in greater detail in many of the works listed in the References section. Arapiles was first considered for climbing in a recreational manner in September 1963, when Bob and Steve Craddock travelled to Mitre Rock after seeing it in a tourist guide, and saw that their destination was dwarfed by Mount Arapiles. It was a number of weeks and visits before climbing was actually attempted at Arapiles, with the first climbs being recorded in November 1963 on what is now called \\"The Pinnacle Face\\". The pioneering group, consisting of the Craddocks, Doug Angus, Peter Jackson, and Greg Lovejoy split into two parties, with each party claiming a route on the same day. Many more climbs were put up in the following days and weeks, including the classic climb Tiptoe Ridge (5), and in 1964 Steve Craddock and his father Bob produced the first Arapiles climbing guidebook on a school duplicating machine (featuring 15 routes). March 1965 saw the establishment of two significant climbs: The Bard (12) and Watchtower Crack (16). These climbs were done on the same day and are still regarded as classic climbs, often seeing numerous ascents per day. Activity steadily increased at Arapiles and in August 1966, Mike Stone and Ian Speedie released the second guidebook, Mt Arapiles. It was the first hardcover guide in Australia and featured 108 climbs. The rest of the 1960s saw many more new routes put up of increasing difficulty, with many including numerous aid points. The focus was on \\"getting up the climb... and staying alive\\", whether free climbing or not. The early 70s saw a lull in activity at Arapiles as attention shifted to the Grampians and Mount Buffalo. Interest in Arapiles resurfaced in late 1973 with many imposing lines being climbed with a few aids. These routes brought a sense of accomplishment to the climbing community as new grades were continually being created. In 1975, American visitor \\"Hot\\" Henry Barber arrived and began freeing these routes with minimal protection. The 21-year-old made a significant impact at Arapiles, and his visit was a pivotal point in Australian climbing, as climbers worked to support the legacy of Barber by freeing their new lines instead of being content to leave in aid points. Word of Barber's achievements spread and attracted a number of new young climbers to Arapiles. This group was later given the name \\"The New Wave\\" and throughout the rest of the 70s and early 80s they were responsible for scores of routes in the grade 20–25 range. The likes of Kim Carrigan, Mike Law and Mark Moorhead helped introduce a number of 26+ climbs, though the latter two did not often grade their climbs accurately (choosing to 'undergrade' them instead). This purposeful undergrading is known as \\"sandbagging\\" and is still common in Australian climbing (some would call it tradition), though not as much as it once was. German climber Wolfgang Güllich's ascent of Punks in the Gym in April 1985 was major achievement. The route blasts up the middle of a blank, attractive orange wall and gave Arapiles (and Australia) international exposure. At the time it was graded 32 and was the hardest climb in the world, setting a new benchmark for difficulty. Following Güllich's triumph, a number of routes of similar difficulty have been put up, though none take the \\"easiest way up\\" such an impressive feature. It has a single chipped hold known as the 'birdbath hold' created by before it was against ethics. In the early 1990s the hold crumbled, and a climber added glue to it, which remains to this day.https://climbingsimon.wordpress.com/2015/05/05/punks-in-the-gym/ Arapiles is still a popular climbing destination, with some visitors staying for months at a time. The warm weather, accessibility, quantity and quality of climbs have helped to maintain the popularity of Arapiles with locals, Australians and international travellers alike. =Philosophy= Mount Arapiles is mainly regarded as a traditional climbing area – where climbers are expected to place their own protection, and remove it after climbing. The vast majority of climbs are therefore done using removable protection such as nuts, cams and RPs. Arapiles also has a number of sport climbing routes. However, there are not many sport routes easier than 23. Popular bolted routes can be found at the following areas: Dec Crag, Flight Wall and surrounds, Skyline Walls, The Bluffs, Strolling Wall, Castle Crag, The Pharos, Yesterday Gully, Doggers Gully, Poosticks Wall. Many routes at Arapiles have lower-offs, so they can be approached from above or via an easier route. There is a strong tradition dating to the '80s of bringing the route down to your level, and it is now commonplace to rap in and pre-place gear. There are many routes with a mixture of fixed and natural gear for which this approach is suitable. Chipping the rock to 'improve' holds is regarded as vandalism and is theoretically not tolerated. However, the many exceptions to this stance include routes such as: Steps Ahead, London Calling, 'Sean's route in The Bluffs', Ethiopia, Punks, Lord of the Rings, Wackford direct, Pet Abuse, Slopin' Sleazin' and Cecil B de Mille. =Climbing areas= The Organ Pipes, with climbers visible for scale. :For a more detailed treatment of this subject, refer to the works listed in the References and External Links sections. The following is a list of the more notable climbing areas at Arapiles, including examples of famous climbs. *Declaration Crag and Bushranger Bluff :Popular with beginners and school groups, due to the number of easier climbs and secluded location. *The Atridae :Home of the \\"Flight Deck\\", a collection of more difficult climbs viewable from The Pines. *The Organ Pipes :Popular with beginners, school groups and regulars; due to the plentiful classics and its proximity to the campgrounds. *Bard Buttress and Tiger Wall :Bard Buttress is a large pillar adjacent to Tiger Wall, the most dominating feature of Arapiles to the passing observer. It features many multi-pitch classics and the longest climbs at Arapiles. *The Bluffs :These two great blocks rest atop Tiger Wall and offer many classic lines that end in a satisfying peak bagging experience. *Castle Crag :A small free standing rock opposite Tiger Wall; Castle Crag is a heavily concentrated area of climbing in the grade 20–26 range. *The Pharos :Named after the Lighthouse of Alexandria, it is a large pillar of rock isolated from the main mountain. It features Punks Wall; home of Punks in the Gym (32), which at one time was considered the most difficult climb in the world; and the Back Wall, which has a small collection of difficult classics. *The Pinnacle Face :Home of the first recorded climbs at Arapiles, and also to Tiptoe Ridge (5), a classic multi- pitch adventure. *The Watchtower Faces :The left and right faces are water- streaked slabs that straddle the Watchtower itself, which is a rough buttress that has separated from the mountain proper. Watchtower Crack (16) is an imposing line that follows the crack between the Watchtower and the Right Face. *The Northern Group :There a number of notable cliffs are in this area, including Henry Bolte Wall, a sport climbing area; and Kachoong Cliffs, which features Kachoong (21), a famous overhanging roof that is made all the more popular for being one of Australia's most photogenic. *Mitre Rock :An isolated outcrop to the north of Arapiles, it has many excellent easier routes and is a popular day trip area especially on busy weekends. =Arapiles climbing guide update= Development of new routes continues today, albeit at a slow pace. An Arapiles climbing guide update was started in March 2009, which records all new or changed routes at Arapiles since the publication of the 2008 guidebook. In 2011 the guidebook was released in both smartphone and tablet format. =Bouldering= There are a number of bouldering areas sprinkled around Arapiles that cater for all abilities. Two areas that are close to camp are the Krondorf Area and the Golden Streak Area. They are often populated in the late afternoon and early evening after the day's climbing has been done. Camping Centenary Park is a camp ground on the East side of the mount. Access is from Centenary Park Road. a fee is payable. There are no powered sites, and campfires are only permitted between May and October. There is a toilet block with flush toilets.

She was previously known as Elaine Anderson during her acting career. While married to actor Zachary Scott she was also known as Elaine Scott, and after her marriage to author John Steinbeck she was known as Elaine Steinbeck. Biography Anderson was born August 14, 1914 in Austin, Texas to Waverly F. Anderson and Libbie Adeline (née Roberts). Her maternal great-grandfather was Judge John Bryant Dupuy of Erath County, Texas. On February 21, 1934, she married actor Zachary Scott whom she met while they both studied in the University of Texas at Austin theatre program. Anderson studied drama at the University of Texas, Austin. She worked with husband Zachary at the Austin Little Theatre for several years, and in the process they met several people with connections in the New York theatre. Around 1940 the Scotts moved to New York City to seek success there. Though both wished to be successful actors, Zachary had more success in that area, so Elaine began working for The Theatre Guild in New York and learned the technical aspects of theatre production. In late 1944 Elaine gave up her career to relocate to Hollywood with husband Zachary, who had signed a seven-year contract with Warner Brothers. They divorced in December, 1950. Within a week of her divorce from Zachary Scott, Elaine married John Steinbeck on December 28, 1950. They remained married until his death in December 1968.

It was hand carved by convicts in 1810, for Elizabeth Macquarie, the wife of Major-General Lachlan Macquarie, Governor of New South Wales. The peninsula itself was known to the Gadigal as Yurong Point, and is now widely known as Mrs Macquarie's Point, and is part of The Domain, near the Royal Botanic Gardens. Description Mrs Macquarie was the wife of Major-General Lachlan Macquarie, Governor of New South Wales from 1810 to 1821. Folklore has it that she used to sit on the rock and watch for ships from Great Britain sailing into the harbour. She was known to visit the area and sit enjoying the panoramic views of the harbour. Above the chair is a stone inscription referring to Mrs Macquarie's Road. That road was built between 1813 and 1818, and ran from the original Government House (now the Museum of Sydney) to Mrs Macquarie's Point. It was built on the instruction of Governor Macquarie for the benefit of his wife. There is no remaining evidence of the original road, other than a culvert over which the road ran—the Macquarie Culvert. The stone inscription reads as follows. :Be it thus Recorded that the Road :Round the inside of the Government Domain Called :Mrs. Macquarie's road :So named by the Governor on account of her having Originally :Planned it Measuring 3 Miles, and 377 Yards :Was finally Completed on the 13th Day ofJune 1816 The peninsula sits between the Garden Island peninsula to the east and Bennelong Point (where the Sydney Opera House resides) to the west.

The town was incorporated on March 18, 1887. The city was annexed into Birmingham in 1910 and is now divided into three separate neighborhoods, North Avondale, East Avondale and South Avondale. The first residents of the area were clustered around \\"King's Spring\\" on the slopes of Red Mountain, now the site of Avondale Park. There was once a small skirmish near the spring when Confederates fired on Union soldiers watering their horses. The wife of Jefferson County sheriff Abner Killough was struck in the breast by a stray shot while sitting on her porch. Her wound is believed to have been the only blood spilled in the county during the war. The park was the largest in Birmingham until Ruffner Mountain Park was dedicated. It was known for the spring-fed grotto pool, an extensive rose garden, athletic fields, a secluded pavilion called \\"The Villa\\", and a large amphitheater that hosted a spectacular pageant in celebration of Birmingham's 50th anniversary in 1931. The park was also one-time home of the Birmingham Zoo, which at the time consisted mainly of non-exotic species with the exception of \\"Miss Fancy\\", an erstwhile circus elephant purchased by the Birmingham Advertising Club as a promotional novelty and then donated to the city. The spring emerged from a cave, now sealed off and proceeded to flow through the center of Spring Street (now 41st Street), the primary commercial center of Avondale. By the early seventies Avondale Park had developed a reputation as a drug-dealing area and the vicinity entered a long period of decline. However, the park has since seen a rebirth. In 2011, the city of Birmingham undertook a $2.88 million restoration of the park. In 2013, The Forest Park South Avondale Business Association sponsored the installation of free WiFi throughout the park. Demographics Avondale was listed on the 1890 and 1900 U.S. Censuses as an incorporated town. It was annexed by the city of Birmingham in 1910 and did not appear separately on that census. In 1900, it had 1,585 males (51.8%) and 1,475 females (48.2%).http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/33405927v1ch10.pdf Photo Gallery File:Avondale Park sign.jpgAvondale Park File:Avondale Park pond.JPGAvondale Park File:Avondale Park.JPGAvondale Park File:Feeding the swans, Avondale Park, Birmingham, Ala.

Despite its classification and climbing abilities, it does not live in trees and spends almost all of its time close to ground level. It can reach up to in length, making it one of Australia's largest frogs. Coloured gold and green, the frogs are voracious eaters of insects, but will also eat larger prey, such as worms and mice. They are mainly diurnal, although this is mostly to warm in the sun. They tend to be less active in winter except in warmer or wetter periods, and breed in the warmer months. Males reach maturity after around 9 months, while for the larger females, this does not occur until they are two years old. The frogs can engage in cannibalism, and males frequently attack and injure one another if they infringe on one another's space. Many populations, particularly in the Sydney region, inhabit areas of infrequent disturbance, such as golf courses, disused industrial land, brick pits, and landfill areas. Though once one of the most common frogs in south-east Australia, the green and golden bell frog has endured major population declines, particularly in highland areas, leading to its current classification as globally vulnerable. Its numbers have continued to fall and are threatened by habitat loss and degradation, pollution, introduced species, and parasites and pathogens, including the chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. As most of the remaining populations live on private land, the logistics of the conservation effort can be complicated. Despite the situation in Australia, some frog populations have survived with more success in New Zealand and several other Pacific islands, where it has been introduced. However, even in these areas the population of green and golden bell has been rapidly declining in the past few decades. Taxonomy Profile and dorsal views of a green and golden bell frog The common name, \\"green and golden bell frog\\", was first adopted by Harold Cogger in his 1975 book Reptiles and Amphibians of Australia. Before this, its common names were \\"golden frog\\" and \\"golden tree frog\\". The green and golden bell frog has many physical and behavioural characteristics representative of ranids, hence its original classification as Rana. It has a pointy snout, long legs, and almost complete toe webbing; the tympanum is large and distinct; and the overall body shape is similar to many Rana species. Like many frogs in the genus Rana, green and golden bell frogs are mostly aquatic, and only travel over land during periods of rainfall. It was removed from the genus because of anatomical differences with the family Ranidae. The bone and cartilage structural formations of the green and golden bell frog are closest to those of species in the family Hylidae; it was therefore reclassified. Ranoidea aurea (left) was first classed as a species of the genus Rana (right). There are many physical similarities, including a pointy snout, long legs, and almost complete toe webbing. The overall body shape is similar to many Rana species. The green and golden bell frog was first described as Rana aurea by Lesson in 1827 and has changed classification many times. The specific epithet aurea derived from the Latin aureus for 'golden'. The species is now classified within the Ranoidea aurea complex, a closely related group of frogs in the genus Ranoidea.Mahony, p. 82. This complex is scattered throughout Australia: three species occur in south-east Australia, one in northern Australia, and two in Southwest Australia. The complex consists of the green and golden bell frog (R. aurea), growling grass frog (R. raniformis), yellow- spotted bell frog (R. castanea), Dahl's aquatic frog (R. dahlii), spotted- thighed frog (R. cyclorhyncha) and the motorbike frog (R. moorei). The ranges of R. raniformis and R. castanea overlap with the green and golden bell frog; this, as well as physical similarities, may make it difficult to distinguish between the species, and until 1972, R. raniformis and the green and golden bell frog were regarded as the same, when electrophoretic studies proved them to be distinct. The tablelands bell frog has not been seen since 1980 and may now be extinct, although the large yellow spots present on its thighs help distinguish it from the green and golden bell frog. The growling grass frog, which is very similar to the green and golden bell frog, can only be readily distinguished by raised bumps on the dorsal surface. It has also been proposed that some populations of R. aurea located near Ulong, New South Wales, be a separate subspecies, R. a. ulongae, but this was not accepted.Pyke and White, p. 568. Ranoidea aurea is equally and most closely related to R. castanes and R. ranaformis. A microcomplement fixation technique using serum albumins has indicated the species closest to R. aurea is R. ranifomis. Albumin immunological distance data suggest no differentiation between the two, and the green and golden bell frog evolutionally separated from the other two species about 1.1 million years ago. A 1995 study of protein variations showed four of 19 protein systems had variation and only two had differentiation. Scientists believe the different species can still hybridise, as their distribution areas still overlap, and both R. raniformis and R. aurea have been seen sharing ponds in the Gippsland area of Victoria. However, little evidence of hybridisation actually occurring has been found. Although there have been reports of frogs of mixed appearance in Gippsland, analysis of proteins and sera of the frogs showed two distinct species. Samples in other area of distribution have shown no evidence of hybridisation in spite of cohabitation.Pyke and White, p. 569. Distribution The historic (grey) and the current (black) distribution of the green and golden bell frog The distribution of R. aurea in New Zealand The green and golden bell frog is native to south-eastern Australia. Before its decline in population, its distribution ranged from Brunswick Heads, in northern New South Wales, to East Gippsland, in Victoria,Gillespie G. R. 1996. \\"Distribution, habitat and conservation status of the Green and Golden Bell Frog Litoria aurea (Lesson, 1829) (Anura: Hylidae) in Victoria.\\" Australian Zoologist 30: 199–207. and west to Bathurst, Tumut and the Australian Capital Territory.Osborne W. S., Littlejohn M. J. and Thomson S. A. 1996. \\"Former distribution and apparent disappearance of the Litoria aurea complex from the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.\\" Australian Zoologist 30: 190–198. The bell frog's current distribution now ranges from Byron Bay, in northern New South Wales, to East Gippsland, in Victoria; populations mostly occur along the coast. In New South Wales, it has declined severely in range and abundance since the 1960s, although no similar declines have been reported in Victoria. In New South Wales, it has disappeared from highland areas above , except for a population in Captains Flat. A study of populations along coastal New South Wales indicated many populations were very small, usually of fewer than 20 adults. According to a 1996 study, six populations of more than 300 frogs are known: two in the Sydney metropolitan area, two in the Shoalhaven, and two in the New South Wales mid-north coast.White A. W. and Pyke G. H. 1996. \\"Distribution and conservation status of the Green and Golden Bell Frog Litoria aurea in New South Wales.\\" Australian Zoologist 30 (2): 177–189. There are now approximately only 40 sites in total where it is found, most of which are in the Sydney area. The green and golden bell frog has disappeared from an estimated 90% of its former range. Some specimens were apparently found in Armidale, but it turned out to be a misidentification of R. castanea.Pyke and White, p. 566. The declines in Victoria have been more modest and mostly in at inland areas where habitats have disappeared.Pyke and White, p. 567. The green and golden bell frog survives in some areas of Sydney, such as the Brickpit at Sydney Olympic Park (the proposed site for the tennis courts for the 2000 Sydney Olympics). When the green and golden bell frog was found there, the tennis courts were built elsewhere, and the population has since been monitored. This frog has become an unofficial mascot for the Homebush Bay area. It has also been introduced to places in Sydney in its natural habitat, without much success. The green and golden bell frog occurs on three islands off the east coast of Australia: Kooragang and Broughton Islands off Port Stephens, and Bowen Island at Jervis Bay. It was introduced to New Zealand in the 1860s, and it is now common in the part of the North Island north of Rotorua. In most places, it is the only frog species in the vicinity. However, recent declines have been reported, suspected to be due to predatory fish. It was also introduced to the Pacific island countries of New Caledonia and Vanuatu in the 19th century, and has since become common there. No discernible variation in size or appearance in green and golden bell frogs between different geographic areas is found. Fluctuations in size and appearance between different populations are outweighed by variations within the populations themselves. Females are more likely to be found away from breeding sites, while the opposite applies for males. Metamorphlings are divided in roughly equal numbers between males and females, while juvenile frogs are observed less often than their mature counterparts, although scientists are not sure whether this is due to lower abundance or increased reclusiveness.Pyke and White, p. 579. Description A green and golden bell frog with a dark colouration The green and golden bell frog is a large, stout frog; adults range from in length; typical specimens measure . The green and golden bell frog is therefore one of the largest Australian frogs.Egerton, p. 381. Mature males are generally smaller than mature females, and the colour on their dorsal surfaces differ greatly from females. It may be almost completely green, of shades from dark pea-green to bright emerald, green with metallic, brassy, dull copper-brown, or gold markings; or almost completely bronze. Generally, females tend to have more green patches than males. During the cooler months (May–August), when the frogs are inactive, colouration may darken almost to black.Pyke and White, p. 565. They can also darken in this way by simply staying in a dark place for a few minutes, and the colour can also change during the frogs' lifetimes. A creamy-white or pale yellow stripe, bordered above with gold and below with black, extends from behind the eye, across the typically copper-coloured tympanum to the groin. This stripe rises to form a dorsolateral fold towards the groin. Another stripe of the same colour begins below the eye and continues to the shoulder. The abdomen is cream or white, and has a coarsely granular texture. The legs are green, bronze, or a combination of both, and the inside thigh and groin are blue- green. Mature males develop a yellowish colouration to the vocal sacs on their throats. The tympanum is distinct and ovular in shape, and the species has enlarged toe discs to aid in climbing. As this species is often found in water, the fingers are free from webbing, while the toes are almost completely webbed. When in breeding condition, males develop nuptial pads on their thumbs, which are used to grip females during mating. These are coloured brown during the breeding season, but are inconspicuous and paler during the rest of the year.Draft Recovery Plan for Green and Golden Bell Frog Litoria aurea (Lesson 1829), p. 29. During the breeding season, females develop a blueish hue on their feet, while males' legs turn rusty orange.Pyke and White, p. 570. Ecology and behaviour Green and golden bell frog demonstrating camouflage within reedy environments As a member of the tree frog family, the green and golden bell frog spends much time basking in the sun on vegetation, rocks, and reeds, usually near water, or hopping around between such places.Pyke and White, p. 575. Unlike most frog species, it is often active during the day. When handled, this species secretes a slimy acrid mucus,Barker, J.; Grigg, G. C.; Tyler, M. J. (1995) Surrey Beatty & Sons. A Field Guide to Australian Frogs - The Litoria aurea complex, page 99. which consists of 17 aurein peptides. Thirteen of these show broad-spectrum antibiotic and anticancer activity. The secretion makes the frog slippery and hard to grip, and is poisonous to some other species of frogs, so it is a useful defensive tool for green and golden bell frogs. Males often fight one another if they come within 1 m of each other, frequently leading to injuries.Pyke and White, p. 578. The green and golden bell frog has been detected and prefer a wide range of habitats. It is generally associated with coastal swamps, wetlands, marshes, dams, ditches, small rivers, woodlands, and forests, but populations have also been found at former industrial sites (for instance, the Brickpit). It has even been found in human vessels such as bathtubs. The requirements of its habitat have been difficult to determine, for it has been found in a wide range of water bodies except fast-flowing streams. It is most typically found in short-lived freshwater ponds that are still, shallow, unshaded, and unpolluted, and it tends to avoid waters that contain predatory fish, whether native or introduced. However, it is most often found in areas that have been affected by human habitation. The frog prefers water bodies that support emergent vegetation, such as reeds and bullrushes, for basking, and winter habitats consist of available shelters around the breeding site, which can be vegetation, rocks, rubbish, or human debris and discarded building materials. Medium to highly dense grassy habitats are usually close at hand to provide suitable terrestrial feeding grounds.Pyke and White, p. 577. It prefers waterways with a substrate of sand, rock, or clay, and can tolerate a wide range of water turbidities, pH and oxygen levels, and temperatures, although these can hamper physical growth. Although its legs provide much grip, the frog does not choose to climb trees or live up them to any significant extent. It spends most of its time within 10 cm of the ground and rarely ventures more than a metre above the ground. The green and golden bell frog also has the ability to sit still for several hours. The green and golden bell frog can travel far in a single day or night; distances of 1.0 to 1.5 km have been re bcorded. Tagging experiments have shown that some can move up to 3 km in total, and that some travel several kilometres from the closest breeding habitat. However, the species evidently tends to return to or remain at an identified site, provided the habitat stays appropriate for its needs, or else it will move away. The green and golden bell frog also favours areas with the greatest habitat complexity, and as such, this is a core component of habitat- based strategies to protect the species. In general, the frogs stay within areas of 100–700 m2 The frog is well equipped for survival on land. It can rehydrate by absorbing moisture through its ventral skin, and evaporative water loss occurs at a rate, indicative of a watertight skin. very lowPyke and White, p. 571. Some have been observed up to 400 m from the nearest body of water. During the winter months, the frog tends to be inactive, staying in one place, whereas it moves around during the warmer months to search for food and mating partners. During winter, the frog does become active for brief periods during warm or wet weather. In cold conditions, the frogs are thought to hibernate, based on observations of some being uncovered in a \\"torpid\\" state, but this has yet to be proven with rigorous physiological studies. Although the frog is active during the day, this is restricted to leaving its shelter to sunbathe. It tends to not actively feed or forage during the day, hunting insects only if they move into its vicinity. The green and golden bell frog's reproduction depends on salinity and water temperature. Salinity affects tadpoles' development and metamorphosis,Draft Recovery Plan for Green and Golden Bell Frog Litoria aurea (Lesson 1829), p. 35. and breeding is significantly slowed for ponds that measure or below. The tadpoles can tolerate salinity levels of six parts per thousand (ppt) without any apparent effects, while salinity of 8 ppt or higher decreases growth rates and increases mortality rates. On the other hand, salinity levels of at least 1–2 ppt can be beneficial to the green and golden bell frog because this kills pathogens such as the chytrid fungus. The pH of the pond is not found to affect the likelihood of the eggs to hatch for values between 4 and 10. =Diet and predators= The voracious adults have very broad diets, including insects such as crickets, larvae, mosquito wrigglers, dragonflies, earthworms, cockroaches, flies, and grasshoppers. They are also known to eat freshwater crayfish and slugs, and other frogs, even of the same species.Draft Recovery Plan for Green and Golden Bell Frog Litoria aurea (Lesson 1829), p. 27. They have a strong tendency for cannibalism, and frequently these in the same enclosure devour each other. Studies and trials in the wild have shown cannibalism also occurs in the wild. The tadpoles feed on detritus, algae, and bacteria.Draft Recovery Plan for Green and Golden Bell Frog Litoria aurea (Lesson 1829), p. 28. Tadpoles in more advanced phases of development may show a preference for vegetable matter, but also scavenge or become carnivorous on aquatic life. Captive tadpoles have eaten boiled lettuce and pet food in pellet form. If population density is high, tadpoles have cannibalised one another. In captivity the green and golden bell frog is known to feed on crickets, fruit flies, maggots, silkworms, domestic flies, beetles, mealworms, larvae, slaters, cockroaches, molluscs, plague locusts, spiders, water snails, earthworms, and mice. A case of a small tiger snake being eaten has also been reported. Captive frogs have a habit of not responding to stationary food items, which has helped to form the belief that the frog will eat most things that move. The hunting habits of the frogs change depending on their growth phase and thus physical size. Smaller, still-growing green and golden bell frogs tend to hunt small, especially flying, insects, often jumping to catch their prey. Adult frogs appear to show a distinct preference for larger, land- based insects and frogs, although they also eat aquatic prey, such as tadpoles and other aquatic organisms. Recently metamorphosed individuals have also been seen enter to shallow water to capture mosquito wrigglers. The relative proportion that various prey make up in the frog's diet is not known. In observed studies of captive frogs, they eat less in cooler periods of the year, and frogs in the wild ate less during breeding periods. Younger frogs were also seen to forage longer into the warmer months to build up food stocks than fully matured frogs. Natural predators include wading birds, such as reef egrets, white-faced herons, white ibises and swamp harriers. Other predators include snakes, skinks, red foxes, tortoises, and eels and other fish, such as redfin perch and European carp, several varieties of gudgeon, and a range of invertebrate predators, such as the large brown mantis.Pyke and White, p. 19. Predation on adult frogs has been recorded for the red-bellied black snake, tiger snake, laughing kookaburra, and sacred kingfisher; wading birds and other snakes, such as the green tree snake, are also believed to be predators of the frog. The relative magnitude of the various predatorial threats to the frog and its tadpoles is not known. Before the frog became rare, and when subsistence lifestyles were more common, it was hunted and eaten by Australian Aborigines. It was also used in dissection demonstrations in biology classes, and caught by humans for feeding pet reptiles. =Reproduction= Development of green and golden bell frog The green and golden bell frog breeds in the warmer months from October to March, although some cases have been recorded earlier at the end of winter. Reproduction appears to be influenced by geography. More southerly and highland populations appear to have a shorter window for breeding than their more northerly and lowland counterparts. The latter appear commence breeding earlier and end later than the former group. During the breeding season, males call, usually while floating in the water, but sometimes on vegetation at the side of a pond, mainly at night. They do so with a deep growl that has been described as a four-part \\"walk-walk sound\\"—likened to the sound of a motorbike changing gears. Males have been found to respond to recordings of the call, and this is why entire groups of males will then call in unison. Males are also more likely to call under certain temperature ranges, 16–23 °C for water temperature, and 14–25 °C in the air. Calling is also more likely immediately after rain has occurred. Males appear to reach maturity at around 45–50 mm, at between 9 and 12 months, and at this size begin to develop a grey to brownish yellow wash beneath the chin. This indicates the development of a vocal sac and thus an ability to commence calling behaviour. Females reach sexual maturity at two years; those smaller than 65 mm are not seen in amplexus; this length is not reached until the second season after metamorphosis. The frog is not of a type that only breeds once. Females can shed up to 26% of their weight when spawning, while males have also been seen to lose weight during breeding, because they are eating less. The weight lost during the breeding season is typically regained from January to September. Amplexus between the male and female occurs mainly in water, but sometimes at substantial distances away on dry land. Observations of breeding sites have shown the males linger around the courting area for much longer times, while females mostly stay at other places to find food before meeting the males there. During amplexus, the males grab the females near their armpits after climbing on their backs. In the wild, amplexus usually takes between 10 minutes and five days. Artificially induced amplexus in the laboratory has been observed to last 50 hours, but there have been reports of five days. Sometimes, amplexus will not result in eggs being laid. The frogs may move up to 100 m during amplexus before the female lays her eggs. During the laying of the eggs, the pair of frogs remain in amplexus and the male is assumed to fertilise the eggs with his sperm. Males are also seen to paddle their rear legs during this time, which is speculated to accelerate fertilisation. The egg-laying and fertilisation process takes around five minutes. An average of 5,000 eggs are deposited amongst aquatic vegetation in a gelatinous mass; however, a clump of 11,682 has been recorded.van de Mortel, T.F. and Goldingay, R. 1996. \\"Population assessment of the endangered Green and Golden Bell Frog Litoria aurea at Port Kembla, New South Wales.\\" Australian Zoologist. 30(4):398–404. The female moves around while depositing, leaving a trail of eggs that sometimes entangles upon itself. Initially, the mass floats, but sinks up to 12 hours after laying, or when disturbed. The eggs are distinct from those of other frog species; they are 2–2.5 mm wide upon deposition and are bicoloured, black at one end and white at the other. They immediately begin to expand, quickly reaching around 4 mm across, before sinking. When first laid, they float with the black pointing up, but after sinking, the orientation becomes disordered. Two to five days later, the tadpoles hatch out, but the process can take only a few hours on occasions. The hatching rate varies between 46 and 77%, and peaks at 22 °C. Hatching is less likely in acidic waters, although alkaline conditions do not lead to a lower rate compared to neutral conditions. Given the large number of eggs that hatch per female and given the scarcity of mature frogs, tadpole survival rates are believed to be very low. Upon hatching, the tadpoles are around 2.5–3 mm in snout–vent length (SVL) and about 5–6 mm including the tail. Tadpoles in captivity increase exponentially over time in total length; their SVL increases from about 3 to about 9 mm within five weeks, and it triples again in the next five weeks. In all, the growth rate is 0.2 mm per day in the first five weeks. The tadpoles of the green and golden bell frog are large, reaching in length, but size varies greatly and most are much shorter. The body is usually as wide across as it is deep. The fin has a yellow tinge and is considerably arched. The musculature is moderate and tapers to a fine point, as does the fin. The body wall is translucent yellow with darker areas over the abdomen. Just before its limbs form, the tadpole begins to develop the greenish colouration of the adult. Tadpoles usually swim within 30 cm of the water surface, or remain stationary at the bottom. They often move together in groups akin to schools of fish.Pyke and White, p. 574. Towards the end of the tadpole phase, hind legs appear, followed by front limbs, and the phase ends when the front limbs are developed. This normally occurs between October and April due to the breeding season, but tadpoles been observed in the wild throughout the year, suggesting some tadpoles overwinter; this has been seen to occur for captive tadpoles. The length of the tadpole stage, in the wild and in captivity, is usually between 10 and 12 weeks, but can range from five weeks to a year. The slower-growing tadpoles usually progress during winter, as there is a positive correlation between growth rates and temperatures. Variation in growth rate across pH values of 4, 7 and 9 was insignificant. In the first four weeks, there was no significant dependence of the growth rate across the 18–26 °C range, but from this point on, growth was significantly hindered at 18 °C. At the beginning of the metamorphing stage, all limbs are present and developed, along with a tail. During this phase, the tail is resorbed, and the only other visible change is the spiracle closing. Metamorphing tadpoles typically have a SVL of 22–28 mm, and will complete metamorphosis between two and 11 months, depending on the temperature of the water and available food.Daly, G. 1995. \\"Observations on the Green and Golden Bell-Frog Litoria aurea (Anura: Hylidae).\\" Herpetofauna. 25(1):2–9. The process is slowed at low temperatures,Draft Recovery Plan for Green and Golden Bell Frog Litoria aurea (Lesson 1829), p. 30. but generally takes between three and eight days after the tadpole stage is complete. Breeding occurs in a significantly higher proportion of sites where no predatory fish are present, and water bodies are ephemeral rather than permanent. Populations in Victoria, however, have been recorded as breeding in permanent ponds as readily as they do in ephemeral ponds. Metamorphs resemble the adults and average about in length. Recently metamorphosed frogs have been observed to rapidly leave the breeding site, especially when foraging habitat is nearby, and less so if food is not available away from the area. The tendency to migrate is often attributed to cannibalism practised by larger frogs on those that are still developing.Draft Recovery Plan for Green and Golden Bell Frog Litoria aurea (Lesson 1829), p. 31. After metamorphosis is complete, the frog is around the same length. The juveniles initially grow rapidly, reaching 45 mm within two months, 50–60 mm within half a year, before growth slows. months, and increase in length more slowly after that.Pyke and White, p. 572. Once sexual maturity is reached, the frogs' physical growth is very slow. Metamorphs weigh about 2 g, while the largest adults can reach 50 g. Individual frogs can vary substantially in body weight due to changes in the amount of stored fat, recent eating, and egg formation.Pyke and White, p. 573. While it is known to live 10–15 years in captivity, the frog's lifespan in the wild is not well understood. Conservation status The numbers of green and golden bell frogs are estimated to have declined by more than 30% in the past 10 years. It is listed as globally and nationally vulnerable, and as endangered under the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act, 1995. Although it is only classified as vulnerable at national level, the National Frog Action Plan classifies the green and golden bell frog as endangered. In contrast to Australia, the frogs are abundant in New Zealand and classified as feral and unprotected.Pyke and White, p. 585. Many factors are thought to be responsible for the dramatic decline of this species in Australia, including habitat fragmentation, erosion and sedimentation of soil, insecticides and fertilisers contaminating water systems, the introduction of predatory fish, and alteration of drainage regimes. Population declines are closely related to the introduction of the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), a species native to North America that was introduced to control mosquito larvae. Laboratory studies have demonstrated the eggs and tadpoles of the green and golden bell frog are extremely susceptible to predation by this fish, and in 77 of the 93 sites in New South Wales where the green and golden bell frog was known to have disappeared before 1990, eastern mosquitofish were found to be present. The frogs have been known to inhabit waters containing the fish, but breeding is rarely successful there, pointing to the fish's voracious eating of eggs and tadpoles. The fish are not yet present in eastern Victoria, where green and golden bell frog numbers have remained solid, but the fish likely will spread to rivers there, possibly inflicting heavy losses on the frogs. Other factors thought to affect this species include predation by introduced mammals, such as cats and foxes, changes to water quality at breeding sites, herbicide use,Draft Recovery Plan for Green and Golden Bell Frog Litoria aurea (Lesson 1829), p. 40. and loss of habitat through the destruction of wetlands. The amphibian chytrid fungus appears to have led to at least some of the decline in numbers, but the relative importance of the various factors is unclear.Draft Recovery Plan for Green and Golden Bell Frog Litoria aurea (Lesson 1829), pp. 37–40. The frogs may have become more susceptible to chytrid rather than the fungus being more common. The genetic pool of the frogs has been found to be relatively small, attributed to habitat destruction, which has confined the smaller groups of frogs to isolated pockets and increased the incidence of inbreeding. This has led to proposals for frog populations to be mixed by human intervention in an attempt to reduce negative genetic effects and boost survival rates.Pyke and White, p. 587.Pyke and White, p. 583. The cannibalism of the frog has been speculated to cause its decline in some areas, because the smaller tadpoles can be toxic. Other postulated causes of the decline include increased ultraviolet radiation due to the hole in the ozone layer, global warming, and increased drought. The first theory was tested and the results were inconclusive. Global warming is not thought to be a credible cause, as the extremities of the frog's range have not changed, while declines in population have occurred in both dry and wetter areas.Pyke and White, p. 582. The green and golden bell frog has been the subject of much research and monitoring, important to improving its conservation. Research focuses on the development of management measures to keep the introduced mosquitofish under control. These include poisoning the fish, but the waterways are large and trials have given mixed results. Predators of the mosquitofish have also been tried. Other strategies may allow for the development and improvement of suitable habitat, such as increasing salinity to protect against chytrid, and to increase the reproductive success of the species. Parallel to these measures, community awareness programmes have also been proposed. One difficulty in protecting the frog is that only 20% of the known populations in New South Wales since 1990 occur in conservation parks. Of the eight populations that occur in conservation parks, only five are wholly located within them and one of these is not breeding.Pyke and White, p. 586. There have been calls for legislation to be introduced to stop habitat degradation on private land to prevent detrimental effects to the frogs. Many proposed developments have been subjected to legal action to protect the habitat, and some communities have started \\"Friends of the Green and Golden Bell Frog\\" action groups.Pyke and White, p. 589. As public awareness has increased, documentary and news segments on the deteriorating situation have become more frequent and references to the frog in environmental logos and artworks have increased.Draft Recovery Plan for Green and Golden Bell Frog Litoria aurea (Lesson 1829), p. 41. The effort to increase public consciousness of the green and golden bell frog has also been aided because its colours are the same as the national colours. Restrictions on logging close to areas inhabited by the frogs have been put in place.Draft Recovery Plan for Green and Golden Bell Frog Litoria aurea (Lesson 1829), p. 33. As green and golden bell frogs are mostly observed in environments disturbed by humans, targeted environmental interference is seen as a possible means of enhancing habitats. In 1998, a captive-breeding program was set up by the herpetofauna staff at Taronga Zoo in Sydney, sponsored by the ASX Frog Focus. The purpose of the program was to help preserve declining populations of green and golden bell frogs in the Sydney region. It involved the captive breeding of wild frogs and releasing large numbers of tadpoles back into the wild, habitat restoration, and monitoring after releases. The program was initially titled \\"Frog Focus Botany\\", as Botany was the original focus site. Thousands of tadpoles were released into a site in Sir Joseph Banks Reserve and postrelease monitoring was done by the local community. It was also the first time that school students had been involved with endangered species monitoring. The program has since branched off into several other areas. Between 1998 and 2004, tadpoles were released into specially designed ponds and dams on Long Reef Golf Course at Collaroy in northern Sydney, with little success.Draft Recovery Plan for Green and Golden Bell Frog Litoria aurea (Lesson 1829), p. 34.Draft Recovery Plan for Green and Golden Bell Frog Litoria aurea (Lesson 1829), p. 42. Although green and golden bell frogs had previously been located in the area, the population had since been lost. Mature male bell frogs are occasionally found there; however, a permanent breeding population has yet to be established. An attempted reintroduction at Marrickville in inner-Sydney has failed due to chytridiomycosis. NotesReferences *Anstis, M. 2002. Tadpoles of South-eastern Australia.

When he was fourteen years old, his father inherited a home and property in nearby Clifton from a childless uncle and aunt and the family relocated there. A few years later, his parents made cash bequests for their sons, with which David took one half of his allotment and left England for the United States in about 1817, settled eventually in Franklin, Missouri, where he opened a saddlery business. In 1822, he returned to the England, took the remainder of his bequest and convinced his younger brother William Workman (1799–1876) to join him in Missouri. David ran a successful saddlery for many years, relocating to New Franklin when the original town was destroyed by flooding from the Missouri River and then to Boonville. One of David's apprentices at the saddlery in Old Franklin was Christopher \\"Kit\\" Carson, who 'ran away' to Nuevo Mexico in 1826 and became a famed scout, trapper, and explorer. David also made many trips buying and selling general merchandise to and from Mexico and other areas. In 1850, he made a trip to the California gold fields and two years later opened a store in Sacramento, California. After a fire destroyed it and seven-eighths of the town, David visited his brother, William, a successful cattle rancher at the Rancho La Puente, east of Los Angeles, and was convinced to relocate there. In 1825, David Workman married Mary Hook of Virginia, but she died in childbirth along with their child. David then married Mary's sister, Nancy (May 13, 1807 – January 30, 1888). The two had three sons: Thomas H. (1832–1863), Elijah H. (1835–1906) and William H. (1839–1918). While David was gone on long extended trips for business, Nancy raised her sons in Missouri. Upon David's return to Missouri in early 1854, however, the family prepared for the migration to California, leaving Boonville in April and arriving in northern California in the late summer, followed by travel by steamer from San Francisco to Los Angeles, where they were met by William Workman in October. David drove cattle and sheep to the gold mines for his brother and, on one of these trips in late June or early August 1855, he was killed in Stanislaus County, California, while seeking to retrieve a stray animal and falling down a steep cliff. His body was recovered by fellow Masons, who arranged for the shipment of his body to Stockton and then on to Los Angeles. In November 1855, David Workman was buried at his brother's private El Campo Santo Cemetery, now part of the Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum in City of Industry, California, twenty miles east of Los Angeles. David's widow, Nancy, and their sons, moved to Los Angeles. Thomas was killed in a steamer explosion in 1863, but Elijah and William went on to successful careers as saddlers, real estate speculators, and bankers. Both served on the Los Angeles City Council during the 1860s and 1870s. William H. Workman was Los Angeles' mayor in 1887–88, a parks commissioner in the 1890s, and treasurer from 1901 to 1907. A grandson through William, Boyle Workman, was on the city council from 1919 to 1927 and served as president of that body. He lost the 1929 mayoral campaign, but published, in 1935, a memoir, \\"The City That Grew\\" that is still read.Workman Family Papers at LMU Andrew A. Boyle Andrew A. Boyle (September 29, 1818 – February 9, 1871), for whom Boyle Heights was named, was born in Ballinrobe, Co. Mayo, Ireland. After his mother died, his father migrated to America, but was never heard from again. Andrew and his siblings followed to the United States hoping to find their father, but were unable to do so. Andrew eventually joined the Irish colony of San Patricio in the department of Mexican Texas. During the Texas Revolution of 1836, his unit (Westover's artillery of the Texas Army) was destroyed by Mexican forces and the only survivor was Boyle, because his sister had done a favor for the Mexican military commander and begged for the preservation of her brother's life. Boyle later moved to New Orleans, where he married Elizabeth Christie, the couple having one daughter, Maria Elizabeth (1847–1933). Boyle conducted business in Texas and Mexico and, returning home from one such trip, was on a ship that sank in the Gulf of Mexico. When it was reported that there were no survivors in the tragedy, Elizabeth Boyle took sick and died. Boyle left his daughter with relatives and, in 1851, migrated to Gold Rush-era San Francisco, where he ran a shoe store. He sent for young Maria and the two remained in the San Francisco Bay Area for a short while, before they moved down to Los Angeles in 1858. He acquired the \\"Paredon Blanco\\" [White Bluffs] tract east of the Los Angeles River upon arrival and maintained the successful vineyard there, as well as running a shoe store in town. He built the first brick house in the area and maintained a comfortable existence. He died at age 53, in 1871. Boyle was appointed to the Los Angeles Common Council, the governing body of the city, on September 2, 1867, and served until December 7, 1868. He was returned to the council in a special election on February 23, 1870, for a term ending December 9 of that year.Chronological Record of Los Angeles City Officials,1850-1938, compiled under direction of Municipal Reference Library, City Hall, Los Angeles (March 1938, reprinted 1966). \\"Prepared ... as a report on Project No. SA 3123-5703-6077-8121-9900 conducted under the auspices of the Works Progress Administration.\\" Next generation After Boyle's death in 1871, David Workman's son William H. Workman, who married Maria Elizabeth Boyle in October 1867, daughter of Andrew A. Boyle (September 29, 1818 – February 9, 1871). William H. Workman subdivided portions of \\"Paredon Blanco\\" and created the residential community of Boyle Heights in 1875 named after his wife. A financial downturn the following year prevented the neighborhood from growing until the famed Boom of the Eighties, which occurred during William H. Workman's term as Los Angeles mayor in 1886 and 1887. Boyle Heights was a fashionable residential area through the end of the 19th century, became a multi-ethnic enclave from the 1920s to the 1950s, and is a predominantly Latino community today. William H. Workman and Maria Elizabeth Boyle Workman's son, Boyle Workman, was twice Mayor of Los Angeles, and wrote The City That Grew, a history of Los Angeles.

The band was founded in 2002 by Norwegian vocalist Carmen Elise Espenæs and German guitarist Christian Hector. The band's name is a modified spelling of the Norwegian word midnattssol, which means 'midnight sun'.  History  Founding and Where Twilight Dwells (2002 - 2007) = Lead singer Carmen Elise Espenæs (born on September 30, 1983 in Stavanger, Norway) had some kind of musical training in her native hometown, and began singing in some local non-professional bands, with whom she began writing her first songs at the same time. In 2002, at the age of 19, Espenæs moved to Ludwigsburg, Germany and sought to develop a musical project. She stayed with her older sister Liv Kristine who, at the time, was in Theatre of Tragedy (a metal band). While Kristine was married to Alexander Krull, Espenæs collaborated frequently with their later band Leaves' Eyes. Simultaneously, Espenæs met guitarist Christian Hector and together founded Midnattsol. They intended to start working on a new project once they found like-minded musicians to join their band. The other members of the first Midnattsol lineup were three of Hector's former bandmates in Penetralia, a gothic/black metal band from Mosbach, disbanded in 2001: drummer Chris Merzinsky, keyboardist Daniel Fischer and guitarist Daniel Droste (who replaced Christian Fütterer in 2003), while the bassist Birgit Öllbrunner (ex- Commander) was added slightly later. With this formation, the band recorded a demo financed by themselves in 2003 (self-titled Midnattsol, containing two original songs) and got a record contract with Napalm Records in 2004, with which they released all their albums to date. Espenæs wrote most of the band's lyrics, and contributed to the musical composition. Their first full- length album, Where Twilight Dwells, was released on January 31, 2005 and was produced by Alexander Krull. This work contains nine previously unreleased tracks, and includes the two songs re-recorded and renamed that appear in their 2003 demo, as well as the same ghostly cover artwork by illustrator Ingo Römling. The sound is essentially symphonic metal with influences from folk metal and power metal. The band prefers to call their style \\"Nordic folk metal\\" because of the folk elements in their music and occasional Norwegian lyrics. Their lyrics are largely based on Norwegian folk tales. On December 9, 2005, ZYX Music released the split video on DVD Feuertanz Festival 2005, with Midnattdol as the first act of six German bands that performed live on that show. = Nordlys (2008 - 2010) = Their next album, Nordlys, was released on March 28, 2008. After three years of the release of their well-received debut album, Midnattsol decided change direction and to compose an album with dark atmospheres in a melodic and heavy sound, influenced more closely by traditional gothic metal. In contrast, Nordlys is little inspired by Nordic folk metal and it is less introspective that its predecessor. Particularly noteworthy is the experimentation in the soprano vocals of their lead singer Carmen Ellise Espenæs, as well as the extensive dedication in the guitar solos of Daniel Droste and Christian Hector. However, Hector (a founding member), left the group shortly after the release of the album in order to concentrate on his other band Ahab, a German funeral doom metal band founded in 2004 by Hector and Droste. Hector was briefly replaced by Fabian Pospiech in the three live performances that made Midnattsol in Europe to promote the album. The band won the \\"Best Hope\\" award at the Metal Female Voices Fest 2009 due to the majority of votes by the fans. In spring 2010 they announced their return to the studio to record their third album, with updates for fans via studio reports on YouTube posted on their official Twitter. = The Metamorphosis Melody (2011-2017) = The third album The Metamorphosis Melody was released on April 22, 2011. It was recorded with Alex Kautz as the new Midnattsol guitarist, who joined the band shortly after the release of their previous album Nordlys in 2008, replacing to Fabian Pospiech. Nevertheless Krautz did a fine job playing with the members who had been part of Midnattsol from the beginnings. Later, guitarist and composer Daniel Droste left the band after the recording sessions for the album that finished in 2010 to focus solely on his own band Abab. To replace him, joined Matthias Schuler as official member for the respective European promotional tour, made between April and October 2011. The Metamorphosis Melody goes back to its symphonic Nordic sound and includes some themes inspired by Norwegian folk tales, with soothing vocals coming from the voice of Carmen Elise Espenæs, but less operatic. After a year and a half of inactivity, in April 2013 Midnattsol was invited for second time since 2010 to the Ragnarök Festival, held in Lichtenfels, Bavaria. In June 2013 it was announced that Espenæs, with The Sins of Thy Beloved members Anders Thue and Stig Johansen, formed the band called Savn. That band released a self-titled album in 2014. Meanwhile, Midnattsol was on a long break between 2013 and 2017. = The Aftermath (2017 – present) = In March2017, guitarist Stephan Adolph joined as a new member. Adolph had already worked with Midnattsol on their debut album Where Twilight Dwells. Previously, bassist Birgit Öllbrunner, drummer Chris Merzinsky and guitarist Matthias Schuler left the band for personal reasons before the recording sessions for the new album began at the end of 2017. On December 14, 2017, it was announced that Liv Kristine had become the official second vocalist for Midnattsol, she was originally announced to be a guest on their new album but after some discussions, the band added her as a permanent member. Their fourth studio album, The Aftermath, was released on May 25, 2018. Lyrically, in comparison to all its distant predecessors, The Aftermath has much more Nordic folk influences, including gothic metal songs with a somber social content. Recently, former guitarists Daniel Droste and Christian Hector joined forces with Stephan Adolph to form Ahab. Chris Merzinsky and Birgit Öllbrunner are also playing in the thrash/groove metal band R:I:P, among other German groups.

The English army was led by the king's brother Thomas, Duke of Clarence, while the Franco-Scots were led by both John Stewart, Earl of Buchan, and Gilbert de Lafayette, the Marshal of France. English strength was 4,000 men, although only 1,500 deployed, against 5,000 French and Scots. Background In 1415 Henry V, with the intention of resuming the war, sailed from England to France with a force of about 10,500. He then pursued a highly successful military campaign, including the decisive victory at the Battle of Agincourt, and regained from the French crown much of England's previously held lands in France.Curry. Arms, Armies and Fortifications in the Hundred Years' War. pp. 44–45 The Scots had been in an alliance with France since 1295.Prestwich. The Plantagenets. pp. 304–305 In 1419 the situation in France was desperate. Normandy was lost to the English and Paris to the Burgundians. France was in a state of an ongoing civil war between the Royalist faction and the supporters of the dukes of Burgundy. In these deteriorating circumstances, the Dauphin appealed to the Scots for help. A Scottish army was assembled under the leadership of John, Earl of Buchan, and Archibald, Earl of Wigtown, and from late 1419 to 1421 the Scottish army became the mainstay of the Dauphin’s defence of the lower Loire valley.Brown. The Black Douglases: War and Lordship in Late Medieval Scotland, 1300–1455. pp. 216–218 When Henry returned to England in 1421, he left his heir presumptive, Thomas, Duke of Clarence, in charge of the remaining army. Following the King's instructions, Clarence led 4000 men in raids through the Anjou and Maine.Wagner. Encyclopedia of the Hundred Years' War. pp. 43–44 This chevauchée met with little resistance, and by Good Friday, 21 March, the English army had made camp near the little town of Vieil-Baugé. The Franco- Scots army of about 5000 also arrived in the Vieil-Baugé area to block the English army's progress. It was commanded by the Earl of Buchan and the new Marshal of France, the Sieur de Lafayette; however, the English forces were dispersed, and significantly many of the English archers had ridden off in search of plunder or forage. On Easter Saturday, one of these foraging groups captured a Scots man-at-arms who was able to provide the Duke of Clarence with intelligence, on the 5000 strong Scottish army. Clarence was keen to engage the enemy; however, he had a problem: the following day was Easter Sunday, one of the most holy days in the Christian calendar, when a battle would be unthinkable. A two-day delay was also deemed as out of the question.Neillands. The Hundred Years' War. p. 233, According to the chronicles of Walter Bower both commanders agreed to a short truce for Easter.Macdougall. An Antidote to the English p. 65 Battle Scottish forces at Baugé. There are several accounts of the Battle of Baugé; they may vary in the detail; however, most agree that principal factor in the Franco-Scottish victory was the rashness of the Duke of Clarence. It seems that Clarence did not realise how big the Franco-Scottish army was as he decided to rely on the element of surprise and attack immediately. He discounted the advice of his lieutenants, the Earl of Huntingdon and Gilbert Umfraville, to consolidate his own force and position; instead he ordered the Earl of Salisbury to round up all the archers and follow him as soon as possible. Clarence then with only about 1500 men-at-arms available, and virtually no archers, charged the Franco-Scottish lines. The Scots rallied hastily, and battle was joined at a bridge which Clarence attempted to cross. A hundred Scottish archers, under Sir Robert Stewart of Ralston, reinforced by the retinue of Hugh Kennedy, held the bridge and prevented passage long enough for the Earl of Buchan to rally the rest of his army.G. L. Harriss, ‘Thomas , duke of Clarence (1387–1421)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Sept 2010 accessed 30 May 2013 When Clarence finally forced his way across, he was confronted with the main body of the Franco-Scottish army; its men-at-arms were dismounted and were well defended by the Scottish archers. In the ensuing melée, John Carmichael of Douglasdale broke his lance unhorsing the Duke of Clarence. There are several versions of how Clarence met his death, but, according to Bower, the Scottish knight Sir John Swinton wounded the prince in his face, but it was Alexander Buchanan who is credited with killing the Duke with his mace and holding the dead Duke's coronet aloft on his lance in triumph. Another version stated that a Highland Scot, Alexander Macausland of Lennox, was responsible for Clarence's demise, whereas a French chronicler Georges Chastellain has the Duke killed by a Frenchman.See Francis M. Nichols The Battle of Bauge, and the Personages Engaged in it in John Gough Nichols ' The Herald and Genealogist, Volume 5.' pp. 340–351 for a discussion on the variation of details and sources on how Clarence met his death. Later on in the day, probably in the evening, decisive action was taken by Salisbury, who, having succeeded in rounding up the English archers, used a contingent of them to rescue what was left of the English force and retrieve some of the bodies of the fallen, including that of Clarence.Matusiak. Henry V. pp. 218–219 Aftermath However, the Scots allowed the remnant of the English army, led by Salisbury, to escape and so missed an opportunity to remove the English from France. Nevertheless, the battle did secure the reputation of the Scottish army in France. No more were the Scots dismissed as \\"wine drinkers and mutton eaters\\" by their French allies.Rogers. The Oxford Encyclopedia of Medieval Warfare. p. 134 On hearing of the Scottish victory, Pope Martin V passed comment by reiterating a common medieval saying, that \\"Verily, the Scots are well-known as an antidote to the English.\\" The Dauphin was able to exploit the victory at Baugé, by announcing his intention to invade English- held Normandy. He made Archibald Douglas, Earl of Wigtown, the count of Longueville and lord of Dun-le-roi. Sir John Stewart of Darnley received the lands of Aubigny-sur-Nere and Concressault. The Earl of Buchan was made Constable of France. In 1422 the Dauphin created the \\"hundred men-at-arms of the King's bodyguard\\", known as the \\"Hundred Lances of France\\", to supplement the 24 archers of the Garde Ecossaise. The Hundred Lances eventually became the company known as the Gendarmerie of France, who distinguished themselves at Fontenoy in 1745. John Carmichael was elected bishop of Orléans in 1426, and was one of the 6 bishops to attend the coronation of the Dauphin as Charles VII in 1429 at Rheims. Hugh Kennedy, known to the French as Canede, was granted the right to quarter his coat of arms with the fleur-de-lis of France. Meanwhile, Henry V had been busy in England with his wife Catherine of Valois. Catherine had been crowned at Westminster in late February. Soon after the queen's coronation, Henry and Catherine had set out on separate tours of England. It was while Henry was in the north of England he was informed of the disaster at Baugé and the death of his brother. He is said, by contemporaries, to have borne the news manfully. Henry V returned to France with an army of 4000–5000 men. He arrived in Calais on 10 June, before going on to Paris; he then visited Chartres and Gâtinais before returning to Paris. Several key southern towns were still loyal to the Dauphinist forces, leading Henry to decide to remove them as a factor for good. After taking the first town, he moved to lay siege to the strongly fortified dauphin-held town of Meaux. It turned out to be more difficult to overcome than first thought. The siege began about 6 October, and the town held for seven months before finally falling on 11 May 1422. Whilst on his campaign, in France, Henry V fell ill and soon died (probably of dysentery) on 31 August 1422. The war in France continued under the Duke of Bedford's generalship, and several battles were won. The English won a decisive victory at the Battle of Verneuil (17 August 1424). At the battle of Baugé, Clarence had attacked the Franco-Scots army without the support of his archers. At Verneuil the English archers fought to devastating effect. The result of the battle was to virtually destroy the Dauphin's field army. By that time James I, who had returned to Scotland, was reluctant to send more relief to the French, and Scottish expeditions in aid of France were no longer a factor in the war.Wagner. Encyclopedia of the Hundred Years' War. pp.307–308R. A. Griffiths, ‘Henry VI (1421–1471)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Sept 2010 accessed 1 June 2013 However, despite this, it is worthy of note that the alliance and friendship between the Scots and French remained strong nonetheless - a testimony to this is the fact that many Scots still joined the French army - especially, as the conflicts escalated later on. Notably, when Joan of Arc marched triumphantly with her troops after liberating the city following the Siege of Orléans on May 08, 1429, the annals of history recorded that many Scots who had fought with them were heard playing the March of Robert The Bruce during this victorious entrance. After her death, the Scots added a new name to this march: The Hymn of Joan of Arc. Today, on July 14, during the Fête nationale française (Bastille Day) celebrations in France many French military corps and Scottish pipe bands play this tune in particular memory of Saint Joan of Arc as well as to underline the contributions of the Scots for liberating France from England.

It is the geometry that results from projecting a circle of infinitesimal radius from a curved geometric model, such as a globe, onto a map. Tissot proved that the resulting diagram is an ellipse whose axes indicate the two principal directions along which scale is maximal and minimal at that point on the map. A single indicatrix describes the distortion at a single point. Because distortion varies across a map, generally Tissot's indicatrices are placed across a map to illustrate the spatial change in distortion. A common scheme places them at each intersection of displayed meridians and parallels. These schematics are important in the study of map projections, both to illustrate distortion and to provide the basis for the calculations that represent the magnitude of distortion precisely at each point. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the Tissot indicatrix and the metric tensor of the map projection coordinate conversion. Description Tissot's theory was developed in the context of cartographic analysis. Generally the geometric model represents the Earth, and comes in the form of a sphere or ellipsoid. Tissot's indicatrices illustrate linear, angular, and areal distortions of maps: *A map distorts distances (linear distortion) wherever the quotient between the lengths of an infinitesimally short line as projected onto the projection surface, and as it originally is on the Earth model, deviates from 1. The quotient is called the scale factor. Unless the projection is conformal at the point being considered, the scale factor varies by direction around the point. *A map distorts angles wherever the angles measured on the model of the Earth are not conserved in the projection. This is expressed by an ellipse of distortion which is not a circle. *A map distorts areas wherever areas measured in the model of the Earth are not conserved in the projection. This is expressed by ellipses of distortion whose areas vary across the map. In conformal maps, where each point preserves angles projected from the geometric model, the Tissot's indicatrices are all circles of size varying by location, possibly also with varying orientation (given the four circle quadrants split by meridians and parallels). In equal-area projections, where area proportions between objects are conserved, the Tissot's indicatrices all have the same area, though their shapes and orientations vary with location. In arbitrary projections, both area and shape vary across the map. { class=\\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\\" ! World maps comparing Tissot's indicatrices on some common projections - !

Segment OA is transformed in OA′, and segment OB is transformed into OB′. Linear scale is not conserved along these two directions, since OA′ is not equal to OA and OB′ is not equal to OB. Angle MOA, in the unit area circle, is transformed in angle M′OA′ in the distortion ellipse. Because M′OA′ ≠ MOA, we know that there is an angular distortion. The area of circle ABCD is, by definition, equal to 1. Because the area of ellipse A′B′ is less than 1, a distortion of area has occurred. In dealing with a Tissot indicatrix, different notions of radius come into play. The first is the infinitesimal radius of the original circle. The resulting ellipse of distortion will also have infinitesimal radius, but by the mathematics of differentials, the ratios of these infinitesimal values are finite. So, for example, if the resulting ellipse of distortion is the same size of infinitesimal as on the sphere, then its radius is considered to be 1. Lastly, the size that the indicatrix gets drawn for human inspection on the map is arbitrary. When an array of indicatrices is drawn on a map, they are all scaled by the same arbitrary amount so that their sizes are proportionally correct. Like M in the diagram, the axes from O along the parallel and along the meridian may undergo a change of length and a rotation when projecting. It is common in the literature to represent scale along the meridian as h and scale along the parallel as k, for a given point. Likewise, the angle between meridian and parallel might have changed from 90° to some other value. Indeed, unless the map is conformal, all angles except the one subtended by the semi- major axis and semi-minor axis of the ellipse might have changed. A particular angle will have changed the most, and value of that maximum change is known as the angular deformation, denoted as θ′. Generally which angle that is and how it is oriented do not figure prominently in distortion analysis. It is the value of the change that is significant. The values of h, k, and θ′ can be computed as follows. :\\\\begin{align} h &= \\\\frac{1}{R}\\\\sqrt {{{\\\\left( {\\\\frac} \\\\right)}^2} + {{\\\\left( {\\\\frac} \\\\right)}^2}}  k &= \\\\frac{1}\\\\sqrt {{{\\\\left( {\\\\frac} \\\\right)}^2} + {{\\\\left( {\\\\frac} \\\\right)}^2}}  \\\\sin \\\\theta ' &= \\\\frac{1}\\\\left( {\\\\frac\\\\frac - \\\\frac\\\\frac} \\\\right)  a' &= \\\\sqrt {{h^2} + {k^2} + 2h k\\\\sin \\\\theta '}  b' &= \\\\sqrt {{h^2} + {k^2} - 2h k\\\\sin \\\\theta '}  a &= \\\\frac{2}  b &= \\\\frac{2}  s &= h k \\\\sin \\\\theta '  \\\\omega &= 2 \\\\arcsin\\\\left(\\\\frac{b'}{a'}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} where φ and λ are latitude and longitude, x and y are projected coordinates, and R is the radius of the globe. As results, a and b represent the maximum and minimum scale factors at the point, which is the same thing as the semimajor and semiminor axes of the Tissot ellipse; s represents the amount of inflation or deflation in area (also given by a ∙ b); and ω represents the maximum angular distortion at the point. For the Mercator projection, and any other conformal projection, h = k and θ′ = 90° so that each ellipse degenerates into a circle with the radius h = k being equal to the scale factor in any direction at that point. For the sinusoidal projection, and any other equal-area projection, the semi-major axis of the ellipse is the reciprocal of the semi-minor axis so that every ellipse has the same area even though their eccentricities vary. For arbitrary projections, neither the shape nor the area of the ellipses are related to each other in general.More general example of Tissot's indicatrix: the Winkel tripel projection. An alternative derivation for numerical computation Another way to understand and derive Tissot's indicatrix is through the differential geometry of surfaces. This approach lends itself well to modern numerical methods, as the parameters of Tissot's indicatrix can be computed using singular value decomposition (SVD) and central difference approximation. =Differential distance on the ellipsoid= Let a 3D point, \\\\hat{X}, on an ellipsoid be parameterized as: : \\\\hat{X}(\\\\lambda, \\\\phi) = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} N\\\\cos{\\\\lambda}\\\\cos{\\\\phi} -N(1-e^2)\\\\sin{\\\\phi} N\\\\sin{\\\\lambda}\\\\cos{\\\\phi} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] where (\\\\lambda, \\\\phi) are longitude and latitude, respectively, and N is a function of the equatorial radius, R, and eccentricity, e: :N = \\\\frac{R}{\\\\sqrt{1-e^2 \\\\sin^2(\\\\phi)}} The element of distance on the sphere, ds is defined by the first fundamental form: : ds^2 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} d\\\\lambda & d\\\\phi \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} E & F F & G \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} d\\\\lambda d\\\\phi \\\\end{bmatrix} whose coefficients are defined as: : \\\\begin{align} &E; = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{X}}{\\\\partial \\\\lambda} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\cdot} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{X}}{\\\\partial \\\\lambda} &F; = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{X}}{\\\\partial \\\\lambda} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\cdot} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{X}}{\\\\partial \\\\phi} &G; = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{X}}{\\\\partial \\\\phi} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\cdot} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{X}}{\\\\partial \\\\phi} \\\\end{align} Computing the necessary derivatives gives: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{X}}{\\\\partial \\\\lambda} = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} -N\\\\sin{\\\\lambda} \\\\cos{\\\\phi} 0 N\\\\cos{\\\\lambda} \\\\cos{\\\\phi} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] \\\\qquad\\\\qquad \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{X}}{\\\\partial \\\\phi} = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} -M\\\\cos{\\\\lambda} \\\\sin{\\\\phi} -M\\\\cos{\\\\phi} M\\\\sin{\\\\lambda} \\\\sin{\\\\phi} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] where M is a function of the equatorial radius, R, and the ellipsoid eccentricity, e: : M = \\\\frac{R(1 - e^2)}{(1 - e^2 \\\\sin^2(\\\\phi))^\\\\frac{3}{2}} Substituting these values into the first fundamental form gives the formula for elemental distance on the ellipsoid: : ds^2 = \\\\left(N \\\\cos{\\\\phi}\\\\right)^2 d\\\\lambda^2 + M^2 d\\\\phi^2 This result relates the measure of distance on the ellipsoid surface as a function of the spherical coordinate system. =Transforming the element of distance= Recall that the purpose of Tissot's indicatrix is to relate how distances on the sphere change when mapped to a planar surface. Specifically, the desired relation is the transform \\\\mathcal{T} that relates differential distance along the bases of the spherical coordinate system to differential distance along the bases of the Cartesian coordinate system on the planar map. This can be expressed by the relation: : \\\\begin{bmatrix} dx  dy \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\begin{bmatrix} ds(\\\\lambda, 0) ds(0, \\\\phi) \\\\end{bmatrix} where ds(\\\\lambda, 0) and ds(0, \\\\phi) represent the computation of ds along the longitudinal and latitudinal axes, respectively. Computation of ds(\\\\lambda, 0) and ds(0, \\\\phi) can be performed directly from the equation above, yielding: : \\\\begin{align} &ds;(\\\\lambda, 0) = N \\\\cos(\\\\phi) d\\\\lambda  &ds;(0, \\\\phi) = M d\\\\phi \\\\end{align} For the purposes of this computation, it is useful to express this relationship as a matrix operation: : \\\\begin{bmatrix} d\\\\lambda d\\\\phi \\\\end{bmatrix} = K \\\\begin{bmatrix} ds(\\\\lambda, 0) ds(0, \\\\phi) \\\\end{bmatrix} , \\\\qquad K = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{N\\\\cos{\\\\phi}} & 0 0 & \\\\frac{1}{M} \\\\end{bmatrix} Now, in order to relate the distances on the ellipsoid surface to those on the plane, we need to relate the coordinate systems. From the chain rule, we can write: : \\\\begin{bmatrix} dx  dy \\\\end{bmatrix} = J \\\\begin{bmatrix} d\\\\lambda  d\\\\phi \\\\end{bmatrix} where J is the Jacobian matrix: : J = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial \\\\lambda} & \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial \\\\phi}  \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial \\\\lambda} & \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial \\\\phi} \\\\end{bmatrix} Plugging in the matrix expression for d\\\\lambda and d\\\\phi yields the definition of the transform \\\\mathcal{T} represented by the indicatrix: : \\\\begin{bmatrix} dx  dy \\\\end{bmatrix} = JK \\\\begin{bmatrix} ds(\\\\lambda, 0) ds(0, \\\\phi) \\\\end{bmatrix} : \\\\mathcal{T} = JK This transform \\\\mathcal{T} encapsulates the mapping from the ellipsoid surface to the plane. Expressed in this form, SVD can be used to parcel out the important components of the local transformation. =Numerical computation and SVD= In order to extract the desired distortion information, at any given location in the spherical coordinate system, the values of K can be computed directly. The Jacobian, J, can be computed analytically from the mapping function itself, but it is often simpler to numerically approximate the values at any location on the map using central differences. Once these values are computed, SVD can be applied to each transformation matrix to extract the local distortion information. Remember that, because distortion is local, every location on the map will have its own transformation. Recall the definition of SVD: : \\\\mathrm{SVD}(\\\\mathcal{T}) = U\\\\Lambda V^T It is the decomposition of the transformation, \\\\mathcal{T}, into a rotation in the source domain (i.e. the ellipsoid surface), V^T, a scaling along the basis, \\\\Lambda, and a subsequent second rotation, U. For understanding distortion, the first rotation is irrelevant, as it rotates the axes of the circle but has no bearing on the final orientation of the ellipse. The next operation, represented by the diagonal singular value matrix, scales the circle along its axes, deforming it to an ellipse. Thus, the singular values represent the scale factors along axes of the ellipse. The first singular value provides the semi-major axis, a, and the second provides the semi-minor axis, b, which are the directional scaling factors of distortion. Scale distortion can be computed as the area of the ellipse, ab, or equivalently by the determinant of \\\\mathcal{T}. Finally, the orientation of the ellipse, \\\\theta, can be extracted from the first column of U as: : \\\\theta = \\\\arctan \\\\left( \\\\frac{u_{1,0}}{u_{0,0}} \\\\right) GallerySee also *MacAdam ellipse ReferencesExternal links *Java applet with interactive projections showing Tissot's indicatrix Category:Cartography ","title":"Tissot's indicatrix"},{"id":"2721828","text":"The Distorted Music Festival was an Australian electronic music festival held at Melbourne's Brown Alley on 10 December 2005.

(1992). Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press. crime drama film and a remake of the 1950 film noir of the same name, itself an adaptation of Gerald Kersh's 1938 novel. The film stars Robert De Niro and Jessica Lange and is directed by Irwin Winkler from a script by Richard Price. Plot Harry Fabian (De Niro) is a fast-talking, two-bit New York lawyer who hangs out at a bar called Boxers, owned by Phil (Gorman) and his wife Helen (Lange). Harry has been having an affair with Helen, who dreams of setting up her own bar and leaving Phil. At the bar, he spots an article in the New York Post about a man who was pummeled by a boxer. He calls the man on Phil's phone and pitches a lawsuit against the boxer on the grounds that his fists are legally considered weapons. The fighter is promoted by Ira \\"Boom Boom\\" Grossman (King), who tries to muscle Harry off the idea of suing his boxer. The case is promptly dismissed by the judge, who knows that it is baseless. Having seen the world of boxing up close, Harry decides to become a boxing promoter and files for a license. He recruits Boom Boom's estranged brother, former professional prizefighter Al Grossman (Warden), to be his partner. Boom Boom tries to muscle Harry out of the fight business, but when Al protects Harry, Boom Boom cowers in fear. Al asks Phil for a $15,000 loan to cover the cost of the fight. Sensing her opportunity, Helen stages an argument with Harry and demands that he come up with $7,500, promising that Phil will match the amount. Helen fronts Harry the $7,500 herself, allowing Harry to secure the loan. Phil promises that he will pay Harry the money the day before the fight. She gives him another $5,000 to help her set up her own bar by procuring a liquor license. Harry has a friend in the Federal Liquor Administration who supplies him a blank license but asks $7500 for it; because Harry only has $5000, he has to have a printer put in the printed details, making the license essentially a fake. he gives Helen the licence but doesn't tell her all the details of how he got it. Boom Boom tries one last time to persuade Harry to abandon the idea, offering him money to walk away from the fight business. Harry explains that he has spent his career in pursuit of quick and easy cases that can be settled for small cash amounts. He tells Boom Boom that he had a case once where the NYPD had mistakenly beaten up some people because they served a warrant on the wrong house. Instead of taking them to trial, he accepted the NYPD's offer of $20,000 to make the case go away. He insists that, for once, he is not going to take the money and run. Boom Boom threatens to kill Harry if anything happens to Al, who has already had two heart attacks. After a nasty fight at Boxers, Helen finally leaves Phil. Still set on keeping Harry out of promoting, Boom Boom meets with Phil and reveals that Helen has been sleeping with Harry. Enraged, Phil calls the state liquor authority to inform them that Harry had forged Helen's license. He pretends like everything is fine with Harry, and offers to throw a dinner party the night before the fight. After the party, he tells Harry that he will have the $7,500 the next day, which is the morning of the fight. Helen wakes up Harry at his place, and they talk about their new endeavors. Her new bar is opening the night of his fight. Harry goes to Boxers and anxiously waits for Phil. When Phil arrives, Harry asks him for the money. Phil says he thought Harry was joking, and then he reveals that he knows about his affair with Helen, as he beats up Harry. Desperate to keep the fight afloat, Harry borrows $12,000 from the ruthless loan shark Mr. Peck (Wallach). At the venue, Al gets into a fight with one of the staff and has a fatal heart attack. With the fight off, Harry goes to Helen's new bar only to find that it has been shut down because of his forged license. Boom Boom's goons show up to make good on his threat. Harry and Helen run and end up cornered in an alley. Harry tries to talk his way out of what is coming by explaining that the goons should be after the guy who fought with Al and caused his heart attack. He throws Peck's $12,000 in the air as the final exclamation point on his speech and walks Helen past the goons, asking her under his breath, \\"How'd I do?\\" The goons shoot Harry in the back and throw their pistols in a dumpster. The film ends with Helen holding Harry's hand as he is put in an ambulance, still talking optimistically about the future.

But it is also saddled with overly busy direction that sometimes interferes with the dialogue, making Mr. Price's long, perversely elegant conversational riffs hard to hear.\\" Writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe began his review, \\"There are few finer pleasures than watching Robert De Niro when he's on.

Roger Ebert disagreed, dismissing De Niro's work as \\"more like a riff on Rupert Pupkin, the goofy talk show fan he played in Scorsese's The King of Comedy\\".Ebert, Roger. \\"Night and the City\\", October 23, 1992. Ebert and Howe both agreed, however, that Alan King's performance was fantastic. Owen Gleiberman concurred in his review, but he sided with Ebert regarding De Niro, concluding, \\"the actor who once seemed the heir to Brando, Clift, and, yes, Widmark — the actor who once got so far inside his roles that he just about detonated the screen — now plays characters who don't seem to have any inner life at all.\\"Gleiberman, Owen.

The road was once a section of State Road 21 in 1915, which later became State Road 14 in 1923 and (PSH 14) in 1937 and in 1955. PSH 21 became SR 106 in 1964 and since, the Washington State Department of Transportation has arranged and completed minor projects to improve the roadway. Route description State Route 106 (SR 106) begins at a 3-way junction with (US 101) in the census-designated place (CDP) of Skokomish, located north of Shelton. From the intersection, the road travels southeast to bridge Skobob Creek and curve north along the Skokomish River and Annas Bay to the community of Union. After passing Union, the highway continues along the southern shoreline of Hood Canal past Twanoh State Park to intersect south of Belfair. The roadway approaching the SR 3 intersection near Belfair was used by 6,100 motorists daily in 2007 based on average annual daily traffic (AADT) data collected by the Washington State Department of Transportation; AADT data from 1970 shows that 2,000 motorists used the same section of SR 106 daily. History The first state-maintained highway on the current route of SR 106 was State Road 21, established in 1915 by the Washington State Legislature and Department of Highways and ran from Skokomish to Kingston. State Road 21 later became State Road 14, named the Navy Yard Highway, in a 1923 renumbering. During the creation of the Primary and secondary highways, State Road 14 became (PSH 14) in 1937. The Skokomish–Gorst section of PSH 14 was later added to in 1955. The 1964 highway renumbering divided PSH 21 into SR 106, and . Recently, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has arranged and completed some minor construction projects along the SR 106 corridor. The first project replaced a culvert over Skobob Creek with a bridge; the project was completed in December 2005 and was located east of Skokomish. Later in 2007, WSDOT installed a traffic signal at the SR 106 / SR 3 intersection south of Belfair. The signal was tested on May 11 and the project concluded in July.

He studied architecture and was living in Lwów at the outbreak of World War II. He survived the Janowska concentration camp (late 1941 to September 1944), the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp (September to October 1944), the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, a death march to Chemnitz, Buchenwald, and the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp (February to 5 May 1945). After the war, Wiesenthal dedicated his life to tracking down and gathering information on fugitive Nazi war criminals so that they could be brought to trial. In 1947, he co-founded the Jewish Historical Documentation Centre in Linz, Austria, where he and others gathered information for future war crime trials and aided refugees in their search for lost relatives. He opened the Documentation Centre of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime in Vienna in 1961 and continued to try to locate missing Nazi war criminals. He played a small role in locating Adolf Eichmann, who was captured in Buenos Aires in 1960, and worked closely with the Austrian justice ministry to prepare a dossier on Franz Stangl, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1971. In the 1970s and 1980s, Wiesenthal was involved in two high-profile events involving Austrian politicians. Shortly after Bruno Kreisky was inaugurated as Austrian chancellor in April 1970, Wiesenthal pointed out to the press that four of his new cabinet appointees had been members of the Nazi Party. Kreisky, angry, called Wiesenthal a \\"Jewish fascist\\", likened his organisation to the Mafia, and accused him of collaborating with the Nazis. Wiesenthal successfully sued for libel, the suit ending in 1989. In 1986, Wiesenthal was involved in the case of Kurt Waldheim, whose service in the Wehrmacht and probable knowledge of the Holocaust were revealed in the lead-up to the 1986 Austrian presidential elections. Wiesenthal, embarrassed that he had previously cleared Waldheim of any wrongdoing, suffered much negative publicity as a result of this event. With a reputation as a storyteller, Wiesenthal was the author of several memoirs containing tales that are only loosely based on actual events. In particular, he exaggerated his role in the capture of Eichmann in 1960. Wiesenthal died in his sleep at age 96 in Vienna on 20 September 2005 and was buried in the city of Herzliya in Israel. The Simon Wiesenthal Center, headquartered in Los Angeles, is named in his honor. Early life Simon Wiesenthal (circa 1940–1945) Wiesenthal was born on 31 December 1908, in Buczacz (Buchach), Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, then part of Austria- Hungary, now Ternopil Oblast, in Ukraine. His father, Asher Wiesenthal, was a wholesaler who had emigrated from the Russian Empire in 1905 to escape the frequent pogroms against Jews. A reservist in the Austro-Hungarian Army, Asher was called to active duty in 1914 at the start of World War I. He died in combat on the Eastern Front in 1915. The remainder of the family—Simon, his younger brother Hillel, and his mother Rosa—fled to Vienna as the Russian army took control of Galicia. The two boys attended a German-language Jewish school. The family returned to Buczacz in 1917 after the Russians retreated. The area changed hands several more times before the war ended in November 1918. Wiesenthal and his brother attended high school at the Humanistic Gymnasium in Buchach, where classes were taught in Polish. There Simon met his future wife, Cyla Müller, whom he would marry in 1936. Hillel fell and broke his back in 1923 and died the following year. Rosa remarried in 1926 and moved to Dolyna with her new husband, Isack Halperin, who owned a tile factory there. Wiesenthal remained in Buczacz, living with the Müller family, until he graduated from high school—on his second attempt—in 1928. With an interest in art and drawing, Wiesenthal chose to study architecture. His first choice was to attend the Lwów Polytechnic, but he was turned away because the school's Jewish quota had already been filled. He instead enrolled at the Czech Technical University in Prague, where he studied from 1928 until 1932. He was apprenticed as a building engineer through 1934 and 1935, spending most of that period in Odessa. He married Cyla in 1936 when he returned to Galicia. Sources give differing reports of what happened next. Wiesenthal's autobiographies contradict each other on many points; he also over-dramatised and mythologised events. One version has Wiesenthal opening an architectural office and finally being admitted to the Lwów Polytechnic for an advanced degree. He designed a tuberculosis sanatorium and some residential buildings during the course of his studies and was active in a student Zionist organisation. He wrote for the Omnibus, a satirical student newspaper, and graduated in 1939. Author Guy Walters states that Wiesenthal's earliest autobiography does not mention studies at Lwów. Walters quotes a curriculum vitae Wiesenthal prepared after World War II as stating he worked as a supervisor at a factory until 1939 and then worked as a mechanic in a different factory until the Nazis invaded in 1941. Wiesenthal's 1961 book Ich Jagte Eichmann (\\"I Hunted Eichmann\\") states that he worked in Odessa as an engineer from 1940 to 1941. Walters says that there is no record of Wiesenthal attending the university at Lwów, and that he does not appear in the Katalog Architektów i Budowniczych (Catalogue of Architects and Builders) for the appropriate period. World War II In Europe, World War II began in September 1939 with the Nazi invasion of Poland. As a result of the partitioning of Poland under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union, the city of Lwów was annexed by the Soviets and became known as Lvov in Russian or Lviv in Ukrainian. Wiesenthal's stepfather, still living in Dolyna, was arrested as a capitalist; he later died in a Soviet prison. Wiesenthal's mother moved to Lvov to live with Wiesenthal and Cyla. Wiesenthal bribed an official to prevent his own deportation under Clause 11, a rule that prevented all Jewish professionals and intellectuals from living within of the city, which was under Soviet occupation until the Germans invaded in June 1941. Lwów Ghetto, 1942 By mid-July Wiesenthal and other Jewish residents had to register to do forced labour. Within six months, in November 1941 the Nazis had set up the Lwów Ghetto using Jewish forced labour. All Jews had to give up their homes and move there, a process completed in the following months. Several thousand Jews were murdered in Lvov by Ukrainian nationals and German Einsatzgruppen in June and July 1941. In his autobiographies, Wiesenthal tells how he was arrested on 6 July, but saved from execution by his former foreman, a man named Bodnar, who was now a member of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police. There are several versions of the story, which may be apocryphal. In late 1941, Wiesenthal and his wife were transferred to Janowska concentration camp and forced to work at the Eastern Railway Repair Works. He painted swastikas and other inscriptions on captured Soviet railway engines, and Cyla was put to work polishing the brass and nickel. In exchange for providing details about the railways, Wiesenthal obtained false identity papers for his wife from a member of the Armia Krajowa, a Polish underground organisation. She travelled to Warsaw, where she was put to work in a German radio factory. She spent time in two labour camps as well. Conditions were harsh and her health was permanently damaged, but she survived the war. The couple was reunited in 1945, and their daughter Paulinka was born the following year. Every few weeks, the Nazis staged a roundup in the Lvov ghetto of people unable to work. These roundups typically took place while the able-bodied were absent doing forced labour. In one such deportation, Wiesenthal's mother and other elderly Jewish women were transported by freight train to Belzec extermination camp and killed in August 1942. Around the same time, a Ukrainian policeman shot Cyla's mother to death on the front porch of her home in Buczacz while she was being evicted. Cyla and Simon Wiesenthal lost 89 relatives during the Holocaust. Forced labourers for the Eastern Railway were eventually kept in a separate closed camp, where conditions were a little better than at the main camp at Janowska. Wiesenthal prepared architectural drawings for Adolf Kohlrautz, the senior inspector, who submitted them under his own name. To obtain contracts, construction companies paid bribes to Kohlrautz, who shared some of the money with Wiesenthal. He was able to pass along further information about the railroads to the underground and occasionally left the compound to obtain supplies, even clandestinely obtaining weapons for the Armia Krajowa and two pistols for himself, which he brought with him when he escaped in late 1943. According to Wiesenthal, on 20 April 1943, Second Lieutenant Gustav Wilhaus, second in command at the Janowska camp, decided to shoot 54 Jewish intellectuals in celebration of Hitler's 54th birthday. Unable to find enough such people still alive at Janowska, Wilhaus ordered a roundup of prisoners from the satellite camps. Wiesenthal and two other inmates were taken from the Eastern Railway camp to the execution site, a trench deep and long at a nearby sandpit. The men were stripped and led through \\"the Hose\\", a six- or seven-foot wide barbed wire corridor to the execution ground. The victims were shot and their bodies allowed to fall into the pit. Wiesenthal, waiting to be shot, heard someone call out his name. He was returned alive to the camp; Kohlrautz had convinced his superiors that Wiesenthal was the best man available to paint a giant poster in honour of Hitler's birthday. On 2 October 1943, according to Wiesenthal, Kohlrautz warned him that the camp and its prisoners were about to be liquidated. Kohlrautz gave Wiesenthal and fellow prisoner Arthur Scheiman passes to go to town, accompanied by a Ukrainian guard, to buy stationery. The two men escaped out the back of the shop while their guard waited at the front counter. Wiesenthal did not mention either of these events—or Kohlrautz's part in them—when testifying to American investigators in May 1945, or in an affidavit he made in August 1954 about his wartime persecutions, and researcher Guy Walters questions their authenticity. Wiesenthal variously reported that Kohlrautz was killed on the Soviet Front in 1944 or in the Battle of Berlin on 19 April 1945. Mauthausen greet American forces, May 1945 After several days in hiding, Scheiman rejoined his wife, and Wiesenthal was taken by members of the underground to the nearby village of Kulparkow, where he remained until the end of 1943. Soon afterwards the Janowska camp was liquidated; this made it unsafe to hide in the nearby countryside, so Wiesenthal returned to Lvov, where he spent three days hiding in a closet at the Scheimans' apartment. He then moved to the apartment of Paulina Busch, for whom he had previously forged an identity card. He was arrested there, hiding under the floorboards, on 13 June 1944 and taken back to the remains of the camp at Janowska. Wiesenthal tried but failed to commit suicide to avoid being interrogated about his connections with the underground. In the end there was no time for interrogations, as Soviet forces were advancing into the area. SS-Hauptsturmfuhrer Friedrich Warzok, the new camp commandant, rounded up the remaining prisoners and transported them to Przemyśl, west of Lvov, where he put them to work building fortifications. By September Warzok and his men were reassigned to the front, and Wiesenthal and the other surviving captives were sent to the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp. By October the inmates were evacuated to Gross-Rosen concentration camp, where inmates were suffering from severe overcrowding and a shortage of food. Wiesenthal's big toe on his right foot had to be amputated after a rock fell on it while he was working in the quarry. He was still ill in January when the advancing Soviets forced yet another evacuation, this time on foot, to Chemnitz. Using a broom handle for a walking stick, he was one of the few who survived the march. From Chemnitz the prisoners were taken in open freight cars to Buchenwald, and a few days later by truck to Mauthausen concentration camp, arriving in mid-February 1945. Over half the prisoners did not survive the journey. Wiesenthal was placed in a death block for the mortally ill, where he survived on 200 calories a day until the camp was liberated by the Americans on 5 May 1945. He weighed when he was liberated. Nazi hunter Within three weeks of the liberation of Mauthausen, Wiesenthal had prepared a list of around a hundred names of suspected Nazi war criminals—mostly guards, camp commandants, and members of the Gestapo—and presented it to a War Crimes office of the American Counterintelligence Corps at Mauthausen. He worked as an interpreter, accompanying officers who were carrying out arrests, though he was still very frail. When Austria was partitioned in July 1945, Mauthausen fell into the Soviet-occupied zone, so the American War Crimes Office was moved to Linz. Wiesenthal went with them, and was housed in a displaced persons camp. He served as vice-chairman of the area's Jewish Central Committee, an organisation that attempted to arrange basic care for Jewish refugees and tried to help people gather information about their missing family members. Wiesenthal worked for the American Office of Strategic Services for a year, and continued to collect information on both victims and perpetrators of the Holocaust. He assisted the Berihah, an underground organisation that smuggled Jewish survivors into the British Mandate for Palestine. Wiesenthal helped arrange for forged papers, food supplies, transportation, and so on. In February 1947, he and 30 other volunteers founded the Jewish Documentation Center in Linz to gather information for future war crimes trials. They collected 3,289 depositions from concentration camp survivors still living in Europe. However, as the US and the Soviet Union lost interest in conducting further trials, a similar group headed by Tuviah Friedman in Vienna closed its office in 1952, and Wiesenthal's closed in 1954. Almost all of the documentation collected at both centres was forwarded to the Yad Vashem archives in Israel. Wiesenthal, employed full-time by two Jewish welfare agencies, continued his work with refugees. As it became clear that the former Allies were no longer interested in pursuing the work of bringing Nazi war criminals to justice, Wiesenthal persisted, believing the survivors were obliged to take on the task. His work became a way to memorialise and remember all the people that had been lost. He told biographer Alan Levy in 1974: =Adolf Eichmann= Though most of the Jews still alive in Linz after the war had emigrated, Wiesenthal decided to stay on, partly because the family of Adolf Eichmann lived a few blocks away from him. Eichmann had been in charge of the transportation and deportation of Jews in the Nazi Final Solution to the Jewish Question: a plan, finalised at the Wannsee Conference—at which Eichmann took the minutes—to exterminate all the Jews in Europe. After the war, Eichmann hid in Austria using forged identity papers until 1950, when he left via Italy and moved to Argentina under an assumed name. Hoping to obtain information on Eichmann's whereabouts, Wiesenthal continuously monitored the remaining members of the immediate family in Linz until they vanished in 1952. Document under the name of Ricardo Klement that Adolf Eichmann used to enter Argentina in 1950 Wiesenthal learned from a letter shown to him in 1953 that Eichmann had been seen in Buenos Aires, and he passed along that information to the Israeli consulate in Vienna in 1954. Fritz Bauer, prosecutor-general of the state of Hesse in West Germany, received independent confirmation of Eichmann's whereabouts in 1957, but German agents were unable to find him until late 1959. When Eichmann's father died in 1960, Wiesenthal made arrangements for private detectives to surreptitiously photograph members of the family, as Eichmann's brother Otto was said to bear a strong family resemblance and there were no current photos of the fugitive. He provided these photographs to Mossad agents on 18 February. Zvi Aharoni, one of the Mossad agents responsible for Eichmann's capture in Buenos Aires on 11 May 1960, said the photos were useful in confirming Eichmann's identity. On 23 May Israeli Prime Minister David Ben- Gurion announced Eichmann was under arrest and in Israel. The next day Wiesenthal, while he was being interviewed by reporters, received a congratulatory telegram from Yad Vashem. He immediately became a minor celebrity, and began work on a book about his experiences. Ich jagte Eichmann: Tatsachenbericht (I Chased Eichmann: A True Story) was published six weeks before the trial opened in spring 1961. Wiesenthal helped the prosecution prepare their case and attended a portion of the trial. Eichmann was sentenced to death and was hanged on 1 June 1962. Meanwhile, both of Wiesenthal's employers terminated his services in 1960, as there were too few refugees left in the city to justify the expense. Wiesenthal opened a new documentation centre (the Documentation Centre of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime) in Vienna in 1961. He became a Mossad operative, for which he received the equivalent of several hundred dollars per month. He maintained files on hundreds of suspected Nazi war criminals and located many, about six of whom were arrested as a result of his activities. Successes included locating and bringing to trial Erich Rajakowitsch, responsible for the deportation of Jews from the Netherlands, and Franz Murer, the commandant of the Vilna Ghetto. In 1963 Wiesenthal read in the newspaper that Karl Silberbauer, the man who had arrested famed diarist Anne Frank, had been located; he was serving on the police force in Vienna. Wiesenthal's publicity campaign led to Silberbauer being temporarily suspended from the force, but he was never prosecuted for arresting the Frank family. In spite of Wiesenthal's protests, in late 1963 his centre in Vienna was taken over by a local community group, so he immediately set up a new independent office, funded using donations and his stipend from the Mossad. As the 20-year statute of limitations for German war crimes was about to expire, Wiesenthal began lobbying to have it extended or removed entirely. In March 1965 the Bundestag deferred the matter for five years, effectively extending the expiration date. Similar action was taken by the Austrian government. But as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions. Witnesses grew older and were less likely to be able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, as the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past. =Franz Stangl= Franz Stangl was a supervisor at the Hartheim Euthanasia Centre, part of Action T4, an early Nazi euthanasia programme that was responsible for the deaths of over 70,000 mentally ill or physically deformed people in Germany. In February 1942, he was commander at the Sobibor extermination camp and in August of the same year he was transferred to Treblinka. During his time at these camps, he oversaw the deaths of nearly 900,000 people. While in U.S. detention for two years, he remained unidentified as a war criminal because so few witnesses had survived Sobibor and Treblinka that authorities never realised who he was. He escaped while on a roadwork detail in Linz in May 1948. After he made his way to Rome, the Caritas relief agency provided him with a Red Cross passport and a boat ticket to Syria. His family joined him there a year later and they emigrated to Brazil in 1951. It was probably Stangl's brother-in law who informed Wiesenthal of Stangl's whereabouts in 1964. Concerned that Stangl would be warned and escape, Wiesenthal quietly prepared a dossier with the assistance of Austrian Minister of Justice Hans Klecatsky. Stangl was arrested outside his home in São Paulo on 28 February 1967 and was extradited to Germany on 22 June. A month later Wiesenthal's book The Murderers Among Us was released. Wiesenthal's publishers advertised that he had been responsible for locating over 800 Nazis, a claim that had no basis in fact but was nonetheless repeated by reputable newspapers such as the New York Times. Stangl was sentenced to life in prison and died of heart failure in June 1971, having confessed his guilt to biographer Gitta Sereny the previous day. =Hermine Braunsteiner= Known as \\"the Mare of Majdanek\\", Hermine Braunsteiner was a guard who served at Majdanek and Ravensbrück concentration camps. A cruel and sadistic woman, she earned her nickname for her propensity to kick her victims to death. She served a three-year sentence in Austria for her activities in Ravensbrück, but had not yet been charged for any of her crimes at Majdanek when she emigrated to the United States in 1959. She became an American citizen in 1963. Wiesenthal was first told about Braunsteiner in early 1964 via a chance encounter in Tel Aviv with someone who had seen her performing selections at Majdanek—deciding who was to be assigned to slave labour and who was to immediately be killed in the gas chambers. When he returned to Vienna he had an operative visit one of her relatives to clandestinely collect information. Wiesenthal soon traced Braunsteiner's whereabouts to Queens, New York, so he notified the Israeli police and the New York Times. In spite of Wiesenthal's efforts to expedite the matter, Braunsteiner was not extradited to Germany until 1973. Her trial was part of a joint indictment with nine other defendants accused of killing 250,000 people at Majdanek. She was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1981 and died in 1999. =Josef Mengele= Josef Mengele was a medical officer assigned to Auschwitz concentration camp from 1943 until the end of the war. As well as making most of the selections of inmates as they arrived by train from all over Europe, he performed unscientific and usually deadly experiments on the inmates. He left the camp in January 1945 as the Red Army approached and was briefly in American custody in Weiden in der Oberpfalz, but was released. He took work as a farm hand in rural Germany, remaining until 1949, when he decided to flee the country. He acquired a Red Cross passport and left for Argentina, setting up a business in Buenos Aires in 1951. Acting on information received from Wiesenthal, West German authorities tried to extradite Mengele in 1960, but he could not be found; he had in fact moved to Paraguay in 1958. He moved to Brazil in 1961 and lived there until his death in 1979. Wiesenthal claimed to have information that placed Mengele in several locations: on the Greek island of Kythnos in 1960, Cairo in 1961, in Spain in 1971, and in Paraguay in 1978, the latter eighteen years after he had left. In 1982, he offered a reward of $100,000 for Mengele's capture and insisted as late as 1985—six years after Mengele's death—that he was still alive. The Mengele family admitted to authorities in 1985 that he had died in 1979; the body was exhumed and its identity was confirmed. Earlier that year Wiesenthal had served as one of the judges at a mock trial of Mengele, held in Jerusalem. =Simon Wiesenthal Centre= Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Los Angeles The Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Los Angeles was founded in 1977 by Rabbi Marvin Hier, who paid Wiesenthal an honorarium for the right to use his name. The centre helped with the campaign to remove the statute of limitations on Nazi crimes and continues the hunt for suspected Nazi war criminals, but today its primary activities include Holocaust remembrance, education, and fighting antisemitism. Wiesenthal was not always happy with the way the centre was run. He thought the centre's Holocaust museum was not dignified enough and that he should have a larger say in the overall operations. He even wrote to the Board of Directors requesting Hier's removal, but in the end had to be content with being a figurehead. Later lifeAustrian politics=Bruno Kreisky Shortly after Bruno Kreisky was inaugurated as Austrian chancellor in April 1970, Wiesenthal pointed out to the press that four of his new cabinet appointees had been members of the Nazi Party. In an address in June, Kreisky's Minister of Education and Culture Leopold Gratz characterised Wiesenthal's Documentation Centre of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime as a private spy ring, invading the privacy of innocent parties. In an interview a week later, Kreisky himself described Wiesenthal as a \\"Jewish fascist\\", a remark he later denied making. Wiesenthal discovered that he would be unable to sue, because under Austrian law Kreisky was protected by parliamentary immunity. When his re-election in 1975 seemed unsure, Kreisky proposed that his Social Democratic Party should form a coalition with the Freedom Party, headed by Friedrich Peter. Wiesenthal was in possession of information proving that Peter had been a member of the 1 SS Infantry Brigade, a unit that had exterminated over 13,000 Jewish civilians in Ukraine in 1941–42. He decided not to reveal this information to the press until after the election, but forwarded his dossier to President Rudolf Kirchschläger. Peter denied having participated in, or having knowledge of, any atrocities. In the end, Kreisky's party won a clear majority and did not form the coalition. In a press conference a short time after the election and Wiesenthal's revelations, Kreisky said Wiesenthal used \\"the methods of a quasi-political Mafia.\\" Wiesenthal filed a libel lawsuit (although Kreisky had the power to declare immunity if he so chose), and when Kreisky later accused Wiesenthal of being an agent of the Gestapo, working with the Judenrat in Lvov, these accusations were incorporated into the lawsuit as well. The suit was decided in Wiesenthal's favour in 1989, but after Kreisky's death nine months later his heirs refused to pay. When the relevant archives were later opened for research, no evidence was found that Wiesenthal had been a collaborator. Kurt Waldheim When Kurt Waldheim was named secretary-general of the United Nations in 1971, Wiesenthal reported—without checking very thoroughly—that there was no evidence that he had a Nazi past. This analysis had been supported by the opinions of the American Counterintelligence Corps and Office of Strategic Services when they examined his records right after the war. However, Waldheim's 1985 autobiography did not include his war service following his recuperation from a 1941 injury. When he returned to active duty in 1942, he was posted to Yugoslavia and Greece, and had knowledge of murders of civilians that took place in those locations during his service there. The Austrian news magazine Profil published a story in March 1986—during his campaign for the presidency of Austria—that Waldheim had been a member of the Sturmabteilung (SA). The New York Times soon reported that Waldheim had failed to reveal all of the facts about his war service. Wiesenthal, embarrassed, attempted to help Waldheim defend himself. The World Jewish Congress investigated the issue, but the Israeli attorney general concluded that their material was insufficient evidence for a conviction. Waldheim was elected president in July 1986. A panel of historians tasked with investigating the case issued a report eighteen months later. They concluded that, while there was no evidence that Waldheim had committed atrocities, he must have known they were occurring, yet did nothing. Wiesenthal unsuccessfully demanded that Waldheim resign. The World Jewish Congress successfully lobbied to have Waldheim barred from entering the United States. =Sails of Hope= In 1968, Wiesenthal published Zeilen der hoop. De geheime missie van Christoffel Columbus (translated in 1972 as Sails of Hope: The Secret Mission of Christopher Columbus), which was his first non-fiction book not on the subject of the Holocaust. In the book, Wiesenthal put forward his theory that Christopher Columbus was a Sephardi Jew from Spain who practised his religion in secret to avoid persecution. (The consensus of most historians is that Columbus came from the Republic of Genoa, in present-day Italy). Wiesenthal argued that the quest for the New World was not motivated by wealth or fame, but rather by Columbus's desire to find a place of refuge for the Jews, who were suffering immense persecution in Spain at the time (and in 1492 would be subjected to the Edict of Expulsion). Wiesenthal also believed that Columbus's concept of \\"sailing west\\" was based on Biblical prophecies (certain verses in the Book of Isaiah) rather than any prior geographical knowledge. =Awards and nominations= Wiesenthal was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, the fortieth anniversary of the end of the war. Rumour had it that the Nobel Committee would give the prize to a Holocaust-related candidate. Fellow Holocaust survivor and author Elie Wiesel, also nominated, began a campaign in hopes of winning the prize, travelling to France, Ethiopia and Oslo for speaking tours and humanitarian work. Rabbi Hier of the Wiesenthal Centre urged Wiesenthal to lobby for the prize as well, but other than delivering a lecture in Oslo, Wiesenthal did little to promote his candidacy. When Wiesel was awarded the 1986 prize, Wiesenthal claimed the World Jewish Congress must have influenced the Committee's decision, a claim the WJC denied. Biographer Tom Segev speculates that the loss may have been because of the negative publicity over the Waldheim affair. In 1992, Wiesenthal was awarded the Erasmus Prize by the Praemium Erasmianum Foundation. In 2004, he was awarded an honorary KBE by the British Government. =Retirement and death= Wiesenthal's grave in Herzliya, Israel Wiesenthal received many death threats over the years. After a bomb placed by neo-Nazis exploded outside his house in Vienna on 11 June 1982, police guards were stationed outside his home 24 hours a day. Cyla found the stressful nature of her husband's career and the dragged-out legal matters regarding Kreisky to be overwhelming, and she sometimes suffered from depression. Wiesenthal spent time at his office at the Documentation Centre of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime in Vienna even as he approached his 90th birthday. The last Nazi he had a hand in bringing to trial was Untersturmführer Julius Viel, who was convicted in 2001 of shooting seven Jewish prisoners. Cyla died on 10 November 2003, at age 95. Wiesenthal retired shortly afterward. \\"I have survived them all. If there were any left, they'd be too old and weak to stand trial today. My work is done,\\" said Wiesenthal. Wiesenthal died on 20 September 2005, at age 96, and was buried in Herzliya, Israel. In a statement on Wiesenthal's death, Council of Europe chairman Terry Davis said, \\"Without Simon Wiesenthal's relentless effort to find Nazi criminals and bring them to justice, and to fight anti-Semitism and prejudice, Europe would never have succeeded in healing its wounds and reconciling itself. He was a soldier of justice, which is indispensable to our freedom, stability and peace.\\" In 2010 the Austrian and Israeli governments jointly issued a commemorative stamp honouring Wiesenthal. Wiesenthal became an avid stamp collector after the war, following advice from his doctors to take up a hobby to help him relax. In 2006 his collection of Zemstvo stamps sold at auction for €90,000 after his death. Dramatic portrayals Wiesenthal was portrayed by Israeli actor Shmuel Rodensky in the film adaptation of Frederick Forsyth's The Odessa File (1974). After the film's release, Wiesenthal received many reports of sightings of the subject of the film, Eduard Roschmann, commandant of the Riga Ghetto. These sightings proved to be false alarms, but in 1977 a person living in Buenos Aires who saw the movie reported to police that Roschmann was living nearby. The fugitive escaped to Paraguay, where he died of a heart attack a month later. In Ira Levin's novel The Boys from Brazil, the character of Yakov Liebermann (called Ezra Liebermann and played by Laurence Olivier in the film) is modelled on Wiesenthal. Olivier visited Wiesenthal, who offered advice on how to play the role. Wiesenthal attended the film's New York premiere in 1978. Ben Kingsley portrayed him in the HBO film Murderers Among Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story (1989). Wiesenthal has been the subject of several documentaries. The Art of Remembrance: Simon Wiesenthal was produced in 1994 by filmmakers Hannah Heer and Werner Schmiedel for River Lights Pictures. The documentary I Have Never Forgotten You: The Life and Legacy of Simon Wiesenthal, narrated by Nicole Kidman, was released by Moriah Films in 2007. Wiesenthal is a one-person show written and performed by Tom Dugan that premiered in 2014. Autobiographical inconsistencies A number of Wiesenthal's books contain conflicting stories and tales, many of which were invented. Several authors, including Segev and British author Guy Walters, feel that Wiesenthal's autobiographies are not reliable sources of information about his life and activities. For example, Wiesenthal would describe two people fighting over one of the lists he had prepared of survivors of the Holocaust; the two look up and recognise each other and have a tearful reunion. In one account it is a man and wife, and in another telling it is two brothers. Wiesenthal's memoirs variously claim he had spent time in as many as eleven concentration camps; the actual number was five. A drawing he made in 1945 that he claimed was a scene he witnessed in Mauthausen had actually been sketched from photos that appeared in Life magazine that June. He particularly over-emphasised his role in the capture of Eichmann, claiming that he prevented Veronika Eichmann from having her husband declared dead in 1947, when in fact the declaration was denied by government officials. Wiesenthal said that he had retained his Eichmann file when he sent his research materials to Yad Vashem in 1952; in fact he sent all his materials there, and it was his counterpart, Tuviah Friedman in Vienna, who had retained materials on Eichmann. Isser Harel, director of the Mossad at the time, has stated that Wiesenthal had no role in the capture of Eichmann. Walters and Segev both noted inconsistencies between Wiesenthal's stories and his actual achievements. Segev concluded that Wiesenthal lied because of his storytelling nature and survivor guilt. Daniel Finkelstein described Walters's research in Hunting Evil as impeccable and quoted Ben Barkow: \\"Accepting that Wiesenthal was a showman and a braggart and, yes, even a liar, can live alongside acknowledging the contribution he made\\". In 1979, Wiesenthal told The Washington Post: \\"I have sought with Jewish leaders not to talk about 6 million Jewish dead [in the Holocaust], but rather about 11 million civilians dead, including 6 million Jews.\\" In a 2017 interview, Yehuda Bauer said that he had told Wiesenthal not to use this figure. \\"I said to him, 'Simon, you are telling a lie,' ... [Wiesenthal replied] 'Sometimes you need to do that to get the results for things you think are essential.'\\" According to Bauer and other historians, Wiesenthal chose the figure of 5 million non-Jewish victims because it was just lower than the six million Jews who died, but high enough to attract sympathy from non-Jews. The figure of eleven million Nazi victims became popular and was referred to by President Jimmy Carter in the executive order establishing the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.

He was kidnapped and assassinated in the same year. A civil engineer who graduated in 1973 from the Engenharia Mauá School, in São Caetano do Sul, he followed an academic career and obtained a master's degree in Public Administration from the Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV-SP) and a doctorate in Political Science from the Pontifícia Universidade Católica (PUC-SP). He acted later as a teacher in both universities. As mayor he was connected to the United Nations Urban Management Programme. Celso Daniel's murder has not been properly solved by the local authorities, and the conclusions obtained by the investigations are still under dispute; the criminals who kidnapped him have been arrested but theories about their motivation for the crime vary from suggestions that it was a botched kidnapping attempt caused by a misunderstanding of the mayor's identity to theories that the crime was politically motivated and the killers were actually paid by figures of Daniel's own political party, PT. Since the beginning of the investigation, seven witnesses have been found dead. Assassination Celso Daniel was kidnapped on January 18, 2002 while leaving a restaurant late at night in the neighborhood of Jardins, in São Paulo. He left the restaurant in an armoured Pajero driven by his former body-guard Sérgio Gomes da Silva, nicknamed Sombra (\\"Shadow\\"). The car was followed by kidnappers in other cars, and near the number 393 of Rua Antônio Bezerra, in the neighborhood of Sacomã, the cars managed to block their path. Shots were fired against the tires and the glasses; Da Silva, who was the driver, said that at that moment the brakes and the transmission didn't work. According to him, the armed criminals opened the door of the car, grabbed the mayor and took him away, while he stayed in the area and remained unscathed. On the morning of Sunday January 20, the body of Celso Daniel, with 11 gunshot wounds, was found in the Estrada das Cachoeiras in the neighborhood of Carmo in the city of Juquitiba, along the Régis Bittencourt Highway (BR-116). =Investigation= The São Paulo police concluded their investigation on April 1, 2002. According to their final report, presented by Armando de Oliveira Costa Filho of the Department of Homicide (DHPP), six individuals of a criminal gang from a favela called Pantanal in the southern part of São Paulo committed the crime. One of the accused, a minor, confessed to having shot the mayor. The political investigation concluded that the criminals had kidnapped the mayor for profit and had mistaken him for a different person, a businessman whose identity was not revealed, supposedly the true target of the kidnapping. The member of the criminal band were identified as: Rodolfo Rodrigo de Souza Oliveira (Bozinho), José Édson da Silva (Édson), Itamar Messias Silva dos Santos (Itamar), Marcos Roberto Bispo dos Santos (Marquinhos), and Elcyd Oliveira Brito (John). The leader of the group was identified as Ivan Rodrigues da Silva (Monstro, \\"Monster\\" in Portuguese). The area of his captivity was chosen by Édson, who had rented a spot in the city of Juquitiba for this purpose. Two cars were stolen for the kidnapping, a Chevrolet S-10 Blazer and a Volkswagen Santana. The gang assembled on January 17, 2002 and decided that the kidnapping would take place the following day. In the afternoon of January 18, 2002, Monstro and Marquinhos left in one car and the other members in another; Monstro coordinated the operation with a cell phone. The members in the second car began to pursue the businessman they hoped to detain, but lost sight of his vehicle; Monstro then ordered them to abort the planned action and seize the passenger of the first expensive foreign car they encountered. The criminals continued to drive through the area and chose the Pajero of Celso Daniel and Sérgio Gomes as their target. The group began to pursue the vehicle and eventually crashed into it. Itamar and Bonzinho exited their car firing at the Pajero and grabbed Celso Daniel from the car. He was then taken to the Pantanal favela, between Diadema and São Paulo. In the favela, the criminals took Daniel out of the Blazer, placed him in the Santana and drove him to their planned captivity spot in Juquitiba. On January 19, the gang learned from the newspapers that they had kidnapped the mayor of Santo André. They were shocked and resolved to give up. Monstro told Edson that the victim had to be \\"dismissed\\". According to the other members of the gang, Monstro intended to communicate that the mayor should be freed. However, Edson claimed to have misinterpreted this remark as meaning he should be killed. He ordered an underage boy named Lalo to kill the mayor at the Estrada da Cachoeira, in Juquitiba. Two days later, his body was found with eight gunshot wounds. Celso Daniel's family was not satisfied with the finding of the initial inquiry, and believe that the crime had a political motivation. An analysis of the car revealed that it did not have any electrical or mechanical faults, and they didn't accept Sérgio Gomes da Silva's story that these faults prevented an escape. After the death of Celso Daniel, six other individuals were assassinated in an apparently mysterious manner, including the individual who found the body and the waiter who had served Celso Daniel the night of the crime. One of public prosecutors showed the minor alleged to have fired the shot a photo of Celso Daniel, whom he apparently failed to recognize. The family continued to press the authorities to reopen the case, and on August 5, 2002, the São Paulo State Attorney General agreed to launch a reopening. =Hypothesis of a political crime= Many members of the family continue to believe the crime had political motivations. According to Celso Daniel's brother, doctor João Francisco Daniel, he was murdered because he had prepared a report on corruption in Santo André. João alleged that his brother was a part of a corruption scheme in Santo André used to divert funds to the Brazilians Worker's Party (PT). The supposed scheme involved members of the municipal government and businesspeople in the transportation sector, and key PT figures like José Dirceu and Gilberto Carvalho, Brazilian President Lula's personal secretary. According to João, some members of the scheme began to divert funds illegally marked to PT into their own personal accounts. When Celso Daniel discovered this change, he supposedly prepared a report revealing the scheme. Because of this action, his brother says he was assassinated and the report disappeared. The convict José Felício, also known as \\"Geleião\\", told the police that he had heard about this report and the accompanying threat to the mayor's life. Sérgio Gomes da Silva was later indicted and accused of being the mastermind of the assassination in connection with the corruption scheme. He died of natural causes in 2016.

He studied with Andrés Segovia, and gave concerts all over the world. A guitar competition named Concurso Internacional de Guitarra Alirio Díaz has been held in his honor in Caracas and other cities in Venezuela (the April 2006 contest was held in Carora). Many compositions have been dedicated to Díaz including Spanish composer Joaquín Rodrigo's Invocación y Danza. Biography The eighth of eleven children, Díaz was born in Caserio La Candelaria, a small village near Carora in western Venezuela. From childhood he showed a great interest in music. His uncle was his first guitar teacher. At age 16 he ran away from home to Carora, where he sought better schooling. He later went to Trujillo in the Venezuelan Andes and studied saxophone and clarinet under Laudelino Mejías while working as a typesetter in a newspaper. He also studied English before going to Caracas in 1945 to study the guitar at the Escuela Superior de Musica José Ángel Lamas under Raul Borges. In 1950, the Venezuelan government awarded him a scholarship to continue his guitar studies in Madrid under Regino Sainz de la Maza. That same year he performed his first guitar concert in Europe. In 1951 he went to Accademia Musicale Chigiana of Siena (Italy), to study with Andrés Segovia. There he impressed Segovia greatly with his flawless technique and extensive repertoire. Three years later, he progressed to become the assistant and substitute to Segovia, and started performing in some of the most prestigious concert halls of Europe. In 1961, Spanish composer Joaquín Rodrigo's piece Invocación y Danza, dedicated to Alirio Díaz, won the First Prize at the Coupe International de Guitare awarded by the Office de Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française (ORTF). In turn, Díaz obliged and the next year performed this very difficult solo piece. It has also been recorded by Díaz.Reissue on CD: Alirio Diaz - DoremiAlirio Díaz's recording of Invocation et Danse This was one of many compositions dedicated to Alirio Díaz. Alirio Díaz performed all over the world combining baroque music with the works of modern Latin American composers, such as Lauro, Sojo and Barrios Mangoré. He taught in Rome and performed in concert with his son Senio. During the European winter, he used to return to Venezuela to his native town, La Candelaria. Europe When the young Venezuelan musician concluded his studies, he traveled to Europe for a post-graduate degree. Soon after his arrival he was welcomed by a large group of representative figures of Venezuelan culture, and the Ministry of Education responded by approving a grant for Diaz. In November he attended the Conservatory of Music of Madrid, hosted by Regino Sainz de la Maza. Studying here had an excellent effect on Diaz and he gave successful recitals in the most important centers of Spanish culture including Ateneo de Madrid, Teatro Español, Palau de la Música in Barcelona, the Alhambra in Granada, Teatro Principal in Valencia. Close friendly relations developed with intellectuals and musicians Piego Gerardo, Joaquin Rodrigo, Moreno Torroba, Garcia Nieto, Narciso Yepez, Emilio Pujol, Daniel Fortea, Eugenia Serrano, Federico Monpou, Xavier Montsalvage and Joaquin Achucarro. =Italy= In Siena, Díaz continued his studies with Andres Segovia at the Chigiana Academy of that city. A couple of years later Diaz became not only the disciple of the Segovia but also his assistant and substitute at the Chigiana Academy. He befriended Venezuelan authors Raul Borges, Vicente Emilio Sojo and Juan Bautista Plaza. In a recital in Rome, Diaz was sponsored by the poet and Venezuelan ambassador Alberto Arvelo Torrealba. Based in Italy, he first toured throughout the European continent to eventually perform on five continents. He appeared as soloist with symphonic orchestras under the direction of conductors like Sergiu Celibidache, Leopold Stokowski, Antonio Estévez, Andre Kostelanetz, Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos, Jose Iturbi, among others. Following in the footsteps of Vicente Emilio Sojo, he spent much of his time on their trips to Venezuela collecting folk songs. His guitar arrangements of these songs continue to be performed around the world. Díaz published many editions of his guitar arrangements and made recordings. His research is conducted from a critical, analytical and musicological point of view. He published a book called \\"Música en la vida y lucha del pueblo venezolano\\" (\\"Music in the life and struggle of the Venezuelan people\\") and wrote for various newspapers and Venezuelan magazines. Much of this work is also reflected in his autobiographical work Al divisar el humo de la aldea nativa (\\"On seeing the smoke from the native village\\"). He died in Rome on 5 July 2016.Venezuelan Guitar Titan Alirio Díaz Dies at 92—An Appreciation Alirio Díaz International Guitar Competition Since 1974 the Alirio Díaz International Guitar Competition pays tribute to the art of this Venezuelan virtuoso and celebrates his invaluable contribution to guitar learning on national and international levels.

It can be difficult to distinguish from schizoaffective disorder, a diagnosis that requires the presence of psychotic symptoms for at least two weeks without any mood symptoms present. Unipolar psychotic depression requires that the psychotic features occur only during episodes of major depression. Diagnosis using the DSM-5 involves meeting the criteria for a major depressive episode, along with the criteria for \\"mood-congruent or mood-incongruent psychotic features\\" specifier.  Signs and symptoms  Individuals with psychotic depression experience the symptoms of a major depressive episode, along with one or more psychotic symptoms, including delusions and/or hallucinations. Delusions can be classified as mood congruent or incongruent, depending on whether or not the nature of the delusions is in keeping with the individual's mood state. Common themes of mood congruent delusions include guilt, persecution, punishment, personal inadequacy, or disease. Half of patients experience more than one kind of delusion. Delusions occur without hallucinations in about one-half to two-thirds of patients with psychotic depression. Hallucinations can be auditory, visual, olfactory (smell), or haptic (touch), and are congruent with delusional material. Affect is sad, not flat. Severe anhedonia, loss of interest, and psychomotor retardation are typically present.Rothschild, A.J., 2009. Clinical Manual for Diagnosis and Treatment of Psychotic Depression. American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. Washington DC, USA  Cause  Psychotic symptoms tend to develop after an individual has already had several episodes of depression without psychosis. However, once psychotic symptoms have emerged, they tend to reappear with each future depressive episode. The prognosis for psychotic depression is not considered to be as poor as for schizoaffective disorders or primary psychotic disorders. Still, those who have experienced a depressive episode with psychotic features have an increased risk of relapse and suicide compared to those without psychotic features, and they tend to have more pronounced sleep abnormalities. Family members of those who have experienced psychotic depression are at increased risk for both psychotic depression and schizophrenia. Most patients with psychotic depression report having an initial episode between the ages of 20 and 40. As with other depressive episodes, psychotic depression tends to be episodic, with symptoms lasting for a certain amount of time and then subsiding. While psychotic depression can be chronic (lasting more than 2 years), most depressive episodes last less than 24 months. A study conducted by Kathleen S. Bingham found that patients receiving appropriate treatment for psychotic depression went into \\"remission\\". They reported a quality of life similar to that of people without PD.  Pathophysiology  There are a number of biological features that may distinguish psychotic depression from non-psychotic depression. The most significant difference may be the presence of an abnormality in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA). The HPA axis appears to be dysregulated in psychotic depression, with dexamethasone suppression tests demonstrating higher levels of cortisol following dexamethasone administration (i.e. lower cortisol suppression). Those with psychotic depression also have higher ventricular-brain ratios than those with non-psychotic depression. Diagnosis Differential diagnosis = Psychotic symptoms are often missed in psychotic depression, either because patients do not think their symptoms are abnormal or they attempt to conceal their symptoms from others. On the other hand, psychotic depression may be confused with schizoaffective disorder. Due to overlapping symptoms, differential diagnosis includes also dissociative disorders.  Treatment  Several treatment guidelines recommend either the combination of a second-generation antidepressant and atypical antipsychotic or tricyclic antidepressant monotherapy or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as the first-line treatment for unipolar psychotic depression. There is some evidence indicating that combination therapy with an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic is more effective in treating psychotic depression than either antidepressant treatment alone or placebo. Pharmaceutical treatments can include tricyclic antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics, or a combination of an antidepressant from the newer, more well tolerated SSRI or SNRI categories and an atypical antipsychotic. Olanzapine may be an effective monotherapy in psychotic depression, although there is evidence that it is ineffective for depressive symptoms as a monotherapy; and olanzapine/fluoxetine is more effective. Quetiapine monotherapy may be particularly helpful in psychotic depression since it has both antidepressant and antipsychotic effects and a reasonable tolerability profile compared to other atypical antipsychotics. The current drug-based treatments of psychotic depression are reasonably effective but can cause side effects, such as nausea, headaches, dizziness, and weight gain.Mayo Clinic http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/antidepressants/MH00062 Tricyclic antidepressants may be particularly dangerous, because overdosing has the potential to cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias. In the context of psychotic depression, the following are the most well-studied antidepressant/antipsychotic combinations First-generation * Amitriptyline/perphenazine * Amitriptyline/haloperidol Second-generation * Venlafaxine/quetiapine * Olanzapine/fluoxetine * Olanzapine/sertraline In modern practice of ECT a therapeutic clonic seizure is induced by electric current via electrodes placed on an anaesthetised, unconscious patient. Despite much research the exact mechanism of action of ECT is still not known. ECT carries the risk of temporary cognitive deficits (e.g., confusion, memory problems), in addition to the burden of repeated exposures to general anesthesia.  Research  Efforts are made to find a treatment which targets the proposed specific underlying pathophysiology of psychotic depression. A promising candidate was mifepristone, which by competitively blocking certain neuro-receptors, renders cortisol less able to directly act on the brain and was thought to therefore correct an overactive HPA axis. However, a Phase III clinical trial, which investigated the use of mifepristone in PMD, was terminated early due to lack of efficacy.Mifepristone#cite ref-20 Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is being investigated as an alternative to ECT in the treatment of depression. TMS involves the administration of a focused electromagnetic field to the cortex to stimulate specific nerve pathways. Research has shown that psychotic depression differs from non-psychotic depression in a number of ways: potential precipitating factors, underlying biology, symptomatology beyond psychotic symptoms, long-term prognosis, and responsiveness to psychopharmacological treatment and ECT.  Prognosis  The long-term outcome for psychotic depression is generally poorer than for non- psychotic depression.

From the terminus, the roadway goes northeast crossing a railroad three times and Beaver Creek twice before arriving at Beaver Lake. From Beaver Lake, the highway travels north to near the Pysht River and southeast of Clallam Bay, where it ends. After the US 101 intersection in 2007, SR 113 had an estimated daily average of 1,000 motorists, decreased from the estimated 1,500 motorists in 1992. History The current route that SR 113 uses today was first state- maintained in 1937, during the creation of the Primary and secondary system as , extending from Sappho to Port Angeles. The Sappho–Clallam Bay segment was dropped from SSH 9A in 1955 and SSH 9A instead extended west to Neah Bay. SSH 9A later became SR 112 during the 1964 highway renumbering and SR 113 was assigned to a different route. In 1991, SR 113 was given the current route from Sappho to Clallam Bay and no further alignment changes have since happened.

It runs east–west for along the Strait of Juan de Fuca in Clallam County, connecting the Makah Indian Reservation near Neah Bay to U.S. Route 101 (US 101) near Port Angeles. Route description SR 112 crosses the Elwha River Gorge on a deck arch bridge located west of Port Angeles SR 112 begins at the eastern boundary of the Makah Indian Reservation near the mouth of the Sail River. The highway continues west as Bayview Avenue to Neah Bay and Cape Flattery, the northwesternmost point in the contiguous United States. SR 112 travels southeast along the Strait of Juan de Fuca, following a meandering path along the forested foothills of the Northwest Olympic Mountains and crossing several creeks and streams. It also passes a number of resorts and inns, as well as public parks and scenic viewpoints looking across the strait at Vancouver Island. After crossing over the Hoko River near Hoko River State Park, the highway moves further inland before reaching the town of Sekiu and its nearby airport. SR 112 moves back onto the coast and turns south at Clallam Bay, passing through the town and following the Clallam River through a valley leading inland from the coast. The highway leaves the Clallam River and reaches the foothills of Burnt Mountain at a junction with SR 113, which travels south to US 101 at Sappho. SR 112 turns east to follow the Pysht River through another valley that leads towards the strait, rejoining the coast at Pysht near Pillar Point. The highway continues southeast along the coastal bluffs, making hairpin turns to cross several creeks as they empty into the strait. After passing Twin Beach, SR 112 moves further inland and follows a former railroad grade the passes through a rural plain with several communities, including Disque, Joyce, and Ramapo near the Salt Creek Recreation Area. SR 112 passes near the Lower Elwha Indian Reservation and then turns south to cross the Elwha River gorge on a deck arch bridge. An interpretive center was built near the bridge in 2016 as part of the Elwha River dam removal and restoration project. The highway ends after the bridge at an intersection with US 101 west of Port Angeles and William R. Fairchild International Airport. SR 112 is designated as the Strait of Juan de Fuca Highway, a National Scenic Byway that covers all of the route. The western end of the highway is also part of the Cape Flattery Tribal Scenic Byway, a state scenic byway that continues onto the Makah reservation to Neah Bay and Cape Flattery. The Washington State Transportation Commission also designated the section of SR 112 that lies west of SR 113 as the Korean Veterans Blue Star Memorial Highway in 2007 and the eastern half as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway in 2008. SR 112 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on state highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic. Measured traffic volumes on the highway in 2016 ranged from a minimum of 990 at its western terminus to 6,100 near the Elwha River Bridge. The highway is also a designated tsunami evacuation route for various communities along the strait, connecting to logging roads that lead uphill. History The northwestern reach of the Olympic Peninsula was open to logging and settlement in the late 19th century, and a rough trail along the Strait of Juan de Fuca was used by American emigrants. The trail was upgraded to a wagon road and a parallel logging railroad owned by the Milwaukee Road was later built alongside it. The wagon road was maintained by the county government until it was transferred to state control in 1937 and became part of Secondary State Highway 9A (SSH 9A), a highway connecting Sappho to Port Angeles via Pysht. The state government purchased right of way in 1947 to extend SSH 9A to Neah Bay, a year before the existing highway was paved. By 1953, a road extending from Neah Bay to SSH 9A was completed and in 1955, the roadway was added to SSH 9A, while the Sappho segment was deleted. During the 1964 highway renumbering, SSH 9A became SR 112; the highway became a state scenic byway in 1967. The Sappho segment of SSH 9A later was readded to the state highway system in 1991 as . On June 15, 2000, SR 112 became a National Scenic Byway named the Strait of Juan de Fuca Highway. The designation came amid efforts to restore the natural habitat of the region after decades of logging and erosion. It was dedicated in 2001 by local officials and representatives from the tourist and timber industries. A late December winter storm in 2008 resulted in floods that triggered a landslide that closed the highway near Joyce on January 8, 2009. Temporary repairs began on March 2 and only one-way traffic was allowed until the roadway reopened on March 12.

It is sometimes used in literature as a stylistic device. In real-life usage, illeism can reflect a number of different stylistic intentions or involuntary circumstances. In literature Early literature such as Julius Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico or Xenophon's Anabasis, both ostensibly non-fictional accounts of wars led by their authors, used illeism to impart an air of objective impartiality, which included justifications of the author's actions. In this way personal bias is presented, albeit dishonestly, as objectivity. Illeism can also be used in literature to provide a twist, wherein the identity of the narrator as the main character is hidden from the reader until later in the story (e.g. one Arsène Lupin story where the narrator is Arsène Lupin but hides his own identity); the use of third person implies external observation. A similar use is when the author injects himself into his own third person narrative story as a character, such as Charlie Kaufman in Adaptation, Douglas Coupland in JPod, and Clive Cussler's novels, beginning with Dragon. It can also be used as a device to illustrate the feeling of \\"being outside one's body and watching things happen\\", a psychological disconnect resulting from dissonance either from trauma such as childhood physical or sexual abuse, or from past outbursts that cannot be reconciled with the individual's own self-image. The same kind of objective distance can be employed for other purposes. Theologian Richard B. Hays writes an essay where he challenges earlier findings that he disagrees with: \\"These were the findings of one Richard B. Hays, and the newer essay treats the earlier work and earlier author at arms' length.\\"Richard B. Hays, “‘Here We Have No Lasting City’: New Covenantalism in Hebrews” in Richard J. Bauckham et al. (eds.), The Epistle to the Hebrews and Christian Theology (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2009), 151–173, esp. 151–152, 167. A common device in science fiction is for robots, computers, and other artificial life to refer to themselves in the third person, e.g. \\"This unit is malfunctioning\\" or \\"Number Five is alive\\" (said by Johnny Five in Short Circuit), to suggest that these creatures are not truly self-aware, or that they separate their consciousness from their physical form. Illeism may also be used to show idiocy, as with the character Mongo in Blazing Saddles, e.g. \\"Mongo like candy\\" and \\"Mongo only pawn in game of life\\"; though it may also show innocent simplicity, as it does with Harry Potter's Dobby the Elf (\\"Dobby has come to protect, even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door\\"). In everyday speech Illeism in everyday speech can have a variety of intentions depending on context. One common usage is to impart humility, a common practice in feudal societies and other societies where honorifics are important to observe (\\"Your servant awaits your orders\\"), as well as in Master–Slave relationships (\\"This slave needs to be punished\\"). Recruits in the military, mostly United States Marine Corps recruits, are also often made to refer to themselves in the third person, such as \\"this recruit\\", in order to reduce the sense of individuality and enforce the idea of the group being more important than the self. The use of illeism in this context imparts a sense of lack of self, implying a diminished importance of the speaker in relation to the addressee or to a larger whole. Conversely, in different contexts, illeism can be used to reinforce self-promotion, as used to sometimes comic effect by Bob Dole throughout his political career (\\"When the president is ready to deploy, Bob Dole is ready to lead the fight on the Senate Floor\\", Bob Dole speaking about the Strategic Defense Initiative at the NCPAC convention, 1987). This was particularly made notable during the United States presidential election of 1996 and lampooned broadly in popular media for years afterwards. Deepanjana Pal of Firstpost noted that speaking in the third person \\"is a classic technique used by generations of Bollywood scriptwriters to establish a character's aristocracy, power and gravitas\\". On the other hand, third person self-referral can be associated with self-irony and not taking oneself too seriously (since the excessive use of pronoun \\"I\\" is often seen as a sign of narcissism and egocentrism), as well as with eccentricity in general. Psychological studies show that thinking and speaking of oneself in the third person increases wisdom and has a positive effect on one's mental state because an individual who does so is more intellectually humble, more capable of empathy and understanding the perspectives of others, and is able to distance emotionally from one's own problems. Accordingly, in certain Eastern religions, like Hinduism, illeism is sometimes seen as a sign of enlightenment, since through it, an individual detaches his eternal self (atman) from his bodily form; in particular, Jnana yoga encourages its practitioners to refer to themselves in the third person. Known illeists of that sort include Swami Ramdas, Ma Yoga Laxmi, Anandamayi Ma, and Mata Amritanandamayi. A number of celebrities, including Marilyn Monroe, Alice Cooper, and Deanna DurbinPrivate letter to film historian/critic William K. Everson in the late 1970s, referred to themselves in the third person to distance their public persona from their actual self. Young children in Japan commonly refer to themselves by their own name. This is due to the Japanese way of speaking, in which referring to another in the third person is considered more polite than using any of the Japanese words for \\"you\\". As a Japanese child grows older they normally switch to using first person references. Japanese idols also may refer to themselves in the third person so to give off the feeling of childlike cuteness.

He was the son of the pioneering film producer Jules Greenbaum who had founded Deutsche Bioscope. He began as a cameraman in 1915 working on German silent movies, especially in association with directors Urban Gad, Max Mack, and Franz Hofer. Most of the time he worked for his father's company Greenbaum- Film GmbH in Berlin, even directing some detective films around 1920. His career continued into the sound era and he moved to England working on such films as The Stars Look Down (1940), Hatter's Castle (1942), Thunder Rock (1942), So Evil My Love (1948), Night and the City (1950) and I'm All Right Jack (1959), usually credited as Max Greene. He directed a few British films in the 1940s, but is remembered today for the over 150 films as a director of photography between 1915 and 1967.

It is situated about south of Adyar. It is bordered on two sides by the Old Mahabalipuram Road and the Perungudi lake. It is situated on the Old Mahabalipuram IT Expressway right in middle of an Information Technology (IT) Estate. It is between Taramani and Thoraipakkam and parallel to Kottivakkam and Palavakkam in the East Coast Road (ECR Highway). The suburb is inhabited by an equal mix of new migrants and descendants of some early clans who migrated to the area approximately 300 years ago. Perungudi is seeing heightened activities in recent years due to its strategic location. The population of Perungudi was approximately 8,000 in 2000 but has grown significantly in the years since then. Being in the IT Corridor of Chennai, Perungudi is increasingly being preferred as a residential locality by software engineers. Despite this significant growth, Perungudi lacks basic civic amenities such as underground storm and waste drainage system, piped potable water and good roads.. This region has gained more importance owing to its location on the IT highway and proximity to city neighbourhoods like Thiruvanmiyur, Adyar and Velachery. Geography Road to Perungudi Railway station Perungudi is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Perungudi It has an average elevation of 9 metres (29 feet). As of 2018, the Perungudi zone had the lowest green cover estimate at 5.31 percent, as against the city's 14.9 percent average. Demographics India census, Perungudi had a population of 23,481. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Perungudi has an average literacy rate of 72%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 77%, and female literacy is 65%. In Perungudi, 12% of the population is under 6 years of age.  Economy  Perungudi has developed from a small village to a vibrant and thriving commercial / residential hub after the boom in the Indian IT industry. IT companies like Amazon company, news channel Thanthi TV & many more IT companies are present here. Organic shop like Standard Cold Pressed Oil & other food outlets are present here. Perungudi had developed an industrial estate in the 90's. It is still struggling with poor infrastructure for decades despite boasting offices of some the biggest IT companies in India.  Dump Yard  Perungudi houses one of the two major landfills in Chennai. The dump yard is constantly in the news for the burning of garbage despite it being banned. The dump yard also spills into the pallikarnai marshland which is home to a lot of local and migratory birds. The plans to close the dumpyard by the corporation have not yet been implemented.  Administrative Panchayat= In 2011 Perungudi Town Panchayat was merged with Chennai Corporation. =Elections= Although the Panchayat presidential elections are nominally held once every five years, no elections were held for a period of 15 years between 1979 and 1994. later in 1996 election was conducted, KP.KANDHAN was (Thalaivar (1996-2011)) and GM.JANAKIRAMAN was (Thunai Thalaivar(1996-2006).and T.SRINIVASAN was (Thunai Thalaivar (2006-2011). Under DMK period Chennai is extended a few kilometers, so PERUNGUDI Panchayat comes under CHENNAI CORPORATION ward 186 (out of 200). GM.JANAKIRAMAN was the first councilor for Perungudi after the conversion from Panchayat to Chennai corporation. =Metropolitan Transport Corporation= Perungudi train station The \\"Metropolitan Transport Corporation\\" (\\"MTC\\" from P(pallavan)TC) connects Perungudi to transit points like Saidapet, Adayar, and Tiruvanmiyur.

It can be used by any entity to evaluate impact on stakeholders, identify ways to improve performance, and enhance the performance of investments. The SROI method as it has been standardized by the Social Value UK provides a consistent quantitative approach to understanding and managing the impacts of a project, business, organisation, fund or policy. It accounts for stakeholders' views of impact, and puts financial 'proxy' values on all those impacts identified by stakeholders which do not typically have market values. The aim is to include the values of people that are often excluded from markets in the same terms as used in markets, that is money, in order to give people a voice in resource allocation decisions. Some SROI users employ a version of the method that does not require that all impacts be assigned a financial proxy. Instead the \\"numerator\\" includes monetized, quantitative but not monetized, qualitative, and narrative types of information about value. A network was formed in 2008 to facilitate the continued evolution of the method. Some 2000 globally are members of this network called Social Value International (formerly the SROI Network).  Development  While the term SROI exists in Cost–benefit analysis, a methodology for calculating social return on investment in the context of social enterprise was first documented in 2000 by REDF (formerly the Roberts Enterprise Development Fund), a San Francisco-based philanthropic fund that makes long-term grants to organizations that run businesses for social benefit. Since then the approach has evolved to take into account developments in corporate sustainability reporting as well as development in the field of accounting for social and environmental impact. Interest has been fuelled by the increasing recognition of the importance of metrics to manage impacts that are not included in traditional profit and loss accounts, and the need for these metrics to focus on outcomes over outputs. While SROI builds upon the logic of cost-benefit analysis, it is different in that it is explicitly designed to inform the practical decision-making of enterprise managers and investors focused on optimizing their social and environmental impacts. By contrast, cost-benefit analysis is a technique rooted in social science that is most often used by funders outside an organization to determine whether their investment or grant is economically efficient, although economic efficiency also encompasses social and environmental considerations. In 2002, the Hewlett Foundation's Blended Value Project was brought forward by a group of practitioners from the US, Canada, UK and Netherlands who had been implementing SROI analyses together to draft an update to the methodology. A member of this group coauthored a guidance-style article in the California Management Review on the subject around this time. A larger group met again in 2006 to do another revision which was published in 2006 in the book Social Return on Investment: a Guide to SROI. New Economics Foundation in the UK began exploring ways in which SROI could be tested and developed in a UK context, publishing a DIY Guide to Social Return on Investment in 2007. The UK government's Office of the Third Sector and the Scottish Government commissioned a project beginning in 2007 that continues to develop guidelines that allow social businesses seeking government grants to account for their impact using a consistent, verifiable method. This resulted in another formal revision to the method, produced by a consortium led by the Social Value UK, published in the 2009 Guide to SROI. The Social Value UK website Developments in the UK led to agreement between the Social Value International and the Social Value UK on core principles. These are: * Involve stakeholders. * Understand what changes. * Value the things that matter. * Only include what is material. * Do not over-claim. * Be transparent. * Verify the result. 'Value the things that matter' includes the use of financial proxies and monetisation of value and is unique to the SROI approach. These seven principles were renamed \\"Social Value Principles\\" by Social Value International in 2017, and guidance standards for each are being produced. Several software providers exist to support users to collect and manage data for SROI analysis. Since 2008 Social E-valuator from The Netherlands have been working on solutions for impact measurement. In 2013 Social E-valuator built a brand new online software platform for measuring impact and late 2014 they have launched an inclusive impact measurement platform called Sinzer.The website of Sinzer, online platform for measuring impact This enables people to map impact, collect data in an efficient way and analyze the results. The online tool from Sinzer is created in such a way that organizations can make better decisions, improve impact and be accountable to stakeholders. Social Asset Measurements Inc.,Social Asset Measurements Inc. a Canadian software and consulting company, developed the Social Return Intelligence Suite, which is made up of two interlinked software products: The Ira Impact Reporting & Management Suite (IIRM) and the Sabita Indicator & Financial Proxy Database Service (SDS). Sabita was created with funding from the National Research Council of Canada and houses over 500 indicators and financial proxies, which are adjusted for inflation and graded according to the SAM Factor – a proprietary algorithm that provides a grading from 0-10 based on the quality of the sources used in creating the financial proxy. Ira allows non-SROI practitioners to report within the SROI framework, creating monetized and non- monetized impact reports, as well as outcome and output reports. In 2009–2010 proponents affiliated with the Social Value UK proposed to establish linkages between SROI analysis and IRIS,IRIS: Impact Reporting and Investment Standards an initiative to create a common set of terms and definitions for describing the social and environmental performance of an organization. Some organisations that have used SROI have found it to be a useful tool for organizational learning.  Primary purpose  While in financial management the term ROI refers to a single ratio, unlike Social Earnings Ratio (S/E Ratio), SROI analysis does not necessarily refer not to one single ratio but more to a way of reporting on value creation. It bases the assessment of value in part on the perception and experience of stakeholders, finds indicators of what has changed and tells the story of this change and, where possible, uses monetary values for these indicators. It is an emerging management discipline: a skill set for the measurement and communication of non-financial value. Therefore, the approach distinguishes between \\"SROI\\" and \\"SROI Analysis.\\" The latter implies: a) a specific process by which the number was calculated, b) context information to enable accurate interpretation of the number itself, and c) additional non-monetized social value and information about the number's substance and context.How Has SROI Helped Me?  The principles  There are seven principles of SROI.A Guide to Social Return on Investment, Society Media (2009) p. 9Social Return on Investment Position Paper, New Philanthropy Capital (2010) p. 2 These are: ; 1. Involve stakeholders (i.e. everyone who has a 'stake' or an interest in the subject of the SROI) : Inform what gets measured and how this is measured and valued in an account of social value by involving stakeholders ; 2. Understand what changes (for those stakeholders) : Articulate how change is created and evaluate this through evidence gathered, recognising positive and negative changes as well as those that are intended and unintended ; 3. Value what matters (also known as the 'monetisation principle' – see below) : Making decisions about allocating resources between different options needs to recognise the values of stakeholders. Value refers to the relative importance of different outcomes. It is informed by stakeholders' preferences ; 4. Only include what is material : Determine what information and evidence must be included in the accounts to give a true and fair picture, such that stakeholders can draw reasonable conclusions about impact ; 5. Do not over-claim : Only claim the value that activities are responsible for creating ; 6. Be transparent : Demonstrate the basis on which the analysis may be considered accurate and honest, and show that it will be reported to and discussed with stakeholders ; 7. Verify the result : Ensure appropriate independent assurance = Monetisation principle = The translation of extra-financial value into monetary terms is considered an important part of SROI analysis by some practitioners, and problematic when it is made a universal requirement by others. Essentially, the monetisation principle assumes that price is a proxy for value. While prices represent exchange value – the market price at which demand equals supply – they do not completely represent all the value to either the seller or the consumer. In other words, they do not capture economic surplus (consumer or producer surplus). They also do not include the positive or negative value (i.e., externalities) for others who may be affected by an exchange. Moreover, prices will depend in part on the distribution of income and wealth: different distributions result in different prices which result in different proxies for value. Hence market prices do not always accurately reflect what people value. Proponents of SROI argue that using monetary proxies (market prices or other monetary proxies) for social, economic and environmental value offers several practical benefits: * it makes it easier to align and integrate performance management systems with financial management systems; * it aids communication with internal stakeholders, especially those responsible for finances and resource allocation, and with those who prefer quantitative to qualitative ways of learning; * it induces transparency since it precipitates the clarification of which values have been included and which have not been included; * it permits sensitivity analysis to show which assumptions are more important in that the result is more affected by changes in some assumptions than others; * it helps identify the critical sources of value and so streamlines performance management. Despite these benefits, on the con side there is concern that monetization lets the consumer of SROI analysis off the hook by too easily allowing comparison of the end number at the expense of understanding the actual method by which it was arrived at—a comparison which would be an apples to oranges comparison in nearly every case. The SROI methodology has been further adapted for use in planning and prioritization of climate change adaptation and development interventions. For example, the Participatory Social Return on Investment (PSROI) framework builds on the economic principles of SROI and CBA and integrates them with the theoretical and methodological foundations of Participatory Action Research (PAR), Critical systems thinking, and Resilience Theory and strength-based approaches such as Appreciative Inquiry and asset-based community development to create a framework for the planning and costing of adaptation to climate change in agricultural systems Sova C, Chaudhury A, Helfgott A, Corner-Dolloff C (2012). \\"Community-based adaptation costing: An integrated framework for the participatory costing of community-based adaptations to climate change in agriculture\\", Working Paper No. 16., CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11027-014-9600-5Further applications Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS): Cali, Colombia. PSROI thus represents the convergence of two theoretical tracks: Adaptation prioritization, planning and selection, and the economics of adaptation. The main divergence, then, between SROI and PSROI is that while SROI typically analyzes pre-defined interventions, PSROI involves a participatory intervention prioritization process that is antecedent to SROI-style economic analyses.  Potential limitations  * Benefits that cannot be monetised: There will be some benefits that are important to stakeholders but which cannot be monetised.Social Return on Investment Position Paper, New Philanthropy Capital (2010) p. 6 An SROI analysis should not be restricted to one number, but seen as a framework for exploring an organisation’s social impact, in which monetisation plays an important but not an exclusive role. * Focus on monetisation: One of the dangers of SROI is that people may focus on monetisation without following the rest of the process, which is crucial to proving and improving.Arvidson et al (2010) The Ambitions and Challenges of SROI. TSRC Working Paper 49, pp. 9-10 Moreover, an organisation must be clear about its mission and values and understand how its activities change the world – not only what it does but also what difference it makes. This clarity informs stakeholder engagement. Therefore, if an organisation seeks to monetise its impact without having considered its mission and stakeholders, then it risks choosing inappropriate indicators; and as a result the SROI calculations can be of limited use or even misconstrued. * Needs considerable capacity: SROI is time- and resource-intensive.SROI Act II: A Call to Action for Next Generation SROI. Gair, C (2009) REDF pp. 6-7.Millar & Hall (2012) Social Return on Investment (SROI) and Performance Measurement. In Public Management Review, DOI:10.1080/14719037.2012.698857, p.12 It is most easily used when an organisation is already measuring the direct and longer-term results of its work with people, groups, or the environment. * Some outcomes not easily associated with monetary value: Some outcomes and impacts (for example, increased self-esteem, improved family relationships) cannot be easily associated with a monetary value. In order to incorporate these benefits into the SROI ratio proxies for these values would be required. SROI analysis is a developing areaArvidson et al (2010) The Ambitions and Challenges of SROI. TSRC Working Paper 49, p. 3 and as SROI evolves it is possible that methods of monetising more outcomes will become available and that there will be increasing numbers of people using the same proxies. * Exaggerating the result: When participants expect SROI greater than 100% and when the observation coverage involves a huge project with numerous stakeholders, who genuinely believe the result was greater by minimizing the contributions of their partner.

She was the first woman to hold a cabinet-level ministerial portfolio in Australia, and served as a minister for the duration of the Fraser Government. Guilfoyle was successively Minister for Education (1975), Minister for Social Security (1975–1980), and Minister for Finance (1980–1983). She worked as an accountant before entering politics, and in retirement held various positions in the public and non- profit sectors. Early life Guilfoyle was born Margaret Georgina Constance McCartney on 15 May 1926 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. She was the second of three children born to Elizabeth Jane (née Ellis) and William McCartney; her father worked as a civil servant and her mother was a schoolteacher before her marriage. The family immigrated to Australia in 1928, settling in Melbourne. Her father died when she was ten, after which she and her siblings were raised solely by their mother; they had no other relatives in Australia. Guilfoyle later recalled that her mother's experiences led her to realise \\"that, at any time, a woman must be capable of independence\\". Guilfoyle began her education at the local state school in Fairfield, then attended a business college until the age of 15. She later took night classes while working as a secretary, studying accountancy at Taylors Institute of Advanced Studies and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. Guilfoyle eventually qualified as an accountant and chartered secretary, and in 1947 became the head accountant at Overseas Corporation Australia Ltd, an export firm. She later went into private practice in order to spend more time with her family. Politics Guilfoyle joined the Liberal Party in the early 1950s. She was mentored by Elizabeth Couchman and Senator Ivy Wedgwood, who encouraged her to seek leadership positions within the party's organisational wing. In 1967, with their support, Guilfoyle was chosen as chairman of the state women's section and elected to the state executive. She also served as a delegate to the Federal Council. When Wedgwood announced her retirement, she endorsed Guilfoyle as her successor. She subsequently won preselection for the Senate against 20 male candidates, and was elected in second place on the Coalition's ticket in Victoria at the 1970 half-Senate election. =Senate= Guilfoyle's first term in the Senate began on 1 July 1971. She was re-elected to additional terms in 1974, 1975, and 1980, retiring on 5 June 1987 at the end of her final term. When she began her political career, she and Senator Nancy Buttfield were the only women in parliament; the House of Representatives had no female members. Guilfoyle was Australia's seventh female senator and the third from Victoria, after Wedgwood and Marie Breen. Over the course of her career, an additional 19 women were elected to the Senate. Soon after taking her seat, Guilfoyle joined the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. As part of the latter, in December 1973 she joined Ellis Lawrie and Bob Cotton in submitting a minority report that advocated the abolition of inheritance tax; their recommendations were eventually adopted almost a decade later. Guilfoyle was appointed to the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Ownership and Control of Australian Resources in 1972, and the following year joined the Joint Committee on Prices. The Herald described her as \\"a housewife with a big say on prices\\", while The Sunday Telegraph reported that she would be \\"looked upon by Australian housewives as their special friend in Canberra\\". She in fact took pains to avoid being pigeonholed as a spokesperson for women. According to her biographer Margaret Fitzherbert, her choices of committee \\"reflected her professional interests and experience, and, in sidestepping committees that were overtly concerned with family issues, marked her apart from the women who had preceded her in parliament\\". =Government minister= In June 1974, Guilfoyle was appointed to Billy Snedden's shadow ministry as the Coalition's spokesperson for the media. She supported Malcolm Fraser in the March 1975 leadership spill, and when he was successful she was moved to the higher-profile education portfolio. Following the dismissal of the Whitlam Government in November 1975, Guilfoyle was appointed Minister for Education in Fraser's caretaker ministry. This made her the first woman to hold a cabinet- level ministerial portfolio;\\"Senator Margaret Guilfoyle is the first woman to be appointed to a Cabinet portfolio following her appointment as Minister for Education in the first Fraser government in 1975.\\" she was the second woman appointed to cabinet, after Enid Lyons, and the second to be given a ministerial portfolio, after Annabelle Rankin. In December 1975, following the Coalition's victory at the 1975 election, Guilfoyle was appointed Minister for Social Security in the second Fraser Ministry. Her new portfolio was initially placed outside of cabinet, but she was reinstated in July 1976 after Ivor Greenwood's retirement. According to Fraser, she \\"contributed significantly to cabinet debates ... she could be totally relied on and she could think for herself – she wasn't a captive to the bureaucracy\\". In the social security portfolio, Guilfoyle was seen as skilful in balancing political and financial considerations. She strongly resisted pressure to cut her department's budget, arguing that regular increases were needed simply to maintain existing programs. She believed any cuts would be unpopular with both the general public and her party's backbenchers, and there was no guarantee that they would pass the Senate. Fraser agreed with her rationale, and in 1979 she secured a \\"sizeable increase\\" in her department's budget. She had an often tense relationship with Treasurer Phillip Lynch, who complained to Fraser that she was the most uncooperative minister in identifying potential spending cuts. During her tenure, Guilfoyle oversaw a major reform of the national child endowment scheme, introducing direct cash payments rather than tax rebates. She helped establish it as a permanent measure, renaming it the \\"family allowance\\", and resisted calls to introduce means-testing. As well as running her own department, Guilfoyle was also placed in charge of the new Office of Child Care within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Working with Marie Coleman as the office's director, she oversaw a major enlargement of the federal government's activities in the childcare sector, introducing or expanding funding for preschool, daycare, after-school care, and youth refuges. After the 1980 election, Guilfoyle was appointed Minister for Finance, effectively becoming the deputy to Treasurer John Howard. She viewed her position as that of \\"chief accountant for the country\\". Beginning with the 1981–82 budget, government ministers were required to take budget submissions to Guilfoyle for approval. That role had previously been filled by the Expenditure Review Committee (ERC), a panel of five ministers. Under the new arrangement, the ERC only reviewed submissions if a minister had failed to come to an agreement with Guilfoyle. She was a key member of the Review of Commonwealth Functions Committee, a cabinet subcommittee nicknamed the \\"razor gang\\" that was tasked with cutting government expenditure. Its report, handed down in April 1981, recommended that hundreds of functions and programs be abolished, reduced, or transferred to state governments. Guilfoyle remained finance minister until the government's defeat at the 1983 election. She was made spokesperson for finance and taxation in Andrew Peacock's shadow ministry, but resigned the position after the 1984 election and spent her remaining years in the Senate as a backbencher. Later life After leaving the Senate, Guilfoyle obtained a Bachelor of Laws degree from the Australian National University (ANU). In 1990, she was nominated by the Hawke Government as a member of the National Inquiry Into the Human Rights of People with Mental Illness, which issued its report in 1993. She later served as chair of the Judicial Remuneration Tribunal from 1995 to 2001. As well as her public- sector appointments, Guilfoyle also served on the boards of a number of non- profit organisations, including the Australian Children's Television Foundation, the Victorian State Opera, the Mental Health Research Institute, and the Infertility Treatment Authority. She was president of the board of management of Royal Melbourne Hospital from 1993 to 1995. In 2001, she and Joan Kirner led a campaign to secure more nominations for women in the Australian honours system. Guilfoyle remained involved with the Liberal Party after leaving parliament. In 1993, she was briefly a candidate for federal president, the titular head of the party's organisational wing. She had the support of Jeff Kennett and Andrew Peacock, but withdrew from the race in favour of Malcolm Fraser; the successful candidate was Tony Staley, another of her cabinet colleagues. Later that year, she was appointed chair of the Liberal Women's Candidates Forum, which was set up by John Hewson to encourage women to run for office as Liberal candidates. Personal life Guilfoyle's husband is Stanley Guilfoyle, whom she married on 20 November 1952. The couple had two daughters and a son together. Her husband worked as an accountant and company director, as well as being involved with the organisational wing of the Victorian Liberals. He was a director of 3XY, a radio station linked to the party, and was a founding director of the Cormack Foundation. In 1976, Mungo MacCallum published an article in Nation Review alleging that Guilfoyle was having an extramarital affair with Jim Killen, one of her cabinet colleagues. Oblique references to the rumours had also been made in other publications. She and Killen sued for defamation, and obtained an injunction against further publication.

It is continued today by Bunny Hoest and John Reiner. Characters and story The married couple Leroy and Loretta Lockhorn constantly argue. They demonstrate their mutual deep-seated hatred by making humorously sarcastic comments on each other's failings as spouses. The strip initially was titled The Lockhorns of Levittown, and many of the businesses and institutions depicted in the strip are real places located in or near Huntington, New York, on the North Shore of Long Island. \\"When we use names, we get permission,\\" Bunny Hoest said in 2019. “Dr. [Harold] Blog was our doctor for many years. He passed away. We still use him. He stays alive in the comic.\\" Anticipating national syndication, Bunny Hoest suggested shortening the title to The Lockhorns. It began as a single-panel daily on September 9, 1968, with the Sunday feature launched April 9, 1972. The Sunday feature employs an unusual layout that ganged together several single-panel cartoons. Comics historian Don Markstein described the couple's battle of wits: Bill Hoest died in 1988. His widow, Bunny Hoest, continued the strip with Bill Hoest's longtime assistant, John Reiner.

The Lockhorns appeared as The Hateeachothers, depicting a non-plussed Leeroy Hateeachother comparing the monstrous ant to Loretta's mother. *A Watch Your Head comic featured a movie trailer \\"Dear Loretta, Love, Leroy\\" where the bickering turns out to be a romantic comedy.

The David L. Lawrence Convention Center (DLLCC) is a convention, conference and exhibition building in downtown Pittsburgh in the U.S. commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It is served by two exits on Interstate 579. The initial David L. Lawrence Convention Center was completed on the site on February 7, 1981, but as part of a renewal plan the new, completely redesigned center was opened in 2003 and funded in conjunction with nearby Heinz Field and PNC Park. It sits on the southern shoreline of the Allegheny River. It is the first LEED-certified convention center in North America and one of the first in the world. It is owned by the Sports & Exhibition Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. History In the early 1970s a site on the opposite side of Downtown Pittsburgh was considered for a modern convention center, on the shores of the Monongahela River. On September 20, 1971 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania failed to approve that location, and site work slowly began on the present site as the city and county submitted it to the commonwealth on December 10, 1974. There was a proposal in mid-1974 to locate the center at the then transitioning Penn Station. The center had its ceremonial groundbreaking on June 8, 1977. On February 7, 1981 the original $35 million ($ million today) structure opened with a ribbon cutting ceremony by Mayor Richard Caliguiri, County Commissioner Tom Foerster and Governor Dick Thornburgh. After the Commonwealth approved funding for the redesigned center on February 3, 1999 Rafael Viñoly Architects, P.C. was chosen as the designer for the modern center on February 28, 1999. Viñoly along with Dewhurst MacFarlane & Partners and Goldreich Engineering P.C. constructed the $354 million ($ million today) riverfront landmark to contain of exhibit space ( of which is column-free), of additional exhibit space, a ballroom, 51 meeting rooms, two 250-seat lecture halls, teleconference and telecommunications capabilities and of retail space (currently in development). The architect, Viñoly, began the design with a goal in mind of achieving the status of a \\"green\\" building. In 2003, the building was awarded Gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification by the U.S. Green Building Council, making it the first such convention center in the U.S. and the largest \\"green\\" building in the world. The current building replaced the former convention center of the same name that was constructed in 1981. The old convention center was and lacked a ballroom. All of the old building was demolished to make way for the current structure which was built on the same site. The building won the 2004 Supreme Award for structural engineering excellence from the Institution of Structural Engineers. The convention center is home to prominent conventions, such as Anthrocon, the Pittsburgh RV Show, Pittsburgh Boat Show, Pittsburgh Home and Garden Show, Piratefest, and the acclaimed Pittsburgh International Auto Show. Naming The center—though completely a structure of 2003 construction—chose to retain the name of the earlier convention center on the site completed in 1981 in honor of David Leo Lawrence (June 18, 1889 – November 21, 1966). Lawrence was an American politician who served as the Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania from 1959 to 1963, only retiring because of the state's then term limit of 1 per governor. He is to date the only mayor of Pittsburgh to be elected Governor of Pennsylvania. Previously, he had been the longest tenured mayor of Pittsburgh (1946–1959) and the primary force behind Pittsburgh's urban renewal projects including the Mellon Arena, Gateway Center, Fort Pitt Tunnel and Point State Park. He was Pennsylvania's first Catholic Governor (at the time a major breakthrough for an Irish Catholic), and a major force in the national Democratic Party from the 1930s to the 1960s. Historians credit him with among other behind-the-scenes labors, leading a compromise at the 1944 National Democratic Convention that eventually made Harry Truman president. As well as healing a divided national convention of 1960 that resulted in the John F. Kennedy/Lyndon B. Johnson ticket, it is for these reasons as well as his work in the state and the city that he was dubbed \\"kingmaker\\" by party leaders.

Sesquilé in the Chibcha language of the Muisca means \\"hot water\\". Official website Sesquilé - accessed 06-05-2016 Sesquilé is adjacent to Tominé Reservoir and nearby Lake Guatavita, the suspected site of the El Dorado legend.  Tourism  *Laguna del cacique Guatavita, a beautiful, ecologically pristine mountaintop lake well inside paramo altitude, it is one of the places contesting being the location for the legend of El Dorado. It is believed (by some) that its bottom is covered in large quantities of gold, due to the story of a ceremony performed on and in its waters. It is said that each cacique, at the beginning of his reign, was covered in gold dust and ritually rafted to the middle of the lake, where he swam to bathe the heavy gold off, then made offerings of riches in gold works. Though tentative evidence exists for such ceremony, in the form of the pre- Columbian gold sculpture (1 ft x 6in x 1 ft) of the raft with a cacique and priests astride it, currently kept at the Gold Museum, Bogota, it is very likely the only evidence, so that the ceremony itself remains the stuff of legend. At least one search with SCUBA gear has been attempted, with unsuccessful results due to the murkiness, great depth and dangerously low temperature of the water. Swimming in the lake is not advisable, for ecological as well as the obvious medical reasons. Hiking trails are available and camping is possible (open fires are forbidden), but it is best to check with the local police to make sure it is safe at the time (due to the ever- present guerrilla situation in the country) and so that the authorities are advised as to where hikers are going in case they have trouble returning, for whatever reason. * Arts and crafts: woolen clothing * Caminos Reales: ancient trails of the Muiscas, now rehabilitated for hiking * Cañón de Las Águilas (river gorge) * Capilla de Los Dolores: beautiful chapel of colonial architecture which has been well preserved and keeps its original masonry and ornamentation intact * Cerro de Covadonga (mountain) * Cerro de Las Tres Viejas (mountain): the three summits where known by the pre-Columbian natives as Chía, Vitaca and Quemuenchatocha, it is one of the places in the region most imbued in history and legend * Cerro Pan de Azúcar (mountain) * Club Náutico La Marina de Guatavita (nautical club at Tominé Lake) * Tominé Dam & Lake, it stocks around 600 million cubic meters of water for consumption mainly in Bogotá.

Polley is recognised for her efforts to increase palliative care funding, arguing that: I will continue to fight for and support those lobbying for better palliative care services across Tasmania so that Tasmanians who receive palliative care receive the best possible care. I would expect that all members in their respective states would do the same. Dying is a natural part of life. It is not a taboo subject and should not be treated as such. Our culture must reflect this. Our attitude should support a natural and dignified death, which is possible with advance care planning and a first-rate palliative care system.Senate, Matters of Public Interest Speech, Palliative Care 2013, http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber%2Fhansards%2F76276f2a-f60c-4fe4-9657-01d4dad8287a%2F0035;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2F76276f2a-f60c-4fe4-9657-01d4dad8287a%2F0000%22 Polley believes that body image and the way teenagers are viewing themselves is a matter of public health, which needs all Australia's attention.Senate, Matters of Public Interest Speech, Healthy Body Image 2012 http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber%2Fhansards%2Fdcbf3820-67a9-494a-bf57-5efe0c27f413%2F0068;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2Fdcbf3820-67a9-494a-bf57-5efe0c27f413%2F0000%22 \\"Let's place ourselves at the forefront of the international push to require disclosure of digitally altered images in advertising not only as a matter of public health but also as a matter of protecting consumer rights to the accurate presentation of images in advertising.\\"Senate, Matters of Public Interest Speech, Healthy Body Image 2012 http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber%2Fhansards%2Fdcbf3820-67a9-494a-bf57-5efe0c27f413%2F0068;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2Fdcbf3820-67a9-494a-bf57-5efe0c27f413%2F0000%22 =Exchange with Andrew Bolt= In May 2013 Polley attracted the ire of conservative News Ltd columnist Andrew Bolt. Speaking in the Senate on the denigration of public debate in Australia, Polley noted that: It is not just the coalition's stance on key issues or mean-spirited political tactics that we should be concerned about. It is something even more fundamental: the denigration of political debate in Australia that is being driven by the opposition leader and his team. In America, this sort of shrill, fear-driven campaigning led to the tragic shooting of United States congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. How much further will the opposition leader go until his tactics lead to a similar disaster occurring in Australia? Already the political narrative, relentlessly pursued by the opposition leader and shadow Treasurer, has unleashed responses in some sections of the public that are honestly quite frightening. This can be largely attributed to the fact that coalition politicians are free to associate themselves with Tea Party style protests which place a premium on ignorance, and disregard informed decision or discussion of policy or leadership.http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber%2Fhansards%2Fa344915b-9c0f-488b-bba5-64b64aa396c0%2F0292;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2Fa344915b-9c0f-488b-bba5-64b64aa396c0%2F0000%22 The speech, which drew an angry response from numerous Coalition Senators in the chamber at the time, was also the focus of a furious blog entry from Bolt. Writing on 20 May, Bolt commented: Yes, hate-mongers of the Left - like Polley herself - did pretend Jared Loughner, the man who shot Giffords, was a Right- winger driven to violence by the political rhetoric of the Right, especially Sarah Palin. The truth is he was a nutter of the Left, if anything, who hated Giffords long before Palin made news:... Bolt also took aim at Polley's union membership, stating: Oh, and does this surprise you? Helen is a passionate member of the Australian Workers Union. What's her opinion of AWU officials who rip off their members, using, say, a slush fund set up by their lover?http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/the_vicious_ignorance_of_helen_polley/ Earlier that month, Polley had taken aim at Bolt in an ‘open letter’ posted on her website and Facebook page. Writing in response to an opinion piece that Bolt had written about the decision of the Gillard Government to increase the Medicare levy to fund the National Disability Inusrance Scheme, Polley argued that: There have been numerous occasions in which you have used your abrasive and far reaching column in News Limited publications to grossly misrepresent the truth and cynically exploit matters of public importance for your own purposes, but this time I think you have reached a new low. Your opinion piece on Thursday 2 May entitled ‘Why Should We Bail Her Out?’ was, quite simply, one of the most irresponsible and insincere examples of journalism I have ever witnessed. I think it is important that the Gillard Government's decision to raise the Medicare levy (levy, Mr Bolt, not a tax as you indicated several times) by 0.5 per cent to help fund DisabilityCare Australia is subject to open and rigorous debate. But this matter, which directly affects the lives of more than 400,000 people around Australia who have been waiting for years for such a reform, needs to be approached with diligence and care and you exhibited neither. Polley's response received a strong reaction on social media.https://www.facebook.com/pages/Senator-Helen-Polley/131323986885201 Political views Polley is a member of Labor's Unity faction.

Organisms that use osmotrophy are called osmotrophs. Some mixotrophic microorganisms use osmotrophy to derive some of their energy. Organisms that use osmotrophy include bacteria, many species of protists and most fungi. Some macroscopic animals like molluscs, sponges, corals, brachiopods and echinoderms may use osmotrophic feeding as a supplemental food source. Osmotrophy as a means of gathering nutrients in microscopic organisms relies on cellular surface area to ensure that proper diffusion of nutrients occurs into the cell. When organisms increase in size, the surface area per volume ratio drops and osmotrophy becomes insufficient to meet nutrient demands. Larger macroscopic organisms that rely on osmotrophy can compensate for a reduced surface area per volume ratio with a very flat, thin body. A tapeworm is an example of such adaptation. In stagnant waters photoautotrophs have a relative advantage over heterotrophic osmotrophs since the flux of photons as an energy source are not hindered at low temperatures, thus it depend on diffusion for mass acquisition through Brownian diffusion. Fluid motion is important for osmotrophs because asymptotic reactions occurs in the absence of fluid motion. Movement brings cell that correspond to the highest gradients though diffusional core is safe on average concentrations.

(1974).Variety film review; May 5, 1976, page 18. Like the previous film, That's Entertainment, Part II was a retrospective of famous films released by MGM from the 1930s to the 1950s. (Some posters for the film use Part 2 rather than Part II in the title.) For this second documentary, archivists featured more obscure musical numbers from MGM's vaults, and also featured tributes to some of the studio's best known comedy teams such as the Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy, romantic teams such as Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, and a montage of iconic stars such as Greta Garbo, Clark Gable, Mickey Rooney, John Barrymore, Wallace Beery, Joan Crawford, Jean Harlow, James Stewart and Lana Turner. Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire hosted the film and Kelly directed the introductory segments featuring him and Astaire, which included location footage of Kelly returning to Paris, the city featured in two of MGM's most famous productions, An American in Paris and Gigi. This was the last film Kelly directed. Several new musical numbers featured Astaire and Kelly, including a couple of routines in which they danced together for the first time since the 1946 film Ziegfeld Follies, and for only the second time in their careers. (It was the last time the 76-year-old Astaire danced in a film, though the veteran actor continued to make film and TV appearances until 1981; Kelly would last appear in the 1980 musical film Xanadu.) According to film historian Robert Osborne, in specially-filmed introductions produced for Turner Classic Movies, it was Astaire who suggested to Kelly that the two take advantage of this potentially last-in-a-lifetime opportunity to perform together, something Kelly actually wishes for out loud during his narration of the first That's Entertainment! film. The opening title sequence was designed by Saul Bass, and pays homage to the range and style of title sequences produced between the 1930s and early 1950s. The sequel received more critical acclaim, but was not as successful at the box-office as the first film. Some 18 years later it was followed by That's Entertainment! III, with Kelly once again appearing.

A polarizer or polariser is an optical filter that lets light waves of a specific polarization pass through while blocking light waves of other polarizations. It can filter a beam of light of undefined or mixed polarization into a beam of well-defined polarization, that is polarized light. The common types of polarizers are linear polarizers and circular polarizers. Polarizers are used in many optical techniques and instruments, and polarizing filters find applications in photography and LCD technology. Polarizers can also be made for other types of electromagnetic waves besides light, such as radio waves, microwaves, and X-rays.  Linear polarizers  Linear polarizers can be divided into two general categories: absorptive polarizers, where the unwanted polarization states are absorbed by the device, and beam-splitting polarizers, where the unpolarized beam is split into two beams with opposite polarization states. Polarizers which maintain the same axes of polarization with varying angles of incidence are often called Cartesian polarizers, since the polarization vectors can be described with simple Cartesian coordinates (for example, horizontal vs. vertical) independent from the orientation of the polarizer surface. When the two polarization states are relative to the direction of a surface (usually found with Fresnel reflection), they are usually termed s and p. This distinction between Cartesian and s–p polarization can be negligible in many cases, but it becomes significant for achieving high contrast and with wide angular spreads of the incident light. = Absorptive polarizers = Certain crystals, due to the effects described by crystal optics, show dichroism, preferential absorption of light which is polarized in particular directions. They can therefore be used as linear polarizers. The best known crystal of this type is tourmaline. However, this crystal is seldom used as a polarizer, since the dichroic effect is strongly wavelength dependent and the crystal appears coloured. Herapathite is also dichroic, and is not strongly coloured, but is difficult to grow in large crystals. A Polaroid polarizing filter functions similarly on an atomic scale to the wire-grid polarizer. It was originally made of microscopic herapathite crystals. Its current H-sheet form is made from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) plastic with an iodine doping. Stretching of the sheet during manufacture causes the PVA chains to align in one particular direction. Valence electrons from the iodine dopant are able to move linearly along the polymer chains, but not transverse to them. So incident light polarized parallel to the chains is absorbed by the sheet; light polarized perpendicularly to the chains is transmitted. The durability and practicality of Polaroid makes it the most common type of polarizer in use, for example for sunglasses, photographic filters, and liquid crystal displays. It is also much cheaper than other types of polarizer. A modern type of absorptive polarizer is made of elongated silver nano-particles embedded in thin (≤0.5 mm) glass plates. These polarizers are more durable, and can polarize light much better than plastic Polaroid film, achieving polarization ratios as high as 100,000:1 and absorption of correctly polarized light as low as 1.5%. Such glass polarizers perform best for short-wavelength infrared light, and are widely used in optical fiber communications. = Beam-splitting polarizers = Beam-splitting polarizers split the incident beam into two beams of differing linear polarization. For an ideal polarizing beamsplitter these would be fully polarized, with orthogonal polarizations. For many common beam-splitting polarizers, however, only one of the two output beams is fully polarized. The other contains a mixture of polarization states. Unlike absorptive polarizers, beam splitting polarizers do not need to absorb and dissipate the energy of the rejected polarization state, and so they are more suitable for use with high intensity beams such as laser light. True polarizing beamsplitters are also useful where the two polarization components are to be analyzed or used simultaneously.  Polarization by Fresnel reflection  A stack of plates at Brewster's angle to a beam reflects off a fraction of the s-polarized light at each surface, leaving a p-polarized beam. Full polarization at Brewster's angle requires many more plates than shown. The arrows indicate the direction of the electrical field, not the magnetic field, which is perpendicular to the electric field When light reflects (by Fresnel reflection) at an angle from an interface between two transparent materials, the reflectivity is different for light polarized in the plane of incidence and light polarized perpendicular to it. Light polarized in the plane is said to be p-polarized, while that polarized perpendicular to it is s-polarized. At a special angle known as Brewster's angle, no p-polarized light is reflected from the surface, thus all reflected light must be s-polarized, with an electric field perpendicular to the plane of incidence. A simple linear polarizer can be made by tilting a stack of glass plates at Brewster's angle to the beam. Some of the s-polarized light is reflected from each surface of each plate. For a stack of plates, each reflection depletes the incident beam of s-polarized light, leaving a greater fraction of p-polarized light in the transmitted beam at each stage. For visible light in air and typical glass, Brewster's angle is about 57°, and about 16% of the s-polarized light present in the beam is reflected for each air-to-glass or glass-to-air transition. It takes many plates to achieve even mediocre polarization of the transmitted beam with this approach. For a stack of 10 plates (20 reflections), about 3% (= (1-0.16)20) of the s-polarized light is transmitted. The reflected beam, while fully polarized, is spread out and may not be very useful. A more useful polarized beam can be obtained by tilting the pile of plates at a steeper angle to the incident beam. Counterintuitively, using incident angles greater than Brewster's angle yields a higher degree of polarization of the transmitted beam, at the expense of decreased overall transmission. For angles of incidence steeper than 80° the polarization of the transmitted beam can approach 100% with as few as four plates, although the transmitted intensity is very low in this case.Collett, Edward. Field Guide to Polarization, SPIE Field Guides vol. FG05, SPIE (2005) . Adding more plates and reducing the angle allows a better compromise between transmission and polarization to be achieved. unpolarized beam into one with a single linear polarization. Coloured arrows depict the electric field vector. The diagonally polarized waves also contribute to the transmitted polarization. Their vertical components are transmitted (shown), while the horizontal components are absorbed and reflected (not shown). Because their polarization vectors depend on incidence angle, polarizers based on Fresnel reflection inherently tend to produce s–p polarization rather than Cartesian polarization, which limits their use in some applications.  Birefringent polarizers  Other linear polarizers exploit the birefringent properties of crystals such as quartz and calcite. In these crystals, a beam of unpolarized light incident on their surface is split by refraction into two rays. Snell's law holds for both of these rays, the ordinary or o-ray, and the extraordinary or e-ray, with each ray experiencing a different index of refraction (this is called double refraction). In general the two rays will be in different polarization states, though not in linear polarization states except for certain propagation directions relative to the crystal axis. A Nicol prism A Nicol prism was an early type of birefringent polarizer, that consists of a crystal of calcite which has been split and rejoined with Canada balsam. The crystal is cut such that the o- and e-rays are in orthogonal linear polarization states. Total internal reflection of the o-ray occurs at the balsam interface, since it experiences a larger refractive index in calcite than in the balsam, and the ray is deflected to the side of the crystal. The e-ray, which sees a smaller refractive index in the calcite, is transmitted through the interface without deflection. Nicol prisms produce a very high purity of polarized light, and were extensively used in microscopy, though in modern use they have been mostly replaced with alternatives such as the Glan–Thompson prism, Glan–Foucault prism, and Glan–Taylor prism. These prisms are not true polarizing beamsplitters since only the transmitted beam is fully polarized. A Wollaston prism A Wollaston prism is another birefringent polarizer consisting of two triangular calcite prisms with orthogonal crystal axes that are cemented together. At the internal interface, an unpolarized beam splits into two linearly polarized rays which leave the prism at a divergence angle of 15°–45°. The Rochon and Sénarmont prisms are similar, but use different optical axis orientations in the two prisms. The Sénarmont prism is air spaced, unlike the Wollaston and Rochon prisms. These prisms truly split the beam into two fully polarized beams with perpendicular polarizations. The Nomarski prism is a variant of the Wollaston prism, which is widely used in differential interference contrast microscopy.  Thin film polarizers  Thin-film linear polarizers (also known as TFPN) are glass substrates on which a special optical coating is applied. Either Brewster's angle reflections or interference effects in the film cause them to act as beam-splitting polarizers. The substrate for the film can either be a plate, which is inserted into the beam at a particular angle, or a wedge of glass that is cemented to a second wedge to form a cube with the film cutting diagonally across the center (one form of this is the very common MacNeille cube). Thin-film polarizers generally do not perform as well as Glan-type polarizers, but they are inexpensive and provide two beams that are about equally well polarized. The cube-type polarizers generally perform better than the plate polarizers. The former are easily confused with Glan-type birefringent polarizers.  Wire-grid polarizers  One of the simplest linear polarizers is the wire-grid polarizer (WGP), which consists of many fine parallel metallic wires placed in a plane. WGPs mostly reflect the non- transmitted polarization and can thus be used as polarizing beam splitters. The parasitic absorption is relatively high compared to most of the dielectric polarizers though much lower than in absorptive polarizers. Electromagnetic waves that have a component of their electric fields aligned parallel to the wires will induce the movement of electrons along the length of the wires. Since the electrons are free to move in this direction, the polarizer behaves in a similar manner to the surface of a metal when reflecting light, and the wave is reflected backwards along the incident beam (minus a small amount of energy lost to Joule heating of the wire).Hecht, Eugene. Optics, 2nd ed., Addison Wesley (1990) . Chapter 8. For waves with electric fields perpendicular to the wires, the electrons cannot move very far across the width of each wire. Therefore, little energy is reflected and the incident wave is able to pass through the grid. In this case the grid behaves like a dielectric material. Overall, this causes the transmitted wave to be linearly polarized with an electric field completely perpendicular to the wires. The hypothesis that the waves \\"slip through\\" the gaps between the wires is incorrect. For practical purposes, the separation between wires must be less than the wavelength of the incident radiation. In addition, the width of each wire should be small compared to the spacing between wires. Therefore, it is relatively easy to construct wire-grid polarizers for microwaves, far- infrared, and mid-infrared radiation. In addition, advanced lithographic techniques can also build very tight pitch metallic grids, allowing for the polarization of visible light to a useful degree. Since the degree of polarization depends little on wavelength and angle of incidence, they are used for broad-band applications such as projection. Analytical solutions using rigorous coupled-wave analysis for wire grid polarizers have shown that for electric field components perpendicular to the wires, the medium behaves like a dielectric, and for electric field components parallel to the wires, the medium behaves like a metal (reflective).  Malus's law and other properties  Malus' Law where θ1 − θ0 = θi. non-dominant hand and use your dominant hand to insert third at 45°. Malus's law , which is named after Étienne-Louis Malus, says that when a perfect polarizer is placed in a polarized beam of light, the irradiance, I, of the light that passes through is given by : I = I_0 \\\\cos^2 \\\\theta_i, where I0 is the initial intensity and θi is the angle between the light's initial polarization direction and the axis of the polarizer. A beam of unpolarized light can be thought of as containing a uniform mixture of linear polarizations at all possible angles. Since the average value of \\\\cos^2 \\\\theta is 1/2, the transmission coefficient becomes : \\\\frac {I}{I_0} = \\\\frac {1}{2}. In practice, some light is lost in the polarizer and the actual transmission will be somewhat lower than this, around 38% for Polaroid-type polarizers but considerably higher (>49.9%) for some birefringent prism types. If two polarizers are placed one after another (the second polarizer is generally called an analyzer), the mutual angle between their polarizing axes gives the value of θ in Malus's law. If the two axes are orthogonal, the polarizers are crossed and in theory no light is transmitted, though again practically speaking no polarizer is perfect and the transmission is not exactly zero (for example, crossed Polaroid sheets appear slightly blue in colour). If a transparent object is placed between the crossed polarizers, any polarization effects present in the sample (such as birefringence) will be shown as an increase in transmission. This effect is used in polarimetry to measure the optical activity of a sample. Real polarizers are also not perfect blockers of the polarization orthogonal to their polarization axis; the ratio of the transmission of the unwanted component to the wanted component is called the extinction ratio, and varies from around 1:500 for Polaroid to about 1:106 for Glan–Taylor prism polarizers. In X-ray the Malus's law (relativistic form): : I=I_{0}\\\\frac{f}f_0\\\\left[1+\\\\frac{\\\\lambda(f_0-f)}{2c}\\\\right]\\\\cos^2\\\\theta_i where f_0 – frequency of the polarized radiation falling on the polarizer, f – frequency of the radiation passes through polarizer, \\\\lambda – Compton wavelength of electron, c – speed of light in vacuum.  Circular polarizers  Circular polarizers (CPL or circular polarizing filters) can be used to create circularly polarized light or alternatively to selectively absorb or pass clockwise and counter-clockwise circularly polarized light. They are used as polarizing filters in photography to reduce oblique reflections from non- metallic surfaces, and are the lenses of the 3D glasses worn for viewing some stereoscopic movies (notably, the RealD 3D variety), where the polarization of light is used to differentiate which image should be seen by the left and right eye. = Creating circularly polarized light = Circular polarizer creating left-handed circularly polarized light. It is considered left-handed as viewed from the receiver and right-handed as viewed from the source. There are several ways to create circularly polarized light, the cheapest and most common involves placing a quarter-wave plate after a linear polarizer and directing unpolarized light through the linear polarizer. The linearly polarized light leaving the linear polarizer is transformed into circularly polarized light by the quarter wave plate. The transmission axis of the linear polarizer needs to be half way (45°) between the fast and slow axes of the quarter-wave plate. In the arrangement above, the transmission axis of the linear polarizer is at a positive 45° angle relative to the right horizontal and is represented with an orange line. The quarter-wave plate has a horizontal slow axis and a vertical fast axis and they are also represented using orange lines. In this instance the unpolarized light entering the linear polarizer is displayed as a single wave whose amplitude and angle of linear polarization are suddenly changing. When one attempts to pass unpolarized light through the linear polarizer, only light that has its electric field at the positive 45° angle leaves the linear polarizer and enters the quarter-wave plate. In the illustration, the three wavelengths of unpolarized light represented would be transformed into the three wavelengths of linearly polarized light on the other side of the linear polarizer. Linearly polarized light, represented using components, entering a quarter-wave plate. The blue and green curves are projections of the red line on the vertical and horizontal planes respectively. In the illustration toward the right is the electric field of the linearly polarized light just before it enters the quarter-wave plate. The red line and associated field vectors represent how the magnitude and direction of the electric field varies along the direction of travel. For this plane electromagnetic wave, each vector represents the magnitude and direction of the electric field for an entire plane that is perpendicular to the direction of travel. (Refer to these two images in the plane wave article to better appreciate this.) Light and all other electromagnetic waves have a magnetic field which is in phase with, and perpendicular to, the electric field being displayed in these illustrations. To understand the effect the quarter-wave plate has on the linearly polarized light it is useful to think of the light as being divided into two components which are at right angles (orthogonal) to each other. Towards this end, the blue and green lines are projections of the red line onto the vertical and horizontal planes respectively and represent how the electric field changes in the direction of those two planes. The two components have the same amplitude and are in phase. Because the quarter-wave plate is made of a birefringent material, when in the wave plate, the light travels at different speeds depending on the direction of its electric field. This means that the horizontal component which is along the slow axis of the wave plate will travel at a slower speed than the component that is directed along the vertical fast axis. Initially the two components are in phase, but as the two components travel through the wave plate the horizontal component of the light drifts farther behind that of the vertical. By adjusting the thickness of the wave plate one can control how much the horizontal component is delayed relative to vertical component before the light leaves the wave plate and they begin again to travel at the same speed. When the light leaves the quarter- wave plate the rightward horizontal component will be exactly one quarter of a wavelength behind the vertical component making the light left-hand circularly polarized when viewed from the receiver. The top image is left-handed/counter- clockwise circularly polarized, as viewed from the receiver. The bottom image is that of linearly polarized light. The blue and green curves are projections of the red lines on the vertical and horizontal planes respectively. At the top of the illustration toward the right is the circularly polarized light after it leaves the wave plate. Directly below it, for comparison purposes, is the linearly polarized light that entered the quarter-wave plate. In the upper image, because this is a plane wave, each vector leading from the axis to the helix represents the magnitude and direction of the electric field for an entire plane that is perpendicular to the direction of travel. All the electric field vectors have the same magnitude indicating that the strength of the electric field does not change. The direction of the electric field however steadily rotates. The blue and green lines are projections of the helix onto the vertical and horizontal planes respectively and represent how the electric field changes in the direction of those two planes. Notice how the rightward horizontal component is now one quarter of a wavelength behind the vertical component. It is this quarter of a wavelength phase shift that results in the rotational nature of the electric field. It is significant to note that when the magnitude of one component is at a maximum the magnitude of the other component is always zero. This is the reason that there are helix vectors which exactly correspond to the maxima of the two components. Animation of left-handed/counter-clockwise circularly polarized light. (Left- handed as viewed from the receiver.) In the instance just cited, using the handedness convention used in many optics textbooks, the light is considered left-handed/counter-clockwise circularly polarized. Referring to the accompanying animation, it is considered left-handed because if one points one's left thumb against the direction of travel, ones fingers curl in the direction the electric field rotates as the wave passes a given point in space. The helix also forms a left-handed helix in space. Similarly this light is considered counter-clockwise circularly polarized because if a stationary observer faces against the direction of travel, the person will observe its electric field rotate in the counter-clockwise direction as the wave passes a given point in space.Refer to well referenced section in Circular Polarization article for a discussion of handedness. Left/Right Handedness To create right- handed, clockwise circularly polarized light one simply rotates the axis of the quarter-wave plate 90° relative to the linear polarizer. This reverses the fast and slow axes of the wave plate relative to the transmission axis of the linear polarizer reversing which component leads and which component lags. In trying to appreciate how the quarter-wave plate transforms the linearly polarized light, it is important to realize that the two components discussed are not entities in and of themselves but are merely mental constructs one uses to help appreciate what is happening. In the case of linearly and circularly polarized light, at each point in space, there is always a single electric field with a distinct vector direction, the quarter-wave plate merely has the effect of transforming this single electric field. = Absorbing and passing circularly polarized light = Circular polarizers can also be used to selectively absorb or pass right-handed or left-handed circularly polarized light. It is this feature which is utilized by the 3D glasses in stereoscopic cinemas such as RealD Cinema. A given polarizer which creates one of the two polarizations of light will pass that same polarization of light when that light is sent through it in the other direction. In contrast it will block light of the opposite polarization. Circular polarizer passing left-handed, counter-clockwise circularly polarized light. (Left-handed as viewed from the receiver.) The illustration above is identical to the previous similar one with the exception that the left-handed circularly polarized light is now approaching the polarizer from the opposite direction and linearly polarized light is exiting the polarizer toward the right. First note that a quarter- wave plate always transforms circularly polarized light into linearly polarized light. It is only the resulting angle of polarization of the linearly polarized light that is determined by the orientation of the fast and slow axes of the quarter-wave plate and the handedness of the circularly polarized light. In the illustration, the left-handed circularly polarized light entering the polarizer is transformed into linearly polarized light which has its direction of polarization along the transmission axis of the linear polarizer and it therefore passes. In contrast right-handed circularly polarized light would have been transformed into linearly polarized light that had its direction of polarization along the absorbing axis of the linear polarizer, which is at right angles to the transmission axis, and it would have therefore been blocked. Left-handed/Counter-Clockwise circularly polarized light displayed above linearly polarized light. The blue and green curves are projections of the helix on the vertical and horizontal planes respectively. To understand this process, refer to the illustration on the right. It is absolutely identical to the earlier illustration even though the circularly polarized light at the top is now considered to be approaching the polarizer from the left. One can observe from the illustration that the leftward horizontal (as observed looking along the direction of travel) component is leading the vertical component and that when the horizontal component is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength it will be transformed into the linearly polarized light illustrated at the bottom and it will pass through the linear polarizer. There is a relatively straightforward way to appreciate why a polarizer which creates a given handedness of circularly polarized light also passes that same handedness of polarized light. First, given the dual usefulness of this image, begin by imagining the circularly polarized light displayed at the top as still leaving the quarter-wave plate and traveling toward the left. Observe that had the horizontal component of the linearly polarized light been retarded by a quarter of wavelength twice, which would amount to a full half wavelength, the result would have been linearly polarized light that was at a right angle to the light that entered. If such orthogonally polarized light were rotated on the horizontal plane and directed back through the linear polarizer section of the circular polarizer it would clearly pass through given its orientation. Now imagine the circularly polarized light which has already passed through the quarter-wave plate once, turned around and directed back toward the circular polarizer again. Let the circularly polarized light illustrated at the top now represent that light. Such light is going to travel through the quarter-wave plate a second time before reaching the linear polarizer and in the process, its horizontal component is going to be retarded a second time by one quarter of a wavelength. Whether that horizontal component is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength in two distinct steps or retarded a full half wavelength all at once, the orientation of the resulting linearly polarized light will be such that it passes through the linear polarizer. Had it been right-handed, clockwise circularly polarized light approaching the circular polarizer from the left, its horizontal component would have also been retarded, however the resulting linearly polarized light would have been polarized along the absorbing axis of the linear polarizer and it would not have passed. To create a circular polarizer that instead passes right-handed polarized light and absorbs left-handed light, one again rotates the wave plate and linear polarizer 90° relative to each another. It is easy to appreciate that by reversing the positions of the transmitting and absorbing axes of the linear polarizer relative to the quarter-wave plate, one changes which handedness of polarized light gets transmitted and which gets absorbed. = Homogeneous circular polarizer = Homogeneous circular polarizer passing left-handed, counter-clockwise circularly polarized light. (Left-handed as viewed from the receiver.) A homogeneous circular polarizer passes one handedness of circular polarization unaltered and blocks the other handedness. This is similar to the way that a linear polarizer would fully pass one angle of linearly polarized light unaltered, but would fully block any linearly polarized light that was orthogonal to it. A homogeneous circular polarizer can be created by sandwiching a linear polarizer between two quarter-wave plates.Bass M (1995) Handbook of Optics, Second edition, Vol. 2, Ch. 22.19, McGraw-Hill, Specifically we take the circular polarizer described previously, which transforms circularly polarized light into linear polarized light, and add to it a second quarter-wave plate rotated 90° relative to the first one. Generally speaking, and not making direct reference to the above illustration, when either of the two polarizations of circularly polarized light enters the first quarter-wave plate, one of a pair of orthogonal components is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength relative to the other. This creates one of two linear polarizations depending on the handedness the circularly polarized light. The linear polarizer sandwiched between the quarter wave plates is oriented so that it will pass one linear polarization and block the other. The second quarter-wave plate then takes the linearly polarized light that passes and retards the orthogonal component that was not retarded by the previous quarter-wave plate. This brings the two components back into their initial phase relationship, reestablishing the selected circular polarization. Note that it does not matter in which direction one passes the circularly polarized light. =Circular and linear polarizing filters for photography= Linear polarizing filters were the first types to be used in photography and can still be used for non-reflex and older single-lens reflex cameras (SLRs). However, cameras with through-the-lens metering (TTL) and autofocusing systems – that is, all modern SLR and DSLR – rely on optical elements that pass linearly polarized light. If light entering the camera is already linearly polarized, it can upset the exposure or autofocus systems. Circular polarizing filters cut out linearly polarized light and so can be used to darken skies, improve saturation and remove reflections, but the circular polarized light it passes does not impair through-the-lens systems.Ang, Tom (2008).Fundamentals of Modern Photography.

He was a son of Egica and therefore a brother or half-brother of Wittiza.Thompson, The Goths in Spain, 250. After the defeat of king Roderic at the Battle of Guadalete, according to the Chronicle of 754, the Arabs under Tariq ibn Ziyad marched as far as Toledo, but Oppa, who was staying there, fled the city before they took it. Tariq executed many nobles still in the city on the pretense that they had assisted in Oppa's flight.Collins, Visigothic Spain, 133. Since the battle of Guadalete took place, according to the same chronicle, in 712 and the conquest of Toledo in 711 but after Roderic's defeat, either the battle of Guadalete must be pushed back or the conquest of Toledo pushed forward; the latter is preferred by Roger Collins.Collins, Visigothic Spain, 134. Though Oppa fled Toledo, he may have been caught and executed soon after; but there is no indication that he did not survive.Collins, Arab Conquest, 29-30. It is possible that the Oppa who fled Toledo and was a son of a previous king was the cause of the \\"internal fury\\" which wracked Spain at the time, as recorded in the Chronicle. Perhaps Oppa had been elected, declared, or even consecrated king at Toledo by rivals of both Roderic and his opponent Achila II, either before Roderic's final defeat or between his death and the Arab capture of Toledo.Collins, Visigothic Spain, 139. Collins, Arab Conquest, 30. If so, the death of the nobles who had \\"ambition for the kingdom\\" mentioned by the chronicler may have been Oppa's supporters who were killed in Toledo by the Arabs shortly after the battle in the south. Some historians, without any basis in the sources, have identified Oppa with Achila.Collins, Visigothic Spain, 138. Collins, Arab Conquest, 33. Oppa has grown in legend. According to the Chronicle of Alfonso III written in the late ninth century, he was a son of Wittiza, though based on Wittiza's approximate birth date, this is impossible. The Rotense version of the Alfonso III makes him an Archbishop of Toledo and the Ad Sebastianum version a Bishop of Seville.Collins, Visigothic Spain, 137. Oppa is said to have accompanied the Arab armies which invaded the Asturias in 718 in an attempt to put down Pelagius of Asturias. He reportedly engaged the rebel Goth in a long debate, but the Arabs were subsequently crushed in the Battle of Covadonga. This is undoubtedly a baseless legend.Collins, Arab Conquest, 147. The only part of the general story presented by the Alfonso III that is otherwise backed up is the claim that he was bishop of Seville, since a late tenth-century manuscript mentions a bishop of that city named Oppa in the correct time period, but the chronicle may have been the list compiler's source.Collins (Arab Conquest, 148-149) notes that he was the third bishop to sign the canons of the Seventeenth Council of Toledo in 693. The Chronicle of Albelda confirms that a bishop Oppa was captured at Covadonga.Collins, Arab Conquest, 145. According to later legend he was a commander of troops. Pelagius either had him executed or, out of respect for his priestly character, merely imprisoned. According to late sources, Oppas's older brother or half-brother was Sisebut, who later became the count of the Christians of Coimbra, as were his son Ataulf (fl. 770), his grandson Athanaric (fl. 801-802), and his great-grandson Teudo (fl. 805), who had descendants also. Literature In Alexandre Herculano's Eurico, o Presbítero, Oppas is portrayed as a traitor to his own country, whose troops treacherously went to the conqueror's side, and a close collaborator of the conquerors Musa and Tarik. He ends up killed in a fight against the main character, Eurico.

Area code 812 was one of the original NANP area codes introduced in 1947. Despite the presence of Evansville, Terre Haute and Bloomington, southern Indiana is not as densely populated as the rest of the state.

However, in August, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission delayed the implementation of mandatory ten-digit dialing until February 7, 2015, and the assignments of the first 930 numbers until March 7 to provide law enforcement and emergency medical services more time to update their telecommunication equipment. Until the implementation of 930, 812 had been one of the few original area codes (not counting whole-state area codes) to have never been split or overlaid.

It is a pale greenish blue or bluish green solid. Some forms of copper(II) hydroxide are sold as \\"stabilized\\" copper(II) hydroxide, although they likely consist of a mixture of copper(II) carbonate and hydroxide. Cupric hydroxide is a weak base. Occurrence Copper(II) hydroxide has been known since copper smelting began around 5000 BC although the alchemists were probably the first to manufacture it by mixing solutions of lye (sodium or potassium hydroxide) and blue vitriol (copper(II) sulfate).Richard Cowen, Essays on Geology, History, and People, Chapter 3: \\"Fire and Metals: Copper\\". Sources of both compounds were available in antiquity. It was produced on an industrial scale during the 17th and 18th centuries for use in pigments such as blue verditer and Bremen green.Tony Johansen, Historic Artist's Pigments . PaintMaking.com. 2006. These pigments were used in ceramics and painting.Blue verditer . Natural Pigments. 2007. =Laboratory synthesis= Copper(II) hydroxide can be produced by adding a sodium hydroxide to a dilute solution of copper(II) sulfate (CuSO4·5H2O).O. Glemser and H. Sauer \\"Copper(II) Hydroxide\\" in Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry, 2nd Ed. Edited by G. Brauer, Academic Press, 1963, NY. Vol. 1. p. 1013. The precipitate produced in this manner, however, often contains water and an appreciable amount of sodium hydroxide impurity. A purer product can be attained if ammonium chloride is added to the solution beforehand. Alternatively, copper hydroxide is readily made by electrolysis of water (containing a little electrolyte such as sodium sulfate, or magnesium sulfate) with a copper anode. =Mineral= The mineral of the formula Cu(OH)2 is called spertiniite. Copper(II) hydroxide is rarely found as an uncombined mineral because it slowly reacts with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to form a basic copper(II) carbonate. Thus copper slowly acquires a dull green coating in moist air by the reaction: :2 Cu(OH)2 \\\\+ CO2 -> Cu2CO3(OH)2 \\\\+ H2O The green material is in principle a 1:1 mole mixture of Cu(OH)2 and CuCO3.Masterson, W. L., & Hurley, C. N. (2004). Chemistry: Principles and Reactions, 5th Ed. Thomson Learning, Inc. (p 331)\\" This patina forms on bronze and other copper alloy statues such as the Statue of Liberty. Structure The structure of Cu(OH)2 has been determined by X-ray crystallography The copper center is square pyramidal. Four Cu-O distances in the plane range are 1.96 Å, and the axial Cu-O distance is 2.36 Å. The hydroxide ligands in the plane are either doubly bridging or triply bridging. Reactions It is stable to about 100 °C. Copper(II) hydroxide reacts with a solution of ammonia to form a deep blue solution of tetramminecopper [Cu(NH3)4]2+ complex ion. It catalyzes the oxidation of ammonia solutions in presence of dioxygen, giving rise to copper ammine nitrites, such as Cu(NO2)2(NH3)n. Copper(II) hydroxide is mildly amphoteric. It dissolves slightly in concentrated alkali, forming [Cu(OH)4]2−.Pauling, Linus (1970). General Chemistry. Dover Publications, Inc. (p 702). =Reagent for organic chemistry= Copper(II) hydroxide has a rather specialized role in organic synthesis. Often, when it is utilized for this purpose, it is prepared in situ by mixing a soluble copper(II) salt and potassium hydroxide. It is sometimes used in the synthesis of aryl amines. For example, copper(II) hydroxide catalyzes the reaction of ethylenediamine with 1-bromoanthraquinone or 1-amino-4-bromoanthraquinone to form 1-((2-aminoethyl)amino)anthraquinone or 1-amino-4-((2-aminoethyl)amino)anthraquinone, respectively: :center Copper(II) hydroxide also converts acid hydrazides to carboxylic acids at room temperature. This conversion is useful in the synthesis of carboxylic acids in the presence of other fragile functional groups. The yields are generally excellent as is the case with the production of benzoic acid and octanoic acid: :center Uses Copper(II) hydroxide in ammonia solution, known as Schweizer's reagent, possesses the interesting ability to dissolve cellulose. This property led to it being used in the production of rayon, a cellulose fiber. It is also used widely in the aquarium industry for its ability to destroy external parasites in fish, including flukes, marine ich, brook and marine velvet, without killing the fish. Although other water-soluble copper compounds can be effective in this role, they generally result in high fish mortality. Copper(II) hydroxide has been used as an alternative to the Bordeaux mixture, a fungicide and nematicide.Bordeaux Mixture. UC IPM online. 2007. Such products include Kocide 3000, produced by Kocide L.L.C. Copper(II) hydroxide is also occasionally used as ceramic colorant. Copper(II) hydroxide has been combined with latex paint, making a product designed to control root growth in potted plants. Secondary and lateral roots thrive and expand, resulting in a dense and healthy root system. It was sold under the name Spin Out, which was first introduced by Griffin L.L.C. The rights are now owned by SePRO Corp.\\"SePRO Corporation\\". It is now sold as Microkote either in a solution you apply yourself, or as treated pots. Other copper(II) hydroxides Chemical structure of azurite, one of many copper(II) hydroxides (color code: red = O, green = Cu, gray = C, white = H). Together with other components, copper(II) hydroxides are numerous. Several copper(II)-containing minerals contain hydroxide. Notable examples include azurite, malachite, antlerite, and brochantite. Azurite (2CuCO3·Cu(OH)2) and malachite (CuCO3·Cu(OH)2) are hydroxy-carbonates, whereas antlerite (CuSO4·2Cu(OH)2) and brochantite (CuSO4·3Cu(OH)2) are hydroxy-sulfates. Many synthetic copper(II) hydroxide derivatives have been investigated.

Early life Francis Loftus SullivanGRO Register of Births: MAR 1903 1d 727 WANDSWORTH - Francis Loftus Sullivan attended Stonyhurst, the Jesuit public school in Lancashire, England, whose alumni include Charles Laughton and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Career A heavily built man with a striking double-chin and a deep voice, Sullivan made his acting debut at the Old Vic at age 18 in Shakespeare's Richard III. He had considerable theatrical experience before he appeared in his first film in 1932, The Missing Rembrandt, as a German villain opposite Arthur Wontner as Sherlock Holmes. In 1935 he married the stage designer Frances Joan Perkins (born 1901) in Westminster in London.Francis L Sullivan in the England & Wales, Civil Registration Marriage Index, 1916-2005 - Ancestry.com In 1939 they were living at 'Hatch Hill' on Kingsley Green at Fernhurst in West Sussex.1939 England and Wales Register for Francis L Sullivan: Sussex, Horsham RD - Ancestry.com They were to remain married until his death. Among his film roles are Mr Bumble in Oliver Twist (1948) and Phil Nosseross in the film noir Night and the City (1950). Sullivan also played the part of Jaggers in two versions of Charles Dickens's Great Expectations - in 1934 and 1946. He appeared in a fourth Dickens film, the 1935 Universal Pictures version of The Mystery of Edwin Drood, in which he played Crisparkle. He was featured in The Citadel (1938), starring Robert Donat, and a decade later he played the role of Pierre Cauchon in the technicolor version of Joan of Arc (1948), starring Ingrid Bergman. In 1938 he starred in a revival of the Stokes brothers' play Oscar Wilde at London's Arts Theatre. He played the Attorney-General prosecuting the case defended by Robert Donat as barrister Sir Robert Morton, in the first film version of The Winslow Boy (1948). Sullivan also acted in light comedies, including My Favorite Spy (1951), starring Bob Hope and Hedy Lamarr, in which he played an enemy agent, and the comedy Fiddlers Three (1944), portraying Nero. He also played the role of Pothinus in the film version of George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra (1945). The film was directed by Gabriel Pascal, and was the last film personally supervised by Shaw himself. Sullivan reprised the role in a stage revival of the play. Sullivan, who eventually became a naturalised US citizen, won a Tony Award in 1955 for the Agatha Christie play Witness for the Prosecution. Earlier, he had played Hercule Poirot at London's Embassy Theatre in the Christie play Black Coffee (1930). Death He died of a heart attack on 19 November 1956, aged 53 (some sources claim he died from an unspecified \\"lung ailment\\").

She has been a Senator for New South Wales since 1997, representing the Liberal Party. Payne was born in Sydney and attended the University of New South Wales. She was the first woman to serve as federal president of the Young Liberals (1989–1991). Payne was appointed to the Senate in 1997, in place of Bob Woods. She was elected to a full term in 2001, and has since been re-elected four more times. Payne was first added to the shadow ministry in 2007, and when the Coalition returned to power in 2013 she was made Minister for Human Services in the Abbott Government. Payne was appointed Minister for Defence when Malcolm Turnbull became prime minister, becoming the first woman to hold the position. After Turnbull was replaced by Scott Morrison in August 2018, it was announced that she would replace Julie Bishop as Minister for Foreign Affairs in the new government. Early life Payne was born in Sydney, the daughter of Ann Noreen (née Johns) and William Elliott Payne. Her father was a World War II veteran who worked as an accountant and farmer. Payne grew up in Bardwell Park, in Sydney's southern suburbs. She attended MLC School before going on to the University of New South Wales, where she graduated with Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degrees. In her second year at university, she was involved in a road accident near Michelago. She was a passenger in a car which rolled over and she received serious injuries to her neck, fracturing her odontoid process. Payne joined the Liberal Party in 1982, and was state president of the New South Wales Young Liberals from 1987 to 1988. She then served as federal president of the Young Liberals from 1989 to 1991, the first woman to hold the position, and as a member of the state executive of the New South Wales Liberals from 1991 to 1997. In 1991, Payne was an unsuccessful candidate to fill the casual vacancy caused by the resignation of Senator Peter Baume. At the time she was serving as private secretary to Senator Robert Hill. In 1994, Payne was appointed vice-chair of the Australian Republican Movement, serving under chairman Malcolm Turnbull. At the time, she was working as an adviser to Premier John Fahey and serving on the Liberal Party's state executive. Tony Abbott, who was then the national executive director of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, criticised her for accepting the position, stating \\"anyone who does not support constitutional monarchy is at odds with the party\\". John Howard accused her of a \\"conflict of interest\\", stating she had joined \\"an organisation dominated by Labor sympathisers\\". Senator (1997–present) Payne early in her career Following the resignation of Senator Bob Woods in March 1997, Payne was chosen by the Liberal Party to fill the casual vacancy. She took office on 9 April 1997, and has subsequently been re-elected to the Senate at the 2001, 2007, 2013, and 2016 elections. Her office is located in Parramatta, in Sydney's western suburbs. Payne was a backbencher for her first decade in the Senate, from 1997 to 2007. When she took her seat, The Sydney Morning Herald ran a headline describing her as \\"The Senator John Howard Didn't Want\\". She was preselected in third place on the Coalition ticket at the 2001 election, with Howard intervening to ensure Helen Coonan ranked ahead of her as the first Liberal candidate. Prior to the 2007 election, members of the Liberal Party's conservative faction attempted to have Payne removed from the ticket. However, for the sake of unity Howard and Bill Heffernan intervened to ensure that she retained a winning place on the Coalition ticket. Payne served on various Senate committees during that time, notably as chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee. Payne was appointed as a shadow parliamentary secretary after the Coalition lost the 2007 election, with responsibility for foreign affairs (2007–2008) and international development assistance and indigenous affairs (2008–2009). When Tony Abbott became Leader of the Opposition in December 2009, she was appointed Shadow Minister for COAG and Modernising the Federation. After the 2010 election, she was instead made Shadow Minister for Housing and Shadow Minister for Indigenous Development and Employment. =Abbott Government (2013–2015)= When the Coalition won the 2013 federal election, Payne was appointed Minister for Human Services in the Abbott Government. In March 2014, she announced that Medicare offices would close on Saturdays, as there had been a \\"60 per cent reduction in walk-ins into Medicare shopfronts on Saturdays\\". In June 2014, she announced the creation of \\"myGov hybrid government shopfronts\\", which are designed to assist customers with setting up online accounts for government services such as Centrelink, Medicare, the Australian Taxation Office, and the National Disability Insurance Scheme. =Turnbull Government (2015–2018)= Payne with U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter in October 2015. Payne with James Mattis, Malcolm Turnbull, Rex Tillerson, and Julie Bishop in June 2017. After Malcolm Turnbull defeated Tony Abbott in a leadership spill, Payne was elevated to the cabinet and appointed Minister for Defence in the Turnbull Government from 21 September 2015. She was the first woman to hold the position, which has existed since Federation in 1901. Neil James, the executive director of the Australia Defence Association, welcomed her appointment, stating: \\"Too many defence ministers have been shoved sideways into this portfolio in the twilight of the parliamentary careers because it's seen as a badge of seniority, and defence suffers. Marise Payne is a politician with a large part of her parliamentary career still ahead of her, and with this appointment, unlike the last few, there’s more to be optimistic about than to be pessimistic about.\\" Payne oversaw the final months of the long-anticipated 2016 Defence White Paper, which she launched in February 2016 with Turnbull and Chief of the Defence Force Mark Binskin. She also launched the government's Integrated Investment Program and the Defence Industry Policy Statement. A spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry criticised the white paper for its \\"negative\\" remarks about the South China Sea. Payne responded that \\"we have a strong defence relationship [with China] but we do have a point of difference in this regard and we are certainly not going to take a backward step in articulating our position\\". In April 2016, she and Turnbull announced that French firm DCNS, now called Naval Group, had been awarded a $50 billion contract to build a new fleet of submarines for the Royal Australian Navy. The submarine project will be undertaken in Adelaide rather than in France, generating 2,800 jobs. Payne had abdominal surgery in late 2016, which resulted in the deferral of the \\"two-plus-two\\" meeting between the foreign and defence ministers of Australia and Japan. In January 2018, the Australian Financial Review reported that Turnbull had considered replacing Payne with Christopher Pyne in the December 2017 cabinet reshuffle. She would then have been appointed to succeed Mark Higgie as the Australian Ambassador to NATO and the European Union. Her department reportedly began preparing briefing papers for the new minister, but in the end the move was not carried out. =Morrison Government (2018–present)= Payne at the Trilateral Strategic Dialogue between Australia, Japan and the U.S. in August 2019 Malcolm Turnbull was replaced by Scott Morrison as Liberal leader and prime minister on 24 August 2018. Foreign minister Julie Bishop, an unsuccessful candidate for the Liberal leadership, announced her resignation from cabinet on 26 August. Morrison subsequently announced that Payne would succeed Bishop as Minister for Foreign Affairs in the new government. She was sworn in on 28 August, becoming Australia's second female foreign minister. After the government's re-election at the 2019 election, Payne was also appointed Minister for Women. On 19 April 2020, Payne called for a global inquiry into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic including China's handling of the initial outbreak in Wuhan. She called for the inquiry to be conducted independently of the World Health Organization. Payne's call was supported by the opposition Labor Party's Health spokesperson Chris Bowen, who urged the Morrison Government to win international support for the inquiry. Political positions Payne is viewed as a member of the Liberal Party's moderate or \\"small-l liberal\\" wing. In a 2008 interview, she stated: \\"I am a liberal, I am a member of the Liberal Party. I have always called myself a liberal. If I had wanted to be a conservative I would have gone to London and joined the Conservative Party.\\" Payne is a republican, and served as vice-chair of the Australian Republican Movement in the 1990s. According to Senator Simon Birmingham, she argued forcefully against the Northern Territory National Emergency Response in the Liberal partyroom. In 2002, she said she had \\"very real concerns\\" about how mandatory detention of illegal immigrants affected women and children, proposing that they instead be released into the community. In 2004, in response to calls for the federal government to withdraw Medicare funding of abortions, she stated \\"people should not be prepared to see the rights and health of Australian women go backwards\\". Personal life Payne is in a long-term relationship with Stuart Ayres, who is a minister in the New South Wales state government. The couple met while campaigning together at the 2007 federal election. As of 2010, they were building a home together in Mulgoa.

One of the first women to gain access into the Congressional press galleries, she used her questions to advocate for social reform and women's rights. Her best known books for children are entitled, History of My Pets (1850); Recollections of My Childhood (1851); Stories of Many Lands (1866); Merrie England (1854); Bonnie Scotland (1861); Stories and Legends of Travel and History; Stories and Sights of France and Italy (1867). The volumes for older readers are two series of collected prose writings, Greenwood Leaves (1849, 1851); Poems (1850); Haps and Mishaps of a Tour in Europe (1852); A Forest Tragedy (1856); A Record of Five Years (1867); New Life in New Lands (1873); Victoria, Queen of England. This last was published, in 1883, by Anderson & Allen of New York, and Sampson, Low & Marston, London. Lippincott was connected as editor and contributor with various American magazines, as well as weekly and daily papers. Lippincott also wrote much for London journals, especially for All the Year Round. For several years, she lived almost wholly in Europe, for the benefit of her greatly impaired health and for the education of her daughter. When she returned to the United States, she lived in Washington D.C. and then New York. She was a prominent member of the literary society of New York along with Anne Lynch Botta, Edgar Allan Poe, Margaret Fuller, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Horace Greeley, Richard Henry Stoddard, Andrew Carnegie, Mary Mapes Dodge, Julia Ward Howe, Charles Butler, Fitz-Greene Halleck, Delia Bacon, and Bayard Taylor, among others. Early years and education Sara Jane Clarke was born on September 23, 1823, at Pompey, New York to parents Deborah Baker Clarke (c. 1791–1874) and Dr. Thaddeus C. Clarke (1770–1854), a grandson of Princeton President Jonathan Edwards. [Actually Thaddeus was a grandson of Rev. Jonathan Edwards' sister Elizabeth, and the second cousin of Aaron Burr.] Lippincott's house in New Brighton Fearless, at ten years of age, she rode a bare-backed horse, standing on his back. At the age of twelve, she went to school in Rochester, New York living with her older brother. There was nothing remarkable about her education, but she did study Italian, algebra, calculus, English and French history, though literature was her delight, and it became evident that writing was her vocation. At the age of sixteen, she was providing \\"fresh, piquant, racy\\" pieces to the Rochester papers. She removed with her family in 1842 to New Brighton, Pennsylvania, where her father practiced as a physician, and which she considered to be her home time for the rest of her life. There, she attended the Greenwood Institute, a ladies' academy, from which she may have taken her pseudonym. She left school at the age of nineteen. CareerPoet, writer, correspondent= Not long after she returned home, in 1845 and 1846, she started writing using the pen name, Grace Greenwood. The earliest writing of Lippincott was in the form of poetry and children's stories, which she published in local papers. In 1844, she drew national attention, at age 21, with a poem published in the New York Mirror, then under the editorship of George Pope Morris and Nathaniel Parker Willis. Soon after, she was writing for the Home Journal and other literary magazines of the day, under both her given name and her pseudonym. In the February 14, 1846 issue of the Home Journal, The Wife's Appeal, a poem by Sara J. Clarke, is published just above Tit-for-Tat, a story by Grace Greenwood. By October 1849, Godey's Lady's Book listed her as an assistant editor and she was also editor of Godey's Dollar Newspaper. For six or eight years, her summer home was New Brighton. In winter, she was in Philadelphia, Washington D.C., New York City, writing for Whittier, or for Willis and Morris, or for Neal's Gazette, or for Godey. Lippincott was the first \\"lady correspondent\\" in Washington, D.C., beginning her work in that line with letters to a Philadelphia paper in 1850. That year, many of her early sketches and letters were collected and republished by Ticknor & Fields under the name of Greenwood Leaves. She would go on to become a correspondent for the Saturday Evening Post. She was a highly respected journalist and consistently argued for the reform of women's roles and rights.Garrett, Paula K. \\"A Splinter Off the\\" Sound Old Theological Block\\": Grace Greenwood's Humorous Revision of the American Jeremiad.\\" Studies in American Humor (2005): 17-43. She joined the National Era, a weekly abolitionist newspaper, and copyedited the serialized original version of Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin as well as writing columns, travel letters, and articles. Her staunch abolitionist views contributed to the ongoing national controversy. Lippincott's poetry received significant critical attention. A published collection, Poems (1851), included passionate poetry and references to her intimate friendship to Anna Phillips, indicating an acceptance of intimate same sex friendships. Also that year, she published History of My Pets. Sophia Hawthorne wrote that her husband, the author Nathaniel Hawthorne, considered it \\"the best children's book he has ever seen\\".Valenti, Patricia Dunlavy. Sophia Peabody Hawthorne: A Life, Volume 2: 1848–1871. Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 2015: 55. In 1853, she made her first visit to Europe, on an assignment for The New York Times, having the distinction of being the first woman reporter on the Times payroll. She spent a little over a year abroad, which, in the dedication to her daughter of one of her juvenile books, she calls \\"the golden year of her life\\". Her accounts of her travels were well-received contributions to literature of the day. The correspondence was collected immediately after her return, and published under the title of Haps and Mishaps of a Tour in Europe. Upon her return, she also made frequent excursions into California, writing vivid descriptions of the land. In the fall of 1855, she published Merrie England, the first of a series of books of foreign travel for children. Nathaniel Hawthorne criticized her travel letters, calling her an \\"ink-stained woman\\" and claiming he could do as well. Despite this, Lippincott seems to have gotten along amiably with Hawthorne's family. She dedicated her children's book Recollections of My Childhood, and Other Stories to his children Julian and Una Hawthorne. =Publisher= The Little Pilgrim masthead, 1855 On October 17, 1853, she married Leander K. Lippincott, of Philadelphia, who was a correspondent for several New York papers. That year, Lippincott and her husband started The Little Pilgrim, a monthly American children's magazine devoted to the amusement, instruction, and well-being of children. She was soon producing magazine articles and essays, her contributions conveying historical and biographical information. In this paper, Louisa May Alcott made her debut as a writer of children's stories. Collected from time to time, and published by Ticknor & Fields, they made a juvenile library numbering nearly a dozen volumes, remarkable for the felicitous manner in which they conveyed historical information. On October 3, 1855, they had a daughter, Annie Grace. In the spring of 1856, a volume, entitled A Forest Tragedy, and other Tales, appeared; and in the fall of 1857, Stories and Legends of History and Travel, was the second of her travel series. =Activist= Distinguishing herself as a lecturer on literary topics, Lippincott also lectured extensively before and during the Civil War on her abolitionist stance and to other social issues, such as prison and asylum reform, as well as the abolition of capital punishment. During the war, Lippincott was a lecturer to soldiers and at sanitary fairs. President Abraham Lincoln referred to her as \\"Grace Greenwood the Patriot\\". However, women's rights became the focus of her speeches, particularly after the war. Her writings from this period were republished in Records of Five Years (1867). By the 1870s, Lippincott wrote primarily for the New York Times. Her articles focused mainly on women's issues, such as advocating for Fanny Kemble's right to wear trousers, Susan B. Anthony's right to vote and all women's right to receive equal pay for equal work. =London and Capitol Hill= Lippincott's summer cottage, Manitou, Colorado, 1876 Sara Lippincott (1895) The marriage was not a happy union. After her husband fled the United States in 1876 to escape prosecution for misappropriation of government funds, Lippincott continued her writing and resumed lecturing in order to support herself and her daughter, who trained for a career on the stage. By 1879, Lippincott was residing in London, having moved to Europe with her daughter. For the ten years preceding this, she had done most work and won most distinction in journalism, principally in articles contributed from Washington, to the New York Tribune and the New York Times, on national and political questions, which she has handled in a patriotic way, showing an unusual knowledge of political history and of the construction, principles and tactics of the two opposing parties of the United States and time. She had also contributed to the New York Times, and a leading California journal, several series of letters from Europe—principally from London. She worked for the London Journal, and also wrote a biography, Queen Victoria: Her Girlhood and Womanhood (1883). In 1887, she returned to the United States and continued to work. In 1895, she was living on Capitol Hill with her daughter, and was engaged upon the piece, \\"Recollections of Washington\\". But as much as she loved the capitol city, her health was better when she was abroad. Death and legacy Lippincott later lived with her daughter in New Rochelle, New York, where she died of bronchitis on April 20, 1904. Lippincott is buried in the Civil War section of Grove Cemetery in New Brighton.(requires interlibrary account access) Her obituary was on the front page of the New York Times, \\"proving her importance as a literary figure in the nineteenth century\\". Style and phases Lippincott's style was something quite new, characterized as \\"brilliant, picturesque, piquante, every line sparkled; the words seemed to bound rather than flow from her pen\\". Her writings displayed a charm of style which was evident in the best American works of the mid 19th-century but was so seldom seen thirty years later. The language was redundant, but not over- laden; picturesque, without any effort to be so. A letter-writer, she charmed a million readers by the piquant dash and spicy flavor of her style. There appear in the writings of Lippincott three phases of development, three epochs of a literary career. The first lasted from the days of the boarding-school till marriage, —from the first merry chit-chat and Greenwood Leaves, to the full-rounded, mellow prime, as displayed in the letters from Europe. Then follows a decade, during which story-writing for children principally occupied her pen. With the Civil War commenced the third period, years \\"vexed with the drums and tramplings,\\" the struggles of middle life.

Background At the end of February 1865 the port city of Wilmington had fallen to Union troops under the command of Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield. Schofield was then to move his forces inland from the coast and join with Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's forces at Goldsboro, North Carolina, where three Union armies would move against a Confederate army being gathered under Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston. Schofield, with the units from Alfred Terry's Expeditionary Corps, moved north from Wilmington, while Maj. Gen. Jacob D. Cox took his XXIII Corps division and sailed up the coast and landed at New Bern, North Carolina. At New Bern, the Union forces were increased to three divisions and formed into a Provisional Corps with Cox in command. Moving towards Goldsboro, the Union forces repaired the railroad which was to function as a supply route for Sherman's Army Group. Johnston's army was too far away to move against Schofield's divided forces, but General Braxton Bragg's forces, falling back from Wilmington, were within striking distance. Bragg moved against Cox near Kinston. Battle Map of Wyse Fork Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. On March 7, Federal advance units encountered Bragg's entrenched forces along Southwest Creek east of Kinston. Bragg's position not only blocked Cox's path but threatened a vital cross road and the New Bern- Goldsboro Railroad. Cox saw the importance of this position and moved forward the divisions of Brig. Gen. Innis N. Palmer to protect the railroad and Maj. Gen. Samuel P. Carter to protect the roads. Bragg's forces were also reinforced by veterans from the Army of Tennessee and the North Carolina Junior Reserves, all under the command of General D.H. Hill. Reinforced, Bragg went on the offensive and sent a division under North Carolina native Robert Hoke into the Union left flank. Hoke's attack hit a New England brigade in Carter's division, capturing an entire regiment (the 15th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry). Hill joined the advance with the Junior Reserves but they panicked and refused to go any further. Hill left them behind and moved on with his veterans, hitting the Union brigade and defeating it. Disaster threatened the Union flank when Bragg stopped Hill's advance and sent him far to the north to counterattack a Union threat. When Hill arrived he found no Federals in sight. At this time Cox, who had been away from the front lines, returned and moved up his reserve division under Maj. Gen. Thomas H. Ruger to plug the gap between Palmer and Carter. Skirmishing continued for the next few days until Hoke tried again to turn the Federal left flank on March 10. The Federal position had been strongly fortified by artillery and repulsed Hoke's attack within an hour. Hill then moved against the Union center but again Federal artillery proved decisive and the attackers were repulsed. The remaining elements from the Federal XXIII Corps, which had just arrived in New Bern from Tennessee, were moving on Kinston. Facing five Union divisions, Bragg withdrew. Aftermath Bragg had only momentarily been able to check Cox's advance. Schofield's forces reached two full corps and were organized into the Army of the Ohio. Sherman's armies, which had just defeated Johnston's army at Bentonville, joined with Schofield at Goldsboro on March 23. Facing three Union armies, Johnston retreated to the north and on April 26 Johnston surrendered to Sherman.

Directed by Freddie Francis, it stars Janette Scott, Oliver Reed, Sheila Burrell, and Alexander Davion. The screenplay was written by Jimmy Sangster, based loosely on the 1949 crime novel Brat Farrar by Josephine Tey. Synopsis After the wealthy Mr. and Mrs. Ashby die in a plane crash, their three children were left in the care of their Aunt Harriet (Burrell). Three years later, the elder son, Tony, jumped into the sea when he was 15 after leaving a suicide note: his body was never recovered. Eight years later, the other son, Simon, (Reed) is a cruel, spendthrift alcoholic, trying to have his sister, Eleanor (Scott) committed for insanity so that he can be the sole heir. Only three weeks before he inherits, a man (Davion) resembling an adult Tony appears. Initially he is only seen by Eleanor, who believes that her dead brother is calling her from beyond the grave and attempts suicide, but is rescued by him. The man then claims that he is Tony and had simply run away. Eleanor believes him but Harriet calls him an impostor. In fact, he is a con man hired by Keith Kossett (Bonney), son of the family attorney (Denham), as a way for Bonney to further embezzle from the estate. Tony hears music from the family chapel at night; when he investigates, he is attacked by a masked figure with a hook. Eleanor had heard the music in the past but had been too afraid to leave her room. Simon appears to be open-minded about Tony but does not really believe him and, fearing losing the inheritance, sabotages the car when Tony and Eleanor go for a drive: Eleanor is nearly killed. That night, the music starts again. She and Tony investigate and see Simon playing the organ with a masked singer; although it emerges that the signing is a recording. Eleanor is spotted by the masked person who emerges with the hook, but is stopped by \\"Tony.\\" The masked person is revealed to be Aunt Harriet who explains that Simon has been driven insane by guilt over his brother's death and this ritual calms Simon by allowing him to pretend that his brother Tony is still alive. He would play a recording of Tony singing, Simon would play the organ, with Harriet as a masked \\"singer\\" playing Tony's part. Eleanor falls in love Tony and, conflicted by seemingly incestuous thoughts, is about to commit suicide, when he stops her and confesses that he is not her brother, Meanwhile, Simon has been having an affair with Eleanor's nurse who, when she guesses Simon's murder attempt, tries to leave. When he stops her, she threatens to expose him so he drowns her in the garden pond and tells Eleanor that she has left. The fake Tony investigates the chapel, and finds Tony's mummified body, despite Harriet's attempt to stop him, after the struggle reveals a hidden wall. He is about to leave, but is stopped by Simon, who admits he had tricked the real Tony into writing the suicide note and then murdered him and that he had sabotaged the car. Simon then slugs and binds him. When the man comes to, Simon is playing the organ, with the real Tony's body now seated on a chair. Simon informs the impostor that he and Tony have had a talk and have decided to have the man \\"join\\" Tony. Harriet appears, and persuades Simon to leave and that she will take care of the situation. Unfazed at seeing the corpse, it is evident that she also knew the truth. She sets the chapel on fire with a lantern to protect Simon, and leaves. Eleanor, alarmed by the fire appears, sees the real Tony's body and unties the fake Tony. They flee and, with the chapel ablaze and Tony's body inside, Simon's madness takes him over. He staggers to the chapel to try to \\"rescue\\" Tony, but is trapped by the flames and overcome as he clutches Tony's skeletal remains.

Tillet was a leading box office draw in the early 1940s and was twice World Heavyweight Champion by the American Wrestling Association run by Paul Bowser in Boston.  Early life  Tillet was born in 1903 in the Ural Mountains in Russia to French parents. His mother was a teacher and his father was a railroad engineer. Tillet's father died when he was young. As a child he had a completely normal appearance and Tillet was nicknamed \\"The Angel\\" due to his angelic face. In 1917, Tillet and his mother left Russia due to the Revolution and moved to France, where they settled in Reims. When Tillet was 20, he noticed swelling in his feet, hands, and head, and after visiting a doctor was diagnosed with acromegaly—a condition usually caused by a benign tumor on the pituitary gland, resulting in bone overgrowth and thickening. He had wanted to become a lawyer, but his acromegaly prevented him from doing so. Tillet served in the French Navy for five years as an engineer.  Professional wrestling career  The French Angel against Lou Thesz in the ring, 1940 Tillet being interviewed in Montreal, 1940. In February 1937, Tillet met Karl Pojello (Lithuanian Karolis Požėla) in Singapore. Pojello was a professional wrestler, and convinced Tillet to enter the business. Tillet and Pojello moved to Paris for training, and Tillet wrestled for two years in France and England until World War II forced them to leave for the United States in 1939. In Boston, Massachusetts, in 1940, promoter Paul Bowser pushed Tillet, who was wrestling as The French Angel, as a main eventer, and he became a large draw in the area. As a result of his popularity, Tillet was booked as unstoppable, and was unbeaten for a span of 19 consecutive months. Tillet was the AWA World Heavyweight Champion from May 1940 until May 1942. He re-appeared with the Boston-based title for a short time in 1944. As a result of his success, several Angel imitators emerged, including Paul Olaffsen (Swedish Angel), who also had acromegaly; Tony Angelo (Russian Angel), Tor Johnson (Super Swedish Angel), Jack Rush (Canadian Angel), Wladislaw Tulin (Polish Angel), Stan Pinto (Czech Angel), Clive Welsh (Irish Angel), Jack Falk (Golden Angel), Gil Guerrero (Black Angel), and Jean Noble (Lady Angel). Tillet competed against Tor Johnson, who was billed as The Swedish Angel on those occasions. Maurice Tillet in 1953 By 1945, Tillet's health began to fail and he was no longer advertised as unstoppable. In his final wrestling match, in Singapore on February 14, 1953, working The National Wrestling Alliance Mid South Area then known as Tri-State and owned by Leroy McGuirk he agreed to lose to Bert Assirati. In 1950, Chicago sculptor Louis Linck befriended Tillet and made a series of plaster busts commemorating him for his wrestling career. One of the busts is in Chicago’s International Museum of Surgical Science.  Death  Tillet died on September 4, 1954, in Chicago, from cardiovascular disease after hearing of his trainer's passing. Tillet is buried at the Lithuanian National Cemetery in Justice, Illinois, Cook County, south of Chicago.

She studied at the University of Uppsala, where her studies were interrupted when she contracted tuberculosis. She achieved her first great success with the novel Tjärdalen (The Tar Still). In this work and in her second novel Hjortronlandet, she explores themes of alienation and isolation. Her early novels are focused on the difficult conditions facing poor farmers in the northern Swedish province of Västerbotten during the nineteenth century.  Career  Sara Lidman is arguably one of the most important writers of the Swedish language in the twentieth century. This is especially so because of her innovative method of combining spoken vernaculars with Biblical language in a way closely tied to a certain kind of popular imaginary, while also integrating the worldly and the spiritual. In connection with her first four novels, she wrote extensively on political subjects, always from a strongly socialist standpoint. She engaged in protest against the Vietnam War (including traveling to North Vietnam and participating in the Russell Tribunal) and against apartheid in South Africa. She supported the widely influential miners' strikes of 1969–1970 and was active in the Communist and environmentalist movements. Between 1977 and 1985, she wrote a series of seven novels dealing with the colonization process of the north of Sweden. She was awarded a number of prizes, including the Nordic Council's Literature Prize for her work Vredens barn. Sara Lidman  Bibliography  *Tjärdalen, 1953. (The Tar Still) *Hjortronlandet, 1955.

Essouk is shown as Tadmekka. Goldfields are indicated by light brown shading. Essouk (Arabic: ) is a commune and small village in the Kidal Region of Mali. The village lies 45 km northwest of Kidal in the Adrar des Ifoghas massif. The ruins of the medieval town of Tadmakka (Arabic: ) lie 2 km northeast of the present village. Between the 9th and the 15th centuries Tadmekka served as an important entrepôt for the trans-Saharan trade. The commune is very large in area but sparsely populated. The 2009 census recorded only 2,383 people in an area of approximately 25,000 km2.This area is given in the Plan de Securite Alimentaire Commune Rural but appears to be too large. Kidal Cercle covers an area of 25,617 km2 but precise boundaries have not been established for the three communes within the cercle: Anefif, Essouk and the Urban commune of Kidal. See: . The village of Essouk has only a small permanent population. The rainfall is too low for rain-fed agriculture and almost all the population in the area are nomadic pastoralists.. History Tadmekka prospered between the 9th and 15th centuries as an entrepôt for caravans crossing the Sahara Desert. For caravans travelling south, the town served as the last stopping place before entering the Sudan. The town is mentioned by al-Bakri in his Book of Routes and Realms which he completed in 1068: > ...across the desert plain to Tādmakka, which of all the towns in the world > is the one that resembles Mecca the most. Its name means \\"Mecca-like\\". It is > a large town amidst the mountains and ravines and is better built than Ghāna > or Kawkaw [Gao]. The inhabitants of Tādmakka are Muslim Berbers who veil > themselves as Berbers of the desert do. They live on meat as well as on > grain which the earth produces without being tilled. Sorghum and other > grains are imported for them from the land of the Sūdān.. A translation into > French is available online: . The Arab geographer al-Zuhri writing in the middle of the 12th century, reported that the Almoravids helped Ghana in a war against Tadmekka in 1083-4 and as a result Tadmekka became Muslim. The historian Nehemia Levtzion pointed out that Tadmekka would have been a Muslim town well before this date and speculated that al-Zuhri may have been referring to the conversion of the population from the Ibadi form of Islam to the more orthodox Maliki school of Sunni Islam. Traders in Tadmekka would have had commercial links with North African towns such as Tahert and Ouargla where there were Ibadi communities. The medieval town was spread in a north-south direction between two chains of rocky hills that run parallel to each other on either side of a wadi. The main section of the town was on the east bank and extended for 1 km by 200 m. A central section covering an area of 200 m by 100 m was built on a small island while the third section extended for 500 m by 200 m on the west bank.. Page 488 has a plan of the ruins. Associated with the town are number of cemeteries. In a cemetery lying to the southwest of the town, tombstones have been discovered that have Arabic epigraphs with 11th century dates. Rock faces on either side of the valley contain petroglyphs as well as inscriptions written using either the kufic or tifinagh scripts. Some of the Arabic inscriptions include 11th century dates. Archaeological excavations were carried out between January and March in 2005 by a team led by Sam Nixon. Of the three areas of the town investigated, the most complete stratigraphic sequence was obtained at a location opposite the island on the eastern side of the wadi. A 5 m x 5 m area was excavated to a depth of 6.5 m before undisturbed soil was reached. A series of 12 radiometric dates were obtained from carbon containing material. The four samples from the deepest levels produced a range of dates centred on middle of the 8th century while samples from the top levels gave 12th and 14th century dates. It is sometimes referred to as the \\"cradle of Tuareg civilization\\". The annual Saharan Nights festival showcases traditional Tuareg music as well as featuring various world music performers. Oral tradition holds that Boctou, foundress of Timbuktu, was originally from Essouk. Essouk is also an important archaeological site, featuring rock carvings more than eight thousand years old.  World Heritage Status  The archaeological site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on September 8, 1999 in the Cultural category.*. NotesReferences *. *.

The initial transmitter power was 10 watts, with plans to expand the wattage as early as 1981. The first studio was located in the upper area of Longwood University's Jarman Auditorium, with weekly meetings taking place downstairs in the auditorium proper. Some time between September 1982 and February 1983, WUTA received and installed new equipment, and the in-house record collection was expanded. During these early years WUTA experienced a myriad of technical problems, ranging from a four-week transformer malfunction to interference with fellow Farmville radio station WFLO-FM as well as the WTVR television station out of Richmond. Programming Student programming and music is heard daily between 7 p.m. and 2 a.m., with a relay of Harrisonburg's NPR member station WMRA filling the remaining time. Awards and honors WMLU received the first place award for Outstanding Sports Coverage for a non- commercial/public radio station from the Virginia Association of Broadcasters in 2009. It repeated the accomplishment in 2010 accompanied by a runner up award for best promotion for a sponsored event.

It is the third major installment in the Call of Duty series. It was released for PlayStation 3, Wii, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It was a launch title for the PlayStation 3 and Wii in North America, Europe and Australia. Gameplay Call of Duty 3 is a historical first-person shooter game that has a single-player campaign mode and multiplayer mode. It is open-ended, giving the player multiple paths to complete objectives, but plays similarly to the series' previous installment. Players fight alongside AI-controlled teammates against enemies who use various attack patterns, hide behind cover, and regroup to improved defensive positions. A character can be positioned in one of three stances: standing, crouching, or prone, each affecting the player's rate of movement and accuracy. Two firearms can be carried, and both fragmentation and smoke grenades can also be equipped; unlike previous installments in the series, players have the ability to toss live grenades back at the enemy. Weapons and ammo from fallen foes or friendlies can be picked up to replace weapons in a player's inventory. A player may fire from the hip or aim down the gun's iron sights for increased accuracy. The compass on the heads-up display (HUD) helps the player navigate to the location of each objective. Using cover helps the player avoid enemy fire or recover health after taking significant damage. Similar to Call of Duty 2, the edges of the screen turn red and the character's heartbeat will increase in volume, indicating that the player's health is low; it can be replenished through an automatic recovery system when the character is not taking fire. =Campaign= The player takes the perspective of either an American, British, Canadian, or Polish soldier during the single-player campaign, for a total of 14 missions. Set in the Western Front of World War II, Call of Duty 3 takes place in the year 1944 and contains missions specific to four major Allied campaigns in the Battle of Normandy. The player takes part in a series of objectives marked by their HUD; these include having the character arrive at a checkpoint, eliminate enemies in a specified location, manning a tank, and marking targets for air strikes. Call of Duty 3 introduces to the series scripted close-combat sequences and multiple actions to arming explosives, both of which require the player to press buttons in sequences to progress. =Multiplayer= In addition to the single-player campaign, Call of Duty 3 features a wide range of multiplayer modes for players to participate in – each team allowing up to 24 on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, and 16 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in a single match. This is only in the online mode. All team game modes feature the soldiers of the Allied nations versus those of the Axis. Multiplayer features are absent from the Wii edition. It is the first game in the Call of Duty series to introduce two different game modes. The \\"Normalized\\" mode was added to allow console players a way to adjust to the smaller kill box of Call of Duty, its expansion United Offensive, and Call of Duty 2. On the Xbox 360, Call of Duty 3 divides its multiplayer aspect into Player and Ranked matches. Player matches allow players to invite other players into their games, but do not contribute points toward the leader board or unlock Achievements. Ranked matches put the player with and against teams of random players, and contribute towards player points and allow players to unlock Achievements. PlotAmerican Campaign= In the American campaign, the player controls Private Nichols, a replacement for the 29th Infantry Division. After arriving in a staging area outside Saint-Lô, he is assigned to his new squad consisting of veterans Corporal Mike Dixon, Private Leroy Huxley (voiced by Benjamin Diskin), and the squad's CO, Sergeant Frank McCullin. Shortly after Nichols' arrival, the squad participates in the final offensive in the capture of Saint-Lô. Upon arriving at the outskirts of the town, McCullin enlists radio operator Private First Class Salvatore Guzzo, who had become separated from his unit, to assist the squad in the attack, despite the latter's objections. During the brutal street to street fighting, the squad takes shelter from a German artillery barrage, during which Guzzo demands that the squad should fall back. As the shelling intensifies, Guzzo loses patience and tries to leave but is stopped by McCullin, who threatens to shoot him for desertion. After the squad fights off a final counterattack by the Germans, Saint-Lô is finally declared secure. Shortly after the battle, the squad is folded in with the 90th Infantry Division as reinforcements to help secure Saint-Germain-sur- Sèves. As the squad pushes forward and eventually succeeds in clearing the area, it becomes clear that McCullin, after witnessing years of war and death, is beginning to lose touch with reality, often appearing confused and distracted, even in the middle of battle. Sometime later the squad takes part in the assault on Mayenne in order to capture its heavily fortified bridge. After the squad fights through a German garrison, McCullin finally snaps and effectively shuts down, becoming almost completely unresponsive, leaving leadership of the squad to Dixon, which is eventually able to fight their way to the bridge. Huxley is tasked with disarming several German bombs rigged to the bridge, but is wounded before he can begin. McCullin, a former combat engineer, finally manages to shake his delirium and takes Huxley's place to disarm the bombs, as Nichols and the rest of the squad protects him. McCullin is mortally wounded by a German mortar round but manages to disarm the final bomb. Dixon is promoted to Sergeant and assumes command of the squad. Shortly after the squad is sent to clear out Forêt d'Écouves, in order to aid the 2nd Battalion's advance, and to locate a company of combat engineers that had gone missing after entering the forest several days prior. After fighting their way through several ambushes and hidden enemy emplacements, they eventually locate a surviving engineer, who explains how their convoy was ambushed and supply depots were overrun by the Germans. Nichols and the squad are able to recapture the supply depot and destroy a German roadblock, effectively clearing the remaining Germans out of the forest. The squad is then sent to aid in the liberation of a vital crossroads at Le Bourg St. Leonard, effectively trapping the remaining German forces between the US forces to the south and the British, Canadian, and Polish forces to the north, all but closing the Falaise Pocket, but are displeased when they are then ordered to defend the town of Chambois, the last escape route for the Germans trapped in the Pocket, in order to prevent any remaining German forces from escaping. Shortly after occupying the town, Nichols' squad and the other defending American units come under attack from a massive force of retreating Germans attempting to escape the Pocket. After much fighting and after retreating several times, Guzzo attempts to call for air support in order to destroy enemy positions, but his radio is destroyed by enemy fire. Resorting to using signal flares and braving heavy German fire, Guzzo is able to successfully mark the targets, but is wounded in the final target area. Nichols and Dixon are able to rescue him just as air support attacks the enemy targets, but Dixon is shot in the back just as they reach Allied lines. Shaken and enraged by Dixon's death, Guzzo takes command of the squad and leads them to aid the remaining American defenders to retake and defend the town just as air support and American reinforcements arrive, forcing the remaining German forces to surrender. Two days later, the squad members receive promotions, with Guzzo officially promoted to Sergeant and Nichols and Huxley being promoted to Corporal, and begin their march to liberate Paris. =British Campaign= In the British campaign, the player controls Sergeant James Doyle, a member of the Special Air Service (SAS), who alongside squad mates Corporal Duncan Keith, Wilkins, and Major Gerald Ingram, are parachuted into France in order to assist the Maquis Resistance in several operations to reduce the fighting capability of the German forces fighting in Normandy. Shortly before reaching their drop point near Toucy, France, the group's Handley Page Halifax is shot down, with Doyle and Wilkins being separated from the rest of their squad. Wilkins is executed shortly after landing and Doyle is rescued by Pierre LaRoche, the Maquis leader, before regrouping with Keith, Ingram, and resistance member Isabelle DuFontaine. After retrieving their two heavily armed jeeps, nicknamed \\"Vera\\" and \\"Lynn\\" respectively, Doyle and the group begin attacking several German position, including the anti-aircraft battery that had shot them down and assaulting a manor house that is serving as a German HQ in order to free a captured Maquis member, a man known only as Marcel. After escaping the area and regrouping, it is revealed that Marcel managed to steal the plans of a German held fuel plant before he was captured. Keith, who already holds great disdain for the resistance fighters and the French in general, immediately begins to butt heads with LaRoche, citing his lack of confidence in the Maquis and distrust of Marcel in particular. Using the captured plans, the SAS and Maquis launch a raid on the plant in order to destroy its fuel storage tanks and the production facilities. During the course of the raid the jeep \\"Vera\\" is severely damaged during the fighting and abandoned, and Doyle almost falls to his death during an altercation with a German soldier on one of the storage tanks. With the facility exploding around them, Doyle, Keith, and Marcel manage to escape the area, but the vehicle carrying Ingram is hit by German fire and Ingram is seemingly killed. Regrouping with LaRoche and DuFontaine sometime later, Keith berates LaRoche, who had left early during the raid, calling the Maquis leader a coward and outright accusing Marcel of being a German collaborator. Following the destruction of the fuel plant, the group receives information that Ingram is still alive and being held captive at a nearby village. Despite LaRoche's objections, Doyle and Keith lead a rescue mission on the village, and manage to rescue Ingram and several captured Maquis fighters from interrogation and execution, before fending off a German counterattack, during which Isabelle is killed when a satchel charge she is planting on an armored car detonates prematurely. Marcel, visibly saddened by her death, is comforted by Keith, who has finally learned to respect the Maquis and their bravery. =Canadian Campaign= In the Canadian campaign the player controls Private Cole of the 4th Canadian (Armored) Division, led by World War I veteran Lieutenant Jean- Guy Robichaud. Robichaud commands a platoon in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada, aided by Sergeant Jonathan Callard, squad member Private Kyle Peterson, and the squad's radio operator, Private Leslie Baron, who is continuously harassed by Robichaud for his lack of experience and habit of being seemingly absent during fighting. After their convoy is ambushed during a nighttime attack on a German-held industrial complex near Tilly-la- Campagne, the platoon proceeds to attack a German artillery battery on a nearby ridge, before moving on to capture the industrial complex and holding off an enemy counter-attack, destroying several German tanks in the process. The platoon later proceeds to clear a forested area near the Laison River of several anti-tank positions and a motor pool in order to clear the way for Allied convoys to move through the area. While advancing alongside other Canadian units to relieve Polish forces defending Hill 262, Baron is volunteered by Robichaud to be transferred to the Polish 1st Armored Division after the Polish unit's radio operator is killed. Fed up with Robichaud's abuse, Baron initially objects, stating that he is not a coward as Robichaud seems to believe, before storming off, much to Callard's concern. Cole's squad is then tasked to lead a rescue mission to free a captured Canadian tank crew in St. Lamber-sur-Dives, and with their help eventually capture the whole town. Shortly after freeing the tank crew, the squad comes under attack from a King Tiger tank. While attempting to flank the tank, the squad discovers a German munition stockpile in a cellar directly beneath the tank, and plant explosives to take out both the munitions and the tank. When the charges fail to detonate, Callard returns to the cellar and detonates the charges manually, destroying the King Tiger and dying in the process, with Cole and Robichaud being knocked out by the blast. Waking up sometime later, Cole is reunited with Robichaud and learns that Callard is being recommended for the Victoria Cross and that he is being promoted to Corporal. Shortly afterwards the unit moves out to help aid Canadian reinforcements advance to aid the Poles struggling to defend Hill 262. =Polish Campaign= The Polish campaign revolves around Corporal \\"Bohater\\" Wojciech, a Sherman Firefly tank driver in the Polish 1st Armored Division and his crew members, including Major Stan \\"Papa Jack\\" Jachowicz, Corporal Joakim \\"Lucky Rudd\\" Rudinski, Sergeant Łukasz \\"Bang Boom\\" Kowalski, and Private Marek \\"Beksa\\" Ulan. While aiding the Canadian and British forces in the area, Jachowicz's crew participates in a sweep across the French countryside, engaging German armored units while advancing to capture and occupy Hill 262, known as \\"The Mace\\" by the Polish. Bohater and his crew eventually track down and destroy an infamous Tiger II tank ace known as Richter \\"The Black Barron\\" (a reference to real life Tiger ace Michael Wittmann). Bohater and his crew then join in the defense of Hill 262 and endure a heavy assault by the remnants of the German 7th Army in their desperate attempt to escape the Falaise Pocket. Bohater's tank is destroyed shortly after the attack begins, forcing the crew to fight on foot alongside the Polish infantry. With their position overrun, Bohater and his crew continue to fight the Germans as they retreat towards the summit of Hill 262, during which Rudinski is killed. They are eventually joined by Canadian radio operator Baron, who along with Bohater provides artillery support in order to destroy several German tanks. As the crew continues to climb the hill, Baron refuses to retreat any further, having been deeply effected by Lieutenant Robichaud's constant teasing, and demands to stay and fight instead, while continually shouting that he \\"isn't a coward\\". Baron is killed by German fire while arguing with Ulan, who salvages the radio in order to continue providing artillery support. Upon reaching the top of the hill, the crew spots what they believe to be the Canadian reinforcements, only to realize it is instead a massive German counterattack, during which Rudinski is killed by a King Tiger tank. After much fighting, the Royal Canadian Air Force appears and repels the German forces as the Canadian reinforcements arrive at last, leaving Hill 262 firmly in Allied hands. Major Jachowicz meets with Lieutenant Robichaud after the battle and expresses his desire to collect the bodies of his men and return them to Poland, as well as stating his belief that the Germans will soon be defeated. However, Robichaud is quick to remind him that the Germans still have an escape route through Chambois should the Americans fail to stop them.

The game would be running on Treyarch's own internal engine, NGL. This game served as a launch title for the PlayStation 3 and Wii in North America, Europe and Australia. It was also the only major Call of Duty installment not to be released for personal computer platforms (though ports were planned yet cancelled) and the only numerical sequel to date to have been a console-exclusive game alongside Big Red One and Call of Duty: Finest Hour. In an interview with Video Gamer, Call of Duty: World at War senior producer, Noah Heller, revealed the team had eight months to develop Call of Duty 3.

A Kentucky native, at age 17 Laffoon moved to Washington, D.C., to live with his uncle, U.S. Representative Polk Laffoon. He developed an interest in politics and returned to Kentucky, where he compiled a mixed record of victories and defeats in elections at the county and state levels. In 1931, he was chosen as the Democratic gubernatorial nominee by a nominating convention, not a primary, making him the only Kentucky gubernatorial candidate to be chosen by a convention after 1903. In the general election, he defeated Republican William B. Harrison by what was then the largest margin of victory in Kentucky gubernatorial history. Dubbed \\"the terrible Turk from Madisonville,\\" Laffoon was confronted with the economic difficulties of the Great Depression. To raise additional revenue for the state treasury, he advocated the enactment of the state's first sales tax. This issue dominated most of his term in office and split the state Democratic Party and Laffoon's own administration. The lieutenant governor, A. B. \\"Happy\\" Chandler, led the fight against the tax in the legislature. After the tax was defeated in two regular legislative sessions and one specially called legislative session, Laffoon forged a bipartisan alliance to get the tax passed in a special session in 1934. Laffoon's feud with Lieutenant Governor Chandler continued throughout his term and affected the 1935 gubernatorial race. (At the time, the lieutenant governor was elected independently from the governor.) Term-limited by the state constitution, Laffoon supported political boss Tom Rhea to succeed him as governor, and convinced the Democrats to again hold a nominating convention to choose their gubernatorial nominee. This would have greatly improved Laffoon's chances of hand-picking his successor. While Laffoon was on a visit to Washington, D.C., Chandler was left as acting governor under the provisions of the Kentucky Constitution. Chandler issued a call for a special legislative session to consider a mandatory primary election bill. Laffoon rushed back to the state to invalidate the call, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld it as constitutional, and the primary law was passed. Chandler defeated Rhea in the primary, and went on to succeed Laffoon as governor. Following his term in office, Laffoon returned to his native Madisonville, where he died of a stroke in 1941. Among his gubernatorial legacies was appointing a record number of Kentucky colonels, including Harland Sanders, who used the title \\"Colonel\\" when he opened his chain of Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants. Early life Born in this log cabin, now in downtown Madisonville Ruby Laffoon was born on January 15, 1869, in a log cabin in Madisonville, Kentucky.Harrison and Klotter, p. 362 He was the third child and only son of John Bledsoe Laffoon, Jr. and Martha Henrietta (née Earle) Laffoon.Gipson, pp. 2-3 According to Laffoon biographer Vernon Gipson, his parents could not decide on a name for their new child, and for several years, referred to him only as \\"Bud\\". When he was a young child, Laffoon chose the name \\"Ruby\\" after John Edwin Ruby, a local businessman whose grocery store he frequently visited.Gipson, p. 4 The Laffoons were primarily farmers but also had some experience in politics.Gipson, p. 2 Ruby Laffoon's grandfather, John Bledsoe Laffoon, Sr., migrated to Kentucky from South Carolina in 1815 and served one term in the Kentucky House of Representatives. Ruby's father, John, Jr., served several terms as a deputy sheriff in Hopkins County and one term as county assessor. Ruby's uncle, Polk Laffoon, served two terms in the United States House of Representatives.Gipson, p. 3 Laffoon's early education was obtained in the public schools of Madisonville. While there, one of his teachers was his sister, Susan Isabella Laffoon, who was only 16 years old. At age 15, while plowing a field, Laffoon was kicked in the hip by a mule, requiring a six-week stay in a Nashville hospital. In the winter of the same year, he slipped on some ice and re-injured the hip. As a result of these injuries, his right leg was one-and-a-half inches shorter than his left leg, requiring him to wear special shoes and walk with a cane and a limp for the rest of his life. After his injury, Laffoon's parents decided that he could not make his living as a farmer and sent him to the private school of W. C. O'Bryan. By age 17, he was teaching in the common schools of Charleston in Hopkins County.Gipson, pp. 4-5 Legal and early political career In 1886, Laffoon moved to Washington, D.C. to live with his uncle, U.S. Representative Polk Laffoon.Powell, p. 92 There he served as a messenger in the office of Judge C. R. Faulkner, director of the pension office. In September 1887, he enrolled at Columbia Law School (asserted by Vernon Gipson to have been a prior designation for George Washington University Law School).\\"Kentucky Governor Ruby Laffoon\\". National Governors AssociationGipson, p. 8 On October 17, 1888, he matriculated to Washington and Lee University, where he earned a law degree in 1890.Gipson, p. 12 He returned to Madisonville, was admitted to the bar, and began practicing in the office of Judge William H. Yost. He became active in the Democratic Party and served as a county election officer.Gipson, p. 14 In 1892, he was elected city attorney of Madisonville over Ward Headley. In 1894, he ran for the office of county attorney for Hopkins County, but lost to Roy Salmon by seventeen votes.Gipson, p. 16 Laffoon married Mary \\"May\\" Bryant Nisbet on January 31, 1894 at, the Lucille Hotel in Madisonville. The couple had three daughters. Besides supporting her husband's political endeavors, May Laffoon was also active in politics. She was a delegate-at-large to every Democratic National Convention between 1932 and 1960, and actively campaigned for Franklin D. Roosevelt during his first run for the presidency. To supplement the family's income, Ruby Laffoon became a partner in the Madisonville branch of the Phoenix Insurance Company in 1897. He sold his interest in the company in 1901, the same year he made a second bid to become county attorney. He won the election over Thomas E. Finley by a vote of 3,335 to 2,910. In 1905, he was re-elected to his post, marking the first time in the history of Hopkins County that the county attorney had been re-elected.Gipson, pp. 14-19 In 1907, Laffoon sought the office of state treasurer. He faced no opposition in the Democratic primary, but the entire Democratic ticket was defeated in the general election.Gipson, p. 22 In 1911, he ran for state auditor, but lost in the primary to Henry Bosworth.Gipson, p. 24 That same year, he was elected as one of Hopkins County's delegates to the state Democratic convention.Gipson, p. 25 A bill passed in the state legislature in 1912 created a State Insurance Rating Board under the office of state auditor, and Bosworth appointed Laffoon chairman of the board due to his experience in the insurance field and as a reward for his loyalty to the party.Gipson, p. 26 In 1915, Laffoon sought the post of Commonwealth's Attorney for the Fourth Judicial District, which comprised Hopkins, Caldwell, Crittenden, and Livingston counties.Gipson, p. 27 He lost in the primary to J. Elliott Baker, but the Republican candidate, Charles Ferguson, won the general election. In September 1918, Laffoon moved to San Antonio, Texas, where he opened a law practice and managed a citrus fruit business near Galveston. Though he had intended this to be a permanent relocation, while on a visit to family a few months later, friends urged him to return to Kentucky, and he obliged after only three months in Texas. In 1921, he sought election to the bench of the Fourth District Circuit Court. In the primary, he defeated Trice Bennett, a candidate from Princeton, and went on to face Republican incumbent Carl Henderson of Marion. In the general election on November 8, 1921, Laffoon defeated Henderson, carrying every county in the district. In his first term, only 7 percent of his decisions were reversed by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which was a record for the Fourth District at the time. He was re-elected for a second six-year term in 1927.Gipson, pp. 28-31, 177 Governor of Kentucky In 1931, Laffoon sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.Harrison, p. 529 As a result of factional infighting within the Democratic party, the Democrats opted for a nominating convention instead of a primary to choose their nominee for governor.Gipson, pp. 38-39 It was the first nominating convention held by the Democrats since the Music Hall Convention that nominated William Goebel in 1899, and it was the only one held after 1903.Gipson, p. 38 The convention was held in Lexington on May 12, 1931.Gipson, p. 44 Laffoon gained the support of several important leaders within the party, including Ben Johnson, Thomas Rhea, M. M. Logan, Allie Young, and William J. Fields.Gipson, pp. 41-42 He was selected in a landslide over a myriad of candidates, including sitting lieutenant governor James Breathitt, Jr.Ellis, p. 164 and Centre College football hero James \\"Red\\" Roberts.\\"Announcements\\", The Davidsonian Despite his physical disability, Laffoon waged a vigorous campaign across the state. During campaign stops, he interspersed political commentary with passages from the Bible.Ellis, p. 165 The Louisville Courier-Journal objected to his campaign style and gave a tentative endorsement to the Republican William B. Harrison, the mayor of Louisville. Dubbed \\"the terrible Turk from Madisonville\\" by former Republican governor Edwin P. Morrow, Laffoon promised that, if elected, he would remove all of the Republican officials appointed by sitting governor Flem D. Sampson from state government. He cited the failed administration of Governor Sampson and the problem-filled presidency of Herbert Hoover as reasons to elect a Democrat. In the general election, Laffoon defeated Harrison by a margin of just over 72,000 votes, the largest margin of victory for any Kentucky governor at the time. Shortly after taking office, Laffoon organized the Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels, a charitable organization of people who had been commissioned as honorary Kentucky colonels.\\"Since 1813\\" During his term as governor, Laffoon commissioned 2,368 honorary colonels, the most ever by a Kentucky governor.\\"Kentucky Colonels\\" His best known commission was to Harland Sanders, who used the title \\"Colonel\\" when he opened his chain of Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants. Other colonels commissioned by Laffoon included Mae West, Shirley Temple, Clark Gable, Bing Crosby, Will Rogers, Fred Astaire, Jean Harlow, Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, Jack Dempsey and W. C. Fields.Gipson, p. 169 =Fight for a sales tax= Laffoon's administration was confronted by the economic difficulties of the Great Depression. While he proposed a number of improvements, money was not available in the state budget to implement his plans. In his first full year in office, he cut $11.5 million from the state budget, but it remained out-of-balance. The state issued additional interest- bearing warrants to cover its debts. In 1931, these warrants accounted for 24.2 percent of the state's receipts; by 1932, that number had climbed to 40.2 percent. In order to raise more funds, Laffoon proposed a 2 percent state sales tax in 1932. The proposal was extremely unpopular with merchants and private citizens, and it showed little promise of passing in the General Assembly.Klotter, p. 298 On March 2, 1932, a mob of 100 anti-tax protesters stormed the governor's mansion, damaging some items inside.Gipson, p. 77 In an attempt to get the tax passed, Laffoon agreed to seek only a 1 percent tax. The proposal passed the House, but a Senate committee refused to report it to the full chamber for a vote.Gipson, p. 78 Happy Chandler, Laffoon's lieutenant governor, opposed his call for a state sales tax. The sales tax proposal caused a rift in the Democratic party generally and in Laffoon's administration specifically. As presiding officer of the Senate, Lieutenant Governor A. B. \\"Happy\\" Chandler had led opposition to the tax in the legislature. Highway Commissioner Ben Johnson sided with Chandler, as did former Laffoon supporters Allie Young and J. Dan Talbott. In retaliation, Laffoon vetoed $7 million in appropriations and a measure to cut property taxes at the end of the legislative session. Among the few pieces of legislation that passed during the session were bills reorganizing the highway department, making the state Board of Charities a partisan entity, and further removing the Fish and Game Commission from the control of sportsmen. A redistricting bill was hastily passed at the end of the session, reducing the number of congressional districts from 11 to 9, per the most recent census results, but charges of gerrymandering kept the bill tied up in the courts, preventing it from taking effect in time for the 1932 congressional elections.Gipson, pp. 82-83 Consequently, all of Kentucky's representatives that year were elected at-large.Gipson, p. 83 The Louisville Courier-Journal called the 1932 legislative session \\"about the worst legislative session in Kentucky's history\\". Laffoon responded to the economic crisis by declaring a four-day banking holiday to begin on March 1, 1933.Gipson, p. 86 He twice extended the holiday, which finally ended on March 18.Gipson, p. 87 Responding to complaints of low prices by farmers, he closed burley tobacco markets in December of that year. At the end of the 1932 fiscal year, figures showed that the state incurred a $2 million deficit.Klotter, p. 300 Kentucky was also unable to secure significant financial assistance under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal because the state was often unable to raise the required matching funds. Though Laffoon was determined to pass a state sales tax, he vowed not to call a special legislative session to consider the issue.Ellis, p. 166 However, in August 1933, he did call a special session to debate a \\"gross receipts tax\\", which was essentially a sales tax by another name. Johnson and Chandler again led the opposition to Laffoon's plan; Laffoon called them, along with Allie Young and U.S. Representative John Y. Brown, Sr., \\"the most insidious lobby that ever infected the Capitol\\". He reportedly further charged that opposition to his tax program was financed by \\"a bunch of New York Jews\\". Despite Laffoon's rhetoric, the sales tax was again defeated. The General Assembly was split three ways when it convened in 1934. Approximately one-third of the Assembly was Republican, one-third was pro- Laffoon Democrats, and one third was anti-Laffoon Democrats. Using the promise of new roads in Republican districts as leverage, Laffoon and political boss Tom Rhea formed an alliance with the Republicans. The bipartisan alliance succeeded in enacting several measures to benefit education, including establishing a Council on Public Higher Education, extending the school year to six \\"or more\\" months, and mandating school attendance until age sixteen.Klotter, p. 301 Additional revenue was generated by increasing the tax on whiskey from 2 cents to 5 cents per gallon. Laffoon's bipartisan alliance also passed a governmental reorganization bill that reduced the number of state commissions and departments from 69 to 24, cutting several jobs from the state payroll. The real target of the bill, however, was Laffoon's political enemies. The bill curbed the powers of the lieutenant governor and state auditor, both Laffoon opponents. The lieutenant governor was removed from his post as president of the Kentucky Senate. The bill also empowered the governor to remove any appointed state official. Having neutralized opponents of the sales tax, Laffoon encouraged legislators to lower the state income and automobile taxes, which he believed would leave no alternative source of revenue except a sales tax. The General Assembly passed the requested cuts, and in July 1934, Laffoon called another special session to consider the sales tax. Pro-administration officials organized parades and demonstrations in favor of the tax. By contrast, a group of 100 unemployed men marched on Frankfort demanding financial relief.Klotter, p. 302 Some of them made death threats against Laffoon, and the Kentucky National Guard surrounded the governor's mansion to protect him. Although anti-sales-tax forces used parliamentary procedures that stalled a vote for weeks, a three percent sales tax was approved by the end of the session. The tax was derided in a children's chant that said \\"Hippity-hop to the toy shop to buy a red balloon. A penny for you, a penny for me, a penny for Ruby Laffoon.\\" Following the special session, Laffoon was admitted to a sanatorium, where he was treated for exhaustion. =Role in the 1935 gubernatorial race= As his term neared expiration, Laffoon removed Ben Johnson from his post as highway commissioner, replacing him with Tom Rhea.Ellis, pp. 166-167 This move was made in order to groom Rhea to be the next governor.Ellis, p. 167 Due to the influence of Laffoon and Rhea, the Democratic Party again chose a nominating convention in lieu of a primary to choose their gubernatorial candidate. Because Laffoon supporters controlled the state Democratic Central Committee and most of the county political organizations, a convention would favor Laffoon's choice of gubernatorial nominee.Gipson, p. 139 The convention was scheduled for May 14, 1935 in Lexington.Gipson, p. 141 On January 5, 1935, Laffoon traveled to Washington, D.C. to meet with President Roosevelt. Although Laffoon said the purpose of his trip was to discuss further federal aid for Kentucky, his opponents maintained he had gone to explain the lack of a primary to the president. (Roosevelt had written a letter to the state Democratic Central Committee encouraging them to adopt a primary.) Due to Laffoon's absence from the state, Lieutenant Governor Chandler was left as acting governor under the provisions of the Kentucky Constitution.Klotter, p. 303 On February 6, Chandler issued a proclamation calling a special session of the legislature on February 8 to consider a bill requiring a primary election to select nominees for all state offices. Laffoon rushed back to the state, arriving in Ashland on February 7, and immediately issued a proclamation revoking Chandler's call. Franklin County legislator John Gatewood obtained an injunction against Laffoon's order, and pro-primary legislators gathered in Frankfort on February 8. These members failed to achieve a quorum on February 8, 9, and 11. On February 11, six legislators sought a declaratory judgment to see if Laffoon's revocation was legal. The Franklin County Circuit Court upheld Chandler's call and invalidated Laffoon's revocation, and the Kentucky Court of Appeals, then the court of last resort in the state, upheld this decision by a 4–3 majority.Gipson, pp. 141-146 On February 13, the Kentucky House achieved a quorum, and the Senate did so the following day.Gipson, p. 148 Having lost the battle against the special session, Laffoon proposed a primary with a run-off if no candidate received a majority on the first ballot. Some, including Chandler, believed this action was aimed against former governor and senator J. C. W. Beckham, who Laffoon believed would challenge Rhea for the Democratic nomination. They believed that a double primary would be too much for the aging Beckham to endure.Klotter, p. 304 Supporters of a single primary found they did not have the votes in the legislature to pass it, so they agreed to a double primary, which Laffoon signed into law on February 27, 1935.Gipson, p. 150 Seven candidates declared their candidacy for the Democratic nomination, including Rhea and Lieutenant Governor Chandler.Gipson, pp. 150-151 Former governor Beckham was not a candidate; his only son had died in late 1934, devastating his family and leaving his wife strongly opposed to another political campaign. Near the end of the primary campaign, Laffoon suffered an attack of appendicitis and required an appendectomy, leaving him unable to campaign for Rhea.Gipson, p. 152 Two candidates dropped out of the race prior to the election.Gipson, p. 153 On the day of the primary, Adjutant General Denhardt took National Guard troops into Harlan County, which was known for its history of election violence. The troops questioned voters, examined ballot boxes, and made several arrests. These actions were in direct violation of a restraining order issued by circuit court judge James M. Gilbert, but Denhardt claimed to be acting on orders from Laffoon. Denhardt later reported that \\"We stopped the most stupendous, well-planned election steal ever attempted in Kentucky. Chandler would have gotten 15,000 votes had we not been here.\\" Denhardt was later arrested and charged with contempt of court for violating the restraining order.Gipson, pp. 153, 156 In the primary, Rhea achieved a plurality of the votes, but not a majority.Harrison, p. 530 Chandler had the next highest vote total, and the two faced each other in a run-off on September 7, 1935.Gipson, p. 154 In the run-off, Chandler defeated Rhea, securing the nomination for governor. President Roosevelt, not wanting Democratic factionalism to cost him votes in the 1936 presidential election, attempted to bring together the Laffoon and Chandler factions, but to little avail.Gipson, pp. 158-160 Laffoon and Rhea, along with most of Laffoon's administration, bolted the party and supported Republican nominee King Swope.Harrison and Klotter, p. 368 Despite losing the support of his predecessor, Chandler went on to win the general election.Harrison, pp. 529-530 In his last days in office, Laffoon issued pardons for Denhardt and others charged in connection with the National Guard's interference with the primary in Harlan County.Gipson, p. 163 These were among a record 560 pardons issued by Laffoon, most of which were to relieve prison crowding. Later life During his gubernatorial campaign, Laffoon had promised not to seek higher office if elected governor.Gipson, p. 40 Term-limited by the state constitution, he returned to private life following his four years in office. On the day of Chandler's inauguration, Laffoon said \\"I'm going to Madisonville right after the inauguration, and I hope to get some clients at my law office by Wednesday morning.\\"Gipson, p. 166 Shortly after Chandler's inauguration, attorney general Beverly M. Vincent opined that Kentucky Colonel commissions expired at the end of the commissioning governor's term. Laffoon vigorously defended the commissions he had issued and those issued by his predecessors. On April 27, 1936, when both Governor Chandler and Lieutenant Governor Keen Johnson attended a baseball game in Cincinnati, President Pro Tem of the Senate James Eugene Wise was left as acting governor and recommissioned all 17,000 existing colonels.Gipson, p. 168 Laffoon was a member of the Democratic National Committee in 1936, but decided not to attend the national convention. He chose Urey Woodson to serve as his proxy, but Woodson declined to attend as well and turned the proxy over to Fred M. Vinson. Laffoon also backed Senator M. M. Logan's re-election bid in 1936. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1940, and despite his differences with President Roosevelt during his gubernatorial term, he supported Roosevelt's re- election.Gipson, p. 171-171 Defying a doctor's order not to work for two weeks due to high blood pressure, Laffoon presided for three days as a special judge in the Union County Circuit Court in February 1941.Gipson, p. 173 On February 17, 1941, he returned home early from his law office due to a bout of dizziness. It was reported that he had suffered a stroke, and after a mild improvement, his condition worsened again and he died on March 1, 1941, at 2:50 am.Gipson, pp. 173-174 He was buried in Grapevine Cemetery in Madisonville.

Tuareg people at the January 2012 festival. The Festival au désert (\\"Festival in the Desert\\") was an annual concert in Mali, showcasing traditional Tuareg music as well as music from around the world. The first Festival took place in 2001 in Tin Essako, then in Tessalit in 2002, and in Essakane from 2003 to 2009. From 2010 to 2012 it was held on the outskirts of Timbuktu because of security concerns which have prevented it from taking place since. Several film documentaries have been made about or at the festival: Le Festival au Désert (2004), Dambé: The Mali Project (2008), The Last Song Before the War (2013) and Woodstock in Timbuktu (2013). The album Festival au Desert Live from Timbuktu (2013) has performances from the 2012 festival. Details The first Festival took place in Tin Essako in 2001 and then it moved in 2002 to Tessalit in the Kidal region of North-Eastern Mali. From 2003 until 2009 the festival was held in Essakane, 65 km from Timbuktu, but because of security issues, from 2010 the festival was held on the outskirts of Timbuktu. The Tuareg band Tinariwen first garnered international attention with their performance at the 2001 Festival. An audio recording of the 2012 edition Festival au Desert Live from Timbuktu was released in 2013 with performances by 18 artists with supplemental digital bonus performances. Shortly after the January 2012 festival, the MNLA launched the Azawadi rebellion, an early stage of the Northern Mali conflict, resulting in the postponement of the 2013 festival. In July and August 2013, Tartit, Imharhan, and Mamadou Kelly toured throughout North America as the Festival au Desert - Caravan for Peace. The Festival has continued to be postponed due to security concerns in the region. Documentary films A French-language documentary entitled Le Festival au Désert (2004) was filmed at the 2003 festival. Performers include Tartit, Oumou Sangaré, Lo'Jo, Tinariwen, Robert Plant with Justin Adams, Blackfire, Khaira Arby and her band, Django, and Ali Farka Touré. The DVD contains English subtitles, and an audio CD of the concert, Festival in the Desert, was also released. The documentary Dambé: The Mali Project (2008) tells the story of a cross-cultural musical adventure over 3000 miles by two Irish musicians, that features performances from the Festival au désert. Other documentary films made about the Festival are The Last Song Before the War (2013) and Woodstock in Timbuktu (2013).

CareerJournalism= Mayne worked for a number of media outlets and was a media adviser to the Premier of Victoria Jeff Kennett between 1992 and 1994. In 1997 Mayne appeared on ABC TV's Four Corners as a whistleblower about Kennett's share dealings. In 1999 Mayne started the website jeffed.com devoted to complaints about Kennett in support of Mayne's abortive candidacy in the 1999 election. He is best known for founding Crikey in 2000, an online independent news service. The combination of gossip and anti-establishment reporting got Mayne into legal (and consequent financial) trouble several times. Despite considerable financial pressures, Mayne persisted and Crikey gradually attracted subscribers and a fair degree of notoriety. It was announced on 1 February 2005 that Crikey had been sold for A$1 million to another independent media operator, Private Media Partners. Mayne continues to write for Crikey and was a regular business commentator on ABC Radio. Mayne also regularly runs for elections to the board of directors of various Australian public companies to draw attention to issues concerning good corporate governance. He is also a trenchant critic of what he perceives as excessive conflicts of interest in corporate and political Australia. In October 2007, Mayne launched The Mayne Reporta website that is focused on shareholder activism and corporate governance issues. =Politics= In 1999, Mayne resigned from his job at The Australian Financial Review in order to run against then Premier of Victoria Jeff Kennett as an independent protest candidate. After moving to Melbourne and making preparations for the campaign, he discovered he was unable to run because he was not enrolled, and not even entitled to be enrolled. Years later he tearfully told the ABC's Talking Heads that his father disowned him at this point, telling him not to return until he had got a job. Mayne later ran as an independent in a subsequent Burwood by- election, caused by Kennett's resignation from politics after his 1999 state election loss. Mayne attracted a primary vote of 1,975 votes (6.63%), and Labor's Bob Stensholt won the seat. He later came to be central to the formation of the People Power party and became its largest financial supporter. The Age reported that he \\"would play a key role in recruiting, organising and funding the People Power campaign.\\" In 2001, he ran as a candidate for the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, losing to John So; and in 2006 he ran as the lead Southern Metropolitan Upper House candidate for the People Power party. However, after a poor election showing, People Power folded amid much acrimony and Mayne resolved only to operate independently in future elections. At the 2007 federal election, Mayne ran as an independent for the seat of Higgins against incumbent deputy Liberal leader and treasurer Peter Costello. He received a primary vote of 1.98 percent (1,615 votes). On 30 November 2008, Mayne was elected to the Heide Ward in the Manningham City Council in Melbourne. In October 2012 he was elected to Melbourne City Council where he currently serves as chair of the Finance and Governance Committee and deputy chair of the Transport committee. He spent 3 years as deputy chair of the Planning Committee until late 2015. Mayne ran as an Independent for the Northern Metropolitan Region in the 2010 Victorian state election, winning a primary vote of almost 1 per cent. Media reports at the time had him in with a chance to win the balance of power but he failed to pull ahead of either Family First or the Green surplus and the final spot went to Liberal Craig Ondarchie. Mayne came fourth of sixteen candidates with 4.7 per cent of the vote as an independent at the 2012 Melbourne state by-election. He recommended preferences to the Greens, however Labor retained the seat with a 51.5 per cent two-candidate preferred vote. =Shareholder activism= Mayne calls himself \\"Australia's most unsuccessful candidate\\", largely because of 48 unsuccessful tilts at public company boards since 2000. Between 2011 and 2014, Mayne worked for the Australian Shareholders Association, first as a volunteer director and later as a paid consultant performing the role of spokesman and Policy and Engagement Coordinator. During this time he collectively advocated for improved corporate governance amongst publiclylisted companies. Mayne has asked questions at more than 400 AGMs since 1998 and left the ASA to return to individual shareholder activism in September 2014. Walkley Awards incident Australian journalism's most prestigious night descended into a shambles when Glenn Milne pushed Mayne off the stage at the 2006 Walkley Awards. As Mayne prepared to present an award to Morgan Mellish of The Australian Financial Review, a \\"red-faced\\" and \\"seemingly intoxicated\\" Milne lurched onto the stage and began a diatribe of verbal abuse. On national television, Milne then lunged at Mayne, pushing him off the stage, and screaming at Mayne that he was \\"a disgrace\\". Milne tried to run at Mayne a second time before being restrained by security guards, who frogmarched the disheveled Milne out the door. Mayne then gathered himself at the microphone, quipping, \\"That is the former Sunday Telegraph political correspondent Glenn Milne, sponsored by Fosters.\\" Recalling the incident, where he suffered a sore ankle from the altercation, Mayne stated: The following day, Milne apologised for the outburst, saying he was affected by a mixture of alcohol and migraine pills. Personal life Mayne is married to lawyer Paula Piccinini, who helped him run Crikey for 5 years, and they have two daughters and a son. His sister-in- law, Patricia Piccinini, is one of Australia's best-known contemporary artists. His grandfather was the World War I veteran and British centenarian Philip Mayne.

Miller worked in the United States Government wartime mail censorship office. Miller was allegedly recruited into espionage for the Soviet Union by Isaac Folkoff of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA). His cover name was \\"Vague\\". Born Milawski in Russia, he changed his name to Miller after coming to the United States in 1907. He became a member of the Communist Party in Los Angeles. Miller was associated with Victor Milo while in the California Communist Party. Miller at one time worked for Russky Golos (Russian Voice), the American-Russian Institute, and People's World. Miller was one of Folkoff's most valuable agents. Miller spoke Russian, and was a Russian- language translator with the financial and trade section of the U.S. government wartime mail censorship office. Miller worked in an area of considerable interest to Soviet intelligence. In 1943 Folkoff passed on to the KGB material from Miller on several occasions. San Francisco Rezident Grigory Kheifets attested to Miller's bone fides in a Venona decrypt, putting to rest reservations from Moscow that because of Miller's eagerness, he may be a double agent. Miller began passing information to Harrison George at the People's World. In 1943 Miller reported the Mail Censor's office found secret writing in a letter that a Naval GRU Officer sent to Moscow. In 1944 Miller came to the attention of the FBI in the \\"Comintern Apparatus\\" investigation. The FBI witnessed Miller meeting Kheifets at least six times in early 1944. Miller was eventually forced out of the government office. He died in 1950.

Biography  Early life and education = Born in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, as Madeline Mezz, she was the only child of a doctor and an opera singer. She received the nickname \\"Bunny\\" as a child, as she recalled, \\"My mother and father called me Bunny from day one. They said I was little and cute and had dark eyes like a little bunny.\\" Her father, Dr. David Mezz, was a surgeon who invented the nose clip used by springboard divers.Donovan, Dick. \\"Cartoonist's wedded bliss far cry from Lockhorns,\\" The Palm Beach Post, April 22, 1979, p. C1. Copquin, Claudia Gryvatz. \\"Bunny Hoest: Life On and Off the Funny Pages,\\" Newsday, August 2,, 2008. After attending a magnet school as a music student for four years, she graduated in 1953 from Adelphi University, where she studied literature and creative writing, noting, “I feel that writing is a gift which should be perfected. English is a beautiful language. Why muck it up?”Adelphi University: Alumni Profiles = First marriage = When she was 19, she married Ted Jungreis, and the couple moved to Huntington, Long Island, where she raised three children. With a master's degree in secondary education from C. W. Post, she taught English as a second language. She joined a local community theater, where she composed original scores for three musical comedies, in addition to singing, dancing, and directing the music in productions of Gypsy, Damn Yankees, Guys and Dolls, South Pacific, and other musical comedies. During this time, she also became a member of the Huntington Choral Society. = Comic strip writing career = Mezz and Jungreis separated after 21 years together, and not long after that, she landed a job with cartoonist Bill Hoest, creator of The Lockhorns, who needed an assistant to help compile his cartoons into books. She recalled, \\"I was 40 years old. My kids were 20, 18, and 15.\\" Hoest, who had six children, was also recently divorced. The two married in 1973. She reflected, \\"Marrying Bill meant taking on a whole different kind of life, a new direction with much responsibility. He needed a working partner as well as a marriage partner. It was scary and challenging. I thought, what the hell, I'll give it a shot.\\" Soon she was writing captions for The Lockhorns, and eventually they worked together on the scripts for their other features. After Bill Hoest's death in 1988, she continued the cartoons and strips, working closely with illustrator John Reiner, who began as Bill Hoest's assistant in 1986. They usually work three or four months in advance of publication. In 2001, Marcelle S. Fischer, in The New York Times, profiled Long Island's cartoonists, including Bunny Hoest: According to King Features, Bunny Hoest had 200 million readers each week, a total derived from The Lockhorns (500 newspapers worldwide), Laugh Parade (80 million readers each Sunday) and the long-running Bumper Snickers for The National Enquirer (which has a circulation of more than seven million). Bumper Snickers began in 1974 and was collected in a Signet paperback two years later.

A clarinet quintet is a work for one clarinet and a string quartet. Although originally written for basset clarinet,Oxford Music Online, \\"Basset clarinet\\", Nicholas Shackleton in contemporary performances it is usually played on a clarinet in A. It was Mozart's only completed clarinet quintet, and is one of the earliest and best-known works written especially for the instrument. It remains to this day one of the most admired of the composer's works. The quintet is sometimes referred to as the Stadler Quintet; Mozart so described it in a letter of April 1790.Einstein (1945), p. 194 Mozart also wrote a trio for clarinet, viola and piano for Stadler, the so-called Kegelstatt Trio, in 1786. Composition and premiere The composer indicated that the work was finished on 29 September 1789.Quintett in A KV 581: Score, Neue Mozart-Ausgabe It received its premiere on 22 December of the same year, in one of the four annual Vienna performances of the Tonkünstler-Societät, an organization that existed to fund pensions for widows and orphans of musicians. The main item on the program was a cantata, Il natale d'Apollo, by Vincenzo Righini; Mozart's work was performed between the two halves of this work. The solo clarinet part was taken by Stadler, the first violin part by Joseph Zistler (1744–1794). Structure The work consists of the following four movements and, with the intended repetitions, has a duration of between 31 and 38 minutes, usually around 35 minutes. 1st movement: Allegro,The C. F. Peters Leipzig edition of the score marks the movement as Allegretto A major, time = 4/4, 197 bars, where bars 1 to 79 and bars 80 to 197 are repeated. This movement shows the typical sonata form with exposition, development and recapitulation. 2nd movement: Larghetto, D major, time = 3/4, 85 bars 3rd movement: Menuetto with Trio I in A minor and Trio II in A major, time = 3/4, 31 + 41 + 51 bars. Here, too, the individual sections are repeated. 4th movement: Allegretto con variazioni, A major (Variation III in C major), time = 2/2. The presentation of the theme with 16 bars is followed by four variations with three times 16 and one time 20 bars. This is followed by two basically independent small movements: an Adagio with 21 bars and an Allegro with 36 bars. Here, too, repetition of the individual sections. =First movement= The first movement sets the mood for the entire piece. It has beautiful moving lines in all of the parts and in the second half there is a virtuoso run that is passed throughout the strings, based on material from the second section of the exposition. : \\\\relative c { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"violin\\" \\\\tempo \\"Allegro\\" \\\\tempo 4 = 126 \\\\key a \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 e2( cis  b a)  b4( cis d b)  gis2( a)  fis4( a e a)  e2 d4.(\\\\startTrillSpan cis16\\\\stopTrillSpan d)  cis4 } :Main theme =Second movement= The second movement opens with a six-bar transition in place of a central development section, which opposes a first section consisting mostly of a clarinet melody over muted strings against a second group of themes in which – as in the first movement – several upward runs of scales are given to the first violin, alternating with brief phrases of clarinet melody. These scales are given to the clarinet in the recapitulation (bar 51). In the last few bars of the movement, more chromatic than the rest, the scales turn into triplet arpeggios traded between the strings under the closing clarinet phrases. =Third movement= The third movement consists of a minuet and, unusually, two trios. The first trio is for the strings alone, with a theme that has a signature acciaccatura every few notes. The second trio is a clarinet solo over the strings, whereas in the minuet the roles are distributed more evenly. =Fourth movement= The finale is in variation form, unexpectedly substituting for the more conventional rondo.Warrack, p. 3 There are five variations. The theme is in two repeated halves, with the clarinet joining in but only for a few of its bars. As often with Mozart, phrase structure is generally the same throughout the variations even if other qualities change – the theme consists of four four-bar phrases (Mozart is often more irregular in his phrasing than this), the first going harmonically from A to E, the second back from E to A, etc. and likewise with the variations. The first of its variations gives the clarinet a new theme, in counterpoint with the theme of the variations divided amongst the quartet. The second alternates phrases for quartet only with phrases for full quintet, the latter answering the former. The third, in A minor, also begins without clarinet, with a viola melody – also with signature acciaccatura – but the clarinet joins in to finish. The major mode returns for the fourth variation, as does the main theme to the accompaniment of semiquaver virtuosity – given to the clarinet only in the first repeated half, first violin and clarinet in the second. There are four bars of dramatic interruption leading to a pause; the next variation is a lyrical Adagio. A transition brings us to an Allegro coda, containing much of a variation itself. : \\\\relative c { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"violin\\" \\\\key a \\\\major \\\\time 2/2 \\\\tempo \\"Allegretto con Variazioni\\" \\\\tempo 4 = 109 e4-.\\\\p e-. cis-. cis-. d8.

Both are in the key of A major and were written for the same soloist, Anton Stadler. Both pieces are written for the basset clarinet, which has an extended lower range. Also, the first theme of the first movement of each piece begins with a falling minor third. Both the second movements are in the same key (D major) and have similar characters and many similar phrases, although they have different tempo markings. There is a direct quotation of two bars in the second movement of the Quintet of the clarinet line in the Concerto's second movement. Alfred EinsteinEinstein (1945), p. 194 notes that while the clarinet \\"predominates as primus inter pares\\" (first amongst equals) this is nonetheless \\"chamber music work of the finest kind\\" and the roles are distributed more equally than they would be in a more concertante quintet for wind and strings. Fragment second Clarinet Quintet A score fragment exists for a second (though possibly written first) clarinet quintet in B-flat major, of which a complete exposition survives. It is possible that Mozart completed the movement, as the score continues into the development section on the last surviving page. This fragment is unlikely to be a sketch, as it bears no marks of correction. Nevertheless, the quintet K. 581 in A major is Mozart's sole surviving complete work for clarinet quintet. In popular culture In \\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\\", the final episode of the American television series M*A*S*H, Charles Winchester learns that five Chinese soldiers who surrendered to him are musicians, one of whom plays a theme from the Clarinet Quintet, and Winchester proceeds to teach them the entire piece.

His long term legacy is still to be assessed, but through his work to date he has made a significant contribution to the Australian music tradition.Cotter (2004a) p. 6.  Life and career  Larry Sitsky was born in Tianjin (formerly Tientsin), China, of Russian-Jewish émigré parents. He demonstrated perfect pitch at an early age, by identifying notes or chords played in a different room. He studied piano from an early age, gave his first public concert at the age of nine, and started writing music soon thereafter. His family was forced to leave China during Mao's rule. They came to Australia in 1951 and settled in Sydney.Cotter (2004a) p. 5. He had sat for Cambridge University Overseas Matriculation before leaving China. His first studies at university were in engineering, at his parents' insistence. This was not successful and \\"he convinced his parents to allow him to pursue his passion, music\\". He obtained a scholarship to the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music, where he studied piano, briefly with Alexander SverjenskyCotter (2004b) p. 32. but mainly with Winifred Burston (a student of Ferruccio Busoni and Egon Petri), and composition, graduating in 1955. In 1959, he won a scholarship to the San Francisco Conservatory, where he studied with Egon Petri for two years. Returning to Australia, he joined the staff of the Queensland Conservatorium of Music, after being accepted sight unseen based on a recommendation from Petri. His Australian studies and his subsequent studies in the United States, \\"combined with the Russian heritage from his early studies in China, [make] him a unique repository of piano techniques and tradition which is acknowledged internationally\\". A grant from the Myer Foundation in 1965 enabled him to conduct research into the music of Ferruccio Busoni, on whom he has written extensively. In 1966 he was appointed Head of Keyboard Studies at the Canberra School of Music, was later Head of Musicology and was Head of Composition Studies. He is currently Emeritus Professor of the Australian National University in Canberra. Sitsky has always performed as well as composed, and as a student won performance awards. He believes that composers should perform, believing that \\"without this communion with a live audience, music-making all too easily becomes over- intellectualised, sterile and arid\\". As a performer, he champions twentieth- century repertoire. In terms of composition, Sitsky has regularly changed his musical language to \\"express himself in ways that are not familiar and 'easy'\\". Larry Sitsky attracted attention when he, among others, criticised the Keating government for giving successive artistic fellowships to the pianist Geoffrey Tozer. He explained that his criticism was not personal against Tozer, who was a friend of his, but that it was a matter of principle. A biography of Sitsky was published in the USA in 1997. Listen to the interview with an Australian composer, pianist, and music educator and scholar Larry Sitsky on SBS Radio, Australia in Russian (Presented by Tina Vassiliev)Russian  Pусский  Awards and honours  Sitsky was the first Australian to be invited to the USSR on a cultural exchange visit, organised by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs in 1977. He has received many awards for his compositions: the Albert H. Maggs Composition Award in 1968, and again in 1981; the Alfred Hill Memorial Prize for his String Quartet in 1968; a China Fellowship in 1983; a Fulbright Award in 1988–89, and an Advance Australia Award for achievement in music (1989). He has also been awarded the inaugural prize from the Fellowship of Composers (1989), the first National Critics' Award, and the inaugural Australian Composers' Fellowship presented by the Music Board of the Australia Council, which gave him the opportunity to write a large number of compositions (including concerti for violin, guitar, and orchestra), to revise his book Busoni and the Piano, and to commence work as a pianist on the Anthology of Australian Piano Music. In 1997 the Australian National University awarded him its first Higher Doctorate in Fine Arts. In 1998, he was elected Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. He is currently a Distinguished Visiting Fellow, as well as Emeritus Professor at the Australian National University. In 2000 he was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for service to music as a composer, musicologist, pianist and educator; and in the same year he received the Centenary Medal for service to Australian society through music. In 2017 Sitsky was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for distinguished service to the arts as a composer and concert pianist, to music education as a researcher and mentor, and through musical contributions to Australia's contemporary culture.  Works  Sitsky has published the two-volume The Classical Reproducing Piano Roll and Music of the Repressed Russian Avant- Garde, 1900–1929, and has recorded a number of CDs of Australian piano music, including the complete sonatas of Roy Agnew. He has had works commissioned by many leading Australian and international bodies, such as the ABC, Musica Viva Australia, the International Clarinet Society, the Sydney International Piano Competition, Flederman and the International Flute Convention. His collection of teaching pieces, Century, has been published by Currency Press, and he also has an open contract to publish anything he wishes with his New York publisher, Seesaw Music Corporation. In August 2011, Sitsky announced plans to write a series of operas based on the stories of Enid Blyton. The works were premiered by the ANU School of Music.

Egharevba (1893–1981) was a Bini historian and traditional chief whose writings specialized in the history of Benin Kingdom. LifeEarly life= Egharevba was born in Idanre, Ondo State, His father was related to Ohenmwen, Iyase of Benin and his mother, Okunzuwa was the granddaughter of Ogie Ezomo I. His father was a trader but died in 1902. Egharevba spent part of his early childhood at the residence of his aunt in Idanre. His education was brief and irregular, he spent a year at St James' CMS School, Ibadan in 1899 and then an interval where he was out of school. He returned to studies at St David's School, Akure in 1911 before moving to St. Mathews, Benin. As a young boy, he worked part-time as a helper on canoes ferrying goods for sale between Benin Division and nearby cities. After finishing studies, Egharevba held a few low paying jobs. He worked as a water rate clerk in Benin but left the job in 1917 to work for the Public Works Department. In 1922, he began trading goods in Benin and Sapele. During this period, he became close to the family of Oba Akenzua II. His friendship with the royal family allowed him access to senior informants who had knowledge of Benin's oral history. =Professional career= In 1921, Egharevba wrote the draft of his first book, Ekhere vb Itan Edo later known as The Short History of Benin. The book was published c.1933 by CMS Press and was very successful. His first four publications were in the Edo language, but he switched to English in 1934 due to its widespread use and the effect on commercial appeal. He followed his first book with Benin Law and Custom, published in 1934. Egharevba's knowledge of Benin history, laws and customs was used in Native Court cases where he served as consultant on Benin traditions. Apart from writing books, he contributed articles to newspapers and wrote petitions to the colonial government. In 1934, he started a printing press in Benin. Egharevba was appointed the curator of the Benin Museum in 1946. While working as a curator, he was also a prolific writer, having written 28 books by 1968. In 1973, 13 of his works were published in two volumes. Works Egharevba's most famous work is A Short History of Benin. Published in different editions, it has major differences in some paragraphs between the editions. His books which documented the oral history and culture of Benin cut across different disciplines but the main content deals with issues, events, institutions, practices and personalities in Benin history. A lot of his early writings from 1934 to 1948 dealt with documentation of oral history, folklore and customs to instill moral values in young people. Afterwards, he included commentaries about contemporary issues and personalities in Benin history in his writings. However, some of the materials are repetitive, re-stating statements from his earlier works. =Selected writings= * A Short History of Benin. * Benin Law and Custom. * Concise Lives of the Famous Iyases of Benin. * The murder of Imaguero and tragedy of Idah War * Benin games and sports * Urod d'Agbon * Ihun-an Edo vb'Obo * Some Stories of Ancient Benin * Some Tribal gods of Southern Nigeria * Ozedu-Interpreter * The origin of Benin * Bini Titles * Amazevbo Omwan Tawiri * A Brief History of the Life of Gauis Obaseki * Marriage of the Princesses of Benin * Ere Ede vb'Obo * Ominigbon vb'Obo * Chronicle of Events in Benin * Fusion of Tribes * Some prominent Bini people * Egharevba family * A Brief Autobiography * Descriptive catalogue of Benin Museum * A Brief Life History of Evian * Itan Edagbon Mwen * Okhuaihe of Ikhuen * The Ake of Isi NotesSources * Category:1893 births Category:1981 deaths Category:Nigerian historians Category:Edo people Category:20th-century historians ","title":"Jacob U.

He pitched his entire career in the American League with the Cleveland Indians, Washington Senators, New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. Bill was born and raised in Middle Amana, Iowa, a community of German pietists who until 1932 practiced a form of communitarian living. Playing career Indians= Zuber made his professional debut in 1932, and joined the Zanesville Greys of the Middle Atlantic League, a minor league team in the Indians' organization, in 1933. After several more seasons in the minor leagues, Zuber spent most of the 1936 season playing for the Greys, finishing with a 17–8 record and over 200 strikeouts. He made his Major League debut on September 16, 1936 with the Cleveland Indians. In his first game against the Boston Red Sox, he pitched five innings and earned a win in the six-inning affair which was shortened due to rain. After starting a second game and finishing the season with one win and one loss, he spent the 1937 season playing for the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association. He rejoined the Indians during the 1938 and 1939 seasons, and was used as a relief pitcher. In the two seasons, he posted a 2–3 record and finished 16 games. He finished the 1940 season with a 1–1 record, and on April 21, 1941, the Washington Senators purchased his contract from the Indians. =Senators and Yankees= Zuber spent two seasons with the Senators, starting seven games and finishing 19 both seasons. He was classified 4-F by the military, and as a result was able to remain with the team during World War II. In 1942, he won a career high nine games. On January 29, 1943, Zuber was traded to the Yankees with cash for Jerry Priddy and Milo Candini. The 1943 New York Yankees went on to win the world series, with Zuber finishing the season with an 8–4 record over 20 games, which included 13 starts and 7 complete games. He did not pitch in the 1943 World Series. He remained an occasional starter the following two seasons, winning five games in both seasons and earning a 3.19 earned run average in 1945. Although he only posted a 5–11 record for the season, the Yankees were shutout 14 times during the season, seven when Zuber was pitching, a club record. =Boston Red Sox= At the start of the 1946 New York Yankees season, Zuber pitched three games and had an ERA of over 12 before he was purchased by the Boston Red Sox on June 18. He went on to post a 5–1 record and a career-low 2.54 ERA during the remainder of the season. On September 21, Zuber won a game against the Senators, which gave the Red Sox their 100th victory of the season. Zuber appeared in game four of the 1946 World Series, pitching two innings and allowing one run in a 12–3 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. After pitching 20 games during the 1947 season, Zuber returned to the minor leagues for a season, pitching for the Louisville Colonels in 1948, before retiring. Life after baseball After retirement, Zuber started a restaurant in Homestead, Iowa of the Amana Colonies in 1949. Zuber died in Cedar Rapids, Iowa on November 2, 1982.

Patrick M. Byrne founded Overstock.com in 1999. The company initially sold exclusively surplus and returned merchandise on an online e-commerce marketplace, liquidating the inventories of at least 18 failed dot-com companies at below-wholesale prices. The company continues to sell home decor, furniture, bedding, and many other goods that are closeout merchandise; however, it also sells new merchandise. In May 2002, Overstock held an IPO at a per-share price of $13; furthermore, after achieving significant growth and profits in some early quarters, the company achieved a profit of $7.7 million in 2009 and reported its first billion-dollar year in 2010. The business started rebranding in early 2011, as \\"O.co\\", to simplify and unify its international operations but interrupted this effort a few months later, citing consumer confusion over the new name. Business model and management Part of Overstock.com's merchandise is purchased by or manufactured specifically for the company. Among their products are handmade goods produced for Overstock by workers in developing nations. The company also manages the inventory supply for other retailers. In addition to its direct retail sales, Overstock.com began offering online auctions on its website in 2004, known as Overstock.com Marketplace and later O.co Marketplace. This service was retired in July 2011. After initially relying solely on word-of-mouth marketing from customers, the company turned to distinctive television advertisements starring German actress Sabine Ehrenfeld. Later, they would employ other advertising spokespersons. In July 2006, John J. Byrne, the father of Overstock's chief executive, resigned from the board of directors after a public airing of the elder Byrne's unhappiness with his son's actions against naked short-selling. In August 2008, Jack Byrne said that after \\"much initial skepticism\\" he believed his son was \\"right all along\\" about the battle and lawsuits with short-sellers and analysts.Jack Byrne legendary in insurance circles , April 8, 2008, The Salt Lake Tribune In 2010 the elder Byrne returned to the Overstock.com board of directors. In early 2007, John A. Fisher and Ray Groves resigned from the Overstock board of directors over disagreement with the company's prime broker suit. On January 2, 2008, Overstock announced that cofounder Jason Lindsey had resigned as president, COO, and as a director of Overstock effective from December 31, 2007. Byrne said Lindsey had \\"played a decisive role getting [Overstock] back on track\\" after \\"I screwed it up a couple years ago\\". Overstock stock dropped to a four-year low following the announcement, which an analyst for investment bank Broadpoint Capital described as a \\"key loss\\". In 2011, revenues dropped 5 percent over a two-month penalty period imposed by Google. According to the Associated Press, Overstock set up fake websites linking back to its own site. Overstock said it was penalized in part for a practice of encouraging college and university websites to post links to Overstock pages so that students and faculty could receive discounts. As a result of the Google penalty, search results for certain products dropped in Google rankings. During the same year, Overstock.com acquired naming rights to the former Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, renaming it Overstock.com Coliseum. The Coliseum was later rebranded O.co Coliseum, in keeping with Overstock's then-rebranding as O.co (in April 2016, the name O.co Coliseum was dropped in favor of Oakland-Alameda Coliseum). In 2013, Overstock began promoting increased immigration. Overstock president Jonathan Johnson told the Los Angeles Times that his firm had struggled to hire enough computer programmers and software developers to expand the business. \\"We pay more, and they are still hard to fill\\", he said. \\"We need to be more free in letting people in. That helps us solve our border problem. No one goes through the window of a house if they can ring the doorbell and come in the front door.\\"Brian Bennett and Lisa Mascaro, \\"Immigration bill would spark surge of legal arrivals\\", L.A. Times, April 13, 2013. http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-legal- immigration-20130414,0,5787920.story In 2014, Overstock began developing software that would allow it to distribute corporate stock online instead of using traditional methods like the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. Byrne took an indefinite leave of absence in April 2016, because of hepatitis C complications. The general counsel, Mitch Edwards, was named acting CEO. In July 2016, Byrne returned as CEO. The company announced a digital dividend with a record date of September 23, 2019. For each 10 shares of traditional stock held, and investor will be entitled to 1 share of Digital Voting Series A-1 Preferred Stock. Initially the digital shares will only be tradable on the PRO Securities alternative trading system, which licenses its technology from tZero, an overstock subsidiary focused on blockchain technology. =Worldstock= In 2001 Overstock set up the Worldstock division, to showcase the work of artisans from around the world.Overstock.com, Press Release, 2002The Worldstock Story By 2006 there were approximately 6,000 producers contributing.Byrne’s War Overstock.com’s Patrick Byrne is On a Self-imposed Mission to Save Main Street from Wall Street , by Colin Kelly Jr., 4.18.2006Overstocking in Afghanistan, by Johanna Glasner, 06.25.04, Wired =Bitcoin= On January 9, 2014, Overstock.com became the first major retailer to start accepting bitcoin as payments for its goods. In the first 22 hours, they received over 800 orders worth US$126,000 in bitcoin. This represents a 4.33% increase in sales from their normal income of $3 million per day. As of March 13, 2014, Overstock bitcoin income had shrunk to under 1% of their normal daily cash intake. In a community interview with social media site Reddit on May 3, 2014, in response to a question to the Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne about the percentage of revenue and transactions paid for in bitcoin, Byrne responded that the percentage was \\"Tiny. <.1%\\". In mid-2014 Overstock.com announced that bitcoin sales were averaging $300,000 per month and that the company expected bitcoin sales to add 4 cents to the company's 2014 earnings per share. Despite at least $175 million in bitcoin or other blockchain investments, the firm never recorded any profits from those investments. = CEO resignation = On August 22, 2019, CEO Patrick Byrne resigned his CEO and board seat at Overstock via a 1600 word email. In the email he admitted to a romantic affair with the Russian Maria Butina but did not provide additional information on how this prompted his resignation. Jonathan Johnson will become the interim CEO. Naked short selling controversy The company has received attention stemming from CEO Patrick Byrne's battle against alleged naked short selling of his company's shares. Beginning in 2005, Byrne has contended that a number of companies, including Overstock.com, have been the targets of this practice, which involves selling a stock short but without the usual step of initially borrowing or locating the shares. Byrne alleges that the practice circumvents safeguards of conventional shorting, and has been used in large schemes devised to profit from driving down the prices of companies' shares, in many cases leading to these companies' failure. With Overstock, Byrne contends that the company's longstanding appearance on the Regulation SHO Threshold Security list, an SEC- mandated list showing companies with a high number of \\"fails to deliver\\", along with high trading volumes that sometimes surpass total quantity of the company's stock, establish that it has been targeted by this practice. Byrne's campaign has been controversial, including criticism in the financial press that Byrne is seeking to divert attention from Overstock's share price declines and failure to turn a profit. New York Times columnist Joseph Nocera has said in 2006 that, \\"Except for a few fellow-traveling Web sites, where Mr. Byrne is viewed as a heroic figure, most people who understand the issue or have looked into it think it's pretty bogus.\\" Others have suggested that the problem is real, but that the SEC acts to prevent it and that it does not happen on any scale such as Byrne suggests. SEC Chairman Christopher Cox called abusive naked short selling \\"a fraud that the commission is bound to prevent and to punish.\\" Overstock filed a lawsuit against the hedge fund Rocker Partners in 2005 for libel, unfair business practices and tortious interference, saying it colluded with a research firm, Gradient Analytics, in short-selling the company while paying Gradient Analytics to publish negative reports about Overstock.com and supplying pre-publication copies to Rocker. Naked short-selling was not alleged in that suit. In a conference call with analysts in August 2005, a day after the suit was filed, Byrne said that \\"there's been a plan since we were in our teens to destroy our stock, drive it down to $6–10 ... and even a plan for how the company would then get whacked up.\\" He said that the conspirators were part of a \\"Miscreants Ball\\", headed by a \\"Sith Lord\\", who he refused to identify but said \\"he's one of the master criminals from the 1980s.\\" Byrne said the conspiracy included hedge funds, journalists, investigators, trial lawyers, the SEC, and Eliot Spitzer.\\"\\"The Phantom Menace\\" Bethany McLean, Fortune Magazine, November 15, 2005 Gradient Analytics countersued, alleging Byrne waged a smear campaign. Rocker Partners, renamed Copper River Management, filed a counterclaim against Overstock in November 2007, alleging overstatement of profits, false projections, and misrepresentations about the company's ventures.\\"Copper River Files Countersuit Vs Overstock, CEO, Directors\\", Carol Remond, Dow Jones News Service, November 10, 2007 Copper River also alleges that Byrne tried to silence critics by suing them. A portion of this suit was settled out of court on October 13, 2008 when Overstock.com and Gradient dropped the claims against each other after Gradient retracted allegations that Overstock's reporting methods did not comply with rules established by the FASB, stated they believed Overstock.com complied with GAAP standards, and that three directors were independent according to NASD standards, and apologized. Byrne has said the apology and settlement \\"represents a great step forward in our case\\", while Copper River's attorney stated that \\"If somehow this improved Overstock's case, then Gradient would admit to doing something wrong and they haven’t\\", and that he expected the settlement to help Copper River's case. On December 8, 2009, it was announced that Copper River had reached an out of court settlement with Overstock. As part of the agreement, Copper River, which closed in December 2008, agreed to pay Overstock $5 million. In a letter to his shareholders, Patrick Byrne said, \\"The good guys won\\". Copper River said in a statement that it continued to deny Overstock's allegations. Copper River managing general partner Marc Cohodes said \\"Although settlement deprives us of the ability to disprove Overstock's case and prosecute our counterclaims, we decided that the litigation costs did not justify passing up a practical way to end four-and-half years of meritless litigation by Overstock.\\" In February 2007, Overstock.com launched a $3.5 billion lawsuit against Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and other large Wall Street firms, alleging a \\"massive illegal stock market manipulation scheme\\" involving naked short selling. Among its allegations, Overstock stated that since at least January 2005, naked short selling has accounted for large portions of Overstock stock, in some cases exceeding the 23.4 million total shares outstanding. The lawsuit alleged that this had created \\"immense downward pressure\\" on share prices over time. Kerry Fields, associate professor of law and business ethics at the University of Southern California, said, \\"Byrne may be able to help set new law if he handles this right.\\" Fields said, Byrne's \\"best approach now is probably to persuade the SEC, which continues to wander around the issue, or the government to serve subpoenas and let them decide whether or not his company was wronged.\\" John Coffee, director of the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia University Law School, described it as overly ambitious and \\"extremely unpromising.\\" Two members of the Overstock.com board of directors, John Fisher and Ray Groves, resigned in disagreement over the lawsuit. In December 2010, all but two of the prime broker defendants settled out of court with Overstock for $4.4 million. That same month, the company filed a motion seeking to amend its lawsuit against the remaining defendants—Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch—to include claims of RICO violations. The enhanced claims were based on evidence gained through discovery in the case. The RICO claim was dismissed at trial, and this was affirmed on appeal. The claim against Goldman was dismissed but Goldman subsequently settled a refiled suit. Merrill finally settled for $20 million in 2016.

Bouts may have studied under Rogier van der Weyden, and his work was influenced by van der Weyden and Jan van Eyck. He worked in Leuven from 1457 (or possibly earlier) until his death in 1475. Bouts was among the first northern painters to demonstrate the use of a single vanishing point (as illustrated in his Last Supper). Works Lamentation, c. 1455-1460 =Early works (before 1464)= Bouts's earliest work is the Triptych of the Virgin's Life in the Prado (Madrid), dated to about 1445. The Deposition Altarpiece in Granada (Capilla Real) probably also dates to this period, around 1450–1460. A dismembered canvas altarpiece—now in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium (Brussels), the J. Paul Getty Museum (Los Angeles), National Gallery (London), Norton Simon Museum (Pasadena), and a Swiss private collection—with the same dimensions as the Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament may belong to this period. The Louvre Lamentation (Pietà) is another early work. =Documented works= Last Supper, 1464–1467 The Last Supper is the central panel of Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament, commissioned from Bouts by the Leuven Confraternity of the Holy Sacrament in 1464. All of the central room's orthogonals (lines imagined to be behind and perpendicular to the picture plane that converge at a vanishing point) lead to a single vanishing point in the centre of the mantelpiece above Christ's head. However the small side room has its own vanishing point, and neither it nor the vanishing point of the main room falls on the horizon of the landscape seen through the windows. The Last Supper is the second dated work (after Petrus Christus' Virgin and Child Enthroned with St. Jerome and St. Francis in Frankfurt, dated 1457) to display an understanding of Italian linear perspective. Scholars also have noted that Bouts's Last Supper was the first Flemish panel painting to depict the Last Supper. In this central panel, Bouts did not focus on the biblical narrative itself but instead presented Christ in the role of a priest performing the consecration of the Eucharistic host from the Catholic Mass. This contrasts strongly with other Last Supper depictions, which often focused on Judas's betrayal or on Christ's comforting of John.Snyder, James. \\"Bouts\\". Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. Retrieved 2 November 2013. Bouts also added to the complexity of this image by including four servants (two in the window and two standing), all dressed in Flemish attire. Although once identified as the artist himself and his two sons, these servants are most likely portraits of the confraternity's members responsible for commissioning the altarpiece. The Last Supper was the central part of the altarpiece in the St. Peter's Church, Leuven. The Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament has four additional panels, two on each side. Because these were taken to the museums in Berlin and Munich in the 19th century, the reconstruction of the original altarpiece has been difficult. Today it is thought that the panel with Abraham and Melchizedek is above the Passover Feast on the left wing, while the Gathering of the Manna is above Elijiah and the Angel on the right wing. All of these are typological precursors to the Last Supper in the central panel. After attaining the rank of city painter of Leuven in 1468, Bouts received a commission to paint two more works for the Town Hall. The first was an altarpiece of the Last Judgment (1468–1470), which exists today only in the two wings with the Road to Paradise and the Fall of the Damned in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lille (France), and a fragmentary Bust of Christ from the central panel in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm. After this, he turned to the larger commission for the Justice Panels (1470–1475), which occupied him until his death in 1475. He completed one panel and began a second, both depicting the life of the 11th-century Holy Roman Emperor Otto III. These pieces can now be seen in the Brussels museum. The remaining two Justice Panels were never completed. =Devotional panels and portraits= Portrait of a Man (Jan van Winckele?) (1462), National Gallery, London The Virgin and Child (c. 1465), National Gallery, London Many of Bouts's authentic works are small devotional panels, usually of the Virgin and Child. An early example is the Davis Madonna in New York (Metropolitan Museum of Art), excellent copies of which exist in the Bargello in Florence and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. This composition follows the formula of the miraculous icon of Notre-Dame-des-Grâces, which was installed in the cathedral of Cambrai (France) in 1454. The Virgin and Child in the National Gallery (London) is the largest and most ambitious of these Marian pictures. In the realm of portraiture, Bouts expanded upon the tradition established by Robert Campin, Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, and Petrus Christus. His dated 1462 Portrait of a Man in the National Gallery (London) is the first instance of a sitter shown in three-quarter view before a discernible background with a glimpse of the landscape out the window. Also widely attributed to Bouts is the Portrait of a Man in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), which resembles some of the figures in the artist's late Justice Panels of 1470–1475. Other portraits associated with Bouts, such as those in Washington (National Gallery of Art) and Antwerp (Royal Museum of Fine Arts), are more problematic. =Other works= The Last Supper and Justice Panels are the only works known to be definitely done by Bouts. The remaining panels from the Last Judgment Altarpiece (datable to 1468–1470) and the triptych The Martyrdom of St Erasmus (before 1466) are also fairly secure attributions. Aside from these, a number of other paintings have been attributed to him. These are: Christ in the House of Simon, Christ in the House of Simon and Nativity fragment with the Virgin at Prayer in the Staatliche Museen. The triptych the Martyrdom of St. Hippolytus (Groeningemuseum), Virgin Enthroned with Four Angels (Capilla Real, Granada), and an Annunciation (Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon). The National Gallery holds 'The Entombment, the Virgin Enthroned with St. Peter and St. Paul, and The Virgin and Child. Others are Saint James the Greater (Museu de Arte Sacra do Funchal, Madeira, Portugal), Ecce Agnus Dei, (Alte Pinakothek), Moses before the Burning Bush (Philadelphia Museum of Art), Bust of Christ (Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen), Virgin and Child (National Gallery of Art, Washington), and a Resurrection in the Norton Simon Museum of Art. Two are in the Louvre – a Nativity fragment with St. Joseph and the Virgin and Child Enthroned in a Niche. Two Boutsian works in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich have perplexed art historians. One is the so- called Pearl of Brabant triptych, which writers as early as 1902 tried to separate from Bouts's authentic works. Recent research seems to refute this attempt. The other is a pair of panels from an altarpiece depicting the Passion—respectively showing the Betrayal of Christ and the Resurrection. For a long time these were considered some of Bouts's earliest works, but dendrochronological evidence now places them around the time of his death in 1475. Schone's 1938 invention of a \\"Master of the Munich Betrayal\\" is a more appropriate attribution. Family Bouts was married twice and had four children. One of his weddings was in Leuven about 1447. His two daughters went to convents, and his two sons became painters who carried the Bouts workshop into the mid-16th century. Little is known of the elder son, Dieric the Younger, although he appears to have continued in his father's style until his early death in 1491. The younger brother, Aelbrecht (or Albert), did likewise, but in a style that is unmistakably his own. His distinctive work propelled Boutsian imagery into the 16th century.

The district operates 26 elementary schools, four middle schools, and four high schools. Founded in 1851, the school district covers Hillsboro, Scholls, Reedville, North Plains, West Union, and other area communities. Total enrollment as of the 2014–2015 school year is 20,884 students, the fourth largest in the state. The district is labeled 1J, as it absorbed the West Union School District, the first district in the county; the J (for \\"joint\\") represents that the district extends into other counties, Yamhill and Multnomah. Hillsboro's elementary schools had been District 7 prior to consolidation in 1996. The high school district was 3J and included students from grades 7 through 12, and received students from the Hillsboro elementary district and five other elementary districts. The Hillsboro School District Board of Directors (school board) consists of seven elected members serving four-year terms. Members receive no pay for their work on the board. The district is part of the Northwest Regional Education Service District.Hillsboro board rethinks, accepts education service district budget. The Oregonian, February 27, 2003. The district also runs a special alternative school and the Hare Field athletic complex. The school district drew criticism for a 12-year contract signed with Coca-Cola to provide soft drinks to the district's schools.Warner, Melanie. Lines Are Drawn for Big Suit Over Sodas. The New York Times, December 7, 2005. History Hillsboro's first school district was formed in 1851 as School District 7. The Reverend Horace Lyman established the district and was the first commissioner, with that title later becoming school superintendent. The first school in the district was a single- room log cabin built in 1853 after a school levy was passed to raise $600 for construction. In 1875, a new frame constructed school was built, with the smaller log cabin was kept for additional space. Map of Hillsboro and school locations as of 2008 In 1890 a new eight-room schoolhouse was finished at the present site of David Hill Elementary. In September 1908, tenth grade was added to the Hillsboro school district, with the classes held on the top floor of the school. Eleventh and twelfth grades were soon added, and in June 1911 the first students to complete four years of high school graduated. This class totaled five students, four girls and one boy. A stand-alone high school was completed by 1913, and a gymnasium was built beginning in 1915. The district overall employed a total of 19 teachers for the 1913–1914 school year. All five of the high school teachers in the district resigned in 1914 in a dispute with management. The school board had allowed the students to vote on which teachers to retain, which the teachers resented even though all were retained in the vote. The mass walkout led to classes being canceled for a time. The district paid high school teachers $133 per month, other teachers $125 per month, and principals $1500 per year for the 1920 to 1921 school year. In 1929, a new high school building was finished with additional buildings and the wings added later. The neighboring Cornelius school district was dissolved in 1960, and part of their enrollment area was shifted to the Hillsboro districts, while the remainder went to the Forest Grove School District. Brookwood Elementary was opened in 1953, followed by Poynter Junior High in 1960, then Brown Junior High and Mooberry Elementary in 1963. In May 1961, voters in all the districts feeding the high school voted on a proposal to merge into a single district. Voters decided not to merge, but the next February voters did approve merging the junior high grades into the high school district. The high school district then purchased Poynter from the elementary district for $772,566, and passed a bond measure in March 1962 to pay for that purchase, expand the school, and pay for the new junior high school that became Brown. The district opened Hare Field in 1965, a multi- sport facility with a track, baseball stadium, and football field.McKinney, Dick. Sparts win first game at Hare.

In 1970, a new senior high school opened on on the south side of Hillsboro, with enrollment of the high school district reaching 3,621 students that year. The Union High School District's teachers held a three-day strike in March 1973 over their contracts, the first teacher's strike in Oregon history. By 1987, enrollment in all the districts feeding into the high school district along with the high school district reached approximately 12,325 students.Ostergren, Jack. Hillsboro hears report on unified school district plan. The Oregonian, September 9, 1987. In 1987, the Union High School District began plans to unify the high school district with the six elementary districts that feed into the district's junior and senior high schools. In 1991, the Oregon Legislature passed a law requiring school districts to unify by 1996, which forced some reluctant elementary districts to unify into the Hillsboro School District.Di Rado, Alicia. Agness stays true to its history. The Oregonian, October 1, 1995. On July 1, 1996, Hillsboro Elementary, North Plains, Farmington View, Groner, Reedville, West Union, and Hillsboro Union High School districts unified into a single district, the fifth largest in Oregon at that time.Franzen, Robin.

In 2006, the district implemented a statistical tracking program that keeps track of all student information such as demographics, attendance, and academic achievement.Navas, Melissa. 'Data warehouse' tracks students. The Oregonian, May 17, 2007. The district faced opposition in 2009 over the demolition of J. B. Thomas Middle School, which preservationists wanted to save for use as a community building. The district planned to tear down the old building after a 2006 bond measure approved construction of several new schools, including a new middle school and expansion at the other existing middle schools. A new elementary school was built with funds from this levy on the eastern part of Thomas' grounds, with the buildings of the old school to be torn down to make way for athletic fields. In July 2009, a court allowed the demolition to go forward. By November 2009 the district had become the first in Oregon to use an Internet-based crisis management program to allow for easier access to information on schools by the district. HSD purchased in the South Hillsboro area in April 2014 to house a fifth high school, and, along with prior acquisitions, could add up to four elementary schools and a middle school in that area.

The old school had previously been in its own school district and the Reedville School District. The 655 students at the school are known as the Wolves. As of 2009, the school had repeatedly missed targets of federal academic guidelines and must either offer free tutoring or transfers to students under the No Child Left Behind Act. At the state level, Witch Hazel scored 77.9 on the state's achievement index and was listed as satisfactory by the state for achievement. =Middle schools= Evergreen The Hillsboro district operates four middle schools housing 7th and 8th grades. Each feeds into a single high school. R. A. Brown Brown In 1963, the Union High School District opened East Hillsboro Junior High School, with Raymond A. \\"Pat\\" Brown as the principal. Brown retired in 1975, and the school was renamed in his honor as Brown Junior High. An expansion in 1980 enlarged the library, gymnasium, and the counseling center. The school became a middle school in 1997. Another expansion about 2007 added eight classrooms along the eastern edge of the school. Located along what is now Cornelius Pass Road, the school is in the Reedville neighborhood between West Baseline and Tualatin Valley Highway. The school houses 7th and 8th grades, and feeds into Century High School. Butternut Creek, Tobias, Imlay, Indian Hills, Ladd Acres, and Reedville elementary schools feed into Brown. As of 2013, the school had 816 students and had a below average performance rating from the state. Evergreen Located on the northwest edge of the city along Evergreen Road, the school houses 7th and 8th grades, and feeds into Glencoe High School. Free Orchards, Jackson, McKinney, Patterson, Lincoln Street, and North Plains elementary schools feed into Evergreen. As of 2013, the school had 794 students and had a below average performance rating from the state. The school opened in 1981 as Evergreen Junior High with Joe Rodriquez as the first principal. It was the fourth junior high in the then Union High School District, and was expanded the next year to house emotionally handicapped students in the district. J. W. Poynter Poynter Opened in 1960 as Poynter Junior High School, the school now feeds into Liberty High School. The school was built by the then elementary school district, then sold the high school district in 1962 for $772,566 after the high school district expanded to include junior high school grades. Poynter is named after James W. Poynter, who had served as the elementary district's superintendent for 19 years and died in 1958. Elementary schools that feed into the school are Mooberry, Eastwood, Orenco, Lenox, Quatama, and West Union. The school is in the central part of Hillsboro on Grant Street, and abuts Cornell Road. As of 2013, the school had 723 students and had a below average performance rating from the state. South Meadows South Meadows Opened in 2009, the school replaced J. B. Thomas Middle School. The $41 million, two-story school has a capacity of 1,000 students, with enrollment at about 750 when it opened. Silver and light brown in color, the building was paid for from a 2006 bond measure, though Hillsboro's Parks Department provided an additional $500,000 to allow for a larger gym that is utilized by the parks department when school is not in session. South Meadows is home to the Hawks and feeds students into Hillsboro High School. The school is located in southeast Hillsboro, adjacent to Witch Hazel Elementary. South Meadows is Hillsboro's only school that has the middle school version of the International Baccalaureate program. As of 2013, the school had 747 students and had a below average performance rating from the state. South Meadows receives students from W.L. Henry, Brookwood, Minter Bridge, Farmington View, Groner, Rosedale, and Witch Hazel elementary schools. =High schools= In order of creation: * Hillsboro High School (colloquially known as Hilhi) (current campus in 1969) * Glencoe High School (1980) * Century High School (1997) * Liberty High School (2003) =Other schools= * City View Charter School, with grades K-8 * Hillsboro Online Academy, grades 7-12 with 110 students as of 2013 * Miller Education Center, alternative school with grades 7-12 =Former schools= Thomas Middle School * Barnes Junior High School: * Peter Boscow Elementary * David Hill Elementary * J.B.

The eastern wing was constructed in 1963. Dual language program In 2002, the district created a Spanish-English dual language immersion program to address the changing needs of the community it serves. As a response to researchhttp://www.ejeacademies.org/ourpages/auto/2010/9/8/48567192/Integrated%20Content%20_%20Language%20Instruction.pdfhttp://ell.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/Conference%20Summary_0.pdf showing that native language instruction increases general literacy, community involvement, and graduation rates, the program was first implemented at the elementary level (at W. L. Henry and Minter Bridge) and now extends K-12 in the Hillsboro High School feeder. The district, which as of 2009-2010 enrolled 16% English-language learners, now offers a dual language diploma endorsement,http://www.pri.org/stories/2014-12-10/enter-school-s-raising-bar- bilingual-ed allowing graduates to demonstrate assessed academic proficiency in both English and Spanish. In neighborhood elementary schools where ELL enrollment is high, early grades are weighted heavily towards the native language. Grade level advancement blends English at an increasing rate in all academic areas (language arts, math, science, etc.), until the overall balance is at approximate parity by middle school.http://www.oregonlive.com/washingtoncounty/index.ssf/2014/09/first_day_at_south_meadows_mid.html Enrollment is optional, meaning the district will accommodate transfer requests away from entirely dual-language neighborhood schools; conversely, families whose neighborhood schools are not part of the program may request in-district transfer to join.

He studied moral philosophy, classical literature, and Hindu philosophy and literature. Professionally, he was known as a prominent critic, journalist, and essayist. Biography A passionate admirer of ancient Greece and its mythology, Lacarrière wrote about it extensively. His essay L'été grec (Greek Summer) was an immense popular success. His classical works Maria of Egypt and Dictionnaire amoureux de la Grèce (Dictionary for one who loves Greece) were also successes. Of interest to ethnographers and ecologists is his Chemin faisant: Mille kilomètres à pied à travers la France (1974, On the way: One thousand kilometers by foot across France). It was based on his walking across France in 1971, when he kept to small roads and byways, stopping at villages. Beginning in August, he traveled from Saverne in the Vosges, reaching Leucate in November, which is located in the Corbières. It was reprinted by Fayard in 1997 with a postscript entitled \\"Memory of roads,\\" and addition of selected letters from readers. It was released again in 2014, again by Fayard. Lacarrière's 1973 literary essay, Les Gnostiques, is well respected for its insights into the early Christian religious movement of Gnosticism. The writer had met English author Lawrence Durrell in 1971, who had been studying some Gnostic texts since the early 1940s. Durrell featured Gnosticism as a plot element in the novels of his The Avignon Quintet (1974 to 1985). He also wrote a \\"Foreword\\" to the 1974 English translation of Lacarrière's essay. He was Correspondent Member of Greek Writers Association “Unifying Process of Authors\\". For the whole of his work, in 1991 Lacarrière was awarded le Grand Prix de l'Académie française (the Great Prize of the French Academy). He died in Paris on 17 September 2005, following complications from orthopedic surgery. His body was cremated and his ashes scattered in Greece, in the waters off the island of Spetses.

There are three main types of celebrity photographs used by magazines and newspapers: event photography, celebrity portraiture, and paparazzi.  TypesEvent photography= Photographers who work Celebrities Photographers related events, such as film premieres, parties and award shows. Event photographers also cover other events such as music festivals, weddings and private functions. Controversy has surrounded event photography. One of the bigger controversies occurred in 2000 at the wedding of Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas. The couple sued Hello! magazine for $800,000 after they printed photos from the couple's wedding. They claimed that Hello! invaded their privacy and damaged their career. In 2003 the court in Douglas v Hello! Ltd ruled in favor of Zeta-Jones and Douglas. Event photographers at red carpet events have been known to sometimes shun certain celebrities. At first, they will boo the celebrity as a warning, and the second time, they will refuse to take pictures of the celebrity. This happens when the photographers are angry at the celebrities actions. For example, if a celebrity decides not to stop for the photographers or doesn't acknowledge them, than that celebrity will be shunned. In recent years stars such as George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez, and Sharon Stone have all been shunned.McKay, Hollie. \\"Red Carpet Photographers Mulling Photo Ban on Charlize Theron; It Wouldn't Be Their First.\\" Fox News.

It is the seat of the Metropolitan City of Florence and a museum. Overview Michelangelo's \\"kneeling windows\\", a feature later copied by the Medici at their Palazzo Pitti, also in Florence The palace was designed by Michelozzo di BartolomeoFabriczy, Michelozzo di Bartolommeo, 38, 41f. for Cosimo de' Medici, head of the Medici banking family, and was built between 1444Aby Warburg,,., \\"Die Baubeginn des Palazzo Medici\\", in Gesamelte Schriften, (Leipzig and Berlin) 1932: v. I, 165. and 1484. It was well known for its stone masonry, which includes architectural elements of rustication and ashlar. The tripartite elevation used here expresses the Renaissance spirit of rationality, order, and classicism on human scale. This tripartite division is emphasized by horizontal stringcourses that divide the building into stories of decreasing height. The transition from the rusticated masonry of the ground floor to the more delicately refined stonework of the third floor makes the building seem lighter and taller as the eye moves upward to the massive cornice that caps and clearly defines the building's outline. Michelozzo was influenced in his design of the palace by both classical Roman and Brunelleschian principles. During the Renaissance revival of classical culture, ancient Roman elements were often replicated in architecture, both built and imagined in paintings. In the Palazzo Medici Riccardi, the rusticated masonry and the cornice had precedents in Roman practice, yet in totality it looks distinctly Florentine, unlike any known Roman building. Similarly, the early Renaissance architect Brunelleschi used Roman techniques and influenced Michelozzo. The open colonnaded court that is at the center of the palazzo plan has roots in the cloisters that developed from Roman peristyles. The once open corner loggia and shop fronts facing the street were walled in during the 16th century. They were replaced by Michelangelo's unusual ground-floor \\"kneeling windows\\" (finestre inginocchiate), with exaggerated scrolling consoles appearing to support the sill and framed in a pedimented aedicule, a motif repeated in his new main doorway. The new windows are set into what appears to be a walled infill of the original arched opening, a Mannerist expression Michelangelo and others used repeatedly.  History  The Palazzo Medici Riccardi was built after the defeat of the Milanese and when Cosimo de Medici had more governmental power. Rinaldo delgi Albizzi had also died giving Cosimo and his supporters even more influence. With this new political power Cosimo decided he wanted to build a palazzo. He was able to acquire property from his neighbors in order to begin the building of the palazzo. Unlike other wealthy families however, Cosimo wanted to start fresh and cleared the site before he began building. Most other families, including those from wealthy backgrounds, built from what was already present. During this time, there was also a concern over sumptuary laws which affected how much wealth one could display or how to display wealth without displaying wealth. Cosimo agreed with this law and believed in this ideal possibly because of his status within the Signoria of Florence. As Pater Patriae, Cosimo was able to find ways around it through building materials and the idea of having the exterior of the building simpler and modest while the inside was more decorated. It was larger than other palazzi but its more modest design made it less noticeable. Yet, Cosimo's attempts at modesty did not help later on when the Medici family was scrutinized for their political power. Accused of spending money that was not his, Cosimo's house became part of arguments claiming that the Medicis built the Palazzo with money that was not theirs. The palace remained the principal residence of the Medici family until the exile of Piero de Medici in 1494. Following their return to power the palace continued to be used by the Medici until 1540 when Cosimo I moved his principal residence to the Palazzo Vecchio. The Palazzo Medici continued to be used as a residence for younger family members until, too austere for Baroque era tastes the palace was sold to the Riccardi family in 1659. The Riccardi renovated the palace and commissioned the magnificent gallery frescoed with the Apotheosis of the Medici by Luca Giordano. The Riccardi family sold the palace to the Tuscan state in 1814 and in 1874 the building became the seat of the provincial government of Florence.https://www.palazzomediciriccardi.it/en/palace/  Architecture  Michelozzo had become a favorite of Cosimo due to his attention to tradition and his style for decoration. Michelozzo had studied under Brunelleschi and some of his work was influenced by the renowned architect and sculptor. However, Brunelleschi had proposed a design to Cosimo but was believed to be too sumptuous and extravagant and was rejected for Michelozzo's more modest design, although Brunelleschi's style can still be seen in the palazzo. The courtyard of the palazzo was based on the loggia of the Ospedale degli Innocenti, a Brunelleschian design. The Palazzo Medici Riccardi was different for its time, and was the start of several architectural breakthroughs. It was believed to be the combination of Michelozzo's traditional and progressive elements that set the tone and style for future palazzi. The palazzo was the first building in the city to be built after the modern order including its own separate rooms and apartments. The palazzo was also a start to not only Michelozzo's climb in status as an architect, but also as \\"the prototype of the Tuscan Renaissance palazzo,\\" and became a repeated style in many of Michelozzo's later work. It was one of the first buildings to have a grand staircase that was not a secular design and for a building of this time and the status symbol of the client at the time, it was a simple and modest- looking building, however it was one of Michelozzo's most important commissions for the family and became a standard for other housing designed by him in years to come. The palazzo itself is based on medieval design with other components added to it. The design was meant to be simpler but set in such a way that it still showed the wealth of the Medici family through use of materials, the interior and the simplicity. The building materials used for the construction were meant to accentuate the structure of the building through the threefold grading of masonry, rusticated blocks on the ground floor, the ashlar face of the top story, and the cornice. The exterior design of the rusticated blocks and ashlar also create an optical recession that makes the building look even larger by the use of rough texture to smoother textures as the building heightens. The cornice in the palazzo was also the first time it debuted fully developed, giving the palazzo more significance in a historical context. The Medici were still able to show their wealth on the exterior through their building material choices. The rusticated blocks soon became seen as a status symbol as the materials were costly and rare. They also, later, became a large part of power politics that was believed to have started with the Palazzo Medici Riccardi. The palazzo is divided into different floors. The ground floor contains two courtyards, chambers, anti- chambers, studies, lavatories, kitchens, wells, secret and public staircases and on each floor there are other rooms meant for family.  Reception  Sforza was himself depicted in the chapel's fresco. Regardless of its purposely plain exterior, the building well reflects the accumulated wealth of the Medici family. The fifteen-year-old Galeazzo Maria Sforza was entertained in Florence on 17 April 1459, and left a letter describing, perhaps in the accomplished terms of a secretary, the all-but-complete palazzo, where his whole entourage was nobly accommodated: Niccolò de' Carissimi, one of Galeazzo Maria's counsellors, furnished further details of the rooms and garden: Furthermore, Cosimo received the young Sforza in a chapel \\"not less ornate and handsome than the rest of the house\\".  Artwork  Gozzoli, the procession of the Magi Seven Saints by Lippi Annunciation by Lippi Perhaps the most important section of the palace is the Magi Chapel, famously frescoed by Benozzo Gozzoli, who completed it around 1459. Gozzoli adorned the frescos with a wealth of anecdotal detail and portraits of members of the Medici family and their allies, along with Byzantine emperor John VIII Palaiologos and Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg parading through Tuscany in the guise of the Three Wise Men.Cristina Acidini discounts this long-held legend in her essay in The Chapel of the Magi. Benozzo Gozzoli's Frescoes in the Palazzo Medici Riccardi Florence (London: Thames & Hudson) 1994. Regardless of its biblical allusions, many of the depictions allude to the Council of Florence (1438-1439), an event that brought prestige to both Florence and the Medici. The chapel also used to host Filippo Lippi's Adoration in the Forest as its altarpiece. Lippi's original is now in Berlin, while a copy by a follower of Lippi has replaced the original. Other decorations of the palazzo included two lunettes by Filippo Lippi, depicting Seven Saints and the Annunciation, both now at the National Gallery, London. Work by Donatello was also displayed in the Palazzo, namely the statues David, displayed in the courtyard, and Judith and Holofernes, displayed in the garden.  Trivia  * When the Medici family returned to Florence after their short exile in the early 15th century, they kept a low profile and exercised their power behind the scenes. This is reflected in the plain exterior of this building, and is said to be the reason why Cosimo de' Medici rejected Brunelleschi's earlier proposal. * The palace was the site of the wedding reception between Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany and Violante Beatrice of Bavaria in 1689. * In 1938 a dinner between heads of state Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler was held in the palace.

The temple is dedicated to Hindu god Shakti in the form of Mangaladevi. The city of Mangalore is named after the presiding deity, Mangaladevi. The temple is of significant antiquity and is believed to have been built during the 9th century by Kundavarman, the most famous king of the Alupa dynasty during the 9th century under the aegies of Matsyendranath. As per another legend, the temple is believed to have been built by Parashurama, one of the ten avatars of Hindu god Vishnu and later expanded by Kundavarman. The temple is built in Kerala style architecture, which is common in all temples in the South Indian state of Kerala and Western Ghats, with most of its structure made of wood. The presiding deity, Mangaladevi in the central shrine is in a seated posture. There are shrines around the sanctum for other deities. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by trustees. The temple is open daily from 6a.m. to 1pm and 4pm to 8:30pm. Etymology Mangalore was named after the Hindu deity Mangaladevi, the presiding deity of the temple According to local legend, a princess from Malabar named Parimala or Premaladevi renounced her kingdom and became a disciple of Matsyendranath, the founder of the Nath tradition. Having converted Premaladevi to the Nath sect, Matsyendranath renamed her Mangaladevi. She arrived in the area with Matsyendranath, but had to settle near Bolar in Mangalore as she fell ill on the way. Eventually she died, and the Mangaladevi temple was consecrated in her honour at Bolar by the local people after her death. The city got its name from the temple. Legend Image of Gomukai, the water spout from the sanctum at Kadri temple The temple dates back to the ninth century when Kundavarman, the most famous king of the Alupa dynasty, was ruling Tulu Nadu. During this period, there were two holy saints of the Nath cult, Machindranath and Gorakhnath, who came from Nepal. They reached Mangalore, crossing the river Nethravathi. The place where they crossed the river came to be known as Gorakdandi. They chose a place near the banks of the Netravathi which was once the centre of activities of the sage Kapila. The ruling king met the two saints. Pleased with the humility and virtues of the king, they informed him that his kingdom needed to be sanctified with a temple for Mangaladevi. From their own mother he heard the story of Vihasini and Andasura, Parashurama and the temple built by them. The two saints took the king to the sites where all these historical events had taken place. They asked the king to dig the place and relieve the lingam and the dharapatra symbolising Mangaladevi and install them in a shrine along with Nagaraja for providing protection. Kundavarman built grand shrine to Mangaladevi was built on the hallowed place with the guidance of the sages. Even today the two temples of Mangaladevi and Kadri, Mangalore have maintained their connection. The hermits of Kadri Yogirajmutt visit Mangaladevi temple on the first days of Kadri temple festival and offer prayer and silk clothes. As per another legend, the temple is believed to have been built by Parashurama, one of the ten avatars of Hindu god Vishnu. During the passage of time, the temple was covered by vegetation and was restored by Kundavarma of Alupa dynasty during the 9th century. There are also views that the temple was built by Ballal family of Attavar to commemorate a Malabar Princess. The Temple The temple is built in Kerala style architecture, which is common in all temples in the South Indian state of Kerala and Western Ghat. The temple has a two storeyed gopura or a gateway tower, with the upper storey having wooden trails covering the Kottupura (a hall of drum beating during festivals). A rectangular wall around the temple, called Kshetra-Madilluka piereced by the gateways, encloses all the shrines of the temple. The metal plated flagpost or Dwajasthamba is located axial to the temple tower leading to the central sanctum. The central shrine called Garbhagudi houses the image of the presiding deity. It is on an elevated platform with a single door reached through a flight of five steps. Either sides of the doors have images of guardian deities called Dvarapalakas. The central shrine has a circular plan with the base built of granite, superstructure built of laterite and conical roof made of terrocata tile supported from inside by a wooden structure. The central shrine is at a lower elevation, with a shrine of Nagar, the snake god, in the elevation. Mangaladevi is depicted in sitting posture as Dharapatra. There is a small Linga to the left of the icon. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by hereditary trustees. The temple is open daily from 6a.m. to 10am, noon to 1pm and 4pm to 8pm. Festivals Chariot of Mangaladevi Navaratri (Dussera) is the time for special pujas performed on all nine days. On the seventh day, Goddess Mangaladevi is worshipped as Chandika (or Marikamaba), on the eighth day the goddess is worshipped as Maha Saraswathi. On the ninth day which is also known as Mahanavami the goddess is worshipped as Vagdevi, goddess for speech, Aayudha puja is performed. All weapons and tools are worshipped, as the day marks the slaying of the cruel demons by the goddess Durga, and Chandika yaaga are also performed on this day. A large number of devotees participate in the Rathothsava on the tenth day, which is celebrated as Dasara. The decorated goddess is mounted on the grand chariot and pulled with thick ropes in a procession that goes to Marnamikatte, where the goddess and the Shami tree (Prosopis cineraria) are worshipped.

(1994) Cavalli-Sforza, L.L., Menozzi, P. & Piazza, A. (1994). The History and Geography of Human Genes. New Jersey: Princeton University Press. Genetic distance is a measure of the genetic divergence between species or between populations within a species, whether the distance measures time from common ancestor or degree of differentiation. Populations with many similar alleles have small genetic distances. This indicates that they are closely related and have a recent common ancestor. Genetic distance is useful for reconstructing the history of populations. For example, evidence from genetic distance suggests that Sub- Saharan African and Eurasian people diverged about 100,000 years ago. Genetic distance is also used for understanding the origin of biodiversity. For example, the genetic distances between different breeds of domesticated animals are often investigated in order to determine which breeds should be protected to maintain genetic diversity. Biological foundation In the genome of an organism, each gene is located at a specific place called the locus for that gene. Allelic variations at these loci cause phenotypic variation within species (e.g. hair colour, eye colour). However, most allele do not have an observable impact on the phenotype. Within a population new alleles generated by mutation either die out or spread throughout the population. When a population is split into different isolated populations (by either geographical or ecological factors), mutations that occur after the split will be present only in the isolated population. Random fluctuation of allele frequencies also produces genetic differentiation between populations. This process is known as genetic drift. By examining the differences between allele frequencies between the populations and computing genetic distance, we can estimate how long ago the two populations were separated. Measures Although it is simple to define genetic distance as a measure of genetic divergence, there are several different statistical measures that have been proposed. This has happened because different authors considered different evolutionary models. The most commonly used are Nei's genetic distance, Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards measure, and Reynolds, Weir and Cockerham's genetic distance, listed below. In all the formulae in this section, X and Y represent two different populations for which L loci have been studied. Let X_{u} represent the uth allele frequency at the lth locus. =Nei's standard genetic distance= In 1972, Masatoshi Nei published what came to be known as Nei's standard genetic distance. This distance has the nice property that if the rate of genetic change (amino acid substitution) is constant per year or generation then Nei's standard genetic distance (D) increases in proportion to divergence time. This measure assumes that genetic differences are caused by mutation and genetic drift. : D=-\\\\ln\\\\frac{\\\\sum\\\\limits_\\\\ell \\\\sum\\\\limits_u X_u Y_u}{\\\\sqrt{ \\\\left(\\\\sum\\\\limits_u X_u^2 \\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\sum\\\\limits_u Y_u^2 \\\\right)}} This distance can also be expressed in terms of the arithmetic mean of gene identity. Let j_X be the probability for the two members of population X having the same allele at a particular locus and j_Y be the corresponding probability in population Y. Also, let j_{XY} be the probability for a member of X and a member of Y having the same allele. Now let J_X, J_Y and J_{XY} represent the arithmetic mean of j_X, j_Y and j_{XY} over all loci, respectively. In other words, : J_X=\\\\sum_u \\\\frac{{X_u}^2}{L} : J_Y=\\\\sum_u \\\\frac{{Y_u}^2}{L} : J_{XY}=\\\\sum_\\\\ell \\\\sum_u \\\\frac{X_uY_u}{L} where L is the total number of loci examined.Nei, M. (1987) Genetic distance and molecular phylogeny. In: Population Genetics and Fishery Management (N. Ryman and F. Utter, eds.), University of Washington Press, Seattle, WA, pp. 193–223. Nei's standard distance can then be written as : D = -\\\\ln \\\\frac{J_{XY}}{\\\\sqrt{J_XJ_Y}} =Cavalli-Sforza chord distance= In 1967 Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza and A. W. F. Edwards published this measure. It assumes that genetic differences arise due to genetic drift only. One major advantage of this measure is that the populations are represented in a hypersphere, the scale of which is one unit per gene substitution. The chord distance in the hyperdimensional sphere is given by : D_\\\\text{CH} = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\sqrt{2\\\\left(1-\\\\sum_\\\\ell \\\\sum_u \\\\sqrt{X_u Y_u}\\\\right)} Some authors drop the factor \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} to simplify the formula at the cost of losing the property that the scale is one unit per gene substitution. =Reynolds, Weir, and Cockerham's genetic distance= In 1983, this measure was published by John Reynolds, Bruce Weir and C. Clark Cockerham. This measure assumes that genetic differentiation occurs only by genetic drift without mutations. It estimates the coancestry coefficient \\\\Theta which provides a measure of the genetic divergence by: : \\\\Theta_w=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\sum\\\\limits_\\\\ell \\\\sum\\\\limits_u (X_u- Y_u)^2}{2\\\\sum\\\\limits_\\\\ell \\\\left(1-\\\\sum\\\\limits_u X_u Y_u\\\\right)}} =Other measures= Many other measures of genetic distance have been proposed with varying success. Nei's DA distance 1983 This distance assumes that genetic differences arise due to mutation and genetic drift, but this distance measure is known to give more reliable population trees than other distances particularly for microsatellite DNA data. : D_A = 1-\\\\sum_\\\\ell \\\\sum_u \\\\sqrt{X_uY_u}/{L} Euclidean distance : D_{EU}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_u (X_u- Y_u)^2} Goldstein distance 1995 It was specifically developed for microsatellite markers and is based on the stepwise-mutation model (SMM). \\\\mu_X and \\\\mu_Y are the means of the allele sizes in population X and Y. : (\\\\delta\\\\mu)^2=\\\\sum_\\\\ell \\\\frac{(\\\\mu_X-\\\\mu_Y)^2}L Nei's minimum genetic distance 1973 This measure assumes that genetic differences arise due to mutation and genetic drift. : D_m=\\\\frac{J_X+J_Y}{2}-J_{XY} Roger's distance 1972 : D_R = \\\\frac{1}{L}\\\\sqrt\\\\frac{\\\\sum\\\\limits_u (X_u-Y_u)^2}{2} Rogers, J. S. (1972). Measures of similarity and genetic distance. In Studies in Genetics VII. pp. 145−153. University of Texas Publication 7213. Austin, Texas. Fixation index A commonly used measure of genetic distance is the fixation index which varies between 0 and 1. A value of 0 indicates that two populations are genetically identical (minimal or no genetic diversity between the two populations) whereas a value of 1 indicates that two populations are genetically different (maximum genetic diversity between the two populations). No mutation is assumed. Large populations between which there is much migration, for example, tend to be little differentiated whereas small populations between which there is little migration tend to be greatly differentiated. Fst is a convenient measure of this differentiation, and as a result Fst and related statistics are among the most widely used descriptive statistics in population and evolutionary genetics. But Fst is more than a descriptive statistic and measure of genetic differentiation. Fst is directly related to the Variance in allele frequency among populations and conversely to the degree of resemblance among individuals within populations. If Fst is small, it means that allele frequencies within each population are very similar; if it is large, it means that allele frequencies are very different.

Retrieved 25 June 2012. History The Wiyot and Yurok are the westernmost people to speak an Algic language. Their languages, Wiyot and Yurok, are distantly related to the Algonquian languages. The Wiyot people's traditional homeland ranged from Mad River (Wiyot name: potawot) through Humboldt Bay (including the present cities of Eureka and Arcata) to the lower Eel River basin. Inland, their territory was heavily forested in ancient redwood. Their stretch of shoreland was mostly sandy, composed of dunes and tidal marsh. They recognized three divisions based on dialect and geography (from north to south): * the Patawat Wiyot, Batawat Wiyot, Mad River Wiyot about Mad River (potawot) * the Wiki Wiyot, Humboldt Bay Wiyot or Wikigadakwi' (\\"poor folks\\") about Humboldt Bay (wiki) * the Wiyat Wiyot or Eel River Wiyot about Eel River delta (wiyat) The Wiyots were among the last natives in California to encounter white settlers. Spanish missions extended only as far north as San Francisco Bay. Following a brief visit in 1806, Russian fur traders, whose 18th-century invasion in search of the sea otter had devastated the Pomo, were uninterested in the area, which was not a sea- otter habitat. The way of life of the Wiyot people, after many centuries of isolated development, was disrupted by the settlement of Europeans. The Josiah Gregg exploring party spent the turn of the years 1849–1850 at Humboldt Bay; subsequent to their return to San Francisco several ships set out to settle the bay. The crew of seafarer Douglass Ottinger became, in 1850, the first Americans to enter Humboldt Bay. White settlement followed swiftly. Fort Humboldt was established on January 30, 1853, by the Army as a buffer between Native Americans, gold-seekers and settlers under the command of Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Robert C. Buchanan of the U.S. 4th Infantry Regiment. Among the miners, farmers, ranchers and loggers pouring into California, many settled at what is now Eureka. Relationships between the Indians and the outsiders became hostile, marked by raids and vigilante justice. =Massacre= Wiyot elders at a vigil memorializing the 1860 Wiyot Massacre On February 26, 1860, the Wiyot experienced a massacre which devastated their numbers and has remained a pervasive part of their cultural heritage and identity. Three days before the massacre, on Washington's birthday, a logging mill engineer from Germany named Robert Gunther bought property on \\"Indian Island\\". The day before the massacre, 25 February, the Weekly Humboldt Times editorialized: \\"The Indians are still killing stock of the settlers in the back country and will continue to do so until they are driven from that section, or exterminated\\"; meanwhile prominent local residents had already formed a vigilante committee to deal with the problem, and were sworn to never reveal their membership. For several days before the massacre, World Renewal ceremonies were being held at the village of Tuluwat, on Indian Island less than a mile offshore from Eureka in Humboldt Bay. Up to 250 Wiyot participated in the ceremonies. The leader of the Humboldt Bay Wiyots was Captain Jim. He organized and led the ceremony to start a new year. A group of white men came to the island in the early morning after the last ceremony was completed and most of the Indian men had left the island, leaving only women and children. The whites were armed with hatchets, clubs and knives and had left their guns behind so the noise of the slaughter would be only screams rather than gunshots. This was not the only massacre that took place that night. Two other village sites were raided, on the Eel River and on the South Spit. Reports of the number of Wiyots killed that night vary from 80 to 200; they were mostly women and children, who were apart from the men conducting ceremonies. There was one survivor of the massacred group on Tutulwat, an infant named Jerry James. Gunther had been asleep on the mainland across Humboldt Bay from the Island and had woken up to what he thought were screams, but went back to sleep. The next morning he was awakened by the Justice of the Peace who went with Gunther to inspect the Island following reports that Indians had been killed. He was appalled by what he saw, recalling \\" …what a sight presented itself to our eyes. Corpses lying all around, and all women and children, but two. Most of them had their skulls split. One old Indian, who looked to be a hundred years old, had his skull split, and still he sat there shivering\\". Gunther initially desired to bring the guilty to justice, but learned \\"We soon found that we had better keep our mouths shut.\\" Three other attacks on Indian settlements took place within two days: at the South Spit (Eureka), at South Fork Eel River (Rohnerville), and at Eagle Prairie (Rio Dell). Gunther said, \\"It was never publicly known who did the killing, yet secretly the parties were pointed out.\\" The 1860 massacre was well documented historically and was reported in San Francisco and New York City by the young American writer Bret Harte. Harte was working as a printer's helper and assistant editor at a local newspaper at the time, and his boss was temporarily absent, leaving Harte in charge of the paper. Harte published a detailed account condemning the event, writing, \\"a more shocking and revolting spectacle never was exhibited to the eyes of a Christian and civilized people. Old women wrinkled and decrepit lay weltering in blood, their brains dashed out and dabbled with their long grey hair. Infants scarcely a span along, with their faces cloven with hatchets and their bodies ghastly with wounds.\\" Major Gabriel J. Rains (sometimes spelled \\"Raines\\"), commander of Fort Humboldt, reported on the massacre to his superiors that \\"Captain Wright's Company [of vigilantes] held a meeting at Eel River and resolved to kill every peaceable Indian – man, woman, and child.\\" The vigilantes were also known as the \\"Humboldt Volunteers, Second Brigade,\\" reported to have organized at Hydesville (the town called \\"Eel River\\" by Major Rains is now named Rohnerville). Gaines reported that around five men had formed a volunteer squad to murder the sleeping women and children on the island. In his army reports, appalled at the massacres and at the openly discussed aims of the local white settlers to kill the Wiyot, he stated there were 55 killed at Indian Island, 40 on South Fork Eel River, and 35 at Eagle Prairie. South Fork Eel River became Rohnerville and was later annexed by Fortuna; Eagle Prairie is now the site of the town of Rio Dell. Meanwhile, The Humboldt Times newspaper editorialized, \\"For the past four years we have advocated two—and only two—alternatives for ridding our country of Indians: either remove them to some reservation or kill them. The loss of life and destruction of property by the Indians for ten years past has not failed to convince every sensitive man that the two races cannot live together, and the recent desperate and bloody demonstrations on Indian Island and elsewhere is proof that the time has arrived that either the pale face or the savage must yield the ground.\\" The Times apparently represented the mainstream opinion in the area at the time. An investigation failed to identify a single perpetrator, although those who did the killing were rumored to be well known. Although a grand jury summoned witnesses and held hearings, no one was indicted. Harte was threatened and in danger of mob violence. He quit his job and left Union in March 1860 by the steamer Columbia for San Francisco, where an anonymous letter published in a city paper is attributed to him, describing widespread community approval of the massacre. The Wiyot people were thus decimated. They were corralled at Fort Humboldt for protection. Survivors were herded mostly to Round Valley, established as an Indian reservation within California, but they kept escaping and returning to their homeland. =Population decline= By 1850, there were about 2000 Wiyot and Karok people living within this area. After 1860, there were an estimated 200 people left. By 1910, there were fewer than 100 full-blood Wiyot people living within their ancestral territory. This rapid decline in population occurred due to disease, slavery, target practice, protection, being herded from place to place (survivors' descendants describe this as \\"death marches\\"), and massacres. Memorials have been held annually at Tuluwat village, on what is now known as Indian Island, since 1992, and a major cultural and environmental restoration project is underway there. More recently, the long-awaited World Renewal Ceremony has returned to the island, and is in the process of being revived by current tribal members. This event is private and central to Wiyot cultural beliefs. =Reservation= In 2000, the Wiyot established the Table Bluff Reservation on of their homeland. The reservation is south of Eureka between Loleta and the South Jetty of Humboldt Bay. Some 350 people are enrolled in the Table Bluff Reservation – Wiyot Tribe. \\"Table Bluff Rancheria of Wiyot Indians of California\\" is the name under which the United States federal government previously listed the Table Bluff Reservation in the Bureau of Indian Affairs list of federally recognized tribes; \\"Table Bluff Reservation- Wiyot Tribe\\" is the current designation. Some people of Wiyot descent are enrolled in the Bear River Rancheria. Since October 2019, the Wiyot have had the land deed to most of Indian Island, which previously was owned by the City of Eureka. Culture and religion The last documented native speaker of Wiyot died in 1962. The Wiyot tribal government is in the process of reviving the language. A central act in the Wiyot people's spirituality is an annual World Renewal Ceremony held at Tuluwat village. Indian Island, formerly called Duluwat Island, was and is the center of the Wiyot world. On the island, at the start of each year, a ceremonial dance called the World Renewal ceremony was held, which lasted seven to ten days. Ceremonial masks were worn during the dance. All people were welcomed; no one was turned away. It was held at the village site of Tuluwat on the northern part of the island. Traditionally the men would leave the island and return the next day with the day's supplies. The elders, women and children were left to rest on the island along with a few men. The people ate mostly clams and acorns, and made long, carved, log canoes. Healers and ceremonial leaders were mostly women, who received their powers on mountaintops during the night. Population Alfred L. Kroeber put the 1770 population of the Wiyot at 1,000. Sherburne F. Cook initially offered an estimate of 1,500 but subsequently raised this to 3,300. Kroeber reported the population of the Wiyot in 1910 as 100. The Wiyot suffered a devastating onslaught of violence by American settlers in the 1850s and 1860s, wiping out the majority of those alive in 1850 and dispossessing them of their lands. Surviving members of the tribe intermarried with neighboring groups, including the Yurok. About 500 Wiyot live in Northern California today, still well below their mid-19th century population of 2,000. Recent events In a step towards making amends, in June 2004 the Eureka City Council transferred of Indian Island back to the Wiyot tribe, to add to the Wiyot had purchased. The council also transferred on the northeast tip of the island on May 18, 2006. Tuluwat, the sacred Wiyot village of Indian Island, is currently being restored by the Wiyot tribe. Eureka businesses have stepped forward to donate supplies and trash barges, and the citizens of Eureka have donated to a Tuluwat restoration fund. In 2013, Wiyot tribe members returned to Indian Island by canoe, and announced plans to hold another World Renewal Ceremony; it will be the first such ceremony to take place on the island since the massacre.

The main European watershed is the drainage divide (\\"watershed\\") which separates the basins of the rivers that empty into the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea and the Baltic Sea from those that feed the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea and the Black Sea. It stretches from the tip of the Iberian Peninsula at Gibraltar in the southwest to the endorheic basin of the Caspian Sea in Russia in the northeast. CourseAtlantic—Mediterranean= Atlantic—Mediterranean watershed marker between Belfort and Mulhouse on the A36 autoroute The Watershed runs northwards through Spain in the Iberian Peninsula towards the Bay of Biscay along the basins of Guadalquivir, Guadiana, Tagus and Douro in the west to the sources of the Ebro in Cantabria. It then follows the main ridge of the Pyrenees eastwards up to Andorra, where it again turns to the north through France along the catchment areas of Garonne (with the summit of the Canal du Midi at Seuil de Naurouze), Loire and Seine in the west and that of the Rhone in the east, marked by the Cévennes mountain range between the sources of the Allier and Ardèche tributaries. At the Belfort Gap south of the Vosges Mountains it separates the Rhone basin in the southwest from the drainage of Meuse and Rhine in the northeast, turns southwards to the Swiss Jura Mountains and passes between Lake Geneva and Lake Neuchâtel. It reaches the Bernese Alps where it crosses the Jungfrau and the Finsteraarhorn, at 4,274 m the high point of the watershed, before dropping to the Grimselpass, rising to the Dammastock before crossing the Furkapass and joining the Alpine divide near the Witenwasserenstock, the triple watershed of the Rhone, Rhine and Po rivers. East of here it crosses the Gotthard Pass and runs along the Adula Alps until it reaches the tripoint of the Rhine, Po and Danube basins at the \\"roof of Europe\\" near Piz Lunghin west of the Maloja Pass. =Atlantic—Black Sea= Trójmorski Wierch - one of six places in Europe where three watersheds meet Rhine–Danube watershed marker near Weitnau, Germany The divide continues northwards along the Albula Alps to Julier Pass, Albula Pass and Flüela Pass south of Davos between the catchment area of the Rhine, which empties into the North Sea via the Netherlands, and the Danube, which flows eastward emptying into the Black Sea. It enters Austria at Piz Buin in the Silvretta Alps running along the Arlberg massif and forming the border between the states of Tyrol and Vorarlberg. It reaches Bavaria, Germany via the crest of the Allgäu Alps and leaves the High Alps at the Adelegg range near Kempten. Within the Alpine foothills it runs north of the Schussen catchment area of Lake Constance towards the sources of the Brigach and Breg headwaters of the Danube in the Black Forest. It then follows the main ridge of the Swabian and Franconian Jura with the crossing of the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal northeastwards up to the Fichtelgebirge and southeastwards along the Bohemian Forest, forming the border between Germany and the Austrian Mühlviertel and Waldviertel regions with the Czech Republic, where the large Bohemian basin is drained by the Elbe River. It again turns northeastwards along the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands-Javořice Highlands to the Śnieżnik Mountains of the Eastern Sudetes at the border with Poland, where the tripoint of Orlice, Elbe (North Sea) and Morava, Danube (Black Sea) and Eastern Neisse, Oder (Baltic Sea) is located at the peak of Trójmorski Wierch (Klepý, Klappersteine, Three seas peak, 1144 m above sea level). The Watershed continues in eastern direction along the Jeseníky Mountains down to Moravian Gate and uphill into the Beskids, with the Oder and Vistula basins in the north, reaching the tripoint of Poland with Slovakia and Ukraine in the Bieszczady Mountains. Then, the Watershed goes northeast near the Poland–Ukraine border, passes through the city of Lviv and, via Volyn, enters Belarus. Then it runs east-northeast along Belarusian Ridge and continues to the Smolensk Oblast of Russia, ending at the tripoint with Caspian drainage basin in the Sychyovsky District, near the midpoint of Western Russia's cities Smolensk and Tver. Characteristics The watershed is not a clearly defined divide. For example, tectonics in the area which is now the Upper Rhine Plain, created the river Rhine. The Rhine's sharper altitude gradient on its much shorter way to the North Sea causes much stronger headward erosion than that of the much older River Danube (see the Danube upper river geology). Therefore the Rhine and its tributaries intrude deeper into phreatic zones of the Swabian Karst and even capture the upper Danube and its surface tributaries.H.

In fact, the National Guard is the only United States military force empowered to function in a state status. Those functions range from limited actions during non-emergency situations to full scale law enforcement of martial law when local law enforcement officials can no longer maintain civil control. The New York National Guard consists of the New York Army National Guard and the New York Air National Guard. The Governor may call individuals or units of the New York National Guard into service during emergencies or to assist in special situations which lend themselves to use of the National Guard. The state mission assigned to the National Guard is: \\"To provide trained and disciplined forces for domestic emergencies or as otherwise provided by state law.\\" The National Guard may be called into federal service in response to a call by the President or Congress. When National Guard troops are called to federal service, the President serves as Commander-in-Chief. The federal mission assigned to the National Guard is: \\"To provide properly trained and equipped units for prompt mobilization for war, National emergency or as otherwise needed.\\" Unlike United States Army Reserve members, National Guard members cannot be mobilized individually (except through voluntary transfers and Temporary Duty Assignments (TDYs), but only as part of their respective units. However, there have been a significant number of individual activations to support military operations after the September 11 terrorist attacks; the legality of this policy is a major issue within the National Guard. New York Guard The state defense force of New York is the New York Guard, a military entity authorized by both the State Code of New York and executive order. The New York Guard is the state's authorized militia and assumes the state mission of the New York National Guard in the event the Guard is mobilized. The New York Guard comprises a large number of retired active and reserve military personnel and selected professionals who volunteer their time and talents in further service to their state. New York Naval Militia The New York Naval Militia is the naval militia of New York, and serves as the naval equivalent of the National Guard. As a federally- recognized naval militia, 95% of members of the naval militia must also be members of the United States Navy Reserve or the United States Marine Corps Reserve.

He was a Jesuit priest and professor of theology, but is remembered mostly for his plays. He had a talent for writing plays that began comically, with loud talk and clowning around, and then turning the tables on his characters, and switching to totally tragic circumstances. At the age of 22 he wrote his first play Cenodoxus, in Latin, a dramatization of the popular Legend of the Doctor of Paris, (the Faust theme). In the play, considered his most notable, a man dies and interrupts his own last rites to announce his own damnation. The play was performed in Augsburg on two consecutive days in July 1602. Another of Bidermann's notable plays is Philemon Martyr, dealing with the persecution of Christians in early Rome. In this play, a musician named Philemon agrees to substitute himself for a Christian friend, take his name, and pretend to render sacrifice to some pagan idols for him, thereby allowing him to avoid – however technically – the Ten Commandments prohibition of doing honor to idols. However, on approaching the altar, Philemon suddenly surprises everyone by saying that he was so adamant in his faith that he would rather die than do homage to an idol. Bidermann also wrote a novel Utopia about a hundred years after Thomas More wrote a story by the same name. His theological works include:Theses Theologicae (1620); Sponsalia (1621); and Poenitentiae Sacramentum (1621). Notable events At the age of eight Bidermann was enrolled in the Jesuit seminary of Augsburg where he devoted himself to his studies. By age 16 he excelled at Latin and Greek. Like the other students there, he studied Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and showed particular promise at writing poetry in Latin. His teachers included the famous grammarian Jacob Pontanus and also Matthaeus Rader, who became a lifelong friend. 1602\\\\. At age 25 he authored a book of epigrams, apparently in chapbook or pamphlet form, which inspired Duke Maximilian I of Bavaria to commission the Jesuits at the Munich Court to fashion a number of pictures to be printed for the masses. Raphael Sadeler, a renowned copper engraver of the time, was commissioned to draw up the plates for use with a printing press. The pictures were titled De Aeternitate Considerationes (Latin for \\"Considerations on Eternity\\"), and bore Bidermann's epigrams at the bottom; they were intended to serve as reminders to the faithful of what is lying in store for those who go to Purgatory, Hell, and Heaven. Many of the prints exist to this day and can be viewed at art museums. When he was in his twenties, he traveled about mostly at the behest of local dukes and barons in Germany, impressed with the play that he wrote at the turn of the century, Cenodoxus. Although he was often found in the company of actors for his play, being seminary students he brought along on a pilgrimage of sorts, he also made it a point to bring religious materials in service of the Counter-Reformation. *Dillingen *Ingolstadt *Augsburg *Lucerne  *1606 Munich *1610 Ebersberg *1615 University of Dillingen In 1617 he wrote the Cosmarchia and in 1619 he wrote the Josaphat. Literary influence Bidermann inspired the 18th century Danish/Norwegian writer Ludvig Holberg to write three plays, Jeppe on the Hill, The Mortgaged Peasant Boy, and The Arabic Powder. He inspired Johann Wolfgang Goethe to put his own spin on the old legend of the Doctor of Paris, Cenodoxus, but, following the Protestant tradition established by Marlowe before him, and familiar with the projected, but yet unfinished (and essentially fragmentary) work of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, called his version of the legend Faust. Religious influence In 1622, at the request of the Pope, Bidermann was sent to Rome to work as a public censor of books, with a duty of enumerating the books that were either worthy of official recommendation, or worthy of condemnation. He served in that post five years, until his death. Suppression of the method of indivisibles On August 10, 1632, the Revisors General of the Jesuits led by Bidermann banned the method of indivisibles of Galileo and Cavalieri from being taught in the vast network of Jesuit schools., p. 17 ReferencesExternal links * Category:1578 births Category:1627 deaths Category:People from Ehingen Category:German Jesuits Category:17th-century Latin-language writers Category:16th-century German Catholic theologians Category:German male non-fiction writers Category:German male dramatists and playwrights Category:17th-century German dramatists and playwrights Category:17th-century German Catholic theologians Category:17th-century German writers Category:17th-century male writers ","title":"Jacob Bidermann"},{"id":"2722723","text":"Choiseul is a Quarter of the Caribbean island nation of Saint Lucia.

It is located on the south side of 21st Street between Hillside and Oliver on the campus of Wichita State University in northeast Wichita. The stadium is home of the Wichita State Shockers baseball team. It has played host to the Shockers in rudimentary form since 1978, and as a complete stadium since 1985. Officially called Eck Stadium, Home of Tyler Field it is sometimes informally referred to as Eck. The stadium, which has gone through numerous upgrades since its original completion, currently seats 7,851. This number does not include the Coleman Outfield Hill which can seat hundreds more. History When Gene Stephenson revived the Shocker baseball program in 1978, the team played most of the season at the city-owned McAdams Field. With six games left in the season, the team moved to its first on-campus facility, Shocker Field. It was a bare-bones facility built on a former golf practice course, with little more than an AstroTurf field, a chain-link fence and a scoreboard. Limited seating was installed in 1979. The first semi-permanent seating was a 322-seat bleacher section installed in 1981. In 1985, building on the momentum from the Shockers advancing all the way to the national championship game in 1982, Wichita State built a permanent 3,044-seat stadium at a cost of $700,000. It was named Eck Stadium after Wichita car dealer Rusty Eck, an early supporter of the baseball program. The stadium's first major renovation came in 1988, with the addition of a new AstroTurf surface, a rubberized warning track and 292 box seats behind the plate. The playing surface was renamed Tyler Field after Ron and Linda Tyler, who funded most of the $425,000 project. A year later, the Shockers won the only team national title by a Shocker team in any sport to date. On Sept. 23, 1999, The Coleman Co. put a $500,000 exclamation point on Wichita State University's Project FutureShox, a $7.8 million effort to make Eck Stadium-Home of Tyler Field the premier collegiate baseball facility in the nation. Plans to significantly upgrade Eck Stadium were first announced on Jan. 28, 1998, and were taken to another level with the leadership of Gene Stephenson, the winningest collegiate baseball coach since 1978. Several major contributors stepped forward on the front end of the project, and on Sept. 23, The Coleman Co. accentuated a project that had Wichita State on its way to having the best collegiate baseball facility in the country. Before the start of the 2020 season, a new facility was constructed adjacent to the Bombardier Learjet Indoor Practice Facility. The new facility features a 2,500 square-foot weight room for both the baseball and softball teams, and a new Wichita State baseball locker room, athletic training room, laundry facility and meeting/video room. The new area also includes coaches offices, a professional-sized dugout for the Shockers, a pedestrian plaza and a new ticket office.  Seating sections  Tyler Field in Eck Stadium (2005) = Virginia H. Farah All-American Club = The Virginia H. Farah All-American Club accommodates nearly 200 fans, and features reserved box seats for up to 96 fans on a veranda level immediately in front of the club. Membership in the Virginia H. Farah All-American Club includes an excellent view of the game from the climate-controlled interior, complimentary food and beverage each game, priority parking and club admission for two fans per membership. = Coleman Hill = The Coleman Hill includes two pavilions and terraces that spruce up the hill. The pavilions feature two covered, split-level, hardwood decks with storage for chairs. One pavilion includes a fireplace. The pavilions provide general seating for groups of fans and may be reserved for special events. Fans in the outfield bleachers at Eck Stadium- Home of Tyler Field are able to enjoy their baseball and picnics in style. The Coleman Co.'s half million-dollar gift to WSU enhances the Shockers' world- class collegiate baseball facilities. The improvements complement the grass seating areas that remain beyond the outfield fence, which include the addition of rock terracing. = Regular seating = The official seating capacity of Eck Stadium is 7,851. This number counts the chairback seats behind home plate, as well as the chairback seats that line the right field line, and the metal grandstands that reside down the right field line as well. Blue \\"box seats\\" are closest to the action behind home plate. Followed by green and yellow seats higher up behind them, they are separated by stairs and a walkway.  Playing surface  Prior to the start of the 2020 season, Major Play artificial turf, a new, state-of-the-art playing surface, was installed by Austin, Texas, based Hellas Construction, the same company that manages artificial surfaces at AT&T; Stadium, home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys, and NRG Stadium, home of the NFL's Houston Texans. In addition a new artificial pitching mound was installed, replacing the old, natural dirt mound, as well as a new outfield wall. The new surface replaced the old AstroTurf surface that had been at Eck Stadium since the 2010 season. Through the 2009 season, the infield consisted of field turf with dirt pockets surrounding each base, the pitchers mound, and home plate. The grass was real and stayed constantly green and long. Eck was known for its long outfield grass as batters struggled to get doubles, with the grass slowing down balls hit in the right or left field gaps. The dimensions are 335 feet down both left and right field lines and 390 to center. Winds often blow from right field to left aiding right- handed batters trying to hit home runs. Both bullpens are located down the foul lines on the respective 1st and 3rd baselines. The third base lines bullpen also contains batting cages WSU uses for practice.

With the New York Guard, the New York Army National Guard and New York Air National Guard, it is under the control of the New York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs and New York's Adjutant General. As of July 2019, the New York Naval Militia has about 2,700 members, more than 95% of whom are also members of the U.S. Naval Reserve, U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, or U.S. Coast Guard Reserve. History The New York Naval Militia was organized as a Provisional Naval Battalion in 1889 and was formally mustered into State service as the First Battalion, Naval Reserve Artillery, on 23 June 1891. One year later the New York Naval Militia was called to active duty to protect steam ship passengers during the 1892 cholera quarantine at Fire Island After the sinking of USS Maine, the New York Naval Militia sent five divisions of its 1st Battalion to fight in the Spanish–American War. New York Naval Militiamen manned two auxiliary cruisers that fought in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, and also conducted patrols of New York Harbor. The New York Naval Militia was activated during both World War I and World War II, as well as the Korean War. In 1996, the New York Naval Militia was called up after the crash of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island. In 1997, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the New York Naval Militia and the United States Coast Guard which allowed Coast Guard reservists to join the New York Naval Militia. This was formalized by a change in New York law in 1998 which also allowed up to five percent of the New York Naval Militia to be qualified volunteers who were not reservists. In 2001, the U.S. state of New York created the New York State Military Emergency Boat Service (MEBS) in an attempt to strengthen homeland security efforts, and a fleet of high-speed, all-aluminum patrol boats was built for this unit. After the September 11 attacks, the New York Naval Militia was called up to aid in recovery efforts. In recent years, the New York Naval Militia has mobilized in response to Hurricanes Irene (2011) and Sandy (2012), the significant Buffalo snowstorm of December 2014, and the Lake Ontario flooding of 2017 and 2019. \\"The New York Naval Militia March\\" is the official march of the New York Naval Militia; it was composed by Major Douglas F. Hedwig of the 89th Army Band, New York Guard. MAJ Hedwig also composed the \\"New York Guard March\\", dedicated to the NY state defense force. The \\"New York Guard March\\" is based on the song \\"The Good Old N.Y.G.\\" composed by MAJ Charles Clanton in 1916. In March 2020, members of the New York Naval Militia were activated to assist in New York's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mission The mission of the New York Naval Militia is to provide a trained and equipped naval force to augment New York National Guard forces during Military Support to Civil Authority operations.DMNA Regulation 10-1 \\"New York Naval Militia Regulations\\" Organization The New York Naval Militia is organized into three regional commands: Southern Command, encompassing Long Island, New York City, Rockland and Westchester Counties; Northern Command, encompassing the Hudson Valley, Catskill and Adirondack Mountains region; and Western Command, encompassing the vast area of the state from Jamestown to the Saint Lawrence River. Educational benefits Since January 1, 1997, a current drilling federal Reservist who is an active member of the New York Naval Militia, in good standing, has been eligible to apply to receive tuition assistance, up to the cost of the State University of New York's (SUNY) maximum in-state undergraduate tuition, at any college, university, or community-technical college in the State of New York recognized and approved by the New York State Board of Regents or State University of New York through the Recruitment Incentive and Retention Program (RIRP). Legal protection Businesses in New York are forbidden from adopting policies that discriminate against members of the New York Naval Militia during the hiring process or after a person has already been hired. Individuals who enforce such policies or in any way discriminate against New York Naval Militia employees in regards to their employment are guilty under New York law of a misdemeanor offense. Employers in the state of New York are required under New York law to grant a leave of absence to employees who are also members of the NYNM whenever these employees are activated to take part in drill, training, or an emergency mission. Employers are then required to reinstate these employees to their previous positions of employment when they return from their deployment. Gallery File:Charles L.

The band became a non-profit organization and changed its name to Columbia Community Band, playing their first concert in May of 1978.  History  The band was formed by Pete DiBona, Bob Thulman and Sue Waller and first rehearsed weekly at Hammond High School as a gathering of musicians who had previously played instruments during their formal schooling and professional musicians looking for another group with which to perform great music. Music teacher Ed Kerman led the band until approximately 1983 and Fred Gruenbaum was the first director. The next director was Ron Friedman, under whom they changed their name to Columbia Concert Band and became incorporated on November 18, 1983. In 1989, Howard County, Maryland music teacher and percussionist Robert Miller took the podium. During this time the band doubled in size, and rehearsed in a number of local schools, before settling at Hammond Middle School where Miller taught. A partnership with Howard Community College was formed. In 2000, Peabody Institute graduate and music teacher Michael Blackman became director. Blackman had been a musician in the group since 1986.

This prevents further progress and sometimes leads to societal collapse. The syndrome appears to have been first described by Walter Von Krämer, in his series of 1989 articlesVon Krämer, W. Fortschrittsfalle Medizin (Medical progress traps), Der Spiegel, 13 March 1989 under the title Fortschrittsfalle Medizin. The specific neologism \\"progress trap\\" was introduced independently in 1990 by Daniel B. O'Leary with his study of the behavioral aspects of this condition: The Progress Trap - Science, Humanity and EnvironmentO'Leary, D. The Progress Trap - Science, Humanity and Environment, Archived presentation, Global Ecopolitics, July 1990. The term later gained attention following the historian and novelist Ronald Wright's 2004 book and Massey Lecture series A Short History of Progress, in which he sketches world history so far as a succession of progress traps. With the documentary film version of Wright's book Surviving Progress, backed by Martin Scorsese, the concept achieved wider recognition. Overview While the idea is not new, Wright identifies the central problem as being one of scale and political will. According to him, the error is often to extrapolate from what appears to work well on a small scale to a larger scale, which depletes natural resources and causes environmental degradation. Large-scale implementation also tends to be subject to diminishing returns. As overpopulation, erosion, greenhouse gas emissions or other consequences become apparent, society is destabilized. In a progress trap, those in positions of authority are unwilling to make changes necessary for future survival. To do so they would need to sacrifice their current status and political power at the top of a hierarchy. They may also be unable to raise public support and the necessary economic resources, even if they try. Deforestation and erosion in ancient Greece may be an example of the latter. A new source of natural resources can provide a reprieve. The European discovery and exploitation of the \\"New World\\" is one example of this, but seems unlikely to be repeated today. Present global civilization has covered the planet to such an extent there are no new resources in sight. Wright concludes that if not averted by some other means, collapse will be on a global scale, if or when it comes. Current economic crises, population problems and global climate change are symptoms that highlight the interdependence of current national economies and ecologies. The problem has deep historical roots, probably dating back to the origins of life on Earth 3.8 billion years ago. In the early Stone Age, improved hunting techniques in vulnerable areas caused the extinction of many prey species, leaving the enlarged populace without an adequate food supply. The only apparent alternative, agriculture, also proved to be a progress trap. Salination, deforestation, erosion and urban sprawl led to disease, malnutrition and so forth, hence shorter lives. Almost any sphere of technology can prove to be a progress trap, as in the example of medicine and its possibly inadequate response to the drawbacks of the high-density agricultural practices (e.g. factory farming) it has enabled. Wright uses weapon technology gradually reaching the threat of total nuclear destruction to illustrate this point. Ultimately, Wright strives to counter at least the Victorian notion of \\"modernity\\" as unconditionally a good thing. Behavioral causes In Escaping the progress trap, O'Leary finds that, besides vested interests and socioeconomic compliance, individual behavior is a significant contributing factor to progress traps, which are not limited to technology. This can be verified in terms of new information from the neurosciences, notably lateralization of brain function, where the short-term goals of a man- made world are increasingly favoured over long-term global interests. His study of this shows how institutions and societies can become committed to an exclusive form of technocratic rationalism. In this scenario, humans diverge from a default interdependence with nature with the result that short-term technical preoccupations slowly inhibit creativity and long-term problem solving, thus compromising long-term interests. Where advances are created by technical specialization and are harmful; such as desertification resulting from mismanaged irrigation; this trend compounds itself and can be irreversible, with collapse resulting. Classic cases would be Sumer and the Indus Valley civilization where output-raising irrigation canals and logging slowly combined to make the fields far too salty to continue supporting the harvests on which the populations relied. Other examples, such as Seymour Cray's overspecialized Control Data Corporation or the Medieval Church's rejection of Roger Bacon's science follow the pattern: The mode of development itself excluded solutions to problems arising from that development. In a contemporary context, unabated oil consumption in a time of climate change is an illustration of the problem; sustainable development is viewed as a solution. According to O'Leary, avoiding the progress trap pattern can be achieved by ensuring, through education and cultural vitality, that individuals and societies do not become preeminently technocratic. Citing research into creativity and resiliency theory, he argues that the intuitive side of the mind/brain must thrive, so that lateral thinking will be an option for seeing and preventing progress traps. Spelling this out in scientific terms may be necessary for policymakers to take notice. Iain McGilchrist's 2009 book The Master and His Emissary, provides neurological insight into behaviors where excessive attention to short-term interests might compromise long-term interests.

Previously, his birth year was also reported as 1890 or 1895. 1891 is generally considered the correct year. was an American jug band and country blues musician, generally known for playing the harmonica. Life and career Lewis was born in Henning, Tennessee, and learned to play the harmonica as a child. He moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in his early teens, where he met Gus Cannon near Ripley in 1910. By that time he was already a respected original stylist on the harmonica, noted for his liquid tone and breath control, which allowed him to generate enormous volume from the instrument. By then he was also noted for his ability to play two harmonicas at once – one with his mouth and one with his nose, a trick he probably taught to Big Walter Horton, who recorded briefly as a teenager with the Memphis Jug Band some 20 years later. Lewis' ability to generate volume led to him playing in string bands and brass marching bands around Henning and on the streets of Memphis. At their meeting in 1907, Lewis introduced Cannon to the 13-year-old guitarist and singer Ashley Thompson, with whom Lewis had been playing in the streets of Ripley and Memphis for some time, and the three of them worked together over the next 20 years whenever Cannon was in Memphis and not away working medicine and tent shows. When Will Shade's Memphis Jugband recorded and became popular in the late 1920s, Cannon added a coal-oil can on a rack round his neck and renamed the trio (Cannon, Lewis and Thompson) Cannon's Jug Stompers. It was this lineup that made the Jug Busters' first recordings, for Victor Records, in Memphis on January 30, 1928. The songs from that session included \\"Minglewood Blues\\", \\"Springdale Blues\\", \\"Big Railroad Blues\\" and \\"Madison Street Rag\\". By the time of the band's next recording, on September 5, 1928, Cannon had replaced Thompson with Elijah Avery on banjo and guitar. By the time of the band's third recording session, four days later, Avery had in turn been replaced with an old friend of Cannon's from the medicine and tent show circuit, the six-string banjo player and guitarist Hosea Woods. The band's lineup remained unchanged from then on. With the Jug Stompers, Lewis sang lead vocal and played a melancholy harmonica solo on \\"Viola Lee Blues\\".Barlow, William (1989). \\"Looking Up at Down\\": The Emergence of Blues Culture. Temple University Press. pp. 214–17. . Lewis recorded four solo tracks and another four sides with the Noah Lewis Jug Band, consisting of Lewis, Sleepy John Estes (guitar) and Yank Rachell (mandolin), in 1930. His songs \\"New, New Minglewood Blues\\", \\"Viola Lee Blues\\", and \\"Big Railroad Blues\\" were in the repertoire of the Grateful Dead.

Units also saw action on both sides of the American Civil War, with many companies of the regiment combined to form the Union Army's 1st West Virginia Infantry.Lineage and honors certificate, 201st Field Artillery Regiment (March 12, 2003). 201st Infantry Regiment On 6 January 1941 the 201st was inducted into federal service at Morgantown, West Virginia, and moved to Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, on 10 January 1941 where it was attached to the Second Army. The regiment staged at Camp Murray, Washington, on 5 August 1941 until it departed the Seattle port of embarkation on 12 September 1941, arriving at Kodiak, Alaska, on 16 September 1941. The 201st transferred to Adak Island in November 1942 and to Amchitka in January 1943 before departing Alaska on 22 March 1944 and returning to the Seattle port of embarkation on 2 April 1944. The regiment moved to Camp Carson, Colorado on 10 April 1944 under the XVI Corps, and was reassigned to the XXXVI Corps on 17 July 1944. Beginning in April 1944, the regiment provided an accelerated six- week course of infantry training (four weeks of familiarization, qualification, and transition firing, and two weeks of tactical training) to men who were formerly members of disbanded anti-aircraft and tank destroyer units or who had volunteered for transfer to the infantry from other branches of the Army.. It relocated to Fort Jackson, South Carolina, on 10 September 1944 under IX Corps and was assigned to XXIII Corps on 25 September 1944. It arrived at Camp Rucker (now Fort Rucker), Alabama, on 3 March 1945 under the Replacement & School Command and was inactivated there on 26 September 1945. Following the war’s end the 201st reverted to state control where it was reorganized and redesignated as the 201st Field Artillery Battalion. Activities In December 1990, the unit was called to serve in Operation Desert Storm. The unit was activated for 180 days unless sooner released or later extended. The 201st left Fairmont and went to Fort Campbell, Kentucky for training. It joined XVIII Corps Artillery, 18th Field Artillery Brigade.Dinackus, Order of Battle: Allied Ground Forces of Operation Desert Storm, 4-26 & 10-2 On the exact 256th anniversary of its founding, the unit fired 256 rounds downrange at Iraqi forces. David Tucker was a chaplain's assistant of the unit at the time and noted this in a letter to The Fairmont Times. The units of the 201st returned to their home base in May, 1991. The unit did not lose a single man during the war. In December 2003, the 201st was again called to active duty for Operation Iraqi Freedom. The soldiers trained at Fort Drum, New York in January and February, 2004 before going overseas. While in theater, the battalion was subordinated to the 197th Fires Brigade of the New Hampshire National Guard and commanded by Colonel James Guise. The 197th reported directly to III Corps Artillery, under the command of Brigadier General Richard Formica. The unit spent one year in Iraq before returning home in February 2005. The Battalion Headquarters (HHB) operated out of Camp Cedar II and Tallil Airbase, both of which are approximately west of An Nasiriyah in the Dhi Qar province of Iraq. B Battery and Service Battery were co-located with the HHB. A Battery operated out of Convoy Support Center (CSC) Scania and C Battery operated out of CSC Navistar in Kuwait. The Battalion's mission was convoy security and route clearance for Main Supply Route (MSR) Tampa, the primary route for supplies in Iraq at the time.

On September 7, 1999, Israeli businessmen Gil S. Sudai and David J. Blumberg patented the methodology, which represented a departure from the approaches employed by other online dating services and dating systems. It focused on matching up people who already had a non- romantic relationship offline, rather than matching up strangers, and was designed to help solve the problems associated with unwanted romantic overtures on the one hand, and inhibition resulting from fears of unrequited love on the other. Several websites have implemented similar anonymous matching systems, including eCRUSH (claiming 350,000 legitimate matches). History DoYouDo, Inc. was incorporated on September 23, 1999, with Sudai serving as chief executive officer and (Spark Networks founder and current CEO) Joe Y. Shapira and (Spark co-founder and former co-chairman) Alon Carmel serving on the board of directors. A 2000 Business Wire article noted: DoYou2.com's failure to catch on widely may have been due to the implementation of the scheme. Its marketing focused on the teen market to the exclusion of the adult market, had a high cheese factor, and concentrated on promoting a viral e-mail system instead of the matching system. The viral e-mail system allowed users to email anonymous DoYOUs through the website, asking, for instance, \\"doYOU Miss me?\\" with the recipient having to guess who sent it. If the recipient guessed incorrectly as to whom sent it, they would send their reply to the wrong person (perhaps one of their friends who hadn’t used the system yet); the recipient of the misdirected reply would in turn try to guess who sent it (or, perhaps, delete the email). The theory behind it was that this would lead to users introducing the system to their friends, expanding the customer base in the same way a virus spreads. This system was shut down in late 2001. The firm was acquired by Matchnet.com in September 2000 for an undisclosed sum, dependent on certain success parameters, to be paid completely in MatchNet shares. The item \\"Acquisition of DoYouDo, Inc. $ − $ 1,820,000\\" appeared on the company's 2001 financial statements. Matchnet's 2002 Annual Report disclosed, \\"The purchase price was contingent upon the Company acquiring a separate entity, eCrush, before May 30, 2001, and was to range from $1,820,000 to $1,820,000 plus 70% of the difference between $5,000,000 and the actual purchase price of eCrush, if it was less than $5,000,000.\\" eCRUSH, a company providing essentially the same service, had entered the market on Valentine's Day, 1999; today eCRUSH claims to have over 1.6 million users and to have legitimately matched over 350,000 people \\"through a proprietary and patented database process.\\" The company never actually acquired eCRUSH.com. MatchNet's 2004 Second Quarter Report claimed that its strategic rationale for the DoYouDo purchase was to \\"leverage the positioning and membership database of an existing online personals service\\" and \\"enhance and extend existing brands.\\" An August 4, 2004, SEC filing said that the rationale was to \\"leverage acquired intellectual property.\\" MatchNet's 2003 annual report noted: \\"Love detector\\" methodology The patent's description notes: Demand for the system is based on the fact that there are many situations in which asking a person out might have negative consequences if the feelings are not mutual. For instance, many people may be reluctant to ask out a good friend, for fear that if the answer is No, it will ruin the friendship once the other person knows how they feel. Co-workers may face a similar situation; if the co-worker rejects the romantic overtures, the work situation may become awkward. In Sudai and Blumberg's \\"Love Detector\\" system described in their patent, users log in and enter a confidential list of friends and acquaintances who they are attracted to. The system periodically searches for pairs who have indicated a mutual attraction and notifies them, so that they can initiate a romantic relationship without fear of rejection. In the event that a person's feelings are unrequited, the object of their affection is never the wiser. As the patent abstract points out, \\"No notification occurs unless the system determines that a match in attraction or interests exists. If a first person's feelings or interests are not mirrored by a second person, the system will not notify either person and only the computer system will be aware of the first person's feelings for the second person.\\" The patent described several variations of the system, including one in which a user can choose to be notified 24 hours later; e.g., to allow time for the man to make the first move. It also provided for different types of attraction, e.g. \\"love,\\" \\"like,\\" and \\"desire.\\" The system could be configured to only match users who shared the same type of attraction.

It operated, almost continuously, from 1996 to 2007. (It was named after the amateur radio callsign of its owner.) The programming was of a less structured nature than traditional talk radio. There was special emphasis on programming for amateur radio operators, satellite TV enthusiasts and the sight impaired. Although not the primary focus of the network, some show hosts did play music--a lot of which was not heard on traditional radio. Comedy and plays--old and new--were also often featured. The format was reminiscent of free-form programming heard during the formative years of FM radio. History *5 April 1996 W0KIE was born on SBS6 Ku-band transponder 13b (12031 MHz) originating via POTS extended fidelity audio feed to the Creek Nation Bingo uplink in Tulsa, Oklahoma. W0KIE uplinked nightly during a 1-hour window (2 bingo games on the video carrier) and a 1/2 hour window (1 bingo game on the video carrier.) *18 June 1996 Houston AMSAT Net joins the W0KIE Network. *Summer 1998 W0KIE uplink moves to Indian bingo uplink in Concho, Oklahoma north of El Reno, Oklahoma. The uplink signal quality would vary at times when the Oklahoma wind rocked the uplink dish. *7 December 1998 W0KIE moves to GE-1 (W1) on the Wisdom Network video carrier, Transponder 12B, 5.7 MHz audio. Uplinking starts around the clock from Bluefield, WV. Audio to uplink using RealAudio encoding via POTS dialup greatly improving audio fidelity. W0KIE retransmitted in FM band spectrum on TCI cable in Tulsa. Satellite air permit obtained from BMI and ASCAP and several Tulsa FM stations. *7 November 2000 W0KIE moves to Satcom C3, Transponder 24, 7.5 MHz audio at a TCI/AT&T; uplink in Denver on the Oxygen Network video carrier. Audio to uplink using a Gentner frequency extender via POTS dialup. W0KIE begins airing a barker advertising feed for the Oxygen Network on 6.8 MHz using a Sony rack mounted mini disc player. *15 October 2001 W0KIE moves to GE7 (now known as AMC7), C-band transponder 5, 7.5 MHz wide audio on the Denver FOX video carrier. *Spring 2004 POTS line digital codec units are obtained, bringing a further improvement in fidelity and reliability over the aging and ailing frequency extender *Spring 2005 The uplink feed is moved to Vyvx (now Level 3) in Denver. Policy at the new location allows internet access via DSL. A computer is installed to carry even higher fidelity audio to the subcarrier. *Summer 2005 Another subcarrier becomes available. W0KIE is now stereo! *8 December 2005 W0KIE moves to Intelsat Americas 6 (IA6, aka T6) 93°W, C-band analog, transponder 1, 6.2 and 6.8 MHz wide band audio on an encrypted adult channel video carrier. IA6 is now known as Galaxy 26. *13 December 2006 W0KIE begins Digicipher feed on AMC 3 (W3) at 87 deg. W. C band, Transponder 7, virtual channel 958 in stereo on a digital ABC - New York and CBS - Erie video carrier. *31 October 2007 at 23:12 CDT The television service on T6 tr 1 ceases—W0KIE's analogue audio channels move to transponder 7 on the same satellite for the month of November 2007. *November 2007 Digicipher feed on AMC 3, is dropped. *1 December 2007 at 10:11 CST The television service on T6 tr 7 ceases—leaving W0KIE Radio absent from satellite. = Demise = In the wake of the decline of C band listeners in general and personal considerations, the owner of W0KIE chose to put the network to rest, and return his callsign to exclusive ham radio use. As of 1 December 2007, W0KIE Satellite Radio Network is off the air, permanently. A contingent of W0KIE programmers went on to form the SkyScanner Satellite Radio Network (named in honour of the late Dean Spratt), buying airtime on Access America (a DVB audio channel, on Galaxy 25 (aka T5) 97.0°W Ku-band). This arrangement was dissolved in January 2012, leaving the group's presence in the hands of Radio Free Dishnuts—an internet-only radio service.

Terminology  Replication in computing can refer to: * Data replication, where the same data is stored on multiple storage devices * Computation replication, where the same computing task is executed many times. Computational tasks may be: ** Replicated in space, where tasks are executed on separate devices ** Replicated in time, where tasks are executed repeatedly on a single device Replication in space or in time is often linked to scheduling algorithms.Mansouri, Najme, Gholam, Hosein Dastghaibyfard, and Ehsan Mansouri. \\"Combination of data replication and scheduling algorithm for improving data availability in Data Grids\\", Journal of Network and Computer Applications (2013) Access to a replicated entity is typically uniform with access to a single non-replicated entity. The replication itself should be transparent to an external user. In a failure scenario, a failover of replicas should be hidden as much as possible with respect to quality of service.V. Andronikou, K. Mamouras, K. Tserpes, D. Kyriazis, T. Varvarigou, \\"Dynamic QoS- aware Data Replication in Grid Environments\\", Elsevier Future Generation Computer Systems - The International Journal of Grid Computing and eScience, 2012 Computer scientists further describe replication as being either: * Active replication, which is performed by processing the same request at every replica * Passive replication, which involves processing every request on a single replica and transferring the result to the other replicas When one leader replica is designated via leader election to process all the requests, the system is using a primary-backup or master-slave scheme, which is predominant in high-availability clusters. In comparison, if any replica can process a request and distribute a new state, the system is using a multi- primary or multi-master scheme. In the latter case, some form of distributed concurrency control must be used, such as a distributed lock manager. Load balancing differs from task replication, since it distributes a load of different computations across machines, and allows a single computation to be dropped in case of failure. Load balancing, however, sometimes uses data replication (especially multi-master replication) internally, to distribute its data among machines. Backup differs from replication in that the saved copy of data remains unchanged for a long period of time. Replicas, on the other hand, undergo frequent updates and quickly lose any historical state. Replication is one of the oldest and most important topics in the overall area of distributed systems. Data replication and computation replication both require processes to handle incoming events. Processes for data replication are passive and operate only to maintain the stored data, reply to read requests and apply updates. Computation replication is usually performed to provide fault-tolerance, and take over an operation if one component fails. In both cases, the underlying needs are to ensure that the replicas see the same events in equivalent orders, so that they stay in consistent states and any replica can respond to queries. = Replication models in distributed systems = Three widely cited models exist for data replication, each having its own properties and performance: * Transactional replication: used for replicating transactional data, such as a database. The one-copy serializability model is employed, which defines valid outcomes of a transaction on replicated data in accordance with the overall ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) properties that transactional systems seek to guarantee. * State machine replication: assumes that the replicated process is a deterministic finite automaton and that atomic broadcast of every event is possible. It is based on distributed consensus and has a great deal in common with the transactional replication model. This is sometimes mistakenly used as a synonym of active replication. State machine replication is usually implemented by a replicated log consisting of multiple subsequent rounds of the Paxos algorithm. This was popularized by Google's Chubby system, and is the core behind the open-source Keyspace data store. * Virtual synchrony: involves a group of processes which cooperate to replicate in-memory data or to coordinate actions. The model defines a distributed entity called a process group. A process can join a group and is provided with a checkpoint containing the current state of the data replicated by group members. Processes can then send multicasts to the group and will see incoming multicasts in the identical order. Membership changes are handled as a special multicast that delivers a new \\"membership view\\" to the processes in the group.  Database replication  Database replication can be used on many database management systems (DBMS), usually with a master-slave relationship between the original and the copies. The master logs the updates, which then ripple through to the slaves. Each slave outputs a message stating that it has received the update successfully, thus allowing the sending of subsequent updates. In multi-master replication, updates can be submitted to any database node, and then ripple through to other servers. This is often desired but introduces substantially increased costs and complexity which may make it impractical in some situations. The most common challenge that exists in multi-master replication is transactional conflict prevention or resolution. Most synchronous (or eager) replication solutions perform conflict prevention, while asynchronous (or lazy) solutions have to perform conflict resolution. For instance, if the same record is changed on two nodes simultaneously, an eager replication system would detect the conflict before confirming the commit and abort one of the transactions. A lazy replication system would allow both transactions to commit and run a conflict resolution during re-synchronization. The resolution of such a conflict may be based on a timestamp of the transaction, on the hierarchy of the origin nodes or on much more complex logic, which decides consistently across all nodes. Database replication becomes more complex when it scales up horizontally and vertically. Horizontal scale-up has more data replicas, while vertical scale-up has data replicas located at greater physical distances. Problems raised by horizontal scale-up can be alleviated by a multi-layer, multi-view access protocol. The early problems of vertical scale-up have largely been addressed by improving Internet reliability and performance. When data is replicated between database servers, so that the information remains consistent throughout the database system and users cannot tell or even know which server in the DBMS they are using, the system is said to exhibit replication transparency.  Disk storage replication  Storage replication Active (real-time) storage replication is usually implemented by distributing updates of a block device to several physical hard disks. This way, any file system supported by the operating system can be replicated without modification, as the file system code works on a level above the block device driver layer. It is implemented either in hardware (in a disk array controller) or in software (in a device driver). The most basic method is disk mirroring, which is typical for locally connected disks. The storage industry narrows the definitions, so mirroring is a local (short-distance) operation. A replication is extendable across a computer network, so that the disks can be located in physically distant locations, and the master-slave database replication model is usually applied. The purpose of replication is to prevent damage from failures or disasters that may occur in one location – or in case such events do occur, to improve the ability to recover data. For replication, latency is the key factor because it determines either how far apart the sites can be or the type of replication that can be employed. The main characteristic of such cross-site replication is how write operations are handled, through either asynchronous or synchronous replication; synchronous replication needs to wait for the destination server's response in any write operation whereas asynchronous replication does not. Synchronous replication guarantees \\"zero data loss\\" by the means of atomic write operations, where the write operation is not considered complete until acknowledged by both the local and remote storage. Most applications wait for a write transaction to complete before proceeding with further work, hence overall performance decreases considerably. Inherently, performance drops proportionally to distance, as minimum latency is dictated by the speed of light. For 10 km distance, the fastest possible roundtrip takes 67 μs, whereas an entire local cached write completes in about 10–20 μs. In Asynchronous replication, the write operation is considered complete as soon as local storage acknowledges it. Remote storage is updated with a small lag. Performance is greatly increased, but in case of a local storage failure, the remote storage is not guaranteed to have the current copy of data (the most recent data may be lost). Semi-synchronous replication typically considers a write operation complete when acknowledged by local storage and received or logged by the remote server. The actual remote write is performed asynchronously, resulting in better performance but remote storage will lag behind the local storage, so that there is no guarantee of durability (i.e., seamless transparency) in the case of local storage failure. Point-in-time replication produces periodic snapshots which are replicated instead of primary storage. This is intended to replicate only the changed data instead of the entire volume. As less information is replicated using this method, replication can occur over less- expensive bandwidth links such as iSCSI or T1 instead of fiberoptic lines. = Implementations = Many distributed filesystems use replication to ensure fault tolerance and avoid a single point of failure. Many commercial synchronous replication systems do not freeze when the remote replica fails or loses connection – behaviour which guarantees zero data loss – but proceed to operate locally, losing the desired zero recovery point objective. Techniques of wide-area network (WAN) optimization can be applied to address the limits imposed by latency.  File-based replication  File-based replication conducts data replication at the logical level (i.e., individual data files) rather than at the storage block level. There are many different ways of performing this, which almost exclusively rely on software. = Capture with a kernel driver = A kernel driver (specifically a filter driver) can be used to intercept calls to the filesystem functions, capturing any activity as it occurs. This uses the same type of technology that real-time active virus checkers employ. At this level, logical file operations are captured like file open, write, delete, etc. The kernel driver transmits these commands to another process, generally over a network to a different machine, which will mimic the operations of the source machine. Like block-level storage replication, the file-level replication allows both synchronous and asynchronous modes. In synchronous mode, write operations on the source machine are held and not allowed to occur until the destination machine has acknowledged the successful replication. Synchronous mode is less common with file replication products although a few solutions exist. File-level replication solutions allow for informed decisions about replication based on the location and type of the file. For example, temporary files or parts of a filesystem that hold no business value could be excluded. The data transmitted can also be more granular; if an application writes 100 bytes, only the 100 bytes are transmitted instead of a complete disk block (generally 4,096 bytes). This substantially reduces the amount of data sent from the source machine and the storage burden on the destination machine. Drawbacks of this software-only solution include the requirement for implementation and maintenance on the operating system level, and an increased burden on the machine's processing power.  File system journal replication  Similarly to database transaction logs, many file systems have the ability to journal their activity. The journal can be sent to another machine, either periodically or in real time by streaming. On the replica side, the journal can be used to play back file system modifications. One of the notable implementations is Microsoft's System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM), released in 2005, which performs periodic updates but does not offer real-time replication. = Batch replication = This is the process of comparing the source and destination file systems and ensuring that the destination matches the source. The key benefit is that such solutions are generally free or inexpensive. The downside is that the process of synchronizing them is quite system-intensive, and consequently this process generally runs infrequently. One of the notable implementations is rsync.  Distributed shared memory replication  Another example of using replication appears in distributed shared memory systems, where many nodes of the system share the same page of memory. This usually means that each node has a separate copy (replica) of this page.  Primary-backup and multi-primary replication  Many classical approaches to replication are based on a primary-backup model where one device or process has unilateral control over one or more other processes or devices. For example, the primary might perform some computation, streaming a log of updates to a backup (standby) process, which can then take over if the primary fails. This approach is common for replicating databases, despite the risk that if a portion of the log is lost during a failure, the backup might not be in a state identical to the primary, and transactions could then be lost. A weakness of primary-backup schemes is that only one is actually performing operations. Fault-tolerance is gained, but the identical backup system doubles the costs. For this reason, starting , the distributed systems research community began to explore alternative methods of replicating data. An outgrowth of this work was the emergence of schemes in which a group of replicas could cooperate, with each process acting as a backup while also handling a share of the workload. Computer scientist Jim Gray analyzed multi- primary replication schemes under the transactional model and published a widely cited paper skeptical of the approach \\"The Dangers of Replication and a Solution\\".\\"The Dangers of Replication and a Solution\\"Proceedings of the 1999 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data: SIGMOD '99, Philadelphia, PA, US; June 1–3, 1999, Volume 28; p. 3. He argued that unless the data splits in some natural way so that the database can be treated as n disjoint sub-databases, concurrency control conflicts will result in seriously degraded performance and the group of replicas will probably slow as a function of n. Gray suggested that the most common approaches are likely to result in degradation that scales as O(n³). His solution, which is to partition the data, is only viable in situations where data actually has a natural partitioning key. In the 1985–1987, the virtual synchrony model was proposed and emerged as a widely adopted standard (it was used in the Isis Toolkit, Horus, Transis, Ensemble, Totem, Spread, C-Ensemble, Phoenix and Quicksilver systems, and is the basis for the CORBA fault-tolerant computing standard). Virtual synchrony permits a multi-primary approach in which a group of processes cooperates to parallelize some aspects of request processing. The scheme can only be used for some forms of in-memory data, but can provide linear speedups in the size of the group. A number of modern products support similar schemes. For example, the Spread Toolkit supports this same virtual synchrony model and can be used to implement a multi-primary replication scheme; it would also be possible to use C-Ensemble or Quicksilver in this manner. WANdisco permits active replication where every node on a network is an exact copy or replica and hence every node on the network is active at one time; this scheme is optimized for use in a wide area network (WAN).

Snatch straps are manufactured from webbing that is capable of approximately 20% stretch under load. This stretching property allows the strap to store kinetic energy, which is used to pull vehicles from a bog. Snatch straps are typically between 6 m (20 ft) and 15 m (50 ft) in length, with 9 m (30 ft) being a common size. Snatch straps also have ratings of permissible working load - e.g. 8,000 kg. A snatch strap is used by attaching one end to a rated recovery point on the bogged vehicle (e.g. a recovery hook or loop on the chassis). A second vehicle is required to do the recovery. The snatch strap is laid out on the ground in the direction the bogged vehicle is to be recovered (either forwards or backwards), with an \\"S\\" bend in the middle approximately 1m in length. The recovery vehicle is backed up so that the snatch strap can be attached to a second rated recovery point on the rear of the recovery vehicle. The recovery vehicle then drives off, and the strap begins to stretch, building up potential energy, until the force keeping the vehicle bogged is overcome, at which point the bogged vehicle is pulled forward (or \\"snatched\\", hence the name).

It consolidated provisions related to offences against the person (an expression, which, in particular, includes offences of violence) from a number of earlier statutes into a single Act. For the most part these provisions were, according to the draftsman of the Act,Greaves. The Criminal Law Consolidation and Amendment Acts 1861 pp. 3–4 incorporated with little or no variation in their phraseology. It is one of a group of Acts sometimes referred to as the Criminal Law Consolidation Acts 1861. It was passed with the object of simplifying the law. It is essentially a revised version of an earlier Consolidation Act, the Offences Against the Person Act 1828 (and the equivalent Irish Act), incorporating subsequent statutes.Davis, James Edward. The Criminal Law Consolidation Statutes of the 24 & 25 of Victoria, Chapters 94 to 100. Butterworths. 1861. Pages vi and vii. Internet Archive. Although it has been substantially amended, it continues to be the foundation for prosecuting personal injury, short of murder, in the courts of England and Wales. The Act was also adopted in British possessions. For example, New Zealand adopted the Act in 1866. In England and Wales and in Northern Ireland, the sexual offences under the Act have all been repealed. For legislation referring to sexual offences, see the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008. In Northern Ireland, the 1861 Act was the basis for a ban on abortion until 2019 when it was amended by the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019. Commentary The Act as originally drafted listed specific methods whereby harm might be caused. For example, section 18 originally included an offence of shooting which could be committed with any of the specified intents. Sections 11 to 15 specified various means by which a person might attempt to commit murder. In some cases, these reflected political issues then of great significance. For example, the Fenians were promoting their political case by leaving barrels of explosives in public places. Hence, sections 28 to 30 and 64 specifically address the problem, whether injury results or not. Similarly, children were throwing stones at passing railway trains, and these provisions remain in force. As originally enacted, the Act had 79 sections. In England and Wales, 37 sections remain in force, namely sections 4, 5, 9, 10, 16 to 18, 20 to 38, 44, 45, 47, 57 to 60, 64, 65, 68 and 78. Of those, only sections 25, 34 to 36 and 78 have not been either partially repealed or otherwise amended. Different subsets of its provisions remain in force in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland. Dangerous offenders See the Criminal Justice Act 2003 for further provisions about sentencing for manslaughter and for offences under sections 4 and 16 to 47 of this Act. HomicideSections 1 to 3 – Murder= Sections 1 to 3 dealt with the death penalty for murder and have been repealed. In the Republic of Ireland, the references to murder in these sections were changed to references to capital murder by section 15 of the Criminal Justice Act 1964. They were repealed by section 9(1) of, and the second schedule to, the Criminal Justice Act 1990.[ But the repeal of section 1 did not affect the operation of sections 64 to 68.(s.9(2)) Section 1 – Penalty for murder This section replaced the corresponding provision in section 3 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828 (9 Geo 4 c 31) and section 4 of the corresponding Irish Act (10 Geo 4 c 34). Section 3 – Disposal of body This section provided that the body of every person executed for murder was to be buried within the precincts of the last prison in which he had been confined, and that his sentence was to direct that this should happen. It replaced the corresponding provision in section 16 of the Anatomy Act 1832 (as amended by section 1 of the next mentioned Act) and replaced section 2 of the Hanging in Chains Act 1834 (4 & 5 Will 4 c 26). =Section 4= The penalty for offences under this section was increased by article 5(1) of the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977,S.I. 1977/1249 (N.I. 16) but not in relation to offences \\"committed before the commencement\\" of that order (art.5(3)). Soliciting to murder This section creates the offence of soliciting to murder. Conspiracy to murder This section creates the offence of conspiracy to murder in the Republic of Ireland. The repeal of as much of this section as related to the offence of conspiracy to murder for England and Wales was consequential on the codification of conspiracy by Part I of the Criminal Law Act 1977. The effect of this section, in relation to conspiracy to commit murder abroad, was preserved by section 1(4) of that Act. The repeal of as much of this section as related to the offence of conspiracy to murder for Northern Ireland was consequential on the codification of conspiracy by Part IV of the Criminal Attempts and Conspiracy (Northern Ireland) Order 1983 (S.I. 1983/1120 (N.I. 13)). =Section 5 – Manslaughter= This section now provides that a person convicted of manslaughter in English law is liable to imprisonment for life or for any shorter term. In England and Wales it now reads: Repeals The words \\"or to pay\\" to the end were repealed by Part I of Tenth Schedule to the Criminal Justice Act 1948. The other words were repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1892. \\"Penal servitude for life\\" This means imprisonment for life: See section 1(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1948 and section 1(2) of the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953 and section 11(2) of the Criminal Law Act 1997. =Other matters= Sections 6 to 8 have been repealed. They respectively dealt with the form of the indictment for murder and manslaughter, with excusable homicide and with petty treason. Section 6 replaced section 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1851 (14 & 15 Vict c 100). This section was repealedThe Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1924, section 16(1) and the second schedule for the Republic of Ireland on 22 August 1924.The Criminal Justice Administration Order, 1924, section (1) Section 7 replaced section 10 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1828. Section 8 replaced section 2 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1828. =Sections 9 and 10: Jurisdiction= Murder or manslaughter abroad. Section 9 gives the courts in England, Wales and Ireland extra-territorial jurisdiction over homicides committed by British subjects overseas. (Note however the restricted definition of \\"subject\\" under section 3 of the British Nationality Act 1948.) Section 10 gives these courts jurisdiction over fatal acts committed by British subjects overseas where the death occurs in England, Wales or Ireland, and jurisdiction over fatal acts committed in England, Wales or Ireland by anyone, including aliens, where the death occurs abroad. (The word \\"criminally\\" in that section has been held to exclude fatal acts done by aliens overseas although the death occurs in England, Wales or Ireland, since such acts are not punishable under the criminal law.) Sections 9 and 10 respectively replace sections 7 and 8 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828. Section 10 was first enacted in 1728/29 by 2 Geo 2 c 21. Attempts to murder Sections 11 to 15 dealt with attempts to murder and have been repealed. See now the Criminal Attempts Act 1981. Section 11 – Administering poison or wounding or causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder This section replaced section 2 of the Offences against the Person Act 1837 (7 Will 4 & 1 Vict c 85). Section 12 – Destroying or damaging a building with gunpowder with intent to murder This section replaced section 2 of the Arson Act 1846 (9 & 10 Vict c 25) (Malicious injuries by fire) Section 13 – Setting fire to or casting away a ship with intent to murder Section 14 – Attempting to administer poison, or shooting or attempting to shoot, or attempting to drown, suffocate or strangle with intent to murder This section replaced section 3 of the Offences against the Person Act 1837. Section 15 – Attempting to commit murder by any other means Threats to kill Section 16 The making of a threat to kill is an offence wherein the defendant intends the victim to fear it will be carried out. It is immaterial whether it is premeditated or said in anger. Although the normal maximum sentence is ten years, offenders deemed to present a \\"significant risk\\" of \\"serious harm\\" to the public can now receive a life sentence under the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Other threats of violence may be prosecuted summarily under section 4 of the Public Order Act 1986. This section, as originally enacted, replaced the offence of sending, delivering or uttering a letter or writing threatening to kill or murder under section 1 of the 10 & 11 Vict c 66 (1847); the other offences under that section being consolidated elsewhere. In Northern Ireland, this section was substituted by article 4 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977 (S.I. 1977/1249 (N.I. 16)). In the Republic of Ireland, this section has been repealed and replaced by section 5 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. Bodily harm In the Republic of Ireland, sections 16 to 26 and 28 to 34 of this Act were repealed by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 Section 17 – Impeding a person endeavouring to save himself or another from shipwreck Shipping was the lifeblood of the Empire, thus, specific offences to protect seamen were common. Wounding and grievous bodily harm The offences under sections 18 and 20 of this Act are discussed in detail in the article grievous bodily harm. =Section 18= This section creates the offences of wounding and causing grievous bodily harm, with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, or to resist arrest. It is punishable with life imprisonment. This section replaces section 4 of the Offences against the Person Act 1837. Charges under this section are, under CPS guidance, reserved for crimes with very high intent which cause serious (potentially life-threatening harm) or showed malicious intent and caused really serious life-threatening or life-altering harm. The former offences under this section of shooting and attempting to shoot with intent have been repealed. It is also no longer possible to charge the remaining offences of wounding and causing grievous bodily harm as having been committed with intent to maim, disfigure or disable as the relevant words have been repealed. =Section 19= This section defined the expression \\"loaded arms\\". The repeal of this section was consequential on the repeal of the offences of shooting and attempting to shoot with intent under sections 14 and 18 above. =Section 20= This section creates the offences of wounding and inflicting grievous bodily harm. The CPS guidance prefers this section to be used instead of section 18 when the harm done was more consequential rather than intentional, and/or the wounding was less serious. These are therefore less serious than the offences created by section 18 and carry a maximum prison sentence of 5 years. This section replaces section 4 of the Prevention of Offences Act 1851 (14 & 15 Vict c 19). The offence of wounding either with or without a weapon or instrument under this section replaces the offence of stabbing, cutting or wounding under that section. =Garrotting, etc. – Administering chloroform, etc.= Sections 21 and 22: Attempting to choke, &c.;, to commit or assist in the committing of any indictable offence. Certain forms of attack have always been viewed with particular horror and the use of strangulation or drugs to render someone unconscious with a view to committing a crime require special treatment. Contemporary crime including date rape following the use of hypnotic drugs such as Flunitrazepam show that little has changed save that where the intended offence is of a sexual nature, separate legislation applies (see Sexual Offences Act 2003). Section 22 replaces section 3 of the Prevention of Offences Act 1851. =Sections 23 and 24: Poisoning= Sections 23 and 24 cover the insidious forms of attack based on administering poisons or other dangerous chemicals and substances intending to injure another. Although rarely used today, the offences remain available should the specific circumstances arise, e.g. sending a package containing a dangerous substance to an embassy. Section 25 permits a jury to find a person charged with an offence under section 23 guilty of an offence under 24. Sections 23 to 25 respectively replace sections 1 to 3 of the 23 & 24 Vict c 8 (1860) (unlawful administering of poison). =Section 26 – Neglecting or causing bodily harm to servants= This section deals with the problem of neglect by an employer who failed to provide adequate food, clothing and accommodation for staff and servants. It is punishable on conviction on indictment with imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. This section replaces section 1 of the Poor Law (Apprentices, &c.;) Act 1851 (14 & 15 Vict c 11). The offence of assault under that section has been replaced by one of doing or causing bodily harm. See also the summary offence under section 6 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875 which could be committed by neglecting to provide medical aid. =Section 27 – Abandoning or exposing a child under the age of two= The offence is in practice obsolete, as it has been superseded by the offence of cruelty to persons under sixteen under section 1 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. The exception to this is that it can be committed by a person who does not have responsibility for the child within the meaning of the 1933 Act (assuming that such a person can unlawfully abandon or expose a child), and also by a person who is under sixteen. =Explosives, etc.= Sections 28, 29, 30, and 64 created a range of criminal offences supplementing the Explosive Substances Act 1883 and the Explosives Act 1875. These remain in force, although the Criminal Damage Act 1971 covers all aspects of the resulting damage to property and the Terrorism Act 2000 deals with possession for terrorist purposes. Section 28 replaces section 3 of the Arson Act 1846 (malicious injuries by fire). Section 29 replaces section 4 of the Arson Act 1846. Section 30 replaces the corresponding offence under section 6 of that Act; the other offences under that section being consolidated elsewhere. =Section 31 – Setting spring guns with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm= This section addresses the problem of those who wish to protect their property with hidden traps. This section replaces sections 1 to 4 of the 7 & 8 Geo 4 c 18 (1827) (An Act to prohibit the setting of spring guns, mantraps and other engines calculated to destroy human life or inflict grievous bodily harm). =Causing danger on railways= Sections 32 to 34 protect the railways from those who place obstructions on the line, throw stones at the passing trains, and generally endanger the passengers. Section 32 replaced the offence of attempting to endanger the safety of passengers under section 6 of the Prevention of Offences Act 1851; the other offence being consolidated elsewhere. Section 33 replaced section 7 of that Act. =Section 35 – Drivers of carriages injuring persons by furious driving= In England and Wales and Northern Ireland this section creates the offence of causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving. It is repealed in the Republic of Ireland. Assaults In 1993, the Law Commission recommended that sections 36 and 37 and 39 and 40 be repealed.The Law Commission. Legislating the Criminal Code: Offences against the Person and General Principles. Law Com 218. Cm 2370. 1993. Para 22.1 and note 245 at page 41. In 1980, the Criminal Law Revision Committee recommended that sections 42 to 45 be repealed.Criminal Law Revision Committee. Fourteenth Report. 1980. Cmnd 7844. ss 163 and 164. =Section 36 – Assaulting or obstructing a clergyman in the execution of his duties= In England and Wales and Northern Ireland, this section reads: Repeals The words omitted at the end were repealed by section 1(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1948 and the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953. This section was repealed in the Republic of Ireland by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. \\"Divine service\\" See Matthews v King [1934] 1 KB 505, 50 TLR 62, 30 Cox 27 \\"Misdemeanor\\" See the Criminal Law Act 1967 and the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967.

Paragraph 3.25 at page 39. =Section 37 – Assault on any person authorised to preserve any shipwrecked vessel or goods= This offence is triable only on indictment and punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years. This section was repealed in the Republic of Ireland by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. =Section 38= The marginal note to this section reads \\"Assault with intent to commit felony, or on peace officers, &c.;\\" It is unreliable.Legislation.gov.uk. Revised annotated copy of section 38. Note X1. (This revision dates to 1 February 1991). This section was repealed for Northern Ireland by section 7(3) of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968 (c.28) (N.I.). The offences of assault with intent to resist arrest and assaulting, etc. a peace officer under this section were replaced by section 7(1) of that Act. Assault with intent to resist arrest In England and Wales, this section creates the offence of assault with intent to resist arrest and provides the penalty to which a person is liable on conviction of that offence on indictment. Assaulting, resisting or wifully obstructing a peace officer in the execution of his duty This offence was repealed and replaced by section 51 of the Police Act 1964. An assault on a constable in the execution of his duty can now be prosecuted summarily under section 89(1) of the Police Act 1996. Assault with intent to commit felony The repeal of this offence was consequential on the abolition of the distinction between felony and misdemeanour. =Section 39 – Assaults with intent to obstruct the sale of grain, or its free passage= Immediately before its repeal, in England and Wales, this section read: Repeals The words \\"and kept to hard labour\\" were repealed for England and Wales by section 1(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1948 and for Northern Ireland by section 1(2) of the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953. This section was repealed as it applied to England and Wales by section 1(1) of, and Group 5 of Part I of Schedule 1 to, the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1989. It has not been replaced. This section was repealed for the Republic of Ireland by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. Derivation This section was derived from the corresponding provision in section 26 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828, and replaced both that provision and section 2 of the 14 & 15 Vict c 92 (which applied to Ireland). The words in square brackets in the text of section 39 above are different from those in section 26 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828.Davis, James Edward.

Pages 11 and 71. =Section 40 – Assaults on seamen, etc= Immediately before its repeal, in England and Wales, this section read: Repeals Words replaced with \\"…\\" were repealed in England and Wales by s. 1(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1948 and in Northern Ireland by the same section of the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953. The section was repealed in the first jurisdiction by section 1(1) (enacting Group 5 of Part I of Schedule 1) to the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1989. It has not been replaced. This section was repealed in the Republic of Ireland by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. Derivation This section lately replaced the essentially identical section 26 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828. This in turn replaced section 2 of the Shipping Offences Act 1793. Appeal The said either party could appeal to one of the superior courts of common law if they were dissatisfied with the determination of the justices as being erroneous in point of law.Davis, James Edward. The Criminal Law Consolidation Statutes of the 24 & 25 of Victoria. Butterworths. 1861. p. 267 Proposals for repeal As to the recommendations of the Criminal Law Revision Committee, Law Commission, and Scottish Law Commission, see the preceding section's summary above. =Section 41 – Assault arising from combination= The repeal of this section was consequential on the decriminalisation of trade unions. See the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1871 and the Trade Union Act 1871. =Section 42 – Common assault and battery= In England and Wales, this section has been repealed and has been replaced by section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. The Criminal Law Act 1977, Schedule 6, increased the maximum fine to £200. (Entries relating to Offences Against the Person Act 1861 repealed by Criminal Justice Act 1988 (c. 33, SIF 39:1), s. 170, Sch. 8 para. 16, Sch. 16). Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 made the offence a summary only offences, and a person guilty of either assault or battery liable to a fine not exceeding level 5 (£5,000) on the standard scale and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both. In Northern Ireland, this section was substituted by section 23(1) of the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953 (c.14) (N.I.). Section 23(2) of that Act provides that any reference to this section in section 46 of the Summary Jurisdiction Act (Northern Ireland) 1953, or in any other enactment, is to be construed as a reference to this section as amended by that Act. This provision is said to be for the removal of doubt. This section was repealed in the Republic of Ireland by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. =Section 43 – Aggravated assault and battery= This section replaces section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1853 (16 & 17 Vict c 30) (aggravated assaults upon women and children) In England and Wales, this section has been repealed and has not been replaced. The Criminal Law Act 1977, Schedule 6, increased the maximum fine to £500. In Northern Ireland, this section makes provision for the summary prosecution of aggravated assaults on women and children. The maximum fine for this offence was increased by section 60(2) of the Summary Jurisdiction and Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1935 (c.13) (N.I.)

This section was repealed in the Republic of Ireland by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. Assault occasioning actual bodily harm In England and Wales, and in Northern Ireland, this section creates the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and provides the penalty to which a person is liable on conviction of that offence on indictment. In the Republic of Ireland this offence has been replaced by the offence of assault causing harm under section 3 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. Common assault In England and Wales, the provision in this section relating to common assault has been repealed. This is an either way offence. In Northern Ireland, it is written that a person who is convicted on indictment (before a Crown Court thus for more serious instances) of common assault is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years. This amounts to a doubling (of the maximum) by article 4(2)(b) of the Criminal Justice (No.2) (Northern Ireland) Order 2004. Rape, abduction and defilement of womenSection 48 – Rape= This section provided that a person guilty of rape was liable to be kept in penal servitude for life or for any term not less than three years or to be imprisoned (with or without hard labour) for any term not exceeding two years. It was a revised version of section 16 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828, incorporating the non-textual amendments made to that section by section 3 of the Substitution of Punishments of Death Act 1841 (4 & 5 Vict c 56) and section 2 of the Penal Servitude Act 1857. It replaced section 16 of the 1828 Act and the corresponding provision in section 3 of the 1841 Act, which were repealed. In England and Wales, this section was repealed and replaced by section 1(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. In Northern Ireland, repeal of this section was consequential upon the codification of the law relating to sexual offences by the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008. =Section 49 – Procuring, by false pretences, false representations or other fraud, a girl under 21 to have illicit carnal connexion with any man= The expression 'illicit carnal connexion' means extramarital sexual intercourse. This section replaced section 1 of the 12 & 13 Vict c 76 (1849) (procuring the defilement of women). This section was repealed and replaced by section 2(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 =Section 50 – Carnal knowledge of girls under 12= Section 50 replaced section 17 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828 and the corresponding provision in section 3 of the Substitution of Punishments of Death Act 1841 (4 & 5 Vict c 56) and incorporated the non-textual amendment made by section 2 of the Penal Servitude Act 1857. Sections 50 and 51 were repealed by section 2 of the Offences against the Person Act 1875. They were replaced by sections 3 and 4 of that Act (also replaced) which had a broader scope. =Section 52 – Indecent assault upon a female= In England and Wales, this section was repealed and replaced by section 14(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. In Northern Ireland, repeal of this section was consequential upon the codification of the law relating to sexual offences. =Section 53 & 54 – Abduction= Sections 53 to 56 were repealed in the Republic of Ireland by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. Sections 53 and 54 created various offences of abduction, including: Forcible abduction of any woman with intent to marry or carnally know her. This would be charged as the common law offences of kidnapping and false imprisonment, or rape, and/or human trafficking under the Sexual Offences Act 2003. In England and Wales, section 53 was repealed and replaced by sections 17 and 18 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. In England and Wales, section 54 was repealed and replaced by section 17(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. In Northern Ireland, repeal of these sections was consequential upon the codification of the law relating to sexual offences. =Section 55 – Abduction of a girl under 16= In England and Wales, this section was repealed and replaced by section 20 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. In Northern Ireland, repeal of this section was consequential upon the codification of the law relating to sexual offences. Child stealing Section 56 created the offence of child stealing. In England and Wales, it has been repealed and replaced by the Child Abduction Act 1984. Bigamy Section 57 – Bigamy This section creates the offence of bigamy. It replaces section 22 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828. Abortion Section 58 - offence of using drugs or instruments to procure abortion, replaced section 6 of the Offences against the Person Act 1837, and provides: :58. Every woman, being with child, who, with intent to procure her own miscarriage, shall unlawfully administer to herself any poison or other noxious thing, or shall unlawfully use any instrument or other means whatsoever with the like intent, and whosoever, with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman whether she be or be not with child, shall unlawfully administer to her or cause to be taken by her any poison or other noxious thing, or unlawfully use any instrument or other means whatsoever with the like intent, shall be guilty of felony, and being convicted thereof shall be liable . . . to be kept in penal servitude for life . . .Revised text of section 58 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. Legislation.gov.uk. Section 59 - offence of supplying or procuring poison or instruments for the purpose of criminal abortion, and provides: :59.

Concealing the birth of a child Section 60 – Concealing the birth of a child This section creates the offence of concealing the birth of a child. It replaces section 14 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828. Sexual activities Section 61 – Buggery This section abolished the nominal (in late generations in non-military, domestic courts always commuted) death penalty for buggery, and provided instead that a person convicted of this was liable to be kept in penal servitude for life or for any term not less than ten years. As contemporary legal commenters noted, the prior sentence of death recorded was a guarantee that death would not actually be inflicted. The new formula provided a clear, direct, by-judge sentencing band. The sentencing band was reduced by section 1 of the Penal Servitude Act 1891 then by section 1 of the Criminal Justice Act 1948. The section replaced section 15 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828. In England and Wales the section was replaced by section 12(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. Section 62 – attempted buggery – assault with intent to commit buggery – indecent assault upon a male In England and Wales this section was replaced by sections 15(1) and 16(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. In Northern Ireland this section as worded was proven to be incompatible with contemporary jurisprudence as to right to freedom from discrimination under the European Convention of Human RightsMcR's Application for Judicial Review (15 January 2002) [2003] NI 1 so was repealed by the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Carnal knowledge Section 63 defined the expression \\"carnal knowledge\\". In England and Wales, this section was repealed and replaced by section 44 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. Other matters Section 64: This section was repealed in the Republic of Ireland by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. Section 65: search warrants for weapons, explosives and other articles intended for use in committing offences. This section was repealed in the Republic of Ireland by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. Sections 66 to 79 dealt with supplemental matters. Section 68 provides that indictable offences under the Act committed within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty are subject to the punishments to which they would be subject if they had been committed in England. If this provision was not redundant in 1861, it is now.Archbold. Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice (2004) Sweet and Maxwell, paragraph 2–76 Section 73: This section was repealed in the Republic of Ireland by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997.

Chang. The Taiping Rebellion : History and Documents, Volume 1: History. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1966. p.91 The uprising was named after the rebel base in Jintian, a town in Guangxi within present-day Guiping. It marked the beginning of the Taiping Rebellion. Background In 1843 Hong Xiuquan, Feng Yunshan and Hong Rengan founded the God Worshipping Society (拜上帝教), a heterodox Christian sect, in Hua County (花縣; present-day Huadu District, Guangdong). The following year they traveled to Guangxi to spread their teachings to the peasant population. After that, Hong Xiuquan returned to Guangdong to write about his beliefs, while Feng Yunshan remained in the Mount Zijing (紫荊山) area to rally people like Yang Xiuqing and Xiao Chaogui to join their sect. Preparations Around 1849, a famine broke out in Guangxi and the Tiandihui (Heaven and Earth Society) rose in rebellion against the ruling Qing Dynasty. In February 1850, a local corps passed through a number of God Worshiping villages and threatened to kill the converts.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 37 (1966) In response, Feng Yunshan began to call for open revolt by the God Worshippers.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 37 (1966) In July 1850, the God Worshipper's leaders directed their followers to converge in Jintian and quickly amassed a force of 10,000-30,000 people.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 39 (1966) In preparation for an uprising, Hong organized these men into military formations, each led by commanders with military ranks: a marshal (軍帥) commanded five divisional marshals (師帥); each divisional marshal commanded five brigade marshals (旅帥); each brigade marshal commanded five infantry chiefs (卒長); each infantry chief commanded four majors (兩司馬); each major commanded five company leaders (伍長); each company leader had four soldiers under him. The total number of officers and enlisted personnel reached 13,155 by the end of that month, and civilian ranks were also created to govern the remaining civilian population. The Qing imperial army in Guangxi was not particularly strong, with only about 30,000 troops, and was occupied with suppressing the Tiandihui's rebellion. Hong Xiuquan and his followers were able to build their forces without being noticed by the government. Opening moves In the 12th lunar month of 1850, Li Dianyuan (李殿元), the Qing army commander at Xunzhou, led his troops to surround one of Hong Xiuquan's residences in Huazhoushanren Village (花洲山人村), Pingnan County (平南縣) in an attempt to eradicate the rebels. However, Hong Xiuquan and Feng Yunshan were saved by reinforcements sent by Yang Xiuqing, and they returned to Jintian. On the 1st day of the 1st lunar month of 1851, an imperial force commanded by Zhou Fengqi (周鳳歧) and his deputies Li Dianyuan and Iktambu (伊克坦布) launched an offensive on Jintian. However, the rebels anticipated the attack and had set up an ambush near Siwang Dyke (思旺圩) and Caijiang Village (蔡江村), five kilometers away from Jintian. The government troops were defeated by the rebels and Iktambu was killed. The uprising On the 11th day of the first lunar month of 1851, which was also Hong Xiuquan's birthday, the God Worshipping Society proclaimed the uprising at Jintian, declaring the formation of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Five rules for its military were stated: *Follow orders *Men and women are to be segregated during movement *Do not commit any mistake *Be fair and harmonious *Cooperate and do not withdraw during battle The rebels changed their garments, kept their hair long (the men previously had to wear their hair in a queue in accordance with Qing law), and tied a red cloth around their heads. On the 13th day, they headed to Dahuangjiangkou (大湟江口). Subsequent clashes As the rebels moved southeastward, Tiandihui rebels totaling more than 2,000 led by Gen. Luo Dagang (羅大綱) and Su Sanniang (蘇三娘) joined Hong Xiuquan. In the meantime, Qing official Li Xingyuan (李星沅) ordered Gen. Xiang Rong to lead 2,000 men to attack the rebels, with an additional support force of 1,000 from Guizhou. On the 18th day of the 2nd lunar month of 1851, Xiang Rong was joined by other imperial armies led by Gen. Li Nengchen (李能臣) and Gen. Zhou Fengqi, and they attacked Dahuangjiangkou simultaneously from east to west. However, they entered minefields set up by the rebels and were ambushed, sustaining several hundred casualties. The government forces were forced to stop their offensive and adopt a siege tactic instead. The rebels withdrew under the cover of darkness on the night of the 10th day of the 3rd lunar month to East Village (東鄉), Wuxuan County. The imperial troops gave chase but were ambushed again. Both sides reached a stalemate near Sanli Dyke (三里圩). On the 23rd day Hong Xiuquan declared himself the \\"Heavenly King\\" (天王) in East Village. On the 3rd day of the 4th lunar month Guangxi governor Zhou Tianjue (周天爵) and Xiang Rong rallied over 6,000 troops to attack East Village but were driven back by the rebels. After suffering continual defeats, Li Xingyuan died on the 12th day of the 5th lunar month. Four days later the rebels broke out of the siege and advanced towards Xiangzhou (象州). Qing forces pursued them while the newly deployed 1,000-strong imperial army from Guangzhou led by Gen. Ulantai (烏蘭泰) was stationed at Liangshan Village (梁山村). Xiang Rong's force was deployed to Jie Ridge (界嶺) to block the rebels' route to the north. At the battle of Du'ao Ridge (獨鰲嶺; located north of Liangshan Village), Wulantai's army was badly mauled by rebel forces. However, as the government troops possessed a geographical advantage, they were able to deflect attempts by the rebels to break out of the encirclement. By the seventh lunar month the rebels were forced to withdraw from Xiangzhou to their original base at Mt. Zijing (紫荊山), Guiping. Although the rebels' northward expedition plan failed to materialize, they did succeed in attracting huge numbers of the lower classes to join them and obtained a large amount of supplies. This marked the beginning of the Taiping Rebellion.

His work is known to have influenced the style of artist Arthur Adams. Career After starting his illustration career in commercial art, Golden entered the comics industry in late 1977, working on such DC Comics titles as Mister Miracle and Batman Family. His first work for Marvel Comics was \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\", a backup story in Marvel Classics Comics #28 (1977) adapting an Edgar Allan Poe short story. In 1978, he collaborated with Bill Mantlo on Marvel's Micronauts which he illustrated for the series' first 12 issues. He drew a number of Marvel series throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including Doctor Strange, the Howard the Duck black-and-white comics magazine, and Marvel Fanfare. Writer Chris Claremont co-created Rogue with Golden in The Avengers Annual #10 (1981).DeFalco, Tom \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 203: \\"[Rogue's] first published appearance occurred in The Avengers Annual #10 by Chris Claremont and Michael Golden.\\" At Continuity Comics, Golden and writer Larry Hama introduced Bucky O'Hare in Echo of Futurepast #1 (May 1984). Back at Marvel, The 'Nam series was launched in 1986 by Doug Murray and Golden.DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 229: \\"[Editor Larry] Hama immediately called Doug Murray, a veteran who had served in Vietnam...Hama also called artist Michael Golden to draw the new title.\\" Golden drew covers for the licensed series G.I.

In the early 1990s, Golden was an editor for DC ComicsNolen- Weathington in Modern Masters Volume 12: Michael Golden p. 44 and later in the decade served as Senior Art Director for Marvel Comics.Nolen-Weathington in Modern Masters Volume 12: Michael Golden p. 52-55 In the 2000s, he drew covers for DC Comics' Nightwing, Superman: The Man of Steel, and Vigilante. Despite his considerable amount of work in comics, Golden has stated that he still finds advertising and commercial design work to be more fulfilling than comics, because \\"it's something different each time.\\" Golden's art style later inspired a number of later comics creators, including Arthur Adams. Golden's work was also appropriated by Glenn Danzig as a logo for his bands Samhain and Danzig. He is managed by Renée Witterstaetter (a former comics colorist, writer, and editor) of Eva Ink Publishing. In a 1997 interview with Wizard magazine, Golden explained that he had not attended a comics convention since 1979, because he is uncomfortable with the cult of personality treatment of comics creators. By the 2000s, however, he had been known to make appearances at conventions.

In the ninth and tenth centuries it covered more than the Northern Isles (Norðreyjar) and included Orkney, Shetland, Caithness, and Sutherland. The ruling position of Jarl or Earl of Orkney was heritable. Orkney and Shetland lie off the northernmost tip of Caithness on the modern day Scottish mainland. The Picts came to Orkney during the Bronze Age, and the archaeological data shows that there were people living there prior to the Vikings, who came to Orkney probably by the latter part of the 8th century, although this is disputed. Norse Vikings probably either came to the islands first as farmers seeking land or as warriors who were claiming territory and riches, or both, as was common with Viking conquests elsewhere. The question of whether the Picts were completely massacred by the settling Vikings, migrated away, or were gradually assimilated, in peaceful coexistence, is a matter of contention.Orkneyjar - Pict and Viking: settlement or slaughter? However, aside from traces of their lives there, their culture did not endure in the early history or character of Orkney. By the 12th century, Orkney was under Norwegian control and by the 13th century, the Orkneyingasaga was written in Iceland, providing one of the earliest and most repeated versions of the history of Norse life on these isles. The Orkneyingasaga is largely fictional however and was not, being written in Iceland, any sort of primary source. Instead, it should be culled for historical details with great care and these data should be matched and compared against data from other sources. Norwegian Jarldom of Orkney Harald Fairhair (Harald Hårfagre), also known as King Harald I of Norway, claimed Orkney and Shetland for his kingdom around 875 and due to political differences and problems had to take military action to secure these Northern isles as realms friendly to his rule at home. Some of his enemies left Orkney for Iceland and perhaps the Faroes. Harald took control of the warrior leaders of Orkney at this point and appointed the jarls, or earls of Orkney, the highest-ranking nobility of the islands, in control of the localized government on his behalf. The martyrdom of Earl Magnus in 1117 resulted in the building of St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall. In 1231, the line of jarls which Harald had established became extinct, and in the same year, the earldom or mormaerdom of Caithness was given over to Magnus, the son of the Mormaer of Angus, forming the basis for a new governing presence. In 1379 Haakon VI Magnusson granted the earldom to Henry Sinclair. In 1468, the Orkney and Shetland were ceded by Christian I of Denmark and Norway against the unpaid dowry of his daughter Margaret, who was betrothed to the Scottish Prince James. Christian I never paid the money owed to James's father, and thus the two island groups became part of the Scottish kingdom. The jarldom, with neither a clear Norse line nor the political support or mechanism for such a line to continue, was given over to Scottish lords. In 1471, James gave lands in Caithness to William Sinclair, Earl of Orkney, in exchange for his lands, and thus Orkney and Shetland became part of the Kingdom of Scotland and William become Earl of Caithness.

In 1567 James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, husband of Mary, Queen of Scots, was created as the Duke of Orkney. When Mary lost her claim to the throne, her husband also lost his to Orkney and the title was considered extinct. Robert Stewart was created as the Earl of Orkney and the title revived but his son, Patrick Stewart forfeited the title. George Hamilton was created as the Earl of Orkney in the third creation of the title in 1696. It is through his family and those families his has married into that the title has survived today. Life under the Scottish earls—especially after the creation of the second line of Earls of Orkney—over time incorporated aspects of Scottish culture while still keeping in place the Norn language, family names and other distinct aspects of Norse influence on the isles. Today, these influences are still found in Orkney and Shetland, making their character somewhat novel and distinct from that of other parts of Scotland.

The length of Nebnuni's reign is mostly lost in a lacuna of the papyrus, except for the end \\"[...] and 22 days\\". The only contemporary attestation of Nebnuni is a faience stele showing the king before Ptah \\"South of his wall\\", a memphite epithet of the god, and on the other before Horus, \\"Lord of the foreign countries\\". The stele is also inscribed with Nebnuni's nomen and prenomen. The stele was discovered at Gebel el-Zeit on the Red Sea coast in the Sinai, where mines of galena were located.Georges Castel and Georges Soukiassian: Dépôt de stèles dans le sanctuaire du Nouvel Empire au Gebel Zeit, BIFAO 85 (1985), ISSN 0255-0962, p. 290, pl. 62 Reign The Egyptologist Kim Ryholt credits Nebnuni with a reign of two years, from 1785 BC until 1783 BC. Alternatively, Egyptologists Rolf Krauss, Detlef Franke and Thomas Schneider give Nebuni only one year of reign in 1739 BC.Thomas Schneider following Detlef Franke: Lexikon der Pharaonen, Albatros, Düsseldorf 2002, Although little is known of Nebnuni's reign, the existence of his stele shows that during this period, rulers of the 13th Dynasty still wielded sufficient power to organize mining expeditions in the Sinai for the supply of construction materials and the production of luxury items. Finally, Ryholt points to the lack of royal connections between Nebnuni and his predecessor. He thus concludes that Nebnuni may have usurped the throne.

Geography  Herzberg is situated on the southwestern rim of the Harz mountain range and the Harz National Park. Natural monuments in the surrounding area include the Unicorn Cave, the Karst Trail, and the Rhume Spring. The town centre is located on the Sieber river, about northeast of Göttingen and southeast of the state capital Hanover. The municipal area comprises the villages of Lonau, Pöhlde, Scharzfeld, and Sieber.  History  Herzberg Castle Herzberg Castle in the Duchy of Saxony was first mentioned in an 1143 deed. A hunting lodge at the site was already erected from 1024 to 1029 by King Lothair II. It was seized by the Saxon Welf dynasty in 1144 and in 1158 became a property of Duke Henry the Lion with consent of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa. The castle was part of the Grubenhagen estates of the Welf duke Henry I of Brunswick he received in 1291, when he and his brothers divided their heritage. A settlement below the castle was first documented in 1337. The Brunswick rulers of the Grubenhagen principality resided here from 1486 until the line became extinct in 1596. In 1617 Duke George of Brunswick-Lüneburg had his inheritance rights confirmed by Emperor Matthias and again lived at the castle with his wife Anne Eleonore of Hesse-Darmstadt until in 1636 he moved his residence to the Leineschloss in Hanover. Herzberg first developed as a centre of cloth and linen manufacturing. In the 18th and 19th century important industries included brewing, the founding and turning of metal, agricultural machinery and boot making as well as arms production for the Hanover forces. Herzberg received town privileges in 1929, when it was part of the Prussian Province of Hanover. Herzberg is the location of a club that promotes the international auxiliary language Esperanto, the Interkultura Centro Herzberg (Esperanto for \\"Intercultural Center of Herzberg\\").

The film focuses on a young girl in a finishing school who is plagued by nightmares concerning her institutionalized mother. Plot Janet (Elizabeth Dear & Jennie Linden), a girl at finishing school who six years earlier saw her mother (Isla Cameron) stab her father to death, is plagued by nightmares. (Her mother, following the tragedy, was committed to an asylum.) Miss Lewis (Brenda Bruce), a teacher, takes Janet home and in the absence of Henry Baxter (David Knight), Janet's guardian, they are met by John (George A. Cooper), the chauffeur; Mrs. Gibbs (Irene Richmond), the housekeeper; and Grace Maddox (Moira Redmond), an attractive nurse-companion hired by Henry. Miss Lewis leaves Janet in Grace's care. The nightmares continue: a white-shrouded woman (Clytie Jessop) roams the corridors, inviting Janet to burst into her parents' room, where she finds the same woman on the bed with a knife in her chest. When Henry returns, he finds Janet under sedation; her doctors recommend psychiatric care but he refuses and Janet tries to commit suicide. Henry's wife comes to tea and, because she seems to be the woman in Janet's nightmares, Janet stabs the woman to death and is promptly committed to an institution. The woman in white is revealed to be Grace, disguised with a wig and mask and in cahoots with Henry. They marry, but Grace begins believing that Henry is trying to drive her mad. Under the impression that Janet has escaped from the asylum, Grace stabs Henry to death, expecting Janet to be blamed. Janet, however, never left the asylum and Grace is brought to justice.

It is located in Sitka Sound, just south of Kruzof Island, and within the limits of the City and Borough of Sitka, Alaska. The island's name is Kanasx'ée in the Tlingit language. Island geography St. Lazaria is a very rugged looking island with limited and difficult access. Its direct exposure to the Pacific Ocean makes it ideal for birds to inhabit. Most likely the island is a volcanic plug -- the remnants of an old and eroded volcano -- which would make St. Lazaria an older volcanic cousin to the adjacent Mount Edgecumbe on Kruzof Island. The island itself is low with broken terrain due to its volcanic origins. Its highest point is above sea level and there are two small summits on the island with a low, treeless saddle connecting the two that can often be overcome by waves during storms and at high tide. There are many cliffs that can get up to tall and shoot strait into the ocean as well as sea-level caves that can be explored on a calm day by thrill-seeking individuals in small craft. Refuge history St. Lazaria Island is just one of the 2,500 islands throughout Alaska that comprise the Alaska Maritime Wildlife Refuge. It was originally designated as a \\"refuge for seabirds\\" in 1909, but received official wilderness designation from congress in 1970. It was added to the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge in 1980. Flora and fauna Just about all the wildlife on St. Lazaria is birds. On the island there are: *250,000 breeding pairs of fork-tailed storm-petrels and Leach's storm- petrels. *4-5,000 common and thick-billed murres. *1,500-2,000 breeding pairs of tufted puffins. *1,000 breeding pairs of rhinoceros auklets. Other less populous species include: pigeon guillemots, glaucous-winged gulls, ancient murrelets, Cassin's auklets, bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and black oystercatchers. In nesting areas on the island, the bird density can reach 7000 birds per acre. The only trees on the island are Sitka Spruce which are located at the highest points of elevation. Visiting It is a popular day boat-trip for Sitkans or a place to cruise around for fishermen already in the area. St. Lazaria is not supposed to be visited by foot from anyone other than permitted scientists as every square foot of ground contains burrows for nesting birds and can be easily crushed, disturbed, or destroyed. However, over 2,000 people a year visit the island by boat circling around the volcanic hulk -- admiring its birds, cliffs, caves, and other volcanic landforms. Small and large-scale tour operators alike make St. Lazaria a popular and well-known tourist destination in Sitka.

She is the author of eight books. Biography Macy graduated from Wellesley College in 1950 and received her Ph.D in Religious Studies in 1978 from Syracuse University, Syracuse. She studied there with Huston Smith, the influential author of The World's Religions (previously entitled The Religions of Man). She is an international spokesperson for anti-nuclear causes, peace, justice, and environmentalism, most renowned for her book Coming Back to Life: Practices to Reconnect Our Lives, Our World and the Great Turning initiative, which deals with the transformation from, as she terms it, an industrial growth society to what she considers to be a more sustainable civilization. She has created a theoretical framework for personal and social change, and a workshop methodology for its application. Her work addresses psychological and spiritual issues, Buddhist thought, and contemporary science. She was married to the late Francis Underhill Macy, the activist and Russian scholar who founded the Center for Safe Energy. Key influences Macy first encountered Buddhism in 1965 while working with Tibetan refugees in northern India, particularly the Ven. 8th Khamtrul Rinpoche, Sister Karma Khechog Palmo, Ven. Dugu Choegyal Rinpoche, and Tokden Antrim of the Tashi Jong community. Her spiritual practice is drawn from the Theravada tradition of Nyanaponika Thera and Rev. Sivali of Sri Lanka, Munindraji of West Bengal, and Dhiravamsa of Thailand. Key formative influences to her teaching in the field of the connection to living systems theory have been Ervin Laszlo who introduced her to systems theory through his writings (especially Introduction to Systems Philosophy and Systems, Structure and Experience), and who worked with her as advisor on her doctoral dissertation (later adapted as Mutual Causality) and on a project for the Club of Rome. Gregory Bateson, through his Steps to an Ecology of Mind and in a summer seminar, also shaped her thought, as did the writings of Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Arthur Koestler, and Hazel Henderson. She was influenced in the studies of biological systems by Tyrone Cashman, and economic systems by Kenneth Boulding. Donella Meadows provided insights on the planetary consequences of runaway systems, and Elisabet Sahtouris provided further information about self-organizing systems in evolutionary perspective. Work Macy travels giving lectures, workshops, and trainings internationally. Her work, originally called \\"Despair and Empowerment Work\\" was acknowledged as being part of the deep ecology tradition after she encountered the work of Arne Naess and John Seed , but as a result of disillusion with academic disputes in the field, she now calls it \\"the Work that Reconnects\\". Widowed by the death of her husband, Francis Underhill Macy, in January 2009, she lives in Berkeley, California, near her children and grandchildren. She serves as adjunct professor to three graduate schools in the San Francisco Bay Area: the Starr King School for the Ministry, the University of Creation Spirituality, and the California Institute of Integral Studies.

Name possibly derived from \\"Sacred to Caesar\\" and later Christianized to \\"Saint-Cere\\". During the Carolingian period there was a small village on the hillside, clustered around the Saint Romble Church. An Augustinian abbey was founded in Saint Satur in 1034. A natural fortress 312 meters in height, Sancerre is a former feudal possession of the Counts of Champagne (1152) in the province of Berry. They built a chateau on the hill and ramparts to protect the city. The chateau had six towers including the Tower of the Strongholds (Tour des Fiefs) and the Tower of Saint George. In times of war, a fire was lit on the top of the Saint George tower that could be seen for around. The Customs of Lorris (1155), a charter granted by Stephen I ( Étienne I ) to the merchants of Sancerre was considered one of the most progressive in the Capetian kingdom. In 1184, the Count of Sancerre led a band of rebels called the Brabançons against the king. They were defeated by the Confrères de la Paix, the Confraternity of Peace, a group charged with keeping order in the kingdom. In 1190, Stephen I was among the first feudal lords to abolish serfdom. The fortified city repelled the English forces twice during the Hundred Years' War but much of the surrounding area, including the Augustinian Abbey in Saint Satur and Saint Romble, were destroyed by the forces of Edward, the Black Prince. Sancerre was the seat of Joan of Arc's great comrade-in-arms, Jean V de Bueil. Sancerre was also the site of the infamous Siege of Sancerre (1572–1573) during the Wars of Religion where the Huguenot population held out for nearly eight months against the Catholic forces of the king. The siege was one of the last times in European history where slings (trebuchet), the \\"Arquebuses of Sancerre\\", were used in warfare. The siege was documented by a Protestant minister who survived the battle, Jean de Léry, in The Memorable History of the Siege of Sancerre. In 1621 much of the feudal chateau and city walls were destroyed by orders of the king to prevent further resistance. In 1637 the county was sold by Rene de Bueil to the Prince of Condé, Henry II of Bourbon, the governor of Berry. The area suffered economically from the mass exodus of Protestant merchants, tradesmen and others during the 17th century, especially after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685). During the French Revolution, Sancerre was the site of a royalist rebellion led by Louis- Edmond de Phelippeaux – small \\"Vendee Sancerroise\\". Sancerre was designated the seat of government for the district during the First Republic, but in 1926 the sous-préfecture and other administrative services were transferred to Bourges. Count Jean-Pierre de Montalivet, of Chateau de Thauvenay, Minister of the Interior under Napoleon, was a large landowner in Sancerre during the 19th century. Area transportation was improved by the construction of a suspension bridge at Saint Thibault (1834), the Lateral Canal of the Loire (1838) and later, the Bourges-Sancerre railroad line (1885). A mansion was built on the ruins of the original Chateau de Sancerre in 1874 by Mlle de Crussol d'Uzès in the style of Louis XII. In 1919, the mansion and part of the vineyards were purchased by Louis-Alexandre Marnier-Lapostolle, the liqueur manufacturer. During World War I, Sancerre was the site of a military hospital. During World War II, Sancerre was a regional command center for the French Resistance. \\"Operation Spencer” in 1944 was to prevent the Germans from crossing the Loire River between Gien and Nevers and reinforcing troops in Brittany. The French Resistance and Free French Forces blew up the bridge at Sancerre and sabotaged communication, road, canal and railway lines. On June 25, 1944, German troops based in Cosne-sur-Loire set fire to the village of Thauvenay in reprisal for an ambush of the French Resistance, burning 23 houses, executing six men, a 7-year-old boy and taking eleven people hostage. Among the hostages was Paul de Lavenne de Choulot, comte de Chabaud la Tour, owner of Chateau de Thauvenay. Taken to Bourges, Paul de Choulot pleaded to Alfred Stanke, the \\"Franciscan of Bourges,\\" a German monk and medical orderly who helped save hundreds during World War II, to spare the rest of the commune. Economy Known principally for the production of red wine from the Pinot noir grape until the 20th century, the Sancerre area was devastated by phylloxera in the late 19th century. The vineyards were replanted in Sauvignon blanc (also see Sancerre (wine)). In 1936 Sancerre white was given AOC (INAO) status; reds were classified in 1959. The area now produces white, red and rose wine. The following communes fall inside the \\"Sancerre\\" and \\"Sancerre-Loire Valley\\" controlled label of origin area: Bannay, Bué, Crézancy-en-Sancerre, Menetou- Râtel, Ménétréol-sous-Sancerre, Montigny, Saint-Satur, Sainte-Gemme-en- Sancerrois, Sancerre, Sury-en-Vaux, Thauvenay, Veaugues, Verdigny et Vinon. The area is also noted for its goat cheese. The nearby village of Chavignol, which gave its name to the cheese – Crottin de Chavignol – is located on the territory of the commune.

The Corrupted Blood debuff being spread among characters in Ironforge, one of World of Warcraft's in-game cities. The Corrupted Blood incident was a virtual pandemic in the MMORPG World of Warcraft, which began on September 13, 2005, and lasted for one week. The epidemic began with the introduction of the new raid Zul'Gurub and its end boss Hakkar the Soulflayer. When confronted and attacked, Hakkar would cast a hit point-draining and highly contagious debuff spell called \\"Corrupted Blood\\" on players. The spell, intended to last only seconds and function only within the new area of Zul'Gurub, soon spread across the virtual world by way of an oversight that allowed pets and minions to take the affliction out of its intended confines. By both accidental and then purposeful intent, a pandemic ensued that quickly killed lower-level characters and drastically changed normal gameplay, as players did what they could do to avoid infection. Despite measures such as programmer-imposed quarantines, and the players' abandoning of densely populated cities (or even just not playing the game), it lasted until a combination of patches and resets of the virtual world finally controlled the spread. The conditions and reactions of the event attracted the attention of epidemiologists for its implications of how human populations could react to a real-world epidemic. History The epidemic began on September 13, 2005, when Blizzard introduced a new raid called Zul'Gurub into the game as part of a new update. Its end boss, Hakkar the Soulflayer, could affect a set number of players by applying a contagious debuff called Corrupted Blood, which was countered by players spreading out around the area, away from each other. However, Corrupted Blood could be passed on between any nearby characters, and would kill characters of lower levels in a few seconds, while higher level characters could keep themselves alive. It would disappear as time passed or when the character died. Due to a programming oversight, when hunters or warlocks dismissed their pets, those pets would keep any active debuffs when summoned again. Non-player characters could contract the debuff, and could not be killed by it but could still spread it to players; in effect, this turned them into asymptomatic carriers and a form of vector for the debuff. At least three of the game's servers were affected. The difficulty in killing Hakkar may have limited the spread of the disease. Discussion forum posters described seeing hundreds of bodies lying in the streets of the towns and cities. Deaths in World of Warcraft are not permanent, as characters are resurrected shortly afterward. However, dying in such a way is disadvantageous to the player's character and incurs inconvenience. During the epidemic, normal gameplay was disrupted. The major towns and cities were abandoned by the population as panic set in and players rushed to evacuate to the relative safety of the countryside, leaving urban areas filled with dead player characters. Player responses varied but resembled real-world behaviors. Some characters with healing abilities volunteered their services, some lower-level characters who could not help would direct people away from infected areas, some characters would flee to uninfected areas, and some characters attempted to spread the disease to others. Players in the game reacted to the disease as if there were real risk to their well-being. Blizzard Entertainment attempted to institute a voluntary quarantine to stem the disease, but it failed, as some players didn't take it seriously, while others took advantage of the pandemonium. Despite certain security measures, players overcame them by giving the disease to summonable pets. Blizzard was forced to fix the problem by instituting hard resets of the servers and applying quick fixes. The plague ended on October 8, 2005, when Blizzard made pets unable to be affected by Corrupted Blood, thereby rendering it unable to exist outside of Zul'Gurub. =Reaction= At the time, World of Warcraft had more than two million players all over the world. Before Blizzard Entertainment commented on the outbreak, there was debate whether it was intentional or a glitch. On Blizzard's forums, posters were commenting about how it was a fantastic world event, and calling it \\"the day the plague wiped out Ironforge.\\" An editor of a World of Warcraft fan site described it as the first proper world event. After the incident began, Blizzard received calls from angry customers complaining about how they just died. Some players abandoned the game altogether until the problem was fixed. The hard resets were described as a \\"blunt ending\\" by Gamasutra. The people who spread the disease out of malice were described by Security Focus editor Robert Lemos as terrorists of World of Warcraft. Jeffrey Kaplan—a game designer for World of Warcraft—stated that it gave them ideas for possible real events in the future. Brian Martin—independent security consultant for World of Warcraft—commented that it presented an in-game dynamic that was not expected by players or Blizzard developers and that it reminds people that even in controlled online atmospheres, unexpected consequences can occur. He also compared it to a computer virus, stating that while it is not as serious, it also reminds people of the impact computer code can have on them, and they're not always safe, regardless of the precautions they take. =Great Zombie Plague of '08= During one week of October 2008, a zombie plague was spread to promote the second World of Warcraft expansion, Wrath of the Lich King, before its release. Unlike Corrupted Blood, this plague was intentional and was dubbed by an authorized representative of Blizzard Entertainment as the \\"Great Zombie Plague of '08\\". It was compared to Corrupted Blood by The Sunday Times, which described the zombie plague as being more true-to-life. The plague was contagious, but in contrast to Corrupted Blood, which had 100% transmission to nearby characters, being in the vicinity of a character infected with the zombie plague represented only a small risk of transmission. This meant that encountering a lone zombie was not as dangerous as encountering a large mass of infected individuals. The event—which Blizzard ended on 28 October—earned the company both praise and criticism from its fans. = Green fire = On 12 January 2017, lasting for a day until a hotfix was released by Blizzard, a plague involving a debuff called Burn, that increasingly damaged players over time, started in a boss area. The debuff could be passed between players of the same faction and could kill low-level players in a few seconds. It's believed that the debuff had been taken out of the boss area by a pet. During the incident Blizzard gamemasters \\"disinfected\\" players and kept the plague under control. Models for real-world researchModel for epidemic research= In March 2007, Ran D. Balicer, an epidemiologist physician at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beersheba, Israel, published an article in the journal Epidemiology that described the similarities between this outbreak and the then-recent SARS and avian influenza outbreaks. Dr. Balicer suggested that role-playing games could serve as an advanced platform for modeling the dissemination of infectious diseases. In a follow-up article in the journal Science, the game Second Life was suggested as another possible platform for these studies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contacted Blizzard Entertainment and requested statistics on this event for research on epidemics, but was told that it was a glitch. The Corrupted Blood incident was described as a fascinating yet accidental case study of modeling disease origins and control at the Games for Health conference in Baltimore, Maryland by Gamasutra. They compared it to a real-life epidemic, in that it originated in a remote, uninhabited region and was carried by travelers to larger regions; hosts were both human and animal, comparing it to the avian flu; was passed through close contact; and there were people, in this case non-playable characters, who could contract it but were asymptomatic. However, there were elements that differed from a real-world epidemic, including an indicator for carriers that they have the disease and how much risk they are at, which cannot be done in the real world. One aspect of the epidemic that was not considered by epidemiologists in their models was curiosity, describing how players would rush into infected areas to witness the infection and then rush out. This was paralleled to real-world behavior, specifically with how journalists would cover an incident, and then leave the area. In August 2007, Nina Fefferman—a Tufts University assistant research professor of public health and family medicine—called for research on this incident, citing the resemblances with biological plagues. Some scientists want to study how people would react to environmental pathogens, by using the virtual counterpart as a point of reference. Subsequently, she co-authored a paper in Lancet Infectious Disease discussing the epidemiological and disease modeling implications of the outbreak, along with Eric Lofgren, a University of North Carolina graduate student. She spoke at the 2008 Games for Health conference in Baltimore, Maryland and the 2011 Game Developers Conference about the incident and how massively multiplayer online populations could solve the problems inherent with more traditional models of epidemics. Fefferman added that the three base models have their strengths and weaknesses, but make significant behavioral assumptions. She also compared Corrupted Blood to a drug trial with mice—\\"a real good first step.\\" She stated, \\"These are my mice [and] I want this to be my new experiment setup.\\" She expressed an interest in designing new diseases, perhaps non-fatal ones, to be introduced to the game so she could study how risk is viewed, how rumors would spread, and how public health notices are handled. She added that Blizzard made such notices in the original outbreak, but kept changing its position as it could not effectively deal with the problem. She commented that she did not believe it would ruin gameplay, as World of Warcraft dealt with health challenges in combat, and that games set in medieval times had such health risk. She argued that if researchers and developers worked together, it could be fun. While Blizzard was initially excited about the proposition, it became less outwardly excited over time, though never rejected it. She has been in contact with other developers, hoping to conduct the simulation in games similar to World of Warcraft. Dr. Gary Smith, professor of population biology and epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania, commented that very few mathematical models of disease transmission take host behavior into account, but also questioned how representative of real life a virtual model could be. He stated that while the characteristics of the disease could be defined beforehand, the study is just as observational as one conducted on a real-life disease outbreak. However, he added that one could argue that the proposal could give an opportunity for a study that epidemiologists may never have. Neil Ferguson, director of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College, London, felt skeptical of the idea, commenting that such a study could not properly mimic genuine behavior. Using the zombie plague used to promote World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King before its release as an example, players would intentionally become infected to gain zombie powers. He added that characters could also regenerate, meaning there was low risk in becoming infected. He felt that while online games such as World of Warcraft could be set up to help scientists study epidemics, it will always be limited as their primary use is for entertainment. =Model for terrorism research= In an analysis of the Corrupted Blood incident, Charles Blair, deputy director of the Center of Terrorism and Intelligence Studies, said that World of Warcraft could provide a powerful new way to study how terrorist cells form and operate. While his organization already uses computer models to study terrorists' tactics, Blair explained that because World of Warcraft involves real people making real decisions in a world with controllable bounds, it could provide a more realistic models for military intelligence analysts. Yale University terrorism expert Stuart Gottlieb admitted that while the outbreak was interesting and relevant to the times, he would not base a counter- terrorism strategy on a video game. Gottlieb expressed skepticism that analyzing the incident could shed light on the complex underlying causes of terrorism in the real world, as the stakes for both terrorists and civilians are lowered in a virtual setting. However, as commented by the editor of the article, \\"the biggest weakness for using a game as an analytical tool is that death in World of Warcraft is a nuisance at most\\". Blizzard has maintained a position that World of Warcraft is first and foremost a game, and that it was never designed to mirror reality or anything in the real world. =Comparison to the COVID-19 pandemic= The Corrupted Blood incident has been compared to the COVID-19 pandemic, and epidemiologists who studied the Corrupted Blood outbreak are using the research from the incident to better understand coronavirus's spread - primarily its sociological factors. Dr. Eric Lofgren, an epidemiologist and co-author of a research paper about Corrupted Blood, stated in an interview with PC Gamer that \\"When people react to public health emergencies, how those reactions really shape the course of things. We often view epidemics as these things that sort of happen to people. There's a virus and it's doing things. But really it's a virus that's spreading between people, and how people interact and behave and comply with authority figures, or don't, those are all very important things. And also that these things are very chaotic. You can't really predict 'oh yeah, everyone will quarantine. It'll be fine.' No, they won't.\\" Griefing, such as players intentionally spreading Corrupted Blood to others, was one of the aspects of the Corrupted Blood study that has been criticized as lacking a real-world basis; Dr. Lofgren expressed in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic that \\"one of the critiques we got from a lot of people, both gamers and scientists, was over this idea of griefing, ... How griefing isn't really analogous to anything that takes place in the real world. People aren't intentionally getting people sick. And they might not be intentionally getting people sick, but wilfully ignoring your potential to get people sick is pretty close to that. You start to see people like 'oh this isn't a big deal, I'm not going to change my behavior.' ... Epidemics are a social problem... Minimizing the seriousness of something is sort of real-world griefing.\\" The Corrupted Blood incident was abrupt and far-reaching; Dr. Lofgren expressed that this abruptness is a property of a real pandemic, stating \\"Corrupted Blood was this unexpected black swan event. We treat this [coronavirus] as if it's unexpected, but nature is really good at getting people sick\\". Dr. Nina Fefferman, a co-author of the Corrupted Blood study, expressed that the incident particularly exemplified \\"how people perceive threats and how differences in that perception can change how they behave\\", and how people discuss a threat on social media, stating that \\"A lot of my work since then has been in trying to build models of the social construction of risk perception and I don't think I would have come to that as easily if I hadn't spent time thinking about the discussions WoW players had in real time about Corrupted Blood and how to act in the game based on the understanding they built from those discussions.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Video game controversies Category:Fictional diseases and disorders Category:Video game glitches Category:World of Warcraft Category:2005 in video gaming Category:Epidemiology ","title":"Corrupted Blood incident"},{"id":"2723087","text":"Evan Esar (1899–1995) was an American humorist who wrote Esar's Comic Dictionary in 1943, Humorous English in 1961, and 20,000 Quips and Quotes in 1968.

It is located near Szymany, some 10 km from the centre of Szczytno in the Warmian- Masurian Voivodeship. The airport was previously known as Szymany Airport or Szczytno-Szymany Airport. It originally served as air base for the Germans during World War II and later for the Polish Air Force. After it lost its military importance with the end of the Cold War, it served as a passenger airport for a few years at the turn of the millennium. Flights were sporadic and passenger numbers very low, so it ceased operations again around 2003. The Szymany Airport received international attention after it was discovered the airfield was used by the CIA in conjunction with a black site prison nearby in 2003. From 2014 to 2015, the airport was rebuilt with high EU subsidies as part of the \\"Regional Operational Programme Warmia and Mazury 2007-2013\\". Its runway was extended and overhauled; a new terminal, railway link and further facilities were erected. In January 2016, the airport re-opened for scheduled flights. Location The airport ostensibly serves Olsztyn (population 175,000; its agglomeration comprises 270,000 inhabitants), the capital of Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship (with 1.5 million inhabitants). It is a renovated international airport with old toponymic name Szczytno-Szymany. After years of no passenger operations, it resumed flight service on January 20, 2016 with a flight to Berlin, Germany. The airport has a newly extended and resurfaced runway that is 2500 meters long and 60 meters wide, a new ILS system, and is located in Szymany in Mazury region. Its toponymic Szczytno–Szymany reflects largely obscure localities. The airport management has rebranded the airport to as \\"Olsztyn-Mazury”, that would better encapsulate the whole region of Mazury and its lakes, which is more well known. The airport is situated 59 kilometres to the south of Olsztyn, at the border with more densely populated Mazowsze region. There are also other larger towns (50,000 - 60,000 people) within 60 kilometres of this airport, such as Mława, Ciechanów, Ostrołęka. This airport has in its catchment area a population of 2.7 million people in both voivodeships. In order to provide easy access, a new rail link to the airport was furnished, using a rail branch. The journey to the centre of Olsztyn takes around 50 minutes. In future, a rail link to Białystok through Ostrołęka, and another to Ełk could be organised by putting railcars on unused rail lines. History The first passenger airport in Olsztyn Area was Olsztyn-Dajtki airport that served flights to Bydgoszcz, Warszawa, Gdańsk and Berlin from 1926 until 1958. Despite the eventual cessation of scheduled services between the aforementioned destinations, the airport is still operational as a flight school and general aviation airfield. The airfield in Szymany originates from 1933. Back then it was located in Germany, just kilometres away from the Polish border. Being hidden within the woods, the airfield could be used as a temporary facility during the war. It was used this way in 1939 during the invasion in Poland. In 1945, the small airfield was in the hands of the Soviet army. As they were not interested in the facility, they left it in autumn 1945. Now located in Poland, the Polish army acquired it. In the 1950s and 1960s it was expanded and assigned as backup airport. It was developed on a low stage for many years, in the second half of the 1970s it received a control tower and further buildings. In the 1990s, when the cold war had ended, the airfield in Szymany lost its importance and was finally left. = Passenger operations from 1996 to 2003= In the 1990s, the airport readied to also handle passenger flights. To allow this, a civil airport operator was established in January 1996. A first civil aircraft landed in June 1996, an ATR turboprop aircraft operated by state- owned LOT Polish Airlines To serve these flights a small passenger terminal was opened and operated. The majority of passenger flights to land in Szymany were charter flights from German destinations like Cologne, Dortmund, Hannover and Stuttgart. The flights were sporadic during the summer months. The civil operator was owned through various municipal governments and state companies. It was not very successful and made very high losses. In 2003, passenger flights came to an end. The company ended its activity in 2004 with 3 million Zloty in debts. In 2005, Szymany airport officials were in talks with Ryanair about launching flights from Szymany from 2006 on. The low-cost airline planned to connect Szymany with London and Germany using its Boeing 737-800 aircraft. The resumption of flights would have required renovation and expansion of terminal facilities and the runway, costing some five to six million Polish Zloty. The conferences to open the airport stalled, however, and as a result the airfield was left as it was, without any client/operator running flights to the airfield, save for the occasional business flight. =Involvement in CIA operations= The airport gained attention in the press in 2005, when it was alleged to have a connection with a so-called black site involved in the CIA's network of extraordinary renditions. Terrorist suspects were to be secretly held, and even tortured, in violation of Polish law, by the CIA. Flight records show that an airplane leased by the CIA flying from Kabul to Guantanamo Bay made a stop in Szymany. Officials from the airport have confirmed that some of these flights bypassed normal customs-clearing procedures, and that during the time of these landings, the airport regularly received visits by cars bearing markings associated with the Stare Kiejkuty intelligence training school outside the nearby village of Stare Kiejkuty. As recently as November, 2006, the European Parliament investigative commission led by Claudio Fava had been told, when asked for the flight logs of 11 specific flights observed to have transited through Szymany, that \\"[the records] have [not] been retained, have been faxed and destroyed, and finally said to have been saved in an unspecified place.\\"Brian Knowlton, \\"Report Rejects European Denial Of C.I.A. Prisons\\", New York Times, November 29, 2006. The commission report also quotes Szymany officials as confirming six occasions in 2002 and 2003 when Gulfstream jets bearing civilian registration numbers had landed at the airport, bypassing customs clearance. Airport officials had been directly ordered not to approach the aircraft, and vehicles bearing military registration numbers affiliated with the nearby base at Stare Kiejkuty awaited the arrival of each aircraft. In June 2008 a New York Times article claimed, citing unnamed CIA officers, that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was held in a secret facility in Poland near Szymany Airport and it was there that he was interrogated and waterboarded before beginning to cooperate. In February 2010 Polish officials recanted previous denials, and admitted that at least six CIA flights passed through Szymany in 2003. = Reconstruction as international passenger airport = Following several quiet years, ideas again come up to reconstruct the airport in order to resume passenger services. By the end of 2013, plans became very substantial. An investment of 200 million was planned that included extension and renovation of the runway from 2000 to 2500 metres, aprons, taxiways and a brand new terminal. 76 percent of the investment could be funded by the European Union with local government paying the remainder. EU funds would only be granted as long the reconstruction airport would be operative by the end of 2015, resulting in tight schedule for construction. The initiators of the project estimated a passenger volume of 56.000 travelers in the first years with an expected growth within twenty years to 731.000 passengers. Aircraft movements should initially be around 5600 per year, growing to 17.000 during the same period. In early August 2014, Mostostal won the tender for construction of the terminal after the original tender was cancelled.Terminal interior = Beginning of scheduled passenger services in January 2016 = Airplane to Lviv on apron Check-in desk in the terminal In October, it became public that the airport planned to have connections to Munich, Berlin and Kraków initially. In late October 2015, the airport finally signed an agreement with Polish airline Sprint Air. The airline set aside one 33-seated Saab 340 aircraft for operations. Starting January 2016, the airline would serve Berlin Tegel and Kraków, each thrice- weekly. The contract for the subsidized flights was just valid for the first quarter of 2016 in first place. Tickets to Kraków were available from 99 PLN while Berlin was starting at 149 PLN. On 20 January 2016, the first ever scheduled passenger flight took off from the airport with a SprintAir service to Berlin Tegel Airport. On 7 March 2016, the airport announced that it has extended its contract with Sprint Air beyond late March to 3 June 2016. The continues to service Berlin Tegel and Kraków thrice weekly, although with a slightly modified schedule. The first jet route was announced to Munich on 1 April 1, 2016. Starting 17 June 2016, Adria Airways would operate a thrice- weekly connection to Munich onboard its CRJ aircraft. Adria Airways is the flag-carrier of Slovenia, but at this time had already gained a lot of experience outside of Slovenia, also in Poland where an aircraft is based in Łódź. Furthermore, it is active in Albania and Kosova and supports the establishment of the new Estonian flag-carrier. Another route was just one week later, a thrice-weekly connection to London Luton operated by Wizzair. Wizzair thereby made Olsztyn Mazury its ninth destination in Poland. Flights were due to commence just one day after the Adria Airways launch, on 18 June 2016. Wizz Air is known for their all-Airbus fleet of A320s and A321s, meaning that a greater number of passengers can be served through the airport rather than with CRJs and Dash-8 aircraft alone. On 23 May, SprintAir got renewed its contract to also cover flights beyond June 5 to the end of the summer schedule. In this occasion, a third route with the airline to Wroclaw, starting on June 6, was announced. Ryanair was then selected to become the second low-cost carrier to land in Olsztyn. Commencing on 1 November 2016, the carrier was set to service London Stansted thrice a week on its Boeing 737-800 aircraft, despite the fact that its counterpart Wizzair already would serve London Luton thrice a week then. The decision was made public on 31 May with a promotional flight was done to the airport. By mid-June 2016, LOT Polish Airlines opened bookings for a three-weekly service from Olsztyn to their hub Warsaw on board their 78-seated Bombardier Q400. Running in the middle of the day, the service should deliver many connection options to other destinations within the LOT network. Flights were announced to take place from 2 July to 1 October 2016. In the first of months of operation, the airport saw only two routes flown by Sprint Air. However, a lot of new airlines were announced in the meanwhile as outlined, namely Adria Airways, LOT Polish Airlines, Ryanair and Wizzair. The first of them to start was Adria Airways in June. On 30 July 2016, the new Olsztyn-Mazury Airport handled its 15.000th passenger. In August, Adria Airways announced that it would terminate its subsidies route to Munich on October 28. SprintAir operated its final service in Szymany on October 30 after its contract was terminated. Thereby, only low-cost flights were scheduled during the winter schedule 2016/17.  Airlines and destinations  The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Olsztyn:mazuryairport.pl - Flights retrieved 13 November 2016  Ground transportation  Platform of the airport station The airport has railroad access that has been operative since the scheduled flights started in January 2016. The distance to the town of Olsztyn is 55 kilometres, with the journey taking 50 minutes. As of April 2016, trains run synchronized with the flights. Rail services are currently performed by government-owned Przewozy Regionalne. To adequately service the anticipated new airport, an existing rail line from Olsztyn to Szczytno (line 219) and a section of the disused railway 35 line between Szczytno and Szymany were renovated. The renovation allows trains to travel at up to 100 kilometres per hour on a single-track line without electrification. The tender was closed in 2011. Later on a short branch line to the airport and a new station at the airport connected the service. Overall, the reconstruction of existing infrastructure and the new spur had a planned value of PLN 115M (€27.2M), of which PLN 68M (€16.1M) was funded through the European Union. Following the completion of the renovation of the railway Olsztyn-Szczytno-Szymany and the decision to rebuild the airport, the construction of an airport link was announced in early 2014. The tender was closed in September 2014 and contained the construction of a 1.6-kilometre branch line between connecting railway line 35 with the airport, a railway station at the airport and a control centre at Szczytno. This project had a value of more than 60M PLN.

He has since become a sideline commentator for the NRL with Foxsports. He is widely known for his father being Rugby League legend Johnny Raper and he also is the only Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks coach to win the President's Cup (under-21s) for the club in 1994. Playing career Raper originally signed on to play with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in the early 1980s, and made his first grade début at the age of 18 against the Illawarra Steelers in round 25 of the 1983 NSWRFL season. After a promising start to his first grade career he was never able to live up to his famous father's shadow while at the Sharks and after only eight first grade games with them in three years, decided it was best to move on in an attempt to further his career. Raper moved to England for the 1986/87 season and signed for Oldham. Raper made 31 appearances for Oldham in that season and scored 11 tries but his efforts didn't prevent Oldham from being relegated from the 1st Division. He left the club at the end of the season. In 1989 Raper signed on with Sydney's Western Suburbs Magpies on a one-year deal with the club. His opportunities though were yet again limited and after only a mere five appearances for the season his contract was not renewed and his first grade career came to an end. =County Cup Final appearances= Stuart Raper played , in Oldham's 6–27 defeat by Wigan in the 1986–87 Lancashire County Cup Final at Knowsley Road, St. Helens on Sunday 19 October 1986. Coaching career After a brief playing career with both the Cronulla- Sutherland Sharks and the Western Suburbs Magpies Raper signed on to his first coaching role in 1994 with the Under 21s Sharks side. Here Raper inherited an extremely talented side (featuring Adam Dykes, Geoff Bell and David Peachey) and with them excelled as he took the team to the club's first President's Cup in his début season as coach. Following his immediate success with the Under 21 side he was duly appointed as the new coach of the Sharks reserve grade side for the 1995 season. More success followed for Raper (as he inherited much the same side from his Under 21 coaching days) as after two seasons he was successful in coaching his side to the reserve grade title in 1996. =Castleford Tigers= After a successful 1996 season at home with Cronulla, Raper was offered the head coaching role at English Super League club the Castleford Tigers and joined on 27 April 1997. At the start of 1997's Super League II Castleford were seen by many as a team simply making up the numbers and few held hopes for their survival to avoid being relegated. Throughout the season they continually struggled large parts and in the end only just managed to avoid being relegated, eventually finishing tenth. With a new season in 1998 many pundits predicted the Tigers would be one of the sides to face the drop down to National League One by the end of the season. With the odds stacked against Raper and his position continually under pressure after a poor first season he defied many odds by keeping his Castleford side near the top of the table for the majority of the season in which they eventually finished sixth. The 1999 season saw the Castleford Tigers continue their progress. The season started with the side missing out on the last Challenge Cup Final to be held at Wembley Stadium after a last-gasp score saw London Broncos knock the side out. The positive cup run continued into the league and the Castleford Tigers ended the league season in the top 5. Raper masterminded the side past Wigan Warriors and local rivals Leeds Rhinos and took the Tigers within 80 minutes of the Grand Final at Old Trafford. They were knocked out in the last knock-out stage by St. Helens. The 1999 season still stands as the most successful for the Castleford Tigers in the Super League era and because of it Raper is still highly regarded in the hearts of the club's fans. 2000 was Raper's last season with the Castleford Tigers and his performance somewhat mirrored their previous season as he yet again took his side to a finishing place of fifth and into the finals for a consecutive season. He took the opportunity to coach Wigan Warriors after not being provided with the finances he claimed were required to take the Tigers onto the next level. The club subsequently fell into decline and were relegated in 2005 - a fate that would have arguably come much earlier without Raper's guidance. =Wigan Warriors= At the end of another successful season in 2000 with the Castleford Tigers, Raper was offered the head coaching role at Super League giants the Wigan Warriors for the 2001 season. His first season in charge at his new club proved to be a fruitful one for Raper as the Warriors finished second on the end of season table and made it all the way to the 2001 Super League Grand Final; although they ended up losing to the Bradford Bulls in a somewhat poor performance for the club's usually high standards. He remained with Wigan for a further two seasons in 2002 and 2003 where they finished a respectable third in both seasons though were never able to progress to the Final and obtain a Super League title in either. Raper did however enjoy his first piece of English rugby league silverware in 2002 when he took his Wigan Warriors side to victory in the Challenge Cup. They beat non-other than local rivals St. Helens, 21–12. =Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks= During the 2004 season Raper was called home to the Sharks and originally found himself as an assistant coach to then head coach Chris Anderson. Though before the season's end he was called on to take the reins of their first grade squad. At the start of his tenure at the Sharks, the former Cronulla pupil was given the task of rebuilding the club after they failed to make the NRL playoffs in 2003 for the first time in four seasons. While Raper's first season record after taking over from Anderson was modest, he and his coaching team dealt with several obstacles in 2004 and showed some classy football against the top sides. 2005 started very well for Cronulla and Raper, however, by the end of the season the Sharks had limped home into 7th place in the finals. This for slump coincided with playmaker Brett Kimmorley's poor performance in Game I of the 2005 State of Origin series, and further poor performances after his axing from the representative side. The Sharks lost to St George Illawarra in the first round of the semi finals and were eliminated. 2006 was to be Stuart Raper's final season at the club. Raper came under heavy criticism for the way he coached the side, mostly for his persistence with the Adam Dykes/Brett Kimmorley halves pairing, which many deemed to be unsuccessful. Raper was also criticised for not having a structured game plan as well as other questionable player selections. The season ended with a 10-game losing streak, including losses to a heavily depleted Brisbane Broncos side, as well as a second half capitulation at home against Penrith, where Raper's team let in 20 points in 16 minutes to lose a seemingly un-losable game. Ricky Stuart was appointed as Rapers replacement for 2007. He now worked as a commentator and analyst for Fox Sports. In 2017, he was appointed as Referees High Performance Manager for the New South Wales Rugby League  References External links * Stuart Raper Wigan Coaching Career Page on the Wigan RL Fansite.

The school serves portions of Long Beach, including Bixby Knolls, and some parts of the cities of Signal Hill and Lakewood. Polytechnic (more commonly known as Poly) is the flagship high school of the Long Beach Unified School District. It is a large urban high school with about 4,000 students. Polytechnic has long been distinguished in both academics and athletics. The PACE (Program of Accelerated Curricular Experiences, founded in 1975 by Dr. Nancy Gray, a teacher and administrator for the Long Beach School system), and the CIC (Center of International Curriculum) magnet programs boast more total University of California admissions than any other high school in California. In 2005, Sports Illustrated magazine named Polytechnic the \\"Sports School of the Century\\", in recognition of the school's badminton, baseball, basketball, football, track, cross country, swimming, water polo, wrestling, tennis, golf, and softball teams. Polytechnic has also received numerous prizes for its music program, including six Grammy Awards, two of them being \\"golden signature\\" Grammy Awards. Long Beach Poly has sent more players to the NFL than any other high school in the country, sending over 60 throughout the history of the school. Long Beach Poly was also ranked number one in a list of the best high school athletic programs in the nation by Sports Illustrated. HistoryEarly years= Long Beach Polytechnic High School began offering classes in 1895 in order to help educate the growing population of Long Beach. The first classes were at the Methodist Tabernacle Chapel, and the first principal was Walter S. Bailey. The first graduating class was in 1897 and only had one student. During this same year, classes were moved to Chautauqua Hall at Fourth Street and Pine Avenue as work began on the new Long Beach High School. Long Beach High School was completed in 1898 and featured four classrooms and an assembly hall. The following year, the Long Beach High School Athletic Association was formed. In 1903, the school yearbook, Caerulea, was first published. Football and basketball programs began in 1904. The first student government was established in 1906. David Burcham became school principal the following year, a position he would hold until 1941. The girls' basketball program won three consecutive state championships, from 1907 to 1909. In 1911, Long Beach Poly moved to the location at 16th Street and Atlantic, offering more space and amenities. JROTC began in 1917, and an influenza epidemic swept through the school population. The following year, rabbits began invading the playing fields, inspiring the track team to call themselves the Jackrabbits; this eventually became the official school mascot. The athletic field was dedicated as \\"David Burcham Field\\" in 1924 to honor the long-serving principal. During much of the 1920s, Poly was the largest high school west of the Mississippi River in terms of student population. A new auditorium was constructed in 1931. The Long Beach earthquake damaged the school in 1933. Following the earthquake, bricks from the damage were sold in order to pay for a memorial flagpole which still stands. A new science building was built and the auditorium was remodeled in 1935. A new administration building was completed the following year. In 1937, Poly graduated over 1,000 students for the first time. The 1976 edition of the school's Caerulea yearbook =1940s–1970s= The school celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1945. Wooden bleachers that had lined the athletic fields burned down in 1952 and the new Veteran's Stadium became the new home field for the Jackrabbits. The library was completed in 1953. In 1969, a racist leaflet was published, prompting approximately 100 white and African-American students to fight, leaving 24 students injured. Homecoming titles (King and Queen) were ended in 1971 due to racial tensions. In 1975, PACE (Program of Additional Curricular Experiences), which included one of the first offerings of advanced college placement courses for high school students, began. Badminton began in 1977, and girls' track and gymnastics teams started the following year. =1980s–present= The Center for International Commerce (CIC) began in 1982. In 1984, Poly was recognized by USA Today as the top ranked school nationally in terms of Moore League, CIF, and state titles. Poly received the Distinguished School Recognition Award in 1986, the California Department of Education's highest award. Poly became a four-year school in 1989. A new science building was completed in 1993. The school celebrated its 100-year anniversary in 1995. The Poly music program was recognized as a Grammy Signature School Gold in 2000, one of the top ten music programs in the country. Poly received this honor in 2003 as well. In 2005, Harvard recognized Poly as the most successful high school in the nation in terms of number of graduates. Also in 2005, Sports Illustrated named the Poly as the #1 sports high school in the nation. In 2006, security was increased and school IDs were required to be worn at all times while on campus.  Academics  The school motto states that Poly is the \\"Home of Scholars and Champions\\". The PACE and CIC magnet programs are highly desired destinations for students throughout the South Bay & Northern Orange County. In 2008, 1,573 AP exams were administered at Poly with over 75% of testees receiving a passing score of 3 or higher. The national pass rate in 2008 was slightly over 58%. Poly also has the highest academic performance index of any traditional high school in Long Beach with a 2009 score of 747. It consistently ranks a 9 out of 10 when compared to schools with similar demographics since 2007. Pac Rim is a California magnet academy for students interested in business. Polytechnic High also includes the Beach, Justice, METS, and MEDS academies. Athletics Long Beach Polytechnic offers a wide variety of sports and activities due to its large size and diverse student population. Athletic teams compete in Division I within the California Interscholastic Federation and are known as the Jackrabbits. Throughout the school's history, the Jackrabbits have won many state championships and have produced several collegiate and professional athletes. In 2005, Sports Illustrated magazine named Polytechnic the \\"Sports School of the Century\\", in recognition of the school's badminton, baseball, basketball, football, track, cross country, swimming, water polo, tennis, golf, and softball teams. =Football= Long Beach Poly has maintained a successful football program and has produced more NFL players than any other high school in the nation, over 60 throughout school history. Early years Poly played its first football game in 1908 and featured its first African-American player in 1934. After losing their opener, the Jackrabbits won their first game 10-0 vs. Occidental Prep. In 1917, head coach Eddie Kienholz left the team to fight in World War I. The 1919 Poly team went 12-0 and won their first state championship over Berkeley High School by a score of 21–14. Following the state championship, Poly defeated Phoenix High School by a score of 102–0 in the Southwest Championship. Poly won additional CIF titles in 1923 and 1927. Orian Landreth became the head coach in 1929 and won the CIF title vs. Santa Barbara High School. Poly repeated as CIF champions in 1930, and also won titles in 1934 and 1936. From 1942 to 1956, the football program experienced down years, producing just four winning seasons. The 1959 and 1960 teams led by quarterback Bud Hollowell went 22-0-1 and claimed two CIF titles. The 1959 team is best known for the \\"ICBM\\" backfield of Lonzo Irvin, Harvey Crow, Willie Brown and Willie Martin. 1960s–present From 1965 to 1979, the Jackrabbits experienced a second drought of success, making the playoffs five times in 15 seasons. The 1973 team went winless and the 1979 team was forced to forfeit all of its wins due to ineligible players. Poly won the CIF title in 1980 and were runners-up in 1981 and 1982. The Jackrabbits shared a title in 1985, sharing with Edison High School after a 14–14 tie. Poly experienced increased success in the 1990s and 2000s, winning CIF titles in 1997, 1999 and 2000. The 2001 team featured Marcedes Lewis, Hershel Dennis, Winston Justice, and Darnell Bing. Despite the talent, the team finished runner-up to De La Salle High School. The Jackrabbits won the CIF title in 2004 behind DeSean Jackson and won additional titles in 2007, 2008 and 2012. Former New York Giant Antonio Pierce was hired as head coach before the 2014 season. 4th and Forever A reality television on Current TV, titled 4th and Forever, focuses on the school's strong football program. It has been called the real- life version of Friday Night Lights, but has also been derided as inaccurate and \\"[relying] on repetitive reality-show conventions\\".  Controversies  2001: Campus arrest and suicide of student Andreas Wickstrom = On December 5, 2001, a school clerk informed a supervisor that he had found a bag of marijuana on campus, in the car of Andreas Wickstrom. The police were notified first, before Andreas's parents, John and Inge Wickstrom. Andreas was arrested and immediately taken to the youth detention facility on Pacific Avenue. Andreas was released in the custody of his mother, who \\"knew he was in pain\\" but did not suspect he would harm himself. Three hours after his arrest, Andreas shot himself at home with a shotgun belonging to his grandfather, a retired police officer. Inge recalled, \\"Andreas kept saying that they treated him like a criminal. There was no protection for him... At least if I had been called to go to the school, I could have reassured him that everything was going to be OK. The very people to whom I had entrusted his care that morning at Poly failed to protect him when he most needed it. If he had a headache or had injured himself, I would have been called immediately.\\" = 2005: Graduation ceremony shooting = At 8:40pm on June 15, 2005, a fight began outside of Long Beach Veteran's Memorial Stadium, followed by a shooting during the Long Beach Polytechnic High School graduation ceremony. \\"Authorities believe that someone was injured and driven from the scene because they discovered drops of blood. The victim, however, had not shown up at any area hospital, officials said. Two handguns were found at the scene, but it was unclear if either was the weapon involved.

(February 12, 1907 – February 17, 1962) was an American actor, who is best remembered for his role as George Wilson (\\"Mr. Wilson\\") on the CBS television series Dennis the Menace from 1959 until his death in 1962, and for providing the voice of the Doorknob in the 1951 animated Disney film, Alice in Wonderland. Early life Born in Salt Lake City, Utah, Kearns moved with his family to California when he was very young. His mother was Cordelia M. Kearns (née Peterson; 1877–1962), a concert pianist, from whom Kearns derived his love of music. He and his family were devout Mormons, whose ancestors were Mormon pioneers. His first experience of acting was in 1916 when he joined 'The Rising Generation\\", a vaudeville troupe of eleven children that toured for 14 months. He studied at the University of Utah, teaching a course in theatrical make-up to fund his tuition. After graduating from college, he briefly tried his hand at wool buying and worked for his father for a year. Kearns traveled the West as a representative of Howell, Jones and Donnell of Boston. His wool-buying career came to an abrupt end when Kearns purchased five boxcars full of black wool from a breed called Karakul for $8,000. The problem was that black wool could not be dyed and no one knew how to use it in those days. After this fiasco, Kearns gladly gave up the wool business and pursued a show business career. CareerRadio= Kearns joined the staff of radio station KSL in Salt Lake City in 1930 remaining there until 1936 when he moved to Los Angeles. Kearns began his acting career in radio in the 1930s (playing the Crazyquilt Dragon in the serial The Cinnamon Bear), becoming active during the 1940s, with appearances on the shows The Adventures of Sam Spade, Burns and Allen, The Whistler, and dozens of other shows. On Suspense, he was almost a mainstay, heard regularly as the host \\"The Man in Black\\" in the early years, announcing many episodes in the later run, and playing supporting and occasional lead roles in hundreds of shows throughout the series' tenure in Hollywood, from judges to kindly old- timers to cowards. He also appeared on The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, playing various different characters including Professor Moriarty and even Dr. Watson. Kearns played Ed, the security guard for Jack Benny's underground money vault, on The Jack Benny Program. The running gag was that Benny had kept Ed on duty at the vault's door so long that the guard was not conversant with current events. When Benny informed him that \\"The War\\" (World War II) had ended, Ed asked whether the \\"North\\" or the \\"South\\" had won, assuming that the American Civil War was the war Benny referred to. He played numerous parts on the Benny show, including an IRS Agent. (\\"NO ONE yells at a tax collector, Mr. Benny!\\"). He appeared in regular roles on The Mel Blanc Show (as the cantankerous father of Mel's on-air girl friend, Betty, played by Mary Jane Croft) and The Harold Peary Show as Old Doc Yak-Yak. He also played numerous comedic parts on Judy Canova's radio show, including her \\"dumb boyfriend\\", Lukey. =Film career= Kearns made his film debut in Hard, Fast and Beautiful (1951). He was the voice of the Doorknob in Disney's animated film, Alice in Wonderland (1951). Kearns appeared in other movies, making his final film appearance as the crime photographer in Anatomy of a Murder (1959). =Television= Joseph Kearns (right) with the cast of Dennis the Menace (1960) On television, Kearns reprised his radio roles on The Jack Benny Program and also appeared with Eve Arden and Richard Crenna in Our Miss Brooks (1953–55), first as Assistant Superintendent Michaels and later (in eight episodes) as Superintendent Stone, a role that he had played on radio. He appeared on The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show a total of 11 times, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet a total of 16 times, I Love Lucy, My Little Margie, Perry Mason, I Married Joan, December Bride, It's a Great Life, Angel, Gunsmoke, and General Electric Theater. Kearns played Fred on Professional Father. In 1959, Kearns appeared as criminologist Edward Langley in the Perry Mason episode, \\"The Case of the Perjured Parrot\\". Dennis the Menace Kearns' final role was as George Wilson, the grouchy, cantankerous neighbor on CBS's Dennis the Menace based on the comic strip by Hank Ketcham. After his death, Kearns was replaced in the cast by Gale Gordon, who played George Wilson's brother John. Kearns and Gordon had worked together prior to Dennis the Menace, on the old radio show The Cinnamon Bear. and in the 1956 film Our Miss Brooks. In the last episode that aired before Kearns' death, episode 89 entitled \\"Where There's a Will\\", the story dealt with Mr. Wilson making out a will and explaining that Dennis would inherit his gold watch when he dies. The last episode Kearns filmed was titled \\"The Man Next Door\\", episode 100, and shown on May 6, 1962, three months after his death. There were references to George being 'back east' in subsequent shows. =Personal life= Kearns never married nor had any children. Describing himself as a night owl who hated to get up early in the morning, Kearns enjoyed cooking, reading novels, writing, traveling, going to the movies, and playing cards in his spare time. He was a member of the exclusive Société des Gentilhommes Chefs de Cuisine, a club for gentlemen chefs. The members traded original recipes with other club members. Kearns also wrote plays and scripts for his various radio shows. His favorite hobby was playing the organ. Kearns, who was musically trained by his mother, had played the pipe organ for a Los Angeles theatre in the 1930s. He purchased a Hammond organ and installed it in a studio apartment that he designed and built in the 1940s. He later purchased a larger 18-rank Wurlitzer organ that had been designed for Warner Brothers in 1929. He then designed and built a soundproof 2-1/2 story home around the organ. Kearns delighted in playing the organ for his guests. A Republican, he supported Dwight Eisenhower during the 1952 presidential election.Motion Picture and Television Magazine, November 1952, page 34, Ideal Publishers Death Kearns suffered a cerebral hemorrhage on February 11, 1962, during the third season of Dennis the Menace, after being on the Metrecal diet for six weeks Kearns was hospitalized, but never regained consciousness and died on February 17, 1962, five days after his 55th birthday. He was buried at the Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles. Selected filmography *The Hucksters (1947) – Radio Voice (uncredited) *Hard, Fast and Beautiful (1951) – J.R.

Founded by non-Indians in Philadelphia in 1882, the Indian Rights Associations (IRA) was highly influential in American Indian policy through the 1930s and remained involved as an organization until 1994. The organization's initial stated objective was to \\"bring about the complete civilization of the Indians and their admission to citizenship.\\" In 1884, the organization's founders, Herbert Welsh and Henry Spackman Pancoast, opened an additional office in Washington D.C. to act as a legislative lobby and liaison with the Board of Indian Commissioners and the Board of Indian Affairs. The IRA also opened an early office in Boston, Massachusetts. The management of early Indian Rights Association's programs fell almost entirely to five men, all of whom had lengthy careers with the IRA: Herbert Welsh, Matthew Sniffen, and Lawrence E. Lindley, active in Philadelphia; and Charles C. Painter and Samuel M. Brosius, agents and lobbyists in Washington D.C. In addition to efforts on policy development and congressional lobbying, the Indian Rights Association monitored the actions of Bureau of Indian Affairs agents and observed Native American living conditions and health care needs through correspondence and trips to reservations and settlements. They also sponsored speaking tours for activists and Indian representatives as a means of informing the public about native issues. The Unitarian minister and journalist Jonathan Baxter Harrison was an especially influential observer, publishing several books and articles detailing his findings in the late 1880s.

A profilometer is a measuring instrument used to measure a surface's profile, in order to quantify its roughness. Critical dimensions as step, curvature, flatness are computed from the surface topography. While the historical notion of a profilometer was a device similar to a phonograph that measures a surface as the surface is moved relative to the contact profilometer's stylus, this notion is changing with the emergence of numerous non-contact profilometry techniques. Non- scanning technologies are able to measure the surface topography within a single camera acquisition, XYZ scanning is no longer needed. As a consequence, dynamic changes of topography are measured in real-time. Contemporary profilometers are not only measuring static topography, but now also dynamic topography – such systems are described as time-resolved profilometers. Types Original 1940s Taylor-Hobson Talysurf surface profile measuring machine Optical methodsJean M. Bennett, Lars Mattsson, Introduction to Surface Roughness and Scattering, Optical Society of America, Washington, D.C.W J Walecki, F Szondy and M M Hilali, \\"Fast in-line surface topography metrology enabling stress calculation for solar cell manufacturing for throughput in excess of 2000 wafers per hour\\" 2008 Meas. Sci. Technol. 19 025302 (6pp) include interferometry based methods such as digital holographic microscopy, vertical scanning interferometry/white light interferometry, phase shifting interferometry, and differential interference contrast microscopy (Nomarski microscopy); ocus detection methods such as intensity detection, focus variation, differential detection, critical angle method, astigmatic method, foucault method, and confocal microscopy; pattern projection methods such as Fringe projection, Fourier profilometry, Moire, and pattern reflection methods. Contact and pseudo-contact methods include stylus profilometer (mechanical profilometer) atomic force microscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy  Contact profilometers  A diamond stylus is moved vertically in contact with a sample and then moved laterally across the sample for a specified distance and specified contact force. A profilometer can measure small surface variations in vertical stylus displacement as a function of position. A typical profilometer can measure small vertical features ranging in height from 10 nanometres to 1 millimetre. The height position of the diamond stylus generates an analog signal which is converted into a digital signal, stored, analyzed, and displayed. The radius of diamond stylus ranges from 20 nanometres to 50 μm, and the horizontal resolution is controlled by the scan speed and data signal sampling rate. The stylus tracking force can range from less than 1 to 50 milligrams. Advantages of contact profilometers include acceptance, surface independence, resolution, it is a direct technique with no modeling required. Most of the world's surface finish standards are written for contact profilometers. To follow the prescribed methodology, this type of profilometer is often required. Contacting the surface is often an advantage in dirty environments where non-contact methods can end up measuring surface contaminants instead of the surface itself. Because the stylus is in contact with the surface, this method is not sensitive to surface reflectance or color. The stylus tip radius can be as small as 20 nanometres, significantly better than white-light optical profiling. Vertical resolution is typically sub-nanometer as well.  Non-contact profilometers  An optical profilometer is a non-contact method for providing much of the same information as a stylus based profilometer. There are many different techniques which are currently being employed, such as laser triangulation (triangulation sensor), confocal microscopy (used for profiling of very small objects), low coherence interferometry and digital holography. Advantages of optical profilometers are speed, reliability and spot size. For small steps and requirements to do 3D scanning, because the non-contact profilometer does not touch the surface the scan speeds are dictated by the light reflected from the surface and the speed of the acquisition electronics. For doing large steps, a 3D scan on an optical profiler can be much slower than a 2D scan on a stylus profiler. Optical profilometers do not touch the surface and therefore cannot be damaged by surface wear or careless operators. Many non-contact profilometers are solid-state which tends to reduce the required maintenance significantly. The spot size, or lateral resolution, of optical methods ranges from a few micrometres down to sub micrometre. = Time-resolved profilometers = Self-Healing-Polymer from Tosoh Corporation (Japan) measured by Digital Holographic Microscope MEMS Ultrasonic-Transducers measured at 8 MHz in stroboscopic mode Non-scanning technologies as digital holographic microscopy enable 3D topography measurement in real-time. 3D topography is measured from a single camera acquisition as a consequence the acquisition rate is only limited by the camera acquisition rate, some systems measure topography at a frame rate of 1000 fps. Time-resolved systems enable measurement of topography changes as healing of smart materials or measurement of moving specimens. Time-resolved profilometers can be combined with a stroboscopic unit to measure MEMS vibrations in the MHz range. The stroboscopic unit provides excitation signal to the MEMS and provides trigger signal to light source and camera. The advantage of time-resolved profilometers is that they are robust against vibrations. Unlike scanning methods, time-resolved profilometer acquisition time is in the milliseconds range. There is no need of vertical calibration: vertical measurement does not depend on a scanning mechanism, digital holographic microscopy vertical measurement has an intrinsic vertical calibration based on laser source wavelength. Samples are not static and there is response of the specimen topography to external stimulus. With on-flight measurement the topography of a moving sample is acquired with short exposure time. MEMS vibrations measurement can be accomplished when the system is combined with a stroboscopic unit. =Fiber-based optical profilometers= Optical fiber-based optical profilometers scan surfaces with optical probes which send light interference signals back to the profilometer detector via an optical fiber. Fiber-based probes can be physically located hundreds of meters away from the detector enclosure, without signal degradation. The additional advantages of using fiber-based optical profilometers are flexibility, long profile acquisition, ruggedness, and ease of incorporating into industrial processes. With the small diameter of certain probes, surfaces can be scanned even inside hard-to-reach spaces, such as narrow crevices or small-diameter tubes. Because these probes generally acquire one point at a time and at high sample speeds, acquisition of long (continuous) surface profiles is possible. Scanning can take place in hostile environments, including very hot or cryogenic temperatures, or in radioactive chambers, while the detector is located at a distance, in a human-safe environment. Fiber-based probes are easily installed in-process, such as above moving webs or mounted onto a variety of positioning systems.

Well established as one of the most widely read and beloved books for children in Sweden, it was originally published in the autumn of 1973 and has since been translated into 46 languages. Like several of Lindgren's works, the book has a melancholy tone, and many of its themes are unusually dark for the children's book genre. Disease, death, tyranny, betrayal, and rebellion form the backdrop of the story, against which are contrasted platonic love, loyalty, sacrifice, hope, courage, and pacifism. The two main characters are two brothers: the brave and popular Jonatan and his admiring younger brother, Karl. The two brothers' surname is originally Lion, though the courageous Jonatan is known as \\"Lionheart.\\" Karl's nickname is Skorpan (Rusky) since Jonatan loves these typical Swedish toasts or crusts as much as he loves his little brother. The introduction of the story depicts a small apartment in an impoverished area of Sweden, where Skorpan is bedridden with tuberculosis and, the reader is given to understand, unlikely to survive. Jonatan seeks to comfort his little brother by telling him about Nangijala, a land beyond death, where there are \\"sagas and campfires.\\" Unexpectedly, Jonatan dies in an accident, leaving his brother alone. Soon after, Skorpan dies from his disease, and is reunited with Jonatan in Nangijala, where he, too, will be named Lionheart. The brothers experience adventures: together with a resistance group, they join the struggle against the tyrant Tengil, who rules with the aid of the fearsome fire-breathing dragon, Katla. These adventures form the greater part of the book. To older readers, the book is deliberately ambiguous about how much of the plot is in fact real, keeping open a possibility that it represents Skorpan's fever dreams and imagination, based on the hopeful stories told to him by his brother. Plot In an unnamed Swedish city, ten year-old Karl Lejon has found out that he is going to die from an unspecified pulmonary disease (most likely tuberculosis). His adored big brother, 13-year-old Jonatan, calms him down and tells him that in the afterlife, all men will go to a land known as Nangijala. One day, a fire breaks out in the Lejon home. Jonatan takes Karl on his back and jumps out of the house's window to save him, but dies himself in the fall. Karl is crestfallen over his brother's death, until, just before his own demise, he receives a sign which allays his fears of death, and when he wakes again, he finds himself in the Cherry Valley of Nangijala, where he is happily reunited with Jonatan. Karl is introduced to the denizens of the valley, particularly Sofia the dove-keeper, Hubert the hunter, and Jossi, a landlord, and assumes the surname Lionheart along with his brother. However, despite first appearances, not all is truly at peace in Nangijala. The adjacent valley, the Thorn Rose Valley, is suppressed by a tyrant named Tengil, his army and a female dragon named Katla, who is controlled by Tengil through a trumpet. The people of the Cherry Valley, led by Sofia, are aiding the resistance movement in the Thorn Rose Valley, but they know someone from the Cherry Valley is helping Tengil, as Sofia's white doves, which transport secret messages between the valleys, are being shot. Soon after Karl's arrival, Jonatan leaves to assist the Thorn Rose people. Prompted by a nightmare in which he sees Jonatan in danger, Karl follows him in the middle of the night; but while hiding in a cave, he witnesses a clandestine exchange between two of Tengil's soldiers and Jossi, who has turned traitor to his people. Soon after Jossi leaves, Karl is discovered by the soldiers and taken to the Thorn Rose Valley after claiming that he lives there with his grandfather. After arriving at a village, Karl throws himself into the arms of the first old man he encounters when he sees white pigeons with him, and surprisingly the old man - by the name of Mattias - takes him in without question. It turns out that Mattias is part of the Thorn Valley resistance and a friend of Jonatan, who is hiding in his house. Jonatan, a hero among the Thorn Rose Valley people, is intent on freeing Orvar, the leader of the Thorn Valley resistance movement who is kept in the cave of Karmanjaka near the Karma Falls, where Katla dwells, with his release sparking the long-anticipated final uprising against Tengil. The Lionheart Brothers soon depart for Karmanjaka and manage to release Orvar moments before he is to be collected and fed to Katla, but their escape is soon discovered. They ride back as fast as they can towards the Karma Falls, but the pursuing soldiers start overtaking Karl and Jonatan. Karl throws himself off the horse and hides so that Jonatan and Orvar can escape, but soon afterwards he encounters Sofia and Hubert, who are being led into a trap by Jossi. Karl denounces Jossi as the traitor, and while trying to escape by boat, Jossi is carried by the river's current to the Karma Falls, where he perishes. The Thorn Rose people rise and engage Tengil's forces in battle, but Tengil calls Katla, who begins to decimate the rebels' ranks, including Hubert and Mattias. Jonatan manages to snatch the trumpet from Tengil and bring Katla under his control, compelling her to kill Tengil. Considering Katla an ever- lingering danger despite her current docility, the people decide to get rid of her once and for all, and Jonatan and Karl volunteer for this task. They lure the dragon to Karmanjaka, where they intend to seal her inside her cave to be weakened by starvation; but while navigating the treacherous path, Jonatan loses the trumpet, which frees Katla from his control and drives her into chasing them. The Lionheart Brothers barely escape with their lives when an ancient lindworm, Karm, suddenly rises from the waters and engages Katla in mortal combat, which ends with the two monsters killing each other. Jonatan and Karl set up a camp for the night, and Jonatan explains that during their flight he was burned by Katla's fire and that he will soon die. Jonatan tells Karl about the land that lies after Nangijala called Nangilima, a land of light where there are only happy adventures. Karl does not want to be separated again from his brother, so he carries him on his back to a cliffdrop. Karl makes the jump, vowing never to be afraid again, but is cut off as they reach the bottom of the gorge. Then the narrative jump-cuts to Karl crying out jubilantly: \\"Oh, Nangilima! Yes, Jonatan, yes - I see the light! I see the light!\\" Writing process In 1946 Astrid Lindgren released the novel Mästerdetektiven Blomkvist where the knight games between the Red and the White rose is an important element. Mio, My Son, published in 1954, is another story by Lindgren which takes place in a far away medieval land. The origins of the book have been described by Lindgren several times. A train trip along the lake Fryken, south of Torsby, on a winter's day in 1972, displayed a fantastic dawn which gave her the impulse to write of a land far away. \\"It was one of those fantastic mornings with pink light over the lake - yes, it was something of unearthly beauty, and I suddenly got a strong experience, a sort of vision of the dawning light of humanity, and I felt something lit inside. This may turn into something, I thought\\". During a visit at a cemetery in Vimmerby, Lindgren was caught by an iron cross with the text Here rest the young brothers Johan Magnus and Achates Phalen, dead 1860. It gave her the inspiration to write a story with two young brothers and death: \\"Then I knew suddenly that my next book would be about death and about these two small brothers.\\" Another inspiration was when, during a press conference for the movie of Emil i Lönneberga in 1971, she saw how the young lead character actor Jan Ohlsson got in the lap of his older brother Dick.Edström, pp. 222–224 Reception The novel was favourably reviewed, but did receive some criticism, particularly on the issue of death and suicide, and supposedly recommending suicide as a solution to all problems. Many critics, though, hailed it as a major achievement, including some of those who voiced criticism pertaining to its treatment of death. :There is only one way to become free from the illness and that is for younger brother Skorpan (Karl) to take Jonatan on his back and jump from a cliff to die. In the death land of Nangilima eternal happiness reigns. [...] Of course it would be strange for me to point a finger at her (Astrid Lindgren's) imagination, but I cannot help wondering about how a handicapped child may experience Jonatan Lionheart's death wishes. Perhaps a sense of apathy would grow like a fire around the children's heart. Pondering on life-entitlement and life-quality. - Gunnel Enby in Aftonbladet December 16th, 1973. (Originally in Swedish) :But the subjectively emotional, often ecstatic tone of Karl's first-person narrative may make young readers uneasy; the book's preoccupation with death and its hints about transmigration of souls may be confusing; and the final, cool acceptance of suicide, too shocking. - Ethel L. Heins in Horn's Book Magazine, Boston, December 1975, p. 594-595. Other critics believed that Lindgren painted the tale in a very black and white world: :Would this world view, with its romantic-deterministic dream fit better in the Cold War era? Is not this beautiful tale about the fair freedom fighter against an unexplained metaphysical evil an insult to liberation movements around the world? - Kerstin Stjärne in the socialist paper Arbetet 26 October 1973 (originally in Swedish) On the other hand, readers reacted largely positive: \\"It is clear that children had a great wish for tales and preferably these kind of exciting tales. Right now I am swamped with letters from children - from several countries - that love the Brothers Lionheart. Never before have I received such a strong and spontaneous reaction on any book.\\" - Letter written by Lindgren in 1975.Edström, p. 222 The contrasts, the evocative storyline and the themes of yearning for comfort, of brotherly affection, loyalty and struggle for freedom went over well with a wide readership that was often familiar with Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and with folktales, and in many ways Lindgren's novel is an example of what Tolkien described as inspiration drawn from \\"the deeper folktale\\" (in On Fairy-Stories) and the cathartic, poignant power of such stories. Adaptations In 1977, the book was made into the Swedish fantasy film The Brothers Lionheart. The film was directed by Olle Hellbom and adapted for screenplay by Astrid Lindgren herself. Since 1985, an extended version of the film has been regularly shown on Swedish television. In 2007, the book was adapted into a musical by Bo Wastesson (music), Staffan Götestam (manuscript - coincidentally, Staffan played Jonatan in the 1977 film adaptation) and Ture Rangstrom (lyrics), directed by Elisabet Ljungar at the Gothenburg Opera House in Sweden, with the leading parts played by Hanna Brehmer (Skorpan), Alexander Lycke (Jonathan) and Annica Edstam (Sofia), orchestra conducted by Marit Strindlund, choreography created by Camilla Ekelof, costume and stage design by Mathias Clason. The musical opened on March 3, 2007. In 2009, the book was adapted into a musical by Richard Storry and Pete Gallagher. The UK Premiere of this adaptation of The Brothers Lionheart formed part of the Pleasance Theatre's Summer 2009 Programme. In 2012, it was announced that a film adaptation would be directed by Tomas Alfredson. In April 2013, the Norwegian Film Institute reported that the film's budget would be 325 million SEK, making the project the most expensive Nordic film of all time, and so requiring some foreign investors. Alfredson was expected to work together with writer John Ajvide Lindqvist and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, with whom he previously worked on the film Let the Right One In. In November 2012, it was announced that the film would be filmed in English. Shooting was at that point scheduled to begin during the summer of 2013 in Europe. Casting agent Jina Jay, previously linked to such film as The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and the Harry Potter films, announced he was looking for two boys aged eight to ten, and thirteen to fifteen, who could play the two main characters Skorpan and Jonatan, respectively. In February 2014, it was announced that the film had been postponed and that no date has been set for when the filming was to begin. According to cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, the delay was caused by \\"the financing being so complicated because there are a lot of countries involved\\".

Its main commercial hub is located at the \\"Nineways\\".Newcastle City Council, About Newcastle It is the home of the Newcastle Knights. In 2016, it had a population of approximately 1,600. Origins Broadmeadow was originally part of the Newcastle Pasturage Reserve of 648 hectares. It developed around the Great Northern Railway, the road to Newcastle's western suburbs and the construction of the Sydney to Newcastle Railway in the 1880s. Nineways is a major intersection at Broadmeadow, originally constructed as a landscaped garden in the centre of a roundabout at the intersection of nine roads/tramlines that converge there, the area was later reconstructed to have a set of traffic lights connected to only four roads. The other roads that accessed the roundabout were variously partly or fully closed off. At Nineways stood the Century Theatre, rebuilt by Hoyts Theatres after World War II, with vast foyers on two floors and seating 1600, as one of Newcastle's premier theatres for stage and screen. It was often a venue for symphony orchestra concerts after the closure of the city's Victoria Theatre, but the exodus from cinemas because of television caused its closure in the early 1970s. It was said to have sustained severe structural damage during the 1989 earthquake, and was subsequently quickly demolished, amidst great controversy. Modern history The Broadmeadow railway station is situated close by and, before the construction of the Newcastle Interchange at Wickham, was once considered as the site for Newcastle's official transport interchange following truncation of the Newcastle railway line. Between Adamstown and Broadmeadow railway stations there is a large marshaling yard that opened in 1938. Adjoining this marshalling yard was Broadmeadow Locomotive Depot which was the second largest steam locomotive depot in the state, and served the last mainline steam locomotives in service on the New South Wales Government Railways in 1973.Groves, Ken et al (1994), The 60 Class, New South Wales Rail Transport Museum The depot was then used for the stabling & servicing of Diesel locomotives until the depot was closed in 1994.\\"Remember When\\" Railway Digest February 1995 page 45 There are two high schools in Broadmeadow, Hunter School of Performing Arts (HSPA), whose students have to pass a performance trial, and Merewether High School. The latter is the only academically selective secondary school in the Newcastle region. Broadmeadow is also home to the Newcastle Regional Showground, which holds the Newcastle Regional Show and has the Newcastle Entertainment Centre, which hosts concerts and other large-scale performances. The Hunter Pirates basketball team previously played home games at the Entertainment Centre before being relocated to Singapore. The Newcastle Jets and Newcastle Knights play at the Newcastle International Sports Centre. District Park within Broadmeadow has been the base of the Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service since 1973. Broadmeadow Shopping Centre (formerly known as Newcastle Central) has a Ritchies Supa IGA and is complemented by ten speciality shops, including a Subway, IceBox Liquor, Singos Wholesale Meats, a pharmacy, a bakery and a PETQuarters pet superstore. Broadmeadow is home to several small businesses, including Hunter 294 for functions and celebrations, Rapid Solutions Building and Pest Insurance, Wellfit Personal Training, Dix Gardner, a private building certification company, and Little Black Pony Espresso. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 1,592 people in Broadmeadow. 83.1% of people were born in Australia and 83.9% of people spoke only English at home.

It is native to nearly all of North America, from northern Canada to southern Mexico. It is a rhizomatous perennial herb producing a hollow erect stem to a maximum height between . The long leaves are made up of several lance-shaped, pointed, serrated leaflets. Each shiny green leaflet is long and the entire leaf may be up to long. The inflorescence of white flowers is similar in appearance to other species in the carrot family. It is a compound umbel with many clusters of flowers. The dry tan-brown fruit is a few millimeters long. Toxicity The plant is occasionally mistaken for parsnips, due to its clusters of white tuberous roots; this is an often fatal error, as the Cicuta is extremely poisonous. It is considered to be North America's most toxic plant.'Do not eat, touch, or even inhale the air around the Machineel Tree' (Atlas Obscura) Accessed 14 August 2019 Cicuta is fatal when swallowed, causing violent and painful convulsions. Though a number of people have died from water hemlock poisoning over the centuries, livestock have long been the worst affected (hence the name \\"cowbane\\"), causing death in as little as 15 minutes.USDA Plants Profile The chief poison is cicutoxin, an unsaturated aliphatic alcohol that is most concentrated in the roots. Upon human consumption, nausea, vomiting, and tremors occur within 30–60 minutes, followed by severe cramps, projectile vomiting, and convulsions.

Located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the school delivers an enriched curriculum from Kindergarten through Grade 12. Elizabeth II, as Queen of Canada, is the royal patron of the school. The school offers a boarding option starting in grade 8. History The school was founded in 1820 by Rev. John West as the Red River Mission School for the children of early Selkirk settlers and select aboriginal children.Manitoba Historical Society. \\"St. John's Ravenscourt School\\". http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/organization/sjr.shtml The School was originally built on the banks of the Red River in Selkirk, and then relocated by Rev. David Thomas Jones to the west bank of the river near present-day St. John's Park. In 1834, the School recorded 20 boys and 21 girls attending the renamed Red River Academy. The Academy was purchased in 1849 by the Bishop of Rupertsland, David Anderson, and was renamed St. John's Collegiate.Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online. \\"Anderson, David\\". http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?BioId=39461 In 1866, the school's name was changed to St. John's College School. The school's campus was expanded to include buildings on Main Street and Anderson Avenue, and stood as a landmark until their demolition in the early 1950s. In 1929, Norman Young became the first headmaster of Ravenscourt. Young had been encouraged by a group of Winnipeg businessmen, who promised that their sons would attend. The school was originally located at Armstrong's Point on the Assiniboine River.Manitoba Historical Society. \\"A Walking Tour of Armstrong's Point\\". http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/05/armstrongpttour.shtml In 1934, it was relocated to a house built by Colonel R.M.

The new facility was soon expanded to include the Richardson Gymnasium, the first gym in Western Canada to sport a basketball court. In 1950, the Board of Anglican churchmen that as a group governed St. John's College decided to close the school. This decision upset the alumni of the school, and the alumni sought a way to continue their school. It was finally decided that St. John's College School would be amalgamated with Ravenscourt. The two schools became St. John's-Ravenscourt. After the flood of 1950, many new facilities were added to the school, notably an arena, and a junior school building. In 1971, the school made the decision to readmit girls to the school.Thomson, A. \\"Secondary Education in Manitoba in 1994\\". https://zone.biblio.laurentian.ca/dspace/bitstream/10219/187/5/Manitoba.pdf In November 1981, Her Majesty the Queen granted her patronage to the School, and one year later gave permission for the creation of scholarship in her name to mark the event of her patronage. In 2004, Kindergarten Classes and the Music Room were created for the junior school, and girls were allowed into Junior School. From 2008 through 2017, St. John's-Ravenscourt School was named one of Manitoba's Top Employers, announced by the Winnipeg Free Press newspaper. Today, the school's student population has increased to just over 800 students, with full integration of girls in all grades since 2007. In 2014, the new Richardson Senior School and Riley Fitness Centre were opened. The renovation project was done by Bockstael Construction in association with Stantec Architects. Campus St. John's-Ravenscourt School has a large, well designed campus with several different buildings serving multiple or specific purposes. The school campus is located on the bank of the Red River in Fort Garry at 400 South Drive. The school features an olympic sized arena, multiple playing fields, two separate gyms, a music wing with several different music rooms, offices, boarding facilities, a cafeteria, and numerous classrooms and laboratories. The school is divided into three main wings. Each wing has its own faculty, including a principal. Junior School - The Junior School Wing consists of several buildings, the largest being the Kiddell Building. The Junior School wing includes a distinct Kindergarten education facility, several classrooms, a gym, and a computer lab. In addition to this, the Junior School contains an atrium adjacent to the Junior School office, as well as its own library and music room. Middle School - The Middle School's facilities contain an art studio and the school's only theatre, the Moffat-Richardson Theatre. It also contains a media room with a Green Screen, a common room for the students' use, several science labs and multipurpose rooms, and the Middle School Office. The middle school wing is a building built in 1997. It is located behind the new senior school. Richardson Senior School - The Senior School Wing is the newest and largest wing of the school, with a renovation project finished in 2014, updating many of the Senior School's facilities. The wing encompasses many separate buildings, now connected, including: the Camsell Science Wing, the Tom Bredin Athletic Building, Reimer Gymnasium, and the entrance hall of the school. The Athletics building includes one of the few international-sized hockey arenas in Manitoba, the Dutton Memorial Arena. The Senior School also includes the school's cafeteria, Hamber Hall. In addition, the wing contains several music rooms, shared by the whole school. Boarding - There are boarding facilities spread out through the campus, with a boarder's lounge near the music rooms, a historic building used for girls boarding called Thomson House, and a boys boarding wing over top of the food services offices. Faculty There are approximately 150 faculty members listed on the St. John's-Ravenscourt website. Some teachers teach in both Senior and Middle School, but most teach only on one level. There are also many support staff, such as administrators, advancement and alumni relations, archives, communication and marketing, uniform shop, admissions, student records, facilities, food services, finance, student services, residence staff and IT technicians.

As SJR is a university prep school, the students must achieve a 65% average or better starting in grade 6 in order to be promoted to the next grade up. Many academic scholarships are offered, and some of the scholarship money goes to paying for the tuition of the school. Amenities and services There is a new fitness center with cardio machines and weightlifting machines. A hot lunch is provided every day for students and staff. Busing for students provided by Beaver Bus Lines takes students to school and home every day. Many clubs and extracurricular activities such as chess, math, writing, debating, Ultimate frisbee, soccer and more are available for students.

Spach includes photos, drawings, European distribution map The plant grows in damp places and shallow water. Cultivated varieties are eaten in East Asia for their pungent flavor. Description Stem of Persicaria hydropiper, showing sheathed 'nodes' at base of leaves Water pepper is an annual herb with an erect stem growing to a height of . The leaves are alternate and almost stalkless. The leaf blades are narrowly ovate and have entire margins fringed by very short hairs. They are tapering with a blunt apex. Each leaf base has stipules which are fused into a stem-enclosing sheath that is loose and fringed at the upper end. The inflorescence is a nodding spike. The perianth of each tiny flower consists of four or five segments, united near its green base and white or pink at the edges. There are six stamens, three fused carpels and three styles. The fruit is a dark brown oval, flattened nut. Biochemistry Water pepper has several active ingredients. Two bicyclic sesquiterpenoids are present, polygodial (tadeonal, an unsaturated dialdehyde with a drimane backbone), and warburganal, which gives it its pungent taste. The plant also contains rutin, a source of the bitter taste impression. Water pepper contains an essential oil (0.5%) which consists of monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids: α-pinene, β-pinene, 1,4-cineol, fenchone, α-humulene, β-caryophyllene, trans- β-bergamotene. Carboxylic acids (cinnamic, valeric and caproic acid) and their esters were present in traces. The composition depends strongly on genetic factors. Wild water pepper produces oils that cause skin irritation.Flora of North America  Uses  Water pepper is eaten in Japan, where it is known as tade (蓼), or more specifically, yanagi tade (柳蓼). The leaves are used as a vegetable, but only from the cultivar, not the wild type which has a far more pungent taste. The herb is usually sold in markets as seedlings. Young red sprouts are known as beni-tade (紅蓼), and are used to garnish sashimi, tempura, and sushi. It is popular for summer cooking. The seeds may also be added to wasabi. Water pepper sauce, known as tade-zu (蓼酢), is a sauce traditionally made from finely chopped water pepper leaves, soaked in vinegar, and a small amount of steamed rice. Occasionally, the juice from a squeezed kabosu is added. In Japanese cuisine it is traditionally used as a complement to grilled freshwater fish, but not saltwater fish. In China, water pepper is known as la liao (辣蓼), and used in traditional Chinese medicine. In Europe, water pepper was once cultivated and eaten during war time as a substitute for pepper. The plant contains many acids, including formic acid, which makes it unpalatable to livestock.Illinois Wildflowers Though animals do not eat wild water pepper, some insects do, giving rise to the Japanese saying \\"Tade kuu mushi mo sukizuki\\" (蓼食う虫も好き好き \\"Some insects eat water pepper and like it\\"), which may be translated as “There is no accounting for taste” or “Some prefer nettles.”  Gallery  Polygonum hydropiper1.jpg Persicaria hydropiper.JPG Polygonum hydropiper3.jpg Polygonum hydropiper2.jpg Polygonum hydropiper — Flora Batava — Volume v6.jpgIllustration from Jan Kops' Flora Batava (1832) Polygonum hydropiper (1832).jpgIllustration from La flore et la pomone françaises (1832) 356 Polygonum tomentosum, Polygonum hydropiper.jpgIllustration from Bilder ur Nordens Flora (1917-1926) ReferencesExternal links * Jepson Manual Treatment, University of California * Australian Plant Name Index (APNI) hydropiper Category:Spices Category:Flora of Europe Category:Flora of Australia Category:Flora of Asia Category:Flora of North America Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Persicaria hydropiper"},{"id":"2723219","text":"Prizes is a 1995 novel written by Erich Segal.http://www.erichsegal.com/novels/prizes/ It tells stories of three principal characters: Adam Coopersmith (a genius immunologist), Sandy Raven (a cell biologist bitter from betrayal), and Isabel Da Costa (a child prodigy who goes on to win a Nobel Prize in Physics).http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Segal-Delivers-a-Booby- Prize-3039188.php Plot The novel deals with the relationships of three principal characters. Adam Coopersmith, an obstetrician and immunologist, saves the life of his mentor, Dr. Max Rudolph. Although normally an ethical researcher, Coppersmith decides to test a life-saving cancer treatment on a man, against the wishes of the Food and Drug Administration. This man is Thomas Hartnell, an advisor to the President of the United States. While acting as the attending doctor, Adam meets Hartnell's daughter, Antonia, and falls in love. Antonia works as the Assistant Attorney General of the United States. Later, when Adam's mentor, Max, dies, he takes solace in Antonia's arms. They get married and have a daughter of their own, Heather. Though their relationship starts off well, things slowing begin to change. As both Adam and his daughter grow older, they realize that Antonia's top priority is her job. As Adam and Antonia slowly fall apart, he is drawn to another woman, Anya Avilov, the childless and abandoned wife of a Russian émigré. Her husband, Dr. Dmitri Avilov, abandoned her when he realized she was incapable of conceiving a child. Adam jumps at the chance to fill the void that is present in both he and Anya's hearts. Adam soon divorces Antonia and marries Anya. Although Antonia wins custody of Heather, Heather always remains more attached to Adam. Just when Adam's life seems to be on an upswing, he is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Adam also learns during this time that he has won the Nobel Prize, but unable to bear the crushing burden of his fate, Adam commits suicide. Sandy Raven is the son of Sidney Raven, a Hollywood producer. Sandy has an inferiority complex about his looks. This gets reinforced over time as he experiences a conspicuous lack of social interactions throughout his teenage years. His one teenage love, Rochelle Taubman, uses him in order to get to his father. She believes this will help her gain entry into Hollywood. When she does gain contacts in Hollywood, she very conveniently forgets Sandy. Ultimately, Rochelle does seedy bit parts, and ends up on the centerspread of Playboy. Sandy is unable to get over this betrayal and becomes socially repressed and desperate for female company. He enrolls at MIT to study Genetics, where Sandy falls in love with Judy, the daughter of his mentor and laboratory director, Gregory Morgenstern, and get married. Later, Dr. Morgenstern cheats him out of a Nobel Prize, by not mentioning Sandy's contribution on a project. This betrayal eventually leads to Judy and Sandy's divorce. Sandy finds solace in the love of his daughter Olivia. Sandy later finds new love with a Japanese woman, Kimiko, and he goes on to become a well- known geneticist. His daughter, Olivia, grows up to study physics under the tutelage of Dr. Isabel Da Costa. Isabel Da Costa is the daughter of Raymond Da Costa. She is a genius with an IQ far above average. Her father, Raymond, recognizes this early in her childhood and runs her life with an iron hand. His marriage with Isabel's mother, Muriel, suffers as a consequence of his controlling behavior. Isabel's brother, Peter, is very close to her and thinks that Raymond is ruining Isabel's youth. Muriel wants Isabel to have a normal life, and Raymond becomes stubbornly intent on forcing Isabel to work to win a Nobel prize in physics; he does this in order to vindicate his own failed academic career. Isabel is denied all pleasures of a normal teenage life with a punishing schedule in academics. She becomes a post graduate student at Berkeley before she is eighteen years old. She possesses extraordinary powers of comprehension. During her graduate career, Isabel falls in love with Jerry Pracht, the son of her thesis advisor, Karl Pracht. This happens in spite of her father's repeated efforts to keep them apart. Jerry is a genius himself, who left the pressure of academics to become an ace tennis player. Isabel longs to rebel against the pressures of being considered a genius and seeks out this relationship discreetly. Eventually, Isabel's father realizes that his hold on her life is detrimental, and gracefully eases his grasp. Eventually Isabel goes on to win the Nobel Prize in physics and fully commits to her relationship with Jerry.

They occupy a position somewhere between that of an ordinary lay follower and an ordained monastic and similar to that of the sāmaṇerī. It is still illegal for women to take full ordination as a bhikkhuni (nun) in Thailand because of a 1928 law created by the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand.\\"ประกาศห้ามพระเณรไม่ให้บวชหญิงเป็นบรรพชิต ลงวันที่ ๑๘ มิถุนายน ๒๔๗๑.\\" (ม.ป.ป.). [ออนไลน์]. เข้าถึงได้จาก: <ลิงก์ >. (เข้าถึงเมื่อ: ๒๓ พฤศจิกายน ๒๕๕๔). He based this on the fact that Gautama Buddha allowed senior bhikkhunis to initiate new women into the order. Citing the belief that the Theravada bhikkhuni sangha had died out centuries earlier and the Buddha's rules regarding bhikkhunī ordinations according to the Vinaya, the patriarch commanded that any Thai bhikkhu who ordained a female \\"is said to conduct what the Buddha has not prescribed, to revoke what the Buddha has laid down, and to be an enemy of the holy Religion...\\".See The Announcement Prohibiting Monks and Novices from Ordaining Females, dated June 18, 1928 on Thai Wikisource. The most recent case brought to the Supreme Court of Thailand is that of Phothirak, a former monk who has been ejected from the Thai sangha after being convicted of breaching the vinaya repeatedly. Phothirak then created his own sect of Buddhism, Santi Asoke, and ordained about 80 bhikkhunis in 1998, leading to his imprisonment for 66 months on several successive counts of \\"causing schism amongst the religion\\".Public Prosecutor v. Loetkhuphinit et al. Maechis have traditionally been and still are marginalized figures in Thai society. During the 20th century, new movements to improve the lot of maechis emerged. But the situation is still far from being acceptable under modern standards of human rights, with other Thai women often the most vocally opposed to women wearing robes. The Thai bhikkhuni order has been revived by Dhammananda Bhikkhuni,Bhikkhuni DhammanandaThai Bhikkhunis – Songdhammakalyani monastery who took ordination in a reestablished bhikkhuni lineage in Sri Lanka without being imprisoned as a result. But opposition from high-ranking Thai monks seems to have discouraged maechis from joining her.The Structural Violence Against Women. Nakhonpathom 2005. Since 1971 there has been a Queen's Foundation for Thai Maechi, addressing maechi affairs.  Overview  Because of the belief that the bhikkhuni order was never established in Thailand, women have traditionally been denied the chance to become ordained members of the sangha. Instead, for several centuries Thai women have chosen to live as maechis, taking the eight precepts and living either in monasteries or in dedicated communities of female renunciants. Temporary maechis, who typically do not shave their heads, are called chi phram (; ). Like bhikkhus, maechis shave their heads and undertake precepts not generally observed by lay followers. Maechis most commonly receive these precepts from a monk, but there is little in the way of a formal ordination ceremony. Maechis wear white robes in their daily lives, distinguishing them from both monks and other lay people. Maechi are not recognized as monastics by the Thai government and are not eligible for monastic benefits, but they are denied the rights of other lay citizens. While the officially recognized (male) sangha has traditionally received considerable oversight and assistance from various government ministries, only in the 20th century did the Thai Sangha begin to take an organized role in providing for the needs of maechis. An institute now attempts to roughly track the number of maechis in the country, and provides funds that can be used for educational opportunities for maechis. The amount per person spent by the government on supporting maechis, is significantly less than the amount spent on monks. Likewise, maechis do not receive certain perks (such as free passage on public transportation) that are offered to monks. Yet, maechis, like monks, are forbidden from voting or standing for civil elections in Thailand. Maechis have traditionally not enjoyed the same level of support given to monks by the Thai laity. Because the maechis have no special position described in the Tipiṭaka or Pāli Canon, they are seen as laywomen and gifts given to maechis are not seen as bringing merit to the donor in the same manner that gifts given to a monk would. Most Thais are unfamiliar with the history of the Theravada bhikkhuni sangha and believe that Gautama Buddha never ordained women. Others believe that women become maechis because they can't find a husband or to escape personal and family problems. Most maechis live on temple grounds. The temple may provide daily meals and lodging but, in general, maechis are expected to provide for themselves through support from relatives and temples do not care for them as they do male monastics. Most maechis essentially act as servants or staff for the temple, cooking and cleaning for monks and overseeing the sale of incense and other offerings to visitors to the temple. Smaller numbers of maechis live in their own communities, which may or may not be associated with a local monastery. Women in these communities often experience better conditions than those living in traditional monasteries. The separation of the male and female renunciants helps discourage the maechis being used as servants by monks and temple staff.  History  The exact derivation of the term maechi is not known. Several possible etymologies have been suggested, relating maechi either to Sanskrit or Sinhalese terms for renunciants, morality, or other positive qualities. The word chi is occasionally used in the Thai language to refer either to Buddhist monks, or to ordained followers of other traditions, such as Hindu priests or Jain monastics. Historically, little is known about the status and lives of maechis prior to Western contact with the kingdoms that preceded the modern state of Thailand. European observers in the 17th century reported seeing white-robed, shaven-headed women who lived on the grounds of Buddhist temples. Most of these women were reported to be advanced in years, possibly indicating that life as a maechi may have served as a sort of retirement plan for older women who did not have families to provide for them. Records from prior to this time do not explicitly mention maechis in Thailand; it is likely that some records were lost in the destruction of the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the 18th century. The marginalization of the maechis in Thai society may also play a role in their exclusion from the historical record. In 1969, the first nationwide meeting of maechis was organized by the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand.noted in the cover article of Vipassana Banteurng Sarn Vol.2 Issue 4. April 1969 During the same year, the Queen's Foundation for Thai Maechi was formed to organize maechis scattered throughout Thailand. The institute seeks to improve conditions for maechis by providing better access to education, and screening and placing potential maechis and seeks to ensure that all maechis possess basic knowledge of Buddhist teachings and proper monastic behavior. The institute has also attempted to discourage maechi from begging for alms as monks do. Instead, older maechis (who are particularly at risk for poverty) are increasingly placed in old-age homes.  Other female Buddhist orders in Thailand  Despite the absence of a full bhikkhuni ordination in Thailand, a number of other groups of female renunciants emerged in Thai society during the 20th Century. The buddhasavikas are a very small organization of women who have received ordination from Taiwanese Buddhist lineages such as Fo Guang Shan. The sikhamats were female renunciants ordained by the Santi Asoke movement. They lived a communal life, kept a strict vegetarian diet, and attempted to be self-supporting through organic farming and daily manual labor.

It is one of the many species of Hoya that are native to Eastern Asia and Australia. It is a common house plant grown for its attractive waxy foliage, and sweetly scented flowers. It is grown well in pots and hanging baskets. Hoya carnosa has been in cultivation for more than 200 years and has given rise to many cultivars that vary in foliage form or flower color. In cultivation in the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit. Description Hoya carnosa makes faintly succulent shoots with smooth, pale gray, and bare surfaces that writhe and climb. The shoots are soft at first, but lignified later. The perennial leaves are stalked with about 1 to 1.5 cm long stems. The blade is wide oval to longitudinal oval or heart-shaped. The leaves are slightly succulent, fleshy with a waxy glossy surface. The stem is up to about 10 cm long. The leaves, ovate or elliptical, are 3-5 cm wide and 3.5-13 cm long, with a petiole of about 1-1.5 cm. The intersteaminal side lobes are pointed oval to lanceolate, the top is convex. The outer end is white, the inner end dyed red. The spindle-shaped fruits measure 6 to 10 × 0.5 to 1.5 cm.Focke Albers, Ulli Meve (ed.): Succulent Encyclopedia. Asclepiadaceae (milkweed plants) . Eugen Ulmer, Stuttgart 2002, , p 150 =Flowers= Hoya carnosa flower The inflorescence is made up of numerous flowers, hanging or more upright, which are grouped in an umbel. The flowers are typically light pink, but may vary from near-white to dark pink; they are star-shaped, and are borne in clusters that look like tiny wax miniatures. The surface of the flowers is covered in tiny hairs giving them a fuzzy sheen. They are heavily scented and may produce excess nectar that drips from the flowers. The flower crown has a diameter of 1.5 to 2 cm and is whitish to slightly pink coloured. Like all species of Hoya, H. carnosa flowers from specialised perennial structures referred to as spurs. These appear from the axils of the leaves and stem; flowers may not be produced when the spurs first appear, but in time buds emerge from the tips. Each season new flowers are produced on these same spurs, so they should not be damaged or removed. The plant flowers from spring to late summer, it can produce umbels of 10 to 50 small star-shaped flowers that mature gradually (2 to 3 weeks) on the same peduncle. The scent is nocturnal with a pheromonal tendency. Range This species is found in Queensland, East India, in southern China (Fujian, Guangdong and Yunnan provinces, and Guangxi autonomous region), Taiwan, Myanmar, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Japanese islands of Kyushu and Ryukyu, where it grows in humid subtropical forests, and the Fiji Islands.  Cultivation  This Hoya species prefers bright light, but will tolerate much less. Though it will tolerate low temperatures (but not freezing), the optimal temperature is . It can be propagated by air layering or by stem cuttings. It benefits from an open potting medium that allows some air to get to the roots. Typical mixes include large-grade drainage material such as perlite, pumice, or ceramic balls. The plants should be fed regularly with a fertilizer suitable for epiphytic plants. There is a persistent piece of folklore that hoyas prefer to be potbound - kept in a small pot. It is said that this will hasten flowering. Studies at the University of Georgia, published in 2009, have shown H. carnosa to be an excellent remover of pollutants in the indoor environment.

Other types of handmade noodles include youmian (similar dough texture and taste, but thinner round noodles), or mee hoon kueh (flat and thin rectangular pieces). The name banmian (board/block noodle) came from the Hakka method of cutting the noodle into straight strands using a wooden block as ruler. In Hakka, some might call it Man-Foon-Char-Guo () or Dao-Ma-Chet (). In Hokkien, it was called Mee-Hoon-Kueh (麵粉粿; lit. \\"wheat snack\\") but what can be found at hawker stalls is generally called banmian. The current style is a mix between the traditional methods of Hakka and Hokkien. The Hakka initially made the noodle by shaving pieces off a block of dough, commonly made from flour (sometimes egg is added for more flavor), while the Hokkien would roll the dough into a large, flat piece that would then be torn by hand into bite-sized bits. Traditionally, the dough is hand- kneaded and torn into smaller pieces of dough (about 2 inches). The dough can also be kneaded using machine into a variety of shapes, the most common shape being flat strips of noodle. Banmian is a culinary dish that is popular in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan. It consists of egg noodles served in a flavorful soup, often with some type of meat or fish, vegetables and various spices. Dried anchovies, minced pork, mushrooms, and a leafy vegetable such as sweet potato leaves or sayur manis (sauropus androgynus) are also possible ingredients. . The meal is considered one of the healthier food choices and can be found for sale by restaurants, street vendors and food stalls in the region. The base of the entire meal is the soup, so there are numerous variations in ingredients, stocks and noodle shapes. In many instances, the completed soup is topped with an egg that is cooked in the hot liquid above the noodles. Traditional versions of banmian use egg noodles that are simply a blend of egg, flour, water and salt that is kneaded and then formed into noodles. However, the modern day banmian is mainly made by using a pasta maker which cuts noodles in all sizes. The base of the soup can be water but is more commonly a type of fish stock. Normal fish stock can be used, but anchovy stock is a common choice. Various ingredients, such as onions, garlic, ginger and bean paste, also can be added to the stock to provide more flavor, although some preparations are so simple that nothing more than plain stock is used. In Malaysia, dry noodles and soup are served separately. Dry chilli pan mee is a variant which was invented in Chow Kit, Kuala Lumpur,https://funntaste.com/dry-chilli-pan-mee-restoran-kin-kin/ and is very popular in the Klang Valley.https://www.lifestyleasia.com/kl/food- drink/dining/here-is-where-you-can-find-the-best-chilli-pan-mee-in-kl/ This dry noodle is served with minced pork, fried onions, anchovies, and topped with a poached egg which is later to be stirred into the noodles. It is usually served with dry chilli or sambal. Two common ingredients that are often found across different versions of banmian are mushrooms and anchovies. The exact type of each might vary, but they are generally added to the stock base. The mushrooms can be dried and are reconstituted in the broth, while the anchovies could be fried until crispy and then served on top of the soup. The anchovies also can be added to the stock for flavor and allowed to break down as it cooks. Once the base stock is completed, nearly anything can be added to complete the banmian. This includes vegetables such as green onions, spinach, cabbage and bamboo shoots. Some vinegar is usually added, occasionally with sugar to balance the flavor. Restaurants may offer minced pork that has been fried or chunks of white fish to act as a protein-rich addition to the soup. Finally, an egg is cracked into the hot broth and allowed to cook until the whites are set and the yolk is warmed through.

Taxonomy and phylogeny The species was originally named by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 ' as Papaver cambricum. In 1814, Louis Viguier separated it from Papaver, making it the type species of his new genus Meconopsis. One of the reasons was the presence of a style: other species in the genus Papaver have unstalked stigmas, arranged in a disc shape, whereas P. cambricum has stigmatic surfaces at the end of a distinct style. Later, many newly discovered species from the Himalayas and adjacent regions of China were added to the genus. As Meconopsis cambricum, it was the only species in the genus native to Europe. However, a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2011 showed that P. cambricum is not related to Meconopsis species, but is instead nested within Papaver, suggesting that Linnaeus' original name should be restored. However, this would have left the genus Meconopsis without a type species and hence without a valid name, unless the name were to be conserved. A proposal to retain Meconopsis for the Asian species was accepted in 2017, with the conserved type Meconopsis regia G.Taylor. The genus transfer is accepted by many sources. Distribution and habitat Papaver cambricum is endemic to upland areas of Western Europe; it is found natively in the mountains of the Iberian Peninsula, the Pyrenees, the Massif Central and some western parts of the British Isles (Wales, south-western England and parts of Ireland). It has, however, been widely naturalised outside its native range. Papaver cambricum lives in damp, shady places on rocky ground. In its most western locations, it is increasingly found on more open ground with less cover. It is especially well adapted to colonising gaps and crevices in rocks and stones. This habit has enabled it to colonise the urban environment, growing between paving slabs and at the edges of walls. In human culture On 24 February 2006, the Welsh political party Plaid Cymru adopted a stylised image of P. cambricum as its party logo.

It was originally written and released in June 2004 as \\"Travian\\" by Gerhard Müller. Set in classical antiquity, Travian: Legends is a predominantly militaristic real-time strategy game. Travian has been translated into over 40 languages from the original German version, and at one time boasted over 5 million players on over 300 game servers worldwide. In 2006, it won the Superbrowsergame Award, in the large games category. Travian: Legends is programmed in PHP and runs in most modern browsers. Its creators may have drawn from an earlier German board game, The Settlers of Catan, for layout and the resource development theme.  Gameplay  Travian: Legends is set in classical antiquity. Each player starts the game as the leader of a small, undeveloped village, surrounded by undeveloped resource fields. Developing these fields increases their resource output. The village can be developed by constructing new buildings and upgrading existing ones. Recruiting military units allows players to attack other villages to plunder resources, and defend from enemy attacks. Villages may trade their resources with other villages if both villages have a marketplace. The player may expand their realm by founding new villages, or by conquering other players' villages. Players can communicate with each other using in-game messages, and may join alliances for military and economic co-operation with other players. = Starting a game = Players must register on the Travian website to join a game, providing an e-mail address, and creating a username and a password. The player must also choose a tribe to play the game with, and select a World, that represents a game server, to play in. Entities in one World can only interact with other entities in the same World. Events that take place in one World do not affect other Worlds. Players may operate accounts in multiple Worlds, but operating more than one account in the same World is prohibited by the rules. However, multiple players may operate a single account. Worlds close registrations for new players after a certain number of players have signed up. After logging in, the player can follow a tutorial that guides them through various aspects of the game and offers rewards for successful completion. At the start of the game, there is a \\"beginner's protection\\" period, in which the player cannot be attacked, the length of which depends on the server. = Tribes = There are 3 playable tribes and two non-playable tribes on classic Travian: Legend servers. Two additional tribes are also available on special servers, currently called \\"Fire and Sand\\". These tribes are the Huns and Egyptian. The original playable tribes are the Romans, the Gauls, and the Teutons. The player selects one of these tribes during registration. Each tribe has different specialities. Romans can upgrade buildings and resource fields simultaneously, have powerful troops which are expensive to train, and have low-capacity merchants. Gauls have fast-moving troops with good defensive capabilities, and fast merchants. Teutons are geared towards an aggressive style of play, and offer weak but cheap troops, as well as slow but high-capacity merchants. Once a tribe is chosen it cannot be changed, and all villages founded or conquered by the player will be of that tribe. The two NPC tribes are the Natars and Nature. Natarian villages randomly spawn all over the map, and will gradually develop. Villages of players who have deleted their accounts will also have a chance of turning into Natarian villages. These villages can be attacked and conquered by players. Natars also occupy the central area of the map, and will attack players' villages in that area. Natarian villages may hold ancient artefacts which give bonuses to those who possess them. Nature is the tribe to which animals occupying abandoned oases on the map belong. Unlike the other four tribes, Natural troops cannot attack other villages but may be attacked. It is possible to capture animals from oases and use them as defensive units. = Resources = Developing villages and training units consume resources. Resources are produced by the resource fields that surround each settlement; their output can be increased by upgrading the fields and by capturing nearby oases. There are four kinds of resources in Travian: wood, clay, iron and crop. Each resource is required to develop a village, with clay being the most demanded used resource for construction. Additionally, consumption of resources will vary based on the player's tribe: Roman troops require iron for their armour, Teutonic troops require wood, and Gallic troops require clay. Military units and the village population consume crop, so the net crop production is lowered whenever the population grows or a new military unit joins the village. Troops can raid other villages to plunder resources. Resources can also be transferred to other villages unilaterally if the source village has a marketplace. Bilateral trade can take place when both villages have a marketplace, and one village accepts a trading deal offered by another. = Buildings = Buildings can be built and upgraded in the 22 building slots in the village centre. They cost time and resources to construct, and attract more people to settle in the village, increasing the population. Buildings may have a prerequisite that one or more of the other buildings must be at a certain level. Each type of building has a different use. New villages start with the main building, which decreases the construction time of new extensions to the buildings and resource fields in the village. Warehouses and granaries allow the village to store more resources. Military units are trained at the barracks, stable, workshop, residence and palace, while military research is conducted at the academy and the armoury. There are also buildings that enhance the resource production in the village. A treasure chamber allows the village to hold an artefact, and shows the list of the locations of all the artefacts in the game. = Villages = A developed village. Each player starts the game with a single undeveloped village, designated as the capital. A village consists of the village centre, and 18 resource fields that surround the village centre. Up to 22 buildings can be constructed in the village centre. Of these, two are special-purpose building spaces, for the walls and the rally point. In an undeveloped village, the resource fields are at level 0, and there is only a single building, known as the main building. Players can found or conquer additional villages to expand their realm, increase total resource production and help support larger armies. There are prerequisites for founding or conquering additional villages. The player must have accumulated enough culture points, which are passively produced by most buildings, and actively produced by hosting parties in the town hall. The number of culture points required depends on the total number of villages the player already controls. The player must also have a palace or the residence building in a village he or she controls to be at a particular level. The level requirement depends on the number of villages founded or conquered by troops from that particular village. Once these criteria are met, the player may train three settlers to go and found a new village at a chosen vacant area on the map. Settlers must be given 750 of each resource before they start their journey. When the settlers reach their destination, they will found an undeveloped village which will be under the player's control. Instead of founding a new village, a player may choose to conquer another village. The player may train an administrator (a Roman senator, a Teutonic chief or a Gallic chieftain) instead of three settlers. Unlike settlers, these units must be researched in the academy before they can be trained. Administrators can be sent to another village, usually accompanied by other troops, where they will speak to the village's populace and reduce their loyalty to the defender. If the loyalty drops to zero, the village will join the attacker's realm. The defender will lose control of the village, and all troops originating from the village will cease to exist. A capital can not be conquered. Villages are destroyed if its population drops to zero as a result of a siege. However, a village cannot be destroyed if it is a player's last village, so a player will always have at least one village. = Troops = Troops are military units that allow the player to attack and defend villages. They can carry resources, so they can be used to raid other villages. There are mainly three classifications of troop: tribe, mobility and function. There are fifty different types of troop in Travian, ten for each tribe. Troops are either infantry or cavalry. Most troop types are regular units, but each tribe has troop types to represent scouts, two types of siege engine, administrators and settlers. Each troop type has attributes which determine its training cost, upkeep, offensive capability, defensive capability against infantry and cavalry, speed and resource carrying capacity. Infantry is trained in the barracks, and cavalry is trained in the stable. Scouts are espionage units that can be used to spy on enemy villages, or defend from espionage attacks. Siege engines, which are built in the workshop, allow players to destroy enemy buildings and defensive structures. Administrators and settlers are units that have the ability to conquer or found new villages, respectively. They are trained in the residence or the palace. At first, players may only recruit the most basic troop type of their tribe. To train more advanced troops, the player must research them in the academy in the village where they are to be trained. Troops may also require military buildings to be upgraded to a certain level before they may be researched. Troops' offensive and defensive attributes may be improved by constructing an armoury to enhance their weapons and armour. Upgrading the barracks, stable and workshop allow faster training of troops. There are also buildings known as the great barracks and the great stable, which allow simultaneous training of the same troop type but at three times the cost. Roman villages can build a horse drinking trough to speed up training of cavalry and reduce their upkeep. Teutons can build a brewery which improves the offensive attributes of troops from that village. There is also a special unit known as a hero, which can gain experience from battle. Heroes can equip items, embark on adventures, capture oases and produce resources. They can also accompany an army. Depending on their attributes, a hero may give an offensive or defensive bonus to the army that it accompanies. = Items = There are two types of items in the game; the first are artefacts, which gives bonuses to the holder, depending on the type of artefact; the second are equipment and consumables for the hero. Artefacts are items which are introduced mid-game, and give significant bonuses to those who possess them. Upon release, they are placed in heavily defended Natarian villages, and can be acquired either by conquering the village, or by destroying the treasury in the target village and sending an army accompanied by the hero to capture the artefacts. All players with a treasury can see the locations of the artefacts. Based on the bonus strength and area of effect, artefacts are split into four categories: village-wide artefacts provide the bonus to the village that the artefacts are currently in; realm-level artefacts generally have a weaker bonus, but affect all the villages in the player's realm; unique artefacts also affect all the villages in the realm, but they provide bonuses that are at least as strong as that of village-wide artefacts; the fourth type of artefact provides alliance-wide effects, which are only used for the construction plans for the Wonders of the World that are released near the end of the game. Different artefacts provide bonuses to different attributes. There are nine types of artefacts; the bonuses of the first six are stronger buildings, faster troops, better spies, less hungry troops, faster troop training, and improved cranny capacity with less precision for enemy catapults. The bonus and its strength provided by the seventh type are randomised, and switch between the first six every 24 hours. The effect can also be positive or negative. The eighth artefact provides the player with the construction plans for the great warehouse and granary. The ninth provides the plans for the Wonders of the World. Equipment and consumable items affect the hero and the army that he or she accompanies. Equipment consists of armour and weapons for the hero, mounts, and special items that increase the speed or carrying capacity of the troops. Consumable items include those that regenerate the hero's health, provide experience points, reduce battle losses, increase culture points, reset the hero's attributes, and provide the means to capture animals from oases. Items are obtained during a hero's adventures, and can be traded on the silver market. = Alliances = Travian players can create and join alliances whose members support each other economically and militarily. Once in an alliance, the player can make, view and accept alliance-only resource trading offers in their village marketplaces. There are also features such as shared combat reports to support military cooperation between members. Each alliance member can view combat reports from every other member of the alliance, and there is a forum and a web chat feature for talking to other members. Alliance leaders can delegate powers to other members of the alliance, including the ability to send mass alliance-wide in- game messages, invite new players into the alliance, remove existing members of the alliance and change the alliance name and description. The maximum number of members in an alliance is 60, so when an alliance wants to expand further, it splits into multiple wings. Members in one wing cannot view the combat reports of members in another wing, benefit from alliance-only resource trading, or use the web chat to talk to each other, since the game considers the wings to be separate alliances. Travian also supports inter-alliance diplomacy. Two or more alliances may form a non-aggression pact or a military alliance pact. This is supported by features that prevent certain forms of aggression between members of the alliances in question. There is also a diplomatic feature to allow alliances to recognise a state of war. Towards the end of a game, different alliances often join together, resulting in large coalitions that fight each other to try to complete the victory conditions. There is a ranking system determines alliances' rank from attacking, defending, raiding and growth. Alliances earn medals for their profile page by ranking in the top 10 for a category. The medal will contain information about the category, the rank and when it was earned. = End game = Each round of Travian concludes with the end game sequence. For normal game rounds the sequence begins after about 200 days. After this time has elapsed, the plans for the construction of the Wonders of the World are released into Natarian villages. Coalitions of alliances work together to capture plans and construct a Wonder before rival coalitions. With every five levels that the Wonder is upgraded, the Natars attack the villages containing the Wonders until level 95, when they will then attack upon the completion of every new level. In addition to this, enemy coalitions also send attacks against the villages, sometimes timed to coincide with the Natarian attacks. The first player to build their World Wonder to level 100 is declared to be the winner of the round. The players with the most populous realm and the most successful attacking and defending streaks are also mentioned in the declaration. After the winner is declared, the game stops and players can no longer build, trade or engage in combat. After a period of time, the next round begins, and the game starts afresh.  Development  Oliver Eger, illustrator Travian was developed and published in June 2004 as a PHP hobby project by Gerhard Müller, then a student of chemistry at the Technical University of Munich. The second version was released on 12 March 2005, with new buildings and changes to the game mechanics and graphics. Critical Gamers compared the game to The Settlers of Catan and Solar Realms Elite. As a result of the unexpected success of the game, Gerhard Müller and his brother Siegfried Müller founded Travian Games as a non-trading partnership in July 2005, which was changed into a limited liability company later in the year. The operations and the rights of Travian were transferred to the company at the beginning of 2006. In 2006, Travian Games began offering access to a mobile phone-optimised interface to the game through a subscription-based Java ME midlet. The application was developed by Markus Rieger of GameCreator. However, this application is no longer developed or supported. Version 3 was released on 30 June 2006, and featured oases which could be annexed, and would supplement the player's hourly resource production, as opposed to the oases in version 2, which were only present for visual appeal. Version 3 also introduced 'heroes', military units which gain experience in battles. There were also major changes to game mechanics and graphics. Update 3.1 introduced quests that players could complete to receive rewards in the form of resource or game gold. An edition of Travian where events take place three times faster, known as Travian Speed3x, was also released. Later Speed editions with different speed multipliers were released. On March 16, 2007, an announcement was made about the release of Travian Classic, dubbed \\"Travian 2.5\\", which was based on version 3 but had certain features disabled in order to make it similar to version 2. Update 3.5 was first implemented on the original .org server (German) in early February 2009, and was implemented on other servers with the game restarting in mid-2009. It reintroduced artifacts—items which give the players bonuses once captured. On 22 October 2009, it was followed by update 3.6, which made several Plus! account-only features available to non-paying users, along with newly added features. In July 2010, an announcement was made saying that developers were working on a Version 4, which was released in February 2011.  Financing  Travian was initially financed through players upgrading accounts with Travian Plus and web banners. Later, an option for purchasing 'Gold' replaced the one for buying 'Plus' on most servers. The introduction of 'Gold' allowed players to directly influence the game mechanics: for instance, by increasing resource production, instant completion of building and researches. At one point gold could purchase attack and defense bonuses of 10%, but this has been revoked in latter servers. Accounts upgraded with Plus allowed building queues, larger maps and other functional abilities. These effects can be replicated with user scripts, but implementing these can result in a banning of the offending account as they are against the general terms and conditions of Travian. The Gold club, available since version 3.6, features attack lists and valley searches. Travian has also included a \\"Travian Shop\\" which includes Travian- related items like clothing and mugs.  Reception  Travian was ranked at second place in the medium games category of Gamesdynamite's Superbrowsergame Award in 2005, and was chosen as the Most Innovative Browser Game of 2005 by Coole Browsergames. In 2006, Travian won the Superbrowsergame Award, in the large games category, and was chosen as the Browser Game of the Year 2006 by Coole Browsergames. Christian Donlan, game reviewer, described Travian's version 2 interface as \\"ugly\\", with a \\"primitive cartoon style\\" and a bad colour scheme. He characterised the game as \\"functional rather than beautiful\\", with an interface that is \\"uncluttered\\". Travian was chosen as the Browser Game of the Year 2011 in the classic games category by GforGaming's jury.

Part of the street is a section of the A4, a major road through London. It is named after the politician Henry Coventry, secretary of state to Charles II. The street was constructed in 1681 for entertainment and retail purposes, and acquired a shady character with numerous gambling houses and a reputation for prostitution. This changed during the late 19th century, with the establishment of several music hall outlets including the London Pavilion, the Prince of Wales Theatre and the Trocadero Music Hall. In the 20th century, it became known for its high-traffic restaurants, including the first J. Lyons and Co. and the first premises of the seafood restaurant Scott's. It was also popular for its nightclubs, and was the original location of the Flamingo Club. Geography Coventry Street is one-way for motor traffic, running eastbound. It is around long and runs east from Piccadilly Circus to Leicester Square via Haymarket and Wardour Street. The nearest tube stations are Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square. The western section of the road is part of the A4 one-way system between Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square. No buses run along the full length of Coventry Street but there is access to numerous routes from Piccadilly Circus or nearby Charing Cross Road. History16th – 18th century= There is historical evidence of a road linking Haymarket with Wardour Street in 1585, roughly in the present location of Coventry Street. This pre-dated Leicester Square, and ran as far as St. Martin's Field, stopping short of St. Martin's Lane. Coventry Street was constructed in 1681 as a thoroughfare between the two places and was named after the secretary of state to Charles II, Henry Coventry. Coventry had previously built a house in this location, and renamed it Coventry House in 1670. The house was described as \\"a capital messuage with divers outhouses, Gardens, Yards. … capable of being greatly improved.\\" Coventry died in 1686 and the house was demolished four years later, to be replaced by a group of smaller houses. The land to the north of the street was partly owned by Colonel Thomas Panton, and partly by the Earl of St Albans. John Ogilby's 1681 map of London shows Coventry Street built up on both sides. The street had been designed for commercial and entertainment purposes, rather than a place of residence. For much of the 18th and early 19th century, there were a number of gambling houses along the street, contributing to a shady and downmarket character. The historian J.T.Smith remarked in 1846 that Coventry Street had \\"a considerable number of gaming-houses in the neighbourhood at the present time, so that the bad character of the place is at least two centuries old, or ever since it was built upon\\". Trocadero has been an entertainment centre on Coventry Street since 1744. The current facade dates from 1882, when it was a music hall. The Trocadero sits in the area between Coventry Street, Great Windmill Street and Shaftesbury Avenue, with the main entrance on Coventry Street. The origins of the site can be traced back to 1744, when John Cartwright gave a 99-year lease on this land to Thomas Higginson, in order to construct a real tennis court. Higginson retained ownership of the court until 1761, after which it had a number of owners through to the 19th century. From the 1820s onwards, it was used as a music and exhibition hall. After the lease expired in 1842, ownership passed to John Musgrove, who sublet it to Robert Bignel. Bignel redesigned the premises as a number of assembly rooms called the Argyll Rooms. It acquired a notorious reputation for prostitution, and consequently closed in 1878. It re-opened four years later as the Trocadero Palace, a music hall. A group of shops were established on the site in 1889, and the entire development was sold to J. Lyon's & Co in 1895. Having been part of the Lyons restaurant complex and shops for much of the 20th century, it is now a shopping centre. Wishart's tobacco makers was established on Coventry Street in 1720. The family business survived through to the following century. The goldsmiths and jewellers Lambert's were established at Nos. 10–12 Coventry Street in 1803. =19th – 21st century= Coventry Street was mostly made up of retail properties by the 19th century. In 1835, an exhibition named the \\"Parisian infernal machine\\" was set up on Coventry Street, that depicted a murderer attempting to assassinate the French royal family. During 1851, a French wizard known as Robin performed in a building on Coventry Street. Coventry Street was widened between 1877 and 1881 by reducing the frontage to properties on the southern side, as part of general traffic improvements in the area that also saw widening of Charing Cross Road and Shaftesbury Avenue. The London Pavilion was at the corner of Coventry Street with Piccadilly Circus and Shaftesbury Avenue. It was established in 1861 as an extension to the Black Horse Inn, hosting music hall events. It was demolished in 1885 and rebuilt and reopened by Edmund Villiers, becoming a theatre in 1918. It subsequently became a cinema, closing in 1982. The site is now part of the Trocadero Shopping Centre. Lyons Corner House on Coventry Street in 1942 Charles Hirsch, a bookseller, sold French literature and pornography from his shop \\"Librairie Parisienne\\" in Coventry Street in the late 19th century. Hirsch was friends with Oscar Wilde and claimed to have sold him various items of homosexual pornography. Café de Paris has been established on Coventry Street since 1924. The Prince Of Wales Theatre opened in 1884 on Coventry Street. It was built for and financed by actor-manager Edgar Bruce from profits made at the Scala Theatre. The Private Secretary, written by Charles Hawtrey, was first performed here. Throughout the 20th century it mainly performed musicals and revues, with occasional ventures into farce. The theatre was rebuilt in 1937, and again between 2003–4 at a cost of £7.5 million. It can now accommodate 1,133 patrons. Coventry Street has been a centre for high-volume food outlets. The first J. Lyons and Co. Corner House was built on Coventry Street in 1907, on the west corner with Rupert Street. It was one of the first buildings in London to have a white-glazed terracotta exterior. In 1920, the former premises of Lamberts at Nos. 10–12 were demolished in order to accommodate an extension that could accommodate up to 3,000 diners. Scott's Restaurant first operated in Coventry Street. Originally opening as an oyster warehouse in 1872 at No. 18 as part of the London Pavilion, it moved to No. 19 in 1891, expanding as a full restaurant. The restaurant moved to Mount Street in Mayfair in 1967. In 1887, the Leicester, a public house, opened at the corner of Coventry Street and Wardour Street. It closed in 1927 so the neighbouring department store could expand. In the 1920s, the street became a centre for nightclubs, attracting clientele such as Edward, Prince of Wales, Rudolph Valentino, Noël Coward, Fred Astaire and Charlie Chaplin. The Café de Paris opened in 1924 in the basement of the Rialto Cinema (which had opened in 1913) and became a popular club through the rest of the decade because of the owner Martin Poulsen's friendship with the Prince of Wales. On 8 March 1941, the Cafe and much of Coventry Street suffered significant damage from bombing as part of the Blitz, killing 84 people including Poulsen, though former Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, visiting the cafe, survived. Owing to a lack of water, a leg wound had to be washed with champagne as it was the only suitable substance to hand. The restaurant was rebuilt after the war and became a private venue in 1957. The Flamingo Club, a jazz nightclub, started on Coventry Street in 1952. It moved in 1957 to Wardour Street, where it became a popular venue for British rhythm and blues. The Swiss Centre, at the far eastern end of the street adjoining Leicester Square was constructed between 1963–66 and designed by David du R. Aberdeen and Partners. A Swiss clock was attached to the premises in 1985. The centre was demolished in 2008, with the clock moving to Leicester Square in 2011. Cultural references On 16 April 1922 a man was assaulted while walking down Coventry Street around 6.00am. He fell unconscious after the attack, and was rushed to Charing Cross Hospital, where he was found to have been stabbed in the neck by a thin tube. After another man was attacked a few hours later in a similar manner, followed by a third victim in the evening, an urban legend spread that a vampire was stalking Coventry Street. No further incidents occurred and the attacker was never convicted. Coventry Street is one of the yellow property squares on the British Monopoly board. The other squares are Leicester Square and Piccadilly, both of which connect to it. All three streets share a common theme of entertainment and nightlife.

It replaced the highly successful Schempp-Hirth Ventus. Design and development The Ventus-2a and 2b are 15 metre sailplanes. The 'a' version has a narrow fuselage and the wider fuselage version is called the 2b. Winglets are used with these models. The 18 metre span Ventus-2c was introduced in 1995 and was almost an entirely different aircraft with a different fuselage and wings, but it has the option of shorter tips with winglets to fly as a 15-metre sailplane. From 2003 the Schempp-Hirth Discus-2 fuselage was used for all versions, which now have the designations 2ax, 2bx and 2cx. Flight tests in 1996 showed that the 15 metre version had a glide angle of 46:1 but only after considerable work on sealing gaps and by using turbulators. The narrow fuselage Ventus-2a has been highly successful in competitions with consecutive World Championship wins from 1995 to 2003. A narrow fuselage version with an 18-metre span, the Ventus 2cxa has also been built. Some Ventus-2c and 2cx are fitted with small Solo 2350 sustaining engines (turbos) and are designated with a T suffix, while some are self- launching with a more powerful Solo 2625 and have the suffix 'M'. The 2cT climbs at up to 0.9 m/s (177 ft/min) and the 2cM at over 3 m/s (590 ft/min). Ranges for the powered versions in saw-tooth operation are and respectively. The 2cxa has been designed to take a jet engine. A small number of Ventus 2 were fitted with the front electric sustainer. Production of the 2a and 2b has reached 168 aircraft, while the 2c, 2cT, and 2CM have reached 459. A replacement model, the Ventus 3, first flew on 29 January 2016 and serial production started in April 2016.

Matå'pang (died 1680) was a Chamorro maga'låhi or chief of the ancient Chamorro village of Tomhom on the island of Guahan. His name meant \\"to be made pure by cleansing,\\" in Chamorro. Matå'pang is best known for resisting the Spanish invasion of his country and for his conflict with a Spanish priest Diego de San Vitores, an early missionary of the colonial Spanish empire on Guam, and his Filipino associate, Pedro Calungsod, resulting in the deaths of the foreigners at the hands of Matå'pang and his companion Hurao. Today Matå'pang has become iconic among many activists for Chamorro self- determination.  Biography  Early in his life, Matå'pang converted to Christianity, but later renounced the faith after seeing the Spaniards use it to suppress Chamorro culture. However, in an attempt to draw Matå'pang back to the church, Diego de San Vitores covertly baptized Matå'pang's infant daughter in 1672. This action infuriated Matå'pang, not just because of the baptism but also because it violated a taboo against entering a chief's home; after learning of his daughter's baptism, Matå'pang immediately tracked down and killed San Vitores. The death of San Vitores caused the Christianizing mission on Guam to deteriorate into open conflict, and Matå'pang began acting as a key military leader among the Chamorro. However, he was eventually injured in battle, and retreated to the nearby island of Rota to recuperate. A Spanish fleet was subsequently sent to Rota to track down Matå'pang, and fearing that they would draw the Spaniards' ire, the island's population turned on him. The people of Rota attacked Matå'pang and cast him out on a boat; Matå'pang would succumb to his injuries while sailing back to Guam. Cultural references Matå'pang today has been reclaimed as a celebrated figure by many in the younger generation of Chamorro activists, who view him as a moving figure of resistance against imperial domination and cultural erasure. Jay Baza Pascua's spoken-word poem \\"A Descendant of Matå'pang\\" is a good example of this movement to rehabilitate Matå'pang as a Chamorro icon. In that poem, Pascua states: > \\"You see, Father Luis de San Vitores was determined to bring God to the > “Indios” of the Pacific. \\"Determined enough he disobeyed Matåpang’s order > not to baptize his ailing child ... Matåpang retaliated by killing the > missionary priest. \\"It was not that Matåpang defied the missionary’s > spiritual relief but that San Vitores defied Matåpang’s cultural belief. \\"In > so doing … this legendary chief ignited the flames that started a 30-year > war between the Chamorros and the Spanish ... the embers of that fire > continue to burn within the hearts of those who want Guam to be free from > colonial rule.\\" Academic critiques Professor Vince Diaz has critically examined the legacy of Maga'låhi Matå'pang in his presentation and later article \\"In the Wake of Matå'pang's Canoe.\\" His talks deconstruct the varying accounts of Matå’pang from both indigenous and colonial views. In doing so, he utilizes the metaphor of the canoe — the literal and symbolic seafaring vessel of the Chamorros — and delves into the linguistic variations of the word matå’pang between Chamorro and Tagalog. “The first step is to displace momentarily San Vitores as the principle sign in favor of Native perspective and reality, so that the new protagonist is Matå’pang,” said Diaz. “The second step would be to appreciate Matå’pang in native discourse, that is, in terms of how it has and how it can be understood and comprehended in indigenous ways.” See also *Hurao *Gadao References *Bevacqua, Michael Lujan. \\"Matå'pang: Evolution of the Term.\\" Guampedia. *Diaz, Vicente M. \\"In the Wake of Mata'pang's Canoe: The Cultural and Political Possibilities of Indigenous Discursive Flourish.\\" Critical Indigenous Studies.

The village is located approximately northwest of the town of Shepshed, west-northwest of Loughborough, and northeast of Ashby-de-la-Zouch. According to the 2011 Census, the parish (Including Grace-Dieu) had a population of 734. History \\"The Parish Church of Belton is a 14th century structure with a later perpendicular tower, clorestory and roof. It contains the recumbent effigy tomb of Lady Roesia de Verdun, foundress of the nearby Grace Dieu Priory, and Frances Beaumont, Justice of the Common Pleas, was also buried in the church on 22nd April 1598. The registers go back to 1538.\\" Belton also has a Church of England Primary school which caters for children aged between 4 and 10. The original school was founded in 1843 and the present school was built in 1976. Situated on Sadlers Wells in the center of the village. The local football team, Belton Villa FC, play in Division Two of the North Leicestershire Football League. The village is also home to a doctors surgery which is situated at number 1 Mill Lane. Belton has one of the few remaining free-standing maypoles in the country. The village is also home to The Queens Head which is a gastro pub and restaurant situated in the heart of the village. A former coaching inn, it was turned into a public house in the 1800s.  Industry and employment  A graph produced on Excel on the occupation of the Economically active people of belton The earliest occupational data for Belton is from 1881. The stacked bar chart presents a simplified version of the 1881 occupational data, using the 'Orders' used in the published reports for 1881, plus an 'Unknown' category. Many of these categories combine 'Workers and Dealers' in different commodities, therefore it is hard to distinguish workers in manufacturing and services. Occupational data of both male and females in Belton during 1881 The most common occupational area of the time was agriculture. This is more than likely due to the surroundings of Belton; the parish has vast surroundings of arable land still used today. This factor, along with the fact that jobs today may not have existed back then, meant there was a limited number of professions to go into. Agriculture, unsurprisingly, was dominated by males at the time, whereas many of the women's occupation were unknown, or in domestic services. The Occupational data here from the 2011 Census shows us the change over time in all different manner of occupations. The most popular is professional occupations, with around 71 and just under 20% of the economically active residents, followed by managers, directors and senior officials, where there are around 54, which is just under 15% of the economically active population. Of the 734 residents of Belton, there are 358 out of a possible 365 who are economically active between the ages of 16 and 74. This breaks down to 49% of the village being economically active and in employment. Around 15% of the village are retired and the remainder of the village fall under; sick/disabled, students, or look after home/family. Population change in Belton from 1881 to 2011, gaps between 1971 and 1991 Population and housing The earliest record of population in Belton was in 1801, when there was a total of 586 residents in the area. This increased steadily for 50 years to 751. However, a gap in the dataset from 1851 to 1881 shows there was a significant drop between here to 645. From 1881 there was a steady decline until 1911, where after that there has been a steady increase to a current population of 734. This could be down to the boundary changes that happened between 1931 and 1934 which changed the acreage and population of Belton. The 2011 census recorded that 49% of the village was male and 51% female which suggests the gender distribution is rather well balanced. The 2011 census also noted that of the 734 residents, 712 classed themselves as White; English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British (Persons)1. This gives the impression of a very monocultured society. More information showed that the Parish was predominantly Christian, with 69% stating that. Which isn't surprising as Christianity is the most practice religion in the country. A further 20% stated no religion and 9% didn't state theirs. This information isn't unsurprising as due to the low population and the Parish is based around a church, with a Church of England school also at the heart. The likelihood is that Christianity would be the most popular religion. Housing in Belton has fluctuated through the 20th century dropping to 126 houses in 1921 and rising to 184 houses in 1961. Since then there has been a steady increase up to the current number of 315 houses recorded from the last census. The current make up of households are primarily built up of Married/Same sex partnerships without children, followed closely by Married/Same sex partnerships with children.

The patriotic hymn \\"Die Wacht am Rhein\\" uses the text of a poem Schneckenburger wrote in 1840. Schneckenburger was born in Talheim near Tuttlingen, Württemberg. The younger brother of Matthias Schneckenburger, he was a co-owner of an iron blast furnace company, and his business sent him across the Rhine River to Switzerland. Due to this connection, a first version of his poem was set to music and performed there in 1840 by local musicians. This Bern version is now largely forgotten. Schneckenburger died in Burgdorf near Bern. The well-known music to his poem was composed by Karl Wilhelm in 1854, five years after his death. After the use of the song in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 made him and Wilhelm famous, his widow and two sons were granted an annual pension of 3,000 Mark by Otto von Bismarck's Reichskanzleramt. The rest of his German songs were published in Stuttgart in 1870. On 18 July 1886, Schneckenburger's remains were returned to his native town Talheim in the German Empire.  Quote  In a political essay of Schneckenburger in 1840, he calls for a re-arrangement of the \\"patch work\\" European borders into national areas, according to languages spoken, similar to the ideas espoused by Ernst Moritz Arndt. :Bei der ersten neuen Regulierung Europas muß die Schuhflickerorganisation des Wiener Congresses durch die einzig vernünftige und fürderhin einzig zulässige Eintheilung nach nationalen Grundlagen ersetzt werden. Und einer solchen Eintheilung ist es vorbehalten, Deutschland alle seine nach und nach entfremdeten Provinzen wiederzugeben, wobei Arndts Soweit die deutsche Zunge klingt als das richtige Schema für die Gründung eines neuen Deutschland angenommen wird. He also called for secure borders with neighboring countries. :The Watch on the Rhine :A voice resounds like thunder-peal, :'Mid dashing waves and clang of steel: — :The Rhine, the Rhine, the German Rhine! :Who guards to-day my stream divine? :Chorus :Dear Fatherland, no danger thine: :Firm stand thy sons to watch the Rhine! :They stand, a hundred thousand strong, :Quick to avenge their country's wrong; :With filial love their bosoms swell, :They'll guard the sacred landmark well! :The dead of a heroic race :From heaven look down and meet their gaze; :They swear with dauntless heart, O Rhine, :Be German as this breast of mine! :While flows one drop of German blood, :Or sword remains to guard thy flood, :While rifle rests in patriot hand, — :No foe shall tread thy sacred strand! :Our oath resounds, the river flows, :In golden light our banner glows; :Our hearts will guard thy stream divine: :The Rhine, the Rhine, the German Rhine! *Max SchneckenburgerLibrary of the world's best literature, ancient and modern Vol XI p. 16437  References  * Hans Jürgen Hansen.
