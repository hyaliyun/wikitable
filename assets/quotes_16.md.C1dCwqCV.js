He remained in detention for two years without trial. In October 2013, he was released through a presidential amnesty issued by H.E Salva Kiir Mayardit the president of the Republic of South Sudan.

The document put Sule's life in danger, as both the government and the main opposition (SPLM-IO) were unhappy about it. In February 2014, Sule appointed Bona Deng Lawrence as his deputy and relieve and dismissed Sebastian Uchan Kiech from his position as deputy chairman. These changes came due to Uchan's weak leadership. This was proved when Uchan went into hidings in 2011, immediately after chairman Sule was arrested. after his relieve from the position of deputy chairman, He illegally declared himself a parallel chairman of the party. This act harmed party reputation and negatively affected party focus and performance in national issues.

Over the winter of 1676 to 1677, Valenciennes and Cambrai were subjected to a tight blockade, which prevented reinforcements or supplies reaching them from the outside. French armies also benefitted from superior logistics, which allowed them to begin campaigns far earlier than their opponents. Siege operations began on 28 February, supervised by French military engineer Vauban, and the town surrendered on 17 March; Spain formally ceded it to France under the August 1678 Treaty of Nijmegen. Background In the 1667‚Äì1668 War of Devolution, France captured most of the Spanish Netherlands, and the Spanish province of Franche-Comt√©. Louis XIV relinquished most of these gains in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, under pressure from the Triple Alliance of the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden. To split the Alliance, Louis paid Sweden to remain neutral, while signing an alliance with England against the Dutch in the 1670 Treaty of Dover. The Franco-Dutch War began in May 1672 when France invaded the Dutch Republic; they initially seemed to have won an overwhelming victory, but the Dutch position stabilised. Concern at French gains brought them support from Frederick William of Brandenburg-Prussia, Emperor Leopold and Charles II of Spain. France retained the Dutch stronghold of Maastricht, but withdrew from the Netherlands in 1673, additional fronts opening in the Rhineland and the Spanish Pyrenees. The French position weakened in early 1674, when Denmark-Norway joined the Alliance in January, followed by the February Treaty of Westminster making peace between England and the Dutch Republic. Despite this, by the end of 1674, France had re-captured Franche- Comt√©, and made significant gains in Alsace; the focus now changed to consolidation. An effective Allied response in Flanders was hampered by power struggles in Madrid, whose control over the Spanish Netherlands was by now largely nominal. Peace talks had begun at Nijmegen in 1676 but Louis' policy was to take the offensive before agreeing terms and negotiate from strength; the French quickly captured Cond√©-sur-l'Escaut, Bouchain, Maubeuge and Bavay. The capture of Cond√© and Bouchain allowed them to blockade Valenciennes and Cambrai; their cavalry fought skirmishes with the Spanish garrisons and devastated the villages around the towns. Marshal Schomberg, commander of the French field army in Flanders, proposed taking Cambrai in August but was ordered to relieve Maastricht, then under siege by the Dutch. The plan for 1677 was to take Valenciennes, Cambrai and Saint-Omer; this would complete the French fronti√®re de fer or 'iron border,' which Louis calculated would leave the Dutch little reason to continue. To confuse his opponents, the French king travelled to Metz on 7 February, where he inspected the Army of the Moselle, now commanded by Schomberg. Over the winter, Marquis de Louvois assembled supply depots along the border with the Spanish Netherlands, allowing the campaign to open in February, a month earlier than usual. In late February, a detachment of 12,000 men besieged Saint Omer, while the main army of 35,000 men under duc de Luxembourg surrounded Valenciennes, where they were joined by Louis. Battle Valenciennes was positioned on the Rhonelle, a tributary of the Scheldt (French; ), a major trade route giving access to the sea at Antwerp. Until the advent of railways in the 19th century, goods and supplies were largely transported by water and campaigns often focused on gaining access to these. The Spanish Governor was Henri de Melun, Marquis de Richebourg (1623‚Äì1690), an experienced soldier and brother of the Prince d'Epinoy, senior members of the French-speaking nobility in the Spanish Netherlands. He had around 1,150 regular troops, plus two to three thousand civilian auxiliaries and adequate supplies of food and arms. Valenciennes; the remains of the Citadel His position was hopeless without relief, while the early start provided the French by Louvois meant the Dutch were still assembling troops and supplies. Since it was accepted the best defended town could not be held indefinitely, Richebourg's objective was to occupy the attacking force as long as possible. The French military engineer, S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban directed operations, using the siege parallel for the first time since it was pioneered at Maastricht in 1673; the bombardment began on 1 March, but siege works were delayed by heavy rain. For propaganda purposes, Louis often appeared at major sieges and joined Luxembourg at Valenciennes, along with other subordinate commanders including his brother, Philippe of Orl√©ans, d'Humi√®res and La Feuillade. Work on the trenches finally began on 8 March, preparing for an assault on the Porte d'Anzin, the strongest part of the defences but where the ground was driest. By 16 March, Vauban felt they were close enough to launch an attack, and proposed they do so by day. Normal practice was to do so at night, but he argued it would also surprise the defenders, while allowing better co-ordination among the attacking force. His plan was approved, and the French artillery kept up a continuous bombardment during the night of 16th/17th, while an assault force of 4,000 moved into the trenches, including the elite Musketeers of the Guard. At 9:00 a.m. on 17 March, the attackers formed two columns and stormed the walls; they achieved complete surprise and quickly over-ran the defenders, capturing a bridge over the Rhonelle that controlled access to the main city. Both sides wanted to minimise the damage that would follow an assault, since Louis intended to annex it to France, while the conventions of siege warfare shielded a town from being sacked if the defenders yielded once 'a practicable breach' had been made. Richebourg promptly surrendered, and Luxembourg withdrew the attacking troops after the city council agreed to pay a ransom. Aftermath Post-1675, French strategy in Flanders was to create the line of fortresses Vauban called fronti√®re de fer.or 'iron border' After Valenciennes surrendered on 17 March, the main army moved onto Cambrai. An attempt by William of Orange to relieve Saint-Omer was defeated at Cassel on 11 April and Cambrai surrendered on 17 April, followed by Saint-Omer on 20 April. Superior logistics allowed the French to make gains early in the campaigning season, before the Allies could mobilise, then consolidate. The capture of Valenciennes and Cambrai largely completed their 1677 objectives in Flanders. The peace talks at Nijmegen were given a greater sense of urgency in November after William's marriage to his cousin Mary, niece of Charles II of England. An Anglo-Dutch defensive alliance followed in March 1678, although English troops did not arrive in significant numbers until late May; Louis used this opportunity to capture Ypres and Ghent in early March, before signing a peace treaty with the Dutch on 10 August. The war with the Dutch officially ended on 10 August 1678 with the signing of the Treaties of Nijmegen, although a combined Dutch-Spanish army attacked the French at Saint-Denis on 13 August. The agreement ensured Spain retained Mons and on 19 September, they signed their own treaty with France, ceding Saint-Omer, Cassel, Aire, Ypres, Cambrai, Valenciennes and Maubeuge. With the exception of Ypres, returned to Spain in 1697, this fixed France's northern frontier close to where it remains today but the Treaties of Nijmegen proved the highpoint of French expansion under Louis XIV.

Description The effect of adularescence, also commonly referred to as schiller or shiller, is best described as a milky, bluish luster or glow originating from below the surface of the gemstone. The schiller, appearing to move as the stone is turned (or as the light source is moved), gives the impression of lunar light floating on water (accounting for moonstone's name).Long, Bill (2004), \\"Varieties of Light II: Pleochroism, Nacreous, Adularescence, A(d)venturescence.\\" Though white schiller is the most common, in rarer specimens, orange or blue lusters are produced.Semi Precious Stones Guide: List of Gemstone Phenomena This effect is most typically produced by adularia, from which the name derives.King, R.

(2007), Dictionary of Gems and Gemology, Read Books, p. 93. Adularescence appears in numerous other gemstones, notably common opal, rose quartz and agate. However, due to inclusions in these other stones, the effect is displayed differently. The schiller is scattered by inclusions and appears hazy; non-hazy specimens are specially referred to as \\"milky\\". Thus, adularescence occurring in non-adularia gemstones is termed differently ‚Äì the \\"girasol effect\\" and opalescence (for opals only) are two such terms. When the schiller forms an indistinct band, it is said to display a chatoyant effect. Only clearly defined bands are referred to as \\"cat's eyes\\". As an optical phenomenon, adularescence exists only in the presence of light; it is a product of the interaction between light and the internal microstructures of the mineral and not a property of the mineral itself.

He acted in more than 120 films and many of his parts were uncredited. Biography Bing was born in Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany. He was son of the opera singer Max Bing (1865-1919) and Frieda Seckback (1869-1939), and brother of actor Gustav Bing (1893-1967), Clara Bing (1895-1976), and Erna Bing Swarzchild. He was married to Carla Lichtenstein and had one daughter. Bing began his career at the circus, at age 16, and vaudeville showing comedic talent. In 1921 he made his film debut in \\"Ciska Barna, die Zigeunerin\\". He was production chief of several films in Germany before he went to America, in 1923, with director Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau as Murnau's interpreter and assistant director. He also worked under John Ford and Frank Borzage, before establishing himself as a successful character actor well-known for his wild- eyed facial expressions and thick German accent. He provided the voice for the Ringmaster in Walt Disney's Dumbo (1941), and Von Hamburger in Daffy Duck in Hollywood (1938). The start of World War II in Europe caused all things German to be unpopular with audiences. His German accent was no longer in demand in the years following World War II. He became increasingly depressed in the mid-1940s, as he was unable to secure work in Hollywood, and committed suicide by gunshot in 1947.

Sclafini had already been declared as a fugitive from justice, although law enforcement believed that Sclafani was dead. According to mob witness Sammy Gravano, while Paul Castellano was boss of the Gambino family, Sclafani accused Gambino mobster Frank DeCicco of being a mob informant. DeCicco successfully defended himself from this charge and told Gravano that he would murder Sclafani after Castellano was out of power.

A single-engined low-winged monoplane with retractable nosewheel undercarriage, variants include the more powerful WA 4/21 Prestige and the WA-41 Baladou with a fixed undercarriage. Design and development In 1955, Soci√©t√© Wassmer, which was formed in 1905 as an aircraft repair organisation, opened a design department, subsequently building over 300 Jodel aircraft under license before producing its first fully original aircraft, the WA-40 Super Sancy. This was a low-winged monoplane with a retractable nosewheel undercarriage. The fuselage was of steel tube construction with fabric covering, while the wings were of wooden construction. The first prototype flew on 8 June 1959, receiving French certification on 9 June 1960. On the 53rd production aircraft (1963), a swept vertical fin and rudder were incorporated (designated WA.40A; first flying in January 1963 and receiving French certification in March 1963); all subsequent units produced continued the swept design. WA.40A Super IV in 1963 fitted with retractable undercarriage. In 1965 the WA.41, with fixed landing gear was introduced, named Baladou. In March 1967 the Super 4/21 Prestige, powered by a 235 hp (175 kW) Lycoming O-540 engine. The 4/21 used a McCauley variable-pitch propeller, autopilot, electric flaps and IFR instrumentation. An all-metal derivative design, the CE-43 Gu√©pard (Cheetah) was produced by CERVA, a production company which Wassmer and Siren SA formed. It used the same engine as the Prestige (which by 1971 had been upgraded to a 250 hp Lycoming IO-540). Wassmer suffered financial difficulty in 1977, and became insolvent in September 1977. By that time the Gu√©pard offered an optional sixth seat, and designers were developing two further variants, the CE.44 Cougar and the CE.45 L√©opard. However, due to the liquidation, those developments were not finalized, and no further aircraft were produced after September 1977. Variants ;WA-40 Super IV :Original production.

This includes morphology and physiological properties of single neurons. Several techniques such as intracellular recording, patch-clamp, and voltage-clamp technique, pharmacology, confocal imaging, molecular biology, two photon laser scanning microscopy and Ca2+ imaging have been used to study activity at the cellular level. Cellular neuroscience examines the various types of neurons, the functions of different neurons, the influence of neurons upon each other, and how neurons work together.  Neurons and glial cells  Neurons are cells that are specialized to receive, propagate, and transmit electrochemical impulses. In the human brain alone, there are over eighty billion neurons. Neurons are diverse with respect to morphology and function. Thus, not all neurons correspond to the stereotypical motor neuron with dendrites and myelinated axons that conduct action potentials. Some neurons such as photoreceptor cells, for example, do not have myelinated axons that conduct action potentials. Other unipolar neurons found in invertebrates do not even have distinguishing processes such as dendrites. Moreover, the distinctions based on function between neurons and other cells such as cardiac and muscle cells are not helpful. Thus, the fundamental difference between a neuron and a nonneuronal cell is a matter of degree. Another major class of cells found in the nervous system are glial cells. These cells are only recently beginning to receive attention from neurobiologists for being involved not just in nourishment and support of neurons, but also in modulating synapses. For example, Schwann cells, which are a type of glial cell found in the peripheral nervous system, modulate synaptic connections between presynaptic terminals of motor neuron endplates and muscle fibers at neuromuscular junctions.  Neuronal function  One prominent characteristic of many neurons is excitability. Neurons generate electrical impulses or changes in voltage of two types: graded potentials and action potentials. Graded potentials occur when the membrane potential depolarizes and hyperpolarizes in a graded fashion relative to the amount of stimulus that is applied to the neuron. An action potential on the other hand is an all-or-none electrical impulse. Despite being slower than graded potentials, action potentials have the advantage of traveling long distances in axons with little or no decrement. Much of the current knowledge of action potentials comes from squid axon experiments by Sir Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Sir Andrew Huxley.  Action potential  \\"Current Clamp\\" is a common technique in electrophysiology. This is a whole cell current clamp recording of a neuron firing a train of action potentials due to it being depolarized by current injection The Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model of an action potential in the squid giant axon has been the basis for much of the current understanding of the ionic bases of action potentials. Briefly, the model states that the generation of an action potential is determined by two ions: Na+ and K+. An action potential can be divided into several sequential phases: threshold, rising phase, falling phase, undershoot phase, and recovery. Following several local graded depolarizations of the membrane potential, the threshold of excitation is reached, voltage-gated sodium channels are activated, which leads to an influx of Na+ ions. As Na+ ions enter the cell, the membrane potential is further depolarized, and more voltage-gated sodium channels are activated. Such a process is also known as a positive feedback loop. As the rising phase reaches its peak, voltage-gated Na+ channels are inactivated whereas voltage-gated K+ channels are activated, resulting in a net outward movement of K+ ions, which re-polarizes the membrane potential towards the resting membrane potential. Repolarization of the membrane potential continues, resulting in an undershoot phase or absolute refractory period. The undershoot phase occurs because unlike voltage-gated sodium channels, voltage-gated potassium channels inactivate much more slowly. Nevertheless, as more voltage-gated K+ channels become inactivated, the membrane potential recovers to its normal resting steady state..  Structure and formation of synapses  nerve cells. These cells convert their electrical impulses into bursts of neurochemical relayers, called neurotransmitters, which travel across the synapses to receptors on the dendrites of adjacent cells, thereby triggering further electrical impulses to travel down the latter cells. Neurons communicate with one another via synapses. Synapses are specialized junctions between two cells in close apposition to one another. In a synapse, the neuron that sends the signal is the presynaptic neuron and the target cell receives that signal is the postsynaptic neuron or cell. Synapses can be either electrical or chemical. Electrical synapses are characterized by the formation of gap junctions that allow ions and other organic compound to instantaneously pass from one cell to another.Martin, A. R., Wallace, B. G., Fuchs, P. A. & Nicholls, J. G. (2001). From Neuron to Brain: A Cellular and Molecular Approach to the Function of the Nervous System. 4th Ed. Sinauer Associates. Chemical synapses are characterized by the presynaptic release of neurotransmitters that diffuse across a synaptic cleft to bind with postsynaptic receptors. A neurotransmitter is a chemical messenger that is synthesized within neurons themselves and released by these same neurons to communicate with their postsynaptic target cells. A receptor is a transmembrane protein molecule that a neurotransmitter or drug binds. Chemical synapses are slower than electrical synapses.  Neurotransmitter transporters, receptors, and signaling mechanisms  After neurotransmitters are synthesized, they are packaged and stored in vesicles. These vesicles are pooled together in terminal boutons of the presynaptic neuron. When there is a change in voltage in the terminal bouton, voltage-gated calcium channels embedded in the membranes of these boutons become activated. These allow Ca2+ ions to diffuse through these channels and bind with synaptic vesicles within the terminal boutons. Once bounded with Ca2+, the vesicles dock and fuse with the presynaptic membrane, and release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft by a process known as exocytosis. The neurotransmitters then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to postsynaptic receptors embedded on the postsynaptic membrane of another neuron. There are two families of receptors: ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Ionotropic receptors are a combination of a receptor and an ion channel. When ionotropic receptors are activated, certain ion species such as Na+ to enter the postsynaptic neuron, which depolarizes the postsynaptic membrane. If more of the same type of postsynaptic receptors are activated, then more Na+ will enter the postsynaptic membrane and depolarize cell. Metabotropic receptors on the other hand activate second messenger cascade systems that result in the opening of ion channel located some place else on the same postsynaptic membrane. Although slower than ionotropic receptors that function as on-and-off switches, metabotropic receptors have the advantage of changing the cell's responsiveness to ions and other metabolites, examples being gamma amino-butyric acid (inhibitory transmitter), glutamic acid (excitatory transmitter), dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, melanin, serotonin, melatonin, endorphins, dynorphins, nociceptin, and substance P. Postsynaptic depolarizations can either transmit excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters. Those that release excitatory vesicles are referred to as excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). Alternatively, inhibitory vesicles stimulate postsynaptic receptors such as to allow Cl‚àí ions to enter the cell or K+ ions to leave the cell, which results in an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). If the EPSP is dominant, the threshold of excitation in the postsynaptic neuron may be reached, resulting in the generation of an action potential in the neuron(s) in turn postsynaptic to it, propagating the signal.  Synaptic plasticity  Synaptic plasticity is the process whereby strengths of synaptic connections are altered. For example, long-term changes in synaptic connection may result in more postsynaptic receptors being embedded in the postsynaptic membrane, resulting in the strengthening of the synapse. Synaptic plasticity is also found to be the neural mechanism that underlies learning and memory. The basic properties, activity and regulation of membrane currents, synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity, neurotransmission, neuroregensis, synaptogenesis and ion channels of cells are a few other fields studied by cellular neuroscientists. Tissue, cellular and subcellular anatomy are studied to provide insight into mental retardation at the Mental Retardation Research Center MRRC Cellular Neuroscience Core. Journals such as Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience and Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience are published regarding cellular neuroscientific topics.

Also spelled hootchy-kootchy and a number of other variations, it is often associated with \\"The Streets of Cairo, or the Poor Little Country Maid\\" song, also known as \\"the snake charmer song\\". In America, specifically in African-American culture and the music genre the blues, hootchie cootchie refers to the genitals of a drunken woman. The phrase is derived from the terms 'hooch', a slang word for alcohol, specifically home-brewed ‚Äì moonshine ‚Äì or bootlegged (see Rum- runner), and 'coochie', a slang word for a woman's genitals. The term \\"hootchie mama\\" is another phrase with the same meaning. \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" (originally titled \\"I'm Your Hoochie Cooche Man\\") is a blues standard which makes blatant reference to this. It was written by Willie Dixon and first recorded by Muddy Waters in Chicago, January 7, 1954. Numerous cover versions of this classic continue to be recorded. Overview Such dances, or something similar, were performed at the Crystal Palace Exhibition in London in 1851, the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876, and the World's Fair in Paris in 1889. Although such dances became wildly popular in the United States during the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, there is no evidence of them being known by the name, \\"Coochie Coochie\\" until about a year after the fair closed, and \\"Hoochie Coochie\\" about a year later. Before, during and immediately after the fair, these dances were frequently called, \\"Mussel dance\\", \\"stomach dance\\", danse du ventre and sometimes, \\"Kouta Kouta\\". The transition from \\"kouta kouta\\" to \\"coochie coochie\\", and later, \\"hoochie coochie\\", may have been influenced by the expressions, \\"hoochy, coochy, coochy\\", \\"kutchy, kutchy\\", or \\"kutchy, kutchy coo\\", which were found in popular song lyrics from the 1860s and the 1880s. Described by the New York Journal in 1893 as \\"Neither dancing of the head nor the feet\\",Stencell, A. W. Girl Show: Into the Canvas World of Bump and Grind ECW Press, 1999. . p. 605 it was a dance performed by women of, or presented as having, Middle-Eastern or Eastern European Gypsy heritage, often as part of traveling sideshows. The hoochie coochie replaced the much older can-can as the ribald dance of choice in New York dance halls by the 1890s. Since the dance was performed by women, female impersonators or drag queens, a goochie man, or hoochie coochie man, either watched them or ran the show. Alternatively, from the directly sexual meaning of goochie goochie, he was successful with women.

According to local Islamic tradition, the northwest section of the mosque contained the shrine of a famous Islamic saint, Nabi Salih.Al-Abyad MosqueArchnet Digital Library. The minaret is also known as the Tower of the Forty Martyrs. Muslim tradition dating back to 1467 claims that forty of the prophet Muhammad's companions were buried in the mosque, which influenced an erroneous Western Christian tradition from the 16th century that the White Mosque was originally a church dedicated to the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste.

Some two-and-a-half centuries later, Al-Muqaddasi (c. 945/46-991) described it as follows: : =Reconstructions= The White Mosque from the east, early 20th century An earthquake in January 1034 destroyed the mosque, \\"leaving it in a heap of ruins\\", along with a third of the city. In 1047, Nasir Khusraw reported that the mosque had been rebuilt. After the initial construction, ·π¢alƒÅ·∏• ad-Dƒ´n Y≈´suf ibn Ayy≈´b (Saladin) ordered in 1190 one of his outstanding architects, Ilyas Ibn Abd Allah, to supervise what is considered the second construction phase of the mosque. Ilyas built the mosque's western side and the western enclosure wall, together with the central ablutions building. The third phase, in 1267‚Äì1268, began after the final demise of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. On the orders of the Mamluk sultan al-Zahir Baybars, the mosque was rededicated and modified by adding the minaret, the dome, a new pulpit and prayer niche, a portico east of the minaret, and two halls outside the enclosure. Mamluk sultan Muhammad al-Nasir Ibn Qalawun renovated the minaret after an earthquake in October 1318.Haifa University Excavation in Marcus Street Ramala; Reports and studies of the recanati Institute for maritime studies Excavations, Haifa 2007 The Mamluks commissioned restoration works in 1408. ArchitectureOutline and prayer hall= The White Mosque compound is rectangular, , and oriented to the cardinal points. A large, open courtyard is surrounded by built structures and walls. The wide prayer hall stands along the southern wall, with twelve openings northwards to the courtyard. Its ceiling consists of cross-vaults supported by a central row of pillars. The ceiling and the western part of the prayer hall are 12th-century additions made by Saladin, who also had a new mihrab (prayer niche) built. Much of the mosque was built in white marble with cypress and cedar wood used for the doors. Of its four facades, the eastern one is in disrepair. =Minaret (the \\"White Tower\\")= The White Tower after January rains The current, Mamluk-built minaret stands on the northern side of the mosque compound, is square in shape and five stories high, each adorned with window niches, and has a balcony towards the top. The minaret was probably influenced by Crusader design, but it was built by the Mamluks. tall, It is accessed via a staircase with 125 steps and contains small rooms, which could be used for resting or as study rooms. Al-Muqaddasi mentions a minaret in the 10th century. There is speculation about a minaret predating the Mamluk one that may have been located closer to the center of the mosque, as remnants of a square foundation have been found there. However, this may have been just a fountain. =Courtyard and cisterns= Below the central courtyard of the mosque there are three large and well-preserved underground cisterns with barrel-vaults carried by pillars. Two cisterns (the southern and western ones) were filled by an underground water duct probably connected to the aqueduct built simultaneously with the mosque and city and bringing spring water (probably from the vicinity of Gezer to the east). The third, eastern cistern was supplied by runoff rainwater. The reservoirs provided water for the worshipers at the mosque and filled the pool for ablutions at the center of the courtyard, of which only the foundation remains today. Archaeological excavations Excavations conducted in 1949 on behalf of the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Israel Department of Antiquities and Museums revealed that the mosque enclosure was built in the form of a quadrangle and included the mosque itself; two porticoes along the quadrangle's east and west walls; the north wall; the minaret; an unidentified building in the center to the area; and three subterranean cisterns. The mosque was a broadhouse, with a qibla facing Mecca. Two inscriptions were found that mention repairs to the mosque. The first relates that Sultan Baybars built a dome over the minaret and added a door. The second inscription states that in 1408 Seif ed-Din Baighut ez-Zahiri had the walls of the southern cistern coated with plaster.White Mosque in Ramle, UNESCO \\"Tentative Lists\\" for World Heritage sites, submitted 30/06/2000.

The Lake is physiographically characterized by a saucer shaped basin with gentle slope and a much silted bottom. Physico-chemical analysis of the water samples from the lake reveal highly polluted condition. There occurs rise in the water temperature while the turbidity rate also stands high. The water in many areas is found to be highly acidic (pH-3.6) while in other areas high alkalinity (pH-9.3) has been noticed. Observation of high concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide coupled with lower values of dissolved oxygen in different seasons reveal the deteriorating quality of water.

Dozens were killed and wounded, including an Iranian diplomat and his son, before Tian was finally shot dead by a police sniper.Police Identify Gunman As Member Of Chinese Army, The Seattle Times (September 21, 1994)Details surface on Chinese officer's shooting spree, Philadelphia Inquirer (September 24, 1994)Ex-Chinese military officers protest over \\"work, life issues\\", BBC (July 9, 2008) Background Tian Mingjian (born in 1964) was a first lieutenant stationed at an army base in Tongxian County, a suburb of Beijing. He had been in the military for over ten years, originally as a sharpshooter and was highly skilled in the military technology field. He was once promoted to regimental staff officer for military affairs but due to his bad temper and irritability was eventually demoted to acting company commander. At the time of the shooting he served in this position in the 12th Regiment of the Third Guards Division of the Beijing Garrison Command.Case of soldier shooting people in Beijing results in stepping down of commander and political commissar of Beijing Garrison Garrison Command, Lien Ho Pao (7 December 1994), in Summary of World Broadcasts: Asia, Pacific, Part 3; British Broadcasting Corporation, 06. 12. 1994 He was said to have violated discipline by beating other soldiers and had a grievance against his superiors for being reprimanded about this. Tian was married but due to his demotion his wife was not allowed to live with him at the base. He sent gifts to the regimental political commissar, who then promised to help him in this matter, but two days prior to the shooting the commissar returned the gifts and hinted that he would punish Tian.Beijing Garrison Commander, Political Commissar Dismissed in the Wake of Jianguomen Shooting Incident, Lien Ho Pao (7 February 1995), in Daily Report: People's Republic of China, Iss. 21-30; National Technical Information Service, 1995. It was also reported that Tian had a quarrel with his superiors because they had forced his wife to have an abortion when she was pregnant with their second child, in accordance with China's One-child policy. Tian already had a daughter, but he came from the rural area in Henan Province, where strong traditional values emphasize siring a male child. Thus Tian secretly planned on having a son until someone in the army revealed his plan and the birth control officer forced his wife to have an abortion. By this time his wife was already seven months pregnant and died during the operation along with the unborn fetus (later discovered to be a boy).Moody, Peter R.: China Documents Annual; Academic International Press, 1994. ShootingArmy base= On 20 September Tian armed himself with a Type 81 assault rifle and killed the regimental political commissar on the drill ground. He also killed three other military officials who were trying to stop him and injured at least ten more before fleeing the military base. While his fellow soldiers were ordered to change into civilian clothing in order to not disturb the public when searching for the deserter, Tian hijacked a jeep and headed towards Beijing. Other reports stated he boarded a bus. =Jianguomen= At 7:20 a.m., when approaching a red light in Jianguomen, the driver crashed his vehicle into a tree and tried to escape. Tian killed him, jumped out of the car and started to shoot people at random while making his way towards the embassy district. He thus killed 17 civilians, including Iranian diplomat Yousef Mohammadi Pishknari and his 9-year-old son, while another of Pishknari's sons and his daughter were wounded. By then thousands of police were rushing to the scene and desperately tried to apprehend the gunman, but were unable to do so, since Tian was an experienced and excellent marksman. Police finally besieged Tian at Yabao Road and engaged in a gunbattle with him, in which 7 policemen were killed. A bus was caught in the line of fire, when the driver in panic stopped his vehicle. Eventually, heavy police fire forced Tian to flee into a dead end where he was killed by a sniper. The exact number of casualties remains unknown, though in the immediate aftermath 14 people were reported dead, and 72 others wounded, many of them so severely that doctors expected the death toll to rise to 40 or 50.14 dead in Beijing shooting, New Straits Times (September 22, 1994) The newspaper Lien Ho Pao reported on 7 December the same year that 15 people were killed, among them six servicemen, and 60 others were wounded. Aftermath When Canadian television began to report live about the shooting at the embassy district, satellite transmission was immediately turned off by the Chinese government and further reporting, including on-site interviews, were prohibited. Shortly after the shooting, the Beijing Garrison Command (BGC) was ordered by the Central Military Commission to conduct a thorough review of the incident. The investigation was organized by the People's Liberation Army's General Staff Headquarters and the General Political Department and headed by Zhang Zhen, then vice chairman of the Central Military Commission. Due to the investigation the commander of the Beijing Military Region, Lieutenant General Li Laizhu, and its political commissar, Lieutenant General Gu Shanqing, were given serious warnings as a disciplinary sanction and serious demerits within the party. It also resulted in the dismissal and demeriting of BGC commander Major General Liu Fengjun and BGC political commissar Major General Yang Huichuan, who were then replaced by He Daoquan and Zhang Baokang. Additionally the commander and political commissar of the Third Guards Division, as well as the commander of the 12th Regiment and all battalion commanders and instructors under his command, were dismissed while several military officials of the Political Department of the Beijing Military Region, and the Beijing Garrison Headquarters and Political Department were punished. In total, about 60 military officials were punished, demerited, or dismissed as a consequence of the shooting.

Her great roles included Elizabeth in Mary Stuart (1800) and Beatrice in The Bride of Messina (1803). She is also notable as a mistress of Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, the father of her three children. Both she and Karl August had their portraits painted by Heinrich Christoph Kolbe. Life Ferdinand Henriette Karoline Friedericke Jagemann was the daughter of the scholar and librarian Christian Joseph Jagemann (1735‚Äì1804), and sister of the painter Ferdinand Jagemann (1780‚Äì1820). She studied first at the Weimar Princely Free Zeichenschule, where her brother was later a lecturer. From 1790 she trained in acting and singing in Mannheim under August Iffland and Heinrich Beck. She made her debut in 1792 in the title role of the opera Oberon ‚Äì The Fairy King by Paul Wranitzky at Mannheim's Nationaltheater and was engaged as a court-singer in Weimar in 1797.

Life Mendenhall was born in Marlboro, Ohio to William King Mendenhall and Emma P. Garrigues. He graduated from Ohio Normal University. He married Alice May Boutelle (born 1876); the couple had two daughters, Margaret Boutelle Mendenhall (born 1916) and Alice Curran Mendenhall (born 1918). USGS career In December 1930, Hoover appointed George Otis Smith to the newly reorganized Federal Power Commission and then appointed Walter C. Mendenhall to succeed Smith as Director of the US Geological Survey, honoring not only a commitment to appoint the heads of scientific agencies from within the civil service but also a commitment to support basic research. Mendenhall and Smith were both 59 years old. Mendenhall had joined the Survey in 1894, fresh from Ohio Normal University, and had mapped in the Appalachian coal fields. In 1898, he had been one of the pioneer geologists in Alaska, and in 1903 he had become one of the first ground-water specialists in the Water Resources Branch. An early member of the Land Classification Board, he became its chairman in 1911 and in 1912 the first Chief of the Land Classification Branch. For eight years before becoming Director, Mendenhall had been the Chief Geologist. Although more than half his surveying career had been in administrative work, he had made notable contributions to the geology of Alaska, and his study of the principles in ground-water hydrology had helped to establish it as a field of scientific endeavor. King, Powell, Walcott and Mendenhall all were members of the National Academy of Sciences.National Academy of Sciences website/profile Mendenhall's directorate was pivotal in the history of the Geological Survey. In spite of the difficult times, the depression years, and the beginning of World War II, he encouraged the Survey, as he had the Geologic Branch, to emphasize the necessity of basic research and created an environment in which, in the words of the Engineering and Mining Journal, \\"scientific research, technical integrity, and practical skill could flourish.\\" A year after Mendenhall became Director, the Federal budget was sharply cut as the effects of the depression began to be felt. The appropriations were not restored to earlier levels until the late 1930s, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, but the Survey subsisted, even grew, on funds transferred from agencies formed to combat the depression by the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. The Tennessee Valley Authority, established in May 1933, turned to the Survey to meet its need for maps of the entire valley and for a much expanded program of stream gaging throughout the basin. In 1943, as the Federal Government began planning for the postwar era, Director Mendenhall, who had served 2 years beyond then mandatory retirement age by Presidential exemption, was succeeded by William Embry Wrather.USGS HistoryWalter Curran Mendenhall biography.

Those such instruments that are linked to property losses due to natural catastrophes represent a unique asset class, the return from which is uncorrelated with that of the general financial market. Overview Insurance companies are in the business of assuming risk for individuals and institutions. They manage those risks by diversifying over a large number of policies, perils and geographic regions. There are two important ways insurers profit in this business. One is by selling portfolios of insurance policies grouped into packages, to interested investors. The risk from low severity, high probability events can be diversified by writing a large number of similar policies. This reduces an insurer‚Äôs risk because should a policy default, then the loss is shared between a large number of investors. The second way insurers profit on policies is by re-insuring them through other insurers. A reinsurance policy would allow a second insurer to share in the gain and potential loss of the policy, much like an investor. The secondary insurer would share invested interest and risk.Canabarro, Eduardo, Markus Finkemeier, Richard R. Anderson, and Fouad Bendimerad. \\"Analyzing Insurance-Linked Securities.\\" Fixed income Research ‚Äì Quantitative Research (1998): 38. Web. Jun 20, 2010. The reinsurance of policies offers additional risk capital and high returns for the policy originator, and minimizes their liability, while also providing high returns for any secondary insurer. History Since 2001, the market for insurance-linked securities has increased substantially, creating an industry with over $15 billion trading between capital market investors.Boucher, Mathieu. \\"Development in the insurance-linked securities (ILS) life market, post financial crisis.\\" 2009 East Asian Actuarial Conference. (2009): 14. Print. The union of insurance risks with the capital market created a new method for insurers to spread their risk and raise capital. Insurance-linked securities provide life insurance companies with the ability to transfer or spread their risk while releasing its value to the open market through asset- backed notes. This emerging market showed much potential and growth until the collapse of the CDO market, with the effect of disrupting the ILS market. The collapse of sub-prime collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, had a disastrous effect on all structured financial markets, including life insurance risk. The high complexity of life insurance securitization is one of the reasons for the collapse of the insurance-linked securities market. Purpose The market for insurance linked securities has been very attractive for investors and insurers. One portion of insurance linked securities is the reinsurance of high severity, low probability events known as CAT bonds, or catastrophe bonds. These include cover for natural disasters and other uncontrollable events. These policies are grouped by their assessed risk, and then re-insured by other insurers. CAT bonds are very risky in general. Therefore, an insurer will try to minimize risk by writing many such policies. If an insurer charges a premium equal to the expected annual loss, it can stand to profit by those premiums by the law of large numbers. Another way insurance companies can spread their risk from CAT bonds is to transfer risk to another insurer, thereby re-insuring the original insurer‚Äôs portfolio and minimizing liability. A re-insurance policy could assume a loss of ‚Äú$10 million above $50 million with 5% participation.‚Äù In this scenario, the secondary insurer pledges to pay the policy originator up to 95% of $10 million for any loss above $50 million. Investors are attracted to these contracts because they are unrelated to financial markets. That is where the capital markets and insurance-linked securities meet, through derivative or securities markets. CAT bonds are grouped by their level of risk and sold in portfolios in security markets. This makes re-insuring these contracts more attractive because it opens a whole market for them to be sold and for risk to be spread among many investors. It is much more attractive to write expensive, risky policies and share the risk with thousands of others than it is for one firm to assume total liability. Types The most prevalent securitized insurance contracts exchanged in capital markets include: * Catastrophe bonds * Embedded Value Securitization * Extreme Mortality Securitization * Life Settlements Securitization * Longevity Swaps * Reserve Funding Securitization * Fully Collateralized Reinsurance Issuance To issue an ILS in the security or derivative market, an insurer would first issue an SPV, or Special purpose vehicle. An SPV has two functions; it provides re-insurance for insurance companies and issues securities to investors. At first, an SPV deposits funds collected by investors into a trust. Any interested parties will pay a premium to the SPV. The money from the premium and investment income will provide the interest payments owed to investors. If there is no catastrophic event, or trigger event, before the maturity date of the contract, investors will receive back their principal investment at maturity on top of the interest payments they have received.

But there could be one thing that finally can break the special connection between them: The question if or if not Sebastian could be the father of Lydia's newborn sister Christina. Jens places a bug in the Brandner house and sends an anonymous message to Lydia. She guesses that Jens is behind it and wants to talk to him. But the situation gets out of control, when Lydia tells him again that it's over between them, he threatens to kill himself right in front of her.

Sebastian appeals on their old friendship and wants Jens to see that he needs help. Jens goes completely crazy and knows Sebastian down. Jens is shocked of his own doing, when he thinks that he killed Sebastian. He tries to get rid of his body, when he discovers that Sebastian is still alive. Jens decides to take him to an empty warehouse in an industrial area, where nobody would find him. Sebastian realizes that he is surrendered by Jens, who tries to make up his mind how to go from here. He soon needs to hear that Lydia is worried over Sebastian and asks questions where he might have been. She even gets a bad feeling that something happened to him, when she gets a text message from Sebastian's mobile phone. The message says that he is in Munich to speak with Jens' brother over the condition that Jens is in. Lydia is relieved for a few days. But when Sebastian does not shows up to an important meeting, she is questioning his whereabouts. Jens hears from the worry over the bug and pays a visit to Sebastian, who is in a really bad shape. With a knife he gets threaten by Jens to write a letter, which, after Jens' thinking, will stop the questions and the search for Sebastian. Lydia and the Lahnstein family find out eventually that Sebastian is kidnapped and he is rescued by Lydia, after she gets alarmed when Jens tries to get close to her again. Jens gets committed to a psychiatric hospital, where he tells Lydia that he will always be with her. Sebastian has to suffer serious nightmares after his kidnapping, resulting dreaming and hallucinating about Jens. He tries to keep his condition a secret to Lydia, but she eventually gets behind what Sebastian still has to deal with and begs him to get professional help. After an argument Sebastian finally agrees and gets rid of Jens' daily present in his life. Over a year goes by, Sebastian (now played by Sebastian Schlemmer) and Lydia got married, but are not a happy couple anymore. Sebastian seems to live for his work and this results with Lydia starting an affair with Sebastian's cousin Ansgar von Lahnstein (Wolfram Grandezka). After Lydia has another encounter with Ansgar, she drives away and literally bumps into Jens. He finds out about her affair with Ansgar and in his twisted way, sees that as a chance to be together with her again, because for him it finally proves that Lydia's love for Sebastian is not that strong. Jens threatens Lydia to tell Sebastian about the affair and even gives him photos that prove him right. But Sebastian trusts his wife and believes Jens manipulated them in order to destroy his marriage. Meanwhile, Ansgar knows about Lydia's fear of Jens and tries to scare him off. Anyway, Jens does not stop and discovers the secret place where Ansgar and Lydia meet. He overpowers Ansgar and captivates him before getting Lydia in his grip. Jens even tries to rape Lydia, before Ansgar can free himself and tries to protect Lydia. It comes to a fight between the men. As Jens seems to get stronger, Lydia pushes him away from Ansgar, which leads for Jens to break his neck on the door frame. He's immediately dead to the shock of Lydia, who has to overcome that she killed somebody. Ansgar realizes that Jens' death could expose their affair after all and wants to protect Lydia by taking the fault and covering the tracks of their affair.

The complex comprised a coke works, tar works and a power station. Built on the site of Dockendale Hall in 1904, it was operated by the Priestman Collieries until the 1970s. The power station at the plant, known as Blaydon Burn Power Station or the Priestman Power Station was fuelled by waste heat from the coking process. In the 1910s, a number of advancements in steam turbine technology were first implemented at the station. History Otto - Hilgenstock Coke Oven drawing In 1853 a shaft was sunk for the Blaydon Main coal seam at Blaydon Burn, and in 1902 a coke works was set up on the site of the nearby Dockendale Hall. This was operated by the Priestman Power Company, producing coke using 80 coke ovens, made by the Otto-Hilgenstock company of Germany. By the 1950s, 90 ovens were operating at the plant. In 1958, one battery, equating to about half of the plant's ovens, were shut down along with ovens at Shotton Colliery and Whinfield coke works. This affected the employment of 150 men, as many of whom the National Coal Board and the union tried to find alternative employment for. The closures were due to a reorganisation of the industry by the board. At this point the works at Ottovale were one of the oldest coking plants in the Durham coalfield. Power station The power station was constructed in 1904 to use waste heat produced by the coke ovens. The heat was piped from the coke ovens to under four land-type Babcock & Wilcox boilers, each with 500 HP capacity. The boilers supplied steam for two 275 kilowatt (kW) Parsons three phase turbo alternators. At the time of opening, this generating equipment was of the latest and best design. The alternators produced 6,000 volts. The electricity generated by the station was initially used as a power supply for the coal mine, but the Priestman Power Company was bought by the Newcastle- upon-Tyne Electric Supply Company in 1914, meaning the electricity was also used to power the rest of the county, using the County Durham distribution system. Feed water for the boilers was taken from the Blaydon Burn, upon which the station was built. However, there wasn't a sufficient amount of water available for condensing purposes as well, and so the condensing water needed to be used over and over again. This necessitated the construction of a cooling tower and reservoir. The station's boiler house and turbine hall were of a steel framed construction, with corrugated iron cladding. The advantage of this type of construction is that if the coke ovens were to be abandoned, the station could be deconstructed and re-erected somewhere else at a minimal cost. In 1916, the station's generating equipment was replaced by a 3,000 kW Parsons generating set. This was the first generating set in the world to use reheated steam between stages in its turbines, and to progressively heat feed- water using partially expanded steam. In 1919 the station was further modified, becoming the first station in the world to use an enclosed ventilating circuit for the alternator with a gilled-tube cooler for extracting the heat from the ventilating air, which overcame problems caused by dust and moisture getting into the windings. When the UK's national grid distribution system was brought into use in 1932, the station was one of a small number of stations in the region to be converted from the 40 hertz (Hz) frequency used by the North Eastern grid system to the 50 Hz frequency used by the national system. The station ceased operating in 1959. Reclamation of the coke works began in the 1970s and the area has now been returned to grassland. An electrical substation still stands near the site.

Using Census Bureau statistics, a commissioned poll of 3,700 men and women ages 25 to 40 and personal interviews, Whelan showed that while the stereotype was valid among previous generations, today a higher income and education in fact increases a woman's marriage chances, and that high-achieving women simply marry later in life. Prior to conducting the research, Whelan originally intended for the book to be a pessimistic take on the marriage prospects of professional women, drawn from popular studies and personal experience. The book was initially conceived with the title Overqualified for Love. Whelan's second book, Marry Smart: The Intelligent Woman's Guide to True Love, was published by Simon & Schuster on December 30, 2008. Whelan's third book, Generation WTF: From ‚ÄúWhat the #%$&‚Äù to a Wise, Tenacious, and Fearless You, was published by Templeton Press in February 2011. Whelan's fourth book, The Big Picture: A Guide to Finding Your Purpose in Life, was published in May 2016. Public appearances Whelan has frequently appeared as an expert commentator on television news programs, including The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, Good Morning America, and on national radio programs, including Iowa Public Radio, Wisconsin Public Radio, and the BBC Whelan is a frequent featured speaker at public events and academic conferences. Personal Whelan has three young children.

Description  Out of the seven subspecies of sharp- tailed grouse, the Columbian is the smallest at 15‚Äì20 inches (38‚Äì51 cm) in length. They have plumage with a base of grayish-brown, white and black markings, and a white wedge-shaped tail. Males have a longer tail, a purple throat patch and a yellow comb over the eye.  Distribution and habitat  Its historical range extended from British Columbia south through eastern Washington and Oregon to Northeastern California, Nevada, and Utah, and then west to the Continental Divide. It inhabits sagebrush-bunchgrass prairies, meadow-steppe, mountain shrub, and riparian zones. It was first described by the Lewis and Clark expedition, and was named by George Ord.  Status and conservation  Due to excessive habitat loss, it is no longer present in the majority of its range, and exists only in isolated remnant populations that comprise less than ten percent of its original habitat. These populations are sequestered in central British Columbia, southeastern Idaho and northern Utah, and northwestern Colorado and south-central Wyoming. It was extirpated entirely from Oregon by the 1960s, but was reintroduced in Wallowa County beginning in 1991; a small population of the birds now persists in the Leap Area of Zumwalt Prairie. The Columbian sharp-tailed grouse was petitioned to be listed as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act twice, but was denied in both cases. It is currently considered a Species of Concern in several U.S. states.

On December 23, 2008, Toussie was granted a pardon by President George W. Bush; however, this pardon was revoked the following day, amid controversy over its apparent impropriety. Crimes and conviction Toussie entered the real estate business with his father, Robert Toussie, in 1993. In 1999, Isaac Toussie was charged with making false statements to the Department of Housing and Urban Development in obtaining mortgages, and with mail fraud, stemming from a letter he sent to Suffolk County officials which overstated the value of a property the county would later buy from Toussie's father. Toussie pleaded guilty on May 24, 2001 to the false statement charge. He subsequently pleaded guilty on December 10, 2002 to the mail fraud charge. In July 2003, Toussie was sentenced to five months of incarceration, followed by three years of probation, and on September 22, 2003, he was fined $10,000. Isaac Toussie and his father are among the co-defendants in an ongoing class action suit, filed in 2001 by 400 families who claim they were sold shoddily- constructed properties at inflated prices, and told that property taxes would be reduced or deferred. Homeowners paid between US$160,000 and $200,000 for the Suffolk County and Staten Island homes. The suit is the largest ever real estate discrimination suit in New York State. Toussie placed advertisements in New York City newspapers, offering affordable housing and easy financing, even to individuals with poor credit. The suit claims that these ads included fake endorsements from black celebrities, including Whoopi Goldberg and Maya Angelou. Investigators discovered that Toussie had worked with various real estate attorneys, mortgage bankers and home appraisers to get mortgages for hundreds of low-income home-buyers who wouldn't otherwise qualify, and then sell those same people low-quality, overpriced houses that they couldn't afford. Pardon and revocation On December 23, 2008, President Bush granted a pardon to Toussie, angering people who felt Toussie had defrauded them. However, the pardon was withdrawn the next day, following a report by the New York Daily News that Toussie's father, Robert Toussie, had given $28,500 to the Republican Party and $2,300 to the presidential campaign of U.S. Senator John McCain. White House press secretary Dana Perino stated that the pardon would be reviewed, in light of the new information. A White House press release read, in part: The action by Mr. Bush to revoke the pardon is considered unprecedented, and it is unclear that the president has the power to withdraw a pardon. However, the Justice Department has stated that the pardon was never official, having never been delivered to the person who requested it, and that Toussie would have no legal ground on which to challenge the withdrawal. It appears that the pardon would have made it possible for Toussie to re-enter the real estate business in New York state, which he would not be able to do as a felon. The pardon was also unusual in that it violated a Justice Department guideline stipulating that convicted criminals not be considered for pardons less than five years after the completion of their sentences. The president is not legally bound by the Justice Department guideline. Toussie's legal representation apparently bypassed normal procedure, and appealed directly to the administration, rather than going through the Justice Department or the chain of command. Toussie's lawyer, Bernard Berenson, was formerly part of the Office of the White House Counsel. White House Counsel Fred Fielding approved the application for the pardon. On December 27, the Daily News published a photograph of the elder Toussie shaking hands with President Bush, posed in front of an American flag.

Biography Shmatko became a sculptor at the age of 33, having previously been a firefighter.Smirnova, Helen (September 10, 2003), \\"I lived 13 years in a vault\\", Facts and comments (Ukraine, Donetsk) The life of Nikolai Shmatko was full of strange, sometimes mystical coincidences. In 1996 he met the famous model and gallerist Dina Vierny in France, who predicted his great future and advised him \\"not to scatter his works worldwide\\". During all his creative development Nikolai Shmatko created more than 750 various monuments and about 500 pictures without any support from the government or sponsors. He worked in marble, inspired by European culture and art. His studio and gallery contain 100 sculptures (more than 70 of which are made of Ural and Italian marble); 30 plaster casts; and about 300 pictures (including paintings, graphics, and architectural designs). In total, there are approximately 750 pieces, ranging from simple decorations to bas-relief and high relief busts and sculptures. Some of these pieces are sexually explicit. Shmatko also worked in architecture, and had a design for a penis-shaped high-rise building. In 2004, for his work \\"Sviatohorska Blessed Virgin\\" - a statue of the Virgin Mary (Theotokos \\"Hegumenia\\") for Sviato-Uspenskyi Sviatohorskyi Monastery - Shmatko was awarded the order of Nestor Letopisets by Volodymyr Sabodan, the Kiev Metropolitan, and all of Ukraine. In the autumn of 2005 the Transfiguration church was opened in the village of Keleberda, Poltava region. Exclusively for this church, the sculptor created a marble sculpture \\"The Crucifixion\\". In the fall of 2012, at the invitation of oligarch Viktor Baloha, Shmatko moved with his family to the city of Mukachevo.

It was originally designed by architect Wellington Tabor and purchased in June 1900 by furniture designer Gustav Stickley. On the outside, it is similar to many other houses on the block and in the neighborhood, not far from Syracuse University. However, the chestnut wall paneling and beamed interior that Stickley designed is regarded as the first comprehensive American Craftsman residential interior in the United States. Stickley owned this house between 1900 and 1911. On December 24, 1901, a chimney fire greatly damaged the house and the interior was renovated in 1902 by Stickley, who was by then a leading figure of the American Craftsman movement. After the death of his wife, Gustav lived with his daughter Barbara Stickley Wiles & her family at this house from 1919 to his death there in 1942. and Accompanying eight photos, exterior and interior, from 1983 Renderings of the interior and floor plans were published in December 1902 in The Craftsman, a magazine that Stickley founded in 1901.

A student of Johann Heinrich Tischbein, he was also a teacher himself (his pupils included Ferdinand Jagemann), as well as an entrepreneur and friend of Goethe. He was a co-founder of the F√ºrstliche freie Zeichenschule Weimar with Friedrich Justin Bertuch in 1776. Life Georg Melchior Kraus was the sixth of nine children, though five of these died before reaching a year. His parents Cornelia Kraus (n√©e Paulsen) and Johann Georg Kraus ran the \\"Zur weissen Schlangen\\" hotel in the Sandgasse in Frankfurt. Georg Melchior Kraus was eight when his father remarried after Cornelia's early death. From 1759 to 1762 he trained in the studio of the court painter Johann Heinrich Tischbein the Elder at the court of landgraf Frederick II of Hesse-Kassel. In November 1762 Georg Melchior travelled to Paris to study under the best-known copper-engraver of the time, Johann Georg Wille. In Paris he also came into contact with the genre painter Jean-Baptiste Greuze and soon became \\"genre painter familiar to His Holiness the prince bishop of Wirsbourg\\" At the end of 1766 Kraus returned to Frankfurt, at first becoming a private tutor and genre painter. He maintained his French contacts so well that in 1776 he was included on Colis√©e's list as a genre painter. In Frankfurt his pupils included Sophie von La Roche, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, while he also unsuccessfully petitioned the city council on 2 April 1767 for the establishment of a painting academy.

His work has focused on the diffusion of yoga in Europe and its introduction into medical treatments. He founded the International Yoga Institute and an international yoga teacher training school, active now in Africa, America, Asia and Europe. He introduced a new way of teaching yoga based on Indian Hatha yoga asanas, Egyptian postures and Chinese exercises attributed by the Shaolin monks to Bodhidharma.About the three aspects of Khane's yoga teaching, see Jean-Fran√ßois Mayer, Les nouvelles voies spirituelles, Nationales Forschungsprogramm 21‚ÄîKulturelle Vielfalt und Nationale Identit√§t, L'√Çge d'Homme, 1993, p. 197, , He is one proponent of \\"Egyptian yoga\\", a branch of yoga based on the observation of the ancient-Egyptian art.  Biography  Khane was born in Dakar, into a Sufi family. He learned yoga at an early age and became a disciple of Paramahansa Yogananda. He founded the first center of the International Yoga Institute (or Institut International de Yoga) in Dakar, in 1960. In 1964, he was invited by Philippe Baumgartner, a French gerontologist and author of several books (among them, L'Homme et son √Çge, Julliard, Paris, 1959; and 101 Conseils pour retrouver et d√©velopper la m√©moire, Hachette, Paris, 1976, ) to take part with him in several international medical conferences in order to explain and show how yoga might be helpful against the ageing process. In 1965, Baumgartner asked him to collaborate with him in the treatment of his rheumatic patients in Aix-les- Bains. Both organised later an annual course of treatment in Gor√©e. This collaboration lasted until the death of Baumgartner in 1980 and was very important for the genesis of the therapeutic and preventive yoga method created by Khane. Baumgartner introduced Khane in several important European yoga schools and federations who invited him soon to give often seminars and hatha-yoga demonstrations. In 1972, he opened his first yoga teacher training school in Switzerland.About Khane's biography and the beginning of his yoga teaching in Switzerland, see Jean-Fran√ßois Mayer, op. cit., p. 197 In 1974, he became a member of the pedagogic committee of the F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise de Yoga (called now the FNEY). In 1978, he decided to leave this Federation and devote himself entirely to the development of the International Yoga Institute in Europe, Africa and America. His yoga school now has branches in many countries throughout the world. Khane's teaching method When he began to introduce yoga in the treatment of Baumgartner's old and rheumatic patients, Khane had to adapt his teaching to the limited abilities of this new audience. For pedagogic reasons, he decided to introduce into his hatha-yoga lessons some Chinese exercises based on the inner style (Nei Shia) of the kung-fu methodThis method is different from the martial kung-fu and has some spiritual effects : about this question, see Jean-Fran√ßois Meyer, op. cit., p. 197 attributed to the Indian Buddhist monk Bodhidharma. He used in addition some postures depicted in the temples of ancient Egypt, which he calls \\"Egyptian yoga\\".  Khane and Egyptian yoga  Image:Empereur romain effectuant en tant que pharaon le geste de soutien du ciel.jpgAn Egyptian attitude, Dendera Temple. Image:Hieroglyph representing the infinite. Karnak, White Chapel of Senusret I.jpgThe deity Heh, symbol of eternity, Karnak, White Chapel of Senusret I. Image:Yogi Khane reproducing a hieroglyph.jpegKhane reproducing the hieroglyph qÍú£ (A28) and the attitude of god Shu. Khane wrote several books about \\"Egyptian yoga\\". He claimed in those books that some hatha-yoga asanas were practised in ancient Egypt. Khane claims in addition that other poses represented in Egyptian temples and graves had similar effects to the Indian one and could be considered as yoga postures. As Khane mentions himself,Le Yoga des Pharaons, p. 9 some \\"Egyptian\\" postures had been taught in the past by Hanish (Mazdanan, 1932), and A. de Sambucy, who wrote in the sixties the book Le Yoga irano-√©gyptien. Khane built a complete pedagogic system based on the Egyptian bas-reliefs and paintings, and studied the similarities between some Egyptian words or pharaonic symbols and Indian yogic concepts. He proposes to see in Pharao a model of the human realization.see M. Adam, op. cit. The assertion made by Khane in many of his books, lectures, interviews and articles is that signs of the existence of yoga appear at approximately the same time in India and Egypt, and that the two traditions are very close, but parallel. For Khane, yoga is a universal legacy kept in life and passed down to humanity through generations by India, despite the fact that it is possible to find numerous traces of yoga in Ancient Egypt and perhaps in a few Judaeo- Christian or Islamic practices.Numerous academic authors coming from very varied backgrounds, in particular Pr Cheikh Anta Diop and the French egyptologist Christiane Desroches Noblecourt (see Le fabuleux h√©ritage de l'√âgypte, and Pr. Christian Cannuyer whose thesis theme was the Egyptian origin of the Christian heartprayer, wrote about Egypt's contribution to others religions. About Khane's position in this subject, see in particular Le Yoga des Pharaons, p. 213-220 (chapter entitled \\"Mo√Øse et l'h√©ritage √©gyptien\\" or p. 39-42, where he compares Christ's and christian priest's attitude to an ancient Egyptian one. For him what is important in the fact that yoga was practiced in Egypt, is that it is a link between several spiritual traditions and a factor of unity for humanity.see Le Yoga des Pharaons, p. 9-11, where he evokes the teaching by Yogananda and his master, Sr√Æ Yukteswar, about the unity of the spiritual message and suggests Ancient Egypt as a possible historical basis to this unity. The idea that yoga was practised in Ancient Egypt is now accepted by several European writers specialized in the study of the spirituality.see Marc-Alain Descamps : II a m√™me exist√© un \\" yoga irano-√©gyptien \\" qui a ete enseign√© d√®s 1932 par le Dr. Hanish d'apr√®s les Mazdanans, puis vers 1960 par le Dr. De Sambucy et enfin par Babacar Khane de Dakar . See in addition some lectures made by the psychiatrist and writer Jacques Vigne. Khane is generally accepted by other yoga schools as one of the main exponents of Egyptian yoga. Davina Delor writes : \\"Babacar Khane est le ma√Ætre contemporain r√©v√©lateur du Yoga des Pharaons.\\"Davina, Maxi Yoga, Marabout, Paris, 2003, G√©rard Blitz, former General Secretary of the European Union of National Yoga Federations (UEFNY, called now European Union of Yoga) credits him with having found the traces of the Egyptian yoga \\"Es este hombre que se interesa al Yoga Egipcio, Yoga de el que √©l su esposa han vuelto a encontrar huellas en una civilizaci√≥n antigua de al menos seis mil anos (ver su libro : \\"El Yoga de los Faraones\\"Preface to El Yoga de la Plegaria, translation by Margot Paccaud, p. 4) and asked him to conduct several international yogic trips (1987, 1989, 1991) to Egypt under the patronage of the European Union of National Yoga Federations. In Africa, Senghor in one of his official speeches,Journ√©es de la Jeunesse, 1980 (?). called upon Senegalese youth and athletes to return beyond Greece to their Egyptian roots, following the path opened by Khane.

Khane has been selected as member of the World Yoga Council. The Institut International de Yoga is a member of the International Yoga Federation and the European Yoga Alliance. Khane is regularly invited to perform yoga and give lectures or yoga lessons in international Yoga conferences throughout the world. Since 1973, he has participated many times in the annual conference organized in Zinal by the European Union of Yoga.See a photo entitled \\"Zinal (Suisse) : d√©monstration par le yogi Babacar Khane\\", in \\"Le yogi et le m√©decin\\", magazine L'Express, 30 sept. ‚Äì 6 oct. 1974, p. 55 G√©rard Blitz, important person in the field of yoga, wrote about him : \\"hombre cuya sola presencia es sugestiva, un Sabio aut√©ntico.\\"G√©rard Blitz, Prefacio de El Yoga de la Plegaria., p. 3. From 1978 to 1988, his yoga lessons were broadcast daily on Radio T√©l√©vision S√©n√©galaise (RTS). Several European TV channels (for example La Deuxi√®me Cha√Æne, called now France 2, 1972) invited him to take part in programmes about yoga or interviewed him (Algerian TV channel, Spanish and Greek TV channels). On the request of an Algerian Minister, Abdelmadjid Aouchiche, Director of DNC and former Dr Baumgartner's patient, Khane was asked by the Algerian state (though communist at this time) to introduce yoga in Algeria while training a team of yoga teachers, from 1978 to 1982.See the web page of one of these teachers / Khane's work and finds in the domain of Egyptian yoga are presented as reference in several academic publications.See M.

He is chief executive and founder of Community Leaders CIC,http://www.communityleaders.org.uk/ a community development agency, a Director of the Community Sector Coalition, a network for community groups in the British Isles, and an activist for Cornish devolution and the Cornish language. Early career Climo graduated with a science degree in 1983, and initially became involved in cot death research at Bristol University as part of the support team performing data mining activities. He moved into electronic publishing as well as the use of SGML, working initially for the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau. In 1996 he led the development of the first Cornish language web site, called The Cornish Language Advisory Service on behalf of Agan Tavas, a Cornish language group. He subsequently went on to chair that organisation between 1997 and 2004, a period of upheaval for the Cornish Language. Community development In 2005 Climo became involved in community development, developing the Inter-Link quality model, a system for developing community groups and providing a certification system for community development workers. This was supplemented by a Mental Health certification system in 2010. During 2009 he co-authored The Partnership Toolkit for community groups with co-worker Tom Jane. Climo became a Director of Community Leaders CIC in 2009 and the Community Sector Coalition during 2011. He also contributed to the founding of the National Community Activist's Network during that year. Cornish devolution Climo, a Cornish language speaker established the Cornish language journal An Gowsva, which he continued to edit until 2004. By 1996 the status of the language had become politically contentious: At that time the language was not recognised within the provisions of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, although Welsh and Scots Gaelic were. By 1999 Climo was a member of the Working Group for a Cornish Assembly led by Andrew George MP. From 2002 onwards he joined Bert Biscoe and Dick Cole on the steering group of the newly created 'Convention for a Cornish Assembly'. Both he and co-worker David Fieldsend developed detailed proposals for a devolved Cornish Assembly within the structure of the United Kingdom. In 2000 he was appointed Head of Research for the Cornwall Constitutional Convention. He then edited Devolution for One and All (pub. 2000). Following John Prescott's (then Deputy Prime Minister) policy to create directly elected English regional assemblies, Climo went on to edit The Case for Cornwall, again published by the Convention. From 2004 onwards, the campaign for a Cornish Development Agency became an increasingly important issue. This resulted in a further publication, Devolution for Prosperity, which set out the case for a strategic Development Agency for Cornwall along the lines of the Welsh Development Agency. The creation of a Development Agency for a devolved Cornwall is now mainstream policy and receives support from Cornish MPs. Cornish language Climo chaired Agan Tavas (The Campaign for the Cornish Language) from 1998 to 2005:Agan Tavas a difficult time for the language, with three competing written forms being promoted by each of the three main language groups. During this period Kernuak Es (Second Ed. Pub. Penzance 2004) a book for learners of the language was written by Climo. The orthography used is somewhere between Modern Cornish and Tudor Cornish orthographic forms. In 2003, and under pressure from a delegation by the Cornish Constitutional Convention, Nick Raynsford, the then Minister for Local Government reported that the government would include the Cornish language within the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. In 2004 a steering group was formed to develop a Strategy for the Cornish Language. This was unpopular with some, but a formal consultation of users and other interested parties in each of the six districts of Cornwall was finally held, culminating in the publication of a report for the Secretary of State for the Regions. During discussions within the Steering Group 2003 Climo and others proposed the idea of a Standard Written Form (SWF) as a means to unite the language movement. This proposal was eventually developed at two weekend-long sessions by an 'Ad Hoc Group', comprising representatives from the respective language groups, chaired by Trond Trusterud a language researcher, and supported by considerable ex officio work by several linguists. The first revision of the SWF was agreed in 2008 and provides a platform for using Cornish for official purposes and in education.

The Craftsman was a magazine founded by the American furniture designer Gustav Stickley that championed the American Arts and Crafts movement. History The Craftsman was founded by Stickley in October 1901. A key figure in the early years was art historian and Syracuse University professor Irene Sargent. She wrote most of the magazine's first three issues herself ‚Äîincluding the inaugural issue's cover story on William Morris ‚Äî and thereafter usually wrote each issue's lead article while acting as managing editor and layout designer. Her writings in The Craftsman, along with the architectural designs the magazine published, helped to shape public understanding of the American Arts and Crafts aesthetic and contributed greatly to the magazine's success. In 1904, Stickley moved the magazine to New York City and Sargent remained in Syracuse to write for other publications. The Craftsman put out its last issue in December 1916. The following year, it merged with Art World. Stickley's own home in Syracuse, New York, became the first home with an exclusive Craftsman interior. Views of its interior and plans were published in The Craftsman in 1903. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

Beck began his theatrical career with August Iffland and Johann David Beil at the Hoftheater (Court Theater) in Gotha and, like most of the ensemble, went to the Mannheim National Theater after the Hoftheater was disbanded in 1779. The National Theater was then blossoming artistically under the leadership of Wolfgang Heribert von Dalberg. While there, Beck took part in the premieres of Schiller's first plays Die R√§uber (as Kosinsky) and Fiesco (as Bourgognino). In 1799 Prince-Elector Maximilian IV. Joseph von Bayern called him to Munich as a director. He returned to Mannheim in 1801 as theater director, dying there in 1803. Beck was known for his acting skill and his good voice and acted with the same finesse in tragedies and comedies as in musicals. Among his own plays, the comedies Die Schachmaschine (Berlin 1798), Die Qu√§lgeister (Frankfurt 1802) and Das Kam√§leon (Frankfurt 1803) found the most acclaIm. His dramatic work appeared under the title \\"Theater\\" in three volumes in Frankfurt, beginning in 1802. Beck's first wife Karoline, n√©e Ziegler (born 3 January 1766 in Mannheim), also a talented, promising actress, debuted in Mannheim in 1781 but died on 24 July 1784. Friedrich Schiller, who had envisioned her to portray his Luise in Kabale und Liebe, displayed a particular fondness for her.

It involved the detonation of 1444 weapons, with a yield of 6559 megatons, and projected an American death toll of between 85 and 125 million. CRP-2B predicts a \\"countervalue\\" attack (an attack targeting cities instead of military and industrial infrastructure). The program was referred to as a \\"study\\", but in fact it was the product of a computer simulation. It was also the source of an 80% survival rate figure that was quoted by many people in the years afterwards. The 80% survival rate was an initial assumption, built into the parameters of the computer simulation by its designers. The assumption stems from the conditions of the scenario, with historical precedence in the Cuban Missile Crisis: FEMA assumes that the nuclear exchange would be preceded by 3‚Äì5 days of \\"heightened tensions\\" that would give Americans time to evacuate major cities. But as the program came to be a \\"study\\", so the survival rate figure came to be the \\"finding\\" of the study. Charles F. Estes Jr., director of strategic police at the Office of the Undersecretary of Defence for Policy, stated: This 80% figure was quoted in the 1980s by U.S. congresspeople and other officials.  Criticism  The 80% survival rate assumption has since came under significant criticism from academics and organizations like the Federation of American Scientists (FAS). FAS criticized CRP-2B for failing to consider the potential ecological impacts of nuclear war, including nuclear winter, disruptions to agriculture, and the radioactive contamination of water supplies. It further criticized CRP-2B for studying only direct and immediate consequences of the attacks, ignoring the long-term threats to human health posed by ionizing radiation and social problems caused by breakdowns in law and order, strife between relocated populations and host communities, and disruptions to the supply of medical equipment. Stanford University radiologist and anti-nuclear activist Herbert L. Abrams was particularly critical of the scenario's assumptions regarding the injured. He noted that hospitals would quickly be overwhelmed by the number of victims, particularly burn victims, who already face shortages of beds, medical personnel, and resources. Abrams estimated that because 80% of hospitals are in urban areas and would so be destroyed in the attack, there would 1 bed for every 563 severely injured patients. Hospitals would face similar post-attack shortages for blood, plasma, and other fluids and drugs and bandages, which would prevent effective treatment of the wounded and patients with chronic illnesses. Taking into account these impacts on medical facilities, Abrams estimates that only 60 million Americans would survive in the CRP-2B scenario, before nuclear winter, social strife, and disruptions to the food supply are considered.

The main customers of the El Paisano during the 1930s and 1940s were area cattle ranchers who came to Marfa to buy and sell their herds, and tourists who came to West Texas for the benefits of the dry desert air. In 1955, George Stevens and a Warner Bros film crew came to Presidio County to film Giant. The El Paisano Hotel served as base of operations for the months during which time the film was being shot in the surrounding countryside. Stevens stayed at the El Paisano Hotel as did the 300 plus members of the cast and crew who included: James Dean, Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, Sal Mineo, Chill Wills, and Jane Withers among others. The hotel began to go into decline in the 1960s and 1970s. El Paisano Properties Corp. bought the property in the late 1970s and converted the hotel's 65 rooms into 9 timeshare condominiums. Although 800 timeshare units were sold, the owners eventually abandoned the business and Presidio County foreclosed on the property for back taxes.

It has been a member since 1922. The Colombian Red Cross embraces the principles of the International Red Cross. It provides humanitarian aid to people in need of protection, protection of life and health during armed conflict and disaster relief during emergencies within the Colombian territory. The Colombian Red Cross has played a major humanitarian role within the Colombian Armed Conflict as a mediator in the area of Human rights.  History  Headquarters of Colombian Red Cross in Bogota The National Society of the Colombian Red Cross was founded in 1915. The idea of founding the Colombian Red Cross was first conceived by physician and member of the National Academy of Medicine Dr. Hipolito Machado and followed by pupil and physician Adriano Perdomo. Other original founders were entrepreneur Santiago Samper whom would initially sponsor it and also physicians Jose Maria Montoya and Nicolas Buendia. Some of the people mentioned above were participants in the Thousand Days War. They brought it upon themselves to use a horse-drawn carriage as an ambulance to transport victims in the battlefield. The society was recognized by the Colombian government in 1916 and it was recognized internationally by the International Red Cross in 1922. Currently it exists under Law 852 of 2003 which rules the scope of the activities of the Colombian Red Cross and under Law 875 of 2004 which regulates the use of the emblem.

The organization depends upon its donors and volunteers for its functionality and maintenance. Other than conventional charity donations and zakat funds the PWA also holds many fund raising campaigns such as bake sales and promotion in school campuses. Established in 1979, by three students of Dow Medical College, it soon transformed from being a small student based organization to a much larger movement with much coverage of their humanitarian deeds being publicized by means of local Television channels, Newspaper, Radio as well as their own newsletter which is circulated in their locality. History Patients' Welfare Association was established as a small student based organization by three students of Dow Medical College in 1979, with simple services such as free of cost drugs for needy patients. In the years to come the organization gained much popularity and by 1982 it had gained enough funds and volunteer force to form a blood bank and a Thalassemia Follow-up Clinic. With their influence spreading, in 1986 a diagnostic laboratory was set up. Services With the slogan \\"We feel, We serve,\\" their existence depends on service to the underprivileged segment of society. The organization achieves this by means of several departments which have been built within the vicinity of Civil Hospital, Karachi. =Blood bank= The Blood bank provides more than 350 units of blood daily on exchange basis not only to patients of Civil Hospital Karachi, but also extends its services to patients all over the city. All units dispatched are screened for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, Syphilis and Malarial Parasite, thus ensuring patient safety. The blood bank also provides blood components such as packed cells, platelets and fresh frozen plasma. The Blood Bank has also started the service of providing mega unit of platelets to patients of Civil Hospital Karachi, free of cost. =Thalassemia Services= Previously working under the 'Follow Up Clinics', PWA Thalassemia Services was upgraded to a separate department with the start of transfusion facility for registered Thalassemia patients in 2011. The department has got 260 registered patients suffering from Thalassemia, a hereditary blood disorder. These patients are receiving regular blood transfusions and consultations by a qualified Haematologist along with regular diagnostic investigations, Due to shortage of funds, only 60 registered patients are currently being provided with Iron chelation therapy. efforts are under-way to collect funds and start provision of Iron chelation therapy to all registered patients. The cost of treatment of one patients suffering from this lifelong disease is Pakistani Rs. 300,000 - Rs. 500,000 per annum depending upon the age and blood transfusion needs of the patient. PWA Thalassemia Services is providing all these facilities completely free of charge. Other events The Patients' Welfare Association holds many events; from fund raising activities to seminars concerning local medical issues. One of their main fund raising events is an annual ‚ÄòFood Mela', a bake sale of colossal magnitude, where funds more than one million rupees have been gathered in recent years.

The square is named for the former concert hall, the Odeon, on its northwestern side. The name Odeonsplatz has come to be extended to the parvis (forecourt) of the Residenz, in front of the Theatine Church and terminated by the Feldherrnhalle, which lies to the south of it. The square was the scene of a fatal gun battle which ended the march on the Feldherrnhalle during the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch. Location and buildings The Odeonsplatz is located north of the Old Town, on the border between Altstadt-Lehel (to the east) and Maxvorstadt (to the west). On the west side, which is set back from the line of the Ludwigstra√üe, are the building of the Odeon (1826‚Äì28, now the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior) and the identical Palais Leuchtenberg (1817‚Äì21, now the Bavarian State Ministry of Finance), both modelled on the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. On the east side is Klenze's Bazaar Building, including the Caf√© Tambosi. Between the two buildings on the west side, an unnamed street leads to the Palais Ludwig Ferdinand (1825‚Äì26, now the headquarters of Siemens). Both this street and the Brienner Stra√üe, which begins at the south end of the square, lead to the adjacent Wittelsbacherplatz, also designed by Klenze. The Feldherrnhalle is a copy of the famous Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence. The Odeonsplatz is served by the U Bahn station of the same name and by the Museenlinie (museum line) of the Munich bus system. Since 1972, the southern end of the square has been part of the central Munich pedestrian zone. History As early as 1790, plans were made in connection with the removal of the old city walls to replace the Schwabing Gate (Schwabinger Tor) with a new square and to make the beginning of the route from the Residenz to Nymphenburg Palace (the F√ºrstenweg, now Brienner Stra√üe) more impressive. The current form of the square and the parvis to the south of it was determined by King Ludwig I of Bavaria, who in 1816, while still Crown Prince, commissioned Klenze to lay out the whole of the Ludwigstra√üe, including the square at its southern end. The Italianate neo-classical style of the first building, the Palais Leuchtenberg, set the tone, and unlike earlier plans by Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell which had featured buildings surrounded by a parklike setting, Klenze created an enclosed urban square to better fit with the adjacent Old Town.Hans Lehmbruch, \\"Wie der Odeonsplatz entstand\\" , Bavarian Ministry of the Interior (PDF) Hans Lehmbruch, \\"Plans for Odeonsplatz (Odeon's Plaza) - A New Munich, 1800‚Äì1860\\", City of Munich However, the Feldherrnhalle, erected to close the view at the southern end on the site of the demolished gate,Hans A. Pohlsander, National Monuments and Nationalism in 19th Century Germany, New German-American studies 31, Oxford/New York: Lang, 2008, , p. 145. was commissioned from Klenze's rival Friedrich von G√§rtner in 1840‚Äì41. As the building of the square continued, the project expanded to include the new Ludwigstra√üe; originally it had been intended as a central square. As a result, the obelisk in memory of the Bavarian troops who had died fighting with Napoleon in his Russian campaign was instead erected in the Karolinenplatz in 1833. In 1862 an equestrian statue of Ludwig I was added at the mouth of the street between the Odeon and the Palais Leuchtenberg; it was designed by Ludwig von Schwanthaler and executed by Max von Widnmann.\\"Ludwig 1. und sein Isar-Athen\\" , Alchemia Spectrum 2, January 2000, pp. 5‚Äì9, p. 7 (PDF) The Odeonsplatz has traditionally been an important site of parades and public events, including funeral processions (most recently for Franz Josef Strauss in 1988), victory parades (most recently for the Bavarian troops who took part in the Franco- Prussian War of 1871), which proceeded down the Ludwigstra√üe to the Feldherrnhalle, with the VIP rostrum usually being located at the statue of Ludwig I. The annual parade to the Oktoberfest still follows this route. According to many historians, this traditional function was the reason for the Nazi march on the Feldherrnhalle on 9 November 1923 in the course of the Beer Hall Putsch, which ended in a gunfight in which four state police officers and 16 Nazis were killed. During the Third Reich, the annual memorial march passed through the square and continued to the K√∂nigsplatz, where the Nazi fallen had been interred. A memorial was erected for them to the east of the Feldherrnhalle, which all passersby were required to honour with the Hitler salute; this was demolished in 1945 and the four police officers remembered with a plaque in the pavement and in 2010 with one on the wall of the Residenz. The Odeonsplatz was also the subject of at least one painting by Hitler. Together with the Marienplatz, the Odeonsplatz remains an important site for both civic events and demonstrations.

Published after his breakthrough book Tropic of Cancer, Aller Retour New York takes the form of a long letter from Miller to his friend Alfred Perl√®s in Paris. In the book Miller describes his experiences on a trip back to New York City, his birthplace, in pursuit of his sometime lover Ana√Øs Nin, who had left Paris for New York in the company of psychoanalyst Otto Rank. When Nin returned to Paris after a few months, Miller did so as well, with this book as his record of the visit.Shaun O'Connell, Remarkable, Unspeakable New York: A Literary History (New York: Beacon Press, 1997), pp.219‚Äì220, excerpt available online at Google Books. Literary critic Shaun O'Connell describes the book as \\"a litany of [Miller's] disenchantment with America,\\" and Miller's view of New York as \\"the symbolic center of American corruption.\\" Miller paints an unpleasant picture of a New York that, in Miller's eyes, is distinctly inferior to Paris. The book contains many negative comments about women and New York's many ethnic groups, especially Jews, leading to concerns that the book was antisemitic.Gerald Stern, \\"Henry Miller's New York\\" in Stealing History (Trinity University Press, 2012), , pp. 270-272. Excerpts available at Google Books. In his preface to a later French translation, Miller noted that he had modified some of the book's \\"harsh, seemingly unjustified references to the Jews\\", which he explained as a function of his \\"extravagant and reckless\\" youthful prose.Robert Ferguson, Henry Miller: A Life (Faber & Faber, 2012), , p. 248. Excerpts available at Google Books. On the other hand, in a 1971 letter to his publisher, Miller rejected any charges of antisemitic content, although he also suggested delaying any reprint of the book while it \\"might rightly or wrongly create a bad impression\\".George Wickes, ed., Henry Miller and James Laughlin: Selected Letters (W.

A critic for the British newspaper The Independent commented on the book's \\"blustering misogyny\\" and \\"racial swipes of the kind common to much pre-war American literature\\" but also observed that it had \\"some arresting moments.\\"\\"Paperbacks: Sea Stories: New Writing from the National Maritime Museum; Wish Her Safe at Home; Aller Retour New York, By Henry Miller; The Private Lives of the Impressionists; Nobody's Home, By Dubravka Ugresic, The Independent on Sunday, October 14, 2007. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, critic Margot Mifflin described the book as a \\"springboard\\" for Miller's 1939 novel Tropic of Capricorn, \\"an uproarious critique of America\\" presaging Miller's 1945 book The Air-Conditioned Nightmare, and \\"a central document of Miller's picaresque life.\\"Margot Mifflin, Book Review: Aller Retour New York, Entertainment Weekly, January 17, 1992. Critic Gerald Stern found the book, and its bigotry, to be \\"an attack on any kind of social action, even on hope\\", in which Miller \\"seems actually to hate everything, or really not to love anything\\" except a few people he meets.

It is named for Mary Jane Thurston, a schoolteacher from Grand Rapids, Ohio who bequeathed of land for the establishment of a park. The park is along the Maumee River near the remains of the historic Miami and Erie Canal. Mary Jane Thurston State Park is open for year-round recreation including, hunting, fishing and boating, picnicking, camping and hiking. History Mary Jane Thurston State Park is along the Maumee river near Grand Rapids, OH. This area has played a key role in the history of northwest Ohio. The rivers provided a travel route for numerous Indian tribes including the Iroquois, Miami, Lenape, Ottawa, Erie, Wyandot, and Shawnee. Anglo-American explorers were also drawn to the rivers for many of the same reasons as the Native Americans. It provided a reliable source of water as well as an abundance of fish and game. President George Washington dispatched General Anthony Wayne and his army to the Northwest Territory to put down an Indian uprising, led by the Shawnee leader Blue Jacket. Wayne built Fort Defiance and defeated Blue Jacket at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. After the Native Americans were driven out and west, the land was opened to settlement by Anglo-Americans. Homesteaders arrived soon after. They cleared the land and began farming. The Miami and Erie and Wabash and Erie Canals passed through an area now included in the park. The canals connected the Ohio River with Lake Erie. Cities such as Defiance grew along the banks of the canal. They developed into trade and industrial centers. The canal system thrived for about thirty years in the mid to late 19th century before they were replaced the railroads. There were challenges keeping enough water in the canals during the 1840s. The state of Ohio built a large dam across the Maumee River at Gilead in 1845. This dam replaced a smaller dam that had been built to provide power to a mill. This act outraged the citizens of Gilead since the new dam restricted the water power provided to the mill. The upset residents of the community destroyed the dam. Following the destruction of the dam a side cut canal was built that connected Gilead with the main canal. This caused an economic boom in Gilead and the village was incorporated as Grand Rapids in 1855. The first of the Mary Jane Thurston State Park were donated by the park's namesake, Mary Jane Thurston. She was a teacher in Grand Rapids. Thurston donated her land in 1928 and over a period of 40 years land surrounding the Thurston plot was acquired. Mary Jane Thurston, which is , was opened to the public in 1968. Geography Mary Jane Thurston State Park is in the Maumee Valley. This valley was formerly covered by Lake Maumee which was a remnant of the last ice age. The lake stretched from what is now Fort Wayne, Indiana to western New York state. The waters from Lake Maumee eventually shifted creating Lake Erie and the Maumee Valley was formed. The Maumee Valley has been changed tremendously since it was settled after the Northwest Indian War. It was in the middle of the Great Black Swamp which was 30 to wide and about long. It was a heavily forested area that was home to massive sycamore trees that were converted into barns and in some cases homes. Oak and tulip trees were mixed in with the sycamore and walnut. Nearly every tree was cut in less than 100 years after the settlement of Ohio. The Maumee Valley was one of the last areas of Ohio to be cleared. The swampy ground made it difficult for settlers to enter. The swamp was drained between 1859 and 1875 with a series of ditches and drains. Nearly of land were cleared after the swamps were emptied. The region was covered with farms, as it is today, by 1885. Only six percent of the Maumee Valley is now covered with forests, some of this land is in Mary Jane Thurston State Park and up and down the Maumee River from the park. Recreation Mary Jane Thurston State Park is open for year-round recreation. There are 35 campsites at the park. All campsites come equipped with picnic tables and fire rings. There is a public restroom facility in the camping area. The Maumee River is open to all types of boating with two launch ramps at the park. Hunting and fishing are both permitted at the park. Common game animals include white-tailed deer and wild turkeys. The river is home to a variety of fresh water fish species including, northern pike, bullhead catfish, smallmouth bass and crappie. All hunters and anglers must have a valid license issued by the state. Numerous picnic tables are spread throughout the park. The Buckeye Trail passes through Mary Jane Thurston State Park for one mile (1.6 km).

The station was located on Wilmslow Road, just north of the junction with Barlow Moor Road and opposite Didsbury Library. Nothing now remains of the old station buildings, which have been demolished, but the surviving white Portland stone clock tower is a local landmark. Didsbury is now served by Didsbury Village tram stop which is close to the site of the former railway station. History Midland Railway lines into Manchester showing the Manchester South District Line In 1873, the Manchester South District Railway obtained permission to construct a new railway line from Manchester to Alderley. The company fell into financial difficulty and was eventually bought out by the Midland Railway in 1877, who went on to build the line. Construction began in 1878 and the line ‚Äî including Didsbury Station ‚Äî opened to passenger service on 1 January 1880, running from the new Manchester Central Station through south Manchester suburbs to . The line ran south through Didsbury via a cutting, passing underneath Wilmslow Road. Didsbury Station was situated on the east side of Wilmslow Road, set back from the road with a small forecourt area. The station building was a red brick Gothic Revival house with a booking office, ladies' and gentlemen's waiting rooms and an adjacent station master's house. There were two platforms in the cutting with glass canopies and a footbridge. Didsbury was served initially by the South District Service commuter route, and from August 1880 by express trains running from Manchester Central to . Didsbury's location on the network ensured frequent services. From 1901 the MR opened a new route to via and peak-time services through Didsbury reached over 38 trains per hour in each direction. Direct services operated between Didsbury and destinations such as , and the Peak District. Around 1910, a memorial clock was erected in the station forecourt dedicated to local philanthropist John Milson Rhodes (1847-1909). The clock tower is built of Portland stone in an Edwardian Baroque style and incorporates a pair of drinking fountains. On one side there is a bronze plaque which displays a relief medallion portrait of Rhodes and the inscription . From 1923, the MR was absorbed into the LMS, and after 1948 the line became part of British Rail. In the postwar period, while the South District Service declined in frequency, Manchester Central-London express services increased, although the new Blue Pullmans did not call at Didsbury but at instead. =Closure= When the former LNWR line from became the principal route for London express trains, the South District Line lost its importance; the route and its stations were listed for closure in the Beeching cuts. The last train to depart from Didsbury was the 18:45 express to London St Pancras on 2 January 1967. Passenger express and freight trains continued to run through Didsbury until the line was fully closed in 1969. The station building remained standing for a number of years and was used as a hardware store, Didsbury Station Hardwre. After the store closed, the building fell derelict and was demolished in 1982. =Line re-opening= The former site of Didsbury Station with the clock on Wilmslow Road The former South District Line lay derelict for several decades. In 1984, Greater Manchester Council and GMPTE announced the Project Light Rail scheme to develop a new light rail/tram system by re-opening use of disused railway lines in the region, including the route through Didsbury. The first phase of the Manchester Metrolink system opened in 1992, but it was not until 2013 that the network was expanded to reach Didsbury. Tram tracks were laid along the former trackbed, but as Didsbury station had been demolished over 30 years earlier, it was decided to locate the new Didsbury Village tram stop further down the line on School Lane. Nothing remains today of the old Midland Railway station building, and the site today is occupied by a row of shops and pubs. The station clock is still standing and is a local landmark.

Early life Michael Agnethler was born to an aristocratic Transylvanian Saxon family of Hermannstadt (now Sibiu, Romania). The Agnethlers had been of a long, prestigious history, with many local socialites in the region. The name of the family originated from the Saxon town of Agnetheln. Michael Agnethler was the only son of his family. The father was the principal of a gymnasium. Just after Michael's birth, his father was appointed pastor of Gierelsau (Bradu), so the family moved there, where Michael spent his childhood, then returning to Sibiu to attend school. Michael Agnethler had been of a weak physical constitution, with difficulty sleeping. An anecdote is known, where Agnethler was frightened in his sleep by a fellow student‚Äîwho jokingly mumbled \\"swim, you're drowning\\" into his ears‚Äîwith Agnethler amidst a nightmare, moving his arms frantically like swimming. Career Agnethler started his studies of theology at the University of Halle in 1742; other interests included Ancient Rome antiquities and numismatics. Additionally, his physical frailness led him to start studying Medicine. Agnethler eventually earned a Doctorate of Philosophy in 1750, and of Medicine in 1751. Also in that year, he was given a position at the Akademie der Naturforscher, and soon afterwards became lecturer in Rhetoric, Antiquities, and Poetry at the University of Helmstedt. However, he suffered a severe tuberculosis infection, and died soon thereafter, in 1752. Michael Gottlieb Agnethler is also known as an entomologist. Works He published a number of works on botany (mostly commentaries on Linnaeus) and on numismatics, the latter including descriptions of the coin collections of Johann Heinrich Schulze and Martin Schmeizel. * Nvmophylacivm Schvlzianvm Digessit, Descripsit Et Perpetvis Insigniorvm Rei Nvmariae Scriptorvm Commentariis Illvstratvm Edidit Michael Gottlieb Agnethler ; Pars Prior.

The movie, set in World War II India, tells the story of the murder trial of an American Army officer who killed a British soldier. Mitchum plays Lieut. Col. Barney Adams, who has been assigned as the accused man's defense counsel. The film is also known as The Winston Affair, the title of the novel the film was based on, which was written by Howard Fast. Plot Friction develops between American and British troops stationed in India during World War II and fights break out between the troops when, in 1944, American 2nd Lieutenant Winston (Keenan Wynn) shoots unarmed British Staff Sergeant Quinn (Bill Mitchell) several times, seemingly without provocation, in front of 11 witnesses. American General Kempton (Barry Sullivan) assigns Lieutenant Colonel Barney Adams (Robert Mitchum) to defend Winston at his court-martial because, even though everyone thinks it is an open-and-shut case, the general wants Adams to put up a vigorous defense. He is to make it clear that the verdict is not simply a sop to reduce tensions between the two armies before an offensive against the real enemy. Adams later finds out that Winston's brother-in-law, a Congressman, has been applying pressure. The Army Lunacy Commission has found Winston fit and sane; Adams is informed by nurse Kate Davray (France Nuyen) that Colonel Burton (Alexander Knox), who headed the lunacy commission, refused to accept the report (which he destroyed) of the hospital's psychiatric head, Major Kaufman (Sam Wanamaker), who believes Winston is a psychopath. Burton is anxious to have Winston convicted and hanged to patch the strained relations between the two forces. Adams instructs Kaufman to bring his report to the trial but when Burton is informed of this order he transfers Kaufman to a distant hospital. Adams visits British Major Kensington (Trevor Howard), a qualified psychiatrist who also considers Winston to be psychopathic but has been warned not to interfere. Kensington believes Winston killed Quinn out of a feeling of victimization because Quinn, a sergeant, had the same duties as Winston, a lieutenant. During a brief love affair, nurse Kate Davray gives an unsigned photocopy of Major Kaufman's report to Colonel Adams which at first Adams refuses to accept. Winston, in an interview with Adams, raves that he killed Quinn for defiling the white race by consorting with a black woman. Though he despises Winston, Adams refuses to rig the trial and he holds back his defense, waiting for Kaufman to arrive as a witness. When he learns that Kaufman has been killed in a jeep accident on the way to the trial, Adams calls Kensington to the stand after establishing that no member of the lunacy commission is a qualified psychiatrist, to authenticate the unsigned photocopy of Major Kaufman's report. As Kensington describes Winston's mental illness to the court, Winston cracks and begins raving. Adams wins his case and spends a few days of peace and happiness with nurse Davray before leaving the area. The friction between the troops is eased and they prepare to enter battle in complete unity.

The railway station was closed in 1967 as part of the Beeching cuts and was demolished in 1982, and the old railway line lay derelict for several decades. In 1984, Greater Manchester Council and GMPTE announced the Project Light Rail scheme to develop a new light rail/tram system by re-opening use of disused railway lines in the region, including the route through Didsbury. The first phase of the Manchester Metrolink system opened in 1992, but it was not until 2013 that the network was expanded to reach Didsbury, as part of Phase 3b of the Metrolink expansion project.

The Lessons of Terror: A History of Warfare Against Civilians: Why It Has Always Failed and Why It Will Fail Again. Random House, Inc. is a military strategy in which only enemy combatants are targeted, and non-combatants killed or wounded by collateral damage are kept to a minimum. Its principles were established by Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius, who is considered to be a founder of international law, in his book De jure belli ac pacis libri tres (\\"On the Law of War and Peace: Three Books\\"), published in 1625. A successful practitioner was Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, as chief of staff of the Prussian Army in the 19th century. The opposite of progressive war is unlimited war, which includes civilians as legitimate targets. Unlimited war uses military action against civilians, in the hope of undermining the will to fight by the people and their leaders so that they end their resistance. Examples of unlimited war are cluster bombs, the firebombing of Dresden, the German bombing of British cities during the Blitz, the firebombing of Tokyo and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The philosophy of unlimited war is controversial. Many consider it a form of terrorism in the sense of deliberately attacking noncombatants in the hope of changing their mindset. Such ambiguities between unlimited warfare and terrorist strategies could be the source of why many terrorist groups consider themselves honourable fighters, and many consider the US military to be terrorists. Guerrilla warfare can be considered progressive if it is only enemy combatants that are targeted, but it becomes terrorism when noncombatants are targeted.

The documentary features original interviews with notable Indian film stars, including Zeenat Aman, Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, and Hema Malini.

The station was built by the Newcastle and District Electric Lighting Company in 1902, near their Forth Banks Power Station. Specification and operation The station was of a steel frame and brick clad construction with the boiler house and turbine hall built alongside each other, a modern design at the time. The station had no rail sidings and so instead coal was brought to it by cart from the colliery. Coal was also delivered by barge, via a nearby boat landing on the River Tyne. The coal-fired five Stirling boilers, each with 600 HP capacity. Two further boilers were installed in 1907. Coal was fed into the boilers by overhead hoppers, which used automatic stokers. Conveyor belts were used to transport coal to the boilers, and to take ash away from them. The station initially used one Parsons steam turbine to drive two 500 kilowatt (kW) dynamos, giving the station a total generating capacity of 1,000 kW. However, by 1907 the station had been extended to generate using two DC Parsons 1,500 kW sets, fitted with vacuum augmenters, and a further two 1,000 kW generators. This gave the station a total generating capacity of 5,000 kW. Condensing water was pumped directly from the River Tyne, which it was situated upon. 1,540 customers would come to the power station's shops to have their meters tested and repaired. History The station was built after the neighbouring Forth Banks Power Station required frequent expansion, as demand grew. It was built on a large adjacent piece of land. During the Second World War there was a suspected unexploded bomb found in a coal dump at the station, however it was discredited. The station continued operating until roughly 1948, when the UK's electrical supply industry was nationalised. The station has since been demolished, and an electric substation now stands on the site.

History The C17 class was introduced as an improved version of the C16 class. Per Queensland Railway's classification system they were designated the C16 class, C representing they had four driving axles, and 17 representing the cylinder diameter in inches. The design was so successful that 227 locomotives were built from 1920 when the first engine N¬∫ 15 entering service through until 1953 when N¬∫ 1000 was delivered. The Commonwealth Railways NM class were of the same design. They were used to haul Mail trains on lines could not accommodate heavier B18¬º class, also suburban passenger, mixed, goods and branch line trains. Until 1948 they were the heaviest engines that could work north of Mackay. Prior to the introduction of diesel electric locomotives, they were responsible for hauling the air-conditioned Inlander, Midlander and Westlander trains for parts of their respective journeys. First engines had large steam domes, open cabs and C16 style tenders. Those built from 1938 onwards, commencing with N¬∞858, had small steam domes, sedan cabs with welded tenders and also larger diameter () piston valves. The two types of boilers were occasionally interchanged at overhauls and by later years most of the old style ones had been replaced. The last 40 engines, N¬∫961 to N¬∫1000, were fitted with Timken roller bearings and painted brown. They acquired the nickname of Brown Bombers after American boxer Joe Louis. Those overhauled in the last years of steam operations were repainted black. A number of modifications were carried out over their life including the fitting of large mushroom air snifting valves. Several had additional sandboxes and/or rear headlights fitted at various times for working lines where no turning facilities were available. On 5 May 1947, C17 class locomotive 824 left the rails near Camp Mountain on the Dayboro line claiming the lives of 16 people and 38 injured. The Commonwealth Department of Trade & Customs Recreation and Social Club had chartered the train for a picnic at Closeburn. Negotiating a sharp curve at excessive speed caused the tragedy. The locomotive was repaired and continued in service until May 1967 when it was transferred to Injune along the recently closed line.

The overlanding trip was successful. Hepburn met up with Captain John Coghill and his brother William. The brothers were settled at Kirkham and Stathellen near Braidwood, New South Wales. In 1837, Hepburn and William Coghill became partners in a plan to overland 1400 ewes, 50 rams and 200 wethers to central Victoria. On 15 January 1838, the party left Strathallen for Victoria. Shortly after leaving Gundagai, New South Wales, they met William Bowman and the three parties travelled southward, crossing the Murray River near Albury. The Major's (Major Mitchell) tracks were picked up near Wangaratta and followed to Mount Alexander, where they set up a lambing camp in April. Bowman stayed, establishing the Sutton Grange run, but leaving it for Jas Orr when he moved on to Stratford near Heathcote. Smeaton Hill Run Mount Kooroocheang, an extinct volcano in Victoria, Australia. Hepburn had hoped to settle on the country he had passed through in 1836 but found it was all taken. From Mount Alexander, Hepburn sited Mount Kooroocheang, and the Major's Mammaloid Hills. The party moved on to establish the Smeaton Hill Run on 15 April 1838. William Coghill travelled further west, crossing Bullarook Creek and establishing Glendaruel and then Glendonald. Captain Hepburn named Smeaton Hill station after a small hamlet which lay near his birthplace. The homestead which he named Smeaton House, was constructed in 1849-50 and is occupied today. Hepburn founded the rural town of Smeaton and the town of Hepburn Springs is named after him. John Hepburn died in 1860 aged 57 and he was buried with other members of his family in a small cemetery on the property. Smeaton House was purchased by the Righetti family and is sometimes open to the public.

She was the sister ship to MS Augustus. The ship was later transferred to the new Italian Line after the merger of Navigazione Generale Italiana. History Following the end of World War I, many shipping companies were waiting to have enough money to build new liners. Navigazione Generale Italiana ordered two new 30,000 gross tons transatlantic ocean liners from Ansaldo shipyard. The first ship was launched in 1926 and christened Roma. She had an entirely steel hull. Her interior was decorated in Baroque style. The ship was with signal code letters ICEV. The Roma, unlike MS Augustus, her sister ship, which was powered by diesel engines, was powered by eight turbines connected in couples to four shafts, and whose steam was provided by 9 double ended and 4 single ended boilers for a total of 13. The ship was rated for a speed of 22 knots. The ship could house 1700 passengers (375 first, 300 second, 300 intermediate, 700 third class). Her two funnels were repainted into the Italian Line's colors after her company merged with Lloyd Sabaudo and Cosulich Line to form the new Italian Line. In 1933 the intermediate class was replaced by the touristic one. The main deck was covered with teak. On 30 January 1932, Roma rammed the American ocean liner at New York, severely damaging President Roosevelt. President Roosevelt was repaired and returned to service. =Conversion to aircraft carrier= When World War II broke out, she was laid up and later taken over by the Italian Navy. She was then refitted and transformed into an aircraft carrier named Aquila. Her speed was increased to 30 knots after the refitting. She was taken over by the German occupation forces in 1943 but was partially scuttled by Italian Co-belligerents two years later. After the end of the conflict, her wreckage was raised and towed to La Spezia, where she was scrapped in 1951‚Äì1952.

The plant is native to the western part of the Mediterranean Basin in Europe and Northern Africa and is widely naturalized throughout most of the world, including all of North America. It was probably introduced into North America by a contaminant crop seed. The plant grows in soils of all textures, even sand. The plant germinates in winter or early spring. The blooming time is lengthy, and after maturity the plant forms a tumbleweed. Common names of the plant include Jim Hill mustard, after James J. Hill, a Canadian-American railroad magnate, tall tumblemustard, tall mustard, tumble mustard, tumbleweed mustard, tall sisymbrium, and tall hedge mustard. Description Tumble mustard forms a tall (up to 5 ft) but delicate-looking plant, with slender, much-branched stems. Its stem leaves are divided into thin, linear lobes, while the basal leaves are broader and pinnately compound. The flowers are inconspicuous and only 1/4 inch wide. They have four usually yellow petals and four narrow, curved sepals. The seedpods are slender and long (2-4 inches). At maturity it dies, uproots, and tumbles in the wind, spreading its seeds.

The peak of such a fold is called a gyrus (plural: gyri), and its trough is called a sulcus (plural: sulci). The neurons of the cerebral cortex reside in a thin layer of gray matter, only 2‚Äì4 mm thick, at the surface of the brain. Much of the interior volume is occupied by white matter, which consists of long axonal projections to and from the cortical neurons residing near the surface. Gyrification allows a larger cortical surface area and hence greater cognitive functionality to fit inside a smaller cranium. In most mammals, gyrification begins during fetal development. Primates, cetaceans, and ungulates have extensive cortical gyri, with a few species exceptions, while rodents generally have none. Gyrification in some animals, for example the ferret, continues well into postnatal life.  Gyrification during human brain development  Human cortical development. As fetal development proceeds, gyri and sulci begin to take shape with the emergence of deepening indentations on the surface of the cortex. Not all gyri begin to develop at the same time. Instead, the primary cortical gyri form first (beginning as early as gestational week 10 in humans), followed by secondary and tertiary gyri later in development. One of the first and most prominent sulci is the lateral sulcus (also known as the lateral fissure or Sylvian fissure), followed by others such as the central sulcus, which separates the motor cortex (precentral gyrus) from somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus). Most cortical gyri and sulci begin to take shape between weeks 24 and 38 of gestation, and continue to enlarge and mature after birth.  Evolutionary advantages  One advantage of gyrification is thought to be increased speed of brain cell communication, since cortical folds allow for cells to be closer to one other, requiring less time and energy to transmit neuronal electrical impulses, termed action potentials. There is evidence to suggest a positive relationship between gyrification and cognitive information processing speed, as well as better verbal working memory. Additionally, because a large cranium requires a larger pelvis during childbirth, with implied difficulty in bipedalism, a smaller cranium is more easily delivered.  Theories on causality in gyrification Mechanical buckling = The mechanisms of cortical gyrification are not well understood, and several hypotheses are debated in the scientific literature. A popular hypothesis dating back to the time of Retzius in the late 19th century asserts that mechanical buckling forces due to the expanding brain tissue cause the cortical surface to fold. Many theories since have been loosely tied to this hypothesis. An external growth constraint of the cranium is not thought to cause gyrification. This is principally because the primordium of the cranium during the period of fetal brain development is not yet ossified (hardened into bone through calcification). The tissue covering the embryonic cerebral cortex is several thin layers of ectoderm (future skin) and mesenchyme (future muscle and connective tissue, including the future cranium). These thin layers grow easily along with cortical expansion but eventually the cranial mesenchyme differentiates into cartilage; ossification of the cranial plates does not occur until later in development. The human cranium continues to grow substantially along with the brain after birth until the cranial plates finally fuse after several years. Experimental studies in animals have furthermore shown that cortical folding can occur without external constraints. Cranial growth is thus thought to be driven by brain growth; mechanical and genetic factors intrinsic to the brain are now thought to be the primary drivers of gyrification. The only observed role that the cranium may play in gyrification is in flattening of gyri as the brain matures after the cranial plates fuse. = Axonal tension = An alternative theory suggests that axonal tension forces between highly interconnected cortical areas pull local cortical areas towards each other, inducing folds. This model has been criticised: A numerical computer simulation could not produce a biologically realistic folding pattern. One study showed that gyrification can be experimentally induced in the embryonic mouse, but at early stages in the absence of axonal connections. = Differential tangential expansion = More recently, the theory of differential tangential expansion has been proposed, stating that folding patterns of the brain are a result of different tangential expansion rates between different cortical areas. This is proposed to be due to areal differences in early progenitor division rates.  Mechanical factors  Cortical thickness = Early conditions of the brain have a strong influence on its final level of gyrification. In particular, there is an inverse relationship between cortical thickness and gyrification. Areas of the brain with low values of thickness are found to have higher levels of gyrification. The reverse is also true, that areas of the brain with high values of thickness are found to have lower levels of gyrification. = Growth speed = There is some dispute over the growth rates through which cortical and subcortical layers of the brain develop. Purely isotropic growth suggests that the grey (outer shell) and white matter (inner core) layers each grow at separate rates, that are uniform in all dimensions. Tangential growth suggests that the grey matter grows at a faster rate than the inner white matter, and that the growth rate of the grey matter determines the growth rate of the white matter. Though both methods are differential, with the cortex growing more rapidly than the subcortex, tangential growth has been suggested as a more plausible model. Creases on the brain's surface are formed as a result of instability, and tangential growth models reach levels of instability that cause creasing more frequently than isotropic models. This level is called a critical point, at which, the models prefer to release potential energy by destabilizing and forming creases to become more stable.  Genetic factors  The pattern of cortical gyri and sulci is not random; most of the major convolutions are conserved between individuals and are also found across species. This reproducibility may suggest that genetic mechanisms can specify the location of major gyri. Studies of monozygotic and dizygotic twins of the late 1990s support this idea, particularly with regards to primary gyri and sulci, whereas there is more variability among secondary and tertiary gyri. Therefore, one may hypothesize that secondary and tertiary folds could be more sensitive to genetic and environmental factors. The first gene reported to influence gyrification was Trnp1. Local expression levels of Trnp1, can determine the future position of developing folds/gyri in human brains. Genes that influence cortical progenitor dynamics, neurogenesis and neuronal migration, as well as genes that influence the development of cortical circuits and axonal projections may all contribute to gyrification. Trnp1 is a DNA-binding factor that has been shown to regulate other genes that regulate the proliferation of cortical progenitor cells - thereby serving as a master gene-regulator. In addition, the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)- and sonic hedgehog (SHH)-signaling pathways have recently been reported to be able to induce cortical folds, with a full complement of cortical layers, in mice that live to adulthood. These FGF and Shh factors regulate cortical stem cell proliferation and neurogenesis dynamics. Roles for beta-catenin (part of the Wnt pathway) and appropriate levels of cell death of cortical progenitors have also been found.  Cell biological determinants  Cortical stem cells, known as radial glial cells (RGC)s, reside in the ventricular zone and generate the excitatory glutamatergic neurons of the cerebral cortex. These cells rapidly proliferate through self-renewal at early developmental stages, expanding the progenitor pool and increasing cortical surface area. At this stage, the pattern of cortical areas is genetically programmed by a system of signaling centers through the process of cortical patterning, and the primordial map of cortical functional areas at this stage is called a 'protomap'. Cortical neurogenesis begins to deplete the pool of progenitor cells, subject to the influences of many genetic cues such as fibroblast growth factors (FGF)s and Notch. RGCs generate intermediate neuronal precursors that divide further in the subventricular zone (SVZ), amplifying the number of cortical neurons being produced. The long fibers of RGCs project all the way through the developing cortex to the pial surface of the brain, and these fibers serve as physical guides for neuronal migration. A second class of RGC, termed basal RGCs (bRGC)s, forms a third progenitor pool in the outer SVZ. Basal RGCs are generally much more abundant in higher mammals. Both classic RGCs and the recently described bRGCs represent guiding cues that lead newborn neurons to their destination in the cortex. Increased numbers of bRGCs increase the density of guiding fibers in an otherwise fanning out array which would lose fiber density. The scientific literature points to differences in the dynamics of proliferation and neuronal differentiation in each of these progenitor zones across mammalian species, and such differences may account for the large differences in cortical size and gyrification among mammals. One hypothesis suggests that certain progenitor cells generate abundant neurons destined for the outer cortical layers, causing greater surface area increase in the outer layers compared with the inner cortical layers. It remains unclear how this may work without further mechanistic elements.  Variation across species  A 'gyrification index' (GI) has been used as a measure of the magnitude of cortical convolutions on the surface of the mammalian brain. Reptile and bird brains do not show gyrification. Mammals with a high GI are generally larger than those with a low GI; for example the pilot whale and bottlenose dolphin show the highest GI values. The human brain, while larger than that of a horse, shows a similar GI. Rodents generally show the lowest GIs. Nonetheless, some rodents show gyrencephaly and a few primate species are quite lissencephalic. A linear relation between mammals expressed in gyrification terms has been found by Mota & Herculano-Houzel, 2015. They suggest a model that combines morphometric measurements (Cortical Thickness, Exposed Area, and Total Area) which could be a way to describe gyrification.  Neurological disorders of gyrification  Lissencephaly = A cerebral cortex lacking surface convolutions is said to be lissencephalic, meaning 'smooth-brained'. During embryonic development, all mammalian brains begin as lissencephalic structures derived from the neural tube. Some, like mouse brains, remain lissencephalic throughout adulthood. It has been shown that lissencephalic species possess many of the molecular cues needed to achieve gyrencephaly, but a large variety of genes are involved in the regulation of the neural progenitor proliferation and neurogenic processes that underlie gyrification. It is hypothesized that spatiotemporal differences in these molecular pathways, including FGF, Shh, and Trnp1 and likely many others, determine the timing and extent of gyrification in various species. Lissencephaly is a human disease state. For humans with lissencephaly, a large portion of neurons fail to reach the outer cortex during neuronal migration, and remain under the cortical plate. This displacement results in not only defects in cortical connections, but also a thickened cortex, consistent with the idea that a brain with a thicker cortex will have a lesser degree of gyrification. = Polymicrogyria = Polymicrogyria is a condition in which the brain has an overly convoluted cortex. Though at the surface, the brain appears smooth with a few sulci, looking at the interior of the brain reveals a convoluted structure with a large number of secondary and tertiary folds. Brain imaging with MRI reveals a brain with polymicrogyria to have a thin cortex, consistent with the idea that a brain with a thin cortex will have a high level of gyrification. A wide array of genes when mutated have been shown to cause Polymicrogyria in humans, ranging from mTORopathies (e.g. AKT3) to channelopathies (sodium channels, \\"SCN3A\\"). = Autism = Patients with autism have overall higher levels of cortical gyrification, but only in the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes, as well as part of the cingulate cortex. The higher levels of gyrification are found to relate to greater local connectivity in autistic brains, suggesting hyperconnectivity. Trnp1, which was able to induce gyrification in animal models, has been hypothesized to be associated with disorders of gyrification in some cases of autism, but a review in 2012 found only one reported case of a mutation, in a patient with Rett syndrome (not ASD). The folds of autistic human brains are found to experience slight shifts in location, early in brain development. Specifically, different patterns appear in the superior frontal sulcus, Sylvian fissure, inferior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and olfactory sulci. These areas relate to working memory, emotional processing, language, and eye gaze, and their difference in location and level of gyrification when compared to a neurotypical human brain could explain some altered behaviors in autistic patients. = Schizophrenia = A more prevalent condition, schizophrenia, has been associated with structural abnormalities in the brain as well. Like autistic brains, schizophrenic brains show reduced cortical thickness and increased gyrification when compared to healthy brains. = Zika virus malformations = Cortical malformations induced by the Zika virus are due to infection during pregnancy, and are generally classified as microcephaly, or 'small-brain'. Due to the large reduction in volume of the cerebral cortex in microcephaly, changes in gyrification are not unexpected. However, recent studies of the mechanism of Zika malformations indicate that the principal defect is due to infection of RGCs and subsequent cell death. Death of cortical stem cells causes the loss of all expected daughter cells, and the scope of the malformation thus depends on the timing of infection as well as its severity during the schedule of neural stem cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Earlier infections would generally be expected to produce a more severe malformation. The microcephaly and gyrification malformations are permanent and there are no known treatments. Measurements of gyrification Cortical Gyrification can be measured in terms of the Gyrification Index (GI), Fractal Dimensionality and a combination of morphometric terms (Area, Thickness, Volume). The GI is defined as the ratio between the Total Area and the Exposed Area (\\"perimeter of the brain delineated on two-dimensional coronal sections\\"). FreeSurfer, a surface reconstruction Software is one of the tools available to measure the GI.

In the aftermath of the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763) that had ravaged the country Prussian King Frederick the Great introduced the Pfandbrief system with a ‚Äùcabinets-order‚Äù to ease credit shortage for the nobility. Based on his royal decree, Prussia set up so-called ‚ÄùLandschaften,‚Äù compulsory public-law associations of noble landowners, within the individual provinces. To refinance loans to their members Landschaften issued debentures that largely correspond with the present-day mortgage Pfandbrief since the creditor acquired a direct claim over the estates the member had pledged as security. This Pfandbrief system rapidly spread throughout all of Europe. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, it was widely adopted for the refinancing of public sector loans. The second decisive boost to the development of the Pfandbrief occurred when Landschaften outside Prussia started issuing Pfandbriefe for which all the properties lent against by the Landschaft served jointly as security. As before the loans raised by the Landschaften were not paid out in cash, but in Pfandbriefe. In 1862, the first German mortgage bank, Frankfurter Hypothekenbank in Frankfurt am Main, opened its doors. Numerous other mortgage banks followed in rapid succession in almost all German federal states. By the beginning of the twentieth century 40 private mortgage banks existed. Mortgage banks concentrated from the outset on real estate financing. The rapidly expanding towns and cities in the area of industrialization were in need of the housing construction and commercial properties financing. The 1900 Mortgage Bank Act (HBG) is deemed pioneering legislation until today. It provided a legally prescribed, uniform organizational framework for this group of credit institutions. It was in force for more than a century until the Pfandbrief Act entered into force in 2005 (source: Association of German Pfandbrief Banks). German Pfandbrief legislation The Pfandbrief Act (Pfandbriefgesetz), established in 2005 and amended in 2009, regulates the Pfandbrief. While most European countries have covered bond legislation, the United States and UK initially preferred non- legislative guidelines. The 2005 Pfandbrief Act increased potential issuers to include all licensed credit institutions that meet certain requirements. Formerly, only specialized private mortgage banks and public sector banks could issue covered bonds in Germany. The Pfandbrief Act supersedes all prior existing Pfandbrief legislations. The 2009 amendment introduced the Aircraft Pfandbrief as the fourth Pfandbrief type. Pfandbrief characteristics In their cover business, Pfandbrief banks grant property finance, public sector, ship and aircraft loans. Pfandbriefe have an average maturity of about five to seven years. While Pfandbriefe tend to be associated with asset-backed securities they are fundamentally different. Pfandbrief cover-assets remain on the bank's balance sheet. By contrast, asset-backed securities are typically off-balance-sheet transactions. Another difference: Pfandbrief cover pools are dynamic. Their composition can and usually does change over time, depending on the maturities and on the newly registered cover assets. Due to the stringent legal provisions that govern their issuance Pfandbriefe are deemed particularly safe. An independent cover pool trustee appointed by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) records cover assets and cover asset replacements in the cover register. In the event of the Pfandbrief issuer's insolvency, Pfandbrief investors have a preferential claim on the cover assets in the cover register because cover pool assets are not included in insolvency proceedings. There has not been a Pfandbrief default since 1901. Property financings may be included in the cover pool only up to 60% of the prudently calculated mortgage lending value. The same holds true for ship and aircraft financings. Public sector loans are 100% eligible for cover.German Pfandbrief Association The German covered bond market Pfandbrief issuers use pfandbriefe to fund loans that are secured by real estate liens, ship or aircraft mortgages or claims against public-sector bodies. Depending on the type of collateralization, these bonds are referred to as Mortgage Pfandbrief (), Public Pfandbrief (), Ship Pfandbrief () or Aircraft Pfandbrief (). Pfandbrief issuers have three different pfandbrief segments at their disposal: Jumbo pfandbriefe, traditional pfandbriefe and registered pfandbriefe. For the actual placement issuers have the choice between private placements and public offering. With a volume outstanding of EUR 806 billion, the Pfandbrief held a leading place in the European bond markets at year-end 2008. Pfandbriefe made up 22 percent of the German bond market in 2008: 71.9 percent of pfandbriefe were public pfandbriefe, 27.0% Mortgage Pfandbriefe and 1.1% Ship Pfandbriefe. The first Aircraft Pfandbriefe were expected to be issued in 2010. Pfandbrief- like securities have been introduced in more than 25 European countries ‚Äì and in recent years also in the United States of America and other countries outside Europe ‚Äì each with their own unique law and regulations. Today, continental Europe's covered bond market is well established. Initially primarily used to refinance residential mortgages it evolved as a means to finance public sector loans and ship mortgages over time. (source: German Association of Pfandbrief Banks). The global covered bond market volume (covered bonds outstanding) amounted to EUR 2.1 trillion at year-end 2007.

Instead of individual banks placing large-volume issues, the Jumbo Pfandbrief allows an issuing syndicate with the goal of marketing Jumbo Pfandbrief issues and of subsequently ensuring market making. A Jumbo Pfandbrief must have a minimum issuance volume of EUR 1 billion. The average issue size of a Jumbo Pfandbrief is about EUR 1.5 billion. A minimum of five market makers is required. Jumbo Pfandbriefe must be listed on the German stock exchange.German Pfandbrief Association; Securitization of Derivatives and Alternative Asset Classes, by Jan Job de Vries Robb√©, Paul A. U.

Milo March A successful series of tightly plotted novels about a brandy-drinking, poetry-quoting New York insurance investigator named Milo March was published under the name M.E. Chaber from the mid-1950s to the early 1970s: Hangman‚Äôs Harvest (1952), No Grave for March (1953), As Old as Cain (1954), The Man Inside (1954; made into a 1958 film), The Splintered Man (1955), A Lonely Walk, based on the Wilma Montesi case (1956), The Gallows Garden (1958), A Hearse of Another Color (1958), So Dead the Rose (1959), Jade for a Lady (1962), Softly in the Night (1963), Six Who Ran (1964), Uneasy Lies the Dead (1964), Wanted: Dead Men (1965), The Day It Rained Diamonds (1966), A Man in the Middle (1967), Wild Midnight Falls (1968), The Flaming Man (1969), Green Grow the Graves (1970), The Bonded Dead (1971), and Born to Be Hanged (1973). In some of these plots, March is called to duty in the U.S. Army Reserve. Notable among these is The Splintered Man, in which he rescues the West German head of counterespionage police kidnapped by the East Germans (a character loosely based on Otto John), who are forcing him to take LSD as a mind-control experiment. In 1967, also under the name M.E. Chaber, Crossen published The Acid Nightmare, a cautionary young adult novel about LSD. A final Milo March manuscript, set in Vietnam, was completed in 1975 but was unpublished during the author's lifetime owing to a difference of opinion with his publisher, Holt, Rinehart & Winston, who told him it was \\"too political and too controversial.\\" Paperback Library reissued 20 Milo March novels from 1970 to 1971 (Born to Be Hanged didn't make it into the series). The same series included four novels featuring insurance investigator Brian Brett: Abra-Cadaver, The Burned Man, Once Upon a Crime, and The Lonely Graves, all as by Christopher Monig. The final book in the series is The Tortured Path, written as by Kendell Foster Crossen, featuring Major Kim Locke of the CIA, on assignment in Communist China. Two other Kim Locke novels, in which Locke works with a military dog, were omitted from the Paperback Library series: The Big Dive and The Gentle Assassin, the latter as by Clay Richards. In 2020, Steeger Books/Altus Press started reprinting the whole Milo March series, and will be including the unpublished work and a collection of Milo March short stories.

It is from the town of Manacor and is within the Manacor municipality.  Geography  The village is located in a major tourist area between Costa de los Pinos and Cala Murada. Its small bay opens to the southeast and seems almost closed on the right, by a large rock called Es Morro de Sa Carabassa. At its end, a lighthouse built in 1851 rises. The slope called Punta d'Es Pelats partially closes the pier of Port de Manacor/Porto Cristo and a stretch of sea rises a quarter mile west juts and twists later, at a right angle, in north direction prolonging itself some three hundred meters more. This hardly navigable area constitutes the last primitive vestige of the port, which has been gradually blinded by the alluvial lands, now converted into fords and small orchards, at the end of the depression, which reaches about two kilometers, The height of the Caves of the Hams, was the pier during the Roman domination. By road is communicated from north to south by 4 routes: * Ma-4023 towards Son Servera (9 km). * Ma-4024 towards Son Carri√≥ (6 km). * Ma-4020 towards Manacor (12 km). * Ma-4014 towards Porto Colom (18 km). Tourism Porto Cristo remains a modern but unspoilt all year round location. Though in no way a primary tourist destination in Mallorca, Port de Manacor/Porto Cristo promotes itself as a quiet resort and tries to encourage foreign visitors. The main tourist attractions are two sets of caves, the larger Coves del Drach and the Coves dels Hams. Beach of Port de Manacor/Porto Cristo To improve the traffic flow in the main tourist season a by pass road around Porto Cristo has now been opened. This new road connects the PMV 4023 to the MA 4020 and MA 4014. The name Port de Manacor/Porto Cristo, meaning \\"The Port of Manacor/The Port of Christ\\" given to it back in 1260 AD at the time of the Christian invasion of Mallorca, A fishing boat was found washed up on the beach containing a crucifix. Legend has it that an ox was carrying an icon of God through the town, and the ox stopped and refused to walk anymore. Hence the people saw this as a sign and the name was derived from that belief it was a clear sign that Christ wanted to be here. What sets Port de Manacor/Porto Cristo apart from most of the other Mallorcan resorts is that its income is not solely dependent on tourism; Port de Manacor/Porto Cristo still maintains its functions as a Spanish fishing village. Its larger municipality, Manacor, is the centre of the pearl manufacturing industry on Mallorca. Coves del Drach Port de Manacor/Porto Cristo Harbour is a natural harbour which still shelters small fishing boats from storms. The addition in recent years of the new marina now provides moorings to high-end pleasure boats. The mix of the new and the old has been done tastefully, as Porto Cristo seeks to ensure it retains its heritage. Port de Manacor/Porto Cristo is a quiet town perfect for a stroll along the main front or a romantic meal overlooking the breathtaking ocean. Crime is rare in Port de Manacor/Porto Cristo and it has a very active police presence ensuring it retains its reputation as a safe place to visit on the island. Residents The professional tennis player, Rafael Nadal, has a family holiday home in Port de Manacor/Porto Cristo.

A universal Œ¥-functor is a Œ¥-functor satisfying a specific universal property related to extending morphisms beyond \\"degree 0\\". These notions were introduced by Alexander Grothendieck in his \\"Tohoku paper\\" to provide an appropriate setting for derived functors.Grothendieck 1957 In particular, derived functors are universal Œ¥-functors. The terms homological Œ¥-functor and cohomological Œ¥-functor are sometimes used to distinguish between the case where the morphisms \\"go down\\" (homological) and the case where they \\"go up\\" (cohomological). In particular, one of these modifiers is always implicit, although often left unstated. Definition Given two abelian categories A and B a covariant cohomological Œ¥-functor between A and B is a family {Tn} of covariant additive functors Tn : A ‚Üí B indexed by the non-negative integers, and for each short exact sequence :0\\\\rightarrow M^\\\\prime\\\\rightarrow M\\\\rightarrow M^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}\\\\rightarrow0 a family of morphisms :\\\\delta^n:T^n(M^{\\\\prime\\\\prime})\\\\rightarrow T^{n+1}(M^\\\\prime) indexed by the non-negative integers satisfying the following two properties: 1\\\\. For each short exact sequence as above, there is a long exact sequence :480px 2\\\\. For each morphism of short exact sequences :400px and for each non-negative n, the induced square :250px is commutative (the Œ¥n on the top is that corresponding to the short exact sequence of M's whereas the one on the bottom corresponds to the short exact sequence of N's). The second property expresses the functoriality of a Œ¥-functor. The modifier \\"cohomological\\" indicates that the Œ¥n raise the index on the T. A covariant homological Œ¥-functor between A and B is similarly defined (and generally uses subscripts), but with Œ¥n a morphism Tn(M ) ‚Üí Tn-1(M). The notions of contravariant cohomological Œ¥-functor between A and B and contravariant homological Œ¥-functor between A and B can also be defined by \\"reversing the arrows\\" accordingly. =Morphisms of Œ¥-functors= A morphism of Œ¥-functors is a family of natural transformations that, for each short exact sequence, commute with the morphisms Œ¥. For example, in the case of two covariant cohomological Œ¥-functors denoted S and T, a morphism from S to T is a family Fn : Sn ‚Üí Tn of natural transformations such that for every short exact sequence :0\\\\rightarrow M^\\\\prime\\\\rightarrow M\\\\rightarrow M^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}\\\\rightarrow0 the following diagram commutes: :720px =Universal Œ¥-functor= A universal Œ¥-functor is characterized by the (universal) property that giving a morphism from it to any other Œ¥-functor (between A and B) is equivalent to giving just F0. If S denotes a covariant cohomological Œ¥-functor between A and B, then S is universal if given any other (covariant cohomological) Œ¥-functor T (between A and B), and given any natural transformation :F_0:S^0\\\\rightarrow T^0 there is a unique sequence Fn indexed by the positive integers such that the family { Fn }n ‚â• 0 is a morphism of Œ¥-functors.

Mitsui Chemicals Agro Inc. is the main manufacturer of the chemical. It is also used as an ingredient in flea medication for cats and dogs. General uses Etofenprox is an insecticide which disturbs insect nervous systems following direct contact or ingestion, and which is active against a broad spectrum of pests. It is used in agriculture, horticulture, viticulture, forestry, animal health and public health against many insect pests, for instance Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, Thysanoptera, and Hymenoptera. In agriculture, etofenprox is used on a broad range of crops such as rice, fruits, vegetables, corn, soybeans, and tea. It is poorly absorbed by roots and little translocation occurs within plants. In the public health sector, etofenprox is used for vector control either by direct application in infested areas or indirectly by impregnating fabrics, such as mosquito nets. Etofenprox is used at low volumes to control adult mosquitoes, non-biting midges, and biting and non-biting flies. Etofenprox is used undiluted for ultra low volume aerosol applications or diluted with a diluent such as mineral oil for direct applications, for the control of pest species in or near residential, industrial, commercial, urban, recreational areas, woodlands, golf courses, and other areas where these pests are a problem. Hazards to humans and domestic animals Etofenprox is harmful if swallowed and causes moderate eye irritation. Contact with eyes, skin or clothing should be avoided. Repeated exposure to etofenprox can cause skin irritation. s are >2000 mg/kg (acute oral, rat), >2000 mg/kg (acute dermal, rat), and >5.88 mg/l (acute inhalation, rat).

Success in the 1500 metres event results in the game returning to Day 1 to repeat the events with more difficult qualification criteria. Depending on the computer, running is simulated by hitting two keys (representing the left and right leg) alternately and as quickly as possible or by moving the joystick from side to side as quickly as possible. The game rapidly gained a reputation among players as a \\"joystick killer\\" because of the constant vigorous waggling of the joystick required during many of the events.

It is a sea louse, a parasite living mostly on salmon, particularly on Pacific and Atlantic salmon and sea trout, but is also sometimes found on the three-spined stickleback. It feeds on the mucus, skin and blood of the fish.\\"Sea Lice.\\" Marine Institute. Marine Institute, n. d. Web. 10 Dec. 2013. <>. Once detached, they can be blown by wind across the surface of the sea, like plankton. When they encounter a suitable marine fish host, they adhere themselves to the skin, fins, or gills of the fish, and feed on the mucus or skin. Sea lice only affect fish and are not harmful to humans. Salmon lice are ectoparasites of salmon. In the 1980s, high levels of salmon lice were observed on pink salmon smolts. Salmon lice are found in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans; they infect pink salmon, Atlantic salmon, and chum salmon. Life cycle Some research has occurred on the problems caused by this species in aquaculture, but little is known about the salmon louse's life in nature. Salmon louse infections in fish farming facilities, though, can cause epizootics in wild fish. When aquaculturalists place their post smolts into sea water, they are commonly known to be ectoparasite free, and this can last for many months. L. salmonis has a direct lifecycle (i.e. a single host) with eight life stages with ecdysis in between. These planktonic nauplii cannot swim directionally against the water current, but drift passively, and have the ability to adjust their depth in the water column. They are almost translucent in colour and are about 0.5-0.6 mm long. At , the nauplius 1 stage lasts about 52 hours, and about 9 hours at . Nauplius 2 takes 170 hours and 36 hours at these temperatures, respectively. They are responsive to light and salinity. Low salinities appear to have a greater effect on the planktonic stages than on the parasitic stages. Newly hatched larvae do not survive below salinities of 15‚Ä∞ and poor development to the infective copepodid occurs between 20 and 25‚Ä∞. Nauplii and copepodids are positively phototactic and exhibit a daily vertical migration, rising during the day and sinking at night. The ability to find their hosts is not light dependent. They are responsive to low-frequency water accelerations, such as those produced by a swimming fish. Finding their migratory hosts in the vastness of the ocean is still a mystery for scientists to solve, but the species has managed to do this effectively for millennia. The third stage is the copepodid stage, in which the length is about 0.7 mm and could take 2 to 14 days depending on water temperature, and the salmon louse attaches itself to the fish. Stages four and five are the chalimus stages. The salmon louse becomes mobile and can move around the surface of fish and can also swim in the water column, and grows to a length of 5 mm for the males, 10 mm for the females. Duration times are roughly 10 days for copepodid, 10 days chalimus I, 15 for chalimus 2, 10 days for preadult 1 females, and 12 days for preadult 2 females at . Males develop faster, spending around 8 days as preadult 1 and 9 days as preadult 2 at . Chalimus stages measure in length from 1.1 mm at stage 1 to 2.3 mm at stage 2. Two preadult stages are followed by the fully mature adult phase. In the preadult stages, the genital complex is underdeveloped and the mean length is about 3.6 mm. Final moults to adult stages, both male and female, then take place. The female is larger than the male, with males measuring 5‚Äì6 mm and females 8‚Äì18 mm. Female adults can produce 10-11 pairs of egg strings over their lifecycle. Mean egg numbers per string (fecundity) have been recorded as 152 (+16) with a range from 123 to 183 at . The development to sexual maturity following attachment to the host fish depends on water temperature and the generation time, from egg to mature adult, and ranges from 32 days at to 106 days at . Egg strings tend to be longer with higher fecundity at lower temperatures, but factors affecting egg production are poorly understood. The sea louse generation time is around 8‚Äì9 weeks at , 6 weeks at , and 4 weeks at . The lifespan of the adult under natural conditions has not been determined, but under laboratory conditions, females have lived for up to 210 days. Description The thorax is broad and shield shaped. The abdomen is narrower, and in the females, filled with eggs. The females also have two long egg strings attached to the abdomen. The salmon louse uses its feet to move around on the host or to swim from one host to another. Effects on salmon farms This parasite is one of the major threats to salmon farmers. Salmon are stocked usually for a 14 - 18-month cycle.\\"Sea Lice.\\" Farmed and Dangerous. N.p., n. d. Web. 10 Dec. 2013. . Salmon farms are an unusual, but ideal environment for the sea lice to breed. The infestations of sea lice in salmon farms increases the number of lice in the rest of the surrounding water dramatically if the eggs from the gravid louse are allowed to disperse. Sea lice can also affect juvenile salmon while salmon from the rivers migrating to the ocean if on the way they pass by fish farms, the early stage and mature stages of sea lice may attaches onto them as well. The Salmon louse currently infests nearly half of Scotland's salmon farms. In 2016 Guardian news stated that the lice killed thousands of tonnes of farmed fish, caused skin lesions and secondary infections in millions more, and cost the Scottish salmon industry around ¬£300m in control efforts. Disease In small numbers, salmon lice cause little damage to a fish although if populations increase on a fish, this can lead to death. The parasites can cause physical damage to the fish's fins, skin erosion, constant bleeding, and open wounds creating pathways for other pathogens. The sea lice may also act as a vector for diseases between wild and farmed salmon. These copepod vectors have caused infectious salmon anemia (ISA) along the Atlantic coast.APHIS Veterinary Services, Infectious Salmon Anemia Tech Note. 2002, US Department of Agriculture. An outbreak of ISA occurred in Chile during 2007 where it spread quickly from one farm to another, destroying the salmon farms. Salmon lice infection in pink salmon weakens ionic homeostasis in pink salmon smolts. Homeostasis is needed for the internal regulation of body temperature and pH levels; the process allows fish to travel from fresh water to sea water. Disruption of ionic homeostasis in pre-mature smolt stages can result in reductions in growth rate, limit swimming capabilities, and even death. Disturbances in hydro mineral balance can result in negative consequences at the cellular, tissue, and organism levels. High levels of salmon lice infections result in a weaker ion regulation system.Brauner, C. J., Sackville, M., Gallagher, Z., Tang, S., Nendick, L., & Farrell, A. P. (2012). Physiological consequences of the salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) on juvenile pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha): implications for wild salmon ecology and management, and for salmon aquaculture.Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,367(1596), 1770-1779. The ability to activate an inflammatory response is a way to combat salmon lice infection. The intensity of inflammatory response controls how fast the parasites are rejected from the body. Intensity is determined by recognition of and regulation by salmon lice secretory/excretory products (SEP), which include proteases and prostaglandin E2. The marine parasite secretes SEP into the damaged skin of the salmon which inhibits proteolytic activity. Proteolytic activity increases the amount of host peptides and amino acids that can be used as a source of nutrition and lowers the intensity of inflammatory responses.Jones, S., & Johnson, S. (2015). Biology of sea lice, Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus spp., in western and eastern Canada.

Scientific career In 1949 prime minister David Ben-Gurion sent a letter to England to offer Tabor a job on the 'physics and engineering desk' of the Research Council of Israel, which he accepted. His first task was to create the National Physical Laboratory of Israel, which had been Tabor's idea as he felt it was essential the new country have the equivalent of the National Physical Laboratory in Britain to create standards amongst the different measurements in use in the country, primarily British, Ottoman and metric. Once the laboratory was established, he focused on solar energy for research and development. He was instrumental in developing the solar water heater that 95 percent of Israeli households have. In 1992 he was awarded an honorary degree from the Weizmann Institute of Science.Honorary degrees of the Weizmann. These simple water heaters operated without pumps, whereby cold water was heated in the panel, which acted as a thermosiphon. This unit in turn became the standard for solar water heating worldwide, and helped popularize the commercialization of solar thermal technology in the United States in the 1970s, where Tabor lectured and acted as a consultant to solar start-up companies such as Northrup, Inc. which subsequently merged into ARCO Solar, which became BP Solar. Tabor experimented with various coatings to optimize the absorptivity of solar energy, with minimizing the re-radiation, or emissivity of the heat absorbed. This led to his development of a \\"black chrome\\" surface for the copper water-bearing plate. Tabor worked with the Standards Institute of Israel, to establish testing procedures and an official performance certificates so that a solar collector could not be bought without SII certification.

The North American fur trade was an industry and activity related to the acquisition, trade, exchange, and sale of animal furs in North America. Aboriginal peoples in Canada and Native Americans in the United States of various regions traded among themselves in the pre‚ÄìColumbian Era. Europeans participated in the trade from the time of their arrival in the New World, extending the trade's reach to Europe. The French started trading in the 16th century, the English established trading posts on Hudson Bay in present-day Canada during the 17th century, while the Dutch had trade by the same time in New Netherland. North American fur trade was at its peak of economic importance in the 19th century, and involved the development of elaborate trade networks. The fur trade became one of the main economic ventures in North America attracting competition among the French, British, Dutch, Spanish, and Russians. Indeed, in the early history of the United States, capitalizing on this trade, and removing the British stranglehold over it, was seen as a major economic objective. Many Native American societies across the continent came to depend on the fur trade as their primary source of income. By the mid-1800s changing fashions in Europe brought about a collapse in fur prices. The American Fur Company and some other companies failed. Many Native communities were plunged into long- term poverty and consequently lost much of the political influence they once had. Origins French explorer Jacques Cartier in his three voyages into the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the 1530s and 1540s conducted some of the earliest fur trading between European and First Nations peoples associated with sixteenth century and later explorations in North America. Cartier attempted limited fur trading with the First Nations in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and along the St. Lawrence River. He concentrated on trading for furs used as trimming and adornment. He overlooked the fur that would become the driving force of the fur trade in the north, the beaver pelt, which would become fashionable in Europe. Fur cleaning tools The earliest European trading for beaver pelts dated to the growing cod fishing industry that spread to the Grand Banks of the North Atlantic in the 16th century. The new preservation technique of drying fish allowed the mainly Basque fishermen to fish near the Newfoundland coast and transport fish back to Europe for sale. The fisherman sought suitable harbors with ample lumber to dry large quantities of cod. This generated their earliest contact with local Aboriginal peoples, with whom the fisherman began simple trading. The fishermen traded metal items for beaver robes made of sewn-together, native-tanned, beaver pelts. They used the robes to keep warm on the long, cold return voyages across the Atlantic. These castor gras in French became prized by European hat makers in the second half of the 16th century, as they converted the pelts to fur felt. The discovery of the superior felting qualities of beaver fur, along with the rapidly increasing popularity of beaver felt hats in fashion, transformed the incidental trading of fishermen in the sixteenth century into a growing trade in the French and later English territories in the next century. New France in the 17th century Map of New France (Champlain, 1612) The transition from a seasonal coastal trade into a permanent interior fur trade was formally marked with the foundation of Quebec on the St. Lawrence River in 1608 by Samuel de Champlain. This settlement marked the beginning of the westward movement of French traders from the first permanent settlement of Tadoussac at the mouth of the Saguenay River on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, up the St. Lawrence River and into the pays d'en haut (or \\"upper country\\") around the Great Lakes. What followed in the first half of the 17th century were strategic moves by both the French and the indigenous groups to further their own economic and geopolitical ambitions. Samuel de Champlain led the expansion while centralizing the French efforts. As native peoples had the primary role of suppliers in the fur trade, Champlain quickly created alliances with the Algonquin, Montagnais (who were located in the territory around Tadoussac), and most importantly, the Huron to the west. The latter, an Iroquoian-speaking people, served as middlemen between the French on the St. Lawrence and nations in the pays d'en haut. Champlain supported the northern groups in their preexisting military struggle with the Iroquois Confederacy to the south. He secured the Ottawa River route to Georgian Bay, greatly expanding the trade. Champlain also sent young French men to live and work among the natives, most notably √âtienne Br√ªl√©, to learn the land, language, and customs, as well as to promote trade. Champlain reformed the business of the trade, creating the first informal trust in 1613 in response to increasing losses due to competition. The trust was later formalized with a royal charter, leading to a series of trade monopolies during the term of New France. The most notable monopoly was the Company of One Hundred Associates, with occasional concessions, such as to habitants in the 1640s and 1650s, permitting them limited trading. While the monopolies dominated the trade, their charters also required payment of annual returns to the national government, military expenditures, and expectations that they would encourage settlement for the sparsely populated New France. The vast wealth in the fur trade created enforcement problems for the monopoly. Unlicensed independent traders, known as coureurs des bois (or \\"runners of the woods\\"), began to do business in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Over time, many M√©tis were drawn to the independent trade; they were the descendants of French trappers and native women. The increasing use of currency, as well as the importance of personal contacts and experience in the fur trade, gave an edge to independent traders over the more bureaucratic monopolies. The newly established English colonies to the south quickly joined the lucrative trade, raiding the St. Lawrence River valley and capturing and controlling Quebec from 1629 to 1632. While bringing wealth to a few select French traders and the French regime, the fur trade also brought profound changes to the indigenous groups living along the St. Lawrence. European wares, such as iron axe heads, brass kettles, cloth, and firearms were bought with beaver pelts and other furs. The widespread practice of trading furs for rum and whiskey led to problems associated with inebriation and alcohol abuse. The subsequent destruction of beaver populations along the St. Lawrence heightened the fierce competition between the Iroquois and Huron for access to the rich fur-bearing lands of the Canadian Shield. The competition for hunting is believed to have contributed to the earlier destruction of the St. Lawrence Iroquoians in the valley by 1600, likely by the Iroquois Mohawk tribe, who were located closest to them, were more powerful than the Huron, and had the most to gain by controlling this part of the valley. Iroquois access to firearms through Dutch and later English traders along the Hudson River increased the casualties in the warfare. This greater bloodshed, previously unseen in Iroquoian warfare, increased the practice of \\"Mourning Wars\\". The Iroquois raided neighboring groups to take captives, who were ritually adopted to replace the dead Iroquois; thus a cycle of violence and warfare escalated. More significantly, new infectious diseases brought by the French decimated native groups and broke up their communities. Combined with warfare, disease led to the near destruction of the Huron by 1650. Anglo-French competition Map of French and British North American possessions in the early 18th century. Note French expansion into Lake Winnipeg and British control of Hudson Bay, both prime fur-producing areas. During the 1640s and 1650s, the Beaver Wars initiated by the Iroquois (also known as the Haudenosaunee) forced a massive demographic shift as their western neighbors fled the violence. They sought refuge west and north of Lake Michigan. The Five Nations of the Iroquois, who had a predatory attitude towards their neighbors even at the best of times, constantly raiding neighboring peoples in \\"mourning wars\\" in search of captives who would become Iroquois, were determined to be the only middlemen between the Europeans and the other Indians who lived in the West, and quite consciously set about eliminating any rivals as such as the Wendat (Huron). By the 1620s, the Iroquois had become dependent upon iron implements, which they obtained by trading fur with the Dutch at Fort Nassau (modern Albany, New York). Between 1624‚Äì1628, the Iroquois drove out their neighbors, the Mahican, to allow themselves to be the one people in the Hudson river valley able to trade with the Dutch. By 1640, the Five Nations had exhausted the supply of beavers in Kanienkeh (\\"the land of the flint\\"-the Iroquois name for their homeland in what is now upstate New York), and moreover Kanienkeh lacked the beavers with the thick pelts that the Europeans favored and would pay the best price for, which were to be found further north in what is now northern Canada. The Five Nations launched the \\"Beaver Wars\\" to take control of the fur trade by allowing themselves to be only middlemen who would deal with the Europeans. The Wendat homeland, Wendake, lies in what is now southern Ontario being bordered on three sides by Lake Ontario, Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay, and it was through Wendake that the Ojibwe and Cree who lived further north traded with the French. In 1649, the Iroquois made a series of raids into Wendake that were intended to destroy the Wendat as a people with thousands of Wendat taken to be adopted by Iroquois families with the rest being killed. The war against the Wendat was at least just as much a \\"mourning war\\" as a \\"beaver war\\" as the Iroquois obsessively raided Wendake for ten years after their great raids of 1649 to take single Wendat back to Kanienkeh, even though they did not possess much in the way of beaver pelts. The Iroquois's population had been devastated by losses due to European diseases like smallpox which they had no immunity to, and it is notable that when the Iroquois finally made peace with the French in 1667, one of the terms was the French had to hand over all of the Wendat who had fled to New France to them. The Iroquois had already clashed with the French in 1609, 1610 and 1615, but the \\"beaver wars\\" caused a lengthy struggle with the French who had no intention of allowing the Five Nations to set themselves up as the only middlemen in the fur trade. The French did not fare well at first, with the Iroquois inflicting more casualties then they suffered, French settlements frequently cut off, canoes bringing fur to Montreal intercepted and sometimes the Iroquois blockaded the St. Lawrence. New France was a proprietary colony run by the Compagnie des Cent-Associ√©s who went bankrupt in 1663 because of the Iroquois attacks which made the fur trade unprofitable for the French. After the Compagnie des Cent-Associ√©s went bankrupt, New France was taken over by the French Crown. King Louis XIV wanted his new Crown colony to turn a profit and dispatched the Carignan-Sali√®res Regiment to defend it. In 1666, the Carignan-Sali√®res Regiment made a devastating raid upon Kanienkeh, which led the Five Nations to sue for peace in 1667. The era from roughly 1660 through 1763 saw a fierce rivalry grow between France and Great Britain as each European power struggled to expand their fur-trading territories. The two imperial powers and their native allies competed in conflicts that culminated in the French and Indian War, a part of the Seven Years' War in Europe. The 1659‚Äì1660 voyage of French traders Pierre-Esprit Radisson and M√©dard Chouart des Groseilliers into the country north and west of Lake Superior symbolically opened this new era of expansion. Their trading voyage proved extremely lucrative in furs. More importantly, they learned of a frozen sea to the north that provided easy access to the fur-bearing interior. Upon their return, French officials confiscated the furs of these unlicensed coureurs des bois. Radisson and Groseilliers went to Boston and then to London to secure funding and two ships to explore the Hudson Bay. Their success led to England's chartering of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1670, a major player in the fur trade for the next two centuries. French exploration and expansion westward continued with men such as La Salle and Marquette exploring and claiming the Great Lakes as well as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. To bolster these territorial claims, the French constructed a series of small fortifications, beginning with Fort Frontenac on Lake Ontario in 1673. Together with the construction of Le Griffon in 1679, the first full-sized sailing ship on the Great Lakes, the forts opened the upper Great Lakes to French navigation. More native groups learned about European wares and became trading middlemen, most notably the Ottawa. The competitive impact of the new English Hudson's Bay Company trade was felt as early as 1671, with diminished returns for the French and the role of the native middlemen. This new competition directly stimulated French expansion into the North West to win back native customers. What followed was a continual expansion north and west of Lake Superior. The French used diplomatic negotiations with natives to win back trade and an aggressive military policy to temporarily eliminate the Hudson's Bay Company competition. At the same time, the English presence in New England grew stronger, while the French were occupied with trying to combat the coureurs de bois and allied Indians from smuggling furs to the English for often higher prices and higher quality goods than they could offer. In 1675, the Iroquois made peace with the Machian while finally defeating the Susquenhannock. In the late 1670s and early 1680s, the Five Nations started to raid what is now the Midwest, battling the Miami and the Illinois while alternatively fighting against and attempting to make an alliance with the Ottawa. One Onondaga chief, Otreouti, whom the French called La Grande Gueule (\\"the big mouth\\"), announced in a speech in 1684 that the wars against the Illinois and Miami were justified because \\"They came to hunt beavers on our lands ...\\". Initially, the French took an ambivalent attitude towards the Iroquois push west. On one hand, having the Five Nations at war with other nations prevented those nations from trading with the English at Albany while on the other hand, the French did not want the Iroquois to become the only middlemen in the fur trade. But as the Iroquois continued to win against the other nations, prevented French and Algonquin fur traders from entering the Mississippi river valley, and the Ottawa showed signs of finally making an alliance with the Five Nations, in 1684 the French declared war on the Iroquois. Otreouti in an appeal for help correctly noted: \\"The French will have all the beavers and are angry with us for bringing you any\\". Starting in 1684, the French repeatedly raided Kanienkeh, burning crops and villages as Louis gave orders to \\"humble\\" the Five Nations once and for all, and to teach them to respect the \\"grandeur\\" of France. The repeated French raids took their toll with the Mohawk who could field about 300 warriors in the 1670s to able to field only 170 warriors in the summer of 1691. The Iroquois struck back by making raids into New France with the most successful being a raid on Lachine in 1689 that killed 24 Frenchmen while taking 80 captives, but the superior resources of the French state proceeded to grind them down until they finally made peace in 1701. The settlement of native refugees from the Iroquois Wars in the western and northern Great Lakes combined with the decline of the Ottawa middlemen to create vast new markets for French traders. Resurgent Iroquoian warfare in the 1680s also stimulated the fur trade as native French allies bought weapons. The new more distant markets and fierce English competition stifled direct trade from the North West with Montreal. The old system of native middlemen and coureurs de bois traveling to trade fairs in Montreal or illegally to English markets was replaced by an increasingly complex and labor-intensive trade network. Licensed voyageurs, allied with Montreal merchants, used water routes to reach the far-flung corners of the North West with canoe loads of trade goods. These risky ventures required large initial investments and had a very slow return. The first revenues from fur sales in Europe did not arrive until four or more years after the initial investment. These economic factors concentrated the fur trade in the hands of a few large Montreal merchants who had available capital. This trend expanded in the eighteenth century, and reached its zenith with the great fur-trading companies of the nineteenth century. Indigenous Peoples' response to French‚ÄìEnglish competition The effect on beaver stocks of competition between the English and the French was disastrous. The status of beavers changed dramatically as it went from being a source of food and clothing for Indigenous Peoples to a vital good for exchange with the Europeans. The French were constantly in search of cheaper fur and trying to cut off Indigenous middleman which led them to explore the interior all the way to Lake Winnipeg and the Central Plains. While some historians dispute the claims that the competition was predominantly responsible for over-exploitation of stocks, others have used empirical analysis to emphasize the changing economic incentives for Indigenous hunters and role of the Europeans in the matter. Innis holds that the population of beavers decreased dramatically even before the rivalry in the 1700s and stocks in far-flung western areas were increasingly being tapped before there was any serious competition between the English and the French. There is widespread agreement on the matter in ethnohistory literature that Indigenous hunters depleted the resource. Calvin Martin holds that there was a breakdown of the relationship between man and animal among some Indigenous actors who hunted to feed global fur markets with little consideration or understanding of the possibility of extinction. The English and French had very different trading hierarchical structures. The Hudson's Bay Company had a technical monopoly of the beaver trade within the drainage basin of Hudson Bay while the Compagnie d'Occident was given a monopoly of the beaver trade farther south. The English organized their trade on strictly hierarchical lines while the French used licenses to lease the use of their posts. This meant that the French incentivized the extension of trade, and French traders did indeed infiltrate much of the Great Lakes region. The French established posts on Lake Winnipeg, Lac des Praires and Lake Nipigon which represented a serious threat to flow of furs to the York Factory. The increasing penetration near English ports now meant that the Aboriginals had more than one place to sell their goods. As competition increased between the English and French in the 1700s, the fur was still predominantly caught by Aboriginal tribes which acted as the middleman. The response to increased competition led to a severe over-harvesting of beavers. Data from three of the trading posts of the Hudson's Bay Company show this trend. The simulation of beaver populations around trading posts are done by taking into account the beaver returns from each trading post, biological evidence on beaver population dynamics and contemporary estimates of beaver densities. While the view that increased competition between the English and the French led to over-exploitation of beaver stocks by the Aboriginals does not receive uncritical support, most believe that Aboriginals were the primary actors in depleting animal stocks. There is a lack of critical discussion on other factors such as beaver population dynamics, the number of animals harvested, nature of property rights, prices, role of the English and the French in the matter. The primary effect of increased French competition was that the English raised the prices they paid to the Aboriginals to harvest fur. The result of this was greater incentive for Aboriginals to increase harvests. Increased price will lead to a gap between demand and supply and to a higher equilibrium in terms of supply. Data from the trading posts show that the supply of beavers from the Aboriginals was price-elastic and therefore traders responded with increased harvests as prices rose. The harvests were further increased due to the fact that no tribe had an absolute monopoly near any trade and most of them were competing against each other to derive the maximum benefit from the presence of the English and the French. Additionally, the problem of the commons is also glaringly visible in this matter. Open access to resources leads to no incentive to conserve stocks, and actors which try to conserve lose out compared to the others when it comes to maximizing economic output. Therefore, there appeared to be a lack of concern by tribes of the First Nations about the sustainability of the fur trade. The problem of over-exploitation is not helped by the fact that the efforts by the French to remove the middlemen such as the Huron who increasingly resented their influence meant that stocks were put under more pressure. All these factors contributed to an unsustainable trade pattern in furs which depleted beaver stocks very fast. An empirical study done by Ann M. Carlos and Frank D. Lewis shows that apart from the settling to a lower level of stable population, further declines were caused by over-harvesting in two of the three English trading posts (Albany and York). The data from the third trading post are also very interesting in that the post did not come under French pressure and was therefore shielded from the kind of over-exploitation of stocks which resulted at the other trading posts. At Fort Churchill, the stocks of beaver adjusted to the maximum sustained yield level. The data from Churchill further reinforce the case of over-exploitation of stocks caused by the French-English competition. Building relationshipsMarriage as a trading strategy= It was a common practice on the part of the Indian women to offer marriage and sometimes just sex in exchange for fur traders not trading with their rivals. Radisson described visiting one Ojibwe village in the spring of 1660 where during the welcoming ceremony: \\"The women throw themselves backwards on the ground, thinking to give us tokens of friendship and wellcome [welcome]\\". Radisson was initially confused by this gesture, but as the women started to engage in more overtly sexual behavior, he realized what was being offered. Radisson was informed by the village elders that he could have sex with any unmarried women in the village provided that he did not trade with the Dakota (aka Sioux), who were the enemies of the Ojibwe at the time. Likewise, the fur trader Alexander Henry in visiting an Ojibwe village in what is now Manitoba in 1775 described the \\"facility with which the women abandoned themselves to my \\"Canadiens\\" to such an extent that he believed it would cause violence as the Ojibwe men would become jealous, causing him to order his party to leave at once, though it is likely that the women were in fact acting with the approval of their menfolk. Henry claimed that he had left at once out of the fear of violence from jealous Ojibwe men, but it seemed more likely that he was afraid that his French-Canadian voyageurs might enjoy themselves too much with the Ojibwe women at this one village and would not want to travel further west. American historian Bruce White described the way in which the Ojibwe and the other Indian peoples sought to \\"use sexual relations as a means of establishing long-term relationships between themselves and people from another society was a rational strategy, one that has been described in many parts of the world\\". One fur trader who married an Ojibwe woman himself described how the Ojibwe would initially shun a fur trader until they could give gauge his honesty and provided he proved himself an honest man, \\"the chiefs would take together their marriageable girls to his trading house and he was given the choice of the lot\\". If the fur trader married, the Ojibwe would trade with him as he became part of the community and if he refused to marry, then the Ojibwe would not trade with him as Ojibwe only traded with a man who \\"took one of their women for his wife\\". Virtually all Indian communities encouraged fur traders to take an Indian wife in order to build a long-term relationship that would ensure the continual supply of European goods to their communities and discourage fur traders from dealing with other Indian tribes. The fur trade did not involve barter in the way that most people presuppose, but were a credit/debit relationship when a fur trader would arrive in a community in the summer or fall, hand out various goods to the Indians who would pay him back in the spring with the furs from the animals they had killed over the winter; in the interim, there much further exchanges, which often involved both Indian men and women. =Indigenous women as traders= Indian men were the trappers who killed the animals for their furs, but normally it was the women who were in charge of the furs that their menfolk had collected, making women into important players in the fur trade. Indian women normally harvested the rice and made the maple sugar that were such important parts of the traders' diets, for which they were usually paid with alcohol. Henry mentioned how at one Ojibwe village, the men only wanted alcohol in exchange for furs while the women demanded a wide variety of European goods in exchange for rice. Manufacturing canoes was work done by both Indian men and women, and accounts of fur traders often mentioned bartering goods with women in exchange for canoes. One French-Canadian voyageur named Michel Curot listed in his journal how in the course of one expedition, he traded goods for furs with Ojibwe men 19 times, with Ojibwe women 22 times, and another 23 times in which he did not list the gender of the people he was trading with. As women held a very low status in French- Canada (Quebec did not grant women the right to vote until 1940), White argued it is likely that the majority of the anonymous Indians that Curot traded with were women whose names were not considered important enough to write down. =Spiritual roles of women= For the Indians, dreams were viewed as messages from the world of the spirits, which was seen as a vastly more powerful and important world than the one inhabited by them. Gender roles were not fixed in Indian communities, and it was possible for a woman who had dreams of herself performing a masculine role being able to persuade her community on the basis of her dreams to be allowed to take part in work that was normally performed by men, since this was evidently what the spirits wanted. Ojibwe women in their teenage years embarked upon \\"vision quests\\" to find out what fate the spirits wanted for them. The Indians who lived around the Great Lakes believed that when a girl started to menstruate (regarded as giving women a special spiritual power) that whatever her dreams she might have were messages from the spirits, and many fur traders mentioned how women who were regarded as being especially favored with their dream-messages from the world of the spirits played important roles as decision-makers within their communities. Netnokwa, a charismatic Ojibwe matron living in the Red River region whose dreams were considered to be especially powerful messages from the spirits, traded directly with fur traders. John Tanner, her adopted son, noted she received \\"ten gallons of spirits\\" for free every year from the fur traders as it considered to be wise to stay in her good graces and whenever she visited Fort Mackinac \\"she was saluted by a gun from the fort\\". As menstrual blood was seen as sign of women's spiritual power, it was understood that men must never touch it. When Ojibwe girls entered puberty, they embarked upon fasting and ceremonies that marked the beginning of their \\"vision quests\\" to establish a relationship with the spirits with their dreams being seen as messages from the spirit world. Sometimes, Ojibwe girls would consume hallucinogenic mushrooms during their ceremonies to receive further messages from the world of the spirits. Having established a relationship with a particular spirit at puberty, women would go on further vision quests throughout their lives with more ceremonies and dreams to continue the relationship. =Marriage to cement alliances= Fur traders found that marrying the daughters of chiefs would ensure the co-operation of an entire community. Marriage alliances were also made between Indian tribes. In September 1679, the French diplomat and soldier Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut, called a peace conference at Fond du Lac (modern Duluth, Minnesota) of all the \\"nations of the north\\" which was attended by Ojibwe, Dakota, and Assiniboine leaders, where it was agreed that the daughters and sons of the various chiefs would marry each other to promote peace and ensure the flow of French goods into the region. The French fur trader Claude-Charles Le Roy wrote that the Dakota had decided to make peace with their traditional enemies, the Ojibwe, in order to obtain French goods that the Ojibwe were blocking them from receiving. Le Roy wrote the Dakota \\"could obtain French merchandise only through the agency of the Sauteurs [Ojibwe]\\" so they made \\"a treaty of peace by which they were mutually bound to give their daughters in marriage on both sides\\". Indian marriages usually involved a simple ceremony involving the exchange of valuable gifts from the parents of the bride and groom, and unlike European marriages, could be dissolved at any time by one partner choosing to walk out. The Indians were organized into kinship and clan networks, and marrying a woman from one of these kinship networks would make a fur trader into a member of these networks, thereby ensuring that Indians belonging to whatever clan the trader had married into were more likely to deal only with him. Furthermore, the fur traders discovered that the Indians were more likely to share food, especially during the hard months of winter, to those fur traders who were regarded as part of their communities. One fur trader who married an 18-year old Ojibwe girl described in his diary his \\"secret satisfaction at being compelled to marry for my safety\\". The converse of such marriages was that a fur trader was expected to favor whatever clan/kinship network that he had married into with European goods, and a fur trader who did not would ruin his reputation. For the Ojibwe, like the other Indians, saw all life in this world being based upon reciprocal relationships, with Ojibwe women leaving behind \\"gifts\\" of tobacco when harvesting plants to thank nature for providing the plants while when a bear was killed, a ceremony was held to thank the bear for \\"giving\\" up its life to them. =Ojibwe=Cultural beliefs The Ojibwe believed if the plants and animals were not thanked for \\"giving\\" themselves to them, then the plants and animals would be less \\"giving\\" the next year, and the same principle applied to their relations with other peoples such as the fur traders. The Ojibwe, like other First Nations, always believed that animals willingly allowed themselves to be killed, and that if a hunter failed to give thanks to the animal world, then the animals would be less \\"giving\\" the next time around. As the fur traders were predominately male and heterosexual while there were few white women beyond the frontier, the Indians were well aware of the sexual attraction felt by the fur traders towards their women, who were seen as having a special power over white men. From the Ojibwe viewpoint, if one of their women gave herself to a fur trader, it created the reciprocal obligation for the fur trader to give back. Fur-trading companies encouraged their employees to take Indian wives, not only to built long-term relationships that were good for business, but also because an employee with a wife would have to buy more supplies from his employer, with the money for the purchases usually subtracted from his wages. White decried the tendency of many historians to see these women as simply \\"passive\\" objects that were bartered for by fur traders and Indian tribal elders, writing that these women had to \\"exert influence and be active communicators of information\\" to be effective as the wife of a fur trader, and that many of the women who married fur traders \\"embraced\\" these marriages to achieve \\"useful purposes for themselves and for the communities that they lived in\\". Ojibwe women married to European traders One study of the Ojibwe women who married French fur traders maintained that the majority of the brides were \\"exceptional\\" women with \\"unusual ambitions, influenced by dreams and visions‚Äîlike the women who become hunters, traders, healers and warriors in Ruth Landes's account of Ojibwe women\\". Out of these relationships emerged the M√©tis people whose culture was a fusion of French and Indian elements. In 1793 Oshahgushkodanaqua, an Ojibwe woman from the far western end of Lake Superior, married John Johnston, a British fur trader based in Sault Ste. Marie working for the North West Company. Later in her old age, she gave an account to British writer Anna Brownell Jameson of how she came to be married. According to Jameson's 1838 book Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada, Oshahgushkodanaqua told her when she was 13, she embarked on her \\"vision quest\\" to find her guardian spirit by fasting alone in a lodge painted black on a high hill. During Oshahgushkodanaqua's \\"vision quest\\": About five years later, Oshahgushkodanaqua first met Johnston, who asked to marry her, but was refused permission by her father who did not think he wanted a long-term relationship. When Johnston returned the next year and again asked to marry Oshahgushkodanaqua, her father granted permission, but she herself declined, saying she disliked the implications of being married until death, but ultimately married under strong pressure from her father. Oshahgushkodanaqua came to embrace her marriage when she decided that Johnston was the white stranger she saw in her dreams during her vision quest. The couple stayed married for 36 years with the marriage ending with Johnston's death, and Oshahgushkodanaqua played an important role in her husband's business career. Jameson also noted Oshahgushkodanaqua was considered to be a strong woman among the Ojibwe, writing \\"in her youth she hunted and was accounted the surest eye and fleetest foot among the women of her tribe\\". Effects of fur trade on Indigenous PeopleOjibwe= White argued that the traditional \\"imperial adventure\\" historiography where the fur trade was the work of a few courageous white men who ventured into the wildness was flawed as it ignored the contributions of the Indians. The American anthropologist Ruth Landes in her 1937 book Ojibwe Women described Ojibwe society in the 1930s as based on \\"male supremacy\\", and she assumed this was how Ojibwe society had always been, a conclusion that has been widely followed. Landes did note that the women she interviewed told her stories about Ojibwe women who in centuries past inspired by their dream visions had played prominent roles as warriors, hunters, healers, traders and leaders. In 1978, the American anthropologist Eleanor Leacock who writing from a Marxist perspective in her article \\"Women's Status In Egalitarian Society\\" challenged Landes by arguing that Ojibwe society had in fact been egalitarian, but the fur trade had changed the dynamics of Ojibwe society from a simple barter economy to one where men could become powerful by having access to European goods, and this had led to the marginalization of Ojibwe women. More recently, the American anthropologist Carol Devens in her 1992 book Countering Colonization: Native American Women and the Great Lakes Missions 1630‚Äì1900 followed Leacock by arguing that exposure to the patriarchal values of ancien regime France together with the ability to collect \\"surplus goods\\" made possible by the fur trade had turned the egalitarian Ojibwe society into unequal society where women did not count for much. White wrote that an examination of the contemporary sources would suggest the fur trade had in fact empowered and strengthened the role of Ojibwe women who played a very important role in the fur trade, and it was the decline of the fur trade which had led to the decline of status of Ojibwe women. =Sub-arctic: reduced status of women= By contrast, the fur trade seems to have weakened the status of Indian women in the Canadian sub-arctic in what is now the North West Territories, the Yukon, and the northern parts of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. The harsh terrain imposed a nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyle on the people living there as to stay in one place for long would quickly exhaust the food supply. The Indians living in the sub- arctic had only small dogs incapable of carrying heavy loads with one fur trader in 1867 calling Gwich'in dogs \\"miserable creatures no smaller than foxes\\" while another noted \\"dogs were scare and burdens were supported by people's backs\\". The absence of navigable rivers made riparian transport impossible, so everything had to be carried on the backs of the women. There was a belief among the Northern Athabaskan peoples that weapons could be only handled by men, and that for a weapon to be used by a woman would cause it to lose its effectiveness; as relations between the various bands were hostile, during travel, men were always armed while the women carried all of the baggage. All of the Indian men living in the sub-arctic had an acute horror of menstrual blood, seen as an unclean substance that no men could ever touch, and as a symbol of a threatening femininity. The American anthropologist Richard J. Perry suggested that under the impact of the fur trade that certain misogynistic tendencies that were already long established among the Northern Athabaskan peoples became significantly worse. Owing to the harsh terrain of the subarctic and the limited food supplies, the First Nations peoples living there had long practiced infanticide to limit their band sizes, as a large population would starve. One fur trader in the 19th century noted that within the Gwich'in, newly born girls were far more likely to be victims of infanticide than boys, owing to the low status of women, adding that female infanticide was practiced to such an extent there was a shortage of women in their society. =Chipewyan: drastic changes= The Chipewyan began trading fur in exchange for metal tools and instruments with the Hudson's Bay Company in 1717, which caused a drastic change in their lifestyle, going from a people engage in daily subsidence activities to a people engaging in far-reaching trade as the Chipewyan become the middlemen between the Hudson's Bay Company and the other Indians living further inland. The Chipewyan guarded their right to trade with the Hudson's Bay Company with considerable jealousy and prevented peoples living further inland like the T≈Çƒ±Ã®ch«´ and Yellowknives from crossing their territory to trade directly with the Hudson's Bay Company for the entire 18th century. For the Chipewyan, who were still living in the Stone Age, metal implements were greatly valued as it took hours to heat up a stone pot, but only minutes to heat up a metal pot, while an animal could be skinned far more efficiently and quickly with a metal knife than with a stone knife. For many Chipewyan bands, involvement with the fur trade eroded their self- sufficiency as they killed animals for the fur trade, not food, which forced them into dependency on other bands for food, thus leading to a cycle where many Chipewyan bands came to depend trading furs for European goods, which were traded for food, and which caused them to make very long trips across the subarctic to Hudson's Bay and back. To make these trips, the Chipewyan traveled though barren terrain that was so devoid of life that starvation was a real threat, during which the women had to carry all of the supplies. Samuel Hearne of the Hudson's Bay Company who was sent inland in 1768 to establish contact with the \\"Far Indians\\" as the company called them, wrote about the Chipewyan: Hearne's chief guide Matonabbee told him that women had to carry everything with them on their long trips across the sub-arctic because \\"...when all the men are heavy laden, they can neither hunt nor travel any considerable distance\\". Perry cautioned that when Hearne traveled though the sub-arctic in 1768‚Äì1772, the Chipewyan had been trading with the Hudson's Bay Company directly since 1717, and indirectly via the Cree for at least the last 90 years, so the life-styles he observed among the Chipewyan had been altered by the fur trade, and in no way can be considered a pre-contact life style. But Perry argued that the arduous nature of these trips across the sub-arctic together with the burden of carrying everything suggests that the Chipewyan women did not voluntarily submit to this regime, which would suggest that even in the pre-contact period that Chipewyan women had a low status. =Gwich'in: changes in status of women= When fur traders first contacted the Gwich'in in 1810 when they founded Fort Good Hope on the Mackenzie river, accounts describe a more or less egalitarian society, but the impact of the fur trade lowered the status of Gwich'in women. Accounts by the fur traders in the 1860s describe Gwich'in women as essentially slaves, carrying the baggage on their long journeys across the sub-arctic. One fur trader wrote about the Gwich'in women that they were \\"little better than slaves\\" while another fur trader wrote about the \\"brutal treatment\\" that Gwich'in women suffered at the hands of their men. Gwich'in band leaders who became rich by First Nations standards by engaging in the fur trade tended to have several wives, and indeed tended to monopolize the women in their bands. This caused serious social tensions, as Gwich'in young men found it impossible to have a mate, as their leaders took all of the women for themselves. Significantly, the establishment of fur trading posts inland by the Hudson's Bay Company in the late 19th century led to an improvement in the status of Gwich'in women as anyone could obtain European goods by trading at the local HBC post, ending the ability of Gwich'in leaders to monopolize the distribution of European goods while the introduction of dogs capable of carrying sleds meant their women no longer had to carry everything on their long trips. Delivery of goods by native tribes Perry argued that the crucial difference between the Northern Athabaskan peoples living in the sub-arctic vs. those living further south like the Cree and Ojibwe was the existence of waterways that canoes could traverse in the case of the latter. In the 18th century, Cree and Ojibwe men could and did travel hundreds of miles to HBC posts on Hudson's Bay via canoe to sell fur and bring back European goods, and in the interim, their women were in largely in charge of their communities. At York Factory in the 18th century, the factors reported that flotillas of up to 200 canoes would arrive at a time bearing Indian men coming to barter their fur for HBC's goods. Normally, the trip to York Factory was made by the Cree and Ojibwe men while their womenfolk stayed behind in their villages. Until 1774, the Hudson's Bay Company was content to operate its posts on the shores of Hudson's Bay, and only competition from the rival North West Company based in Montreal forced the Hudson's Bay Company to assert its claim to Rupert's Land. By contrast, the absence of waterways flowing into Hudson's Bay (the major river in the subarctic, the Mackenzie, flows into the Arctic Ocean) forced the Northern Athabaskan peoples to travel by foot with the women as baggage carriers. In this way, the fur trade empowered Cree and Ojibwe women while reducing the Northern Athabaskan women down to a slave-like existence. English colonies By the end of the 18th century the four major British fur trading outposts were Fort Niagara in modern New York, Fort Detroit and Fort Michilimackinac in modern Michigan, and Grand Portage in modern Minnesota, all located in the Great Lakes region. The American Revolution and the resulting resolution of national borders forced the British to re-locate their trading centers northward. The newly formed United States began its own attempts to capitalize on the fur trade, initially with some success. By the 1830s the fur trade had begun a steep decline, and fur was never again the lucrative enterprise it had once been. Company formationNew Netherland CompanyHudson's Bay CompanyNorth West CompanyMissouri Fur CompanyAmerican Fur CompanyRussian-American Company=Fur trade in the western United StatesMontanaMountain menGreat plainsPacific coast= On the Pacific coast of North America, the fur trade mainly pursued seal and sea otter. In northern areas, this trade was established first by the Russian-American Company, with later participation by Spanish/Mexican, British, and U.S. hunters/traders. Non-Russians extended fur-hunting areas south as far as the Baja California Peninsula.  Southeastern fur trade  Background = Starting in the mid-16th century, Europeans traded weapons and household goods in exchange for furs with Native Americans in southeast America. The trade originally tried to mimic the fur trade in the north, with large quantities of wildcats, bears, beavers, and other fur bearing animals being traded. The trade in fur coat animals decreased in the early 18th century, curtailed by the rising popularity of trade in deerskins. The deerskin trade went onto dominate the relationships between the Native Americans of the southeast and the European settlers there. Deerskin was a highly valued commodity due to the deer shortage in Europe, and the British leather industry needed deerskins to produce goods. The bulk of deerskins were exported to Great Britain during the peak of the deerskin trade. = Effect of the deerskin trade on Native Americans = Native American‚Äîspecifically the Creek's‚Äîbeliefs revolved around respecting the environment. The Creek believed they had a unique relationship with the animals they hunted. The Creek had several rules surround how a hunt could occur, particularly prohibiting needless killing of deer. There were specific taboos against taking the skins of unhealthy deer. But the lucrative deerskin trade prompted hunters to act past the point of restraint they had operated under before. The hunting economy collapsed due to the scarcity of deer as they were over-hunted and lost their lands to white settlers. Due to the decline of deer populations, and the governmental pressure to switch to the colonists' way of life, animal husbandry replaced deer hunting both as an income and in the diet. Rum was first introduced in the early 1700s as a trading item, and quickly became an inelastic good. While Native Americans were for the most part acted conservatively in trading deals, they consumed a surplus of alcohol. Traders used rum to help form partnerships. Rum had a significant effect on the social behavior of Native Americans. Under the influence of rum, the younger generation did not obey the elders of the tribe, and became involved with more skirmishes with other tribes and white settlers. Rum also disrupted the amount of time the younger generation of males spent on labor. Alcohol was one of the goods provided on credit, and led to a debt trap for many Native Americans. Native Americans did not know how to distill alcohol, and thus were driven to trade for it. Native Americans had become dependent on manufactured goods such as guns and domesticated animals, and lost much of their traditional practices. With the new cattle herds roaming the hunting lands, and a greater emphasis on farming due to the invention of the Cotton Gin, Native Americans struggled to maintain their place in the economy. An inequality gap had appeared in the tribes, as some hunters were more successful than others. Still, the creditors treated an individual's debt as debt of the whole tribe, and used several strategies to keep the Native Americans in debt. Traders would rig the weighing system that determined the value of the deerskins in their favor, cut measurement tools to devalue the deerskin, and would tamper with the manufactured goods to decrease their worth, such as watering down the alcohol they traded. To satisfy the need for deerskins, many males of the tribes abandoned their traditional seasonal roles and became full-time traders. When the deerskin trade collapsed, Native Americans found themselves dependent on manufactured goods, and could not return to the old ways due to lost knowledge. = Post-European contact in the 16th and 17th centuries = Spanish exploratory parties in the 1500s had violent encounters with the powerful chiefdoms, which led to the decentralization of the indigenous people in the southeast. Almost a century passed between the original Spanish exploration and the next wave of European immigration, which allowed the survivors of the European diseases to organize into new tribes. Most Spanish trade was limited with Indians on the coast until expeditions inland in the beginning of the 17th century. By 1639, substantial trade between the Spanish in Florida and the Native Americans for deerskins developed, with more interior tribes incorporated into the system by 1647. Many tribes throughout the southeast began to send trading parties to meet with the Spanish in Florida, or used other tribes as middlemen to obtain manufactured goods. The Apalachees used the Apalachiola people to collect deerskins, and in return the Apalachees would give them silver, guns, or horses. As the English and French colonizers ventured into the southeast, the deerskin trade experienced a boom going into the 18th century. Many of the English colonists who settled in the Carolinas in the late 1600s came from Virginia, where trading patterns of European goods in exchange for beaver furs already had started. The white- tailed deer herds that roamed south of Virginia were a more profitable resource. The French and the English struggled for control over Southern Appalachia and the Mississippi Valley, and needed alliances with the Indians there to maintain dominance. The European colonizers used the trade of deerskins for manufactured goods to secure trade relationships, and therefore power. = Beginning of the 18th century = At the beginning of the 18th century, more organized violence than in previous decades occurred between the Native Americans involved in the deerskin trade and white settlers, most famously the Yamasee War. This uprising of Indians against fur traders almost wiped out the European colonists in the southeast. The British promoted competition between tribes, and sold guns to both Creeks and Cherokees. This competition sprang out of the slave demand in the southeast ‚Äì tribes would raid each other and sell prisoners into the slave trade of the colonizers. France tried to outlaw these raids because their allies, the Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Yazoos, bore the brunt of the slave trade. Guns and other modern weapons were essential trading items for the Native Americans to protect themselves from slave raids; motivation which drove the intensity of the deerskin trade. The need for Indian slaves decreased as African slaves began to be imported in larger quantities, and the focus returned to deerskins. The drive for Indian slaves also was diminished after the Yamasee War to avoid future uprisings. The Yamasees had collected extensive debt in the first decade of the 1700s due to buying manufactured goods on credit from traders, and then not being able to produce enough deerskins to pay the debt later in the year. Indians who were not able to pay their debt were often enslaved. The practice of enslavement extended to the wives and children of the Yamasees in debt as well. This process frustrated the Yamasees and other tribes, who lodged complaints against the deceitful credit-loaning scheme traders had enforced, along with methods of cheating or trade. The Yamasees were a coastal tribe in the area that is now known as South Carolina, and most of the white-tailed deer herds had moved inland for the better environment. The Yamasees rose up against the English in South Carolina, and soon other tribes joined them, creating combatants from almost every nation in the South. The British were able to defeat the Indian coalition with help from the Cherokees, cementing a pre-existing trade partnership. After the uprisings, the Native Americans returned to making alliances with the European powers, using political savvy to get the best deals by playing the three nations off each other. The Creeks were particularly good at manipulation ‚Äì they had begun trading with South Carolina in the last years of the 17th century and became a trusted deerskin provider. The Creeks were already a wealthy tribe due to their control over the most valuable hunting lands, especially when compared to the impoverished Cherokees. Due to allying with the British during the Yamasee War, the Cherokees lacked Indian trading partners and could not break with Britain to negotiate with France or Spain. = Mississippi river valley = From their bases in the Great Lakes area, the French steadily pushed their way down the Mississippi river valley to the Gulf of Mexico from 1682 onward. Initially, French relations with the Natchez Indians were friendly and in 1716 the French were allowed to establish Fort Rosalie (modern Natchez, Mississippi) on the Natchez territory. In 1729, following several cases of French land fraud, the Natchez burned down Fort Rosalie and killed about 200 French settlers. In response, the French together with their allies, the Choctaw, waged a near-genocidal campaign against the Natchez as French and Choctaw set out to eliminate the Natchez as a people with the French often burning alive all of the Natchez they captured. Following the French victory over the Natchez in 1731 which resulted in the destruction of the Natchez people, the French were able to begin fur trading down the Arkansas river and greatly expanded the Arkansas Post to take advantage of the fur trade. = Mid-18th century = Deerskin trade was at its most profitable in the mid-18th century. The Creeks rose up as the largest deerskin supplier, and the increase in supply only intensified European demand for deerskins. Native Americans continued to negotiate the most lucrative trade deals by forcing England, France, and Spain to compete for their supply of deerskins. In the 1750s and 1760s, the Seven Years' War disrupted France's ability to provide manufactures goods to its allies, the Choctaws and Chickasaw. The French and Indian War further disrupted trade, as the British blockaded French goods. The Cherokees allied themselves with France, who were driven out from the southeast in accordance with the Treaty of Paris in 1763. The British were now the dominant trading power in the southeast. While both the Cherokee and the Creek were the main trading partners of the British, their relationships with the British were different. The Creeks adapted to the new economic trade system, and managed to hold onto their old social structures. Originally Cherokee land was divided into five districts but the number soon grew to thirteen districts with 200 hunters assigned per district due to deerskin demand. Charleston and Savannah were the main trading ports for the export of deerskins. Deerskins became the most popular export, and monetarily supported the colonies with the revenue produced by taxes on deerskins. Charleston's trade was regulated by the Indian Trade Commission, composed of traders who monopolized the market and profited off the sale of deerskins. From the beginning of the 18th century to mid-century, the deerskin exports of Charleston more than doubled in exports. Charleston received tobacco and sugar from the West Indies and rum from the North in exchange for deerskins. In return for deerskins, Great Britain sent woolens, guns, ammunition, iron tools, clothing, and other manufactured goods that were traded to the Native Americans. = Post- Revolutionary War = The Revolutionary War disrupted the deerskin trade, as the import of British manufactured goods with cut off. The deerskin trade had already begun to decline due to over-hunting of deer. The lack of trade caused the Native Americans to run out of items, such as guns, on which they depended. Some Indians, such as the Creeks, tried to reestablish trade with the Spanish in Florida, where some loyalists were hiding as well. When the war ended with the British retreating, many tribes who had fought on their side were now left unprotected and now had to make peace and new trading deals with the new country. Many Native Americans were subject to violence from the new Americans who sought to settle their territory. The new American government negotiated treaties that recognized prewar borders, such as those with the Choctaw and Chickasaw, and allowed open trade. In the two decades following the Revolutionary War, the United States' government established new treaties with the Native Americans the provided hunting grounds and terms of trade. But the value of deerskins dropped as domesticated cattle took over the market, and many tribes soon found themselves in debt. The Creeks began to sell their land to the government to try and pay their debts, and infighting among the Indians made it easy for white settlers to encroach upon their lands. The government also sought to encourage Native Americans to give up their old ways of subsistence hunting, and turn to farming and domesticated cattle for trade.  Social and cultural impact  The fur trade and its actors has played a certain role in films and popular culture. It was the topic of various books and films, from James Fenimore Cooper via Irving Pichels Hudson's Bay of 1941, the popular Canadian musical My Fur Lady (music by Galt MacDermot) of 1957, till Nicolas Vaniers documentaries. In contrast to \\"the huddy buddy narration of Canada as Hudson's country\\", propagated either in popular culture as well in elitist circles as the Beaver Club, founded 1785 in Montreal the often male-centered scholarly description of the fur business does not fully describe the history. Chantal Nadeau, a communication scientist in Montreal's Concordia University refers to the \\"country wives\\" and \\"country marriages\\" between Indian women and European trappers and the Filles du Roy of the 18th century. Nadeau says that women have been described as a sort of commodity, \\"skin for skin\\", and they were essential to the sustainable prolongation of the fur trade. Nadeau describes fur as an essential, \\"the fabric\\" of Canadian symbolism and nationhood. She notes the controversies around the Canadian seal hunt, with Brigitte Bardot as a leading figure. Bardot, a famous actress, had been a model in the 1971 \\"Legend\\" campaign of the US mink label Blackglama, for which she posed nude in fur coats. Her involvement in anti-fur campaigns shortly afterward was in response to a request by the noted author Marguerite Yourcenar, who asked Bardot to use her celebrity status to help the anti- sealing movement. Bardot had successes as an anti-fur activist and changed from sex symbol to the grown-up mama of \\"white seal babies\\". Nadeau related this to her later involvement in French right-wing politics. The anti-fur movement in Canada was intertwined with the nation's exploration of history during and after the Quiet Revolution in Quebec, until the roll back of the anti-fur movement in the late 1990s. Finally, the PETA celebrity campaign: \\"I'd rather go naked than wear fur\\", turned around the \\"skin for skin\\" motto and symbology against fur and the fur trade. =M√©tis people= As men from the old fur trade in the Northeast made the trek west in the early nineteenth century, they sought to recreate the economic system from which they had profited in the Northeast. Some men went alone but others relied on companies like the Hudson Bay Company and the Missouri Fur Company. Marriage and kinship with native women would play an important role in the western fur trade. White traders who moved west needed to establish themselves in the kinship networks of the tribes, and they often did this by marrying a prominent Indian woman. This practice was called a \\"country\\" marriage and allowed the trader to network with the adult male members of the woman's band, who were necessary allies for trade. The children of these unions, who were known as M√©tis, were an integral part of the fur trade system. The M√©tis label defined these children as a marginal people with a fluid identity. Early on in the fur trade, M√©tis were not defined by their racial category, but rather by the way of life they chose. These children were generally the offspring of white men and Native mothers and were often raised to follow the mother's lifestyle. The father could influence the enculturation process and prevent the child from being classified as M√©tis in the early years of the western fur trade. Fur families often included displaced native women who lived near forts and formed networks among themselves. These networks helped to create kinship between tribes which benefitted the traders. Catholics tried their best to validate these unions through marriages. But missionaries and priests often had trouble categorizing the women, especially when establishing tribal identity. M√©tis were among the first groups of fur traders who came from the Northeast. These men were mostly of a mixed race identity, largely Iroquois, as well as other tribes from the Ohio country. Rather than one tribal identity, many of these M√©tis had multiple Indian heritages. Lewis and Clark, who opened up the market on the fur trade in the Upper Missouri, brought with them many M√©tis to serve as engag√©s. These same M√©tis would become involved in the early western fur trade. Many of them settled on the Missouri River and married into the tribes there before setting up their trade networks. The first generation of M√©tis born in the West grew up out of the old fur trade and provided a bridge to the new western empire. These M√©tis possessed both native and European skills, spoke multiple languages, and had the important kinship networks required for trade. In addition, many spoke the Michif M√©tis dialect. In an effort to distinguish themselves from natives, many M√©tis strongly associated with Roman Catholic beliefs and avoided participating in native ceremonies. By the 1820s, the fur trade had expanded into the Rocky Mountains where American and British interests begin to compete for control of the lucrative trade. The M√©tis would play a key role in this competition. The early M√©tis congregated around trading posts where they were employed as packers, laborers, or boatmen. Through their efforts they helped to create a new order centered on the trading posts. Other M√©tis traveled with the trapping brigades in a loose business arrangement where authority was taken lightly and independence was encouraged. By the 1830s Canadians and Americans were venturing into the West to secure a new fur supply. Companies like the NWC and the HBC provided employment opportunities for M√©tis. By the end of the 19th century, many companies considered the M√©tis to be Indian in their identity. As a result, many M√©tis left the companies in order to pursue freelance work. After 1815 the demand for bison robes began to rise gradually, although the beaver still remained the primary trade item. The 1840s saw a rise in the bison trade as the beaver trade begin to decline. Many M√©tis adapted to this new economic opportunity. This change of trade item made it harder for M√©tis to operate within companies like the HBC, but this made them welcome allies of the Americans who wanted to push the British to the Canada‚ÄìUS border. Although the M√©tis would initially operate on both sides of the border, by the 1850s they were forced to pick an identity and settle either north or south of the border. The period of the 1850s was thus one of migration for the M√©tis, many of whom drifted and established new communities or settled within existing Canadian, American or Indian communities. A group of M√©tis who identified with the Chippewa moved to the Pembina in 1819 and then to the Red River area in 1820, which was located near St. Fran√ßois Xavier in Manitoba. In this region they would establish several prominent fur trading communities. These communities had ties to one another through the NWC. This relationship dated back to between 1804 and 1821 when M√©tis men had served as low level voyageurs, guides, interpreters, and contre-maitres, or foremen. It was from these communities that M√©tis buffalo hunters operating in the robe trade arose. The M√©tis would establish a whole economic system around the bison trade. Whole M√©tis families were involved in the production of robes, which was the driving force of the winter hunt. In addition, they sold pemmican at the posts. Unlike Indians, the M√©tis were dependent on the fur trade system and subject to the market. The international prices of bison robes were directly influential on the well-being of M√©tis communities. By contrast, the local Indians had a more diverse resource base and were less dependent on Americans and Europeans at this time. By the 1850s the fur trade had expanded across the Great Plains, and the bison robe trade began to decline. The M√©tis had a role in the depopulation of the bison. Like the Indians, the M√©tis had a preference for cows, which meant that the bison had trouble maintaining their herds. In addition, flood, drought, early frost, and the environmental impact of settlement posed further threats to the herds. Traders, trappers, and hunters all depended on the bison to sustain their way of life. The M√©tis tried to maintain their lifestyle through a variety of means. For instance, they often used two wheel carts made from local materials, which meant that they were more mobile than Indians and thus were not dependent on following seasonal hunting patterns. The 1870s brought an end to the bison presence in the Red River area. M√©tis communities like those at Red River or Turtle Mountain were forced to relocate to Canada and Montana. An area of resettlement was the Judith Basin in Montana, which still had a population of bison surviving in the early 1880s. By the end of decade the bison were gone, and M√©tis hunters relocated back to tribal lands. They wanted to take part in treaty negotiations in the 1880s, but they had questionable status with tribes such as the Chippewa. Many former M√©tis bison hunters tried to get land claims during the treaty negotiations in 1879‚Äì1880. They were reduced to squatting on Indian land during this time and collecting bison bones for $15‚Äì20 a ton in order to purchase supplies for the winter. The reservation system did not ensure that the M√©tis were protected and accepted as Indians. To further complicate matters, M√©tis had a questionable status as citizens and were often deemed incompetent to give court testimonies and denied the right to vote. The end of the bison robe trade was the end of the fur trade for many M√©tis. This meant that they had to reestablish their identity and adapt to a new economic world. Modern day Modern fur trapping and trading in North America is part of a wider $15 billion global fur industry where wild animal pelts make up only 15 percent of total fur output. In 2008, the global recession hit the fur industry and trappers especially hard with greatly depressed fur prices thanks to a drop in the sale of expensive fur coats and hats. Such a drop in fur prices reflects trends of previous economic downturns. In 2013, the North American Fur Industry Communications group (NAFIC) was established as a cooperative public educational program for the fur industry in Canada and the USA.

It arose from the Parisian actor and theatre director Ren√© Charles Guilbert de Pix√©r√©court and premiered on 18 June 1814 as Le Chien de Montargis, ou la For√™t de Bondy, m√©lodrame historique en trois actes et √† grand spectacle at the Parisian Th√©√¢tre de la Ga√Æt√© on Boulevard du Temple, where it had an uninterrupted run in that theatre's repertoire until 1834. Like many melodramas, it had several English language adaptations. John Fawcett, manager of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, applied on September 17, 1814 for a license to present a two-act adaptation by William Barrymore, originally titled Murder Will Out with the alternate and more commonly used title The Dog of Montargis, or, The Forest of Bondy. The first performance was September 30. Other adaptations followed, including an 1816 three-act version attributed to Sir Henry Bishop, and a two-act version by Thomas Dibdin. Versions were performed at many playhouses in London and in the United States throughout the nineteenth century. A German translation by Ignaz Franz Castelli, with music by Ignaz von Seyfried, premiered on 4 October 1815 at Berlin's K√∂nigliche Schauspiele. It already had a competitor in Vienna in September 1815, with Joseph August Adam's Der Hund des Aubri de Montdidier, oder der Zweikampf auf der Insel Notre-Dame. Ein romantisches Schauspiel in vier Aufz√ºgen, but this did not become generally accepted alongside Castelli and Pix√©r√©court's version, and the piece soon spread throughout Europe, even being given at Weimar for the great dog-lover Charles Augustus starring Charles Augustus's lover Karoline Jagemann. Historical Context Pixerecourt published Le Chien de Montargis in 1814, less than twenty years after the end of the French Revolution. An event of this magnitude comes with extreme cultural implications. The French Revolution is notable historically for its unprecedented, widespread, and extreme violence, and because of this the French culture adopted a new value for justice, law, and stability in the years following. Prominent themes in French culture in these following years were ‚Äúthe search for both stability and legitimacy through adopting the rule of law and the centrality of exceptional measures that violated the rule of law in order to defend and impose the republic‚Äù (Brown 11). Ironically, a new love for the law became a great ideal and rallying point of the revolution. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose ideas heavily influenced the French Revolution, stated that ‚Äúeverything depended fundamentally on politics,‚Äù seeming to claim that ‚Äúpolitics, rather than custom, morals, or religion, was the root of social life‚Äù (Hunt 1). This was a common ideal throughout the revolution, and part of the reason for the intense violence. People rallied behind this idea of equality and justice through law. They would no longer stand for what sociologist Max Weber would call Traditional Authority, in which they accepted orders from a king who claimed power from God and the oppressions of a class structure they could never escape simply because that was how it had always been done (Edles and Appelrouth). The logic and reason of the enlightenment prevailed and told them that the world functions through rules and laws, and they wanted these rules and laws to apply to everyone. This new culture that valued law, order, and justice was a perfect stage for melodramas. The people loved the idea that justice would always prevail, as well as the common plotpoint of physical and undeniable evidence being what condemns the villain figure. It is easy to see the reason for the success of melodramas following the French Revolution, as they almost always included ‚Äúincessant struggle against enemies, without and within, branded as villains, suborners of morality, who must be confronted and expunged, over and over, to assure the triumph of virtue‚Äù (Brooks 15). The values of melodrama that grew out of enlightenment ideals ended up flourishing in the new French culture and contributed greatly to Pixerecourt‚Äôs tremendous success. Summary The plot is based on a legend from the 14th century, that survived in a letter from Julius Caesar Scaliger. According to the legend: \\"A French courtier of King Charles V (1338‚Äì80), Aubry de Montdidier, was murdered c. 1371 in the forest of Bondy, north of Paris. The only witness to De Montdidier‚Äôs murder was his dog, which pursued the perpetrator until he was captured; the murderer was Robert Macaire. The king ordered that Macaire, armed with a stick, and the dog should fight a duel, which took place on the Isle de Notre Dame. The dog won: Macaire confessed and was hanged.\\" (Pickeral 134) The best-known version, allegedly by Michel de Montaigne, was recorded as a handwritten note in a copy of his Essais (Apology for Raimond de Sebond, livre II/12, where Plutarch quoted a story about the dog); but this is certainly a forgery.http://perso.orange.fr/gatinais.histoire/Chien_de_Montargis.htm (French) Pix√©r√©court gives eight sources for its dramatisation, including Jean-Baptiste de La Curne de Sainte-Palaye and Philippe-Auguste de Sainte- Foix.Guilbert de Pix√©r√©court, Th√©√¢tre choisi, Paris: Tresse 1842, vol. 3 p.119 A statue of the fight is a landmark in the French community of Montargis. Dramatisation The Dog of Montarges tells the story of a falsely accused mute and his acquittal. The play is part of a dramatic tradition known as melodrama, a genre that aims to connect with an audience at an emotional, visceral and sentimental level. A play in this tradition strives to show human emotions, and is therefore not given to subtlety in language or hidden ironies. It is also largely dependent on theatrical gestures that convey emotions that words cannot. In the play, Dame Gertrude oversees an inn at which Eloi, Ursula and Bertrand work. They must entertain a group of soldiers (members of a higher class than that of the inn keepers) who have returned from battle. Upon the arrival of these soldiers, Colonel Gontram, Captain Aubri and the Lieutenants Macaire and Landry, the audience quickly learns that Aubri has been promoted to Captain and given the hand of the general's daughter in marriage. Macaire and Landry are jealous, and plot his downfall. That night, in the Forest of Bondy, through which Aubri with his dog, Dragon, is passing to deliver a packet on behalf of the Colonel, Macaire and Landry attack and murder Aubri. They bury his body, confident that nobody witnessed the crime. Dragon runs away and Macaire and Landry flee the scene. The next morning, Eloi, the mute worker at the inn who is betrothed to Ursula, is accused of the murder of Aubri because he (Eloi) is found with a pocketbook full of gold that belonged to Aubri. Aubri had, in fact, given this gold to Eloi so that Eloi could deliver it to Aubri's mother in Paris in the event that anything were to happen to Aubri during his dangerous night journey through Bondy. The circumstantial evidence is taken to prove Eloi's guilt, and Eloi, mute and unable to defend himself, is condemned to death. A series of events then clears Eloi's name. A sash is found by the dog Dragon near Aubri's body in the Forest of Bondy that belongs to a member of the visiting regiment. Urusula concludes that whoever does not have a sash is the murderer. However, Macaire, to whom the sash belongs, takes another sash from the body of Aubri and uses it to feign his innocence. Finally, Ursula sees the sword in Macaire's scabbard. She takes it out and says that she gave the knot of thread tied around the sword to Aubri. Macaire, succumbing to his conscience, admits his guilt and is condemned to death. He incriminates Landry, who tries to escape, but is chased and mauled by Dragon. The success of the theatrical version resulted from a trained dog with a silent role, which allowed a pantomime actor to portray the silent servant Eloi accused of murdering his master Aubry. He can defend himself, but due to his disability does not.Pix√©r√©court, Le Chien de Montargis, acte II, sc√®ne 10; p.166f In the end he needs help from Aubry's dog Dragon, which is also mute. The dramatisation does not end in a fight like the legend; the mythical narrative is replaced by a search for clues like a modern detective story. The dog is killed by Aubry's foes, but the murderer is recognized by using a belt with which he had tied the dog on the scene. The name for the breed, Briard, is sometimes called Chien d'Aubry, so it is suggested that a trained Briard may have been used in the role of the dog in Pix√©r√©court's version. For the first German performances, a Viennese actor named Karsten with his trained poodles was used. Consequences This is the first instance in which we see a dog having a significant role in a play. The dog playing the role of Dragon would be trained to ring a bell, go to certain areas of the stage on command, and perform other tricks that would please the audience and satisfy the plot. This is an early indication of a shared discomfort of an innocent dog being killed, and interest in prevention of animal cruelty. New laws and royal decrees against animal cruelty were being passed, and by 1835, bullbaiting was outlawed. These patterns that begun with Pixerecourt‚Äôs play have continued throughout time. From this show came the true domestication of dogs, and later other animals, holding people to a higher standard with their treatment of animals. These revised versions often held variations of the title, ‚ÄúThe Forrest of Bondy.‚Äù Carl Friedrich Zelter wanted to offer the Berlin premiere something positive. At the instigation of actress Karoline Jagemann, the melodrama was performed at the Weimar court theatre of the Grand Duke Charles Augustus, in April 1817. Because Goethe's opposition to this performance was unsuccessful, he asked to be dismissed from the theatre. The aristocratic fondness for dogs and horses stood in direct competition with civic education aspirations since the 18th century. The piece was parodied by Joachim Perinet (Dragon, der Hund des Aubry oder: Der Wienerwald, 1816) and Pius Alexander Wolff (Der Hund des Aubry. Posse in einem Aufzug, 1818). Goethe's departure from the theatre was in turn dramatised as Der Hund des Aubri. Ein Zeitbild (1869) by Albert Lindner. 1909 a silent movie was made by Georges Monca for Path√© after a script by Romain Coolus. In 1943, a lecture by Gustaf Gr√ºndgens in front of the Nazi National Association of Artists promoted a nationalist, particularly anti-French, condemnation of the piece. Adaptations of the play emerged in England in the 19th century due to Victorian society having a \\"shared discomfort with the idea of an innocent dog being killed.\\" (Recarte) Bibliography *Brooks, Peter.

At the age of twenty, in 1793, Pixer√©court abandoned his studies of law and left Nancy \\"on the day of the King's death\\" to meet his father at Koblenz and enter the Breton regiment as an officer in the army of Cond√©. At the end of the year he returned to France to make his fortune, entering via Nancy and arriving in Paris on 27 February 1794 at the height of the Reign of Terror. After the denunciations of the Committee of Public Safety, Pixer√©court owed his life to the protection of Lazare Carnot who, for nearly two years, employed him as a secretary in the Ministry of War. He then obtained two posts, one in the Administration of Domains and another in that of Registrations, both of which he was to retain for thirty years and which allowed him, particularly at the beginning, the pursuit of a career in the theatre. He would eventually become director of the Th√©√¢tre royal de l‚ÄôOp√©ra-Comique (from 1824 to 1827) and of the Th√©√¢tre de l'Ambigu-Comique. The general mistrust of ex-√©migr√©s prompted him to take the pseudonym of \\"Charles\\" for his first works. He had taken only one book with him into exile: the Nouvelles of Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian, which gave him the subject of his first two plays: S√©lico ou les N√®gres g√©n√©reux (\\"S√©lico, or The Magnanimous Slaves\\"), purchased by the Th√©√¢tre- Fran√ßais, and Claudine ou l‚ÄôAnglais vertueux (\\"Claudine, or the Virtuous Englishman\\"), taken up by Salle Favart. His first great success came in 1800 with C≈ìlina ou l‚ÄôEnfant du myst√®re (\\"Coelina, or The Child of Mystery\\"). The following year, in April, Le P√®lerin blanc ou les Enfants du hameau (\\"The White Pilgrim, or the Children of the Village\\") ran for 386 performances at L‚ÄôAmbigu. This was nearly beaten by L'Homme √† trois visages (\\"The Man With Three Faces\\") which ran for 378 nights at the same theatre. In September 1802, La Femme √† deux maris (\\"The Wife With Two Husbands\\") continued his good fortune. In 1803, T√©k√©li, performed by Tantin and Mme Bourgeois, broke his previous record with a run of 430 nights. In 1805, La Forteresse du Danube and Robinson Cruso√© ran for a whole year at the Porte-Saint-Martin. Costume sketch for the actor Ferdinand in the r√¥le of the Tsar in La Fille de l'exil√©, given at the Th√©√¢tre de la Ga√Æt√©, 13 March 1819 In 1809, he began writing for the Th√©√¢tre de la Ga√Æt√©, his first play there being La Citerne; on 30 October 1810, his first hit was Les Ruines de Babylone. From then until 1814, his success continued, with a major triumph in the June of that year with Le Chien de Montargis (400 performances). In 1815, after the total failure of Christophe Colomb, he regained success with Le Monast√®re abandonn√© ou la Mal√©diction paternelle (\\"The Abandoned Monastery, or the Paternal Curse\\") which lasted 267 performances. And in 1818, still at La Ga√Æt√©, Le Belv√©d√®re ou la Vall√©e de l‚ÄôEtna (\\"The Belvedere, or the Valley of Etna\\") owed its success not just to the playwright but also to the magnificent art direction of Louis Daguerre who contributed the volcanic backdrop. In 1819, he returned to L‚ÄôAmbigu with La Fille de l‚ÄôExil√© ou Huit mois en deux heures (\\"The Exile's Daughter, or Eight Months and Two Hours\\"). From 1820, his successes continued, albeit with around a hundred performances for each play: Le Drapeau blanc (\\"The White Flag\\", 1821), Ali Baba ou les Quarante voleurs (\\"Ali Baba, or the Forty Thieves\\", 1822), Le Moulin des √âtangs (\\"The Mill\\", 1826), and La T√™te de mort ou les Ruines de Pomp√©i (\\"The Death's-Head, or the Ruins of Pompeii\\", 1827). Some plays were written in collaboration, like La Muette de la for√™t (\\"The Mute Girl of the Forest\\", 1828). His last play before retiring as director of the Op√©ra-Comique in 1827 would be Latude ou Trente-cinq ans de captivit√© (\\"Latude, or 35 Years of Captivity\\"), written with his young disciple Auguste Anicet-Bourgeois. For nearly forty years, he maintained his energetic activities as author, theatre director and government inspector. His immense success as a dramatic author led to him being dubbed the Corneille des Boulevards. Paul Lacroix recalled that Charles Nodier placed him in the first rank of authors of his generation. His reputation was almost as high in Russia, Germany, and England. His wealth allowed him to add many rare books to his library, the great passion of his life. A distich inscribed above the door read: Tel est le triste sort de tout livre pr√™t√©: Souvent il est perdu, toujours il est g√¢t√©. (\\"Such is the sad fate of every lent book: Often it is lost, always it is marred.\\") And inside each of his books, a slip of paper read: Un livre est un ami qui ne change jamais. (\\"A book is a friend who never changes.\\") On 21 February 1835, the Th√©√¢tre de la Ga√Æt√©, on the Boulevard du Temple, was completely destroyed by fire. His last play there was Bijou ou l‚ÄôEnfant de Paris (\\"Bijou, or the Child of Paris\\"): apparently firework effects were being tested during a dress rehearsal. The Th√©√¢tre de la Ga√Æt√© would however be reconstructed very rapidly, with metal frames, to reopen on 19 November, the reconstruction being overseen by Bernard L√©on who had only just bought the venue for 500 000 francs. (Nevertheless it would merge with L‚ÄôAmbigu only ten years later.) Pixer√©court won the day in court and avoided ruin. Although he was not the theatre's owner, he had lost an immense quantity of properties and scenery (estimated as worth 300,000 francs) which contributed greatly to the success of his dramatic presentations. The stress of the accident greatly damaged his health. Already a victim of kidneystones and gout, he had his first attack of apoplexy, and his eyesight began to fail. Around 1838, he left his Parisian \\"headquarters\\" at Fontenay-sous-Bois (a house which had belonged to his friend, the composer Nicolas Dalayrac, whose biography he had written) and retired to his birthplace, Nancy, possibly living in a house southeast of the town at Haussonville, le seul bien que m‚Äôait laiss√© ma famille (\\"the only property my family has left me\\"), where, greatly weakened, he set about editing his complete works. His Th√©√¢tre choisi was published at Nancy in four volumes from 1841 to 1843. He also published the catalogue of his library at Saint-Nicolas-de-Port. He had possessed more than 4000 volumes, purchased over many years for 100,000 francs, and the value of which had greatly increased when they were sold on 22 January 1839 at the Libraire Crozet, at Paris. One of his plays, La cisterne, served as the basis for Gaetano Donizetti's opera Chiara e Serafina. NotesBibliography * W. G.

E. planchonii is commonly found in the western highlands of Tasmania. The Ewartia genus is described as cushion plants/herbs due to the characteristic growth habits of low growing, highly compact mats which are made up of highly packed stems. These mats are slow-growing and are often located in soils that contain low nutrients. Description Ewartia planchonii is a sprawling herb which forms mat-like ground coverage over rocky alpine landscapes. Leaves are densely tufted, overlapping along the stem, obovately shaped and 3-6mm long. The leaves are also covered by soft hairs which whiten with age. Flowerheads are ovoid in shape and open up flat to 7-8mm long, brownish/ yellow and lack the usual petal-like bracts. Flowering occurs over the summer months to increase chances of pollination. Habitat and distribution Commonly found in locations of alpine/subalpine Tasmania, on exposed mountain slopes at around 1300m. E. planchonii's common vegetation type is microshrubbery/ herbfield being characterised by species which grow less than 10 cm in height but consists of a high species abundance. The plants which live in these habitats must be able to survive in high winds and temporary snow cover as well as high UV radiation during summer months. Soil of these habitats often contains peat to a shallow depth. Distribution of E. planchonii is mainly over the western province of Tasmania which outlying populations located in the Ben Lomond National Park in the states north east and Mt Wellington/ kunanyi close to Hobart. Threats and conservation Habitat of E. planchonii is widely protected in reserves and national parks across the state of Tasmania, but its main threat currently is the changing climate. Species in alpine areas are vulnerable to the advancing treeline, higher fire risk to peatlands due to the increase of dry lightning events and less annual rainfall. Increased distribution data and population monitoring will be crucial to facilitating the future conservation of this species. alt= Affinities There are 6 known species in the Ewartia genus. E. capites, E. meredithae and E. planchonii are all endemic to alpine areas of Tasmania. Whereas E. capites and E. argentifolia are found on the mainland of Australia. Differently E. sinclairi is endemic to the south island of New Zealand, while also preferring an alpine habitat, sinclairi grows to a sub-shrub height of 20-40 cm. E. capites is often located in the same regions as E. planchonii throughout Tasmania yet is known to flower later in summer than planchonii.

It is customary for Urdu poets to assume a pen-name (takhallus) that can be employed as a pun in the final couplet of every ghazal, often combined with a second name that denotes the poet's place of origin. In this case, \\"Bekhud\\", the pen- name means beside oneself (with joy or grief), out of one's mind; in ecstasy, transported, enraptured, intoxicated; senseless, delirious, commonly used in the context of spiritual ecstasy, and is paired with \\"Badayuni\\", which indicates ties to the city of Badayun. History Bekhud Badayuni's most recent biographer was Asad Ahmad of Aligarh Muslim University's Urdu Department, who drew upon the work of prior biographers, including Hasrat Mohani. Bekhud Badayuni was born on 17 September 1857 into Badayun's prominent Siddiqui family, known for its leadership in the areas of Islamic scholarship, mysticism (tasawwuf or \\"Sufism\\"), and literary pursuits. He was a descendant of the first Caliph, Abu Bakr; an intermediate ancestor, Hameeduddin Mukhlis, immigrated to Delhi from Iran in the late 13th century during the reign of Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban, and was the brother of Shaikh Saadi Shirazi, one of the seminal and most-quoted poets of Persian literature. Balban appointed Hameeduddin qadi-ul-quddat (literally \\"judge-of-judges\\", or Chief Justice) and granted him an extensive landholding in Badayun, at the time one of the key cities of the Delhi Sultanate. It is also reported that Hameeduddin presented Saadi's two major works, Golistan and Bostan, as a gift to Prince Muhammad Shaheed (Balban's favorite son, and patron - along with Balban - of the great poet, musician, and mystic Amir Khusro). Life Bekhud trained and qualified as a lawyer, and spent time practicing law in Muradabad and Shahjahanpur. Tiring of the practice of law, he eventually entered into government service, serving as a high official first in the princely state of Sirohi (in Rajasthan), then in the princely state of Jodhpur, where he spent the remainder of his days. He died in 1912 in Badayun. Influences Bekhud initially entered the tutelage of Maulana Altaf Hussain Hali, Ghalib's most renowned prot√©g√©; it was under Hali's guidance that Bekhud chose his pen-name. Around 1879, concurrent with the publication of Hali's Musaddas-e-Hali (considered the beginning of the modern age of Urdu poetry) and Hali's shift in focus away from traditional forms and subjects of poetry, Bekhud left Hali and became the disciple of Nawab Mirza Khan Daagh Dehlvi, the last of the great poets of the erstwhile Mughal court. Upon Daagh's death, many of his numerous disciples clamored for the honor of being his jaa-nasheen (successor to his title and reputation as the greatest living Urdu poet); in his own memoirs, Bekhud reproaches many of Daagh's disciples for the manner in which they squabbled, and himself chose to remain aloof from the debate. Despite Bekhud's own reticence, Dr. Asad Ahmad quotes a well-known anecdote relating that Daagh, when asked to name his jaa-nasheen, replied, \\"Bekhud-ain [the two Bekhuds]\\", referring to Bekhud Badayuni and Bekhud Dehlvi (a fellow student of Daagh). Poetry Much of Bekhud's poetry has fallen out of contemporary discourse, for a variety of reasons. In part, this circumstance is due to Bekhud's own reticence and limited publication of his works. He did not publish his collection of poetry (diwan) until 1910 (two years before his death) despite having compiled the bulk of it as early as fifteen years prior. Biographers and critics have speculated that even this late publication of Bekhud's work occurred primarily to combat the plagiarism and misappropriation of his poetic works by other poets (since, short of publication, oral transmission is the primary medium for Urdu poetry). Bekhud's residence in Jodhpur, isolated from the main centers of Urdu literature in Delhi and Lucknow, also limited the circulation of his work and provided the opportunity for some of Bekhud's contemporaries in the centers of literature to pass his work off as their own. For this reason, much of his work has grown unfamiliar to the current generation of Urdu speakers, despite having been integral to any serious poet's or critic's study of Urdu poetry until late into the 20th century. At the same time, several of his works have been mis-attributed to Bekhud Dehlvi or other poets of his time.

Among the listeners, to the right, is Goethe. The Weimar Princely Free Drawing School () was an art and literature educational establishment. It was set up in 1776 in Weimar by the scholar and ducal private-secretary Friedrich Justin Bertuch (1747‚Äì1822) and the painter Georg Melchior Kraus (1737‚Äì1806), as part of Weimar Classicism. It was financed by the young Charles Augustus, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and heavily promoted by Goethe, who also taught there. Among its pupils were Charles Augustus's future mistress Karoline Jagemann. It lasted until 1930. As Weimar's Geheimer Rat had oversight over the school from 1788 to 1832, it is not to be confused with the (set up in 1860), the original version of the Weimarer Kunsthochschule. The school's classrooms were originally housed in the , moving into the in 1807 and later moving partly to the Esplanade and partly to the Gro√üen J√§gerhaus.In the Second World War the middle class moved from the ‚Äî the in 3 ‚Äî to the newly built From 1824/25, under the oversight of custodian and painter Louise Seidler (1786‚Äì1866), it also housed the grand- ducal art collection. Aims The foundation of the school is a clear indication of the rising interest in arts and crafts in court circles in the second half of 18th century. Its immediate main aim was to instruct local craftsmen in drawing, to sharpen their sense of aesthetics in consumables and in the longer term to increase the quality of production in handcrafts. In order to disseminate art, taste and a sense of beauty to as wide a public as possible, the lessons and living quarters were open to all classes and both sexes. It was an important place for the discovery and promotion of new talent and drew many artists into the orbit of Weimar Classicism and its \\"\\". To complete its pupils' knowledge and artistic talents by comparison and copying, from 1809 the school also developed its own collection of major paintings, giving exhibitions from 1809, which were generally housed from 1824/25 in the . From 1837 the dissolved grand-ducal art collection was also put at the school's disposal.The gallery at the attempted to reconstruct the early phase of Weimar Classicism on the basis of a surviving inventory made by Johann Heinrich Meyer in 1824 in the exhibition in 2002 . The school's first annual exhibition, for the pupils to display their work publicly, was in 1779. The prize related to the exhibition was traditionally awarded on 3 September, the birthday of Charles Augustus. The school found a competitor in 1860 with the foundation of the , and from then until its dissolution in 1930 the school gave preparatory lessons for students entering the .

Raced extensively as a two-year-old, she won nine races and ¬£9429, but her form faltered in her late three and four-year-old seasons. Retired in 1884, Dutch Oven was not considered to be a success in the stud, but her offspring exported to Australia and Argentina did produce successful racehorses. Background Dutch Oven was foaled in 1879 at Lord Falmouth Mereworth Castle Stud in Maidstone, Kent. She was sired by Dutch Skater, a noted long-distance runner that was bred in France and had won the Prix Gladiateur and Doncaster Cup in 1872. Dutch Oven was the fourth foal of her dam, Cantiniere, which was bred by Lord Ailesbury and was herself a successful racehorse as a two-year-old, winning six races in seven starts, including the 1872 Ascot Biennial, Chesterfield Stakes and Lavant Stakes. However, by the time Lord Falmouth bought her after the death of Lord Ailesbury, she had developed into a roarer and was consequently judged to be a poor breeding prospect. In addition to Dutch Oven, Cantiniere produced her half-sister, Bal Gal, for Lord Falmouth, which won the 1880 Champagne Stakes and July Stakes. Dutch Oven was a brown mare with a white strip and two white heels. She was described as a \\"delicate\\" filly which had trouble maintaining weight and was subject to great variability in her racing performance. The name \\"Dutch Oven\\" resulted from a play on her parents' names and while credited at the time for being \\"neatly named\\", the choice was later assessed by historian Laura Thompson to be \\"possibly the least meaningful name ever given to a classic winner.\\" Dutch Oven was trained by Mathew Dawson at Newmarket. Racing career1881:two-year-old season= On 5 July at the Newmarket meeting, Dutch Oven ran a dead heat with the future-1000 Guineas winner St. Marguerite for third place in the July Stakes won by Kermesse. A few days later, she won the 700-sovereign Great Lancashire Yearling Stakes run at Manchester by three- quarters of a length over Mr. C. Perkin's colt Pursebearer. Ridden by Fred Archer in the 1172-guinea Richmond Stakes at Goodwood, Dutch Oven again faced St. Marguerite and Kermesse, ultimately winning by a head over St. Marguerite which dead heated with Kermesse for second place. Continuing her winning streak a few days later at the same meeting, she won the Rous Memorial Stakes by a length, beating Pursebearer while carrying . At Alexandra Park in August, she finished second by three-quarters of a length to Lord Rothschild's Nellie in the Prince of Wales' Stakes. Returning to racing on 1 September at Derby, Dutch Oven won the Champion Breeders' Foal Stakes, but was second to Kermesse by half a length in the Champagne Stakes run at Doncaster 13 days later. Recovering her form for the October meeting at Newmarket, Dutch Oven won the Triennial Produce Stakes going off at 100 to 30 odds, and she beat Nellie in the Rous Memorial Stakes and the Clearwell Stakes. In her final outing of the season at the Houghton meeting, she won the 300-sovereign Dewhurst Plate by a head. She won nine races and accrued ¬£9429. Fred Archer (pictured in Lord Falmouth's colours) was Dutch Oven's primary jockey during her racing career. =1882:three-year-old season= 1882 was an exceptional year in history of the British Classic races due to fillies winning all of the races in the Triple Crown, a feat usually accomplished by male horses. In her first race of the year, Dutch Oven competed in the 103rd Derby on 24 May in a field of 14 horses. A heavy rainstorm had saturated the track before the start of the race, but the weather had cleared by the time of the running. Going off at 8 to 1 odds, Dutch Oven never contended for the lead and was unplaced in the middle of the field. The race was won by the Duke of Westminister filly Shotover, which had won the 2,000 Guineas in April by two lengths in \\"wretchedly untoward\\" weather. In July at Goodwood, Dutch Oven was third to Comte Alfred and Battlefield for the Sussex Stakes. Running in field of only three horses, Dutch Oven won the mile and a quarter Yorkshire Oaks by three lengths over Actress and Confusion (who was jockeyed by her owner Mr. J. Osbourne). A few weeks before the St. Leger, Dutch Oven contended for the Great Yorkshire Stakes, losing to Peppermint and Nellie by four lengths. The St. Leger Following the Great Yorkshire, Dutch Oven's form significantly improved and she had made good time over three practice gallops in Newmarket before running in the St. Leger. But in the eyes of the public, Dutch Oven's lacklustre performance in the Great Yorkshire had decreased her stature in the betting pools and she factored at 40 to 1 in the morning line, considered a rank outsider. The 14-horse field, which included Shotover and the Oaks winner Geheimniss, consisted of 10 colts and 4 fillies. At the start, Dutch Oven was on the extreme right of the field and in the next to last position as the filly Actress took the lead. After the Red House, Geheimniss came to the front and maintained the lead as the field moved into the stretch. Dutch Oven came from the outside to beat Geheimniss by one and a half lengths, Shotover following four lengths behind. It was the first and last time in St. Leger history that fillies took the first, second and third positions in the race. Her win was met with \\"dead silence\\" from the spectators. Dutch Oven continued her streak with wins in the Great Foal Stakes and the Triennial Produce Stakes at the Newmarket October meeting. She was third to Tristan in the Champion Stakes and to Shrewsbury in the Newmarket Derby. She won ¬£7752 over the season. =1883:four-year-old season= Returning as a four-year-old in April at the Craven meeting, Dutch Oven walked over for the Newmarket Biennial Stakes. Over the course of the season, Dutch Oven was repeatedly out classed by Tristan, finishing second by three lengths in the running for the 2.5-mile Ascot Gold Cup and unplaced in the Hardwicke Stakes a few days later. She won the Her Majesty's Plate at Four Oaks Park and was third in the Goodwood Cup to Border Minstrel. At Newmarket in October, she won the Triennial Stakes but was again third to Tristan and Ossian in the Champion Stakes. At Houghton, in what was her final career engagement, Dutch Oven was fourth and last in the Jockey Club Cup won by Ladislas. She won ¬£1210 over the season. Breeding career Dutch Oven was sold to Lord Fitzwilliam for ¬£3200 at the dispersal of Lord Falmouth's stud in the spring of 1884. She died in March 1894 after producing the colt Simmer to the cover of St. Simon. At the time of her death, she was considered a failure as a broodmare as her produce were not good racers. Her sons Spring Jack, Gridiron and Simmer did achieve success in the stud in Argentina and Australia.

Dutch Oven died shortly after Simmer's birth and he was raised by a foster mare. Simmer was unraced due to a leg injury as a yearling. Derided as a horse that could \\"neither gallop, trot nor walk\\", he was exported to Australia in 1898 to the Tocal Stud for use as a breeding stallion. He was sold at the dispersal of the stud in 1901 to George Kiss for ¬£1200. He died in May 1909 at the Hobartville stud in New South Wales. Simmer sired the AJC St. Leger winner Dividend, and he appears in the pedigrees of Australian steeplechase horses, such as Hercules and Kincumber.

He co-founded the F√ºrstliche freie Zeichenschule Weimar with the painter Georg Melchior Kraus in 1776. He was the father of the writer and journalist Karl Bertuch.  Life Early life= Bertuch came from a family attested in the Tennstedt area of Thuringia since the 15th century. His family was also strongly connected with the area's scientific and intellectual fields (e.g. Justin Bertuch 1654‚Äì1726, director of the F√ºrstenschule Schulpforta at Naumburg 1701‚Äì16). When Friedrich Johann Justin Bertuch was 5, his father Justinus became garrison doctor in the service of duke Ernst August Konstantin at Blutsturz. He lost his mother aged 15 and grew up in the house of his uncle Gottfried Matthias Ludwig Schr√∂n (a member of the Weimarer Rat der Landschaftskasse). He attended the Weimar Gymnasium, studied from 1765 to 1769 theology then law at the Landesuniversit√§t in Jena. His main interest, however, was for literature and natural history. His acquaintance with Freiherr Ludwig Heinrich Bachoff von Echt allowed the 22-year-old Bertuch to break off his studies without taking his final exams, and that same year he began work as tutor to Ludwig's son at the Gut Dobitschen at Altenburg, holding the post until 1773. From him he learned Spanish (Bachoff von Echt was envoy to Spain), translating Don Quixote into German and self-publishing it in 1774. His translations from English and French literature also promised success. =Weimar= In 1773 he returned to Weimar for health reasons, though he maintained contacts with the court kapellmeister Ernst Wilhelm Wolf and his wife, the daughter of the famous Konzertmeister Franz Benda, as well as with the acting couple Friederike and Abel Seyler, the actor Konrad Ekhof and the professor at the gymnasium Johann Karl August Mus√§us. He funded his living expenses until 1796 as manager of the ducal private finances. Christoph Martin Wieland, tutor at the Weimar court and publisher of the \\"Teutschen Merkur\\", cooperated with Bertuch from 1782 to 1786 and provided him with his way into the Weimar court. His translation of the tragedy \\"Ines de Castro\\" given before duchess Anna Amalia from the French of Antoine Houdar de la Motte received much attention. In 1774 he submitted the plan for a Zeichenschule in Weimar, which was finally set up drawing on his ideas by Johann Heinrich Meyer and from 1788 Goethe. Bertuch's goal was that any interested persons, whatever their social standing, might have the chance to gain technical crafts skills and training for their talents. =From 1775= In 1775 he became private secretary to the duke and held that role until 1787, during which time he participated in the Weimar Masonic lodge Amalia zu den drei Rosen. He also had many business activities. In 1777 he gained a hereditary lease on the gro√üen Baumgarten in Erbpacht, a Grundst√ºck, now known as the Schwansee-Park. In 1782 he founded a factory for artificial flowers, an artistic and commercial fashion item, with which he had success right across Germany. In 1785 he set up the Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung (later the Neue Jena‚Äôsche Allgemeine Literaturzeitung). From 1778 he could change the works themselves, into a paper mill and pigment production, in another example of his vision and commercial talent. In 1780 he leased his house to the Weimarer Baumgarten, and also moved his flower production there, where Goethe's later wife Christiane Vulpius was employed. The Journal des Luxus und der Moden, published by Bertuch from 1786, not only praised artificial flowers but also the technical innovations and reading matter on maintenance and instruction, and is considered as the first pictorial periodical in Europe. He planned a Landes-Industrie-Comptoirs, to promote regional industry, train skilled workers and increase the prosperity of the region, and was given a princely dispensation to set it up in 1791. He temporarily employed 400 to 500 people (around 10% of the Weimar population) and succeeded in combining printers, artists and cartographers under one roof. Pay there was also above average. In 1793 Bertuch himself defined this art business in a magazine as being \\"an infallible means of encouraging German industry and spreading food and prosperity among us\\". Here again practically applied Enlightenment ideas pointed to a kind of free market economy Bertuch was just such a private citizen who attained national and European influence above and beyond \\"local usefulness and effectiveness\\". Within the Cartoir and the paper and colour mill he set up a cartographical department (which became in 1804 the Geographisches Institut and continued to grow). With his instruments of printing for the \\"literary and artistic industry\\", Bertuch held himself to be a \\"literary midwife\\". He underwrote Goethe's first publication with G√∂schen, and his \\"Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung\\" increased in circulation and receipts. Between 1790 and 1830 Betruch printed the Bilderbuch f√ºr Kinder appeared in 12 volumes. An educational work, it appeared in monthly instalments and aimed to \\"spread the knowledge of the epochs out before children\\" with 1185 pages and 6000 illustrations.

From 1814 Bertuch functioned as (among other things) a publisher of political newspapers and pamphlets such as Nemesis and Das Oppositionsblatt.

Members of this family have a widespread distribution in tropical and temperate areas. Taxonomy The type genus of the Inocybaceae, Inocybe, had traditionally been placed within the family Cortinariaceae. Despite this, J√ºlich placed the genus in its own family, the Inocybaceae.J√ºlich W. (1982). Higher taxa of Basidiomycetes. Bibliotheca Mycologia 85. Cramer, Vaduz. 485 pp. Later, the Cortinariaceae were shown to be polyphyletic. Additionally, phylogenetic analyses of RPB1, RPB2 and nLSU-rDNA regions from a variety of Inocybe and related taxa would support J√ºlich's recognition of Inocybe at the family level. In their Dictionary of the Fungi, Kirk et al. (2008) did not distinguish between Inocybaceae and Crepidotaceae, but rather merged them into one family they called Inocybaceae. The literature has since then split up the classification given by Kirk et al. (2008) into not only Inocybaceae and Crepidotaceae, but also Tubariaceae and Chromocyphellaceae.

He holds the title of the US Olympic competitor who has competed in the greatest number of Olympics, winning two team gold medals, three team silvers and one individual silver. He has also competed at the World Equestrian Games and Pan-American Games, winning medals at both, as well as competing in the Rolex Kentucky Three Day and steeplechase events. He has been named to the Hall of Fame of the United States Eventing Association (USEA), as well as winning annual USEA awards, and is the only equestrian rider to have been inducted to the United States Olympic Hall of Fame. He was previously married to fellow Olympian Donnan Plumb, and the couple has three sons. Personal life Plumb was born in Islip, New York, and grew up in Syosset, New York. His father, Charles, was a steeplechase rider and huntsman, and his mother, Meem, was also an equestrian. Plumb began riding at the Meadow Brooks Hounds Pony Club, where he participated in Pony Club. In 1972, he graduated from the University of Delaware. He married Donnan Sharp Plumb, a dressage rider who competed in the 1968 Summer Olympics; they later divorced. The couple had three sons ‚Äì Hugh, Matt and Charlie; Charlie became a successful event rider. Matt and Hugh have had a successful auto racing career in sports car racing. CareerCompetition= Plumb began his international competitive three-day event career at the 1959 Pan American Games in Chicago, Illinois. Throughout his career he competed for the United States in several other Pan-American Games, and won three gold medals, including an individual gold in 1963 and team golds in 1963 and 1967. Plumb also competed at several Eventing World Championships, accruing four medals. In 1974 he assisted the US team to a silver, while also taking silver in the individual competition, and helped the US team to bronze medals in both 1978 and 1982. As of 2008, Plumb was the US Olympic athlete with the greatest number of appearances in any sport at the Games. He was named to the US team in every Olympic games between 1960 (his first) and 1984, as well as appearing for the last time at the 1992 Summer Olympics, and competed at all of the Games except for 1980, when the US did not compete. During his seven Olympic appearances, he gathered multiple medals. At the 1960 Summer Olympics, Plumb took an individual 15th, while the US team did not finish the competition. At the 1964 Games, he repeated his individual performance, while the US team improved to take the silver medal. At these Games, he became the first rider ever to win a medal on a horse that he had never previously ridden in competition. Plumb had planned to ride his main event horse, Markham, but on the flight to the Games in Tokyo, the horse panicked, possibly due to a bad experience previously suffered in a horse trailer. In order to keep him from destroying his stall and potentially the aircraft, the horse was euthanized.Bryant, pp. 56‚Äì57 Plumb instead rode Bold Minstrel, a horse loaned to him by another top-level eventer. In 1968, at Ciudad de Mexico, Plumb took an individual 14th, while the US team again finished with a silver. In 1970, when Jack le Goff became coach of the United States eventing team, Plumb was one of only three active US riders with international experience in the sport. Between then and 1984, when le Goff retired, the US eventing team, with Plumb as part, amassed three team and three individual medals, as well as additional triumphs at the World Equestrian Games and Pan-American Games.Bryant, pp. 116‚Äì118 At the 1972 Summer Olympics, the US team took the silver medal for the third Games in a row, while Plumb finished 20th individually. At the 1976 Games, Plumb achieved his only individual medal, taking silver, while the US team took gold. Plumb qualified for the 1980 U.S. Olympic team but did not compete due to the U.S. Olympic Committee's boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Russia. He was one of 461 athletes to receive a Congressional Gold Medal instead. Despite the US boycott, Plumb competed at the alternate games in Fontainebleau, France. The team repeated this performance at the 1984 Olympics, while Plumb took an individual 10th place. In 1988, he was slated to make the US Equestrian Team, but was not able to compete due to a fall that resulted in a broken collarbone. In 1992, Plumb competed in his last Olympics, placing 48th individually while the team took 10th. Plumb has ridden in steeplechase competitions, and in 1976 placed second at the Maryland Hunt Cup, an event which his father had won in 1929. He has also competed multiple times at the Rolex Kentucky Three Day. =Influence= In 2002, Plumb was named as one of the 50 most influential horsemen of the 20th century by the equine magazine Chronicle of the Horse. In 2003, Plumb was inducted to the United States Eventing Association Hall of Fame, along with one of his horses, Plain Sailing. Good Mixture, another of Plumb's horses, was inducted in 2009. In 2008, Plumb became the first (and to date, only) equestrian to be inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame. The United States Eventing Association awarded Plumb their Leading Rider of the Year Award on ten occasions. Plumb is known for his training abilities with both horses and other riders, and as of 2018 he continued to ride and train at his stables in Southern Pines, North Carolina. Plumb is reticent about discussing his accomplishments, but colleagues have referred to him as the \\"ultimate team member\\" who could be counted on to be at the top of his game and a consistent performer. As team captain at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, he was noted for helping his teammates understand everything that was going on around them. His athleticism and personal courage have been praised by those who know him, such as Michael Page, chef d‚Äôequipe for the 1986 US World Championship team, who recounted how Plumb medaled at the competition despite three broken ribs. Plumb admits to being completely focused on riding and \\"not a social person\\", with former coach Jack le Goff saying that \\"horses are his only reason for being on earth\\".

Zenith bought the rights to solar technology from Ben-Gurion University and Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE to create solar energy using mirrors and lenses that magnify and focus the sun's rays. In testing, the concentrated solar technology proved to be up to five times more efficient than standard flat photovoltaic silicon panels, which would make it almost as cheap as oil and natural gas. A prototype ready for commercialization achieved a concentration of solar energy that was more than 1,000 times greater than standard flat panels. According to Faiman, who led the Israeli team that developed the technology, 10% of Israel‚Äôs energy needs (1,000 megawatts) could be met from 12 square kilometres of land.Zenith Solar‚Äôs Light of a Thousand Suns, Green Prophet, December 17, 2007 Zenith Solar was assembling solar panel kits at its factory in Kiryat Gat.Born-again Ziontist revolutionizing solar energy field, Haaretz The company used CHP (combined heat and power) technology which it claimed reached efficiencies of over 70%.

Such shrines were historically commonly found throughout the former territory of Wuyue. Qian (; Shanghainese: ), also spelt Chin, Chien, Tsien, or Zee in Wu Chinese, is a common Chinese family name. The name literally means \\"money\\". Qian is listed at the second place in the Song Dynasty text Hundred Family Surnames, in the line Ë∂ôÈå¢Â≠´Êùé (Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li). As the royal surname of the kingdom of Wuyue, Qian was regarded as second only to Zhao, the imperial surname of the Song. As of 2008, Qian is the 96th most common surname in China, shared by 2.2 million people, with the province with the most people sharing the name being Jiangsu, an area formerly within the Wuyue kingdom. Origins According to the Song dynasty book, Tongzhi, the Qian surname is descended from Zhuanxu, one of the legendary Five Emperors, via Pengzu, the founder of the Peng kingdom in modern-day Jiangsu during the Shang dynasty. A Zhou dynasty official, Fu, was a descendant of Pengzu and served in the royal Treasury, the Qianfu (\\"Money Office\\"). His descendants adopted the surname \\"Qian\\", literally \\"money\\", from his title. Being descendants of the Peng kingdom, the Qian family originally congregated around Xiapi, in modern-day Jiangsu. The surname spread from there, now has its highest concentration of it in the Jiangnan region. During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907-960), Qian Liu and his descendants ruled the independent kingdom of Wuyue in south-eastern China. Qian Liu had many sons, who were posted to different parts of his kingdom, greatly increasing the density of the Qian surname within the former territory of Wuyue. This area comprises today's Zhejiang, Shanghai, southern Jiangsu and northern Fujian. After Wuyue submitted to the Song Dynasty in 978, the last king moved to Bianjing, the Song capital in modern-day Henan. The Qian family was thereafter prominent at the Song court, with Qian Chu's son, Qian Weiyan, serving as a prominent Chancellor. During this period, the Qian family also spread to northern China.

This is sometimes called a reverse dictionary because it organized by concepts, phrases, or the definitions rather than headwords. This is similar to a thesaurus, where one can look up a concept by some common, general word, and then find a list of near-synonyms of that word. (For example, in a thesaurus one could look up \\"doctor\\" and be presented with such words as healer, physician, surgeon, M.D., medical man, medicine man, academician, professor, scholar, sage, master, expert.) In theory, a reverse dictionary might go further than this, allowing you to find a word by its definition only (for example, to find the word \\"doctor\\" knowing only that he is a \\"person who cures disease\\"). Such dictionaries have become more practical with the advent of computerized information-storage and retrieval systems (i.e. computer databases). An example of this type of reverse dictionary is the Diccionario Ideol√≥gico de la Lengua Espa√±ola (Spanish Language Ideological Dictionary).

This is a major part of the process that converts ordinary lipids into chemical signals like anandamide and oleoylethanolamine. In humans, the NAPE-PLD protein is encoded by the NAPEPLD gene.See for in-depth coverage.  Discovery  NAPE-PLD is an enzyme activity - a phospholipase, acting on phospholipids found in the cell membrane. It is not homology but the chemical outcome of its activity that classes it as phospholipase D. The enzymatic activity was discovered and characterized in a series of experiments culminating in the 2004 publication of a biochemical purification scheme from which peptide sequencing could be accomplished. Researchers homogenized (finely ground) hearts from 150 rats and subjected the resulting crude lysate to sucrose sedimentation at 105,000 x g to separate out the cell membranes from the remainder of the cell. The integral membrane proteins were then solubilized using octyl glucoside and subjected to four column chromatography steps (HiTrap SP HP cation-exchange column, HiTrap Q anion-exchange column, HiTrap Blue affinity column, Bio-Gel HTP hydroxyapatite column). Each of these separates the different types of membrane proteins into different sample containers when the proteins are eluted from the column over time, and by measuring the activity of samples in each container it was possible to track which ones received the active enzyme. Measurement of the enzyme activity was done by thin layer chromatography of a radioactive substrate sensitive to the NAPE-PLD enzymatic activity: Cleavage of the substrate affected where it appeared on the plate when the radiation was detected on a bioimaging analyzer. The result of this extensive procedure was still not a pure protein, but it produced a limited number of bands by SDS- PAGE, and one band of 46 kilodaltons was found to correlate in intensity with the enzymatic activity. This band was cut out from the gel and digested with trypsin, and peptides from it were separated from one another by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The resulting fragments were then microsequenced by an automated Edman degradation. Three corresponded to vimentin, an intermediate filament protein of 56 kDa believed to be a contaminant, and the other two matched the cDNA clone subsequently identified as NAPE-PLD. Once this clue had been obtained, the identification could be confirmed by a less onerous procedure: Overexpression of the putative NAPE-PLD cDNA in COS-7 cells yielded a strong NAPE-PLD enzymatic activity, whose characteristics were shown to be similar to those of the original heart extract.  Characteristics  The NAPEPLD cDNA sequence predicts 396 amino acid sequences in both mice and rats, which are 89% and 90% identical to that of humans. NAPE-PLD was found to have no homology to the known phospholipase D genes, but can be classed by homology to fall into the zinc metallohydrolase family of the beta-lactamase fold. In particular, the highly conserved motif HX(E/H)XD(C/R/S/H)X50‚Äì70HX15‚Äì30(C/S/D)X30‚Äì70H was observed, which is, in general, associated with zinc binding and hydrolysis reaction in this class of proteins, leading the authors to propose that activity should be correlated with zinc content. When recombinant NAPE-PLD was tested in COS cells in vitro it had similar activity toward several radiolabeled substrates: N-palmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine, N-arachidonoylphosphatidylethanolamine, N-oleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, and N-stearoylphosphatidylethanolamine all reacted with a Km between 2‚Äì4 micromolar and a Vmax between 73 and 101 nanomole per milligram per minute as calculated by Lineweaver‚ÄìBurk plot. (These generate N-palmitoylethanolamine, anandamide, N-oleoylethanolamine, and N-stearoylethanolamine, respectively) The enzyme also reacted N-palmitoyl- lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine and N-arachidonoyl-lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine with similar Km but at one-third to one-fourth the Vmax. These activities are consistent with the observation that many tissues produce a range of N-acylethanolamines. However, NAPE-PLD had no ability to produce detectable phosphatidic acid from phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine as is catalyzed by other phospholipase D enzymes. It also lacks the transphosphatidylation activity of phospholipase D that allows the creation of phosphatidyl alcohols rather than phosphatidic acid in the presence of ethanol or butanol.  Pathway  This enzyme acts as the second step of a biochemical pathway initiated by the creation of N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine, by means of the transfer of an acyl group from the sn-1 position of glycerophospholipid onto the amino group of phosphatidylethanolamine. While NAPE-PLD contributes to the biosynthesis of several NAEs in the mammalian central nervous system, it is not clear if this enzyme is not responsible for the formation of the endocannabinoid anandamide, since NAPE-PLD knockout mice have been reported to have wild-type levels or very reduced levels of anandamide. The N-acylethanolamines released by this enzyme become potential substrates for fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which hydrolyzes the free fatty acids from ethanolamine. Defects in this enzyme can cause NAPE-PLD products such as anandamide to build up to levels 15-fold higher than normally observed.  Structure  This membrane enzyme forms homodimers, partly separated by an internal ‚àº9-√Ö-wide channel. The metallo beta-lactamase protein fold is adapted to associate with membrane phospholipids. A hydrophobic cavity provides an entry way for the substrate NAPE into the active site, where a binuclear zinc center catalyzes its hydrolysis. Bile acids bind with high affinity to selective pockets in this cavity, enhancing dimer assembly and enabling catalysis. NAPE-PLD facilitates crosstalk between bile acid signals and lipid amide signals.

As Boylston Professor of Rhetoric at Harvard University from 1876 to 1904, Hill oversaw and implemented curriculum that came to effect first-year composition in classrooms across the United States. His most widely known works include The Principles of Rhetoric, Foundations of Rhetoric, and Our English. Life and career Hill was born in Boston, Massachusetts. After the death of his father in 1838 and his mother in 1846, Hill was raised by his uncle, Alonzo Hill. His uncle encouraged Hill to become a minister, but he chose instead to attend Harvard, graduating with a law degree in 1855. After working as a law reporter and night editor for the New York Tribune until 1872, he returned to Harvard to become an assistant professor of rhetoric.Bizzell and Herzberg, 1143 In 1876, he was promoted to Boylston Professor of Rhetoric, a position he held until 1904. Reconstruction-Era education and culture Hill's tenure as Boylston Professor coincided with a widely growing cultural desire for education in Reconstruction-Era America. The number of colleges in America, particularly small, religious colleges, rose rapidly after 1865, and universities across the country saw their student populations increase in turn.Paine, \\"The Composition Course\\", 286 As the industrial revolution began to move more and more people to cities, many individuals saw college as an opportunity to make themselves marketable for jobs. This influx of students, coupled with the expanded number of composition programs across the country, meant that more and more teachers were brought in from secondary schools to teach these newly created composition classes. Overworked, teaching students who frequently needed more help with their compositions, (because they were generally not as classically educated as the ‚Äúelite‚Äù students colleges had traditionally been set up to teach) composition instructors began to seek help in the form of textbooks. This cultural expansion, along with newly improved printing presses, helped give rise to the expanded usage of textbooks in American composition classrooms. At the same time, the use of newspapers became more widespread.Paine, \\"The Resistant Writer\\", 107 With the mass influx of newspapers meant more journalists, many who lacked college education, and in fact thought it unhelpful to their careers.Paine, \\"The Resistant Writer\\", 109 This highly consumed, but less educated style of writing clashed, however, with that of nineteenth-century intellectuals, who considered criticism vital to defining and upholding the standards of taste. Because persons not considered \\"elite\\" had access to a large body of readers, intellectuals' authority, and thus importance, was deteriorating in American culture.Paine, \\"The Resistant Writer\\", 120 Hill's views on culture sided him with the intellectuals of his time. As early as 1856, Hill vocalized about the dangers of \\"uneducated\\" newspaper journalists,Paine, \\"The Resistant Writer\\", 94 bemoaning the lack of control he as an \\"educated\\" man, was able to exert over the minds of his readers. By 1876, when Hill assumed the Boylston Professorship, it had already become cliche that the newspaper had replaced the rostrum and the pulpit. During his time at Harvard, Hill saw the university as the place to educate individuals of the moral and linguistic dangers of journalism.Paine \\"The Resistant Writer\\" 134 Rhetorical theory Much of Hill's writing focuses on rhetoric as a set of principles behind the skills of writing. It always wasn't enough to be lectured, Hill required his students to practice their writing. Hill's work was also heavily focused on grammar usage. Hill's theories are deeply rooted in Current Traditionalist rhetoric, which at its heart involves a pedagogical focus on finding and correcting mechanical errors in writing. Hill's theories also center on creating an American identity around a \\"properly used\\" English language, one that rejected \\"classical\\" standards of taste, and focused instead around a current understanding of English.Bizzell and Herzberg, 1143 The Principles of Rhetoric In probably his most influential work,Berlin, 67 Hill argues for a focus on rhetoric as an art, not a science. Therefore, The Principles of Rhetoric is only concerned with two elements: grammar and style. The text ignores Invention, and like many current traditional textbooks, places a heavy focus on exposition, which, according to the current-traditionalists, sets up the rational and empirical evidence in order to appeal to reason and understanding.Berlin, 66 Hill's Principles follows this definition fairly strictly. He sees rhetoric as style, not substance; it doesn't offer any new meaning or understanding. Therefore, what one needs to understand is how to use rhetoric to create more intellectual arguments, not to generate new knowledge. Much of the early focus in The Principles of Rhetoric is devoted primarily to Grammatical Purity. Hill offers many examples and rules on proper usage, including the three main ideas that language must be: reputable, national, and present.Bizzell and Herzberg, 1143 Figurative language is considered inferior to exposition. Hill also discusses the modes of writing in The Principles of Rhetoric, choosing to focus extensively on narration, description, and argumentation. Hill believed that movement and method in narration are ‚Äúthe life and logic of discourse‚Äù, a view that his journalist background may have helped develop. Description brings \\"before the mind of the reader persons or things as they appear to the writer\\".Hill, 248 Argument and persuasion, for Hill, are closely linked, with persuasion acting as \\"an adjunct\\" to argument; its main emphasis on feelings, not intellect.Berlin 67 Cultural impact The substantial impact that The Principles of Rhetoric had was largely aided by Hill's position at Harvard, which, from 1875 to 1900, was the most influential English program in the United States. Harvard‚Äôs university model was copied across the country, and Hill's words carried a lot of weight because he was the head of the Department of English. As a result, The Principles of Rhetoric remained in print from 1878 to 1923,Connors, 187 and current traditionalism was largely influential in English classrooms until the 1960s.Berlin, 75 Selected works Beginnings of Rhetoric and Composition: Including Practical Exercises in English, New York: American Book Company, 1902.

Gordon Melton, Encyclopedia of American Religions (Detroit: Gale, ) p. 540. History The Church of Israel was first organized in 1972. Dan Gayman had deposed the leaders of the Church of Christ at Zion's Retreat and was then elected leader of that church. Most of the members of the church followed Gayman. However, the deposed leaders of the Zion's Retreat church sued Gayman, and the courts ordered that the church property and name be returned to the deposed leaders, and that the members of Gayman's congregation be barred from the premises. Gayman informally organized his congregation under the name \\"the Church of Our Christian Heritage\\". In 1977, Gayman and 10 other individuals were arrested for trespassing when they led a group back to the Church of Christ at Zion's Retreat in an attempted forcible takeover. In 1981, Gayman incorporated his church under the name Church of Israel. Little of the Latter Day Saint movement background of the church remains in its current teachings and practices, although the influence and beliefs of the Fettingite seem to be apparent in the rural and isolationist (\\"survivalist\\") settings for the church's headquarters and are practiced by many of its adherents. (\\"Message 18\\" in the Fettingite corpora urges believers to \\"go to the land\\" in order to \\"flee destruction\\" in or of, American cities.)

The Anti-Defamation League includes the Church of Israel in its list of \\"extremist groups.\\" The ADL report states that members of the church are said to have been involved at times with controversial figures such as Bo Gritz, Eric Rudolph, and Thomas Robb, a national leader of the Ku Klux Klan. =2003 Rudolph connection= In 2003, it was revealed that the Olympic Park bomber and one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, Eric Rudolph, and his mother had attended the Church of Israel in 1984 for three or four months, when Eric was 18.Laura Parker, Richard Willing and Larry Copeland, \\"Rudolph was not the suspect FBI expected\\", USA Today, 2003-06-05. Gayman assumed a fatherly relationship with Rudolph and planned to groom Eric as a potential son-in-law by encouraging Eric to date his daughter. = 2003 lawsuit = After a falling-out between Gayman and two other leaders of the church in 2003, Gayman filed a lawsuit in an attempt to revoke a severance agreement that included the deed to a house and property that had been given to a former minister, Scott Stinson. Ultimately the judge sided with Stinson. =Publications= The church issues a quarterly newsletter called The Watchman. Beliefs Serpent seed doctrine = Gayman is famous for propagating the theology known as \\"two-seedline\\", or \\"serpent seed\\" doctrine. This doctrine holds that white people are descendants of Adam and are hence the chosen people of God. The Jewish people are said to be descendants of Cain and thus of Satan. This belief was developed by Wesley A. Swift, Conrad Gaard, Dan Gayman, and William Potter Gale, among others. =Political views= The Church of Israel holds a \\"deep distrust for the government\\". At one time, the church did not believe in the use of Social Security numbers, driver's licenses, or marriage licenses. Most children in the church who were home- birthed do not have Social Security numbers. =Medicine= The Church of Israel believes that the medical profession is \\"Jewish\\" and discourages the use of doctors and immunizations.

It was founded by recording artist and producer Blake Morgan in 2002 as record label Engine Company Records. Re-branded as ECR Music Group in late 2012, it now includes a roster of both labels and artists. The label differs from its counterparts in its artist-friendly philosophy and partnership wherein all ECR artists and labels own 100% of their master recordings. Artists on ECR Music Group have included Janita, James McCartney, Bari Leigh, Terry Manning, Blake Morgan, Lesley Gore, David Cloyd, Melissa Giges, indie band Shimmerplanet, Mike Errico, and many others. Morgan produces the releases, and genres vary significantly. Despite releasing only a few albums a year, in 2005 the label landed five albums in the Top 20 simultaneously, including Lesley Gore's Ever Since and Rick Henrickson's Reaching For A Gun. The label continues to be active, and recently released Didn't You, My Dear? by Brooklyn-based singer- songwriter Janita, Just When I Let Go by Melissa Giges and Diamonds In The Dark by Blake Morgan. ECR Music Group is distributed by Burnside Distribution. As of 2015, labels include Cabin Music, Dylanna Music, Engine Company Records, Hook & Ladder Records, Lucky Seven Records, and Starfish Music.  History  Engine Company Records logo from 2011 ECR Music Group was founded as Engine Company Records in 2002 by singer-songwriter, producer, and activist Blake Morgan. In 1996 Morgan had signed a seven-record deal with Phil Ramone's N2K Sony/Red label. However, he quickly became frustrated being on a corporate label. After his first tour he found a loophole in the contract. Despite being the label's most successful artist at the time, he told Ramone he wanted out of the deal. Morgan then began going to bands and artists he was recording at the time, and pitched an independent label where they would have control over their own material and output. He officially launched Engine Company Records in Manhattan, New York City in 2002, and remains CEO and owner. ECR Music Group announced the official launch date of its rebranding as October 4, 2012. The company now consists of an interconnected set of businesses and distinct resources, each aimed at helping its artists realize long-term creative and commercial success. Uniquely, ECR Music Group achieves these goals while operating under an elemental principle, unprecedented in the music world: All of its artists and labels own 100% of their master recordings. Similar to Rick Rubin's relationship with American Recordings, Morgan produces most of the music for the label. Genres have ranged from emo/punk, to alternative rock, to country, to classical. Recordings have taken place in locations such as The Hit Factory in New York and Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas. Among artists and producers that have worked with the label are James McCartney, Lesley Gore, Janita, David Cloyd, Mike Errico, Patti Rothberg, David Kahne, and Phil \\"Butcher Bros.\\" Nicolo, and Terry Manning. In a Sonicscoop interview Morgan singles out Terry Manning and Phil Nicolo as mentors. Morgan says: ‚ÄúOne of the great things I‚Äôve had in my career, that a lot of people have less and less of, is incredible mentors, who are giants in the recording world. Terry Manning and Phil Nicolo, these two guys have been incredible Obi-Wan Kenobis' for me.\\" Born from humble beginnings in a one-room makeshift recording studio and office, and launched on Morgan‚Äôs laptop computer, ECR Music Group has flourished and grown over the years to become a globally distributed family of artists and labels. As of 2015, its sub-labels include Cabin Music, Dylanna Music, Engine Company Records, Hook & Ladder Records, Lucky Seven Records, and Starfish Music. =Notable releases= In the first year of its existence, the label released four albums by artists such as indie band Shimmerplanet and professional musician Mike Errico. In summer of 2005 the label landed five albums in the Top 20 simultaneously, including Lesley Gore's Ever Since and Rick Henrickson's Reaching For A Gun. Gore's first album of new material since the 1970s, Ever Since was recorded with Morgan. The album received extensive national radio coverage and acclaim from The New York Times, Rolling Stone, and Billboard Magazine. Several songs from Ever Since have been used in television shows and films, and the track \\"Words We Don't Say\\" was featured in an episode of The L Word. Morgan's solo album Burning Daylight was released on the label on July 12, 2005. Co-produced with Grammy Award-winner Phil \\"Butcher Bros.\\" Nicolo, it reached #1 on eMusic's album charts. The bonus track of his cover of Paul McCartney's \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" became the most successful track in the history of the label, and climbed high on iTunes charts. The Lesley Gore rendition of his song \\"Better Angels\\" was featured in the 2005 season premiere of CSI: Miami. In 2006 his song \\"It's Gone,\\" also performed by Gore, was featured in the final scene and closing credits of the independent film Flannel Pajamas. The film was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. On March 18, 2009, Morgan's track \\"Better Angels\\" was featured in MTV's The Real World: Brooklyn. In June 2008, the label released 20th Century Duos for Violin and Cello with works by Zolt√°n Kod√°ly, Roger Sessions and Maurice Ravel, which received a glowing review for performance and engineering in The New York Times. Two years later, following releases by David Cloyd, Melissa Giges, and Morgenstern & Adkins, singer-songwriter Janita released her solo LP Haunted on the label. Singer-songwriter and producer David Cloyd signed to the label in 2008, and released his debut LP Unhand Me, You Fiend! in 2009. The album peaked at #1 on eMusic's Album Charts, and according to a review, \\"took the indie rock scene by storm.\\" His second album, I Could Disappear, included solo versions of his debut album, with Cloyd on vocals, piano, and guitar. He released a cover of Paul McCartney's 1971 song \\"Dear Boy\\" in September 2011. As of 2013, he is Executive Vice President of Creative Operations at ECR Music Group. Available Light, James McCartney's first official release as both a performer and songwriter, was released electronically by the label in 2010. It was produced by David Kahne and Paul McCartney, and received positive reviews. The label released his second EP, Close At Hand, in 2011. The Complete EP Collection, which combines the previous two EPs along with five new original tracks and two new covers, was released in late 2011. In late 2012 Engine Company Records was re-launched and rebranded as ECR Music Group, with the label itself remaining an imprint of the now larger umbrella company. The company's first release since rebranding was Blake Morgan's own most recent album, Diamonds In The Dark, (in 2013), which garnered numerous rave reviews. It was described in the press as ‚Äú‚Ä¶one of the finest albums of 2013. A must have.\\" and \\"a killer piece of art .\\" In 2014, Morgan's album was followed by singer-songwriter and pianist Melissa Giges' Just When I Let Go. With placements in multiple Kardashian shows, and MTV‚Äôs Real World, Giges has been heard by millions of TV fans. ECR's most recent release as of July 2015, is singer-songwriter Janita's new album Didn't You, My Dear?, which has been touted as her breakthrough record, drawing comparisons to Blonde Redhead and Patti Smith among others.

After releasing the alternative rock solo album Anger's Candy (1997) on Phil Ramone's N2K Sony/Red label, he began producing music independently and founded the label Engine Company Records in 2002, which in 2012 became ECR Music Group. He helps produce all music released by the label, which has included artists such as James McCartney, Janita, Mike Errico, Patti Rothberg, Lesley Gore, David Cloyd and Melissa Giges. His albums Anger's Candy, Burning Daylight, Silencer, and Diamonds in the Dark were positively received. Early life Morgan was born and raised in Manhattan. He is the son of American feminist activist and writer Robin Morgan and poet Kenneth Pitchford. He began playing the piano and going to music school at age five, with the aim of becoming a professional pianist. At age six his interest began to switch from classical composers such as Mozart and Bart√≥k to The Beatles, after his mother introduced him to Meet The Beatles. In first grade he began attending the United Nations International School in New York City. He stayed there for 12 years, and graduated with an International Baccalaureate. He concurrently continued his piano studies at Greenwich House Music School in Manhattan. Morgan's first gig was at CBGB's in New York, when older students from his school recruited him to play keyboards in their band. Since he was legally too young for the venue, they used his then short stature to smuggle him inside the club in a bass drum case. As the show began, Morgan came out of the case to jump on stage and play the synths. Music career After high school Morgan attended Berklee College of Music, where he completed a four-year program in three years and graduated magna cum laude. After college he began to play in various band formations and began pursuing music full-time, chiefly alternative rock. He has stated he has been influenced by musicians such as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Nirvana, Soundgarden, Radiohead, Bj√∂rk, Jeff Buckley, Death Cab, Neil Finn, Peter Gabriel, and The Police. In 1996 he released the EP Sneakers. =Anger's Candy (1997)= Blake Morgan in studio He signed a seven-record deal with Phil Ramone's N2K Sony/Red label in 1996, and released the solo album Anger's Candy later in 1997. The ten tracks included Lenny Kravitz performing backup vocals on \\"Why Don't You See.\\" The track \\"To Say It's Your Love\\" was co-written by Nandi Johannes. All other tracks were written by Morgan, and he performed vocals, acoustic and electric guitar, piano, and organ. Both Morgan and Terry Manning produced the album at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas. He toured the United States in support of the album for over a year, sharing stages with musicians such as Joan Jett. In response to the album, Billboard wrote \\"Morgan has a voice that was made to be heard on the radio . . . inspired songwriting and passionate performances.\\" The New York Times wrote \\"Blake Morgan's singing and performances are disarmingly unselfconscious.\\" Morgan has stated he quickly became frustrated with being on a corporate label. After the tour was completed he found a loophole in the contract, and despite being the label's most successful artist at the time, he told Ramone he wanted out of the deal. =Engine Company Records, ECR Music Group= While producing Anger's Candy, he had started helping other local artists and bands produce projects on the side. These on-going projects, as well as frustration with A&R; pitches from labels akin to N2K, led Morgan to consider creating his own independent label. He went to bands and artists he was recording at the time, and pitched a label where they would have control over their own material and output. He launched Engine Company Records in New York City in 2002, and remains CEO and owner. It was re-branded as ECR Music Group in late 2012, expanding into an umbrella company that includes Engine Company Records as well as a roster of other labels and artists. The associated publishing company is called Big Red Firetruck Music. Similar to Rick Rubin's relationship with American Recordings, Morgan produces the music for the label. Genres have ranged from emo/punk, to alternative rock, to Classical. He has recorded in locations such as The Hit Factory in New York and Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas. Among artists and producers that have worked with the label are James McCartney, Lesley Gore, Janita, Mike Errico, Patti Rothberg, Terry Manning, and Azam Ali. In summer of 2005 the label landed five albums in the Top 20 simultaneously, including Lesley Gore's Ever Since and Rick Henrickson's Reaching for a Gun. In June 2008, the label released 20th Century Duos for Violin and Cello with works by Zolt√°n Kod√°ly, Roger Sessions and Maurice Ravel, which received a glowing review for performance and engineering in The New York Times. =Burning Daylight (2005)= His next solo album, Burning Daylight, was released on Engine Company Records on July 12, 2005. Co-produced with Grammy Award-winner Phil Nicolo, it reached #1 on eMusic's album charts, holding the number spot for both album, single (\\"Danger to Wake You\\"), and artist at the same time. The bonus track of his cover of Paul McCartney's \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" became the most successful track in the history of the label, and climbed high on iTunes charts. The album received a positive review and 4/5 stars on Allmusic. The Washington Post wrote \\"He's got killer pop-rock instincts . . . a natural when it comes to fashioning sharp melodies and catchy choruses.\\" In 2006 his song \\"It's Gone,\\" performed by Lesley Gore, was featured in the final scene and closing credits of the independent film Flannel Pajamas, by Jeff Lipsky. The film, which was lauded by Roger Ebert, was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. On March 18, 2009, the track \\"Better Angels\\" from the album was featured in MTV's The Real World: Brooklyn. The Lesley Gore version of \\"Better Angels\\" was also featured in the 2005 season premiere of CSI: Miami. =Silencer (2006)= On October 25, 2006, he released the album Silencer' It features Morgan on vocals and piano performing acoustic versions of both new and older material, dating back to 1996. A cover of \\"No Surprises\\" by Radiohead was also released as a digital bonus track. The album again received a positive review on AllMusic, which gave it a 3/5 stars and said \\"These are darkly heartfelt, enigmatic and melodic songs that often bring to mind a mix of the yearning, expansive rock of the Smashing Pumpkins and the soulful AM pop of Todd Rundgren. Meditative and sanguine, these are afterglow torch songs for the alt rock set.\\" Blender wrote \\"Great songs and great singing is apparently all you need if you have the goods, and there are plenty of goods to be had here . . . with imaginative arrangements that underscore his raw, iconic singing.\\" As of 2009, he continues to produce and work on original material for upcoming albums. He is sponsored by Gibson Guitars. =Diamonds In The Dark (2013)= Silencer fueled the anticipation for Blake Morgan's most recent album, Diamonds In The Dark, which was released on July 30, 2013 on ECR Music Group. The album garnered numerous rave reviews, and was described in the press as ‚Äú‚Ä¶one of the finest albums of 2013. A must have.\\" and \\"a killer piece of art .\\" Morgan wrote the entire album, performing all the vocals, and the majority of the instruments, in addition to producing, recording, mixing and mastering it. In a Halfstack magazine interview he calls the title of the album symbolic, and explains that the songs are the diamonds that he had picked out of a difficult, dark period in his life. A unique aspect of the album is that the tracks are ordered almost identically to the order in which they were written. Diamonds in the Dark is a turning point for Morgan artistically,and the release of the album coincided with the beginning of Morgan's political activism on behalf of artists. Activism Morgan's political activism on behalf of artists began in May 2013, when a pointed email exchange between him and the founder of Pandora, Tim Westergren, regarding lowered royalties, was published in the Huffington Post. The article was met with much enthusiasm in the artist community, and Pandora lost $130 million in the stock market the following morning. This David vs. Goliath struggle for artists' rights ended in a whistle-blowing victory over the Internet radio giant, and led to the multibillion-dollar company abandoning its own signature legislation (IRFA = Internet Radio Fairness Act) in Washington. The legislation would have reduced artists' pay by up to 85%. In mid-December 2013, following the defeat of IRFA, Mr. Morgan went on to write an Op-ed for the Huffington Post titled 'Art and Music Are Professions Worth Fighting For', which further galvanized the musician community. The idea for the next step in his artist advocacy‚Äìthe campaign \\"I Respect Music\\"‚Äìwas born in this very piece, which went viral and became Huffington Post‚Äôs most-read music article of 2013. It closed with a simple message: ‚ÄúMy New Year‚Äôs resolution is to stand up more, and speak more. I respect my profession. I respect artists. I respect music.‚Äù A tweet from a young artist from the Philippines, named Joana Marie Lor, in response to Morgan's article, was the first to use the hashtag #IRespectMusic. This, in Morgan's words, was the ‚Äútweet that started it all.‚Äù He has also said: \\"Once the article went viral. . . it was clear that idea‚Äìand those three words‚Äìhad resonated far more deeply than anyone could have expected.\\" =#IRespectMusic - The campaign= Inspired by the over 40,000 \\"likes\\" that Blake Morgan received in December 2013 on his Huffington Post article, \\"Art and Music Are Professions Worth Fighting For,\\" Morgan decided the time was right to launch a petition to Congress, I Respect Music, supporting a musician's right to receive pay for radio airplay. To boot off the campaign, Morgan wrote the words \\"#I Respect Music\\" on an index card and showed it to the world in a self-made video, which was posted on the I Respect Music-website in anticipation of the action. The petition was launched a week later on January 28 of 2014, and it went viral at an unprecedented pace. Everyday working musicians, music fans, music organizations, and luminaries like Patrick Stewart, Gavin DeGraw, Gloria Steinem, Aerosmith's Joe Perry, Jane Fonda, Jean Michele Jarre, Marisa Tomei, Roseanne Cash, Mike Mills, John McCrea, Civil Twilight, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, and countless others voiced their support by both signing the petition, and posting or tweeting a \\"selfie\\" with the hashtag: #IRespectMusic. Within thirty days the petition had received nearly 10,000 signatures. The petition is based on the fact that the United States is the only democratic country in the world where artists don‚Äôt get paid for radio airplay, and that the short list of countries that share the United States‚Äô position on this issue includes Iran, North Korea, China, Vietnam, and Rwanda. As a result of not paying their artists for radio airplay in the United States, other democratic countries aren‚Äôt paying American artists in their countries. The petition seeks legislation that would get artists paid for the work that they do, in sync with the rest of the democratic world. =Fair Play Fair Pay Act of 2015= Morgan spent much of his time in 2014 and early 2015 in the offices of members of Congress, convincing them of the need for reform to protect musicians' rights. He came to see the fruit of his labors in April 2015 when Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) and Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL) introduced bipartisan legislation, titled the \\"Fair Play Fair Pay Act of 2015\\". This music bill would have ensured that all artists are fairly paid on digital and AM/FM radio. In an interview for BroadwayWorld.com Morgan had this to say about the proposed legislation: \\"This Act would fundamentally change the lives of millions of hard working American music makers. It would reverse our country's century-old position on not paying artists when their work is played on the radio. It would restore digital royalty payments to music makers whose iconic work was released prior to 1972 (protecting many legacy artists who are now in their seventies and eighties), work that is constantly monetized by billion dollar corporations without any recompense to the artists who created that work. It would get music producers paid too. It guarantees a tech-neutral approach. It guarantees songwriters won't be penalized in the fight to get the artists who perform those songs paid as well. There's even more good in the bill than all that, but suffice it to say, it is a historic and long overdue move to reform the musical landscape for millions of Americans, and I couldn't support it more strongly.\\" =NMPA Partners With The I Respect Music Campaign= On June 18, 2015 Billboard Magazine reported on The National Music Publishers Assn. new partnership with the I Respect Music campaign established to support passage of the Songwriters Equity Act, that was re-introduced to Congress earlier in 2015. The partnership was announced by NMPA CEO David Israelite, followed by a speech by Blake Morgan at the organization's annual meeting, held on June 17 of 2015 at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square. Says David Israelite: \\"To date, [I Respect Music] has mainly focused on artist and labels,\\" but songwriters could benefit from being aligned with the movement. Throughout 2014 and 2015 Morgan has spoken about the I Respect Music-campaign, the Fair Play Fair Pay Act, and other artists' rights issues on major media, from CNN and Fox News, to NPR and The New York Times.

Biography  Born in Osaka, Yoshie Kashiwabara took part in, and won, the \\"Star Tanjo\\" contest in 1979, and rose to fame in 1980 as a teen idol, making her debut with the song \\"No.1\\" when she was only 14 years old. With determination and strong will, plus a good voice, Yoshie finally made it with a top 10 song \\"Hello Goodbye\\" ‚Äì her 7th single ‚Äì in autumn 1981, bringing her instant fame and popularity. Yoshie's strong performance continued in 1982, with all four of her singles in that year making it into the top 10, and many were expecting her to be selected for the year-end NHK Red and White Song festival, but she was surprisingly dropped while Junko Mihara, who also debuted in 1980 along with Yoshie, was chosen, making it the headline news for that year's annual show. Yoshie continued to work hard the next year (1983) not only by singing; she acted in a few dramas as well, and as expected, she was finally rewarded by being selected for that year's Red and White Song Festival. In 1985, Yoshie tried to leave her teen idol image behind by portraying a more mature, sexier image, and was well recognised. Her sexy posters for her hit song \\"Quietly in love\\" („Åó„Éª„ÅÆ„Éª„Å≥„ÉªÊÑõ), which were hung on buildings and advertisement venues, were all stolen within days, and in this year it was found out that the then Crown Prince of Japan was a big fan of Yoshie, and instantly she was the talk of the town, pushing her to return to the stage of Kohaku (Red and White) for a second (and final) appearance. From 1986 onwards, Yoshie began writing lyrics for her own songs, but in the ever-competitive Japanese music industry, her popularity began to decline precipitously. She then began to focus on acting and releasing many photography album, mostly featuring her in swimsuits and/or sexy lingerie. She has released a total of 37 singles, but only and after 1990. Her last single was released in 2008, for which she wrote the lyrics. As of now, Yoshie still sings and held her annual gala dinner show. One of her biggest hits, \\"Haru na no ni\\", composed by Miyuki Nakajima, which was released in spring 1983, was a song about graduation, and is still one of the most popular graduation-themed songs which is performed all over Japan during graduation period. Other than producing 18 top-ten singles from 1981 to 1986 and performing twice (1983 and 1985) on the annual Kohaku, Yoshie's biggest achievement during her career was perhaps, despite being labelled as a pop idol, to be nominated for the best singing female artist for three consecutive years (1985‚Äì1987). In 2011, one of the most famous Japanese music programs, Music Station, held a special programme where they counted down the Top 50 Idols of All-Time (the list spanning over four decades) based on their sales total; Yoshie Kashiwabara was in the 40th position, with total sales of 4,400,000 copies. In 2017, Yoshie released her long-awaited new photography album named Yoshie MODE, one of the most expensive photography albums being sold, which was well received.  Personal life  Yoshie is single. She is very much into fine clay art work, cooking, movies, photography and scuba diving.

Biography Fryar was born on 25 January 1828 at Willington, Northumberland, England, the son of Thomas Fryar (mining engineer), and his wife Mary Ann, n√©e Scott. He immigrated to Queensland, Australia in 1853. At intervals between 1864 and 1882, Fryar worked in the Lands Department as a licensed surveyor in the south-eastern regions of Maroochy and Mooloolah. In 1869, Fryar went into partnership with James Strachan and established the first sugar mill on the river at Loganholme. This was initially a very successful business that employed up to 100 men at crushing time. However, they were declared insolvent in 1876, because of problems with the delivery of new equipment from Glasgow. Fryar returned to his occupation as a surveyor. On 18 November 1873, he joined the seventh Queensland parliament as the member for East Moreton in the Legislative Assembly where he was mainly interested in land policy. In May 1875, Fryar replaced Thomas Stephens who resigned as the Secretary for Lands in the third Arthur Macalister ministry, until its fall on 5 June 1876. He remained the member for East Moreton until he resigned in 1877, again returning to surveying. In 1882, Fryar became the first Queensland inspector of mines and held the senior post, the Southern Division, until he retired in June 1904. He had become one of the first directors of the Queensland Evangelical Standard, a Dissenting weekly of strong political character, established on 10 June 1875. In 1857 at Brisbane he had married Margaret Louisa Lewis. Of their ten children only two sons and two daughters survived him.

Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . The reactive involuting type, reactive angioendotheliomatosis is an uncommon cutaneous condition characterized histologically by a dense proliferation of small capillaries, and occurs in people with various diseases including subacute bacterial endocarditis and end-stage atherosclerotic disease. These people present with various skin lesions and rashes - most commonly on the thighs. Treatment aimed at the underlying condition hastens the resolution of the lesions. The malignant type is an intravascular lymphoma, usually of the diffuse B-cell type, known as intravascular large B-cell lymphoma. It progresses rapidly through involvement of multiple body systems and mortality occurs in less than a year from the initial diagnosis. The average age at diagnosis is 55 years. The causative mechanism is unknown. In a few cases treatment with palliative chemotherapy has been effective.

The other stations are Sealdah in Kolkata, Kolkata station in Kolkata, Howrah Station in Howrah and Santragachi in Howrah. Shalimar station is situated at Shalimar, in Shibpur area of Howrah. It is one of the cleanest, most well-maintained and non-congested railway terminals in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area. History The place where now the station is situated was formerly a very small rail station, and served by some diesel loco hauled trains. The present platforms were occupied by some goods lines. Those lines were a part of large Shalimar rail yard. In 2000, the first plan was conceived to use this area as a bigger rail station. The rapidly growing long distance passengers were gradually overcrowding the Howrah station. Due to the limitation of space, new platform construction is restricted at Howrah. Although 3 new platforms (17, 22 & 23) were constructed at Howrah during 2006 - 2008, those were not sufficient. Side by side, due to its almost central position in Howrah, Howrah station is too busy for both suburban and long distance rail traffic. Unlike Sealdah Station, Howrah Station has less suburban trains than long-distance trains. Due to increasing of Eastern Railway trains, many platforms, which were previously built for South Eastern Railway trains, now often occupied by Eastern Railway trains. But many people of Howrah feel that it is much easy to catch a long distance train from Howrah than Sealdah, particularly in early morning and late night. But due to platform limitation, increasing the number of long distance trains was not possible from Howrah for South Eastern Railway. To overcome this problem, South Eastern Railway suggested to Indian Railway officers to construct another bigger rail station at Howrah, mostly for long distance trains. The many underused tracks of Shalimar yard was the first choice of the authority. Construction started from 2000. The construction of platforms, station buildings,. and car parking area were started. After the completion, other tracks were re-aligned. The tracks around platform were completely electrified for passenger coaches shunting. At first, only one express train started. This train stopped later and then other long distance trains started. From this time, diesel loco hauled trains were replaced by EMU trains, which started suburban services. Services The station is served by the South Eastern Railway trains to Mecheda, Panskura, Kharagpur, Medinipur, Baripada and other places. The number of trains on suburban routes is lesser than those on long- distance trains. There are two platforms - Platform 1, which is used by only suburban trains and Platform 2, which is used by long-distance trains. The station is operated by the South Eastern Railway. Facilities There is a taxi stand and a toto (e-rickshaw) stand outside the station. The nearest tram terminus was formerly Shibpur, but it was closed in 1971. There are small eateries serving snacks on the platform and eateries serving lunch outside the station. Criticism As a new rail station, this station is not well connected by public transport. The most direct service to the station is taxi, which is not preferable by poor. All buses run along College Road, which is almost 1 km away from the station. It is often impossible to walk this 1 km with heavy luggage for a commuter. Due to the lack of transport link, many people avoid this station. An irregular steamer service from Garden Reach is also present. There is a plan to transfer part of the Howrah Station bus terminus to the front of the station, mainly for Kolkata bound routes, but nothing materialised.

The village had a population of 12 households and 3 bachelors, an estimated 83 persons, all Muslims.

He further noted; ‚ÄúAncient materials are plentiful there. I noticed in particular a number of column stumps and various fragments of sculptures coming from some building now destroyed. A church, converted later into a mosque, then into a stable, is quite well preserved. It had been built with alternately white and black stones, the former limestone, the latter basalt. On the lintel of the main entrance door one may observe, in the centre, a small circle, which formerly enclosed a cross, today completely effaced. Inside, some column shafts are lying on the ground, with their capitals broken.Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 136- 137; as translated in Pringle, 1998, p. 372 In 1882, it was described as an agricultural village of 120, built of adobe bricks. The Ottomans built an elementary school in this time period. A population list from about 1887 showed Aulam to have about 575 inhabitants; all Muslims.Schumacher, 1888, p. 186 =British Mandate era= The 'Arab al-Muwaylhat Bedouin tribe settled in the village by the time Awlam was a part of the British Mandate of Palestine.

The book, with product code TSR 9301,FA1 Halls of the High King from TSR Archive was published in 1990, and was written by Ed Greenwood, with cover art by Jeff Easley and interior art by Tim Bradstreet and Rick Harris. Contents The 64-page booklet is wrapped in a removable gatefold cover. The book includes a one-page introduction by Ed Greenwood, where he explains that this module takes place in the Moonshae Isles, which are ruled by Tristan Kendrick, High King of the Ffolk, and takes place after the Time of Troubles and the death of the god Bane. The adventure, on pages 3‚Äì36, is divided into five chapters: * Chapter 1: The Adventure Begins begins at any port city of the Sword Coast, such as Waterdeep or Baldur's Gate. A retired caravan master named Panthras hires the player characters (or PCs) to deliver a shipment of swords to the Cantrev of Aithe in Callidyrr, a kingdom on the Moonshae Isles, on behalf of High King Tristan Kendrick; a powerful wizard named Flamsterd will help in recruiting the PCs if needed. They set sail aboard the wooden merchant ship The Mermaid Sword, which is soon attacked by The Ghost Ship, a pirate ship whose crew is invisible. A member of the Risen Cult of Bane posing as a passenger sends undead called lacedons to attack so that he may steal the cargo. *Chapter 2: \\"Danger in Aithe\\" begins as the PCs arrive in the Moonshaes, in the port town of Aithelar. There, they are ambushed by archers and thugs hired by the Cult, before arriving at Aithe Keep to receive an audience with the town's Lord Cauldyth. He tells the PCs about the Cult and their devotion to the god Bane and that they can be found in the nearby Dernall Forest, usually called the Wild Wood. The PCs find Cult priests and their undead servants in the Dark Grove in the forest. *Chapter 3: Against the Dark Druid begins with the PCs traveling to the small village of Dultann, where they learn that the Cult is using the ruins of Darkhorn Castle as a base. The PCs encounter a number of undead and Cult members while exploring Castle Darkhorn, but are attacked by the Cult as they exit, and assisted by Harpers after the battle. The PCs learn that the Cult plans to make the Moonshaes into the personal realm of Bane, and are striking at Caer Callidyrr, the High King's castle. The PCs are sent through a mystical teleportation gate to defend the castle and save the king. *Chapter 4: The Halls of the High King begins as the PCs arrive, and the Cult immediately ambushes them. As soon as the PCs arrive in the throne room, 15 cultists have already infiltrated and begin their attack. The High King Tristan Kendrick and his bards defend themselves, as the Cult's polymorphed orcs and animated suits of armor called battle horrors join the fight. The Cult employs a man-sized disembodied floating black hand that acts as a teleporting gate when touched, sending them to the House of the Black Hand temple. *Chapter 5: The House of the Black Hand begins as the PCs use the black hand themselves to arrive in the Cult's temple. Exploring the House of the Black Hand leads the PCs into a number of battles with Cult members, eventually culminating in the destruction of their unholy altar. The remainder of the book consists of several appendices: *Appendix 1: Harping by Firelight (page 37) details a local custom in the Moonshaes of how anyone setting a campfire in the wilderness is duty-bound to share their campsite with any approaching traveler. *Appendix 2: The Risen Cult of Bane (pages 38‚Äì40) details the goals of the Risen Cult of Bane and its abilities, and described members the PCs are likely to encounter during the adventure. This section also gives statistics and details on the Son of Bane, the demigod Xvim. *Appendix 3: Monsters of the Moonshaes (pages 41‚Äì47) details monsters the bonebat, the helmed horror, the nishruu, the nyth, the peltast, the shee, and the weredragon. *Appendix 4: New Magic Items (pages 48‚Äì50) details new magic items that the PCs may discover, or that will be used by the Cult. *Appendix 5: New Spells (pages 51‚Äì54) likewise details new spells that will be used by the Cult or that other characters are likely to know. *Appendix 6: Campaign Adventuring in the Moonshaes (pages 55‚Äì56) presents some ideas for long-term adventuring in the Moonshaes, pointing at FR2 Moonshae as a useful source of adventure ideas as well and an essential resource for the setting. *Appendix 7: Sacred Groves & Moonwells (pages 57‚Äì61) details the properties and powers related to druidic groves, wooded gathering places dedicated to the Goddess, Chauntea. *Appendix 8: Current Moonshae Rumors (pages 62‚Äì64) gives a number of side-adventure ideas that can be used at any time during the adventure. One of these rumors included an all-too-true tale of how the necromancer Velsharoon was seeking demigodhood using the blood of adventurers. This module also includes a fold-out color poster map of several locales encountered in the module, including the House of the Black Hand, The Mermaid Sword, a partial map of Caer Callidyrr, and portions of Darkhorn Castle. The inside front cover contains a map of Cantrev Aithe and its vicinity, while the inside back cover contains a map of the town of Aithelar.

The duo consists of twin brothers Martin and Stefan Filipovski. Stefan fronts the band as the lead singer, while Martin plays the guitar and sings back-up vocals. The group represented the Republic of Macedonia at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow, Russia but failed to reach the final. History Next Time was formed in early 2008 after they signed with Plan B Production. Previously they performed as a garage band at children's music festivals. Discovered by composer and songwriter, Jovan Jovanov, the Macedonian duo released their first single \\"Ne veruvam vo tebe\\" (\\"I Don't Believe in You\\") in May, 2008. The song's lyrics were written by Next Time with Jovanov as the producer. \\"Ne veruvam vo tebe\\" immediately topped a number of charts in Macedonia and was quickly a hit which shot Next Time through the roof of the Macedonian music scene. The band also released their first music video for the song. Next Time's first festival appearance was at the First Radio Music Festival \\"Zvezdena Nok\\" in June, 2008. At \\"Zvezdena Nok\\", the duo won the \\"Summer Hit of the Year\\" award with their second song \\"Me misli≈° li?\\" (\\"Am I In Your Thoughts?\\"). Two months later at Ohrid Fest, Next Time were voted \\"Best New Artist\\" with their third single \\"Me ostavi sam da ≈æiveam\\" (\\"You Left Me All Alone\\"). Next Time's biggest festival success came in October when they won the second semi-final at MakFest. With their fourth single \\"Bez tebe tivko umiram\\" (\\"I'm Slowly Dying Without You\\") they went on to finish second in the final, only three points behind the winner. On the 16th of December, 2008, Next Time released their self-titled debut album. The Next Time Album featured 13 songs, two of which were bonus songs sung in a foreign language. One of the bonus songs was in English and was named \\"Why Did You Go\\". The other was a cover of the Italian pop-opera song \\"Caruso\\". The first four singles were all accompanied by music videos. With the release of their eponymous debut album, they quickly gained popularity and became prominent artists in the Macedonian music scene. In February 2009, Next Time competed at Skopje Fest, a Macedonian music competition and the national selection for the country's Eurovision Song Contest entry, performing the song Ne≈°to ≈°to kje ostane (Something That Will Remain).

He played for the Cleveland Indians in 1965 and 1968 and the Kansas City Royals from 1969 to 1972. Cleveland Indians Hedlund was born in Dallas, Texas, and signed as an amateur free agent with the Cleveland Indians upon graduation from Arlington High School in . He was just eighteen years old when he made his major league debut on May 8, against the Boston Red Sox. He appeared in just six games, and pitched a total of 5.1 innings before returning to the minors. He returned to the majors in as a September call up, and appeared in three games. After the season, he was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the 1968 Major League Baseball expansion draft. Kansas City Royals Hedlund went 3‚Äì6 with a 3.24 earned run average during the Royals' inaugural season. Used as both a starter and relief pitcher, he was far more effective out of the bullpen, posting a 1.69 ERA and earning two saves. His finest start came on September 18 when he held the Oakland Athletics to just one run, and struck out eight to earn the complete game victory. After the season, Hedlund pitched for Tiburones de La Guaira in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. He set a league record by not allowing an earned run for the first 53 innings he pitched, and finishing with a 0.75 ERA. While in Venezuela, Hedlund would contract the Hong Kong flu and bronchitis, causing him to lose thirty pounds. But he recovered and served as a reinforcement for the Navegantes del Magallanes, eventual champions of the 1970 Caribbean Series. Hedlund began the in the majors, but was ineffective, and was reassigned to the triple A Omaha Royals. In , the Royals boasted one of the most talented young starting rotations in the majors with Hedlund, Dick Drago and Paul Splittorff all under 27 years old. After narrowly avoiding one hundred losses in 1970, the Royals improved to 85‚Äì76, in 1971 to finish second in the American League West. For his part, Hedlund rebounded to go 15‚Äì8 in with the leagues fourth best ERA, 2.71. After the season, Hedlund traveled to Vietnam with a group of Major League ballplayers on a tour of hospitals and military bases. Hedlund started in the Royals' rotation, but after starting the season 0‚Äì5, was moved into the bullpen. He improved considerably at that point; winning his next four starts when used by manager Bob Lemon as a spot starter. At the 1972 Winter meetings he was traded back to the Cleveland Indians for utility infielder Kurt Bevacqua. Minor leagues The Indians intended to use Hedlund as a long reliever and spot starter, but he failed to make the club out of Spring training. He spent the entire season with the triple A Oklahoma City 89ers, going 7‚Äì8 with a 4.44 ERA. The following Spring, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox for minor league outfielder Ken Hottman. Despite a respectable 2.90 ERA, Hedlund was 5‚Äì8 in for the Iowa Oaks. He was traded again after the season, this time to the Cincinnati Reds for Ozzie Osborn, but never played a game with them at any level.

It was introduced in June 1997About SiS > History , SiS, accessed December 26, 2008. and became available to the consumer market in the end of that year. Although its performance was low compared to the GPUs of its age, eventually it became very successful, specially integrated in many motherboards designed to the corporate market, where the low cost is prioritized over 3D performance. SiS shipped over seven million units of the SiS 6326 in 1998.  Architecture  The SiS was available as a discrete card, with an AGP 2x or PCI bus, and as an integrated GPU. It had a 64-bit 2D/3D graphics accelerator, a DVD decoder, a TV decoder. It was available with 4 MB or 8 MB of memory.  Performance  Since the model aimed for low cost over high performance, its capabilities were low compared to contemporary products. According to a test conducted by Tom's Hardware on January 21, 1998, it possessed roughly a third of the performance of an NVidia RIVA 128 or 40% less than an ATI Rage Pro in terms of frames per second in Direct3D benchmarks, and simply could not play Quake 2 due to its lack of OpenGL support.3D Accelerator Review Step One - 3D Performance, the Real Deal, Tom's Hardware, accessed January 25, 2010 Yet the same article says that even the \\"slow and unknown graphic chip\\" could still produce \\"quite nice image quality\\". A beta driver codenamed Java was released as late as 1999, being the only version with an OpenGL ICD included, which finally allowed it to run some OpenGL applications such as GLQuake, Quake 2 and GLexcess. it still crashes in Quake 3 though, due to its incomplete 3D features. The SiS 6326 was even capable of running relatively newer 3D applications such as 3DMark2001/2001, with no significant image flaws to be found despite its abysmal speed.  Linux support  There is little support for Linux aside from the drivers developed independently by Thomas Winischhofer.http://www.winischhofer.net/linuxsisvga.shtml Since the driver does not support OpenGL, not even the Windows one provided by SiS, it only allows for 2D acceleration. There is also an experimental FrameBuffer driver developed by Sergio Costas,http://www.rastersoft.com/sis6326fbeng.html currently unsupported, available only for 2.4 kernels and without any kind of hardware acceleration. This driver was not ported to 2.6 because the native VesaFB driver available offered the same capabilities.  Variants and immediate successors  In 1998, DVD/Macro-Vision and then AGP variants of the SiS6326 were released. Later that year, northbridge chipsets with integrated GPUs were released: SiS530 for Socket 7, and SiS620 for socket 370. It was in April 1999 that the SiS6326 became officially obsolete by the SiS 300.Press Room > Press Release, SiS accessed January 25, 2010.

However, a distinct, disease-defining genetic alteration recently described for EHE indicates that it is an entirely separate entity from both angiosarcoma and hemangioma. EHE is a soft tissue sarcoma and is generally considered a vascular cancer insofar as the ‚Äòlesional‚Äô cells have surface markers typical of endothelial cells (cells lining the interior of blood vessels). EHE was originally described as occurring most commonly in the veins of the extremities (arms and legs) and two organs, the liver and lungs. It has since been described in organs throughout the body. In addition to liver and lungs, bones and skin have been the most frequent organs. Before the initial description of Weiss, the tumor had been reported under a variety of other names, including histiocytoid hemangioendothelioma, intravascular bronchoalveolar tumor (in the lung), and sclerosing cholangiocarcinoma. In the lung and liver, common sites of metastatic tumor, it was most likely to be confused with carcinoma a far more common type of tumor. EHE typically occurs in the 20 ‚Äì 40 age range although the overall age range involved is much broader and a modest predilection for females over males. It often has an indolent course, and many affected people have survived for decades with multi-organ disease.[1]:601 The extent and number of organs involved apparently has little effect on longevity. Genetics The cytogenetics of EHE gave some of the first clues of an underlying genetic alteration. A balanced, reciprocal translocation t(1;3)(p36.3;q25) in EHE tumor cells was first described by Mendlick et al. in 2001 (). This led to the landmark paper by Tanas et al. in 2011() describing the specific genes involved in the translocation associated with the most common forms of EHE. This alteration results in the fusion of genes coding for two transcription co-activators (transcriptional regulators): TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif) also known as WWTR1 (WW domain-containing transcription regulator protein 1) and CAMTA1 (calmodulin- binding transcription activator 1). The names in parenthesis are not relevant to casual (or even science) readers but are included to help distinguish them from other genes. For instance, another gene with an entirely different function, Tafazzin, is unrelated to EHE but confusingly, also referred to as TAZ. In any case, the EHE translocation results in an abnormal ‚Äòfusion gene‚Äô that expresses an abnormal mRNA resulting in synthesis of a fusion protein variant of TAZ that is always turned on. This form of TAZ always resides in the nucleus and therefore is constitutively active. It binds and turns on a very important member of the TEAD family of transcription factors and this causes cells to proliferate. It is this production of the TAZ-TEAD transcriptome that causes the affected endothelial cells to grow into tumors. In normal cells, TAZ is considered a major negative transducer of the Hippo pathway, a signaling system that regulates organ size by causing cells to stop growing when they touch each other (contact inhibition). Many upstream inputs regulate the Hippo signal which normally functions to turn off or de-activate TAZ by keeping it in the cytoplasm and out of the nucleus. In EHE cells, the abnormal fusion TAZ is ‚Äòimmune‚Äô to this input and just stays in the nucleus, and continuing to stimulate cell growth. Note that about 10% of EHE patients harbor a different translocation. This one similarly results in the constitutive activation of YAP, an orthologue of TAZ (i.e., a gene that has sequence and function that are very similar to TAZ). This also results in persistent, unregulated growth of the affected cells and therefore causes EHE- type tumors. Treatment ‚Ä¢Sirolimus: Also known as rapamycin, this oral medication suppresses the immune system and slows the growth of abnormal lymphatic vessels that form the tumor. This can help shrink EHE tumors and improve symptoms, including pain ‚Ä¢Tyrosine kinase inhibitors: These drugs, designed as targeted therapies for cancers, have shown short-term success with EHE. Examples include sorafenib, sunitinib and pazopanib. ‚Ä¢Vincristine: This chemotherapy drug targets all dividing cells within the body and is therefore used to treat many cancers. It is also used for aggressive benign vascular tumors. Interferon: The body produces interferon to combat infections or control inflammation. It has been formulated into a medication that targets blood vessel growth. ‚Ä¢Multi-agent chemotherapy: EHE tumors that grow rapidly, spread to other tissues or do not respond to other medications may require more aggressive drug therapy. However, this combination of medications is rarely needed in children and young adults with EHE. ‚Ä¢Others like surgery can be done as treatment for the virus during its most severe. Prognosis Although Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma typically presents as a low-grade tumor, occasionally, eHAE presents as high grade and more aggressive. eHAE presenting in the pleura, for example, is associated with a much more aggressive and hard to treat course. There is no standard chemotherapy treatment for eHAE at current but success with drugs such as Interferon, Paclitaxel, MAID combination chemotherapy, Thalidomide and Doxorubicin have been reported. Epidemiology It is so rare that only 0.01 percent of the cancer population has it and it affects about 1 person in every 1,000,000 worldwide.http://www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site844/mainpageS844P1.html Around 20 cases are diagnosed in America every year ‚Äì the cause is unknown. It is unresponsive to any known strain of chemotherapy, making treatment very difficult. Society There is a Facebook site set up for people with EHE. There is also a Registry for patients to enter their medical history. CRAVAT Center for Research and Analysis of VAscular Tumors is a website for the EHE community. The EHE Rare Cancer Foundation Australia was established in 2015 by Australians with Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma (EHE). The core objective of the EHE Rare Cancer Foundation Australia is to proactively fundraise in order to support research into this rare cancer in the hope that a maintenance program or cure can be found. In 2003 photographer and actress Kris Carr was diagnosed with a stable and low grade version of eHAE.

The unit has no aircraft of its own and its airborne personnel conduct operations by being dropped from other units' aircraft. The unit has seven SAR teams located in seven states. Each Para-SAR detachment is made up of SAR qualified military parachutists. Members of this unit can be distinguished by their maroon berets and orange baseball caps.  History  The Brazilian Air Force has a long history of parachute training. In 1943, at the former Afonsos Field School of Aeronautics and with the support of the Air Force, cadet academy instructor Achile Garcia Charles Astor first introduced civil parachute training in Brazil. Seeing the usefulness of having a parachuting unit, the Electronics and Flight Protection Administration conducted studies to see how such a unit could be created under the auspices of the air force. The results of that study gave rise to the Para-SAR. In 1946, the Brazilian Army formed its parachute school, the now- named General Penha Brazil Parachutist's Instruction Center. It graduated its first class of Brazilian Air Force students in 1959. The group initially consisted of a division of three officers and five sergeants whose mandate was to provide instruction to the cadets of the School of Aeronautics and to provide search and rescue, by means of the DEPV. The unit also consisted of a group of volunteers who trained at the old military aviation school and went on to provide help in accidents and under special circumstances. Eventually, on 2 September 1963, the Airborne Rescue unit was formed. Para-SAR is the traditional name given to the search and rescue arm of the air force and is housed in the old School of Aeronautics. By November 20, 1973, the flotilla no longer existed, becoming the Airborne Rescue Squadron, or EAS. Its mandate was to continue training of the BAF parachutists, the instruction and the administration of the rescue teams and helicopter squadrons among other tasks.  Mission  The Para-SAR mandate includes specialized instruction for crewmembers and rescue teams of the Brazilian Air Force, SAR and special operations.  Training  New members of the squadron start with the Brazilian Army parachute course and then complete courses such as parachute packing and maintenance, aerial resupply, demolition, sniper and jungle warfare. They then move onto advanced training. The following training programs are offered by the squadron: = Search and rescue = This course includes: aircraft access; firefighting; machines, engines and radio equipment; free diving; helilift operations; orientation and ground searches; sea and jungle survival; SAR combat tactics; mountaineering; search and rescue theory and first aid. = Scuba diving = Graduates become qualified in scuba diving which is typically used to recover charges and pieces of submerged aircraft. = Airborne techniques = Graduates are qualified to parachute out of a military aircraft as well as air drop supplies, precision landing, calculate the effects of wind and carry out the pathfinder role. They also learn packing, inspecting and repairing parachutes. Also taught are techniques for aircraft operations using the Lockheed C-130 Hercules and C-95. = Skydiving = The course teaches parachutists operational skydiving, the use of instruments and equipment; skydiving from both low and high altitudes and jumping with weapons and equipment for military operations. = Master skydiver = Graduates of this course become qualified in all aspects of skydiving, from organizing the jump team to coordinating the aircraft to be used. Students are also given a knowledge of meteorology and reading weather reports as well as precision targeting, advanced navigation skills and techniques of free fall Basic Body Fly. = Commando = The Brazilian Air Force commando course teaches combat search and rescue, including locating downed crews in a hostile environment, survival, evasion, resistance and escape. The course also covers counter-terrorism, reconnaissance and sabotage subjects.

He was born in Henrico County, Virginia and became a plantation owner and operator of Robert Pleasants & Co., a consignment tobacco exporting company.‚ÄúRobert Pleasants,‚Äù Special Collections Research Center His father, John Pleasants, also a Quaker and member of the Curles Neck Meeting, wrote a will asking his heirs to free over 500 slaves when they reached 30 years of age. Contacts with the anti-slavery advocate Anthony Benezet and what became the Pennsylvania Abolition Society in 1774, spurred their commitment to the abolitionist movement. However, testamentary manumission provisions were illegal in Virginia when John Pleasants died in 1771. Robert Pleasants lobbied Virginia legislators to allow manumissions, and when such became legal in 1782, freed his slaves, then hired them as paid laborers and provided for their education.Kevin J. Hayes, \\"The Mind of a Patriot.\\" University of Virginia Press, 2008. Robert Pleasants also hired John Marshall and initiated Pleasants v Pleasants as executor of his father's will and on behalf of the slaves that his siblings failed to free despite the will's provision. They won before Chancellor George Wythe, but his ruling was greatly restricted by the Court of Appeals led by Edmund Pendleton. Pleasants ended up giving about 78 former slaves over 350 acres of land, and by 1801 founded the Gravelly Hill School, the first educational institution for free blacks in Virginia.‚ÄúHistory and Archives,‚Äù Richmond Friends Meeting (Quakers) The Civil War Battle of Glendale was fought on the property, part of which was eventually rebuilt as the Gravel Hill Baptist Church. Robert Pleasants was also one of the founders of the short-lived Virginia Abolition Society, and served as its president in 1790. The society disbanded after Virginia passed a law in 1798 forbidding abolitionists from sitting on juries in freedom suit cases. Meanwhile, Pleasants submitted numerous petitions to the Virginia state government and the U.S. Congress calling for the end of the slave trade. The most famous, from 1791, is now at the Library of Virginia. Many of Pleasants' letters to George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry regarding the legality and morality of slavery still survive. The Swem Library at the College of William and Mary holds many of his papers.

However, the final design had the height reduced to 268m. South Asian Gate was originally scheduled to be completed in 2012 or 2013. But construction on the main tower never got off the ground, even though it progressed on other components. As of 2017, construction is stalled. The project went through several re-designs. The first design had 288 metres and 72 storeys. The Department of Construction did not approve it, because Yunnan is a seismically active region and the design would not be safe in a strong earthquake. It was revised to 316m, 81 storeys. Again it was turned down. It was approved the third time at 333m and 83 storeys. The approved design has two separate towers, equal in height. The space between the towers looks like a Yunnan-style pagoda. The two towers were later replaced with one tower at the same height. The design of the tower was again changed and the height reduced to finally become 268m. The South Asian Gate will be home to a five-star hotel, serviced apartments, grade-A office space, residential apartments, a commercial area, and leisure and entertainment facilities.

But in Day shift, it is only for Class 6 to 10. There is an additional non governmental section in the school for class 1 to 5. The students pass from the additional shift, can directly admit in the Day shift. Every year about approximately 500 students appear in the PEC, JSC & SSC examination, with about half in Science, and half in Business Studies. Admission Under the control of Directorate General of Secondary and Higher Education, Dhaka admission lotteries of all the government schools of Dhaka city are taken. There is no intense competition in the admission process. Students are selected to study at this school by lottery. Usually students are admitted in classes 1,6 and 9. Admission can be considered in other classes if a vacancy is created. The admission test is taken usually in December after the annual exam. Guardian teacher conference To make each students best from better, a conference is called where they discuss the problems of a student and how to remove those. Thus this school gradually makes good results in PEC, JSC & SSC. School magazine The name of the magazine of the school is UDDIPON (‡¶â‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßÄ‡¶™‡¶®). The magazine is not published regularly every year. It is published after every 4 years. The school magazine is a historical document of the growth of the school. It informs the future generation of students about the traditions built up of their school. This valuable publication is the opportunity that students require to show their creative talents. Along with academic studies, students are encouraged in games and athletics, art and craft, science clubs, dramatics and various other activities. These make the years in school interesting and worth remembering. But intellectual activities like debates, elocution and essay-writing competitions are rarely found. The school magazine is the window to the activities of the school. Proper initiative by the teachers can help in improving the views and expressions of the students which in turn will raise the standard of the magazine.

Fan cooled motors feature an axial fan attached to the rotor of the motor (usually on the opposite end as the output shaft) that spins with the motor, providing increased airflow to the motor's internal and external parts which aids in cooling. right  Uses  Fan cooled motors have many common uses in motors that either produce a lot of heat or have poor airflow because they are always stationary or in an enclosed space and require a compact cooling system. They are common for industrial uses, household appliances such as blenders and mixers, power tools such as drills and rotary tools, and radio-controlled cars  Advantages  Attaching an internal fan to a motor is a fairly simple way to cool it. Since a fan cooled motor always provides airflow over itself regardless of whether it is stationary or partially enclosed, it is more effective than using a heat sink in applications with poor airflow because heat sinks usually require air to be flowing over them for maximum effectiveness. Internal fan cooling also takes up far less space than external fan cooling or water cooling.  Disadvantages  All fans generate noise, something that may not be desired in a motor, and drag on their power source. Also, like any device with a fan, increased airflow through the motor can cause increased dust build up, which could potentially hinder the motor's operation.

It was tasked to strengthen coordination amongst Singapore's existing security agencies (The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), Singapore Police Force, Internal Security Department, the Security and Intelligence Division).https://www.nscs.gov.sg/public-data/doc/speeches/2004/The-Strategic- Framework-for-Singapores-National-Security.pdf History In 1999, the National Security Secretariat (NSS) was set up to forge and strengthen inter- agency links through the strategic convergence of these organisations and other relevant government ministries, directing efforts against the emerging threats of non-conventional warfare and transnational terrorism. With the advent of the terrorist incidents taking place in the United States of America on Sept 11, 2001, the NSS was responsible for implementing several ad hoc coordinating arrangements to protect Singapore from subsequent attacks. These ad hoc coordinating arrangements were known to relate to areas in terms of aviation, land transport and maritime security. It is possible that through the work of the NSS, the Singapore Armed Forces began researching into rearranging itself into a task based force structure, with a dedicated focus in a new operational area of homeland defence. SAF soldiers following Sept 11, 2001 began to be deployed to Key Installation sites, known as KINS, in support of the Ministry of Home Affairs. These areas cover Changi International Airport, Sembawang Wharves, and the oil refineries situated on Jurong Island. The SAF and Singapore Civil Defence Force also began parallel efforts to develop measures to counter chemical and biological warfare. With the SAF, a battalion equivalent of forces commenced development of the CBRE group - Chemical Biological Radiological and Explosives ordnance group, which was rightfully an expansion of its chemical warfare capability. The SCDF strengthened the development of its HAZMAT (Hazardous Material) forces. Ad Hoc arrangements gradually became regarded as insufficient to meet the new security landscape, and the NSS recognised that there was a crucial need for not merely the security agencies, but rather all ministries to work together to develop a whole-of-government approach towards handling modern day security threats. From 2003 onwards, it was decided that formulating relevant security policy and implementing integrated and coordinated approaches would be best done through a small coordination unit that was managed at the Prime minister's level - As such the NSS would be headed at the Prime Minister's Office. On 20 July 2004, in Parliament, then Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Tony Tan laid out the case for a new Strategic Framework for national security in Parliament. This framework sought to address the issues and close the gaps identified, and put in place the machinery to enable the government to systematically deal with the security issues confronting Singapore. Included within the framework was the plan to re-describe the NSS as the National Security Coordination Secretariat (NSCS) - which was established under the Prime Minister's Office and tasked with national security planning and the coordination of policy and intelligence issues. The NSS was renamed the National Security Coordination Centre (NSCC) and together with the Joint Counter Terrorism Centre (JCTC) formed up the NSCS.

(Baum's adult novel The Last Egyptian, issued in the same period, bears a copyright date of 1907 and a publication date of 1908.) Background In writing the book, Baum faced the task of creating an effective sequel to a successful novel. He enriched his story with abundant real-world observation and local color. Baum and his wife had taken an extensive tour of Egypt and the Mediterranean region in the first six months of 1906; and Baum exploited the experiences of that trip for his book.Frank Joslyn Baum and Russell P.

The Baums had witnessed the eruption of Vesuvius on April 7, 1906; Baum used the eruption as a central event in his novel.

Synopsis The second book in the Aunt Jane's series picks up where the first left off. The eccentric and down-to- earth millionaire John Merrick decides to take his three beloved nieces ‚Äì Patsy Doyle, Elizabeth de Graf, and Louise Merrick ‚Äì on a tour of Europe. The parents of the three girls react variously, but don't oppose the trip; Mrs. Merrick, Louise's mother, wants to accompany them as chaperone, a prospect that Uncle John rejects out of hand. Still, Mrs. Merrick allows her daughter to go; she wants to separate Louise from Arthur Weldon, the young man who has been courting her. (The social-climbing Mrs. Merrick is desperate for Louise to land a rich husband. Weldon's father is a wealthy railroad magnate, but the father and son are in a clash of generations and the elder Weldon threatens to disown the younger). Uncle John and the three cousins embark for Europe, and make new acquaintances aboard ship. Among them is a somewhat sinister and mysterious man called Victor Valdi, who combines \\"refinement and barbarity\\" in his manner. Patsy goes out of her way to draw him out of his sullen silence, to \\"make him talk and 'be sociable'.\\"Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad, pp. 42, 45. The tourists reach Italy, where they witness an eruption by Vesuvius and cope with the public's fears and a layer of ash in the streets of Naples. They consider a detour, but decide to carry on intrepidly. They encounter a local aristocrat, the Count of Ferralti, who fancies Louise ‚Äì though the clever Uncle John quickly realizes that he is only a pretend nobleman. John warns Louise of the young man's pretense, but otherwise allows the acquaintance, especially when Ferralti proves a courageous help in a near-disaster on the road. At Taormina, the travelers meet Victor Valdi again; he appears more sinister and mysterious than ever in his native element, where he is called \\"Il Duca.\\" There is much talk of the danger of \\"brigands\\" in Sicily ‚Äî though the local people cheerfully insist that \\"There are no brigands\\" in Sicily, an ironic refrain that winds through the book.Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad, pp. 164, 170, 174 and ff. Quickly enough, both Uncle John and Ferralti are waylaid by Valdi, who is the chief local brigand, and makes a living for his family and followers by kidnapping tourists and holding them for ransom. Uncle John learns the ways of Valdi's curious establishment, which includes his ruthless mother and his daughter Tato, who masquerades as a boy to serve as her father's henchman. After initial resistance, Uncle John reconciles himself to paying the ransom for his life and freedom; but his nieces and friends are unwilling to yield to bandits, and stage a bold and effective rescue of Uncle John and Ferralti. It is revealed that the false Count Ferralti is actually Arthur Weldon; he has come to Europe in disguise to be with Louise. Uncle John lets the two young people continue to see each other, as long as there is no talk of marriage yet. (News has arrived that Weldon's father has died in a railway accident, and that Arthur is now a wealthy heir.) The Americans are surprised a few days later, when Valdi and Tato appear at their hotel. While Tato was acting as the go-between in the ransom plot, the girl and Patsy had become something like friends; with typical generosity of spirit, Patsy does not blame the girl for the actions of her family. Now, Valdi asks the Americans to take Tato under their charge for a time; Valdi is trying to leave brigandage behind and take up an honest life. The cousins naively accept Tato, and enjoy dressing her in a new wardrobe and teaching her manners. They are surprised again when Tato absconds with the ransom cash ($50,000 of Uncle John's money and $30,000 of Weldon's); the girl leaves a cheerful but mocking letter behind her, explaining the ruse. Having learned their lesson, the travelers complete their tour through Italy, Switzerland, and France, and gratefully return home. Americans and guns Throughout the book, the characters place great stress on their special nationality. This is most noticeable in their confrontation with Valdi and his kidnap plot. Beth puts it most blatantly when she cries, \\"It's a beastly shame that free born Americans should be enslaved by a crew of thieving Sicilians, and obliged to purchase their freedom!\\"Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad, pp. 259-60. ‚Äî but the other characters are nearly as vocal. (The word \\"American,\\" singular or plural, occurs 58 times in Baum's text.) Valdi is a supremely successful brigand, until he encounters the Americans' pride, courage, and resourcefulness; conversely, the Americans' frank and generous kindness leaves them open to victimization. The patriotic self-satisfaction turns ugly only once, when Patsy \\"gleefully\\" tells her Uncle John after his rescue, \\"Did you think your nieces would let you be robbed by a bunch of dagoes?\\"Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad, p. 291. (Perhaps momentary high spirits can excuse the normally better-behaved girl). The Americans are so formidable in part because they are so heavily armed. Beth carries her \\"pet revolver\\" and Uncle John has two in his trunks; \\"cousin\\" Kenneth Forbes and American friend Silas Watson carry guns when in Sicily. As the cousins prepare to rescue Uncle John and Ferralti/Weldon, Patsy sticks a \\"pop-gun\\" in \\"the bosom of her dress....\\" When Kenneth asks her if she can shoot, she replies, \\"No, but I suppose the pistol can. I know enough to pull the trigger.\\"Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad, p. 274. Characters To make his sequel effective, Baum needed to develop and deepen his continuing characters. In the first book, Louise was willing to follow her mother's lead in searching for a rich husband; but in the second she favors Arthur Weldon even when he runs a risk of disinheritance, suggesting a greater sincerity, sensitivity, and independence. Beth is the most formidable of the cousins; she carries a revolver and is a crack shot. Yet in the climactic confrontation with Valdi, she faints when the bullet she fires hits Valdi's finger and draws blood; afterward she swears she will never fire a weapon again. This display of a softer side tends to balance out her personality. Even Kenneth Forbes, the cousin who actually inherited Aunt Jane's estate in the first book, reveals unexpected depths of pluck and spirit.

Hoskins was the first African American to play in the minor league Texas League, pitching for the Double-A Dallas Eagles in 1952. He faced much the same kind of hostility that Jackie Robinson did when he first broke into the majors five years earlier. Though players loved him, some fans cursed and taunted him, especially outside Dallas. At first, he was not allowed to play in Shreveport when the Eagles traveled there to play the Shreveport Sports. Hoskins won 22 games for the Dallas Eagles in 1952 with a 2.12 earned run average. The pitcher made the All-Star team and also hit .328, an outstanding average for a pitcher. Six years later, he won 17 more games for the renamed Dallas Rangers in the same circuit. Hoskins made the big-league Indians in 1953, going 9-3 with a 3.99 ERA. The following year, he had an ERA of 3.04, as the Indians won the American League pennant. Hoskins' professional career began in the Negro leagues with the Homestead Grays, and continued from 1949 to 1960 in minor and Major League baseball. In major league innings, Hoskins allowed 131 hits and 48 bases on balls. He struck out 64. As a hitter, Hoskins was better than average, posting a .227 batting average (15-for-66) with 12 runs, 1 home run and 9 RBI. He was used as a pinch-hitter 16 times in his brief major league career. Defensively, he handled 31 total chances (9 putouts, 31 assists) without an error for a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage. Hoskins died in Flint, Michigan in 1970 at 44 years of age.

Disused since the war as an airfield, the former base is private property used for mustering cattle and horses. An arch marks the western edge of the strip, easily accessible from the main road. With permission of the owner, visitors can tour the strip. On the eastern edge of the strip are concrete pads from former buildings including the mess hall and first air station. Also, there are the remains of a B-26 crash site and a former 2nd BS camp area. Small markers, left by veterans in 1992 mark these locations. History The airfield, which had a single main runway running east to west, was built by the United States Army Air Forces. Two units were based at the airfield: * 2nd Bombardment Squadron, 22nd Bombardment Group, 9 April-9 October 1942 * 408th Bombardment Squadron, 22nd Bombardment Group (later re-designated the 18th Reconnaissance Squadron), 12 April-15 October 1942 Both squadrons initially flew B-26 Marauder medium bombers. The first mission by the 408th BS was on 22 April 1942 from Reid River, operating until January 1943 when the group went on R&R.; In early February 1943, both the 2nd and 408th Squadrons converted from B-26 to B-25 Mitchell bombers when it was decided to send the B-26s to the Mediterranean Theatre.

His research focuses on the neurobiology of human cognition, particularly cortical organization for language and memory, which he investigates in the context of awake neurosurgery under local anesthesia. In order to study these aspects of cognition, Ojemann utilizes techniques ranging from electrical stimulation mapping to recording of activity of single neurons, which have resulted in methods for reducing the risk of cortical resections for epilepsy and tumors.  Early life  Ojemann received a B.A. in 1956 from the University of Iowa, having served in the Air Force wing of the ROTC and being elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He was awarded the University's Brigg's award on graduation for having the highest cumulative GPA for the four undergraduate years.  Medical career  To begin Dr. Ojemann received a M.D. in 1959, from the University of Iowa. During that time, he had developed an interest in neurology, under the guidance of Dr. Adolph Sahs, best known for his work in the natural history of subarachnoid hemorrhage from aneurysms. During his medical school years, he had completed a rotation in neurosurgery as Massachusetts General Hospital. He received the MacEwen prize for top academic performance throughout medical school and was elected AOA president his junior year. He then completed training in the field of neurosurgery at King County Hospital (now Harborview Medical Center) in Seattle and the University of Washington, followed by further specialty training in surgical neurology at the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Ojemann's career has combined clinical practices specializing in the surgical treatment of medically refractory epilepsy and brain tumors in functionally eloquent areas of the brain, with research into the neurobiology of human cognition particularly language and memory. These studies have been done in the context of awake operations under local anesthesia, utilizing techniques including electrical stimulation mapping and recording of single neuron activity. From them methods for reducing the risk of cortical resections were developed. For this work the Society of Neurological surgeons awarded him a prize for \\"Outstanding Continuous Commitment to Research in the Neurosciences by a Neurological Surgeon\\" (1984), the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke a Javits Neuroscience Award (1984), the Medical College of Ohio an honorary Doctor of Science degree (1998), the K.J. Zulch Prize of the Maz- Planck Society for Basic Neurological Research (2000), the Cloward Medal of the Western Neurosurgical Society (2003), and he received Distinguished Alumni Awards from the University of Iowa (1991) and the University of Washington Medical School (2014). He is a past Director of the American Board of Neurological Surgery (1987-1993, chairman 1992-3), a member of the Residency Review Committee for Neurosurgery (1993‚Äì97), and President of the American Academy of Neurological Surgery in 1999-2000. He was a member of the Advisory Committee of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (1997-2000) and that institute's Board of Scientific Counselors (1985‚Äì89). He Also, served as a military surgeon for the United States Public Health Service from 1964-66 where he then returned to Seattle in 1966, he has been affiliated with the neurosurgical faculty at UW since that time. He was board certified in 1967 by the American Board of Neurological Surgery. He is now married to Dr. Linda Moretti, a neurologist with shared interests in the treatment of epilepsy. They have three children, all physicians: two neurological surgeons. Ojemann served as director of the Washington Epilepsy Center at Harborview from 1986‚Äì1996, serves as a consultant for the Veteran's Administration Hospital, and is on the editorial boards of several scholarly journals in the fields of neurosurgery and neurology.  Research  He is the author of over 300 research papers and chapters most on the surgical treatment of epilepsy or the neurobiology of human cognition, and several books on the brain for the general public.  Publications  He is the co-author of two books with William H. Calvin, Ph.D.: Inside the Brain was published in September 1980, and Conversations with Neil's Brain: the Neural Nature of Thought and Language in April 1995.

It was released as the telenovela was coming to an end in June 1991. The telenovela's fictional pop band Mu√±ecos de Papel was formed by Sasha, Ricky Martin, Bibi Gaytan, Pedro Fernandez, Erick Rubin and Angelica Rivera. This album includes the voices of Bibi Gaytan and Erick Rubin - both Bibi and Erick had been omitted from the Mu√±ecos de Papel album, released months earlier by Sony. It is, however, unclear whether Sasha, Pedro Fernandez and Angelica Rivera contributed backing vocals to the only group song in Alcanzar una estrella II, \\"No quiero dejar de brillar\\" - Bibi Gaytan, Erick Rubin and Ricky Martin all have solo verses but the other members do not, and the credits do not include this information. \\"No quiero dejar de brillar\\" did not achieve the success of the group's previous single \\"Mu√±eco de Papel\\". The song is not attributed to the fictional band Mu√±ecos de Papel, but instead it's credited to \\"Estrellas de Alcanzar una Estrella\\" (Stars from Alcanzar una Estrella) - which might indicate that it was not recorded by all six members of the group. Further evidence is the fact that there are no Mu√±ecos de Papel photos in the artwork, and the back cover only features Gaytan and Rubin (then under contract with Melody), as well as other cast members who were not part of Mu√±ecos de Papel but did contribute songs: Angelica Ruvalcaba, Marisa De Lille and Hector Suarez Gomis. There are no images of Sasha, Martin, Fernandez or Rivera. The album was not as successful as Mu√±ecos de Papel; still, Bibi Gaytan had her first solo hit with the single \\"Tan solo una mujer\\".

He was the chairman of the council of eight men, which was a part of early steps toward representative democracy in the Dutch colony. Early life Cornelis Melyn was born in Antwerp, then a part of the Spanish Netherlands, where he was baptised at St. Walburga Church September 17, 1600, the son of Andries and Maria (Gheudinx-Botens) Melyn, and grandson of Lambrecht Melyn, of the same place. Both of Cornelis' parents died in 1606. Two guardians, Jacques Melyn and Hans Salomons, were appointed for him and he was taken into the family of his half-brother Abraham Melyn to be raised. When he was about twelve years of age, Cornelis was apprenticed as a tailor. When Melyn was about 18 years old, the priest of St. Walburga Church issued him a baptismal certificate and a certificate of good conduct. It is possible he left Antwerp at this time for Amsterdam, where he married Janneken Adriaens in 1627. Their marriage certificateBetrothal Certificate of Cornelis MELIJN & Jannetie ARIAENSS, 22 April 1627, Amsterdam lists them both as residing in Amsterdam. By this time, Melyn had changed his occupation, being listed in this certificate as a seemtouwer, a \\"dresser of the finer and softer leathers\\". Migration to New Amsterdam Cornelis Melyn made at least one voyage to the New World before deciding to settle there, as supercargoFrijhoff, Willem. Fulfilling God's Mission: The Two Worlds of Dominie Everardus Bogardus, 1607-1647, BRILL, 2007, , p. 495 aboard the Dutch West India Company's ship Het Wapen van Noorwegen (The Arms of Norway) in 1638. After returning to the Netherlands, he applied for the Patroonship of Staten Island, which he was granted July 3, 1640. Soon afterwards, he sailed, possibly in the Engel Gabriel (Angel Gabriel), for New Netherland. But the vessel was captured by a Dunkirk raider August 13, 1640, and Melyn was forced to return to the Netherlands. Melyn sailed once again to New Amsterdam May 17, 1641, aboard the vessel Den Eyckenboom (The Oak Tree) with a new party of colonists, including his wife and children. Also on board was Adriaen van der Donck who would one day be a political ally of Melyn and a fellow victim of Director-General Peter Stuyvesant's persecution. Soon after The Oak Tree's arrival in New Amsterdam, Cornelis Melyn and his party of 41 persons were at work establishing a new colony on Staten Island. June 19, 1642, Melyn received from Director-General Willem Kieft his patent to all of Staten Island except for a farm which had already been allocated to David Pietersen de Vries. Leadership In November 1643, during the bloody conflict with the neighboring Lenape tribes which became known as Kieft's War, Melyn and his colonists were forced to abandon Staten Island. According to his own statement, \\"I was obliged to flee for the sake of saving my life, and to sojourn with wife and children at the Menatans till the year 1647.\\" In 1644, his plantation having been destroyed, Cornelis Melyn purchased three adjacent lots near the Dutch fort on lower Manhattan, along the East River near the intersection of the present Broad and Pearl Streets. He settled there with his family for the next three years. As the Dutch colony drifted into chaos and some colonists expressed outrage at what they considered Kieft's ineptitude, the Director-General sought to placate his critics by appointing a council of eight men, with Cornelis Melyn as chairman, to assist him in governing the colony. This body, which was supposed to represent the people of New Amsterdam, was one of the earliest steps toward representative democracy in that colony. The colonists' opposition to Kieft continued, however, and the council demanded his removal in a letter transmitted to the States-General of the Netherlands in October 1644. Melyn is attributed with having written the Vertoogh van Nieu Nederland' ('A Tale of New Netherland'), considered one of earliest descriptions of life in colony and condemnation of Dutch West Indies Company policies. Conflict With Stuyvesant In 1647, when Peter Stuyvesant arrived in New Amsterdam to replace Kieft as Director-General, Melyn and Jochem Pietersen Kuyter, acting in name of the citizens of New Amsterdam, brought charges against the outgoing governor, demanding an investigation of his conduct while in office. Recognizing the danger of such actions to his own administration, Stuyvesant refused to consider Melyn and Kuyter's demands and caused them to be tried for l√®se-majest√©. The case was quickly decided against the defendants, who were sentenced to banishment from the colony. August 16, 1647, Kuyter and Melyn sailed aboard the Princess Amelia to appeal their convictions to the States-General.Russell Shorto, The Island at the Center of the World: The Epic Story of Dutch Manhattan and the Forgotten Colony that Shaped America. First Edition. New York City: Vintage Books (a Division of Random House, 2004), p.179. Their vessel ran aground off the coast of Wales, but both survived and were able to present their cases in early 1648. The States-General acted favorably upon their appeal and issued a writ of mandamus dated April 28 ordering Director-General Stuyvesant to appear in person, or through his representative, to sustain his judgment against them. Cornelis Melyn returned once again to New Amsterdam and caused the writ to be presented to Stuyvesant March 8, 1649, at a dramatic meeting in the New Amsterdam church. As Burton describes the confrontation: Melyn returned to the Netherlands in August 1649. Stuyvesant's representative, Cornelis van Tienhoven, the Secretary of the Colony, also proceeded aboard a different vessel. The case was apparently never brought to a hearing. Melyn returned in 1650 aboard the Nieuw Nederlandsche Fortuyn (New Netherland's Fortune) to resume his attempt to colonize Staten Island, along with a group of about 70 persons. His feud continued with Director-General Stuyvesant, who had him arrested and imprisoned without trial or hearing in 1655. During Melyn's imprisonment, there was another Indian uprising known as the Peach Tree War which destroyed the Staten Island colony. It was soon after this disaster that Cornelis Melyn and family left for the English New Haven Colony, where he took an oath of allegiance to the English crown April 7, 1657. In 1659, he agreed with the West India Company to relinquish his right of Patroonship of Staten Island. Death There is no record of Cornelis Melyn's death, but his name ceases to appear in the records of the New Haven colony after 1663 and is not mentioned in the records of the marriages of his two daughters in New Haven August 25, 1664. Melyn's role in history is recognized in a mural in the Staten Island Borough Hall by Frederick Charles Stahr entitled Cornelius Melyn Trades With the Indians.The Staten Island Historian - Borough Hall Murals ReferencesFurther reading  * External links * Genealogy of Cornelis Melyn, Patroon of Staten Island * Known Voyages of Cornelis Melyn Category:1600 births Category:1662 deaths Category:People of New Netherland Category:American people of Dutch descent Category:People from Antwerp ","title":"Cornelis Melyn"},{"id":"20852071","text":"Holy Cross Priory seen from south. Only parts of the original building remain in today's church. Dalby Church is a church, and a former Augustinian monastery located in Sk√•ne's old capital, Dalby, then Denmark, now southern Sweden.  History  The Holy Cross Abbey of Dalby began its story as a Viking Age royal manor (Danish: g√•rd). The buildings along with a granite chapel were donated for the establishment of a Benedictine monastery during the reign of King Sweyn II of Denmark, who gifted the old manor on which the abbey was to be built and two and a half other rented properties to fund its construction. The old manor buildings were converted into the ranges of the monastery. In 1066 Bishop Henrik of Lund died and Bishop Egino of Dalby Diocese took his place. Plans had been made to build a cathedral complex at Dalby, but the pope instead combined the dioceses of Dalby and Lund. In addition, Bishop Egino became the first Archbishop of Lund, after Pope Alexander II decided that Denmark and the rest of Scandinavia should from that time forward be an independent archdiocese of the Catholic Church. King Sweyn II's son, King Harald III of Denmark, was buried in the church at Dalby in 1080, indicating its important status at the end of the Viking Era. A new expanded church was built of granite in the Romanesque style as a basilica dedicated to St Peter and given over to Augustinian canons. The building was further extended in the early 13th century with the addition of double towers, an extended west facade and two smaller towers flanked the new apse added onto the choir. In the 14th century the abbey had become wealthy enough to rebuild itself, so the original Viking Age buildings were demolished and new larger brick buildings took their place. The church was nearly as large as Lund Cathedral when it was complete and was arranged in the typical plan for monasteries of the day. Three ranges were built adjacent to the church forming a four-sided enclosure to separate the canons from the world. At its height, Dalby owned 450 farms and other properties throughout Sk√•ne. Monks from Dalby founded the monastery at Tvilum on Jutland. The abbey was sacked by the Swedish King Charles Knutsson in 1450 and never fully recovered its status. As a result, the buildings were maintained, but not extended. In the 1530s Denmark fought over the question of religion. Lutherans urged Danes to abandon their Catholic beliefs, customs, and institutions in favor of those of the Lutheran movement. Dalby lost its support and rapidly declined. In 1536 Denmark became a Lutheran kingdom. All religious houses and their properties reverted to the crown. Dalby was secularized and given to the nobleman, Anders Bille and then other owners. Dalby suffered during the wars between Sweden and Denmark. It became the property of the Swedish Crown in 1678 when Sk√•ne became part of Sweden and in 1686 the eastern half of the church and towers were demolished. The buildings became so dilapidated by the 1740s that, while some parts were restored, other were demolished. In 1755 the entire eastern end of the church collapsed, destroying the famous marble altar. The partially ruined church was restored and a late Gothic brick tower added in 1758. The remaining range called \\"Boningshus\\" was repaired. It remains Sweden's oldest inhabited dwelling. In 1809 Dalby reverted to the Swedish Crown and it was restored again and modernized into the complex that can be seen today. Several additional buildings were constructed in the same style as the surviving buildings to replicate the feel of the ancient abbey. The parish church of Dalby is the oldest preserved church in Sweden and Scandinavia, thus also the oldest building in Scandinavia that is still in use. Its construction began around 1060. https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/8d9a39a7-31aa-4104-9255-ba83059c0caa  References  * Dalby Kungsgard Category:Augustinian monasteries in Sweden Category:1530s disestablishments in Sweden ","title":"Dalby Church"},{"id":"20852089","text":"Mas Que Alcanzar una estrella (Album) is the soundtrack to the film Mas Que Alcanzar una estrella.

Background  It is not known when Cui Sun was born. His family was from the \\"Elder Boling branch\\" of the prominent Cui clan of Bolin, although, as far as Cui Sun's branch was concerned, after Cui Sun's great-grandfather Cui Xinggong (Â¥îË°åÂäü), who served as the director of the Palace Library, his grandfather and father were said to have little reputation, and their names were not even recorded in the New Book of Tang's table of the chancellors' family trees.New Book of Tang, vol. 72 Old Book of Tang, vol. 136 .  Early career  Toward the end of Emperor Daizong's Dali era (766-779), Cui Sun passed the imperial examinations and was made a scribe at the archival bureau. He later served as the sheriff of Xianyang County (Âí∏ÈôΩ, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), within the capital municipality of Jingzhao (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ). However, later, because his maternal uncle Wang Hong (ÁéãÁøÉ) was the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality and thus could not properly serve as his superior, Cui was made a Dali Pingshi (Â§ßÁêÜË©ï‰∫ã), a judge at the supreme court (Â§ßÁêÜÂØ∫).Wang Hong became the mayor of Jingzhao in 782 and appeared to have left office in 783, and therefore Cui's movement should have been during those years. See Old Book of Tang, vols. 12 , 157 . He later became Bingbu Langzhong (ÂÖµÈÉ®ÈÉé‰∏≠), a supervisorial official at the ministry of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®, Bingbu). He later became You Jianyi Daifu (Âè≥Ë´´Ë≠∞Â§ßÂ§´), a high-level consultant at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng) in 795.  As chancellor  In 796, with the chancellor Zhao Jing having recently died and another chancellor, Lu Mai, seriously ill and unable to tend to affairs of state, Emperor Dezong made Cui Sun and Zhao Zongru chancellors with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã) ‚Äî in Cui's case, because he had been recommended by Emperor Dezong's close associate Pei Yanling, who had himself recently died as well.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 235. It was said that at the time, with two chancellors recently having died or been incapacitated, the people were hoping for virtuous chancellors, and with Cui not having had a good reputation, the people were disappointed. Further, it was said that after Cui became chancellor, he was not virtuous in his behavior, and was carefully avoiding to offend the emperor in any way, and therefore rarely spoke when Emperor Dezong met with the chancellors. In 798, Cui was made Menxia Shilang (ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng), and continued to serve as chancellor. That year, the funereal palace (i.e., a palace intended to be built for the spirit of the deceased emperor) at Emperor Taizong's tomb Zhaoling (Êò≠Èôµ) was destroyed in a wildfire. Emperor Dezong commissioned Cui to head the project to rebuild not only that funereal palace, but also at Xianling (ÁçªÈôµ, Emperor Gaozu's tomb), Qianling (Emperor Gaozong's tomb), Dingling (ÂÆöÈôµ, Emperor Zhongzong's tomb), Tailing (Ê≥∞Èôµ, Emperor Xuanzong's tomb), Qiaoling (Ê©ãÈôµ, Emperor Ruizong's tomb), and Yuanling (ÂÖÉÈôµ, Emperor Daizong's tomb), as well as repairs to the funereal palace at Jianling (Âª∫Èôµ, Emperor Suzong's tomb). Late in Cui's service as chancellor, he was often ill and staying at home. It was said that while he went through many important posts at both the legislative and examination bureaus and served as chancellor, he served without distinction. He was also criticized for not expanding the tomb of his mother and not attending the funeral of his older sister (who had become a Buddhist nun). It was further said that Emperor Dezong knew that the popular sentiment was that Cui was not a suitable chancellor, but because Cui served him carefully, he continued to favor Cui. Cui died in 803 and was given posthumous honors.  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 136. * New Book of Tang, vol. 167. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 235, 236.

It is endemic to the Sierra Nevada foothills of central California, where it is known from only a few scattered occurrences. It grows on barren patches of granite gravel in woodland and grasslands. It is a federally listed threatened species. Description It is a very small red-green annual plant radiating spreading stems a few centimeters long. There is a basal rosette of tiny, thick leaves. The inflorescence is a number of spherical clusters of rose-colored petals and thin sepals. The fruit is a tiny translucent capsule containing one or two seeds. Conservation In 2007, there were about 9 or 10 occurrences of the plant, with some occurrences made up of two or more small populations.USFWS. Mariposa Pussypaws Five-year Review. December 2007. The total population number varies year to year, generally because of the influence of local weather changes on the germination of seeds and the growth of seedlings. Past total population estimates varied from 1680 to nearly 3000 individuals.The Nature Conservancy Some populations are located on private land and have not been surveyed in many years. Others are quite variable in size, increasing from 58 to 770 individuals, or decreasing from hundreds of plants to only 3. A major threat to this species is habitat fragmentation; populations have been bisected by roads, dirtbike trails, and firebreaks. At least two populations are in the middle of residential subdivisions, or on the edges;USFWS.

Residential and commercial development continue to claim the habitat, as does the expansion of infrastructure to support the new development, including local services, utilities, and roads. Livestock are allowed to graze in some areas, but it is unknown if this affects the species. Since most of the populations are small, they are vulnerable to destruction from any one severe local event, such as drought or disease, and since the populations sometimes fall to very low numbers they are at risk for genetic bottlenecks and genetic drift.

Current StructureHistory As the 67th Infantry Brigade, the brigade was initially formed in August 1917 in the Iowa and Nebraska Army National Guards, and was part of the 34th Division mobilized for World War I.John J. McGrath, The Brigade: A History Its Organization and Employment in the US Army, Combat Studies Institute Press, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, 2004?, 169. It comprised the 133rd Infantry Regiment of Iowa and the 134th Infantry Regiment of Nebraska. It was demobilized on 18 February 1919 at Camp Grant, Illinois, but reconstituted in the National Guard in 1921, assigned to the 34th Division, and allotted to Iowa. The brigade controlled the 133rd and 168th Infantry Regiments. The Headquarters Company was organized at Winterset, Iowa and federally recognized on 20 July 1921. The Headquarters was organized at Council Bluffs, Iowa and federally recognized on 21 February 1922. The Headquarters changed station to Des Moines, Iowa, 23 August 1924, and to Sioux City, Iowa, 10 July 1940. The Headquarters Company changed station to Des Moines 2 July 1931 by reorganization and redesignation of the Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 168th Infantry Regiment. It was inducted into active federal service on 10 February 1941 and moved to Camp Claiborne, Louisiana. On 30 January 1941, the headquarters was disbanded and the Headquarters Company converted into the 34th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop (Mechanized). The lineage of this iteration of the 67th Infantry Brigade is not claimed by any unit in the state of Nebraska. From 1964 to 1985 it was the 67th Infantry Brigade. The brigade was organized under the Selected Reserve Force (SRF) program in the 1960s. The brigade consisted of (among other units) 1st Bn, 134th Infantry; 2nd Bn, 134th Infantry (later inactivated); 1st Battalion, 195th Armor (which joined in 1978); Troop E, 167th Cavalry; and Company D, 567th Engineers. This brigade was assigned as a \\"round out\\" brigade to the 4th Infantry Division. In the event of conflict the 67th Brigade would have come under the command of the 4th Infantry Division as one of its organic brigades. The 67th trained annually with the 4th Infantry Div. at Ft. Carson, CO. State ARNG newspapers reporting the recreation of the BfSB in 2008 say that the infantry brigade was reformed in 1962, with its main elements being the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 134th Infantry Regiment. Other combat units that were part of the brigade from the 1960s eventually included the 1st Battalion, 168th Field Artillery Regiment,Prairie Soldier, August 2008, 10 and Troop E, 167th Cavalry, which was constituted and assigned in 1964.

Construction was completed in 1953. The complex was occupied until 2006, it was famous for its residents' innovative form of tenant-led management. In 1976, Cochran Gardens became one of the first U.S. housing projects to have tenant management. Built by the same firm, Leinweber, Yamasaki & Hellmuth,http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/cx/?id=100775 as the infamous Pruitt‚ÄìIgoe complex, Cochran Gardens was more successful than its ill-fated sister project. In the mid 1970s, Bertha Gilkey and a group of friends successfully led a community driven rehabilitation effort; in 1976 she won a property management contract from the city. Independent management improved Cochran Gardens and created small business jobs in the neighborhood. President George H. W. Bush visited the site in 1991, commending tenant management and Bertha Gilkey. However, in 1998 city authorities took over Cochran Gardens, citing tax mismanagement by the tenant association. The buildings rapidly deteriorated, by 1999 vacancy rate increased from under 10% to one-third. Cochran Gardens, which survived into the 21st century, was demolished in 2008.

Creation The CAFGU was created on July 25, 1987 when President Corazon C. Aquino signed Executive Order No. 264 entitled \\"Providing for the Citizen Armed Force\\". The creation of the unit was based on the \\"clear, consolidate, hold and develop\\" strategy adopted by then-Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos in dealing with insurgent- infiltrated villages. CAFGU units are components of the AFP Ready Reserve detailed to Military Auxiliary Service. Article X, Sec. 61, sub-paragraph 2 of Republic Act 7077 describes this manner of service as follows: > Military auxiliary service entails services rendered in meeting local > insurgency threat. Reservists serving under this category will be organized > into Ready Reserve units. They must be issued and allowed to carry firearms: > Provided, That these reservists will be utilized only for the defense of > their respective localities and will not be employed outside their > localities. Elected/appointed local government officials are expected to > perform their duties and responsibilities in their respective peace and > order council levels or similar organizations efficiently and effectively to > enhance a total integrated system approach against threats to national > security. The Secretary of National Defense shall prescribe the rules and > regulations to implement this section in coordination with the Secretary of > the Interior and Local Government. Organization CAFGU units are administered by, and under the operational control of, regular units of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Philippine Army infantry battalions assigned to this function are also referred to as \\"Cadre Battalions\\". Deactivation of CAFGU units assigned to these battalions result in the return of their status as regular infantry battalions. The CAFGU units are tasked to prevent the re-infiltration of insurgents into communities that have already been cleared of their influence by combat operations conducted by regular units of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The CAFGU units are issued small arms; typically M1 Garand, M-14, or M-16 rifles, and receive a monthly stipend of Php 2,700.00 (about US$57). Criticism In 1993, the Philippine government considered deactivating the CAFGU units due to allegations of human rights abuses; 60 CAFGU units comprising 10,000 troops were disbanded. However, in 1996, the government halted its program to completely disband the CAFGU units. As of 2007, an estimated 60,000 CAFGU troopers are active in the country, taking part in military operations alongside regular soldiers of the AFP. The Commission on Human Rights' records show that as of 2000, 853 human rights abuse cases have been filed against 1,070 CAFGU members.

Equivalents is a series of photographs of clouds taken by Alfred Stieglitz from 1925 to 1934. They are generally recognized as the first photographs intended to free the subject matter from literal interpretation, and, as such, are some of the first completely abstract photographic works of art. Description Stieglitz took at least 220 photographs that he called Equivalent or Equivalents; all feature clouds in the sky. The majority of them show only the sky without any horizon, buildings or other objects in the frame, but a small number do include hills or trees. One series from 1927 prominently features poplar trees in the foreground. Almost all of the photographs are printed very darkly so the sky often appears black or nearly black. The contrast between the sky and the much lighter clouds is striking in all but a few of the prints. Some images include the sun either as a distinct element in the photograph or as an illuminating force behind the clouds. Background The multiple series Stieglitz called Equivalents combined two very important aspects of his photography: the technical and the aesthetic. He was a master at both, but with Equivalents he succeeded in bringing his skills to a new level. On the technical side, Stieglitz had been fascinated by the special problems of photographing clouds ever since the summer of 1887, when he took his first pictures of clouds over Lake Como in Italy. Until the 1920s most photographic emulsions were orthochromatic, which meant they were primarily sensitive to light on the blue end of the spectrum. This made photographing clouds particularly difficult because unless special filters were used the sky would appear very light and the clouds would be lost against it. Over the years Stieglitz repeatedly took photographs of clouds using orthochromatic emulsions, but he reported \\"Every time I developed [a cloud negative] I was so wrought up, always believing I had nearly gotten what I was after ‚Äì but had failed.\\" In 1922 Stieglitz read a commentary about his photography by Waldo Frank that suggested the strength of his imagery was in the power of the individuals he photographed. Stieglitz was outraged, believing Frank had at best ignored his many photographs of buildings and street scenes, and at worst had accused him of being a simple recorder of what appeared in front of him. He resolved immediately to begin a new series of cloud studies \\"to show that (the success of) my photographs (was) not due to subject matter ‚Äì not to special trees or faces, or interiors, to special privileges ‚Äì clouds were there for everyone‚Ä¶\\" He said \\"I wanted to photograph clouds to find out what I had learned in forty years about photography. Through clouds to put down my philosophy of life ‚Äì‚Ä¶My aim is increasingly to make my photographs look so much like photographs that unless one has eyes and sees, they won't be seen ‚Äì and still everyone will never forget them having once looked at them.\\" Coincidentally at this same time a new panchromatic photographic emulsion was developed that allowed the full range of colors to be captured. Soon after it became available Stieglitz aimed his 8\\" x 10\\" view camera at the sky and began taking pictures. By the next year he had created a series of ten mounted photographs he called Music: A Sequence of Ten Cloud Photographs (also called Clouds in Ten Movements). He told his wife Georgia O'Keeffe \\"I wanted a series that when seen by Ernest Bloch (the great composer) he would exclaim: Music! Music! Man, why that is music! How did you ever do that? And he would point to violins and flutes, and oboes, and brass‚Ä¶\\" He first exhibited this series in 1923 in his one-man show at the Anderson Galleries in New York, and reported that when Bloch saw them there he had exactly the reaction Stieglitz had wanted. Encouraged by the success of the Music series he took his smaller 4\\" x 5\\" Graflex camera and shot dozens of pictures of the sky in the summer of 1923. He arranged many of these photographs into distinct series he called Songs of the Sky. In late 1924 he exhibited sixty-one of his cloud photos in a single room at the Anderson Galleries. In the catalog to the exhibition he wrote \\"Songs of the Sky ‚Äì Secrets of the Skies as revealed by my Camera are tiny photographs, direct revelations of a man's world in the sky ‚Äì documents of eternal relationship ‚Äì perhaps even a philosophy.\\" After seeing the exhibition, Ananda Coomaraswamy, who was then curator at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, persuaded Stieglitz to donate some of his photographs, including five from Songs of the Sky, to the museum. This was the first time a major museum in the U.S. acquired photographs as part of its permanent collection. Stieglitz continued photographing clouds and skies for most of the next decade. In 1925 he began referring to these photographs as Equivalents, a name he used for all such photographs taken from that year forward. In 1929 he renamed some of the original Songs of the Sky as Equivalents, and these prints are still known by both names today. Dorothy Norman once recorded a conversation between Stieglitz and a man looking at one of his Equivalents prints: > Man (looking at a Stieglitz Equivalent): Is this a photograph of water? > Stieglitz: What difference does it make of what it is a photograph? Man: But > is it a photograph of water? Stieglitz: I tell you it does not matter. Man: > Well, then, is it a picture of the sky? Stieglitz: It happens to be a > picture of the sky. But I cannot understand why that is of any importance. Stieglitz certainly knew what he had achieved in these pictures. Writing about his Equivalents to Hart Crane, he declared: \\"I know exactly what I have photographed. I know I have done something that has never been done‚Ä¶I also know that there is more of the really abstract in some 'representation' than in most of the dead representations of the so-called abstract so fashionable now.\\" Artistic importance The Equivalents are sometimes recognized as the first intentionally abstract photographs, although this claim may be difficult to uphold given Alvin Langdon Coburn's Vortographs that were created almost a decade earlier. Nonetheless, it is difficult to look at them today and understand the impact that they had at the time. When they first appeared photography had been generally recognized as a distinct art form for no more than fifteen years, and until Stieglitz introduced his cloud photos there was no tradition of photographing something that was not recognizable in both form and content. Art critic Hilton Kramer said that Equivalents \\"undoubtedly owe something to the American modernist painting (Dove's and O'Keeffe's especially) that Stieglitz felt particularly close to at the time. Yet they go distinctly beyond the pictorial conventions that governed avant-garde painting in this period by reaching for the kind of lyric abstraction that was not to enter American painting until the 1940s and 1950s. In the line that can be traced from the paintings of Albert Pinkham Ryder to, say, those of Clyfford Still, it is in Stieglitz's Equivalents ‚Äì rather than in painting itself ‚Äì that we find the strongest link.\\" One of the reasons that the strongest of these photographs appear so abstract is that they are void of any reference points. Stieglitz was not concerned with a particular orientation for many of these prints, and he was known to exhibit them sideways or upside down from how he originally mounted them. Photography historian Sarah Greenough points out that by doing so Stieglitz \\"was destabilizing your [the viewer's] relationship with nature in order to have you think less about nature, not to deny that it's a photograph of a cloud, but to think more about the feeling that the cloud formation evokes.\\" She further says: :\\"The Equivalents are photographs of shapes that have ceded their identity, in which Stieglitz obliterated all references to reality normally found in a photograph. There is no internal evidence to locate these works either in time or place. They could have been taken anywhere‚Äînothing indicates whether they were made in Lake George, New York City, Venice, or the Alps‚Äîand, except for the modern look of the gelatin silver prints, they could have been made at any time since the invention of photography. And because there is no horizon line in these photographs, it is not even clear which way is 'up' and which way 'down.' Our confusion in determining a 'top' and a 'bottom' to these photographs, and our inability to locate them in either time or place, forces us to read what we know are photographs of clouds as photographs of abstracted forms.\\" New York Times art critic Andy Grundberg said The Equivalents \\"remain photography's most radical demonstration of faith in the existence of a reality behind and beyond that offered by the world of appearances. They are intended to function evocatively, like music, and they express a desire to leave behind the physical world, a desire symbolized by the virtual absence of horizon and scale clues within the frame. Emotion resides solely in form, they assert, not in the specifics of time and place.\\" Photographer Ansel Adams said Stieglitz's work had a profound influence on him. In 1948 he claimed his first \\"intense experience in photography\\" was seeing many of the Equivalents (probably for the first time in 1933, when they met). Series and sets Stieglitz arranged the photographs he called Equivalent into several different groups when he exhibited or published them, and often he inscribed the mounted prints on the back with one or more letters to further identify what he called \\"sets\\". These groupings are not sequential, and Stieglitz did not consider any single series or set as a discrete unit. Some of the individual prints are included in more than one series or set, and some copies of the same print are inscribed with different identifications. In general, his sets should be seen as \\"totally artificial constructions which mirror, not the passage of real time, but the change and flux of Stieglitz‚Äôs subjective state.\\" The following is a chronological listing of the Equivalents photographs. Many of the prints do not have individual titles, and dozens of photographs are known by the same generic name Equivalent. The most comprehensive catalog of these photographs is found in Alfred Stieglitz: The Key Set., and the numbers in this list refer to the photographs identified in that publication. *1923 ‚Äì Songs of the Sky \\"W\\" / Equivalent \\"W\\" ‚Äì two prints (Key Set #950-951).

It was established on June 22, 1963 by Republic Act 3591. It guarantees deposits up to P500,000.\\"GMA signs law raising deposit insurance to P.5 million\\" Primary Functions of PDIC is to protect the small investors/depositors and to build a strong banking confidence. History On June 22, 1963, PDIC was created through Republic Act 359, which provided: # Deposit insurance cover for banks. # Maximum deposit insurance of P 10,000 per depositor. # Maximum assessment rate of 1/12 of 1% assessable deposits per annum. # Voluntary insurance membership with PDIC. # Permanent insurance fundmat 5 million pesos. # Formation of a 3-member Board of Directors. In 1969, Membership to PDIC became compulsory for all banks through Republic Act 6037. In 1970, PDIC started collecting maximum assessment rate of 1/18 of 1% of net assessable deposits per annum. On the same year, First payout was given to the Rural Bank of Nabua authorized by the Board. On July 6, 1970, Initially one claim agent was assigned to handle the payout, although a transfer deposit scheme with the Rural Bank of Rinconada was later arranged facilitate claims payment. Then 1978 the maximum deposit insurance coverage was increased to 15,000 pesos per depositor according to Presidential Decree 1451. In 1984 the following reform take place in the PDIC: 1.Maximum deposit insurance coverage was increased to P40,000 per depositor (Presidential Decree 1897). 2.Under Presidential Decree 1940, the following reforms were undertaken: a.)PDIC made a preferred creditor over unsecured creditors b.)Trust accounts excluded from insurance coverage c.)Minimum assessment premium paid by banks set at P250 In 1988 the World Bank report on strengthening the financial sector was completed and recommended a greater role for PDIC in the supervisory/examination of banks and in handling distressed banks. The World Bank recommended PDIC to be appointed mandatory receiver and liquidator of closed banks, and its financial and manpower resources reinforced. As a result, PDIC drafted the Institutional Strengthening Program laying the groundwork for an institutional/organizational restructuring to cope with the expanded function; setting of upgraded standards, hiring procedures and intensive training programs; and innovations in systems and procedures with emphasis on computerization and automation. Later 1989 Liquidity pools were set up to contribute to the stability in the rural banking system by immediately addressing temporary liquidity requirements of rural banks. Under this scheme, rural banks contributed a portion of their liquid assets which Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) matched. The funds were invested in high-yielding, risk- free government securities, which can be availed of by member rural banks in the event of liquidity crisis. Further, PDIC maintained a credit line in case more funds are needed. After four years, there were already 27 liquidity pools created composed of 429 rural banks. Following year PDIC joined a World Bank mission, with then Central Bank and Land Bank of the Philippines, that created the Countryside Financial Institutions Enhancement Program (CFIEP) aimed at transforming rural banks into formidable agents of countryside development. The program helped rural banks to reduce burden of debt to CB, raise capital, attain economies of scale and become more competitive in the banking system. CFIEP Module 1 provided for infusion of fresh equity from existing stockholders and new investors.

The facility allows the PDIC President to approve payment of the actual amount of claims or P5,000, whichever is lower, even before the official start of the claims settlement operations in a closed bank. Said amount was subsequently increased up to the MDIC of P100,000. In the year 2004 the institution make amendments for the aim to protect depositors from loss.

In the film he is portrayed by actor Michael Madsen. Early life Little is known about Naturile's background except for criminal acts he committed and that he lived in Manhattan, in the same neighborhood as John Wojtowicz. As a child growing up in Keansburg, New Jersey, Naturile had been picked up and arrested on many charges of truancy, grand larceny, burglary and dangerous drugs. He spent most of his teen years in and out of state reform schools, and as a youth while incarcerated in prison, he was victim to numerous acts of sodomy from older, stronger inmates. Within the three months before the fatal robbery attempt, Naturile had been charged with possession of burglary tools and possession of narcotics. In his novelization of the crime, Patrick Mann suggests that Naturile had connections with the Italian mafia in New York City, but he had no known associations with organized crime. Naturile sported a faint blond mustache, and crude tattoos on his arms and thighs, and lived mostly as a drifter, but a New York Times article stated that he remained in contact with and occasionally lived with his mother. The robbery Vega and Eddie Cabot, ideologist of theft first met at Danny's, a gay bar on Seventh Avenue South in lower Manhattan, where Wojtowicz initially claimed that a bank executive from Chase Manhattan had suggested they rob the bank. On August 22, 1972, Naturile and two accomplices attempted to rob a branch of the Chase Manhattan bank at 450 Avenue P in Gravesend, Brooklyn; the robbery was led by John Wojtowicz and Robert Westenberg. The robbers entered the bank armed with a .38 caliber handgun and carrying a box which contained a shotgun and a rifle; all three weapons were purchased by Wojtowicz. Westenberg was to provide the demand note to the bank manager but, unnerved by a police car on the street, fled the scene before the robbery was announced. Wojtowicz and Naturile then held seven Chase Manhattan bank employees hostage for 14 hours. Wojtowicz, a former bank teller, had some knowledge of bank operations and drew inspiration from scenes of The Godfather (1972), which he had seen earlier that day. The note they passed to the cashier read: \\"This is an offer you can't refuse.\\" Before the robbery, Naturile had informed Wojtowicz and Westenberg that he would rather die than go back to prison. He was seen by the police on the scene as being nervous, highly strung, and volatile. The police feared that increasing the pressure placed on Naturile and Wojtowicz would cause them to become frightened, unbalanced, and impossible to negotiate with on reasonable terms. During the robbery, Naturile was dressed in a black business suit and tie, and carried an attach√© case. His last meal consisted of takeout pizza and soda pop, which he consumed during the holdout at the bank with the hostages. The robbery was meant to fund the sex reassignment operation of Wojtowicz's trans wife, Elizabeth Eden. Naturile's share was to finance his two sisters' removal from foster care and separation from their mother, who drank and neglected all three of her children. =The standoff with police= During the robbery, Naturile surveyed the street and alleyway, realizing the robbers were surrounded by police. It was later reported by the bank manager and tellers he had held hostage that he spoke often of the tremendous power of the .30-06 rifle and his ability and willingness to use it. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and New York City Police Department (NYPD) feared Naturile during the hostage situation more than the more stable Wojtowicz. Naturile was the only one of the robbers who had a previous criminal record and was known by the police. Wojtowicz fired a single shot at the police through the Chase Manhattan bank's exit rear door, fearing the police were preparing to storm the building. Only one other shot was fired during the standoff: when the rifle used by Wojtowicz accidentally discharged when it was dropped on the floor. =Assuming the Donald Matterson identity= Wojtowicz identified Naturile to police by his criminal alias, \\"Donald Matterson\\". Naturile had used the alias when he was arrested for possession of narcotics and burglary tools five months before the bank robbery. Consequently, for two hours, local television stations, live at the scene, reported that the two suspects were Wojtowicz and Donald Matterson. It was not until later the latter was officially identified as Salvatore Naturile, who had charges pending against him for his arrest in Manhattan for possession of burglary tools, after having been released on parole. =Ambush and death= When entering the limo to be chauffeured to the John F. Kennedy International Airport in South Ozone Park, Queens, along with the hostages, Wojtowicz told Naturile to sit with bank employee Shirley Ball and one of her co-workers in the third row, while the others sat in the fourth, reserving the fifth row for himself and the two remaining hostages. There was a .38 caliber handgun hidden in the front seat of the limousine that Wojtowicz missed when searching the vehicle upon its first arriving at the bank. FBI Special Agent Fred Fehl positioned himself on the driver's side of the limo next to the open window closest to Naturile, who sat between two hostages in the third row. FBI Special Agent Dick Baker took up a position on the right side of the car closest to Wojtowicz, who was still situated in the rear seat. NYPD Police Chief of Detectives Louis C. Cottell, who headed the negotiations during the initial standoff, stayed 15 feet away from the rear of the limo. When everyone prepared for the final standoff, the \\"getaway\\" Hansa Jet rolled out onto the tarmac where they sat in the limo. Baker asked the agent posing as the limousine driver, identified only as \\"Murphy\\", to ask whether the group wanted any food on the flight. Agent \\"Murphy\\" took advantage of this opportunity to assess the threat Naturile and Wojtowicz posed from where they were situated in the vehicle as he turned to ask them the trigger question. Baker responded with one word, \\"Yes,\\" which was \\"Murphy's\\" cue to act. Agent \\"Murphy\\" grabbed the handgun with his left hand and ordered the two men to \\"freeze.\\" Simultaneously, Agent Fehl and the driver wrestled with the barrel of Naturile's shotgun, knocking it toward the ceiling. Agent \\"Murphy\\" shot Naturile in the chest at close range. Naturile slumped in the seat, mortally wounded. Agent Baker secured the rifle lying across Wojtowicz's lap. Wojtowicz surrendered without further incident. Naturile was rushed to the hospital by an ambulance that was waiting at the scene but was pronounced dead on arrival. A middle-aged man named Wallace Hamilton, who told reporters he was a friend of Naturile's, identified Naturile's corpse at the city morgue following the robbery. Dog Day Afternoon Salvatore Naturile's story was used as the basis for the film Dog Day Afternoon. (released in 1975), starring Al Pacino as Wojtowicz (called \\"Sonny Wortzik\\" in the film) and John Cazale, Pacino's co-star in The Godfather (1972), as Naturile. In 1975, Wojtowicz wrote a letter to The New York Times expressing concern that people would believe the movie version of the events, which he said was only 30% accurate. Among other objections, he stated that the movie intimated that he had \\"sold out\\" Naturile to the police, which he claims was untrue. Several attempts were made on Wojtowicz's life following an inmate screening of the movie. Wojtowicz would later, however, praise Al Pacino's portrayal of himself and Chris Sarandon's of his wife Elizabeth Eden as accurate. In a 2006 interview, the movie's screenwriter, Frank Pierson, said he had tried to visit Wojtowicz in prison many times while writing the screenplay, to get more details about his story, but Wojtowicz refused each time to see him because Wojtowicz thought he was not paid enough money for the rights to his story. An 18-year-old actor was originally to be cast in the role of Naturile, but actor John Cazale, who was 39 years old at the time of production, ultimately got the part.

Robertson (April 12, 1934 ‚Äì August 24, 2017) was an American Democratic politician who served as mayor of York, Pennsylvania from 1994 to January 2002. In May 2001, Robertson was charged for a murder during the York race riots in July 1969, but was acquitted in October 2002. BiographyEarly life and education= Born and raised in York, Robertson was the youngest of six boys to his parents Milford (Hap, a school janitor) and Margretta. When Robertson was 15, his father was robbed and beaten by three black men while walking home from work, to which he attributes his early views regarding race. He graduated in 1952 from William Penn Senior High School in York and spent two years as a medic in the United States Army. Robertson began a 29-year career with the York Police Department in 1962. He regularly mentored children, and parents trusted him, which greatly helped his later involvement in politics. =Political career= Robertson was elected to the school board in 1975. He first ran for mayor in 1993, and was re-elected in 1997. He was running for a third term in 2001, and had won a tight race (by 48 votes) in the Democratic primary against city councilman Ray Crenshaw only two days before legal charges were brought and Robertson was arrested and put in handcuffs. Crenshaw was the first black man to have run for mayor of York. Tom Wolf, who would become governor of Pennsylvania in 2015, was Robertson's campaign chairman. Robertson did not want to withdraw from the election, though his closest political supporters convinced him to do so \\"for the betterment of York\\". Fellow Democrat John S. Brenner was ultimately elected as the next mayor. =Race riot involvement and trial= Due to its decades-later media coverage, Robertson is most known for his role in the 1969 York Race Riot, while serving as a police officer. He helped to incite the violence by shouting, \\"White power!\\" and by allegedly giving white rioters ammunition and encouraging them to, \\"kill as many niggers as [they] can.\\" He was arrested on May 17, 2001, and released on $50,000 bail. On May 27, 2001, Robertson was arraigned on murder charges stemming from his involvement in the riot; he was found not guilty on October 19, 2002. While he admitted that he had shouted the racial slur (calling it \\"a youthful incident of ingrained police racism\\"), he steadfastly denied all other charges against him and refused to step down while mayor. Robertson died on August 24, 2017 at Manor Care South in York, Pennsylvania at the age of 83, after being diagnosed with cancer about two years earlier.

Dorr was born in Hartford, Vermont. His earliest inclinations were for a seafaring life and when only ten years of age he sailed from Newburyport as a boy before the mast. In 1838, Dorr settled in Buffalo, New York, and became a sailor on the Great Lakes, serving as captain of several vessels. In 1843, Dorr became marine inspector for the Buffalo Mutual Insurance Company, and acted as agent of the New York board of underwriters for \\"the entire northwest\\" (the Great Lakes region). He was also for some time the Buffalo representative of many insurance companies, and served for seven years as president of the Board of Inland Underwriters. He was the first to organize a regular system of wreckage on the Great Lakes, and did much to improve the condition of seamen and to obtain recognition of their acts of heroism. Dorr was also a leader in Buffalo's business community. He acted at different times as president of the Board of Trade, the Society of Fine Arts, and the Historical Society of Buffalo, and as vice-president of the National Board of Trade. When the idea of systematic weather reporting was first suggested, Dorr took up the duty.

In English-language sources the name is often spelled Goering. Born the year before the outbreak of the Second World War, Edda spent most of her early childhood years with her mother at the G√∂ring family estate at Carinhall. As a child she received many historical works of art as gifts, including a painting of the Madonna and Child by Lucas Cranach the Elder. In the final stages of the war, she and her mother moved to their mountain home at Obersalzberg, near Berchtesgaden. After the war, she went to a girls-only school, studied at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, and became a law clerk. In the 1950s and 1960s many of the valuable gifts she received as a child, including the Madonna and Child painting, became the subject of long legal battles, most of which she eventually lost in 1968. Unlike the children of other high-ranking Nazis, such as Gudrun Himmler and Albert Speer Jr., G√∂ring did not speak in public about her father's career. However, in 1986 she was interviewed for Swedish television and spoke lovingly of both her parents.Interview mit Edda G√∂ring (in German) at YouTube BiographyBirth= The only child of Hermann G√∂ring, Edda was born on 2 June 1938. Her father received approximately 628,000 messages of congratulations on his daughter's birth; tributes came in from all over the world, including telegrams from British Lords Halifax and Londonderry. The historian Giles MacDonogh later described the German reaction to the birth: It has often been suggested that the name Edda was given in honour of the daughter of Benito Mussolini, but her mother stated that this was not so. On 4 November 1938, she was baptised at Carinhall, and Adolf Hitler became her godfather. The occasion was reported by Life, with many photographs of Edda, her parents and Hitler, who greatly enjoyed the event. Her baptism presents included two paintings by Lucas Cranach the Elder. To the displeasure of Heinrich Himmler, it was discovered that neither Emmy nor Edda's nanny was a Nazi Party member, but this was soon corrected when G√∂ring arranged for Emmy to join the party. On Hitler's instructions, she received the Golden Party Badge, a rare award originally reserved for founding members, long-term supporters, or people who had shown outstanding service to the party. =Early years= Edda grew up at Carinhall and like other daughters of high-ranking Nazi leaders and officials she was called Kleine Prinzessin (\\"Little Princess\\"). When she was one year old, the journalist Douglas Reed wrote in Life that she was \\"a sort of Nazi Crown Princess.\\" In 1940, the Luftwaffe paid for a small-scale replica of Frederick the Great's palace of Sanssouci to be built in an orchard at Carinhall for her to play in. Some 50 metres long, 7 metres wide, and 3¬Ω metres high, this had within it a miniature theatre, complete with stage and curtains, and was known as Edda-Schl√∂sschen (\\"Edda's little palace\\"). In 1940, Der St√ºrmer magazine printed a story alleging that Edda had been conceived by artificial insemination. A furious G√∂ring demanded action by Walter Buch, the supreme Nazi Party regulator, against the editor, Julius Streicher. Buch declared he was ready to \\"stop that sick mind once and for all,\\" but Hitler intervened to save Streicher and the outcome was that he was stripped of some honors, but was allowed to go on publishing Der St√ºrmer from his farm near Nuremberg. =1945 and after= During the closing stages of the Second World War in Europe, G√∂ring retreated to his mountain home at Obersalzberg, near Berchtesgaden, taking Emmy and Edda with him. On 8 May 1945, Armistice in Europe Day, The German Wehrmacht surrendered unconditionally, and on 21 May, a few days before her seventh birthday, Edda was interned with her mother in the U.S.-controlled Palace Hotel, code-named Camp Ashcan at Mondorf in Luxembourg. By 1946, the two had been freed and were living at one of their own houses, Burg Veldenstein, in Neuhaus, near Nuremberg. There they were visited by the American officer John E. Dolibois, who described Edda as \\"a beautiful child, the image of her father. Bright and perky, polite and well-trained.\\" During the Nuremberg trials, Edda was allowed to visit her father in prison. He was found guilty of war crimes and was sentenced to death, but on 15 October 1946, the night before his scheduled execution, G√∂ring committed suicide by swallowing a cyanide pill. By April 1946, Emmy and Edda G√∂ring were living in a small house at Sackdilling.Anna Rosmus Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 291f In 1948, while living near Hersbruck with her mother and her aunt Else Sonnemann, Edda entered the St Anna-M√§dchenoberrealschule (\\"Saint Anne's High School for Girls\\") at Sulzbach-Rosenberg in Bavaria where she remained until gaining her Abitur. In November 1948, the family moved to Etzelwang to be nearer the school. In 1949, Emmy faced legal problems regarding some valuable possessions and explained many of them as the property of Edda, now aged ten. After leaving school, Edda studied law at the University of Munich and became a law clerk; she later worked for a doctor. A private letter from an unknown relative in 1959 stated that \\"the baby is now a young lady, slim, fair-haired and pretty. She lives with her mother on the 5th floor of a modern apartment block in the Munich city centre.\\" =Later life= Edda G√∂ring, left In her later years, Edda worked in a hospital laboratory and was hoping to become a medical technician. She was a regular guest of Hitler's patron Winifred Wagner whose grandson, Gottfried Wagner, later recalled: Edda worked in a rehabilitation clinic in Wiesbaden and devoted herself to taking care of her mother, remaining with her until she died on 8 June 1973. After that, for five years in the 1970s, Edda was the companion of the Stern magazine journalist Gerd Heidemann. Heidemann had bought the yacht Carin II, which had been Hermann G√∂ring's, and according to Peter Wyden \\"He charmed Edda, pretty, not married, and devoted to the memory of her father, the Reichsmarschall, and started an affair with her. Together, they ran social events aboard the boat. Much of the talk was of Hitler and the Nazis, and the guests of honor were weathered eyewitnesses of the hallowed time, two generals, Karl Wolff and Wilhelm Mohnke.\\" For some years Edda made public appearances, attending memorials for Nazis and taking part in political events, but she later became more withdrawn. Unlike the children of other high-ranking Nazis, such as Gudrun Himmler and Albert Speer, Jr., she never commented publicly on her father's role in the Third Reich or the Holocaust. In the 1990s, she said of her father in an interview: In 2010, Edda said of her uncle Albert G√∂ring for an article in The Guardian, \\"He could certainly help people in need himself financially and with his personal influence, but, as soon as it was necessary to involve higher authority or officials, then he had to have the support of my father, which he did get.\\" The governments of West Germany and the reunited Germany denied Edda G√∂ring the pension normally given to the children of government ministers of the old German Reich. As of 2015, she was reported to be still living in Munich. In that year, she unsuccessfully petitioned the Landtag of Bavaria for compensation with respect to the expropriation of her father's legacy. A committee unanimously denied her request. She died on 21 December 2018 and was buried at an undisclosed location in the Munich Waldfriedhof. Legal dispute over Cranach Madonna At the time of her baptism in November 1938, Edda received several works of art as gifts, including a painting of the Madonna and Child by Lucas Cranach the Elder, a present from the City of Cologne. Part of an official collection entrusted to the office of the Oberb√ºrgermeister (or Lord Mayor), the painting had been previously on display in the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne. The mayor at the time, Karl Georg Schmidt (de) had been a member of the Nazi party since 1923 and was a political ally of Hermann G√∂ring. After the war, the City of Cologne sought the return of the painting, on the grounds that the gifts had been unwillingly given to Edda under pressure from G√∂ring. Advocate- General Philipp Auerbach (de), state commissioner for racial, religious and political persecution in Bavaria, was entrusted with the return of many art treasures that had been acquired by the G√∂rings, and the legal battle over the Cranach Madonna lasted for 15 years. At the first hearing, in the regional court of Cologne, judgment was given for the city. Edda, who at the time was studying law, appealed this decision to the Higher Regional Court of Cologne, which in 1954 overturned the lower court. Historian Anna Sigmund reports that the appeal court \\"came to the conclusion that [Hermann] G√∂ring had not exerted any pressure\\" and \\"on the contrary\\" the mayor of the day (Schmidt) had \\"tried to curry favor for the city of Cologne by giving away the Cranach painting\\". This was Edda G√∂ring's second legal victory of 1954. She had already been successful in forcing the state of Bavaria to return to her jewellery valued at 150,000 Deutschmarks which it had seized. The authorities continued to pursue the case of the Cranach painting, and in January 1968 the Federal Court of Justice of Germany in Karlsruhe gave a final judgment in favour of the City of Cologne. By that point, both the state of Bavaria and the Federal Republic of Germany had laid claim to the painting, which was returned to the Wallraf- Richartz-Museum. In popular culture Edda G√∂ring appears as a character in the television miniseries Nuremberg. In the 1991 comedy-drama Selling Hitler she was played by Alison Steadman.

The American Red Cross says the warning is issued when \\"chemical, biological, or radiological contaminants may be released accidentally or intentionally into the environment\\" and residents should \\"select a small, interior room, with no or few windows, taking refuge there.\\" Radiological and chemical defense Shelter in place in radiological and chemical defense scenarios entails closing all household doors, windows, and vents and taking immediate shelter in a readily accessible location that puts as much indoor air and radiation shielding-mass between the individual and the hazardous outside air, such as a basement or centrally located medium to small room, and trying to make it as airtight as possible by shutting off all ventilation/HVAC systems and extensively sealing the shelter's doors and windows from all outside air contaminants with damp towels, or if available, plastic sheeting and adhesive tape. Diagrams of what sheltering in place entails following a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) threat, and how long it is advised to be done for, is provided by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency- affiliated website Ready.gov. Shelter-in-place effectiveness has been evaluated and experimental results show that proper sealing can make a substantial difference to a normal home shelter, finding it to be at least twice as effective against a host of airborne substances when compared against simply staying inside and not implementing the countermeasure, and in most airborne contaminant cases, it is usually much more effective, depending on the particle size of the substance in question. If the occupant's breathing is the only consumer of oxygen and producer of carbon dioxide in the room, then carbon dioxide levels would not begin to reach dangerous values until 3+ hours had passed, in most likely, 4-person home scenarios. In the military, \\"Shelter-in-Place\\" is comparable to \\"buttoning up\\" and has proved life-saving in certain nuclear fallout instances. accessed Feb 20, 2013 The danger of radiation from radioactive precipitation/\\"fallout\\" decreases with time, as radioactivity decays exponentially with time, such that for each factor of seven increase in time, the radiation is reduced by a factor of ten. Creating the following 7-10 rule-of-thumb after a typical nuclear detonation while under the conditions that all fallout that will fall on the land has done so completely and no further deposition in the area will occur - After 7 hours, the average dose rate outside is reduced by a factor of ten; after 49(7x7) hours, it is reduced by a further factor of ten (to a value of 1/100th of the initial dose rate); after two weeks the radiation from the fallout will have reduced by a factor of 1000 compared to the initial level; and after 14 weeks the average dose rate will have reduced to 1/10,000th of the initial level. If an individual finds themselves outside during an emergency that calls for shelter-in-place, then effective but low-tech decontamination is required before entering into the shelter. Other usesShooting and bombing incidents= The phrase \\"Shelter-in-place\\" has also erroneously been used, instead of the more accurate lockdown, to describe precautions to be taken by the public when violence has occurred or might occur (particularly in shootings) in the area and the perpetrator is believed to still be in the area but not apprehended. The public in the area is advised to carry out all the same tasks as a typical shelter-in-place but without the key step of sealing the shelter up to prevent outside air from circulating indoors, in this scenario people are simply urged to lockdown ‚Äî stay indoors and \\"close, lock and stay away from external doors and windows.\\" In light of active shooter events and the panic that can ensue, a lockdown alert issued as \\"shelter in place,\\" can also be implemented as a response to armed events, such as the 2014 Fort Hood shooting. Similarly a lockdown alert was likewise issued as a \\"Shelter-in-place\\" alert by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency over the cell phone Wireless Emergency Alerts service for local residents during the manhunt for the Boston Marathon bombing suspects.\\"Boston Bombing Shows How Wireless Emergency Alerts Can Work with Other Media\\" =Epidemic incidents= During an epidemic or pandemic with an infectious agent posing significant risk of death or severe illness such as ebola or SARS, authorities may recommend \\"Shelter in Place\\" for the general population or for segments of the population at high-risk. Unlike other \\"Shelter in Place\\" incidents, recommendations may only be for particular at-risk populations (e.g., the elderly, the immunocompromised) and the recommended duration may be for an extended period of time (days, weeks or months). Shelter in Place may be implemented as a strategy for suppressing or mitigating an epidemic, for reducing numbers of critically ill patients presenting at the same time and for thus reducing the impact of critical illness on health care systems and reducing the likelihood that a surge in illness will overwhelm critical care resources. Shelter in Place may apply specifically to individuals or groups judged to be at-risk for death or serious complications if infected, and contrasts with Self-Isolation (voluntarily seclusion at home to prevent infecting others) and Quarantine (voluntary or involuntary seclusion of individuals exposed to infection for a period to determine infection status). Shelter in Place over extended periods in epidemics may involve significant logistical considerations including measures to safely provide food, medication and other supplies over time as well as arrangements for social and psychological support. When the term shelter-in-place order was used by the authorities in the United States in responding to the outbreaks of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2020, people were not familiar with it as the term had been used in other emergency situations such as an active shooter which would require seeking a safe place to hide within the same building that the person already occupies until the situation is resolved. This caused confusion to the residents under the order on exactly what they were supposed to do. Later, the State of California used the term stay-at-home order instead. Other US states started using the new term when they announced their statewide order. Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York criticized anyone using the term shelter in place for his stay-at-home order as it would invoke panic due to its association with active shooting situations or nuclear wars. Implementation Residents of an affected community might be informed that shelter in place is being implemented through the news media, Emergency Alert System, Reverse 911, warning sirens or horns, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather reports, and announcements from vehicles equipped with public address systems. In the United States, facilities like nuclear power plants are required to be equipped with audio alert systems that can be heard within a radius. Once a shelter in place is called, residents are expected to immediately go indoors, bring all children and animals with them, and to close and lock windows and doors. All ways in which outside materials may enter the shelter area should be eliminated, including closure of fireplace dampers, shutting off ventilation or climate control systems, and prepare an area for pets to eliminate waste that does not require allowing them outside. If told to do so via television or radio, those sheltering should seal their rooms with duct tape and plastic. Upon reaching shelter, those who were outside for a period of time seeking shelter after the shelter in place was called and who may have been exposed to chemical contaminants should remove all outer clothing, put it in a plastic bag, and wash with warm water. After an announcement that the shelter in place is over, residents should go outside and open all doors and windows to ventilate the shelter. Similar processes should be followed in cars, workplaces, or schools.  Cases  * In October 2009, authorities called a shelter in place in Contra Costa County, California, after a teenager committed suicide by mixing chemicals together. Three nearby residents who were affected by the fumes were treated at a hospital, and the shelter in place order was lifted after three hours. * On August 6, 2012, a shelter in place warning was issued in Richmond, California, due to a refinery fire at the Chevron Richmond Refinery.Kristin J. Bender and Daniel M. Jimenez, \\"Massive fire at Chevron refinery in Richmond fully contained; shelter in place lifted\\", Contra Costa Times (August 6, 2012). * On October 29, 2012, a shelter in place warning was issued in Louisville, Kentucky, after a train carrying hazardous chemicals was derailed near Dixie Highway and Katherine Station. * On March 16, 2020, a shelter in place warning was issued in San Francisco, California and the surrounding Bay Area, to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in California. The order was the first in California and soon thereafter other states in the United States, as well as many areas in countries throughout the world, gave shelter in place orders. The San Francisco Bay Area's shelter in place order was seen as a proactive measure that had a significant effect with 'flattening the curve' of the outbreak in the area. California, and Washington State, who also gave early warnings, were viewed as important bellwethers for modeling the spread of the virus if strict social distancing, non-essential business shutdowns, and stay at home orders were in effect.https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/04/01/lockdown-coronavirus- california-data/ Example of a shelter in place warning A public safety alert sent by Santa Clara County about the shelter in place order.

Biography  Biographies. Songonlyrics.com. Retrieved on 2016-01-17.Evan Winiker. allmusic.com Over the years he has managed Thirty Seconds To Mars, Jared Leto, Nicky Romero, Sky Ferreira, MAX, Daya, The Disco Biscuits and Walk off the Earth at Full Stop Management. Early life and music career He was born on December 22, 1982 in New York, NY. His family moved to New Jersey in his early teens where he met Jack Antonoff at the Solomon Schecter Day School of Bergen County. At the time, Antonoff was part of the hardcore band Outline and Evan was in the punk band Random Task. After the dissolution of these bands, Steel Train formed in 2002. The band soon signed to Drive Thru Records/MCA and flew to Los Angeles to record with Jon Naclerio at Hans Zimmer's Media Ventures Studios. The outcome of this session was the band's first EP, 2003's ‚Äò‚ÄòFor You My Dear‚Äô‚Äô. The band then embarked on two of years of touring across America, Canada and the UK, followed by a trip to San Francisco to record their first full-length record with Steven Barncard (Grateful Dead, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young). Released on April 19, 2005, Twilight Tales From The Prairies on the Sun features appearances by famed mandolinist David Grisman (Grateful Dead), as well as pedal steel guitarist Gene Parsons (The Flying Burrito Brothers). Rolling Stone gave the album 3.5 stars. 2005 was also the beginning of Steel Train's festival career. They played a midnight set on the first day of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, as well as the Wakarusa Festival, Warped Tour, SXSW, and another appearance at Bonnaroo in 2006.

Following the ‚Äò‚ÄòLate Night with Conan O'Brien performance‚Äô‚Äô and a tour with The Hush Sound, the band headed back into the studio, this time to record their third full- length album with producer Steve McDonald (Fun). It was at this time that the band's relationship with their label, Drive Thru Records, fell apart. Steel Train decided to buy off the label and fund the recording themselves. Once again the band hit the road, touring with [Tegan and Sara], [Ben Folds], and Fun (band), as well as playing 2010's Coachella Music Festival and making their 2nd appearance on National TV on the ‚Äò‚ÄòLate Show with David Letterman‚Äô‚Äô.

It was established in 1862 as the independent Glasgow Veterinary College, being subsumed into the University in 1949 and gaining independent faculty status in 1969. In 2010 it became a constituent school of the new College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences. It ranked second in the UK by the Complete University Guide 2016 and in 2015, QS World University Rankings ranked the veterinary school seventh in the world for veterinary medicine. Early days In 1859, James McCall, Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at the Dick Veterinary College in Edinburgh, moved to Glasgow and started a practice in Hope Street, from which he gave informal lectures in veterinary medicine. In 1862, formal classes were instituted and the practice moved to a larger accommodation, a set of stables at 397 Parliamentary Road. In 1863, a royal warrant was issued which established McCall's enterprise as the Glasgow Veterinary College and entitled its students to examination at the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons; the first graduate qualified in 1865. The College was the second veterinary school in Scotland, after the Dick School in Edinburgh, McCall's alma mater, which was established in 1823. In 1873, it moved to much larger facilities in Buccleuch Street, a former pumping station, and merged into the University of Glasgow in 1949. The current Vet School was built on the Garscube Estate in 1970. Facilities The School is now based at the Garscube Estate in Bearsden, on the outskirts of Glasgow, purchased by the University in 1948 from Sir George Campbell of Succoth. Sir George was a descendant of Ilay Campbell, Lord Succoth, who had studied Law at the University and later served as Lord President of the Court of Session and Rector of the University. The main Garscube House had been used as a hospital during the Second World War. The School has a farm, a Small Animal Hospital and an Equine Hospital on the Estate, as well as the James Herriot Library, named for Alf Wight, a graduate of the School who wrote under that name. The University's Wolfson Halls are also situated on the Estate, as is the Garscube Sports Complex, used by the School's student rugby team as well as other students and sports clubs in the University. The school also has facilities on the Cochno Estate, purchased by the University in 1954. The Estate originally extended to some , including of woodland, but is now an business enterprise, including a farm and the elegant Cochno House. Cochno was formerly the seat of the Hamiltons of Barnes, but during the late nineteenth century, the Estate was home to William Anderson Donaldson, a Glasgow iron merchant of the firm, James Watson & Company. Degree The school presents students for the degree of Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery (BVMS). This is one of only six degree programmes in Europe recognised by the American Veterinary Medical Association, and is one of a small number recognised automatically by the South African Veterinary Council. The school scored 95% for 'graduate prospects' and 5B for 'research quality' in The Times Good University Guide 2009.

The book was published in 2004 by Wayne State University Press. Contributors to the work include academics associated with Northern Kentucky University, the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìStevens Point, The Australian National University, and the University of Sydney. The book discusses the nature of The Simpsons, and its impact on society from the perspective of popular culture and that of political satire. The work received a positive review from Luke E. Saladin of Scripps Howard News Service for the breadth of issues discussed in the book, and was criticized by Cathlena Martin in a review in the journal ImageTexT: Interdisciplinary Comics Studies for a lack of discussion and analysis of gender issues and the role of women in the television series. Authors John Alberti, the editor of the work, is also the writer of the book's introduction. Alberti teaches American literature and critical studies at Northern Kentucky University, where he is an associate professor of English. Alberti notes that there is a distinction between poking fun at something and satire: \\"Satire involves defining a kind of moral or political point of view and using humor to show how it's not living up to this ethical standard.\\" Alberti told CanWest News Service that rather than the Fox Network, the most valuable database for information on The Simpsons when doing research for the book was \\"an online archive established, maintained and vetted by unpaid Simpsons enthusiasts\\". Other contributors include David L. G. Arnold, who teaches English at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìStevens Point; Duncan Stuart Beard, who holds a Ph.D. in English literature from The Australian National University; and Mick Broderick, Associate Director of the Centre for Millennial Studies the University of Sydney. Contents The book analyzes the impact of The Simpsons ‚Äì both as a popular television program as well as its use of political satire. Leaving Springfield discusses the financial success the program has had; despite often parodying the forms of capitalism it also promotes. Commentators in the book take a look at the use of parody and satire in society to critique itself, by discussing the impact of the television series on its viewership and its place within television comedy history. Reception Luke E. Saladin of Scripps Howard News Service notes that an \\"especially popular theme in the essays\\" contained in the work is the fact that The Simpsons promotes its nature as a corporate product of Fox, while simultaneously denigrating the Fox network in jabs during the program. Saladin also notes that essays in the book discuss The Simpsons' \\"place in television history, its treatment of social issues and capitalism, and everything else from the Cold War and nuclear arms to what Homer Simpson's narcissism tells us about our own tendencies\\". In her review of the book for the journal ImageTexT: Interdisciplinary Comics Studies, Cathlena Martin is critical, and points out that the book \\"lacks a feminist study of The Simpsons\\", noting: \\"A weakness of this collection is that it does not address more gender issues and analyze the main or supporting female characters more. ... The lack of analysis with regard to the female members of Springfield is decisively missing.\\" Jeremy G. Butler cites the book as an example in his work Television: Critical Methods and Applications, when noting that \\"books on The Simpsons have become a cottage industry\\". An essay from the book on \\"Cultural Conflicts\\" is required reading in a sociology course on The Simpsons: \\"The Simpsons Global Mirror\\", at the University of California, Berkeley.

Applications Octyl glucoside has become one of the most important detergents for purification of membrane proteins because it generally does not denature the protein and can readily be removed from final protein extracts. Above its critical micelle concentration of 0.025 M (~0.7% w/v), it was noted as the best detergent for improving selectivity of immunoprecipitation of phosphotyrosine modified proteins. This detergent has also been shown to rapidly inactivate infective HIV at concentrations above its CMC. The compound gained popularity with researchers following the publication of an improved synthesis in 1978.See PubMed search for \\"octyl[Title] AND glucoside[Title]\\" for a timeline of publications. However, in 1990 the cost remained prohibitive for large-scale protein isolation.

It is saprobic on wood, like other Crepidotus species, but it can also decompose herbaceous forest litter. The species is characterized by large, punctate, ellipsoid spores, and the white, hairy pileus. The specific epithet versutus is derived from the Latin word (clever), which may be a reference to the ability of the fungus to correctly orient itself for growth depending on the position of its growing surface. Google Books The basionym of this species is Agaricus versutus Peck 1878.Peck CH. (1878). Annual Report of the New York state Museum. 30: 70. Older, obsolete synonyms include Crepidotus bresadolae and Crepidotus pubescens. Description The pileus is typically 5‚Äì14 mm in diameter, initially resupinate, then later turned up. It is attached dorsally or laterally to the substrate. Fan- or kidney-shaped, it is dry, white, and covered with a layer of soft hairs which may or may not be matted. The outer edge is rolled slightly inwards. The context is thin, soft, and white. Both the odor and taste of this mushroom are mild. The gills radiate from an eccentric or lateral point of attachment, medium broad, and tend to swell in the middle. The gill spacing is sub-distant, with many short gills (lamellulae) that do not reach the attachment point. The gills are initially white, then later tinged a rusty-brown color. The spore print is cinnamon-brown in color. This species has no stipe, although it may have a small tubercle attaching it to its growing surface. =Microscopic features= The basidiospores are 7‚Äì11 x 4.5‚Äì6 ¬µm in size, ellipsoid in shape, marked with very small spots, and yellowish to yellowish-brown under microscopic view. Basidia are 27‚Äì32 x 6‚Äì7 ¬µm and 4-spored. Pleurocystidia are absent. The cheilocystidia are 22‚Äì63 x 3‚Äì12 ¬µm, cylindric, and either swelling in the middle, or bottle-shaped. The gill trama are interwoven or at times subparallel, the hyphae 4‚Äì7 ¬µm in diameter. The generative tissue below the hymenium (subhymenium) is arranged in a parallel fashion. The cuticle (the outer layer of the fruiting body) is made of dense interwoven hyphae, connected to a tuft of colorless, long, slender (2.5‚Äì5 ¬µm diameter) hyphae. There are no clamp connections in the epicuticular hyphae, but there are on the hyphae of the tomentum at the base of the pileus. (Description adapted from Hesler & Smith, 1965Hesler LR, Smith AH.

In 783, Zhao Zongru was made Tuntian Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®, Gongbu), and continued to serve as imperial scholar as well. After his father Zhao Hua died later that year or shortly thereafter when fleeing Chang'an in light of Zhu Ci's rebellion (which also caused Emperor Dezong to flee),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 228. Zhao Zongru left public service to observe a mourning period for his father. After the mourning period was over, he returned to public service and successively served as Simen Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®, Xingbu) and Sixun Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, Libu). In 790, Emperor Dezong put Zhao in charge of evaluating the officials' performance, and it was said that Zhao carried out this task diligently and fairly. Emperor Dezong approved of his actions and made him Kaogong Langzhong (), a supervisorial official at the ministry of civil service affairs. He later left public service again to observe a mourning period for his mother, and after the mourning period was over was made Libu Langzhong (), also a supervisorial post at the ministry of civil service affairs. In 795, he was made an imperial attendant (Áµ¶‰∫ã‰∏≠, Jishizhong). In 796, he was made chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), along with Cui Sun. Virtually nothing is recorded in history about his acts as chancellor, however, and in 798 he was removed from the post and made a staff member of Emperor Dezong's crown prince Li Song.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 235. After Zhao's removal as chancellor, it was said that he was careful in his action and all he did was attend imperial meetings when called. Emperor Dezong approved of his carefulness, and in 804 made him the deputy minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang). When he met Zhao, he stated: \\"I know that you, Lord, have closed your doors for six years, and therefore decided to give you this office. Do you still remember how you were given commissions on the same day as my old subject ([i.e., Zhao Hua])?\\" Zhao was so touched that he wept prostrate.  Service under Emperors Shunzong and Xianzong  In 805, Emperor Dezong died, and Li Song succeeded him (as Emperor Shunzong).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 236. Emperor Shunzong put Zhao Zongru in charge of drafting the mourning text for Emperor Dezong. Early in the Yuanhe (806-820) era of Emperor Shunzong's son Emperor Xianzong, Zhao was made the defender of the eastern capital Luoyang. He was later recalled to serve, successively, as the minister of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, L«êbu Shangshu) and then minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Hubu Shangshu). He was thereafter made the military governor (Jiedushi) of Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei) as well as the mayor of its capital Jiangling Municipality (). While serving there, he released 2,000 soldiers who were not needed from their commissions. In 811, he was recalled to serve as the minister of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Xingbu Shangshu). In 813, he was made the military governor of Shannan West Circuit (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) as well as the mayor of its capital Xingyuan Municipality (). In 814, he was recalled to serve as chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤Â§ßÂ§´, Yushi Daifu), but soon was made the military governor of Hezhong Circuit (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) as well as the mayor of its capital Hezhong Municipality. While there, there was an occasion when he was accused of wrongly spending money allocated for soldiers' salaries, and he was fined one month's worth of his own salary. In 816, he was recalled to serve as the minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Bingbu Shangshu). Shortly after, he was made an advisor to Emperor Xianzong's crown prince Li Heng, but was also acting minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, L√¨bu Shangshu, note different tone than the minister of rites). In 819, he became full minister of civil service affairs.  Service under Emperors Muzong, Jingzong, and Wenzong  After Emperor Xianzong died in 820 and Li Heng succeeded him (as Emperor Muzong), Emperor Muzong, as he was still in the mourning period for Emperor Xianzong, requested that the officials from the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng) be in charge presiding over the imperial examinations, rather than having him personally do so. Zhao Zongru opposed on the basis that this was against tradition and that there was no time to revise the examination method before the examinees would be forced to leave the capital. Emperor Muzong agreed. Thereafter, Zhao was again made an advisor to the crown prince, but also was acting as minister of worship (Â§™Â∏∏Âçø, Taichang Qing).However, as there was no crown prince at the time, the post of advisor to the crown prince was entirely honorary. In 821, he was made acting You Pushe (), one of the heads of the executive bureau, as well as minister of worship. Part of his responsibilities included supervising a musical corps known as the Lion Orchestra (Â∏´Â≠êÊ®Ç, Shizi Yue), which was ordinarily not used except for the solemn imperial meetings and which used decorations of five different colors, representing the five directions (including center). With Emperor Muzong being young and frivolous, giving much authorities to his musicians, the eunuchs who directed the palace musical corps demanded that the five-colored decorations be given to the palace musical corps. Zhao did not dare to refuse, but reported this to the chancellors. The chancellors, however, felt that it was Zhao's responsibility to refuse this improper demand, and believing Zhao to be cowardly, had him removed and serve only as advisor to the crown prince. In 825, when Emperor Muzong's son Emperor Jingzong was emperor, Zhao was made a senior advisor to the crown prince. When Emperor Jingzong died in 826 and was succeeded by his brother Emperor Wenzong, Zhao was made the director of Daming Palace (). In 830, Emperor Wenzong made him acting Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫, one of the Three Excellencies) and senior advisor to the crown prince. Emperor Wenzong summoned him and asked him for advice, and he responded, \\"The way of Emperor Yao and Emperor Shun [(two mythical emperors known for their benevolent rule)] were based on kindness and frugality. I wish that Your Imperial Majesty would keep that in mind.\\" Emperor Wenzong appreciated the advice. In 831, when the chancellor Song Shenxi was falsely accused of treason, Emperor Wenzong convened a group of senior officials to discuss potential punishments. Zhao was one of the senior officials summoned, but on account of his old age, Emperor Wenzong ordered that he not be required to bow. Soon thereafter, Zhao requested to retire, and in 832, Emperor Wenzong approved of the retirement after conferring on him the full Sikong status. Zhao died in the fall of 832 and was posthumously honored. He was remembered for having come to prominence due to his literary abilities, having served three terms as military governor, and having been in charge of selecting officials eight times. However, he was criticized for being not careful in the rites and paying too much unnecessary attention to details of life.

The flips are defined by taking a convex hull of a polygon and reflecting a pocket with respect to the boundary edge. The theorem is named after mathematicians Paul Erd≈ës and B√©la Sz≈ëkefalvi-Nagy. Statement A pocket of a non-convex simple polygon is a simple polygon bounded by a consecutive sequence of edges of the polygon together with a single edge of its convex hull that is not an edge of the polygon itself. Every convex hull edge that is not a polygon edge defines a pocket in this way. A flip of a pocket is obtained by reflecting the polygon edges that bound the pocket, across a reflection line containing the convex hull edge. Because the reflected pocket lies entirely within the reflected image of the convex hull, on the other side of this line, this operation cannot introduce any crossings, so the result of a flip is another simple polygon, with larger area. In some cases, a single flip will cause a non-convex simple polygon to become convex. Once this happens, no more flips are possible. The Erd≈ës‚ÄìNagy theorem states that it is always possible to find a sequence of flips that produces a convex polygon in this way. More strongly, for every simple polygon, every sequence of flips will eventually produce a convex polygon, in a finite number of steps. There exist quadrilaterals that require an arbitrarily large (but finite) number of flips to be made convex. Therefore, it is not possible to bound the number of steps as a function of the number of sides of the polygon.  History  Paul Erd≈ës conjectured the result in 1935 as a problem in the American Mathematical Monthly. In the version posed by Erd≈ës, all pockets are to be flipped simultaneously; however, this may cause the polygon to become non-simple, as two pockets may flip on top of each other. In 1939, Sz≈ëkefalvi- Nagy pointed out this problem with Erd≈ës's formulation, reformulated the problem in its now-standard form, and published a proof. Sz≈ëkefalvi-Nagy's proof had an incorrect case, which was pointed out in a 1995 survey of the problem by Branko Gr√ºnbaum; however, the proofs by Gr√ºnbaum and Godfried Toussaint are similarly incomplete. Additional proofs (some but not all correct) were provided in 1957 by two independent Russian mathematicians, Reshetnyak and Yusupov, in 1959, by Bing and Kazarinoff, and in 1993 by Wegner. Demaine, Gassend, O'Rourke, and Toussaint survey this history and provide a corrected proof. Variations An alternative method of making non- convex polygons convex that has also been studied is to perform flipturns, 180-degree rotations of a pocket around the midpoint of its convex hull edge.

This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation B.L.Burtt when citing a botanical name. Education & Career Burtt, in a career that spanned 74 years, worked first at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and then at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE). He made numerous field trips to South Africa and Sarawak and described a total of 637 new plant species, of which the greater number were Gesneriaceae, a family poorly represented at the RBGE when Burtt started there in 1951. Members of this family are key indicators of habitat health. He was educated at Dulwich College, excelling in Latin. After Dulwich he was employed at Kew as herbarium assistant to Arthur William Hill,http://rsnz.natlib.govt.nz/volume/rsnz_72/rsnz_72_00_000520.pdf the Director. Here he learnt to work with dried plant material from all over the world, painstakingly dissecting and classifying. Burtt wrote his first paper in 1932 with the assistance of John Hutchinson, the authority on South African plants. This was the first of 384 papers, the final being published in 2006. Another of his papers appeared in 1935 and was co-authored by the Director, Arthur William Hill, dealing with two genera from New Zealand, Tasmania and Australia, Gaultheria and Pernettya. He took night classes in botany at Chelsea Polytechnic, and was awarded an external Bachelor of Science from the University of London in 1936. No work had been done at RBGE on Zingiberaceae until the 1960s when Burtt and Paddy Woods went on a collecting trip to Sarawak. By the 1980s RBGE led the world in their extensive living collection of Zingiberaceae from Malaysia and Borneo, only being rivalled in recent years by that of the Smithsonian Institution.Times obituary In 1962 Burtt left Edinburgh on the first of five strenuous collecting trips to Sarawak. He made the first of 19 visits to South Africa in 1964, to collect and study Streptocarpus. Here he made the acquaintance of fellow botanist Olive Hilliard of Natal University, and started a collaboration which would last some 44 years. Their botanical collaboration was extraordinarily prolific, resulting in numerous papers and three books, Streptocarpus: an African Plant Study (1971), The Botany of the Southern Natal Drakensberg (1987), and Dierama: The Hairbells of Africa (1991). They revised the taxonomy of the twinspur, Diascia, a South African member of the Scrophulariaceae. The diascias with which they returned to Scotland were noticed by the nurseryman Hector Harrison, who raised cultivars from this original stock and turned the plant in the space of ten years into one of the most popular subjects for gardeners throughout Britain. Through Burtt's work, Edinburgh became an important research centre for Gesneriaceae, and led to the popularity in Britain of African violet and Streptocarpus as window-sill plants. Another favoured family were the Zingiberaceae, among which are ginger, turmeric, cardamom and some species of medicinal interest. =Honours and awards= In 2003 the Edinburgh Journal of Botany published a festschrift for his 90th birthday, including numerous contributions from friends and colleagues scattered throughout the world. An attractive tree-dwelling Aeschynanthus from Sulawesi, Aeschynanthus burttii Mendum was named in his honour. Burtt could transform quite readily from his customary Edinburgh tweed suit to a khaki safari outfit suitable for the tropics, at ease in either habitat. Burtt was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Linnean Society of London, and a holder of the Veitch Memorial Medal of the Royal Horticultural Society, the Linnean Society of London‚Äôs Medal for Botany and the Gesneriad Society‚Äôs Award of Appreciation.Botanical Electronic News obituaryThe Independent obituary =Personal= After the death in 2004 of his wife Joyce, from whom he had separated in the 1960s, Burtt married Olive Hilliard. He is survived by Olive Hilliard, and the two sons of his first marriage.

Royal Dunedin Male Choir  History  The Choir's origins can be traced back to 1878 and the entertainment provided at functions marking the opening of the northern railway link into Dunedin. From this evolved a Liedertaefel Quartet which, in response to public demand, was to become the Dunedin Liedertaefel Society which was incorporated on 1 May 1886. Its aims were stated as \\"the practice and performance of music for male voices, and for the cultivation of a refined taste in that class of music\\". Its founder was Mr. S. Moyle.Campbell, Margaret. Music in Dunedin. Dunedin: Charles Begg and Co., 1945, p. 43. In 1915 the name was changed to the Dunedin Male Choir,Campbell, Margaret. Music in Dunedin.

The activities of the Choir are administered by a Committee, elected at the Annual General Meeting.  Patronage  The Choir's constitution stipulates the Mayor of Dunedin is their patron.  The Musical Directors (Conductors)  The Royal Dunedin Male Choir has been led and inspired by many musical directors and conductors. Beginning with the choir's founder Samuel Moyle in 1886, he was followed by: Benno Scherek, Arthur Barth, Raphael Squarise, Jesse Timson (25 years), Dr Victor Galway (17 years), Alfred Walmsley, William Francis, Ernest Drake, Charles Collins, Gilmore McConnell, Donald Munro, James Clark, Val Drew (a record 26 years), Harry Madden, Les Bonar, Richard Madden (son of Harry Madden) who took up the position in 2001. Richard retired at the end of 2019. From 2020 the choir had been conducted by John Buchanan (MNZM).  Accompanists  The choir has been well served by 27 pianists since 1886 and, coming forward in time, have included: Edward Taylor, Chas Martin, Colin Oliver, Iain Kerr, Judy Faris (n√©e Galloway) with a record 27 years service, and from 1994 to the present, Linda Folland (n√©e Kydd).  Membership  Membership of the Royal Dunedin Male Choir is open to male singers from all walks of life who share a common delight in choral singing. The choir comprises four sectional groups; First Tenors, Second Tenors (or Leads), First Basses (or Baritones) and Second Basses. Following a successful audition the Musical Director will assigns a singer to one of these sections based on his assessment of the singer's vocal range.  Repertoire  Over the past 122 years the choir has been in existence it has sung a huge array of different music styles and genres. The list is far too long to display here but has included traditional hymns such as \\"The 23rd Psalm\\", Spirituals the likes of \\"I'm Gwine to Sing\\" and \\"Kentucky Babe\\", and songs from the popular operatic musicals like Phantom Of the Opera, Porgy and Bess, Oklahoma, and My Fair Lady. The choir also enjoys singing the big heart-warming songs such as \\"Gwahoddiad\\", \\"American Trilogy\\" and \\"And the Glory of the Lord\\" (from Handel's Messiah). The choir stages two major concerts in the Dunedin Town Hall each year: one around mid-year (June) and a Christmas Concert in early December.

History The company was founded in early 2003 by a group of film students as a company that imported Asian horror films. Heng Tola was one of the producers. The company was formerly the owner of Kirirom Cinema, which closed in 2007 and was turned into a nightclub. Their first film, Gratefulness, was inspired by the true life story of a young girl. The film has many similarities to Thai 1980s drama Walli. The next movie was a period horror film called Neang Neath, which performed well at the Cambodia box office. The film was a remake of the Thai film Nang Nak., Movies and The culture around The World The company made several Karaoke as well in this period, but discontinued in late 2004 to concentrate on making movies. The next projects were successful horror genre films such as The Forest, The Haunted House, and Ghost Banana Tree, the highest grossing film for the company. Campro Productions received good press for their highly professional work and quality productions. Despite the current taste for horror movies, Heng Tola believes a more serious trend is emerging, prompted in part by the resentment many Cambodians feel about their colonial past and toward domineering neighbours such as Thailand and Vietnam. , Taipei Times. The company produced some dramas and comedies, including Gratefulness, Motherless, Mr. Moa, The Wall of Love, and The Painter' (film) but most failed at the box office.

These amides conceptually can be formed from a fatty acid and ethanolamine with the release of a molecule of water, but the known biological synthesis uses a specific phospholipase D to cleave the phospholipid unit from N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines. Another route relies on the transesterification of acyl groups from phosphatidylcholine by an N-acyltransferase (NAT) activity. The suffixes -amine and -amide in these names each refer to the single nitrogen atom of ethanolamine that links the compound together: it is termed \\"amine\\" in ethanolamine because it is considered as a free terminal nitrogen in that subunit, while it is termed \\"amide\\" when it is considered in association with the adjacent carbonyl group of the acyl subunit. Names for these compounds may be encountered with either \\"amide\\" or \\"amine\\" varying by author.For example, note synonyms in PubChem for oleoylethanolamine. Examples of N-acylethanolamines include:The list and references provided are based on background discussion in * Anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine; NAE) or arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA: C22H37NO2; 20:4, œâ-6) is the amide of arachidonic acid (C20H32O2; 20:4, œâ-6) and ethanolamine (MEA: C2H7NO). It is the ligand of both cannabinoid receptors and vanilloid receptor that attenuates pain sensation. * N-Palmitoylethanolamine (PEA: C18H37NO2; 16:0) is the amide of palmitic acid (C16H32O2; 16:0) and ethanolamine. It is a ligand at CB2 receptors. It has anti-inflammatory activity and also attenuates pain sensation in mammals. NAE 16:0 has also been identified in plants including corn, and seeds of cotton, okra, tomato, castor bean, soya bean and peanuts, but its physiological functions remain unknown, * N-Oleoylethanolamine (OEA: C20H39NO2; 18:1, œâ-9) is the amide of oleic acid (C18H34O2; 18:1) and ethanolamine. It has anorexic effects and enables fat breakdown by stimulating PPAR-alpha. In plants, NAE 18:1 is present abundantly in dry seeds and levels decline during seed imbibition, but its physiological functions are yet to be elucidated. In humans, plasma OEA levels are also found positively correlated with positive mood and emotions. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. * N-Stearoylethanolamine (SEA: C20H41NO2; 18:0) is the amide of stearic acid (C18H36O2) and ethanolamine. It has pro-apoptotic activity. It operates independently of the known cannabinoid and vanilloid receptors targeted by anandamide. It is an inhibitor of the sphingolipid signaling pathway, via specific ceramidase inhibition (ceramidase converts ceramide to sphingosine) and blocks the effects of TNF- and arachidonic acid on intracellular Ca2+ concentration. * N-Docosahexaenoylethanolamine (C24H37NO2; 22:6,œâ-10), \\"synaptamide\\", is the amide of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA: C22H32O2; 22:6, œâ-3) and ethanolamine. It has anti-proliferative effects on prostate cancer cell lines and promotes synaptogenesis, neurogenesis and neuritogenesis, and as an endogenous metabolite of DHA, it promotes brain development and function. *N-Docosatetraenoylethanolamine (DEA: C24H41NO2; 22:4,œâ-6) act on the CB1 receptor, and possible CB2. *N-homo-gamma- linolenoylethanolamine, or Anandamide (20:3,n-6) (HGLEA: C22H39NO2; 20:3,œâ-6). These bioactive lipid amides are generated by the membrane enzyme NAPE-PLD, and natural bile acids regulate this essential process. All are members of the endocannabinoidome, a complex lipid signaling system composed of more than 100 of fatty acid-derived mediators and their receptors, its anabolic and catabolic enzymes of more than 50 proteins, which are deeply involved in the control of energy metabolism and its pathological deviations, as well as immunosuppression. Beyond vertebrates NAEs are also found to have signaling roles in more primitive organism, implicated as metabolic signals that coordinate nutrient status and lifespan determination in Caenorhabditis elegans, and detected in organisms as diverse as yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), freshwater fish (Esox lucius and Cyprinus carpio), bivalve mollusc (Mytilus galloprovincialis), protists (Tetrahymena thermophila), slime mold (Dictyostelium discoideum), microbes such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses, are all organisms that appear to regulate their endogenous NAE levels via similar enzymatic machinery as mammalian vertebrates, show a widespread occurrence of NAEs, from single-celled organisms to humans, and a highly conserved role for this group of lipids in cell signaling.  Mood  As the euphoric feeling described after running, called the \\"runners high\\" is, at least in part, due to increased circulating endocannabinoids (eCBs), and these lipid signaling molecules are involved in reward, appetite, mood, memory and neuroprotection, an analysis of endocannabinoid concentrations and moods after singing, dancing, exercise and reading in healthy volunteers, showed that singing increased plasma levels of anandamide (AEA) by 42%, palmitoylethanolamine (PEA) by 53% and oleoylethanolamine (OEA) by 34%, and improved positive mood and emotions. Dancing did not affect eCB levels, but decreased negative mood and emotions. Cycling increased OEA levels by 26%, and reading increased OEA levels by 28%. All the ethanolamines were positively correlated with heart rate. As so, the plasma OEA levels were positively correlated with positive mood and emotions, and AEA levels were seen positively correlated with satiation. It is found, that the 20:4 NAE (AEA) increase, only appear in response to medium-intensity workout, and the 16:0 NAE (PEA) and 18:1 NAE (OEA) also increases during and after this workout, but are more responsive to lower intensity than 20:4 NAE (AEA). In mice that exercise, show an increase of 20:4 NAE (AEA) and 18:1 NAE (OEA) levels, in association with decreased GABAergic neuron CB1-dependent anxiety. In exercise addicts, which have increased negative mood in response to exercise deprivation, is found to have lower basal circulating 20:4 NAE (AEA) levels than non-addicted regular runners, and exercise withdrawal and reintroduction only decreases and increases these levels, respectively, in non-addicts, and the lack of response of 20:4 NAE (AEA) in exercise addicts is suggested, that their increased amount of exercise is a homeostatic attempt to increase the endocannabinoide and NAE-tone, with its subsequently activation of related receptors.  Metabolic production of NAEs  Diets in mammals, containing 20:4,n‚àí6 and 22:6,n‚àí3, are found to increase several biologically active NAEs in brain homogenates as metabolic products, like 20:4,n‚àí6 NAE (4-fold), 20:5,n‚àí3 NAE (5-fold), and 22:5,n‚àí3 and 22:6,n‚àí3 NAE (9- to 10-fold). The increase in all of the metabolic NAEs is regarded biologically important, because NAEs having fatty acids with at least 20 carbons and three double bonds bind to CB1 receptors, and endogenously released NAE 20:4 and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG: C23H38O4; 20:4,n-6) are also found to activate CB2 receptors in addition. The hydrolysis of NAE to free fatty acid (FFA) and ethanolamine (MEA) in animals, is catalyzed by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) or by a N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase (NAAA), and the polyunsaturated NAEs such as NAE 18:2, NAE 18:3, or NAE 20:4 can also be oxygenated via lipoxygenase (LOX) or cyclooxygenase (COX), to produce ethanolamide oxylipins, like prostaglandin ethanolamides (prostamide) by COX-2, with various potential bioactivities that may have enhanced affinity with cannabinoid receptors in comparison to their respective non-oxygenated NAEs, as well as to oxygenated eicosanoid ethanolamides, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes, all believed to be important signaling compounds. The major COX-2 derived prostanoid product from NAE 20:4 (AEA) are prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) ethanolamide (PGE2-EA; prostamide E2) and PGD2 ethanolamide (PGD2-EA; prostamide D2), might have many important functions, as PGE2 and PGD2 are pro- inflammatory mediators responsible for the induction of inflammation, PGE2-EA and PGD2-EA are contrary both growth inhibitory and can induce apoptosis, as well as that NAE 20:4 (AEA) and/or its prostamide metabolites in the renal medulla, may represent medullipin and function as a regulator of body fluid and the mean arterial pressure (MAP). In addition to metabolism by FAAH, COX-2 and LOXs, NAE 20:4 (AEA) can also undergo oxidation by several of human cytochrome P450 (CYPs) enzymes, resulting in various oxidized lipid species, some of which have biological relevance as CYP-derived epoxides, that can act as a potent agonist of CB2 receptors. Similar pathways of hydrolysis or oxidation of NAEs are also found in plant cells.  NAEs in plants  N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), constitute a class of lipid compounds naturally present in both animal and plant membranes, as constituents of the membrane- bound phospholipid, N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE). NAPE is composed of a third fatty acid moiety linked to the amino head group of the commonly occurring membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylethanolamine. It is found, that the levels of NAEs increases 10- to 50-fold in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves treated with fungal elicitors, as a protection against it, by producing the N-myristoylethanolamine (Myristamide-MEA: C16H33NO2; NAE 14:0), that specific binds to a protein in tobacco membranes with biochemical properties appropriate for the physiological responses, and it do not show identical binding properties to NAE-binding proteins in intact tobacco microsomes, compared to non-intact microsomes. In addition to this, antagonists of mammalian CB receptors was seen to block both of the biological activities previously attributed to NAE 14:0, this endogenous NAE that is accumulated in tobacco cell suspensions and leaves after pathogen elicitor perception, is why it is proposed, that plants possess an NAE-signaling pathway with functional similarities to the ‚Äúendocannabinoid‚Äù pathway of animal systems, and this pathway, in part, participates in xylanase elicitor perception in the tobacco plant, as well as in the Arabidopsis and Medicago truncatula plant tissues.  Medical values  N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), with its cell-protective and stress-combating action-response of organisms, have showed promise as therapeutic potential in treating bacterial, fungal, and viral infections, as NAEs also exhibit anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiviral properties, which have considerable application potential.

His grandson and successor Ramakrishna Ranga Rao served as the Chief Minister of Madras Presidency from 1932 to 1936.  Early life  Venkata Ranga Rao was born at Venkatagiri on November 29, 1862. He was the fourth son of Sarvagnya Krishna Rao Bahadur, the Raja of Venkatagiri. When Venkata Ranga Rao was nine years old, he along with the other younger sons of the family were given away in adoption to the royal houses of Bobbili, Pittapur and Jetprole. Venkata Ranga Rao was adopted by Rani Lakshmi Chellayama of Bobbili. He was tutored by J. Marsh apart from other Indian tutors. He was provided with extensive tutoring in history, economy and Sanskrit.  Marriage  Venkata Ranga Rao married in 1878. The princess died an untimely death in 1880 after giving birth to their only son Venkata Kumara Krishna Ranga Rao. Venkata Ranga Rao married again, to a younger sister of the princess. On November 30, 1881, on his attaining majority, Venkata Ranga Rao ascended the throne of Bobbili.  Reign  Venkata Ranga Rao brought about a number of reforms during his reign as Raja of Bobbili. He raised the Middle School of Bobbili to a high school. He also established a poor schools and those for the physically and mentally handicapped. In 1883, while Venkata Ranga Rao was on pilgrimage to Kasi, his second wife died in childbirth. This incident followed by the death of his adoptive mother and second son in 1887 had a traumatic effect on him. In 1888, the Raja married for a third time. A third son, Ramakrishna Ranga Rao, was born in 1892. The Raja constructed the \\"Raj Mahal\\" palace in Bobbili in 1888. At that time, there arose a succession dispute between the heirs to the estate of Venkatagiri. Venkata Ranga Rao mediated between the sons of the late Raja and helped in resolving the dispute. In 1893, Venkata Ranga Rao made a tour of Europe along with his youngest brother Venugopala Ranga Rao. Landing at Marseilles on April 14, 1893, the Raja had audiences with the Duke of York, the Prince of Wales and Queen Victoria. The gratified Raja displayed his loyalty to the British crown by constructing the Victoria Market in 1887 and the Victoria Town Hall in 1894 in honour of the Queen. In 1902, Venkata Ranga Rao was chosen to represent the Presidency of Madras at the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in London.  Honors  In 1895, Venkata Ranga Rao was knighted in Ootacamund with the KCIE at a public ceremony presided over by Lord Wenlock, the then Governor of Madras. He was promoted to a GCIE in 1911.

The reservoir lies mostly in the townships of Hopewell Township and Upper Deerfield Township. The lake was created by damming a stream that feeds to the area from above Seeley Lake. And a stream that feeds into the lake from the nearby Mary Elmer Lake also located in Bridgeton. The dam is located next to Park Drive, a major roadway that cuts throughout the city's park system and interconnects with Route 49. Just across the turnpike in Deerfield it opens over in the \\"Silly Pond\\". The water from Sunset Lake flows over the spillway dam and into the Cohansey River. Originally, the lake was known as Tumbling Dam Pond.  Sunset Lake (present day)  Sunset Lake is home to canoe rentals and a swimming behgoxrtygcttach (Stony Point Beach) operated by the City of Bridgeton Dept. of Recreation.City Parks Division , City of Bridgeton. The lake also offers picnic areas, a boat ramp (public access to Sunset Lake is provided from the Bridgeton City Park, just off of County Road 607) at Piney Point (a peninsula that juts out into the lake) and opportunities for fishing. People can kayak or canoe in the lake and carry their boats to the nearby stream that leads to the Cohansey River. Another canoeing option is the Raceway, a 19th-century earthen structure that was created as a mill race but since has been converted to recreational use. The Raceway meanders through the Cohanzick Zoo and dead- ends near Downtown Bridgeton (near the Nail House Museum). There is also a stream that one could take that feeds from Mary Elmer Lake (a nearby lake also in the Bridgeton Park System).  History  Early History of area: Sunset Lake was once the home of Tumbling Dam Park, situated at the southeast corner of Sunset Lake in Bridgeton. The Park was located on the shore of the lake and started out as a boat rental and pavilion area for picnics during the Victorian era. Eventually the park evolved to include early amusement park rides, like the one built by a local company called Pretzel Amusement Ride Company a bowling alley, baseball fields, concession stands etc. Notable celebrities of the time also visited Tumbling Dam Park; among them were counted the Wright Brothers, and Anne Oakley. The Park was damaged during the Flood of 1934 but was repaired, only later to fall into disrepair in the 1950s. The Park was eventually torn down and the land sold to developers who built houses on it. A derecho storm on August 13, 2011 caused the lake to rise and overflow its banks. Since the storm the spillway dam was repaired and the lake is now open and stocked with fish.  Wildlife  Sunset Lake is inhabited by various species. Many turtles reside in the lake's waters, including snapping turtles. Geese, ducks, and seagulls are the primary avian residents of the lake area. Aquatic residents include sunfish, catfish, and fresh water clams along with leeches.

The film was first shown at the Pusan International Film Festival in South Korea on 10 October and released on 21 October 2009 in France. It tells the story of two weddings that collide when both receptions are held at one hotel. Plot Maura (Sally Hawkins) is a down on her luck single mother who's facing eviction from her house, which lead her to the rash decision to marry an illegal immigrant, Wilson, in exchange of ‚Ç¨9,000. Maura's daughter Molly believes that her mother truly loves Wilson and that she's getting a new father. Meanwhile, Freddie (Tom Riley), a nice guy with OCD-esque habits, is remarrying the selfish and very image-conscious Sophie after a recent divorce. The receptions for both weddings are being held in the same hotel. Freddie and Maura's paths keep crossing, leading to Sophie wrongly assuming that the two are involved in an illicit affair. To complicate matters, two immigration officers arrive at the wedding reception to investigate Wilson and Maura. Eventually Molly learns that her mother is involved in a scam and has no feelings for Wilson. Believing her suspicions of an affair to be true, Sophie flees the wedding. Presuming Freddie responsible, Sophie's aggressive father loses his cool and attempts to assault Freddie. Meanwhile, Sophie has gone to a pub in Dublin with some working class girls who support her decision to run away as they believe Freddie to be a lecherous cheater. Sophie gets drunk with her new friends while Freddie is frantically trying to find her to keep his marriage afloat. It is revealed that one of the reasons for their original breakup wasn't Sophie's mental state, as insinuated, but Freddie's nervous breakdown for his inability to deal with Sophie. Facing ruin and a new divorce, Freddie tries to take his own life by throwing himself off the top floor of the hotel. However, just as he is about to jump, Maura steps in and talks him down from the ledge. When he returns to the wedding, they find both parties have joined together and a drunken Sophie has come back. Freddie and Sophie finally have an honest conversation, realise that their marriage is over and agree to part amicably. Freddie realises he has feelings for Maura, who has left the hotel with Wilson and Molly. Freddie chases after her. Maura believes that Freddie has reunited with Sophie, when he appears and convinces her otherwise. They unite and kiss. Maura then manages to convince the immigration officers that her marriage to Wilson is real. Wilson gives Maura the money he promised her and then leaves with his African girlfriend. In the end, Sophie's bully father is taken away in a straight jacket for trying to kill Freddie with an axe, and Freddie and Maura decide to take the honeymoon trip Freddie had planned for Sophie, with Molly in tow.

History and politics The British project was working against the background of the successful French Kunming-Haiphong railway that had been established on the nearby Hanoi to Kunming route from 1904‚Äì1910, some 30 years earlier. To secure the rights to construction, Britain referred to Article IV of the Anglo-French Siam Convention for 'mutual privileges'. Planning and surveying Maria Bugrova's article The British expeditions to China in XIX century discusses the question of a railway to Yunnan from Burma. :In the 1880s, Great Britain drew special attention to the Upper Burma region and the roads to southwestern China. The former colonial officer of British Burma's administration, A.R. Colquhoun, and an engineer of the Civil Works Department in India, H. Hallett, traveled in 1882 from Canton to Rangoon. A.R Colquhoun returned to England and sent his proposal to the Chamber of Commerce of Great Britain to investigate the question of building a railway between Rangoon and southwestern China through the Shan states. His proposal was approved by the Chamber. According to a preliminary calculation, the cost of work was about seven thousand pound sterling. One half of this amount had to be presented by the Chambers of Commerce, and another part had to be contributed by the Government. :By the end of 1884, Hallett and Colquhoun received 3,500 pounds from the Chamber of Commerce for the investigation of building a railway. They found important information about climate, population and minerals. They drew special attention to liking. From their point of view, penetration of British goods into China depended on the amount of this tax. The difficulty of liking question substantially explained the British traders' interest in building a railway. In case of this building it would be possible to avoid the payment of liking transferring goods to the interior of China. Colquhoun telegraphed daily to The Times about the expedition. There are references in the 1898 British Hansard regarding possible construction of the line. Archibald John Little's 1905 book The Far East mentioned the proposed route on page 124: :A railway, starting from Mandalay, goes north-east to the bank of the Salwin which is to be crossed at Kunlong Ferry in latitude 23 degrees 20', whence, if ever built, it is to be taken north in Chinese territory and run parallel with the prevailing strike of the mountains, due north to Tali-fu; but this line will pass through a wild thinly-peopled country and it is doubtful if a private company will be found to build it. In 1911, Leo Borgholz, the US Consul General in Canton, published a trade report entitled 'Yunnan Trade Districts and Routes', in which he mentions that the British appeared to have shelved the project for lack of financial viability. In 1938, Edward Michael Law-Yone travelled to Yunnan from his native Burma to see the proposed route. Construction By 1938 construction had begun. In 1941 25 2-8-8-2 mallet- type articulated engines were ordered from the American ALCO company, and American promised to supply steel for the construction effort. In 1939 it was proposed to construct the western section of the Yunnan‚ÄìBurma railway using a gauge of , since such minimum gauge facilitates the tightest of curves in difficult terrain. An article by Royal Arch Gunnison published in the San Francisco Chronicle on Thursday, November 27, 1941 stated that American Engineers still expected \\"12 to 15 months to complete\\" the railway and described a Dr. Victor Haas of the United States Public Health Service as in charge of sanitation and malaria prevention. Additional American personnel such as Paul Stevenson accepted commissions with the United States Public Health Service and were sent to assist with malaria control during the construction effort. Abandonment Construction of the line was abandoned due to Japanese advances to Lashio in May 1942. As Japanese advanced towards Yunnan the Chinese army implemented a Scorched Earth policy and dynamited rail and bridges to prevent enemy advances. :When Japan overran Burma and the west of Yunnan in 1942, China had to destroy the finished section of railway lest Japanese troops would capitalize on it. (China‚Äôs Look South: China-Myanmar Transport Corridor, Hongwei Fan, Institute of International Relations and Area Studies, Ritsumeikan University) In 1943 fighting occurred between Japanese and Chinese forces aided by US Air Support along the Yunnan-Burma railway: :CHINESE DRIVE JAPS BACK IN YUNNAN BATTLE CHUNGKING, (Yuma Sun, March 6 1943) A big Chinese counteroffensive along the Salween river in western Yunnan province has driven the Japanese hack several miles toward the Burma border, the Central News Agency reported today. The counteroffensive has been under way for a week and has resulted in recapture of many points, including Manyunkai, Pangwachai and Tassutse, it was said. The Chinese retook the town of Mongtmg and enemy troops in that area were retreating toward Kunlong, just over the border in Burma. Japanese units were reported fleeing westward from the Salween and along the Lashio-Kunming railway. Construction was never resumed. Burma's limited trading value to China and its internal political and military instability have probably been two major contributing factors. Legacy Commemorative sign at the site of the Manzhuan Tunnel. Today the Yunnan side of the line lies in ruin. Though signs here and there attest to its presence, there is little actual rail left, and the line has all but vanished from local history and barely graces itineraries of all but the most determined travellers. One such sign can be glimpsed opposite the ferry to Baodian, slightly south of Manwan in the far north-eastern section of Lincang prefecture. The sign records a tunnel from the construction, but the entry has long been covered over and there is no visual hint to the line's presence whatsoever. See also *The Burma ‚Äì Yunnan railway.

The Champagne house Juglar was absorbed into Jacquesson in 1829.Lechmere, Adam, Decanter.com (November 17, 2010). Champagne still 'fresh' after nearly two centuries in Baltic By 1867 annual sales of Jacquesson bottles had reached 1,000,000, but a period of decline followed the death of Adolphe Jacquesson, inventor of the muselet, when the descendants ceased to continue the family business, and ownership changed hands over several decades, until in 1974 when it was bought by Jean Chiquet. Present day Today it is directed with brothers Jean-Herv√© and Laurent Chiquet.

It was initially irregularly serialized in the Kindai Mahjong Original manga magazine published by Takeshobo, then switched to bimonthly serialization on Takeshobo's other mahjong manga magazine Kindai Mahjong in April 2009. An anime adaptation was released on February 26, 2010 as an original video anime. The premise of the manga is that international diplomacy is settled on the mahjong table, with real-life politicians depicted as masters of mahjong. The Japanese title is a parody of Junichiro Koizumi's slogan, . Plot In a world where all politics and diplomacy are settled via no-holds-barred mahjong battles by world politicians, Junichiro Koizumi settled scores with the United States, North Korea, and Russia before retiring as Prime Minister of Japan. However, he is recruited by the Vatican to be one of the five world leaders to counter a new international threat: the Nazis, still alive, who settled on the Moon and established the Fourth Reich. The Nazis challenges the world leaders to a best-of-five mahjong match to the death on the Guiana Highlands, but the battle is interrupted by the news of a rebellion on the Moon. After Adolf Hitler returned from the match on Earth and put down Erwin Rommel's rebellion, he beckons Koizumi to the Moon to finish the match. After a tremendous battle, Hitler is defeated while Koizumi becomes stranded on the Moon, his fate unknown. After Koizumi is presumed dead on the moon, the Japanese government under the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) established the 13th Autonomous Mahjong Corps (MJ-13) in an effort to make up for the loss of Japanese mahjong power. However, the LPD lost the 2009 elections to the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), who promptly tried to eliminate the newly established corps in the name of fiscal restructuring. The MJ-13, headed by Koizumi's hidden son Matajiro Sanada, duels three mahjong greats selected by the DPJ in a battle to decide the fate of the corps. Sanada defeats the incumbent prime minister Yukio Hatoyama in the last round, which causes the latter to lose power. It is then revealed that the LPD is planning to retrieve Koizumi from the Moon through Japan's space agency JAXA, and that MJ-13 was established to prepare for an upcoming war. A challenge is issued to Japan to send five mahjong greats to the disputed Senkaku Islands, where a mysterious \\"red box\\" is threatening the safety of nearby fishermen. The ruling DPJ does not want to get involved in the controversy for fear of angering their Chinese masters, to the point of sending ninja assassins to try to kill Sanada, who desires to sail to the islands to investigate. Eventually, in the face of falling public support, the DPJ strikes a deal with the LDP to call an election early, which the LDP wins and promptly sends the MJ-13 to the Senkaku Islands. There they discover an abandoned Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier being overtaken by Red Guards, and a preserved Mao Zedong inside the dreaded \\"red box\\". Mao challenges Japan to five mahjong matches, with each of the 5 main islands of the Senkaku Islands being the wager. Mao cites his ambition to claim the islands for his Neo Chinese Soviet Republic and eventually reclaim China from its current leaders, who he thinks have betrayed the communist cause. After Japan defeats Mao, winning all matches along the way, Lenin himself summons the mysterious figure \\"Mask of Mahjong\\" as his aide to challenge Japan to a final match. The \\"Mask of Mahjong\\" defeats Lenin in the first round, and is revealed to be Junichiro Koizumi being controlled by the head of Leon Trotsky. The war ends with the ambitions of the Neo Chinese Soviet Republic broken, and Koizumi and Sanada reuniting as father and son, both acknowledging each other's mahjong powers. After a two-year hiatus since the end of the \\"Senkaku Islands Bloody Battle\\" arc, the manga resumed in 2017 with a sequel centering on the imperial princess Hako Mikado (Âæ°ÈñÄËë©Â≠ê) playing against foreign adversaries such as American president Donald Trump. Characters Though based on real-life politicians, the characters are, as the manga's disclaimer notes, \\"works of fiction and not really related to any real-life people\\". =Japan=Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) ; :The 89th Prime Minister of Japan, the main protagonist of the story's first arc. Armed with a natural talent for mahjong, passed down from his grandfather Matajiro Koizumi, Junichiro defends Japanese interests and integrity against the heads of the world's superpowers, even after his retirement from politics. Signature skills include \\"Goumoupai\\" (ËΩüÁõ≤Áâå, scraping tiles with a tight grip to make white tiles, or change the numerical value of tiles), \\"Rising Sun\\", a 13-tile wait (Kokushi Musou) won by Tsumo with the 1-Pin, symbolizing the Japanese sun, and \\"The Beginning of the Universe\\" (all white) which is the single highest scoring hand in the series. He is voiced by Toshiyuki Morikawa in the anime adaptation. ; :Member of the Japanese Diet who is perhaps overly eager and enthusiastic about the privileges of being a Diet member and admits his greatest fear is losing his status and \\"going back to being a NEET\\". He was held hostage by the Americans twice to lure Koizumi to the mahjong table. Though doubted by his peers who think he won his seat by fluke, Koizumi acknowledges Taiz≈ç as a bringer of luck. He appears in \\"The Blood Relatives of a Lion\\" arc as the trainer for the 13th Autonomous Mahjong Corps. He plays better when in his underwear, a reference to when he was stripped during early chapters by Koizumi's opponents. He is voiced by Jun Fukuyama in the anime adaptation. ; :Another Diet member, she appears as the Prime Minister's aide and provides relevant commentary about the state of affairs on the mahjong table. Harbours hidden feelings for Koizumi, which she knows will be unrequited. She is voiced by Shizuka It≈ç in the anime adaptation. ; :The Minister for Foreign Affairs who eventually becomes the 92nd Prime Minister of Japan. Known as an able sharpshooter (since he represented the Japanese shooting team in the 1976 Summer Olympics) and plays mahjong in support for Koizumi. He is voiced by Kinry≈´ Arimoto in the anime adaptation. ; :The 90th Prime Minister of Japan. In a game against Russian president Vladimir Putin, he places Koizumi's son Kotaro Koizumi in place of his missing father. The swap is seen through by Putin, and Abe is shamed into committing seppuku. The public was told that he resigned due to diarrhea. He returns as prime minister in 2012, his abdomen now reinforced with metal. ; :Former Japanese Minister of Defense and now Secretary-General of the LDP. As Minister of Defense, he creates the 13th Autonomous Mahjong Corps to compensate the drop in Japan's mahjong might due to Koizumi's absence. It is at his suggestion that the Corps' funding be cut, so that the Corps' mahjong training can be put to the test in their struggle to save the unit. ; :The leader of the LPD when the party became the opposition party. Despite his bookish demeanour, he wields mahjong power befitting of a party leader, to Matajiro Sanada's surprise when Tar≈ç As≈ç called a match to test Sanada's power. Winning hands include the \\"Cosmic Cycler\\" (Four concealed triplets). Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) ; :Once leader of the opposition, he made his first appearance sexually harassing Yukari-tan. Obsessed with transfer of power when the LDP was in power. As one of the power brokers of the DPJ, he is not above making under-the-table deals with the LDP to ensure the interests of his party and those of his own. ; :93rd Prime Minister of Japan, first of the Democratic Party of Japan to put the traditional Liberal Democratic Party out of power. In the OVA, he is an obedient puppet to the Chinese leadership. It turns out he acts this way because he had been infested by a squid-like alien. In the manga, he is the primary antagonist of \\"The Blood Relatives of a Lion\\" arc and a puppet leader assuming the form of a Flatwoods monster pushed to the fore by the DPJ brassmen. Known for his political gaffes, which are referenced in his play style, where he commits Chombo (foul plays that force all players to rebuild their hands) when he gets unfavorable hands before winning all his points back with one high scoring hand. Voiced by Keiji Fujiwara in the OVA. ; :The alien-like wife of Yukio Hatoyama. She is his partner in the manga and reveals that she is a skilled player in her own right, having played in seedy underground mahjong parlors, which is reflected in her tendency to threaten her opponents. Despite her rough language and her and her husband's otherworldly behavior, it is made clear that she and Yukio love each other deeply. Voiced by Hitomi Nabatame in the OVA. ; :The State Minister of Government Revitalization, she relentlessly screens the numerous bureaus established by the LPD, including the 13th Autonomous Mahjong Corps, as part of the fiscal restructuring by the new DPJ government. She challenged the corps to three mahjong matches with the nation's mahjong greats of her choosing to decide the fate of the Mahjong Corps. Being the second player of these three matches, her exaggeratedly propped up collars served as receivers of secret communication signals from her sister across the table. Social Democratic Party (SDP) ; :The Social Democratic Party representative. Once opposed the rocket carrying Koizumi to the moon on the grounds that it might be used militarily, against the constitution of Japan, but was ignored by the main characters. She later appeared alongside Takako Doi in the first of three matches to decide the fate of the 13th Autonomous Mahjong Corps. ; :Former leader of the SDP known for her ultra-pacifist stance, hence hearing the words \\"Japan Self-Defense Forces\\" irritates her like hives on her skin. She is especially transfixed on the number 9, \\"the number that spells the demise of the Self-Defense Forces\\", a fact that is readily apparent when she plays on the mahjong table. 13th Autonomous Mahjong Corps ; :Main character of \\"The Blood Relatives of a Lion\\" and \\"Battle for Senkaku Islands\\" arcs. Originally the captain and commander of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force Destroyer Takao scouring the Indian Ocean for Somalian pirates, he got enlisted into the newly established 13th Autonomous Mahjong Corps for his mahjong skills. Unbeknownst to him, he is Junichiro Koizumi's illegitimate son. Signature skills include Fire \\"Riichi\\" (using the Goumanpai ËΩüÁõ≤Áâå and switching the neighboring tile with his opponents's next draw), Tomahawk Attack, and Blast Off Riichi. ; :A stoic and musclebound Sergeant First Class of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force 1st Airborne Brigade. Despite his foul mouth, he dedicates his lives to the safety of the Japanese people. ; :An engineering officer from the Technical Research and Development Institute of the Ministry of Defense. A \\"human computer\\" who \\"sold his soul to science\\", he wears tesla coils up his sleeves to optically jam his opponents' vision of the mahjong tiles (based on the Philadelphia Experiment), and has phenomenal powers of computation, able to calculate whatever hand his opponents have assembled. Others ; :A foul-mouthed quantum physicist leading the Super-Kamiokande to monitor the neutrinos emitted by mahjong activities. He discovered the secrets of Super Aryan Hitler's \\"Heisenburg Strike\\", a devastating move that merges parallel worlds through quantum superpositioning, making one win count as eight consecutive wins, a pƒÅrenchan (ÂÖ´ÈÄ£Ëçò). ; :Three blind itako residing in the sacred Mount Osore, able to channel dead spirits onto themselves as spirit media. Sought by the Japanese government to find a way to defeat Hitler, the itako summoned the three mahjong greats of the Yalta Conference who defeated Hitler in the past: Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Josef Stalin. The itako's life energies gave out after accomplishing this feat and died. ; :A young woman working for JAXA who handled all communications to and from the moon during Koizumi's match with Hitler through ASIMO. After demonstrating her determination against JAXA being scrapped, she played alongside Reiji Inui in the match against Renh≈ç. Despite knowing nothing about mahjong beforehand, she compensated by speedreading mahjong guide books and used her intellect to devastating effect during the match. ; :Humanoid robot created by Honda in 2000. It appears as Koizumi's partner in his match with Hitler and Tristan on the Fourth Reich's moon base. It has the ability to change the appearance of tiles using a holographic projector, among other \\"ASIMO weapons.\\"The Legend of Koizumi, Chapter 38.

Her character is based on Noriko Sakai. =United States of America= ; :The 43rd President of the United States, a gambling prodigy since his days in Texas. A man who believes that the ends justify the means. During a game of mahjong against Koizumi in a Japan-U.S. summit in Okinawa, where the stakes are an F-15 Eagle for every 1000 points, Bush suffered a humiliating defeat despite ganging up on Koizumi 3-on-1. He played Koizumi again in Dallas with his father, but lost again. His moves include \\"Patriot Tsumo\\" and \\"Bush Doctrine Riichi\\". He is voiced by Nobuo Tobita in the anime adaptation. ; :The 41st President of the United States, often referred to as \\"Papa Bush\\". In his mind, he was disgraced by the Japanese twice: the first is when he was being shot down above Ogasawara in World War II, the second is when his son was defeated in Okinawa on the mahjong table. He summoned Koizumi to the Texas Schoolbook Depository in Dallas (by kidnapping Taiz≈ç) in order to settle the score with mahjong. In the end, he sacrificed himself to save his son from dying at the mahjong table against Skorzeny. His special move is the \\"Apocalypse Now Ron\\" (where \\"ron\\" is winning by picking a discard). He is voiced by Tessh≈ç Genda in the anime adaptation. ; :The former United States Secretary of State. He utilized the advanced technologies of the United States to catch people cheating in mahjong.

A rogue who uses underhanded tactics to ensure his own victory, such as attempting to assassinate his opponent Koizumi in order to incapacitate him.

His special move is the \\"Democratic People's Riichi\\", where he declares riichi while discarding a north tile. He was blown overboard the USS George H.W. Bush by jet engine exhausts after his loss and had most of his body eaten by sharks, but he returned as a mechanical cyborg. He is voiced by Misugi Ootori in the anime. ; :The eldest son of General Kim. He replaces the anonymous North Korean official for the mahjong match on the USS George H.W. Bush for the OVA.

He is voiced by Wataru Takagi. =Russian Federation= ; :The second President of Russia who rose from being a KGB officer. A stoic man who mastered judo and sambo, and hid needles in his hands. He came to Japan to play mahjong with the members of the Japanese Diet as part of a Russo-Japanese Summit, sending Japan into massive debt with his winning streak. Special moves include \\"Kolkhoz Riichi\\" and the \\"Baltic Fleet\\" (Four quads of bamboo tiles, worth 1,583,296,743,997,800 points in total because they were playing without point limits) as well as the \\"Siberian Express Ron\\". He is voiced by J≈çji Nakata in the anime adaptation. ; :Third Russian President, playing a secondary position to Putin in the match against Wagner.

Though a loyal officer himself, he is not able to comprehend Medvedev's act of self- sacrifice. ; :The demonic doctor otherwise known as the \\"Angel of Death\\". An overall perfectionist who has a deep fascination with twins and the medical sciences.

Education and career After receiving an education on Academy of Fine Arts in Belgrade and specialization of animation in Zagreb, he started authoring animated films for TV Skopje from 1963‚Äì1968. He was the author of the first Macedonian animated film titled \\"Embrion ‚Ññ M\\". He was a leading representative of contemporary Macedonian animation, which is awarded at festivals in Berlin, Oberhausen, New York. Prior to his shift cinema, he was one of the pioneers of Yugoslav comics in the 1950s and a technical animator mostly working within the prestigious Zagreb-centered circle of animators. He created several movies, a number of technique-experimental unaccounted footage and left two unfinished projects designed under auspices of the production house \\"Vardar Film\\". The hallmarks of his movies, all of which are technically authored with polychromatic, predominantly biomorph shapes in recurring and subdued patterns, constituted a unique and recognizable style. Thematically the movies express universal combined mythical themes (birth, fall of man, apocalypse, phoenix), through broad ranges of visual allegories and metaphors. In some of authors works, documentary sequences were embedded, in line with symbolic augmentation of script's leitmotiv, rather than for reasons of visual appeal or exploration of technical limits.

Star boys. Children singing Christmas carols. Star singers also known as Epiphany singers, or Star boys' singing procession (England), are children and young people walking from house to house with a star on a rod and often wearing crowns and dressed in clothes to resemble the Three Magi (variously also known as Three Kings or Three Wise Men). The singing processions have their roots in an old medieval ecclesiastical play, centred on the Biblical Magi of the Christmas story in the Gospel of Matthew (Mt 2,1-28), appropriate to Epiphany. It is observed usually during the period between 27 December and 6 January (the feast of the Epiphany). In Scandinavia and Central Europe a special set of songs, distinct from Christmas carols has developed in this context. In England, the liturgical drama developed from being performed by cathedral schoolboys in the 16th century to become a more secular mystery drama, containing also some ordinary Christmas songs and carols. Historically performed by boys and male adolescents only, it is nowadays performed by children and young people of both sexes in most regions where the tradition is alive. Star boys and angels singing carols in church during Christmas and Epiphany in Sanok, Poland 2013  History  At a synod in Konstanz in Germany at Christmas in 1417 the British clergies performed the Star boy drama for the rest of the participants at the meeting. They wore expensive costumes and had a large shining star.Alv S. Hvidbergskaar: May the star come in? [Manuscript from a speech in the Norwegian Radio NRK on 3. January 1953], p. 6-7, op. cit. in Edvardsen 1993, p. 109. The performance was a huge success at the church conference and could have been one of the main reasons for growing popularity of the drama in post-medieval Europe. The importance of the Twelfth Day and the feast of the Epiphany grew with the introduction of the Gregorian calendar as the day, according to the earlier Julian calendar, is also the Old Christmas Day. After the Reformation in the 16th century, pupils of the cathedral schools in Protestant nations conducted these processions to raise funds to replace the church support that had disappeared. The custom passed further on to the general populace as a kind of narrative folk drama, but seems to have declined in its original form since the late 19th century. Since then the singing procession has become common in many parts of Europe (both in Catholic and Protestant areas) and in Russia. In most countries it is no longer restricted to boys, but children or both sexes participate. In Germany, Austria and Belgium organisations centrally organise the processions, collecting money for charity or international aid projects, leading to a widespread support of the custom. In Ukraine (1880, during the existence of Russian Empire)  Central Europe  Epiphany singers are received by Germany's Federal President Karl Carstens in Bonn 1 December 1982. The poster reads: \\"Dreik√∂nigssingen 1983 AMANI. Damit Kinder heute leben k√∂nnen\\". In Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria the Epiphany singing is performed at or close to Epiphany (January 6) and has developed into a nationwide custom, where the children of both sexes call on every door and are given sweets and money for charity projects - mostly in aid of poorer children in other countries.http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Dec2000/Feature1.asp A tradition in most of Central Europe involves writing a blessing above the main door of the home. For instance if the year is 2014, it would be \\"20 * C + M + B + 14\\". The initials refer to the Latin phrase \\"Christus mansionem benedicat\\" (= May Christ bless this house); folkloristically the letters are often interpreted as the names of the Three Wise Men (Caspar, Melchior, Balthasar). In Catholic parts of Germany and in Austria, this is done by the Sternsinger (literally \\"Star singers\\"). After having sung their songs, recited a poem, and collected donations for children in poorer parts of the world, they will chalk the blessing on the top of the door frame or place a sticker with the blessing. = In Germany = Annually around 300 000 people are active in collecting donations in Germany. = In Austria = In Austria the biggest carol singing campaign is organized by the \\"DKA\\" (Dreik√∂nigsaktion), an aid foundation founded by the youth organization Katholische Jungschar. Annually about 85,000 children and 30,000 adults take part in the \\"Dreik√∂nigsaktion\\".Homepage of DKA: About us Star singers in Vienna, Austria. = In Slovakia = The biggest carol singing campaign in Slovakia is Dobr√° Novina (English: \\"Good News\\"). It is also one of the biggest charity campaigns by young people in the country. Dobr√° Novina is organized by the youth organization eRko.cf. also Janƒçoviƒç, J, Fialov√°, Z and O‚ÄôMullane, M (2015) 'Development Education at University Level in Slovakia: Experiences and Challenges', Vol. 20, Spring, pp. 166-185.  England and Scotland  The Star singers, aged about ten to fifteen, are dressed in long white shirts and pointed brown or white paper hats, in imitation of a well-known picture of the Biblical Magi as Babylonians Balthazar carries the star and Caspar and Melchior are armed with wooden swords. The other characters usually do not disguise themselves but also dress in long shirts, often in brown, green or grey colours and conical hats. Joseph has got a cylindrical paper hat and a wooden timber or broad axe. King Herod wears a crown and he and his soldiers carry wooden swords.Neither the star play nor the costumes have however anything to do with the Plough Monday mummers in England as suggested by Kathleen Stokker 2000, p. 109. In the crowd there may also be shepherds with long shirts and sticks and some angels with white shirts and wings. The Star singers walk about from house to house \\"singing at the doors, with a star on a pole\\".Laurits B√∏dker 1965, p. 288. The dramatic part is introduced by one of the Wise Men knocking on someone's door asking: \\"May the star come in?\\" If the offer is accepted, they are all invited inside. Then the whole procession will enter the home singing a special Christmas carol. Then the play begins. In the performance, the Three Wise Men, Gaspar, Melchior and Balthazar, are first confronted by Joseph, who tries to protect the newborn baby Jesus (a doll) and his wife Mary from the intruders with a wooden axe. The three magi are however most welcome inside after saying that they have brought with them presents for the child. The Wise Men also have to mislead King Herod, who is also trying to find the new born 'prince' in the stable. Both Gaspar and Melchior fight the king and his men with swords, together with Joseph who uses his broad axe, while Mary nurses her son and Balthazar takes care of the shining star. After the performance Judas comes to collect money or other gifts from the audience in a large bag. The boys and girls are usually treated to drinks and cakes afterwards. Then the Star singers leave the house for their next visit to somewhere in the neighbourhood, singing a song containing a farewell and many thanks for the received gifts. The star itself is made anew each year, using transparent paper on a constructed frame built of wooden lists and with one to three candles placed inside. The star on the rod has to be movable and turned around all the time, so that the paper does not get overheated and does not go up in flame. The Star boys' singing procession in England seems later to have been mixed together with several other kinds of carol singers at Christmas. They do not go from house to house, but visit two or three local pubs to receive free beer. Nowadays they are not carrying the shining star anymore, but just a quadrangular paraffin wax on a long stick or even a candle lamp with an ordinary handle.Edvardsen 1993, p. 109-110. Refers to oral information collected from British theatre director Nadine Baylis, in Haddenham (Buckinghamshire), and from Tove Gaarder, who grew up in the mining town Sunderland. Whereas religious folk plays are the norm in the rest of Europe, the British folk drama is absolutely secular, even if they are mostly taking place on the Christian festival days.  \\"Stjernespill\\" in Scandinavia and Finland  Finnish Star boys (tiernapojat) in Oulu, 1919. In the Nordic countries the Star boys' singing procession is known all along the coast, though not often in inland communities. At the end of the 1880s many objected to this Catholic form of organised begging, and officials began forbidding the practice. By the 1900s it had largely disappeared, and there are now just a few places where the original play of the Star boys can be counted as an unbroken linear tradition, for instance the islands Amager in Denmark, and Haram and Vigra on the west coast of Norway, but the most famous one is probably the Star boys' singing procession in the small town of Grimstad on the south coast of Norway.The Grimstad custom is encouraged by local people of influence ‚Äì journalists, teachers and local historians ‚Äì who train the new boys and maintain standards. However, the grown ups also prevent changes in the tradition. = Sweden = In 19th century the Swedish Star boys started to join in with horse riding on St. Stephen's Day, 26 December. The tradition of Star boys (sometimes even with Judas Iscariot), singing and acting about Christmas, Saint Stephen and Epiphany, has traditionally been performed from St. Stephen's Day until Epiphany. Today they are only to be seen bringing up the rear together with bridesmaids and elves as a part of the Lucia procession on December 13. Recently school teachers, nursery nurses and Christian clergymen have tried to revitalize the play for small children, inviting their parents to come to the schools, the kindergartens or the churches to see it performed. But the popular and more humorous folkloristic elements of the play are often left out. = Finland = In Finland, a version of the Star boys' procession originating in the city of Oulu, a musical play known as Tiernapojat, has become established as a cherished Christmas tradition nationwide.

It was first recorded by the Pittsburgh vocal group The Tempos. This first version peaked at #23 in the summer of 1959. The most popular take on \\"See You In September\\" was by The Happenings in 1966, which reached #3. Background Sid Wayne would recall the song's inception: \\"I was in the habit of going from my home on Long Island every day to Brill Building, on Tin Pan Alley [to] meet with different songwriters there. We'd eat at Jack Dempsey's or The Turf Restaurant and then we'd go up to one of the publishers' offices and work in the piano room. We'd sit around saying to each other, 'What do you want to write today? A hit or a standard?'\\" At 11 a.m. on a Friday in June 1959 Wayne thus met up with Sherman Edwards: \\"he said, 'What do you want to write?' 'I'd like to write a song called See You in September,\\"' I said. We talked it back and forth and I think I may have contributed part of the opening music, but with Sherman it didn't matter, because he could throw me back half the lyric ‚Äî that's how he worked. I think probably by two in the afternoon we got the song finished. It needed to be written; it was like boiling inside of us.\\" By 4:30 p.m. that day, Wayne and Edwards had reworked their composition, simplifying it so as to appeal to the teen demographic, and proceeded to make the rounds of publishers to pitch the song which, after one rejection, met with an enthusiastic reception from Jack Gold, owner of the local Paris label; by 8 p.m. he had telephoned the Tempos1 in their hometown of Pittsburgh. The group had been flown into New York City by the next day, Saturday. Sid Wayne: \\"By Monday the record was cut [with the Billy Mure orchestra], test pressings were Thursday, and by Friday the song was played on WNEW in New York. The thing took off like wildfire‚Ä¶ Five hundred dollars to split between the two of us [ie. Wayne & Edwards]‚Ä¶ was a damn good week's pay in 1961.\\" In fact, the Tempos' \\"See You in September\\" failed to become a hit in the New York City area and despite breaking in San Francisco in June 1959, the single did not reach the national charts until that July. Despite a subsequent swift ascent of the Billboard Hot 100, the single's momentum fell sharply at the end of August 1959 with a resultant #23 peak. Although overshadowed by the Happenings' #3 remake, the Tempos' version of \\"See You in September\\" did gain considerable currency in 1973 by virtue of its inclusion on the American Graffiti soundtrack. *Mike Lazo (top tenor), Jim Drake, Tom Monito, Gene SchachterBillboard, 12 October 1959, p. 20 The Happenings version Bob Miranda of the Happenings recalls that he and the other members of the group considered the original version of \\"See You in September\\", which was \\"sort of a slow Cha-Cha [to be] a great song and kind of a bad record. We always looked for that. If you want to revise something and put your own sound to it, I think you should look for a great song that was not a great record.\\" Recorded in the spring of 1966, the Happenings' version of \\"See You in September\\" was produced by Bob Crewe for the B.T. Puppy label, though the label credits the producer to \\"Bright Tunes Productions.\\" The song's arrangement‚Äîby Herb Bernstein‚Äîrecalled both the recordings of the Tokens (who owned B. T. Puppy) and the Four Seasons. Breaking out in Boston, where the track reached the Top Ten that June, \\"See You in September\\" accrued enough national support to enter the Billboard Hot 100 that July to reach that chart's Top Ten the third week of August 1966. Despite peaking at #3 the first week of September 1966, the single had enough staying power to remain in the Top Ten throughout the rest of the month. That December, the Happenings were awarded a Gold disc for \\"See You in September\\"'s selling a million units. The single became a hit in Brazil, appearing at #1 on the chart for Rio de Janeiro in January 1967. In June 1967 the Happenings were invited to participate in the Sanremo Music Festival, where they performed it in Italian as \\"Aria de settembre\\". Other versions During the period between the original recording of \\"See You in September\\" by the Tempos in 1959 and the #3 hit version by the Happenings in 1966, the song was remade in classic doo-wop style by the Quotations in April 1962; according to Quotations member Harvey Hersh: \\"Verve [the group's label] released the record in August which pretty much destroyed any chance of air play.\\" 1962 also saw a version of the song on the album The Things We Did Last Summer by Shelley Fabares. In 1963, Bobby Rydell recorded the song for his album Wild (Wood) Days. Also in 1963, the Chiffons recorded a version of the song for their He's So Fine album; the track was reprised on their 1966 Sweet Talkin' Guy album. Mike Clifford had a September 1964 single release of the song but as the B-side of the non-charter \\"One By One The Roses Died\\". In the UK, where the Happenings' single was released on Fontana Records in August 1966 and fell short of UK Singles Chart, \\"See You in September\\" was recorded the same month by The Symbols, a male quartet from East London signed by Edward Kassner of President Records specifically to cover the Happenings' hit. Featuring Keith Mansfield on orchestral arrangement/conducting duties, the Symbols' version reached #19 on the Radio London Fab 40, without ranking on the UK Singles Chart. Distribution problems reportedly also factoring into its lack of chart impact, although the Symbols remained with President providing the label with successful remakes of older American hits \\"Bye Bye Baby\\" and \\"The Best Part of Breaking Up\\"; and their guitarist, Mick Clarke, would be a founding member of The Rubettes. \\"See You in September\\" was also recorded by Gerry and the Pacemakers. In 1966, in Hong Kong, this song was recorded by local pop group Teddy Robin and the Playboys on their LP album Not All Lies!. In 1972, a remake of the song by the Mike Curb Congregation reached #15 on Billboard's Easy Listening chart. Julie Budd also remade it that year, with her version successful enough in Argentina to justify a South American tour in the spring of 1973. In 1973, the band California recorded a remake of the song for Laurie Records. California was led by Beatlemania (musical) cast member Les Fradkin. The single also featured members of the 1960s Baroque pop group The Left Banke. In August 1979, a version by Debby Boone was issued as a single to coincide with the release of the Debby Boone album (which did not feature \\"See You in September\\"). This version charted at #41 C&W; and #45 Adult Contemporary. Also in 1979 Cisse (fi) remade \\"See You in September\\" for his Summer Party album. In November 1966, Olivier Despax (fr) recorded a French-language version of the song in London for release on Barclay Records. That same year the Spanish rendering \\"Te ver√© en septiembre\\" was recorded by both Marta Baiz√°n and Kinita, while 1967 saw the release of an alternate Spanish performance \\"Setembre Est√° Lonxe\\", recorded by Jacinta. Use in popular culture In 1988, the song was used in a commercial for Roy Rogers Restaurants that depicted school cafeteria personnel holding up trays of unappetizing school lunches. This commercial was later pulled off the air after real life school cafeteria personnel complained that the advertisement was demeaning to their profession.

Musaoglu is a member of the Union of the Azerbaijan Cinematographers and the Union of Turkish Documentary Cinematographers, and a founder of the Society for Support of the Development of Documentary Films and Authorial Programs. Early life Although Musaoglu's father, Musa Guliyev, was a professor of historical sciences, Musaoglu spent his youth in the villages of Azerbaijan where he made theatrical performances with other youths often accepting fruit in lieu of payment. In 2004 he established RITM Production Company together with his co-workers. The company produced documentaries, short films and The 40th Door, which was the first full-length feature film in the history of RITM Production Company as well as the film director and script writer Elchin Musaoglu. Peter Debruge from Variety said: The 40th Door' is no Hollywood-style rags-to-riches tale, offering instead a stripped-down neorealist fable in the vein of Vittorio De Sica and the strong Iranian films of a decade ago.

Health behavior change refers to a replacement of health- compromising behaviors (such as sedentary behavior) by health-enhancing behaviors (such as physical exercise). To describe, predict, and explain such processes, theories or models are being developed. Health behavioural change theories are designed to examine a set of psychological constructs that jointly aim at explaining what motivates people to change and how they take preventive action.Conner, M., & Norman, P. (Eds.). (2005). Predicting health behavior: Research and practice with social cognition models (2nd ed.). Buckingham, England: Open University Press.Sniehotta, F. F. (2009). Towards a theory of intentional behaviour change: Plans, planning, and self-regulation. British Journal of Health Psychology, 14, 261‚Äì273. HAPA is an open framework of various motivational and volitional constructs that are assumed to explain and predict individual changes in health behaviors such as quitting smoking or drinking, and improving physical activity levels, dental hygiene, seat belt use, breast self-examination, dietary behaviors,Biddle, S. J. H., & Fuchs, R. (2009). Exercise psychology: A view from Europe. Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 10, 410‚Äì419. and avoiding drunk driving. HAPA suggests that the adoption, initiation, and maintenance of health behaviors should be conceived of as a structured process including a motivation phase and a volition phase. The former describes the intention formation while the latter refers to planning, and action (initiative, maintenance, recovery). The model emphasizes the particular role of perceived self-efficacy at different stages of health behavior change.Sutton, S. (2005). Stage models of health behaviour. In M. Conner & P. Norman (Eds.), Predicting health behaviour: Research and practice with social cognition models (2nd ed., pp. 223‚Äì275). Maidenhead, England: Open University Press. Background Models that describe health behavior change can be distinguished in terms of the assumption whether they are continuum- based or stage-based.Lippke, S., & Ziegelmann, J. P. (2008). Theory-based health behavior change: Developing, testing and applying theories for evidence-based interventions. Applied Psychology: International Review, 57, 698‚Äì716. A continuum (mediator) model claims that change is a continuous process that leads from lack of motivation via action readiness either to successful change or final disengagement. Research on such mediator models are reflected by path diagrams that include distal and proximal predictors of the target behavior. On the other hand, the stage approach assumes that change is non-linear and consists of several qualitative steps that reflect different mindsets of people. A two-layer framework that can be applied either as a continuum or as a stage model is HAPA.Schwarzer, R. (2008). Modeling health behavior change: How to predict and modify the adoption and maintenance of health behaviors. Applied Psychology: An International Review, 57(1), 1‚Äì29. It includes self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and risk perception as distal predictors, intention as a middle-level mediator, and volitional factors (such as action planning) as the most proximal predictors of behavior. See Self- efficacy. Good intentions are more likely to be translated into action when people plan when, where, and how to perform the desired behavior. Intentions foster planning, which in turn facilitates behavior change. Planning was found to mediate the intention-behavior relation.Gollwitzer, P. M., & Sheeran, P. (2006). Implementation intentions and goal achievement: A meta-analysis of effects and processes. Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 38, 69‚Äì119. A distinction has been made between action planning and coping planning. Coping planning takes place when people imagine scenarios that hinder them to perform their intended behavior, and they develop one or more plans to cope with such a challenging situation.Scholz, U., Sch√ºz, B., Ziegelmann, J. P., Lippke, S., & Schwarzer, R. (2008). Beyond behavioural intentions: Planning mediates between intentions and physical activity. British Journal of Health Psychology, 13, 479‚Äì494. HAPA is designed as a sequence of two continuous self-regulatory processes, a goal-setting phase (motivation) and a goal- pursuit phase (volition). The second phase is subdivided into a pre-action phase and an action phase. Thus, one can superimpose these three phases (stages) on the continuum (mediator) model as a second layer, and regard the stages as moderators. This two-layer architecture allows to switch between the continuum model and the stage model, depending on the given research question. Five principles HAPA has five major principles that make it distinct from other models. Principle 1: Motivation and volition. The first principle suggests that one should divide the health behavior change process into two phases. There is a switch of mindsets when people move from deliberation to action. First comes the motivation phase in which people develop their intentions. Afterwards, they enter the volition phase. Principle 2: Two volitional phases. In the volition phase there are two groups of individuals: those who have not yet translated their intentions into action, and those who have. There are inactive as well as active persons in this phase. In other words, in the volitional phase one finds intenders as well as actors who are characterized by different psychological states. Thus, in addition to health behavior change as a continuous process, one can also create three categories of people with different mindsets depending on their current point of residence within the course of health behavior change: preintenders, intenders, and actors. The assessment of stages is done by behavior-specific stage algorithms.Lippke, S., Ziegelmann, J. P., Schwarzer, R., & Velicer, W. F. (2009). Validity of stage assessment in the adoption and maintenance of physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption. Health Psychology, 28, 183‚Äì193. Principle 3: Postintentional planning. Intenders who are in the volitional preactional stage are motivated to change, but do not act because they might lack the right skills to translate their intention into action. Planning is a key strategy at this point. Planning serves as an operative mediator between intentions and behavior. Principle 4: Two kinds of mental simulation. Planning can be divided into action planning and coping planning. Action planning pertains to the when, where, and how of intended action. Coping planning includes the anticipation of barriers and the design of alternative actions that help to attain one's goals in spite of the impediments. The separation of the planning construct into two constructs, action planning and coping planning, has been found useful as studies have confirmed the discriminant validity of such a distinction.Sniehotta, F. F., Schwarzer, R., Scholz, U., & Sch√ºz, B. (2005). Action planning and coping planning for long-term lifestyle change: Theory and assessment. European Journal of Social Psychology, 35, 565‚Äì576. Action planning seems to be more important for the initiation of health behaviors, whereas coping planning is required for the initiation and maintenance of actions as well.Sniehotta, F. F., Scholz, U., & Schwarzer, R. (2006). Action plans and coping plans for physical exercise: A longitudinal intervention study in cardiac rehabilitation. British Journal of Health Psychology, 11, 23‚Äì37. Principle 5: Phase-specific self-efficacy. Perceived self-efficacy is required throughout the entire process. However, the nature of self-efficacy differs from phase to phase. This difference relates to the fact that there are different challenges as people progress from one phase to the next one. Goal setting, planning, initiation, action, and maintenance pose challenges that are not of the same nature. Therefore, one should distinguish between preactional self-efficacy, coping self-efficacy, and recovery self-efficacy.Luszczynska, A., Mazurkiewicz, M., Ziegelmann J. P., & Schwarzer, R. (2007). Recovery self- efficacy and intention as predictors of running or jogging behavior: A cross- lagged panel analysis over a two-year period. Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 8, 247‚Äì260. Sometimes the terms task self-efficacy instead of preaction self-efficacy, and maintenance self-efficacy instead of coping and recovery self-efficacy are preferred. Psychological interventions When it comes to the design of interventions, one can consider identifying individuals who reside either at the motivational stage or the volitional stage.Sch√ºz, B., Sniehotta, F. F., & Schwarzer, R. (2007). Stage-specific effects of an action control intervention on dental flossing. Health Education Research, 22, 332‚Äì341. Then, each group becomes the target of a specific treatment that is tailored to this group. Moreover, it is theoretically meaningful and has been found useful to subdivide further the volitional group into those who perform and those who only intend to perform. In the postintentional preactional stage, individuals are labeled \\"intenders\\", whereas in the actional stage they are labeled \\"actors\\". Thus, a suitable subdivision within the health behavior change process yields three groups: nonintenders, intenders, and actors.Luszczynska, A., Tryburcy, M., & Schwarzer, R. (2007). Improving fruit and vegetable consumption: A self-efficacy intervention compared to a combined self-efficacy and planning intervention. Health Education Research, 22, 630‚Äì638. The term \\"stage\\" in this context was chosen to allude to the stage theories, but not in the strict definition that includes irreversibility and invariance. The terms \\"phase\\" or \\"mindset\\" may be equally suitable for this distinction. The basic idea is that individuals pass through different mindsets on their way to behavior change. Thus, interventions may be most efficient when tailored to these particular mindsets. For example, nonintenders are supposed to benefit from confrontation with outcome expectancies and some level of risk communication.Schwarzer, R., Cao, D. S., & Lippke, S. (2010). Stage-matched minimal interventions to enhance physical activity in Chinese adolescents. Journal of Adolescent Health, 47, 533‚Äì539. . They need to learn that the new behavior (e.g., becoming physically active) has positive outcomes (e.g., well-being, weight loss, fun) as opposed to the negative outcomes that accompany the current (sedentary) behavior (such as developing an illness or being unattractive). In contrast, intenders should not benefit from such a treatment because, after setting a goal, they have already moved beyond this mindset. Rather, they should benefit from planning to translate their intentions into action.Wiedemann, A. U., Sch√ºz, B., Sniehotta, F.F., Scholz, U., & Schwarzer, R. (2009). Disentangling the relation between intentions, planning, and behaviour: A moderated mediation analysis. Psychology & Health, 24 (1), 67‚Äì79. Finally, actors do not need any treatment at all unless one wants to improve their relapse prevention skills. Then, they should be prepared for particular high-risk situations in which lapses are imminent. Preparation can be exercised by teaching them to anticipate such situations and by acquiring the necessary levels of perceived recovery self-efficacy. There are quite a few randomized controlled trials that have examined the notion of stage-matched interventions based on HAPA, for example in the context of dietary behaviors,Wiedemann, A. U., Lippke, S., Reuter, T., Sch√ºz, B., Ziegelmann, J. P., & Schwarzer, R. (2009). Prediction of stage transitions in fruit and vegetable intake.

He is credited with 33 confirmed aerial victories, all claimed over the Western theatre of operations, and claimed a further 19 unconfirmed kills in over 2,000 flights. His total included 19 heavy bombers of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF).Knoke, 1997, p. 191  Early life  He was born the son of a policeman on 24 March 1921 in Hamelin. On 6 July 1938, whilst watching an air display, Knoke made his first flight, a fifteen-minute joy ride in an old transport aircraft and took the preliminary examination for entry into the Luftwaffe. On 15 November 1939, Knoke underwent flight training at No. 11 Flying Training Regiment Schonwald, near Berlin and in August 1940 attended Jagdfliegerschule 1 (Werneuchen) under instructor Flight Sergeant Kuhl, an experienced operational pilot who had already seen action in both the invasions of Poland and France.  War career 1941-42  In early 1941 Knoke received his first combat posting, joining Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG 52). Posted to II Gruppe under Hauptmann Erich Woitke, his comrades included the future aces Gerhard Barkhorn, G√ºnther Rall and Walter Krupinski. After initial operations during the invasion of Soviet Russia in June 1941, Knoke was transferred to JG 1 in July 1941. On 28 August 1941 Heinz married Elisabeth \\"Lilo\\" Makowski in Schieratz. In February 1942, Knoke participated with 3./JG 1 in Operation Donnerkeil, the Channel Dash of the German battleships and and heavy cruiser . On 14 February 1942 Knoke was detached to Jagdgruppe Losigkeit (Fritz Losigkeit), where he was charged with the air protection of these ships over the Norway coast. He returned to JG 1 in March. On 5 March he shared in shooting down a Royal Air Force (RAF) Supermarine Spitfire of No. 1 Photo Reconnaissance Unit (PRU), RAF. Its pilot, Flight Lieutenant ADM Gunn, was taken prisoner. In October 1942 Knoke became Commanding officer of 2nd Staffel, JG 1. He claimed his solo first kill on 31 October, an RAF Bristol Blenheim.  Against the USAAF 1943-44  As the USAAF daylight bomber offensive increased steadily in intensity throughout 1943, so operations by the defending JG 1 and JG 11 grew in proportion. Knoke destroyed his first 'heavy' on his 164th operation: Maisie, a B-24 Liberator of the 44th Bombardment Group, which he shot down over Zwischenahn on 26 February 1943 - two of the crew survived.'Battles with the Luftwaffe'; Boiten & Bowman, 2001, page 29 Journalist Robert Post who on the first and last mission of \\"The Writing 69th\\", was also among those killed. The problem of attacking heavily armed bombers effectively occupied the minds of the Luftwaffe in early 1943. Oberleutnant Heinz Knoke and his friend, Leutnant Dieter Gerhardt (killed in action against B-24s on 18 March 1943), developed the idea of aerial bombing as a means to break up the tight combat boxes, thereby compromising the defensively strong USAAF bomber formations. Knoke claimed his fifth victory, a B-24 of the 93rd Bomb Group on 18 March over Helgoland. On 22 March, Knoke successfully downed the B-17 Flying Fortress Liberty Bell, of the 91st Bombardment Group, with a 250 kg bomb, intercepting its return flight after attacking Wilhelmshaven. The B-17 fell into the North Sea west of Helgoland; all of the crew were killed.Weal, 1999, p. 53. He thus became the first of very few fighter pilots in aviation history to destroy an enemy aircraft with a bomb. The Luftwaffe soon curtailed this practice, however as the carriage of bombs severely affected high altitude performance of the Messerschmitt Bf 109G and also made these aircraft vulnerable to any escorting fighters. In April 1943 I./JG 1 became II gruppe of the newly formed Jagdgeschwader 11 (JG 11), Knoke's 2 Staffel becoming 5./JG 11. During 1943 Knoke claimed some 17 kills, the majority B-17s and B-24s of the USAAF. Another B-17 (of the 95th Bomb Group) was downed on 11 June. Later that month, (on the 25th), Knoke was wounded in the hand by return fire from a bomber, resulting in the amputation of part of his thumb. On 17 August 1943 while intercepting the raid on Regensburg he was again wounded, this time by shrapnel fragments and his aircraft damaged by bomber return fire. Knoke belly landed near Bonn, his Bf 109G-6 was written off. On 27 September 1943 Knoke shot down a B-17, Elusive Elcy, of the 94th Bomb group using Werfer-Granate 21 unguided rockets launched from modified mortar tubes. Encountering the USAAF escort fighters for the first time, he also destroyed a P-47 Thunderbolt of the 56th Fighter Group flown by Lieutenant H. P. Dugas, who was killed. Knoke was then shot down by other P-47s and had to bail out. Knoke was brought down again on 4 October that same year. After shooting down a B-24 of the 392nd Bombardment Group in a frontal attack, he was hit by the dorsal gunner's fire and Knoke bailed out of his damaged fighter into the bitterly cold North Sea. Covered by aircraft of his unit, Knoke managed to climb into an inflatable raft dropped by a Focke- Wulf Weihe. He was rescued two hours later by a lifeboat. Knoke claimed his 18th victory on 10 October 1943, a B-17, although his 109G was hit by P-47s and 75% damaged, forcing him to land at Twente in the Netherlands. Knoke was again shot down on 4 January 1944. On 10 February Gruppenkommandeur G√ºnther Specht was wounded and Knoke became acting commander of II./JG 11. On 4 March Knoke was leading II./JG 11, when he was involved in the decimation of the 363rd Fighter Group. In a surprise attack on some 60 P-51 Mustangs over Hamburg, the USAAF lost 12 P-51s in a single action, Knoke claiming one himself. From 15 to 20 April 1944, Knoke was attached to the Experimental Station at Lechfeld in Bavaria, where he flew the Messerschmitt Me 262A jet fighter for the first time. Knoke was promoted to the rank of Hauptmann (Captain), on 28 April 1944, for \\"bravery in the face of the enemy\\", and made Gruppenkommandeur of II./ JG 11. At 23 years of age Knoke was, at the time, the youngest Gruppenkommandeur in the Luftwaffe. Knoke was shot down on 29 April in action against the P-47 of Captain James Cannon of the 354th Fighter Group and was hospitalised until August 1944 with severe concussion. Before he bailed out, Knoke managed in turn to shoot down the overshooting 'Jug' piloted by Capt. Cannon, who was taken prisoner. Knoke claimed to have had some friendly interactions with Cannon before both being picked up by German forces. Upon returning to base, Knoke develops a heavy fever and what later turns out to be a dangerous brain hemorrhage. Following this he has a complete nervous breakdown, grounding him until the middle of August.  Normandy 1944  Still recovering from his wounds, Knoke was then transferred on 13 August 1944 to command III./ JG 1. Operating over the Normandy front, Knoke claimed a P-47 over R√¢nes, southeast of Argentan on 14 August, (of the 358th Fighter Group, piloted by 2nd Lieutenant. S.A. Giamalva, who was killed) and another the next day. On 16 August he claimed a Spitfire near √âtampes. A P-38 Lightning of the 31st Photo Squadron (Lieutenant. T.L. Wood, who was killed), was shot down on the 17th, followed by an unconfirmed B-26 Marauder later the same day. Two P-51s were claimed on 18 August. On 25 August another P-51 of the 354th Fighter Group was claimed, but Knoke was shot down during the engagement. Bailing out behind the fluidly moving front line, Knoke was almost captured by French Maquis forces. Shooting his way clear, Knoke managed to regain the German lines and returned safely to his unit. By the end of August 1944 III./ JG 1 had almost been wiped out in the air battles over the Western Front; Knoke was ordered to move the unit to Fels am Wagram, prior to its transfer back to Germany for reinforcement and re-equipment. Given orders to then transfer III./JG 1 to Vienna, Hauptmann Knoke was seriously injured in the legs by a Partisan-planted land mine during a car journey near Prague on 9 October 1944. In March 1945, while still on crutches, Knoke became the officer commanding at Jever air base. He also oversaw the work on defensive fortifications around Wilhelmshaven. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) on 27 April 1945. In September 1945 Heinz Knoke returned to civilian life.  Political career  In 1951 Heinz Knoke was elected to the legislature of Lower Saxony as a member of the Socialist Reich Party. Although the Supreme Court of the Federal Republic of Germany declared this party illegal in 1952, Knoke remained in politics as a member of the parish council of the Gemeinde Schortens (Gemeindeparlament) from April 1954. For several years he also worked as a Manager with the Jever Pilsener Brauhaus. He was a member of the Freie Demokratische Partei (FDP, Liberal Democratic Party), and was elected for the community parliament/parish parliament at the elections of October 1956, where he was returned to office in the March 1961, September 1964, and September 1968 elections. He retired in October 1972 and in the mid 1980s joined Osnabr√ºck University to study literature and philosophy.  Wartime writings  During the 1950s Knoke wrote a book about his wartime career entitled I Flew for the F√ºhrer, which was published by C. Boesendahl in 1952 (an English version was initially published in 1953). The book became an aviation classic, as one of the first quality narratives to appear in the West as told by one of the Luftwaffe aces. His memoirs clearly show an initial enthusiasm for the war, but become more grim and demoralized beginning in 1944. In his last diary entries Knoke shows willingness to enter into an armistice with the Western Allies to continue the war, together, against the USSR.

It and the glasshead barreleye fish are the only vertebrates known to employ a mirror, in addition to a lens, to focus an image in its eyes.Smith, L. (January 8, 2009). \\"Fish with four eyes can see through the deep sea gloom\\". Times Online. Times Newspapers Ltd. Retrieved on March 14, 2009. This species probably has a worldwide tropical and temperate distribution; in the Atlantic Ocean it is known from Bermuda, the Bahamas, the Greater Antilles, and the Gulf of Mexico, and in the Pacific Ocean it is known from the California Current region and the South China Sea. It is found in the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones at a depth of , but usually occurs below . In the Gulf of Mexico it is found shallower, at . Description The body of D. longipes is slender, the depth 12.6‚Äì14.3% of the standard length. The head comprises 29-32.4% of the standard length, with a long, pointed snout. The eyes are cylindrical and face upward, with an accessory outgrowth to the side, and are covered with a silvery layer called the \\"argentea\\" for camouflage. The upper jaw is toothless, and there is a single row of small teeth in the lower jaw. There are 13 fin rays in the pectoral fins, 10‚Äì11 rays in the dorsal fin, 8‚Äì9 rays in the pelvic fins, and 8‚Äì9 rays in the anal fin. The pelvic fins are elongated, and there may be an adipose fin. The body is transparent, covered by thin scales. There are four pairs of blotches on the peritoneal cavity beneath the gut, a line of chromatophores below the lateral line to the position of dorsal fin, and two blotches on the base of the tail. The snout is dusky in color. The maximum known length is . Biology and ecology The diet of D. longipes consists primarily of copepods and other small crustaceans, though as food is scarce in the deep sea it may take anything it can catch. Reproduction is oviparous, with pelagic eggs and larvae. The larvoid juveniles and adults are covered in a gelatinous sheath. Flexion (the curvature of the notochord in the formation of the caudal fin) occurs at around a standard length of , and metamorphosis at a standard length of . The pectoral and pelvic fins form early, as does the stomach on the left side.Brownsnout spookfish. Alaska Fisheries Science Center: Ichthyoplankton Information System. July 2008. Retrieved on March 14, 2009. Adult D. longipes exhibit paedomorphic characteristics found in the juveniles of other opisthoproctids, such as poorly developed muscles (for example the lack of ventral muscles, meaning the gut is enclosed only by the peritoneum and the skin), rudimentary scales and coloration, and the placement of the pectoral and pelvic fins on peduncles that are not connected to the body by muscles. Developed gonads have been observed in a male and a female. Their lifespan is 5 years. =Eyes= The D. longipes eye. 1:Diverticulum with Retina (a) and Reflective crystals (b). 2:Main Eye with lens (c) and retina (d). D. longipes is unusual in that it uses both refractive and reflective optics in sight. The main tubular eye contains a lateral ovoid swelling called a \\"diverticulum\\", largely separated from the eye by a septum. The retina lines most of the interior of the eye, and there are two corneal openings, one directed up and the other down, that allow light into the main eye and the diverticulum respectively. The main eye employs a lens to focus its image, as in other fishes. However, inside the diverticulum the light is reflected and focused onto the retina by a curved composite mirror derived from the retinal tapetum, composed of many layers of small reflective plates possibly made of guanine crystals, acting as the reflector equivalent of a Fresnel lens.http://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/2014/03/double-duty-deep-sea- fish-eye-has-one-mirrored-and-one-refractive-lens-system.html The split structure of the D. longipes eye allows the fish to see both up and down at the same time. In addition, the mirror system is superior to a lens in gathering light. It is likely that the main eye serves to detect objects silhouetted against the sunlight, while the diverticulum serves to detect bioluminescent flashes from the sides and below.

These requirements are dependent on the country or other jurisdiction where the dentist is licensed and practicing. Some countries offer Board Certification in special needs dentistry, such as with the American Board of Special Care Dentistry (Diplomate) or the Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons (FRACDS (SND), Fellowship). The oral health therapist have incorporated studies to allow for their scope of practice to cover working with people with special needs. They may accompany a dentist with clinic or domiciliary environments to aid in education, disease control and maintenance of patients with special needs. Patients who require special needs dentistry form a diverse group, and may be found living at home, in hospital, in secure units, in residential or nursing homes, or they may be homeless or vulnerably housed. Their additional needs may be due directly to their impairment or disability, or to some aspect of their medical history that affects their oral health, or because their social, environmental or cultural context disables them with reference to their oral health.Dougall A. and Fiske J. (2008) Access to special care dentistry, British Dental Journal 204 pp 605-616 In Australia and New Zealand  The Australian Dental Council recognized the specialty of Special Needs Dentistry in November 2003. Among some of the first countries to establish Special Needs Dentistry as a speciality are Australia and New Zealand. There are now a number of training programs, within both countries, which have been established as pathways into this speciality. This move is advantageous for this area of dentistry, as the workforce is in high demand. Increased training and ongoing support is essential to encourage the provision of care to special needs patients in both conventional and unconventional settings. There are a number of established societies within Australia and New Zealand which provide resources for dental health and other allied health professionals and who advocate for the oral health of people with special needs. =Australian and New Zealand Academy of Special Needs Dentistry= This academy is a group of specialists who are registered as Special Needs Dental practitioners in both Australia and New Zealand. This organisation was developed with the intent to establish a network for those involved in Special Needs Dentistry in Australia and New Zealand. With the advancement of the speciality they intend to enhance the dental experience for those patients with special needs and through developments in research and advocacy their objective is to enrich these patients' overall quality of life.S. Liberali (personal communication, May 16, 2016) =Australian Society for Special Care in Dentistry (ASSCID)= The Australian Society of Special Care in Dentistry was formed in 1997 and currently has 65 representative members within each state and territory of Australia. The objectives of ASSCID include an oral health and special needs educational role for dental professionals and other allied health workers. They act as a resource hub for professionals to obtain information on the special needs patient and how best to formulate care plans. ASSCID supports the need for oral health services for those with special needs and aligns with health promotion programs that focus on people with special needs. =Australian and New Zealand Society of Paediatric Dentistry (ANZSPD)= The Australian and New Zealand Society of Paediatric Dentistry was established in 1988. It is a collaboration of two associations, the Australian Society of Dentistry for Children and the New Zealand Society of Dentistry for Children. The society aims to remain dedicated to the research and development of Paediatric Dentistry. The society also has a large focus on dental care for special needs children and avidly support oral health promotion. =Australasian Academy of Paediatric Dentistry (AAPD)= The Australasian Academy of Paediatric Dentistry was developed in 1990. Striving for the best possible oral health conditions for babies, children and adolescents, including those who have special needs, is one of their main objectives. =Dental Health Services Victoria (DHSV)= The principal public oral health organisation in Victoria, Australia, is Dental Health Services Victoria (DHSV). It was founded in 1996 and is a State Government funded initiative that delivers oral health care to Victorian citizens who fit the eligibility criteria. Regarding special needs, the DHSV provides clinical care to patients from the Special Care Unit at the Royal Dental Hospital of Melbourne, via two special dental vans and also through a domiciliary service. All children enrolled in special or special developmental schools both in urban and rural areas are presented with the opportunity for oral health care at no cost at one or two year intervals. In the United Kingdom Special Care Dentistry (SCD) is the thirteenth and most recent dental speciality to be approved by the United Kingdom General Dental Council (GDC). To date, there are 73 specialists on the GDC specialist list.General Dental Council, accessed 6 October 2009. NHS consultant posts in Special Care Dentistry have been set up in some areas of the United Kingdom. United Kingdom specialists in SCD, and dentists with a special interest in SCD, may work in NHS or private general practice, NHS community/salaried dental services or hospital dental services. People with impairments or disabilities who require Special Care Dentistry may seek a special care dentist by contacting their local healthcare provider (e.g. Primary Care Trust) or by obtaining a referral from, for example, their general medical or dental practitioner. Most SCD services have referral criteria which specify which groups of people they will accept for dental treatment. Specialist training programmes are currently being introduced across the United Kingdom to provide training in SCD, leading to admission onto the GDC specialist list. Postgraduate qualifications in SCD are available from institutions such as the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, University College London Eastman Dental Institute and King's College London Dental Institute.Specialist Advisory Committee in Special Care Dentistry (2007) Training Programme in Special Care Dentistry PDF There are also post-qualification courses available in SCD for Dental Care Professionals such as dental nurses, hygienists and therapists.  In the United States  While some countries, such as Australia and the UK, may require 3 years of post-doctoral training of dentists who want to specialize in dental care for the oral health of individuals with special needs conditions, the requirements in the United States are somewhat different. Not all dental schools in the United States offer extensive training in special care dentistry as part of their dental school curriculum. Therefore, dentists who want to treat patients with special needs conditions may choose to complete either a 1-year general practice residency (GPR) or advanced education in general dentistry (AEGD) residency program. A GPR program tends to be associated with a hospital and give the dentist the experience of treating patients with special care needs under general anesthesia. One such example of this specialized training is through Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Program, a Los Angeles County Hospital, in Downey, CA. Dentists in the United States are not obliged to complete formal post-doctoral residency training because it is not required by local, state, or national governing dental boards. There are various reasons why a dentist does not complete formal post-doctoral residency training, namely, it is not a requirement to practice general dentistry in the United States. However, dentists who desire to treat patients with special needs conditions can still do so with taking continuing education courses. One option to receive training and in-depth special care education is through the organization Special Care Dental Association (SCDA). This organization also offers American Board Certification in Special Care Dentistry. Whichever path is taken, extra study and training is warranted and beneficial when choosing to care for the oral health of patients with special care conditions.  International Societies International Association for Disability and Oral Health (iADH)= The IADH is an organisation that was developed by individuals in 1971 who have a passion for working within the community to endeavour to improve the overall health and wellbeing of a person with special needs, specifically through enhanced oral health care networks. The association was formerly known as the International Association of Dentistry for the Handicapped, but was altered to its current name to mirror present community ideology. Every 2 years since the association was established, the IADH runs an international congress in various locations worldwide and has members in over 40 countries. =Special Care Dentistry Association (SCDA)= SCDA was formed through an amalgamation of professionals from the Council of Hospital Dentistry, the Council of Dentistry for People with Disabilities and the Council of Geriatric Dentistry. These originally separate councils made the decision to collaborate due to their analogous objectives and devotion to advocating oral health for those with special needs. The SCDA is an international association that allows its members the opportunities to expand their knowledge and skills in the area of special needs through educational services, access to resources and networking opportunities. The SCDA promotes for legislations, develops practice guidelines and protocols to enhance oral health professionals‚Äô abilities to deliver quality healthcare to those who need it most.  Academic Journals Special Care in Dentistry= Special Care in Dentistry Association has an official journal titled Special Care in Dentistry. It is an online only publication that provides a comprehensive resource for dental professionals who are interested in learning more via education and interacting with other oral health care professionals. Access to oral healthcare is a key area this publication aims to enhance for patients with special needs. =The Journal of Disability and Oral Health= Published by the British Society for Disability and Oral Health, The Journal of Disability and Oral Health was founded by the International Association of Disability and Oral Health. The journal's mission is to publish innovative pieces relating to the holistic approach of oral care for a person with special needs. This quarterly journal is an effective modality for the distribution of information for all oral health and other allied health professionals who are concerned with the management and advocacy of oral health for the patient with special needs. Scope of Practice Dentists = Special Needs Dentists are practitioners that are concerned with the oral health of people severely affected by intellectual or physical disability, experience profound psychiatric or complex medical issues. They provide treatment which includes assessment, diagnosis, treatment, management and preventative services for people of all ages. The post-graduate training of three years exposes them to scenarios in which there are certain obstacles that must be over come to provide the treatment necessary. A special needs dentists may find it typical to perform procedures under general anaesthetic to ensure that the treatment is adequate and optimal. Although the procedures will not change in steps to achieve final product, it may be more advantageous and safe to complete treatment depending on the individuals needs. = Oral Health Therapist = Oral health therapists (OHT) are dual qualified as a dental therapist and dental hygienist. They provide oral health assessment, diagnosis, treatment, management and preventive services for children and adolescents and, if educated and trained in a program of study approved by the National Board, for adults of all ages. Their scope may include restorative treatment, tooth removal, oral health promotion, periodontal treatment, and other oral care to promote healthy oral behaviours. Oral health therapists may only work within a structured professional relationship with a dentist or dental specialist. The education requirement for a graduate oral health therapist to be registered is a minimum three year full-time bachelor's degree education program approved by the National Board. An oral health therapist may aid in performing daily self-maintenance activities for patients who have substantial physical or cognitive limitations, which may hinder their success in major life activities. They have a strong preventive focus and are strongly committed to fostering positive attitudes to oral health. Oral health therapy degrees have incorporated studies to allow their scope of practice to cover working with people with special needs. They may accompany a dentist within clinic or domiciliary environments to aid in education, disease control and maintenance of patients with special needs. The role of an oral health therapist within any dental practice is multifactorial and involves the fundamentals of oral hygiene instruction, simple restorations, and hygiene treatment. When working with special needs patients the oral health therapists is able to work independently, however when working along a dentist they are able to complete more holistic treatment for the patient.  Training Required to Become a Special Needs Dentist  Special needs dentistry is a challenging, diverse and rewarding aspect of the dental career to be involved in. Before becoming a special needs dentist there is a range of criteria that has to be met first. Firstly, to become a Special Needs Dentist there needs to be adequate knowledge and skills developed in a bachelor degree to become a general dentist. This can be completed at multiple universities in Australia including: * La Trobe University Bendigo * The University of Melbourne * The University of Adelaide * Charles Sturt University * Griffith University * James Cook University * University of Newcastle * University of Queensland * University of Sydney * University of Western AustraliaNetwork AE. Australian Education Network. Australian dental schools in Australia; 1998 [cited 2016 May 15]. Available from: http://www.australianuniversities.com.au/schools/dental/ or in New Zealand at the University of Otago. At all of the above universities there will be training in restorative, endodontics, periodontics, orthodontics and paediatrics. There is a general grasp given about Special Needs Dentistry but this may not suffice for some clinicians. The need thrive and want to become a specialist dentist within any field is highly appreciated, especially working within a team with patients with specials needs. The pathway to becoming a special needs dentist is as follows: Sustaining primary dental qualifications such as; BDS, BDSc or BDent at a dental school. Application is then made to the above dental schools for enrolment in their post graduate courses. During obtaining a fellowship in the Special Needs Dentistry field there are a range of case study reports that have to be completed and formulated. One in each of the following categories must be completed to detail the management of patients with: * Intellectual disability * Physical Disability * A patient representing the broad scope of Special Needs Dentistry * A multidisciplinary approach to treatment; and reflecting the interface between Special Needs Dentistry and at least one of the other specialties of dentistry or medicine. Rahtz W. HANDBOOK EDUCATION & EXAMINATION FOR MEMBERSHIP & FELLOWSHIP IN SPECIALIST DENTAL PRACTICE.; 2015.  The Oral Health Issues of People with Special Needs  Special care dentistry can be defined as a service that provides care for patients with physical, developmental, mental, sensory, behavioural, cognitive or emotional impairment which may be congenital, developmental, or acquired through disease, trauma, or environmental cause. Their conditions may hinder their daily activities and may have a major impact on their oral and general health. Examples of patients seen in special care dentistry are those suffering from severe cardiac and respiratory disease, learning disabilities, mental health conditions and neurological conditions. These individuals require special oral health care plans which are tailored to suit their needs and manage oral disease. =Cardiovascular Disease= CVD is the most common cause of death in the developed world. It is important that the dental team have a thorough understanding of common cardiac conditions and they know how to best manage these patients in the dental setting, since many dental procedures and drugs used in dentistry may aggravate heart disease. Common cardiovascular conditions that are dealt with in special care dentistry include: hypertension, angina, myocardial infarction and inherited and acquired bleeding disorders. Cardiovascular disease is associated with the following oral implications: * Periodontitis * Caries * Xerostomia It is imperative that preventative advice is implicated early on in the treatment of these patients in order to avoid the need for extensive dental care later on. =Respiratory Disease= The two most common respiratory diseases that may be encountered in dental practice are asthma and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). Asthma affects almost 5.2 million people in the UK today and causes an airway obstruction resulting in coughing, wheezing and/or shortness of breath. There is no cure for asthma however the management includes use of preventer and reliever inhalers. COPD is a chronic condition that encompasses a collection of lung diseases. COPD can vary in severity ranging from mild to severe disease with some patients suffering from respiratory failure. The development of COPD is predominantly due to smoking and is irreversible. =Developmental Disabilities= Patients suffering from developmental disabilities such as autism, cerebral palsy, down syndrome and intellectual disability have a multitude of different oral health issues. They and their carers require regular oral care to maintain a healthy dentition. * Autism: ** People with autism have a higher risk of caries, bruxism, tongue thrusting and self-injurious behaviour such as picking at the gingiva or biting the lips. In addition, delayed tooth eruption can be seen in Autistic patients. * Cerebral Palsy: ** Patients suffering from cerebral palsy not only struggle accessing dental services, their daily living is affected and therefore they often require additional support with activities including oral care. As a result, these patients are often faced with higher levels of untreated disease and tooth loss. *** Poor oral hygiene *** Periodontitis *** Xerostomia resulting from mouth breathing and medications *** Enamel hypoplasia *** Caries *** Drooling *** Dysphagia *** Bruxism *** Fractured teeth * Down's Syndrome: ** Down's syndrome is a genetic condition that results in learning disability and a variety of physical and medical features. The majority of these patients should be able to be seen in primary dental care with appropriate behavioural management techniques. the degree to which this is successful is entirely dependent on the extent of the learning disability and the cooperation of the patient. Many procedures can be successfully carried out under local anaesthesia but attention should be paid to any pre-existing cardiovascular or neurological conditions. Should the patient be uncooperative or require sedation or general anaesthesia, care can be shared with specialist services. The following oral features are common: *** Delayed dental development and eruption *** Hypodontia *** Microdontia *** Hypocalcification *** High incidence of severe early onset of periodontal disease *** Protruded tongue *** Strong gag reflex =Mental Health Conditions= This area of special care dentistry is more common in young adults and adolescents and examples of conditions that are dealt with regularly in the special care setting include schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. * Schizophrenia ** Signs and symptoms of schizophrenia include hallucinations, delusions, social withdrawal and apathy. The management of schizophrenia is usually through drug therapies and psychosocial interventions and many patients are well controlled and present no issues with routine dental care. However some aspects of schizophrenia and the management can impact on oral health: *** Poor self care including diet and oral hygiene *** Xerostomia as a result of antipsychotic medication *** Caries *** Periodontal disease *** Tardive dyskinesias characterised by involuntary muscle movements * Bipolar Disorder ** This disorder is thought to affect 1-3% of the population and is characterised by manic episodes and depressive episodes. since this condition is relatively common, it is important that dentists understand the main features of the condition and know when to refer for specialist care in a secondary care setting. Bipolar disorder can have an effect on oral health through: *** Poor oral hygiene *** Increased levels of plaque and calculus *** Increased risk of periodontal disease *** Increased caries *** Xerostomia * Depression ** 4-10% of people in England will be affected by depression. Typically managed in the primary dental care setting, there are still adverse dental effects that we should be aware of: *** Xerostomia (typically due to tricyclic antidepressant medication or due to an anxiety component to the disorder) *** Poor self care including diet and oral hygiene *** Caries (change in appetite/diet can be a factor in the disorder) *** Periodontal disease *** Oral dysaesthesia (generalised physical aches and pains) =Geriatric Patients= Geriatric patients or ‚Äòelderly‚Äô are also an aspect of special needs dentistry, as sometimes they may be needed with a little extra care and support whilst in the dental environment. Often with ageing there comes the slow shut down of the human body and organs, this can lead to multiple medication conditions and some in particular that are seen more readily in the geriatric population such as: * Cardiovascular disease * Diabetes * Hypertension * Macular degeneration Because of these particular medical conditions there are many treatment planning objectives that need to be taken into consideration such as ‚Äòis antibiotic prophylaxis required‚Äô, ‚Äò is this within my scope of practice to treat and manage‚Äô. Such considerations to the dental environment for geriatric patients include the use of handrails and wheelchair access throughout and outside of the practice. Also when treating the geriatric age group it may not just be situated within the dental practice is can include; independent living, shared housing, assisted living, continuous care communities and nursing homes. The Oral Health Therapist and Dentist are readily needed in these areas to help treat and prevent the further progression of dental disease. Extra empathy must be used when treating geriatric patients as some of them that are being treated may be palliative care or suffering from a severe and enduring mental illness. One of the major obstacles when treating this group of patients is gaining informed consent. Many health care workers in the field consider that the geriatric group can make and assist in their own decision making. Ensuring that the patient is fully adequate in making the informed decision about treatment planning is vital for legality reasonings.12\\\\. Friedman P. Geriatric dentistry. The socially excluded patients such as institutionalised elderly people and substance or drug abused people are also considered as special need patients. These individuals suffer from various oral health conditions. The institutionalised elderly people show more number of caries and root caries than other elderly groups. In addition, the drug abused people consume large quantity of sugar (especially methadone users) which lead to caries. Their teeth are mostly damaged or lost because of convulsions. They also show high level of anxiety towards dental services. The mentally challenged patients have various specific oral health issues. These are missing or discoloured teeth, periodontal disease and oral malodour. Furthermore, they suffer from xerostomia (dry mouth) because of their medications. This situation increases their risk of dental caries. These patients often require support to maintain their overall health.  Clinical Management of the Special Needs patient within the Dental Clinic  It is common that patients with mild or moderate forms of intellectual or physical disabled can be treated within the dental environment successfully. Making the patient comfortable, and ensuring they have a familiar setting each appointment can contribute to successful treatment.Trobe, L. (2016d). La Trobe university LMS: Log in to the site.

The patient should be supported emotionally, and most importantly physically with the use of protective measures to ensure their safety. Protective measures can include pillows to support and stabilise their head, neck and/or back, making sure the pathway for the patient is clear, with no chairs, cables or foot pedals in the way, and identifying hazardous objects are away from the patient such as sharp instruments on the bracket tray. Communication is the key element of building a strong rapport with your patient. For those with difficulties or communication impairments, it is imperative that the operator remains patient, actively listens, and allows the patient to finish their sentences. If communication is difficult to understand, consulting with their caregiver may be appropriate. The operator should adapt their communication if the patient has auditory, visual or speech impairments. For auditory impairments, ensure background noise is kept to a minimum, use clear speech, you may be required to speak at a louder volume, but never assume this until it is required. It may also be helpful to avoid wearing a face-mask for communication, or instead consider wearing a clear face shield. For visually impaired patients, always face them when discussing things, ensure tactile senses are utilised, such as a warm hand-shake upon arrival. The patients with speech impediments should be spoken to as you would speak to any patient, it is often mistaken that because the patient has a speech impairment, they have may be developmentally delayed or may have cognitive impairments too, but this is not always the case. Depending on the patients‚Äô condition/s, certain measures may need to be taken in order to safely and successfully treat the patient in a general dental setting. If cooperation is not gained, or the patients special needs exceed what may be provided within a general dental practice, if extensive dental treatment is required, or the patients physical or systemic health are a hazard during treatment, dental treatment under general anaesthetic or within a hospitalised setting may be appropriate instead. To prevent any undesired results from invasive dental treatment, it may be suggested to contact the patients General Practitioner or Specialists. This is particularly important if the patient has cardiac conditions and may require Antibiotic Prophylaxis prior to dental treatment. Some special needs patients require specific measures throughout dental treatment, for example: =Autistic patients= Trobe, L. (2016). La Trobe university LMS: Log in to the site.

This may even involve having the same staff present, and the same surgery set out as per previous appointments. * Prior to treatment, identify through medical history how severe the condition is, and whether there are certain triggers for undesirable behaviours or actions; and avoid these where possible. * Communication is important in managing Autistic patients. Use the ‚Äòtell-show-do‚Äô method. Explain each dental procedure before you start and take them through step by step. Offer them a mirror to observe what you are doing, provided it is a non- invasive procedure, and motivate the patient to ask questions. * Plan a desensitising appointment prior to any formal treatment, show them all aspects of the dental office, let them look at the equipment and instruments likely to be used with the patient in future (for example, mirror, triplex, and suction). This can also extend into a limited examination for the first appointment if the patient permits it. Begin an extra-oral examination using your hands first, and if the patient cooperates, try using a toothbrush to gain access into their mouth. The familiarity of the toothbrush will allow them to feel comfortable, but also allows the operator to further examine the mouth. * Always make the appointments short and positive with rewards and reinforcements when/where necessary * Keep the light out of the patients eyes, and ensure any instruments are out of their sight, try to be cautious of noises within the dental surgery. Calming background music can be a positive addition to the surgery, particularly if it is something the patient will recognise. * Immobilisation techniques are only to be used when absolutely necessary to protect the patient and staff during dental treatment. =Cerebral Palsy= Trobe, L.

If the patient is moved to the dental chair, ensure the patient has time to get into a position that is safe, and comfortable for them. * Always ensure their head and neck are securely stabilised with pillows. This is to avoid uncontrolled movements and primitive movements, which commonly occur with movements of the head and neck, or if the patient is startled. This causes the limbs to extend and/or flex, a potential danger with dental treatment to the patient, operator and staff. * If the patient requires dental treatment in their wheelchair, consider using a backboard or head/neck pillows for support. * Observe patterns in the patients uncontrolled movements, trying to blend your own movements around them. * Be gentle and slow when moving the patients head, and exert gentle but firm pressure on patients‚Äô arm/leg if it begins to shake. =Down Syndrome= Trobe, L.

Dental Problems and their management in patients with dementia. BDA December 2013 Dementia is a progressive disease where each stage requires different clinical management. One of the main areas of difficulty with this disease is the progressive loss of capacity for the patient to consent for treatment. For this reason, it is important to plan for the patient's future wishes and to restore dental health for a dentition that will be easily maintained as symptoms progress. Early stage * Complete any major restorative treatment as soon as possible while the patient has capacity to consent * Plan long-term care to restore function; gain consent at this stage for future treatment * Include friends, family and carers in the provision of care; ensure care will be provided throughout progression of disease * Prevention is key Moderate stage * Minimally invasive treatment * Easily maintained treatment * Complete treatment in short stages/shorter appointments * Least traumatic intervention where possible * Prevention is key Late stage * Relieve pain * Provide antibiotics if systemic involvement * Minimally invasive treatment * Prevention is key  Access to Dental Care  The Australian and New Zealand Academy of Special Needs Dentistry found that people with disabilities are rarely identified as a priority population group in the public health policy and practice. It is recognised that people with special needs rely on their carers for their dental visits and daily care. Moreover, one study found that carers are confronted with different problems such as, dentists who lack skills in managing people with disabilities. Other complications include inconvenient locations of dental clinics, transport issues and cost of dental treatment. The Australian Dental Association (ADA) recognised that there are only a few dental practitioners that work to improve the oral health of people with special needs. Not only is their access to care almost non-existent in comparison to the general population, but also the facilities are inadequate and staff lack awareness of oral health matters that may impact those with special needs. Facilities such as general anaesthesia which some patients require for dental treatment, is found to be very limited in the public sector. It can be concluded that access to dental care for this population is not only a barrier physically, but also they are disadvantaged by the lack of equipment and facilities available to achieve dental care.1\\\\. D N, Federal H. Submission 552 - Australian dental association Inc - disability care and support - public inquiry. [place unknown: publisher unknown]; 2010. This population group experience higher levels of oral health disease and poorer access to oral health care. For some, dental access could be influenced by socio-economic disadvantage making it difficult to have treatment. As a result, people with special needs are primarily receiving emergency dental care rather than general dental.Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2009, Oral health of health cardholders attending for dental care in the private and public sectors, Dental Statistics and Research Series, Number 50. Other possible factors that could contribute to poor access include:D N, Federal H. Submission 552 - Australian dental association Inc - disability care and support - public inquiry. [place unknown: publisher unknown]; 2010.* Poor information regarding available dental surgery * Access to appropriate oral health information * Potential negative attitudes to the need to oral healthcare by either the individual or the carers * Anxiety and fear * Cost in emotional, financial, psychological and social terms * Physical access issues, transport or the dental surgery In saying this, Dental Health Services Victoria (DHSV) has recognised some barriers that prevent dental access for people with special needs. To allow easy access to The Royal Dental Hospital of Melbourne, DHSV has incorporated different strategies. Some include three lifts to all floors of the hospital and incorporating four disabled parking spaces and a wheel chair ramp. For the population who is housebound due to physical disabilities, DHSV has provided a domiciliary oral health service to reduce the challenges that could occur if patients were to travel to the hospital. The dental care provided by this service includes emergency and general dental care such as dental assessments, oral health advice, prevention and extractions. The service is also free if patients have a pensioner Concession care, health care card or a Veteran Affairs Gold card. Victoria DHS.[place unknown: publisher unknown].

He was the most successful German pilot at the extremely hazardous practice of shooting down enemy observation balloons; 20 of his triumphs were against them. R√∂th concentrated on observation balloons because they were large enough targets for him to see and hit with machine gun fire. Early life Friedrich R√∂th was born in Nurnburg, Germany on 29 September 1893. He was the son of a factory owner. He became known by the nickname of \\"Fritz\\". He was just graduating college when World War I broke out.Above the Lines: The Aces and Fighter Units of the German Air Service, Naval Air Service and Flanders Marine Corps, 1914‚Äì1918, pp. 192-193 Early service Friedrich R√∂th served originally in an artillery regiment. He was seriously wounded early in the war, spending many months in hospital. Once he was again fit for duty, he was commissioned on 29 May 1915. He transferred to the aerial service, only to be severely injured in a crash and spend nearly another year in hospital. Because of his extended recuperation, he did not win his wings until early 1917. His initial assignment was to a Bavarian artillery spotting unit, Flieger- Abteilung (Artillerie) 296.Fokker D.VII Aces of World War I Part 2, p. 10 While with them, he was granted the Bavarian Military Merit Order with Swords on 11 June. Beginning 17 September 1917, he served in Jagdstaffel 34, but did not down any enemies until he was assigned to Jagdstaffel 23 on 4 October. On 1 November, he was awarded the Iron Cross, First Class. Balloon busting ace R√∂th did not enjoy any success as a fighter pilot until he decided to concentrate his effort on observation balloons. He was a poor shot, and took up firing upon balloons because they were a large target.Balloon Busting Aces of World War I, p. 67 His decision meant he took upon himself one of the most hazardous duties of World War I fighter aviation. Because balloons flew at a known altitude, antiaircraft guns ringing them were extremely accurate. The balloons were low enough that an attacker was exposed to small arms fire as well. Protective fighters also lurked in the vicinity. The balloons were so well defended because they were an important part of the artillery fire direction systems of World War I.Balloon Busting Aces of World War I, pp. 7-9 On 25 January 1918, as a member of Jagdstaffel 23, R√∂th scored his first victories, downing three balloons in eight minutes. He shot down a British observation plane on 26 February and downed another pair of balloons on 21 March. On 1 April, he singlehandedly shot down four balloons in ten minutes. Command R√∂th was assigned to command Jagdstaffel 16 on 8 April 1918, just four days after the previous Staffelf√ºhrer, Heinrich Geigl, died in a midair collision with a Sopwith Camel.Pfalz Scout Aces of World War I, p. 48 During this assignment, he established a reputation as a modest idealist, pious and courageous. By this time, he had begun scrupulous planning of his raids on balloons, spending hours studying potential target balloons through a telescope. He also loaded his guns to maximize effectiveness against balloons; his left-hand machine gun would be loaded with 80 percent incendiaries and 20 percent armor-piercing, and the right-hand gun vice versa. As his new unit used Pfalz D.IIIa fighters, R√∂th may have used one occasionally.Balloon Busting Aces of World War I, pp. 68-69 R√∂th's Albatros DVa was not quite this colorful. At this time, R√∂th was known to fly an Albatros D.V marked with his personal livery overlaying the standard markings. It bore a white propeller spinner, yellow fuselage, and gray engine cowling, and wheel covers. Painted on the fuselage's side even with the trailing edge of the cockpit was a large disk divided into white and black halves.Albatros Aces of World War I, pp. 72, 95 On 29 May 1918, R√∂th attacked the balloons he had been spying upon. Picking a time when there were no enemy fighter in sight, and the wind in his favor, R√∂th flamed five balloons in 15 minutes without assistance. Five other balloons were rapidly winched to ground to protect them. R√∂th had expended 220 rounds to burn the balloons. Dodging enemy fighters, braving a storm of antiaircraft fire, he made a single deadly firing pass at each balloon. Cowell was flying a Bristol F2B when downed by R√∂th. R√∂th received a new Fokker D.VII fighter in early August; he would use this type airplane for his last 10 aerial victories.Balloon Busting Aces of World War I, pp. 72, 95 He would go on to bag three balloons each on 13 August and 10 October, along with seven enemy airplanes on various dates. His most notable victory was over 16-victory Irish ace Sgt. John Cowell, whose 20 Squadron Bristol F.2b he shot down on 30 July 1918. R√∂th was also honored with Germany's highest decoration for valor, the Pour le M√©rite, on 8 September 1918. R√∂th's last victory was on 14 October 1918; he was wounded in the foot during the fight. The cast on R√∂th's foot kept him out of combat for the short remainder of the war. On 11 November 1918, he was being piloted against orders over the battlefield as the guns fell silent.Fokker D.VII Aces of World War I, p. 11 R√∂th's final victory list credited him with destroying 20 enemy observation balloons and eight enemy airplanes. Post-war death On 31 December 1918, R√∂th shot himself to death. He was reportedly depressed by Germany's defeat and the subsequent ongoing revolution, as well as troubled by his killings during the war. He was buried in Saint Johannis Friedhof in Nuremberg. His family refused to mark his grave because his suicide was considered a sin. In 1919, R√∂th was posthumously awarded the Military Order of Max Joseph. This award knighted him, thus posthumously changing his name to Friedrich Ritter von R√∂th. The award also entitled him to a lifelong pension.Balloon Busting Aces of World War I, p. 70 Inline citationsReferences * Above the Lines: The Aces and Fighter Units of the German Air Service, Naval Air Service and Flanders Marine Corps, 1914‚Äì1918.

Early life Adeishvili was born in the village of Mtisdziri in Qvareli district, then-Soviet Georgia. He graduated from the Faculty of Law, Tbilisi State University in 1994 and continued his training as a jurist at the Institute of State and Law in Tbilisi, Georgia and the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. He served as the leading specialist on constitutional law for the Parliament of Georgia from 1996 and 1999. He then worked in the NGO sector (such as the Georgian Young Lawyers' Association and the Liberty Institute) and briefly practiced law until becoming a Member of Parliament on President Eduard Shevardnadze-led Union of Citizens of Georgia (UCG) party ticket in November 1999. Political career Adeishvili was a member of an influential and vocal minority group of the UCG faction, dubbed as \\"reformers\\", which was led by Zurab Zhvania and Mikheil Saakashvili and called for more radical and Western-oriented political reforms.Wheatley, Jonathan (2005), Georgia from National Awakening to Rose Revolution, pp. 117, 147. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., At the end of 2001, when the CUG was in the process of collapse, Adeishvili joined Saakashvili's New National Movement and became a member of its parliamentary affiliate, the Faction for Democratic Reforms, which were in opposition to Shevardnadze's government. After the bloodless \\"Rose Revolution\\" in November 2003 toppled down Shevardnadze and swept the \\"reformers\\" to power, Adeishvili served successively as Minister of Justice (December 2003 ‚Äì February 2004), Minister for State Security (February‚ÄìJune 2004), Prosecutor General (June 2004 ‚Äì January 2008), and Head of Administration of President of Georgia (January‚ÄìNovember 2008). As an influential member in the government and a close ally of President Saakashvili, Adeishvili has become a subject of criticism from Georgian opposition, especially during his tenure as Prosecutor General. In the October 2008 cabinet reshuffle, Adeishvili was again put in charge of Ministry of Justice which had recently been merged with the Prosecutor General's Office. In his new capacity, Adeishvili said liberalization of the criminal code would be one of his priorities.Justice Minister-Designate Says ‚ÄòLiberal Approach‚Äô Needed.

Adeishvili's term at the Ministry of Justice is associated with significant decrease of corruption and improved efficiency of civil and property registration services, which were further transformed into a new concept of Public Service Hall.Public Service Hall Soon after elections, the new Government began to implement its campaign promise to ‚Äúrestore justice‚Äù by launching criminal prosecutions against officials of Saakashvili Government. Those prosecutions were largely met critically by international community due to a concern for what appeared to be a selective justice, political retribution and intimidation of opposition.http://thehill.com/images/stories/blogs/globalaffairs/georgialetter.pdfhttp://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref- ViewPDF.asp?FileID=20062‚ü®=en After his meeting with the new Prime Minister Ivanishvili on November 12, 2013, President of European Commission Jos√© Manuel Barroso noted, that ‚Äúsituations of selective justice should be avoided as they could harm the country‚Äôs image abroad and weaken the rule of law.‚Äù In April 2015, General Secretariat of INTERPOL revoked its red notice against Zurab Adeishvili.

Plot  Nallasivam is a rich farmer and lives in the village Pillaiyarpatti with his son Rajangam and daughter Karpagam. Rajangam is married to Pankajam, daughter of the greedy Thandavam; Karpagam is married to Sundaram, a hardworking farmer from the same village. Karpagam and Sundaram continue to live with Nallasivam at his request to take care of the households and the farm. Pankajam gives birth to a girl named Meenakshi, but she and Rajangam neglect her. Karpagam, who is childless, takes care of Meenakshi who starts considering Karpagam and Sundaram as her parents. Unhappy to see how Rajangam is squandering money, Nallasivam hands over the administration of his properties to Sundaram. Pankajam, who has ignored her child in her formative years, is annoyed with this development and at the instigation of Thandavam, forces Rajangam to send a legal notice to his father, asking for property settlement. Thandavam creates problems in Rajangam's family by brainwashing and misleading Pankajam and Rajangam, who blindly follow his advice. When Meenakshi is taken away by Rajangam, Karpagam goes into depression. Finally, Rajangam sends her back and Karpagam becomes happy. A bull attacks Meenakshi, and Karpagam is killed saving her. Meenakshi refuses to return to her parents and opts to stay with Nallasivam and Sundaram. Nallasivam forcibly gets his son-in-law married to his friend's daughter Amudha, who was a friend of Karpagam, so that the child will have a mother. Sundaram and Meenakshi do not accept Amudha. Sundaram lives in the memory of his deceased wife Karpagam, roaming around like a sage. Amudha longs for the love and attention of both Sundaram and Meenakshi. Sadness prevails at home. Meanwhile, Rajangam and Thandavam conspire to swindle Nallasivam. Thandavam, frustrated with his failure to swindle the wealth of Nallasivam's family, decides to kill Sundaram and sends goons to attack him. Both Nallasivam and Amudha come and save him, while Thandavam is arrested. In the process, Amudha gets stabbed when a goon tries to attack Sundaram. When she is almost dying, Meenakshi sings her favourite song \\"Athai Madi Methaiyadi\\" and Amudha is saved. Sundaram realises Amudha's love for Meenakshi.

Release and reception  Karpagam was released on 15 November 1963, Diwali day. Ananda Vikatan, in its review dated 8 December 1963, positively the film, describing Ranga Rao's performance as the highlight of the film. The reviewer also appreciated Vijaya's performance and lauded that of Shakila. According to the reviewer, the film's only weakness was the fact that it was stretched like rubber in the second half. The film was also a commercial success, running for over 100 days in theatres. Karpagam won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil ‚Äì Certificate of Merit for the Second Best Feature Film, and the Rashtrapati Award for S. V. Ranga Rao.Sanmana Satkaralu, Viswa Nata Chakravarti, M. Sanjay Kishore, Sangam Akademy, Hyderabad, 2005, pp: 65. It was later remade in Hindi as Rishte Naate (1965), in Telugu as Thodu Needa (1965), and in Malayalam as Vishukkani (1977). The film is also available for viewing on Prime Video.  Legacy  From the profits the film made, Gopalakrishnan built Karpagam Studio. Though Vijaya feared she would not get further acting offers due to her character's early death in Karpagam which she considered a \\"bad omen\\", she went on to act in more than 500 films.

Active in the movement are artists in the United States, Denmark, the Czech Republic, and Canada.  Philosophy  The core philosophy of Neosymbolism, like that of its predecessor Symbolism, is the idea of \\"correspondences\\", the \\"emblematic order\\" of a world in which technology and the industrial reality have not yet drowned the forces of mysticism and belief. In a world where visual images exist to generate sales and revenue, Neosymbolist imagery attempts to preserve the relationship between image and the human soul. The imagery is necessarily representational rather than abstract. It borders on the narrative, but stops short of the commercial trap of illustration to convey an idea for profit. Artists like Norman Rockwell could qualify as Neosymbolist painters in that they adopt a social and cultural undercurrent and then convey it in terms of the cultural cliche‚Äîthe image as representative of core aspects of the culture. The same is not true, however, of the generally accepted idea of commercial illustration which attempts more to influence cultural, political, and economic ideology than it tries to communicate an existential reality. Neosymbolism is fairly well-hidden within the culture, with few references and almost no broad-based visibility. In 1988, Nick A_Demos published a book in two editions. This was the first visible sign of an idea underlying a Neosymbolist philosophy. A_Demos then developed this first book of Neosymbolism into paintings. He was also the first to use the word \\"Neosymbolism\\", thus coining it. There has also been a separate group using the Neosymbolism name for the creation of an international collective representing a number of artists who share the goals of preserving the visual art of Symbolism (the foundation of the ideas associated with the term Neosymbolism) in its original and essential sense. This preservation, as opposed to the \\"non-sense\\" of various philosophies that have evolved since the late nineteenth century and have deviated from the core Symbolist philosophy. The Neosymbolist movement was born spontaneously in numerous locations across the globe. Many groups use the word but also do not want to be limited to only this discipline. A group of Danish Neosymbolists defined their movement thus: * Using Iconic language in their expressions * Reproducing the inner experience of the outer world * Examining the human experience and circumstance in today‚Äôs changing world * Examining the underlying meaning of life * Using media in conscious and innovative ways The founder of the Canadian Neosymbolists, meanwhile, describes the foundations of their movement in Brief Summary of the Foundations of Canadian Neosymbolism, written by their founder, Gary F. Manzo. * Using Symbolic language in our expressions, often derived from Dream Sequences and Archetypal Imagery as described by Carl Jung, and others involved with Mysticism, Alchemy, Depth Psychology and Philosophy. * Depicting the inner experience of the outer world, in relationship to Self- Actualization and Depth Psychology and related fields of study. * Examining the human experience and circumstance in today‚Äôs changing world, with the idea that mankind must ‚Äúmake friends with his animal nature‚Äù in order to achieve Wholeness of SELF in a contemporary world. * Examining the underlying meaning of life, both from an historical perspective and its relevancy to the new age of Technology as well as New Age Psychology. * Using mediums and techniques, in conscious, experimental and innovative ways, utilizing both traditional methods and contemporary cutting-edge techniques and technologies. Another international Neosymbolist collective that began exhibiting as a group in 2001 has a simpler definition: \\\\- The \\"exploration of the emotional, political, and spiritual themes of the rapidly changing culture of the late 20th and early 21st (century) through the use of symbols both personal and universal.\\" This perspective of the Neosymbolist movement can be seen as a reaction against abstraction, an attempt to weave artists‚Äô intellectual and spiritual experiences into the fabric of their work. Furthermore, the Neosymbolists‚Äô palette is not limited to the use of words and ancient symbols of ideas, even as these remain powerful tools of expression.

This particular 'ndrina is based in Locri, a hotbed of 'Ndrangheta activity. The clan allied, with the Marafioti family, is involved in a long blood feud with the Cord√¨ 'ndrina, from the same town, since the end of the 1960s. Feud with Cord√¨ clan The feud started when historical boss of the clan, Domenico Cord√¨, was killed in Locri on June 23, 1967, in the so-called Piazza Mercato massacre. Gratteri & Nicaso, Fratelli di Sangue, pp. 130-31. Two years after the killing, the Cord√¨ clan hit back, killing Giuseppe and Domenico Marafioti, respectively the brother and son of Bruno Marafioti, boss of the clan and allied with the Cataldos. A series of hostilities continued until 1975 when the adversaries, weakened by losses on both sides, agreed to a truce. The truce fell apart, due a bomb attack on July 4, 1993, against the boss of the Cataldo clan, Giuseppe Cataldo. He was the target of a bomb which was thrown at the car driven by his wife. The car was completely destroyed, but Cataldo and his wife miraculously survived. Hostilities between the two clans resumed. Operazione Mistero / Faida di Locri, storia di inestricabili rancori , Gazzetta del Sud, March 19, 2010 In 2010, police investigations based on intercepted conversations and government witnesses revealed that the Cord√¨ and Cataldo clans signed a peace after a bitter feud that lasted for 40 years causing dozens of deaths. They formed a strong alliance aimed at a joint management of the crime business in the area, in particular in obtaining public work contracts and the extortion industry. 'Ndrangheta, arrestate nel Reggino tre persone legate alla cosca Cord√¨ , Il Quotidiano della Calabria, November 16, 2010 Important 'Ndrangheta clan In the 1970s, the Cataldos allied themselves with the De Stefano 'ndrina from Reggio Calabria in the First 'Ndrangheta war. Gratteri & Nicaso, Fratelli di Sangue, p.58 Giuseppe and Nicola Cataldo were part of the hit squad, which also included Vincenzo, Giuseppe and Francesco Mazzaferro, that killed the traditional 'Ndrangheta boss Antonio Macr√¨ and wounded Francesco Commisso, Macr√¨'s right hand man. Giuseppe Cataldo became a member of La Provincia, a provincial commission of the 'Ndrangheta, formed at the end of the Second 'Ndrangheta war in September 1991, to avoid further internal conflicts. Sentenza procedimento penale Olimpia , Tribunale di Reggio Calabria, January 19, 1999 The Cataldo clan was also involved in cocaine trafficking from Colombia with the Sicilian Cuntrera-Caruana Mafia clan. In March 1994 the Italian police seized 5497 kilogrammes of cocaine (a European record at the time) in Borgaro Torinese near Turin (the investigation was code-named Operation Cartagine). A joint venture of 'Ndrangheta clans in the trafficking included the Barbaro 'ndrina (Plat√¨), Ierin√≤ 'ndrina (Gioiosa Ionica), Morabito 'ndrina (Africo), Mazzaferro 'ndrina (Gioiosa Ionica) and Pesce 'ndrina (Rosarno).

The episode first aired in the United States and Canada on November 12, 2000, on Fox and subsequently aired in the United Kingdom on February 18, 2001. It was written by executive producer Chris Carter and directed by Kim Manners. The episode helps to explore the series' overarching mythology and continues from the seventh season finale, \\"Requiem\\", and season eight premiere, \\"Within\\", in which Fox Mulder was abducted by aliens who are planning to colonize Earth. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 9.0 in the United States and was seen by 15.1 million viewers. As with the previous episode, \\"Within,\\" it was generally well-received by critics, although some detractors criticized various plot points. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In the episode, John Doggett (Robert Patrick) continues his search for Mulder, and attempts to uncover an alien bounty hunter within their ranks. After the task force is called off, Scully is surprised to learn that Doggett, the leader of the team, has been assigned to the X-Files. \\"Without\\" featured scenes of Mulder imprisoned on an alien spaceship, and as so new sets were created for this unique locale. The production crew of The X-Files designed the set in a decidedly \\"low-tech\\" and \\"interesting\\" manner. In addition, unusual filming techniques were used, such as special lenses and motion control, in order to achieve the desired footage.  Plot Background= FBI special agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is currently missing, having been abducted by aliens in the seventh season finale, \\"Requiem.\\" His partner Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) has been working with Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick) in order to locate him. After consulting with The Lone Gunmen, a trio of conspiracy theorists made up of John Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard Langly (Dean Haglund), Scully finds evidence that Mulder may be in Arizona. Doggett receives news that Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka), a boy with potentially extraterrestrial DNA, may be in hiding in Arizona as well. The two, along with Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and a task force of FBI agents arrive and, after searching, find Mulder and Praise on the corner of a mountain. =Events= Doggett pursues \\"Mulder\\" and Praise and corners them at the edge of a cliff. Doggett convinces \\"Mulder\\" to release Praise who runs off alone, but \\"Mulder\\" intentionally steps off the precipice and apparently falls to his death. When agents go to retrieve the body, they only find footprints. Scully realizes \\"Mulder\\" was an Alien Bounty Hunter sent to retrieve Praise. While the Alien Bounty Hunter returns to the school to continue his search for Praise, Scully follows Praise's schoolmate, a deaf girl named Thea (Christine Firkins), through the desert to a hidden underground room. Praise has broken his leg reaching the hiding place. Scully applies first aid, but is unable to move him without a car. After Doggett explains the events on the cliff to Alvin Kersh, Skinner tells him that Kersh is setting him up to fail. Shortly afterwards, the Alien Bounty Hunter (now disguised as Scully) attacks Agent Landau. Skinner and the real Scully eventually manage to drive the alien away. Later, Skinner gets Praise to a hospital, but leaves Scully behind in the desert. Searching for Mulder in the desert, Scully sees a bright light in the sky which is revealed to be a helicopter with Doggett inside. Doggett insists Scully travel with him to the hospital; she reluctantly accepts. There, two other FBI agents assure them that nothing has happened to Praise; however, they soon discover that he has vanished. Scully leaves to search for Praise while Doggett stays in an attempt to catch the intruder. He checks the ceiling space, where he finds Skinner badly injured. Scully finds Praise with \\"Skinner\\" who claims to be protecting the boy. The Alien Bounty Hunter attempts to kill her, but Scully shoots and kills him first. After reporting to Kersh, Doggett is assigned to the X-Files with Scully. Meanwhile, Mulder continues to be held in captivity, experimented on and tortured as six Bounty Hunters look on.  Production  After David Duchovny fulfilled his contractual obligations with the show's seventh season, he felt that there was not much else to do with the character. Fox Mulder's abduction was thus devised by Chris Carter towards the end of seventh season as a way of allowing the actor to leave the series. Mulder's experimentation scenes. Several of the scenes from this episode take place on the alien spaceship in which Mulder is being imprisoned. When designing the interior look of the ship, production designer Cory Kaplan was attracted to primitive materials. In an interview, she noted, \\"We all see super-tech [in spaceships] now, but the idea of low-tech was much more interesting to me, much more visual. So, you take elements of rock and steel and chisel them into interesting shapes.\\" Her task was aided by the discovery of a backdrop from the film Alien (1979), which she and director of photography Bill Roe \\"lit ... very dimly and put it behind\\" the chair in which Mulder is restrained. According to Kaplan, the chair \\"was just this rotating platform with this humongous dental piece that could rotate around as well and pull [Mulder's] face apart.\\" According to Makeup Supervisor Cheri Montasanto-Medcalf, Matthew Mungle helped in the creation of the alien torture machine by making prosthetic cheeks, which were pierced by hooks. These cheeks were applied to Duchovny, whom Montasanto-Medcalf notes \\"sat pretty good through all that.\\" This episode made use of several unusual filming techniques. Visual Effects Supervisor John Wash recalls, \\"We devised a laser effect where a device is going into [Mulder's] mouth and some other weird lens effects that were going over the scene to give it an alien, other-world-like quality.\\" During one scene, an extremely small drill was to approach the camera. The producers were forced to find a way to film not only the tiny device, but also make the entire sequence suspenseful. Supervising producer Paul Rabwin noted, \\"I had to set up a very, very highly magnified lens to try to get this little device coming right at us. It was very, very scary. We ended up putting some really cool sound effects in there, little servos and motors.\\" The sequence at the end of the episode in which multiple Alien Bounty Hunters appear required the use of motion control, a method in which a motion-control camera on a computerized module is repeatedly run through the same motion while elements are continually added. According to John Wash, this was one of the few times that the series employed motion control, which made it slightly harder to film than most other scenes. To accomplish the effect, the cameras first filmed a pass over the empty set and lighting elements. Then, the production crew filmed five different passes, each one with the Alien Bounty Hunter in a different location. By compositing all the shots together, the production crew was able to \\"clone\\" the Bounty Hunter and have him surround Mulder.  Reception  \\"Without\\" premiered on American television on November 12, 2000, on Fox. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 9.0, meaning that it was seen by 9.0% of the nation's estimated households, and was viewed by 9.07 million households, and 15.1 million viewers. Fox promoted the episode with the tagline \\"Once in a great while a story takes a turn that you never expect... Tonight this is one of them.\\" The episode was later included on The X-Files Mythology, Volume 3 ‚Äì Colonization, a DVD collection that contains episodes involved with the alien Colonist's plans to take over the earth. The episode was met with relatively positive reviews from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five. The two praised the episode's plot, citing the abduction and search for Mulder as components to the arcs \\"brilliance\\". Shearman and Pearson noted that the final scene, featuring Mulder surrounded by the alien bounty hunter was created with \\"beauty, emotion, and horror which in collision make The X-Files one of the best shows on TV.\\"Shearman and Pearson, p. 230 Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club wrote that both \\"Without\\" and \\"Within\\" form \\"a great way to pick up after the cliffhanger ending of the previous season\\" and that \\"the pair of episodes [...] work well as an introduction to the new narrative status quo.\\" He awarded both entries a \\"B+\\" but noted, however, that \\"Without\\" nearly came across as \\"strained or stalling\\", but \\"manages to get by with the general freakiness of the alien bounty hunter\\". Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a rare \\"A+\\". The previous episode, \\"Within\\", also received an \\"A+\\" grade, making them the only two episodes of The X-Files to receive this rating from the site. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly was positive towards both this episode and the season premiere, \\"Within,\\" awarding the episodes an \\"A-\\". George Avalos and Michael Liedtke from the Contra Costa Times praised the episode and noted that the Scully/Dogget dynamic and the hunt for Fox Mulder worked towards the show's strengths. Tom Janulewicz from Space.com positively commented on Scully's conversion from skeptic to believer, writing, \\"Regardless of whether it's aliens, flukemen, or pizza delivering vampires, The X-Files is all about phenomena that don't stand in the face of 'rational' explanations. It took her a long time, but like Mulder before her, Scully eventually came to accept that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in her philosophy.\\" Not all reviews were positive. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a more mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris criticized both Scully becoming the believer as well as the \\"sky turning out to be a helicopter gimmick\\", which she notes \\"has gotten way too old.\\" Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations wrote a relatively negative review of the episode. He noted, \\"All ['Without'] did was remind me why the show is a hollow shell of what it once was as long as Fox Mulder is strapped to an alien table and why The Doggett and Pony Show holds absolutely no appeal to me whatsoever.\\"Kessenich, p. 153  Notes FootnotesBibliography   External links  * * \\"Without\\" at TV.com Category:2000 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about alien abduction Category:Television episodes set in Arizona Category:The X-Files (season 8) episodes Category:Television episodes set in Washington, D.C.

Hon. Edward Lyttelton (23 July 1855 ‚Äì 26 January 1942) was an English sportsman, schoolmaster and cleric from the Lyttelton family. He played first- class cricket for Cambridge University and Middlesex as well as representing the England national football team. Life Lyttelton was educated at Eton College followed by Trinity College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he was a member and club librarian of the University Pitt Club. He came from a sporting family, with five brothers playing first-class cricket, Alfred, Charles, George, Arthur (\\"Right\\") and Robert. His father, George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton, was a British aristocrat and Tory politician. His brother-in-law, Cyril Alington, was a scholar who later wrote a book called Edward Lyttelton: An Appreciation. From 1880 to 1882, Lyttelton worked as an assistant master at Wellington College, and then at Eton College during which time he was ordained in 1886 following residence at Cuddesdon College. He was appointed Headmaster of Haileybury College in 1890, where he remained until 1905. Lyttelton was a canon of St Albans Cathedral from 1895 to 1905. Between 1905 and 1916 he was the Head Master of Eton College.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography While at Eton Lyttelton continued the reforms introduced into the curriculum by his predecessor Edmond Warre which resulted in boys being able to enter the school having done no Greek, and being able to specialize in mathematics, modern languages, science, or history. His Christian principles made his position difficult after the outbreak of the First World War, especially after he preached a sermon at St Margaret's, Westminster, in March 1915, in which he said that the whole German nation should not be condemned and that any peace settlement should be generous. This led to a public storm of protest, and perhaps partly as a result Lyttelton resigned in 1916. He gave up school mastering and worked through his spiritual problems as a parish priest, becoming in 1917 a curate to the Revd. Richard \\"Dick\\" Sheppard at St Martin- in-the-Fields and then from 1918 to 1920 working as rector of the small parish of Sidestrand in Norfolk. He became dean of Whitelands College, Chelsea, a teacher training college for women, in 1920, acting as chaplain and lecturer on the Bible. He retired in 1929 after a serious operation, to Norwich where he was an honorary canon 1931‚Äì1941. =Sporting career= Edward (right) and his younger brother Alfred at Eton, circa 1872 A right-handed middle order batsman, Lyttelton had his best season in 1878 when he amassed 779 runs at 29.96, helping Middlesex to finish as joint Champions. He scored his only first-class hundred that year, an innings of 113 which he made while playing for Middlesex against the touring Australian side, at Lord's. His century stood out as it occurred in the fourth innings, was double the next highest score in the match by either team (56) and was made despite Middlesex being bowled out for just 185. According to Wisden, Lyttelton's last 76 runs came in only 74 minutes. In the same season, Lyttelton took the only wicket of his first-class career, Yorkshire opening batsman George Ulyett, who also batted for England. He dismissed him, caught and bowled, in a match for Cambridge University against Yorkshire. Aside from Cambridge University and Middlesex he also represented the Gentlemen cricket team, I Zingari, Marylebone Cricket Club and the South of England cricket team. Lyttelton's only full football international came in a 7‚Äì2 defeat by Scotland on 2 March 1878. Another significant achievement in the sport was playing in the 1876 FA Cup Final with the Old Etonians F.C., as a defender, which they lost to the Wanderers on a replay. When picked for England he had been representing Cambridge University.

From September 1939 to mid-1942 Britain led Allied efforts in multiple global military theatres. Commonwealth, Colonial and Imperial Indian forces, totalling close to 15 million serving men and women, fought the German, Italian, Japanese and other Axis armies, air-forces and navies across Europe, Africa, Asia, and in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic, Indian, Pacific and Arctic Oceans. Commonwealth forces based in Britain operated across Northwestern Europe in the effort to slow or stop Axis advances. Commonwealth airforces fought the Luftwaffe to a standstill over Britain, and Commonwealth armies fought and destroyed Italian forces in North and East Africa and occupied several overseas colonies of German-occupied European nations. Following successful engagements against Axis forces, Commonwealth troops invaded and occupied Libya, Italian Somaliland, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and Madagascar.Ashley7 Jackson, The British Empire and the Second World War (2006). The Commonwealth defeated, held back or slowed the Axis powers for three years while mobilizing its globally- integrated economy, military, and industrial infrastructure to build what became, by 1942, the most extensive military apparatus of the war. These efforts came at the cost of 150,000 military deaths, 400,000 wounded, 100,000 prisoners, over 300,000 civilian deaths, and the loss of 70 major warships, 39 submarines, 3,500 aircraft, 1,100 tanks and 65,000 vehicles. During this period the Commonwealth built an enormous military and industrial capacity. Britain became the nucleus of the Allied war-effort in Western Europe, and hosted governments-in-exile in London to rally support in occupied Europe for the Allied cause. Canada delivered almost $4 billion in direct financial aid to the United Kingdom, and Australia and New Zealand began shifting to domestic production to provide material aid to US forces in the Pacific. Following the US entry into the war in December 1941, the Commonwealth and the United States coordinated their military efforts and resources globally. As the scale of the US military involvement and industrial production increased, the US undertook command in many theatres, relieving Commonwealth forces for duty elsewhere, and expanding the scope and intensity of Allied military efforts.Stacey, C P. (1970)Edgerton, David (2011) Co-operation with the Soviet Union also developed. However, it proved difficult to co-ordinate the defence of far-flung colonies and Commonwealth countries from simultaneous attacks by the Axis powers. In part this difficulty was exacerbated by disagreements over priorities and objectives, as well as over the deployment and control of joint forces. The governments of Britain and Australia, in particular, turned to the United States for support. Although the British Empire and the Commonwealth countries all emerged from the war as victors, and the conquered territories returned to British rule, the costs of the war and the nationalist fervour that it had stoked became a catalyst for the decolonisation which took place in the following decades. Compare: Compare:  Pre-war plans for defence  From 1923, defence of British colonies and protectorates in East Asia and Southeast Asia was centred on the \\"Singapore strategy\\". This made the assumption that Britain could send a fleet to its naval base in Singapore within two or three days of a Japanese attack, while relying on France to provide assistance in Asia via its colony in Indochina and, in the event of war with Italy, to help defend British territories in the Mediterranean.Louis, p. 315 Pre-war planners did not anticipate the fall of France: Nazi occupation, the loss of control over the Channel, and the employment of French Atlantic ports as forward bases for U-boats directly threatened Britain itself, forcing a significant reassessment of naval defence priorities. During the 1930s, a triple threat emerged for the British Commonwealth in the form of right-wing, militaristic governments in Germany, Italy and Japan.Brown, p. 284 Germany threatened Britain itself, while Italy and Japan's imperial ambitions looked set to clash with the British imperial presence in the Mediterranean and East Asia respectively. However, there were differences of opinion within the UK and the Dominions as to which posed the most serious threat, and whether any attack would come from more than one power at the same time.  Declaration of war against Germany  Sir Robert Menzies broadcasting to Australia the news of the outbreak of war, 1939 On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. Two days later, on 3 September, after a British ultimatum to Germany to cease military operations was ignored, Britain and France declared war on Germany. Britain's declaration of war automatically committed India, the Crown colonies, and the protectorates, but the 1931 Statute of Westminster had granted autonomy to the Dominions so each decided their course separately. Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies immediately joined the British declaration on 3 September, believing that it applied to all subjects of the Empire and Commonwealth. New Zealand followed suit simultaneously, at 9.30 pm on 3 September (local time), after Peter Fraser consulted the Cabinet; although as Chamberlain's broadcast was drowned by static, the Cabinet (led by Fraser as Prime Minister Michael Savage was terminally ill) delayed until the Admiralty announced to the fleet a state of war, then backdated the declaration to 9.30 pm. South Africa took three days to make its decision (on 6 September), as the Prime Minister General J. B. M. Hertzog favoured neutrality but was defeated by the pro-war vote in the Union Parliament, led by General Jan Smuts, who then replaced Hertzog. Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King declared support for Britain on the day of the British declaration, but also stated that it was for Parliament to make the formal declaration, which it did so one week later on 10 September. Ireland, which had been a dominion until 1937, remained neutral.Brown, pp. 307‚Äì9  Empire and Commonwealth contribution  British Empire and Commonwealth forms of government and production c 1940 Kenya Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve 1945 While the war was initially intended to be limited, resources were mobilized quickly, and the first shots were fired almost immediately.

A further 26 convoys of 527 ships sailed from Canada in the first four months of the war,Hague, 2000 and by 1 January 1940 Canada had landed an entire division in Britain.Byers, p.26 On 13 June 1940 Canadian troops deployed to France in an attempt to secure the southern flank of the British Expeditionary Force in Belgium. As the fall of France grew imminent, Britain looked to Canada to rapidly provide additional troops to strategic locations in North America, the Atlantic and Caribbean. Following the Canadian destroyer already on station from 1939, Canada provided troops from May 1940 to assist in the defence of the British Caribbean colonies, with several companies serving throughout the war in Bermuda, Jamaica, the Bahamas and British Guiana. Canadian troops were also sent to the defence of the colony of Newfoundland, on Canada's east coast, the closest point in North America to Germany. Fearing the loss of a land link to the British Isles, Canada was also requested to occupy Iceland, which it did from June 1940 to the spring of 1941, following the initial British invasion.Stacey 1970 From mid-June 1940, following the rapid German invasions and occupations of Poland, Denmark, Norway, France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, the British Commonwealth was the main opponent of Germany and the Axis, until the entry into the war of the Soviet Union in June 1941. During this period Australia, India, New Zealand and South Africa provided dozens of ships and several divisions for the defence of the Mediterranean, Greece, Crete, Lebanon and Egypt, where British troops were outnumbered four to one by the Italian armies in Libya and Ethiopia.McIntyre pp. 336‚Äì7Grey (2008). pp. 156‚Äì164. Canada delivered a further 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, pilots for two air squadrons, and several warships to Britain to face a possible invasion from the continent. In December 1941, Japan launched, in quick succession, attacks on British Malaya, the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, and Hong Kong. Substantial financial support was provided by Canada to the UK and Commonwealth dominions, in the form of over $4 billion in aid through the Billion Dollar Gift and Mutual Aid and the War Appropriation Act. Over the course of the war over 1.6 million Canadians served in uniform (out of a prewar population of 11 million), in almost every theatre of the war, and by war's end the country had the third- largest navy and fourth-largest air force in the world. By the end of the war, almost a million Australians had served in the armed forces (out of a population of under 7 million), whose military units fought primarily in Europe, North Africa, and the South West Pacific. The British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (also known as the \\"Empire Air Training Scheme\\") was established by the governments of Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK resulting in: * joint training at flight schools in Canada, Southern Rhodesia, Australia and New Zealand;Brown, p. 310 * formation of new squadrons of the Dominion air forces, known as \\"Article XV squadrons\\" for service as part of Royal Air Force operational commands, and; * in practice, the pooling of RAF and Dominion air force personnel, for posting to both RAF and Article XV squadrons. =Finances= Britain borrowed everywhere it could and made heavy purchases of munitions and supplies in India and Canada during the war, as well as other parts of the Empire and neutral countries. Canada also made gifts. Britain's sterling balances around the world amounted to ¬£3.4 billion in 1945 or the equivalent of about $US 200 billion in 2016 dollars.See \\"Pounds Sterling to Dollars: Historical Conversion of Currency\\" However, Britain treated this as a long-term loan with no interest and no specified repayment date. Just when the money would be made available by London was an issue, for the British treasury was nearly empty by 1945.Marcelo de Paiva Abreu, \\"India as a creditor: sterling balances, 1940‚Äì1953.\\" (Department of Economics, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, 2015) online  Crisis in the Mediterranean  Second Officer Kalyani Sen and Chief Officer Margaret L Cooper, Women's Royal Indian Naval Service, 1945 In June 1940, France surrendered to invading German forces, and Italy joined the war on the Axis side, causing a reversal of the Singapore strategy. Winston Churchill, who had replaced Neville Chamberlain as British Prime Minister the previous month (see Norway debate), ordered that the Middle East and the Mediterranean were of a higher priority than the Far East to defend.Louis, p. 335 Australia and New Zealand were told by telegram that they should turn to the United States for help in defending their homeland should Japan attack:McIntyre p. 339 Commonwealth forces played a major role in North and East Africa following Italy's entry to the war, participating in the invasion of Italian Libya and Somaliland, but were forced to retreat after Churchill diverted resources to Greece and Crete.McIntyre p. 337  Fall of Singapore  The Battle of Singapore was fought in the South- East Asian theatre of World War II when the Japanese Empire invaded British Malaya and its stronghold of Singapore. Singapore was the major British military base in South East Asia and nicknamed the \\"Gibraltar of the East\\". The fighting in Singapore lasted from 31 January 1942 to 15 February 1942. It followed a humiliating naval engagement in December 1941 in which two British capital ships were sunk. It resulted in the fall of Singapore to the Japanese, and the largest surrender of British-led military personnel in history. About 80,000 British, Australian and Indian troops became prisoners of war, joining 50,000 taken by the Japanese in the Malayan campaign. Britain's Prime Minister Winston Churchill called the ignominious fall of Singapore to the Japanese the \\"worst disaster\\" and \\"largest capitulation\\" in British history.Churchill, Winston (1986). The Hinge of Fate, Volume 4. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, p. 81.  Africa  British (red) and Belgian (Orange) colonies fought with the Allies. Italian (green) with the Axis. French colonies (dark blue) fought with the Allies until the Fall of France after which some supported Vichy and some the Free French. Portuguese (brown) and Spanish (teal) colonies remained neutral. Africa was a large continent whose geography gave it strategic importance during the war. North Africa was the scene of major campaigns against Italy and Germany; East Africa was the scene of a major campaign against Italy. The vast geography provided major transportation routes linking the United States to the Middle East and Mediterranean regions. The sea route around South Africa was heavily used even though it added 40 days to voyages that had to avoid the dangerous Suez region. Lend Lease supplies to Russia often came this way. Internally, long-distance road and railroad connections facilitated the British war effort. The Union of South Africa was part of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and had been an independent self-governing country since 1931.The term \\"Commonwealth\\" was popularised during World War I and became official after the Balfour Declaration in 1926. The Statute of Westminster 1931 gave legal status to the independence of Australia, Canada, Irish Free State, Newfoundland, New Zealand and South Africa. After the Statute of Westminster was passed in 1931, the Dominions were \\"as independent as they wished to be\\". W. David McIntyre, 1999, \\"The Commonwealth\\"; in Robin Winks (ed.), The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume V: Historiography, Oxford University Press, p. 558-560. ] The British \\"possessions\\" in Africa were ruled by the colonial office, usually with close ties to local chiefs and kings. France had extensive possessions in Africa, but they played a much smaller role in the war, since they were largely tied to Vichy France. Portuguese holdings played a minor role. Italian holdings were the target of successful British military campaigns. The Belgian Congo, and two other Belgian colonies, were major exporters. In terms of numbers and wealth, the British controlled the richest portions of Africa, and made extensive use not only of the geography, but the manpower, and the natural resources. Civilian colonial officials made a special effort to upgrade the African infrastructure, promote agriculture, integrate colonial Africa with the world economy, and recruit over a half million soldiers.Ashley Jackson, The British Empire and the Second World War (2006) 171‚Äì239.David Killingray and Richard Rathbone, edfs. Africa and the Second World War (1986). Before the war, Britain had made few plans for the utilization of Africa, but it quickly set up command structures. The Army set up the West Africa Command, which recruited 200,000 soldiers. The East Africa Command was created in September 1941 to support the overstretched Middle East Command. The Southern Command was the domain of South Africa. The Royal Navy set up the South Atlantic Command based in Sierra Leone, that became one of the main convoy assembly points. The RAF Coastal Command had major submarine-hunting operations based in West Africa, while a smaller RAF command Dealt with submarines in the Indian Ocean. Ferrying aircraft from North America and Britain was the major mission of the Western Desert Air Force. In addition smaller more localized commands were set up throughout the war.Jackson, The British Empire and the Second World War (2006) 175-77. Before the war, the military establishments were very small throughout British Africa, and largely consisted of whites, who comprised only two percent of the population outside Africa. As soon as the war began, newly created African units were set up, primarily by the Army. The new recruits were almost always volunteers, usually provided in close cooperation with local tribal leaders. During the war, military pay scales far exceeded what civilians natives could earn, especially when food, housing and clothing allowances are included. The largest numbers were in construction units, called Pioneer Units, with over 82,000 soldiers. The RAF and Navy also did some recruiting. East Africa provided the largest number of men, over 320,000, chiefly from Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda. They did some fighting, a great deal of guard duty, and construction work. 80,000 served in the Middle East. A special effort was made not to challenge white supremacy, certainly before the war, and to a large extent during the war itself. Nevertheless, the soldiers were drilled and train to European standards, given strong doses of propaganda, and learn leadership and organizational skills that proved essential to the formation of nationalistic and independence movements after 1945. There were minor episodes of discontent, but nothing serious, among the natives.Jackson, The British Empire and the Second World War (2006) pp 180‚Äì189. Afrikaner nationalism was a factor in South Africa, But the pro- German Afrikaner prime minister was replaced in 1939 by Jan Smuts, an Afrikaner who was an enthusiastic supporter of the British Empire. His government closely cooperated with London and raised 340,000 volunteers (190,000 were white, or about one-third of the eligible white men).Jackson, The British Empire and the Second World War (2006) pp 240‚Äì45.  India  volunteer army in history Serious tension erupted over American support for independence for India, a proposition Churchill vehemently rejected.William Roger Louis, Imperialism at Bay: The United States and the Decolonization of the British Empire, 1941‚Äì1945 (1978).Andrew N. Buchanan, \\"The War Crisis and the Decolonization of India, December 1941 ‚Äì September 1942: A Political and Military Dilemma.\\" Global War Studies 8#2 (2011): 5‚Äì31. For years Roosevelt had encouraged Britain's disengagement from India. The American position was based on principled opposition to colonialism.Kenton J. Clymer, \\"Franklin D. Roosevelt, Louis Johnson, India, and Anticolonialism: Another Look.\\" Pacific Historical Review 57#3 (1988): 261‚Äì284. online The politically active Indian population was deeply divided.Yasmin Khan, The Raj at War: A People's History of India's Second World War (2016) One element was so insistent on the expulsion of the British, that it sided with Germany and Japan, and formed the Indian National Army (INA) from Indian prisoners of war. It fought as part of the Japanese invasion of Burma and eastern India. There was a large pacifist element, which rallied to Gandhi's call for abstention from the war; he said that violence in every form was evil. There was a high level of religious tension between the Hindu majority and the Muslims minority. For the first time the Muslim community became politically active, giving strong support for the British war effort. Over 2 million Indians volunteered for military service, including a large Muslim contingent. The British were sensitive to demands of the Muslim League, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, since it needed Muslim soldiers in India and Muslim support all across the Middle East. London used the religious tensions in India as a justification to continue its rule, saying it was needed to prevent religious massacres of the sort that did happen in 1947. The imperialist element in Britain was strongly represented in the Conservative party; Churchill himself had long been its leading spokesman. On the other hand, Attlee and the Labour Party favoured independence and had close ties to the Congress Party. The British cabinet sent Sir Stafford Cripps to India with a specific peace plan offering India the promise of dominion status after the war. Congress demanded independence immediately and the Cripps mission failed. Roosevelt gave support to Congress, sending his representative Louis Johnson to help negotiate some sort of independence. Churchill was outraged, refused to cooperate with Roosevelt on the issue, and threatened to resign as prime minister if Roosevelt pushed too hard. Roosevelt pulled back. In 1942 when the Congress Party launched a Quit India Movement of non-violent civil disobedience, the Raj police immediately arrested tens of thousands of activists (including Gandhi), holding them for the duration. Meanwhile, wartime disruptions caused severe food shortages in eastern India; hundreds of thousands died of starvation. To this day a large Indian element blames Churchill for the Bengal famine of 1943.John Hickman, \\"Orwellian Rectification: Popular Churchill Biographies and the 1943 Bengal Famine.\\" Studies in History 24#2 (2008): 235‚Äì243. In terms of the war effort, India became a major base for American supplies sent to China, and Lend Lease operations boosted the local economy. The 2 million Indian soldiers were a major factor in British success in the Middle East. Muslim support for the British war effort proved decisive in the British decision to partition the Raj, forming of the new state of Pakistan.Eric S. Rubin, \\"America, Britain, and Swaraj: Anglo-American Relations and Indian Independence, 1939‚Äì1945,\\" India Review\\" (Jan‚ÄìMarch 2011) 10#1 pp 40‚Äì80  Victory  The Montreal Daily Star announcing the German surrender. 7 May 1945 On 8 May 1945, the World War II Allies formally accepted the unconditional surrender of the armed forces of Nazi Germany and the end of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. The formal surrender of the occupying German forces in the Channel Islands was not until 9 May 1945. On 30 April Hitler committed suicide during the Battle of Berlin, and so the surrender of Germany was authorized by his replacement, President of Germany Karl D√∂nitz. The act of military surrender was signed on 7 May in Reims, France, and ratified on 8 May in Berlin, Germany. In the afternoon of 15 August 1945, the Surrender of Japan occurred, effectively ending World War II. On this day the initial announcement of Japan's surrender was made in Japan, and because of time zone differences it was announced in the United States, Western Europe, the Americas, the Pacific Islands, and Australia/New Zealand on 14 August 1945. The signing of the surrender document occurred on 2 September 1945.  Aftermath  By the end of the war in August 1945, British Commonwealth forces were responsible for the civil and/or military administration of a number of non-Commonwealth territories, occupied during the war, including Eritrea, Libya, Madagascar, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Italian Somaliland, Syria, Thailand and portions of Germany, Austria and Japan. Most of these military administrations were handed over to old European colonial authorities or to new local authorities soon after the end of the hostilities. Commonwealth forces administered occupation zones in Japan, Germany and Austria until 1955. World War II confirmed that Britain was no longer the great power it had once been, and that it had been surpassed by the United States on the world stage. Canada, Australia and New Zealand moved within the orbit of the United States. The image of imperial strength in Asia had been shattered by the Japanese attacks, and British prestige there was irreversibly damaged.McIntyre, p. 341 The price for India's entry to the war had been effectively a guarantee for independence, which came within two years of the end of the war, relieving Britain of its most populous and valuable colony. The deployment of 150,000 Africans overseas from British colonies, and the stationing of white troops in Africa itself led to revised perceptions of the Empire in Africa.McIntyre, p. 342  Historiography  In terms of actual engagement with the enemy, historians have recounted a great deal in South Asia and Southeast Asia, as summarized by Ashley Jackson: :Terror, mass migration, shortages, inflation, blackouts, air raids, massacres, famine, forced labour, urbanization, environmental damage, occupation [by the enemy], resistance, collaboration ‚Äì all of these dramatic and often horrific phenomena shaped the war experience of Britain's imperial subjects.Ashley Jackson, \\"The British Empire\\" in British historians of the Second World War have not emphasized the critical role played by the Empire in terms of money, manpower and imports of food and raw materials.for survey see Ashley Jackson, \\"The British Empire and the Second World War\\" online For comprehensive coverage and up-to-date bibliography see \\"The British Empire at War Research Group\\" The powerful combination meant that Britain did not stand alone against Germany, it stood at the head of a great but fading empire. As Ashley Jackson has argued,\\" The story of the British Empire's war, therefore, is one of Imperial success in contributing toward Allied victory on the one hand, and egregious Imperial failure on the other, as Britain struggled to protect people and defeat them, and failed to win the loyalty of colonial subjects.\\"Ashley Jackson, \\"The British Empire, 1939‚Äì1945 \\" in Richard J. B. Bosworth and Joseph A. Maiolo, eds., The Cambridge History of the Second World War: Volume II Politics and Ideology (2015) pp 558‚Äì580, quote on p 559. The contribution in terms of soldiers numbered 2.5 million men from India, over 1 million from Canada, just under 1 million from Australia, 410,000 from South Africa, and 215,000 from New Zealand. In addition, the colonies mobilized over 500,000 uniformed personnel who serve primarily inside Africa.Jackson, p 563. In terms of financing, the British war budget included ¬£2.7 billion borrowed from the Empire's Sterling Area, And eventually paid back. Canada made C$3 billion in gifts and loans on easy terms. Military histories of the British Empire's colonies, dominions, mandates and protectorates The contributions from individual colonies, dominions, mandates, and protectorates to the war effort were extensive and global.

Also starting in the late fifties Mongiardino began his career as ‚Äúproduction designer‚Äù in Theatre and Cinema together with Franco Zeffirelli, Peter Hall, Giancarlo Menotti and Raymond Rouleau. In 1993, Rizzoli published ‚ÄúRoomscapes‚Äù, a lessons-learned monograph about Mongiardino in which revealed some of his standards of interior design, without forgetting his irreplaceable craftsmen and assistants able to transform his aesthetic dreams into reality; united to his ‚Äúelective affinity that arrives after years of cooperation and in continuous exercise of affectionate understanding‚Äù. After the arson of theatre \\"La Fenice\\" in 1996, Gae Aulenti assigned Mongiardino the project for the interior theatre refurbishment, a project which he was not able to complete. Mongiardino died in Milan on 16 January 1998. Style  The years of Mongiardino‚Äôs debut are those of the Modern Movement, but he resisted this new wave, fearing its effects, and perceiving an intrinsic lack of feeling. Instinct took him elsewhere, to seek the harmony of the antique that draws on and re-invents itself in a completely new way. The private nature of his projects and their nature, in the sense that they are an ends unto themselves, and will most likely not survive beyond the lives of their owners, brings with it the risk that Mongiardino‚Äôs name may not correspond to anything definite, but true only as evocation of the rich and famous world. There are in fact several public works of Mongiardino, including two buildings built in Milan (in Via Donizetti and in via Borgonuovo), the restoration of several important hotels (the lobby bar at The Carlyle in New York, The Hotel Kulm in St. Moritz, The Plaza in Rome), as well as the restaurant (\\"Da Giacomo\\" in Milan) and several shops, including Sabbadini Jewelers on Milan's Via Montenapoleone. But these works are the exception that the primary focus of Mongiardino‚Äôs research, which was addressed almost exclusively to the preparation of domestic spaces, through a careful combination of the search for harmonious proportions and a love for the meticulous execution of every detail. Before Mongiardino, houses were built in a particular historical style. Mongiardino revolutionized this methodology. He writes: \\"The houses are furnished, are created considering the structure, the skeleton, the intrinsic beauty, when there is. We believe we can invent a new house, a universal model that could be replicated identically in Naples as in Stockholm. But the house is not an invention, it is always the same shelter that man needs because he is tired, because he's hungry, because he has to sleep. Older houses were built on the extent of these practical needs, they expressed the authenticity of the goods and used the same limits imposed by available materials and technologies called for the pursuit of beauty in function. Skilled creator of spectacular spaces, he has been able to juxtapose ordinary objects and antiques, in a masterly game of fabrics or painted, and sculptured panels and a range of trompe l'≈ìil, whereby he obtained masterpieces with poor materials. Fundamental in his work, however, is the determination of space, the search for a balance of proportions that must precede the decoration. Precisely this is his book \\"Roomscapes‚Äù. Only later Mongiardino inserted, with the sensitivity set designer, fakes and real objects presented without any hierarchy of values in a setting in which each subject was taking its natural space.
