It is a monastery for nuns dedicated to the Dormition of Virgin Mary, or Theotokos. It was constructed in 1530 by Voievod Petru Rareş and his chancellor Teodor Bubuiog. The monastery was built over the foundation of a previous monastery that dated from around 1415. The Humor monastery was closed in 1786 and was not reopened until 1990. The church has been inscribed by UNESCO on its list of World Heritage Sites, as one of the Painted churches of Moldavia. Frescoes Humor was one of the first of Moldavia's painted monasteries to be frescoed and, along with Voroneţ, is probably the best preserved. The dominant colour of the frescoes is a reddish brown. The master painter responsible for Humor's frescoes, which were painted in 1535, is one Toma of Suceava. The subjects of the frescoes at Humor include the Siege of Constantinople and the Last Judgment, common on the exterior of the painted monasteries of Bucovina, but also the Hymn to the Virgin inspired by the poem of Patriarch Sergius of Constantinople relating to the miraculous intervention of the Theotokos in saving the city from Persian conquest in 626. The Persians are, however, depicted as Turks which is a common device in these monasteries, their paintings being used in part for political propaganda in addition to their spiritual meaning.

While Barrington has grown substantially over the past decade, it has experienced tough economic times because of a shortage of lobster (the primary industry). A causeway to Cape Sable Island, just south of the community, was opened in 1949 to replace the ferry service, which had had to run through heavy currents. A bridge had been considered but was rejected. Since then, sand has been collecting on the east side of the causeway, making a beach on Cape Sable Island that has nearly connected to the mainland. It is called North East Point Beach.

The Rugby league club Leeds Rhinos were previously nicknamed the Loiners. History While there are several theories, the actual origin of the term remains uncertain. The three competing theories are: * Loiner could derive from the name Loidis (in use by the eighth century for the district around modern-day Leeds). * Another explanation says that in the 19th century there were many yards and closes around Briggate whose back entrances were known as Low Ins or Loins, hence Loiner. * A third theory is that, in the area of Briggate, locals referred to numerous nearby streets as 'loins’, as a Leeds cognate for the Standard English word 'lanes'. People who gathered in these loins to gossip were therefore termed Loiners.

The song includes the verse \\"Well, I'm a-standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona and such a fine sight to see. It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford slowin' down to take a look at me.\\" The park contains a two-story trompe-l'œil mural by John Pugh, and a bronze statue by Ron Adamson of a life-sized man who is standing on a corner with a guitar by his side. The park is surrounded by a wall of bricks, with windows to peer into; each brick has a donor's name on it, and a story by each of the donors describing their fondness for Winslow, Arizona. The Arizona US Route 66 marker at Standing on the Corner Park Winslow, Arizona  History  Until the 1960s, Winslow was a thriving town in northern Arizona just off Route 66. Construction of the $7.7 million bypass around Winslow began soon after 1977. When I-40 bypassed the community many local businesses disappeared, the tourism sector being among the hardest hit. While some local jobs remained (as Winslow is the base of operation for one thousand railroad workers), the local downtown was badly hurt by the influx of national chains (such as Walmart and McDonald's) along the new interstate highway to the north of the town. Twenty years passed and Winslow was stuck in a commercial rut. In 1997, the La Posada Hotel (a former Harvey House on the Santa Fe Railroad, long at risk for demolition) was restored and reopened. Listing of La Posada Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places served as a first step toward re-awakening the town. The Standin' on the Corner Foundation was formed to create a renaissance of Winslow. Determined to build on tourism, the foundation took advantage of the town being mentioned in the song \\"Take It Easy\\" made famous by the Eagles. From 1997 until 1999, the foundation was busy finding donors and planning design concepts. On September 10 and 11, 1999 the park was opened to the public. The 2006 release of animated film Cars brought renewed attention to the efforts to save local U.S. Route 66 main street businesses in towns long bypassed. While Winslow itself is not depicted on-screen, the movie's credits list both La Posada Hotel and Diane Patterson's souvenir shop at Standin' on the Corner Park among the many Mother Road locations at which Pixar studio personnel conducted exhaustive interviews as part of extensive research for the film. On October 18, 2004, there was a fire at the Standin' on the Corner Park. While the face of the building and the actual corner survived, the rest of the building was burned down. In September 2016, a statue was unveiled at the park in the likeness of Glenn Frey, who died earlier that year.

Plot Dax Xenos, a ten-year old boy in the South American country of Corteguay, witnesses the rape and murder of his mother by government soldiers and runs to his father, Jaime, who is with a band of revolutionaries. Jaime's men capture the government soldiers, give Dax the privilege of personally executing his mother's murderers, and then take the boy to their hideout in the mountains where he meets Amparo, the daughter of revolutionary leader Rojo. After the rebels oust the dictator and establish Rojo as president, Dax accompanies his father to Rome, where Jaime is to serve as ambassador. Years later, Jaime returns to Corteguay to find that Rojo has established himself as dictator; he contacts El Condor, the new revolutionary leader, but is killed by Colonel Gutierrez, Rojo's security chief. Dax, now a young man, returns to Corteguay for his father's funeral. Rojo persuades Dax, who does not know the cause of his father's death, to convince El Condor to surrender, but when El Condor surrenders, he is killed by Gutierrez. Because his promise to El Condor was betrayed, Dax murders Gutierrez, confronts Rojo with his treachery, and returns to Rome. He becomes a gigolo and finally marries millionairess Sue Anne Daley, but they soon divorce. Dax again returns to Corteguay, this time for the unveiling of a statue of his father, and finds himself thrust into yet another revolution. Led this time by El Lobo, the revolution succeeds when Dax murders Rojo. Meanwhile, Dax learns that Amparo has borne him a son. Delighted, he sends her back to Rome with the intention of establishing a democracy in Corteguay and returning to his new family, but he is assassinated by the vengeful son of El Condor. Cast Music The score was composed by Bossa nova songwriter Antonio Carlos Jobim. Of the 12 songs featured in this film, three of them, \\"Children's Games\\" (Chovendo na Roseira), \\"A Bed of Flowers For Sue Ann\\" (Sue Ann) and \\"Dax & Amparo-Love Theme\\" (Olha Maria), went on to become some of Jobim's signature songs. These songs were heard for the first time on this soundtrack. The soft and often tender music stands in stark contrast to the darkness of the themes of the story. A rare track by British band Family called \\"Young Love\\" was featured as a backing track to a fashion show in the film. This track does not appear on a CD by Family or on any singles. Release and reception The Adventurers had a special \\"airborne world premiere\\" on February 23, 1970, as the in-flight movie of a TWA Boeing 747 Superjet making its premiere voyage, flying from New York to Los Angeles, with the film's stars and members of the press aboard. It marked the first time that a movie and a plane premiered in the same event.Moore, Ethel Mae (March 14, 1970). \\"Comfort, Luxury on TWA's New 747\\". The Chicago Defender. 38. A wide release took place at over 100 U.S. theaters on March 25, 1970. The pre-wide release version ran 205 minutes and was negatively received by the press; Paramount re-cut the film at the last minute but several critics, including Pauline Kael and Joe Morgenstern, could not be convinced to watch it a second time. Howard Thompson of The New York Times opened his review by stating, \\"On the screen, 'The Adventurers' turn out to be an even duller bunch of meatballs than they were in Harold Robbins's best-selling novel.\\"Thompson, Howard (March 26, 1970). \\"Harold Robbins's 'Adventurers' Whoops Across Three Screens\\". The New York Times. 58. Arthur D. Murphy of Variety called it \\"a classic monument to bad taste ... marked by profligate and squandered production opulence; inferior, imitative and curiously old-hat direction; banal, ludicrous dialog; sub-standard, lifeless and embarrassing acting; cornball music; indulgent, gratuitous and boring violence; and luridly non- erotic sex.\\"Murphy, Arthur D. (March 25, 1970). \\"Film Reviews: The Adventurers\\". Variety. 18. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 1 star out of 4 and wrote, \\"'The Adventurers' has nothing to recommend it. It is not erotic. It is not funny.

Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 15. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times stated that the film \\"is blatant in its borrowing from the more sensational headlines and naked in its manipulation of emotions to the susceptible,\\" adding that \\"Gilbert is nothing if not consistent: the acting and the relentlessly risible dialogue are uniformly terrible.\\"Thomas, Kevin (March 25, 1970). \\"'Adventurers' Opens on Various Screens\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 19. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote, \\"Unfortunately, Lewis Gilbert's film version of the novel is quite faithful to the letter and spirit of the original. It alternates from slaughter to torpor to sex to torpor and back again to slaughter. Whatever the mode, the scenes are usually hideous or clumsy on their own terms and useless as clues to subsequent events or the characters' motives.\\"Arnold, Gary (March 27, 1970). \\"'Adventurers' Goes Nowhere\\". The Washington Post. B10. The Monthly Film Bulletin called it \\"A three-hour slog through every imaginable cliché of writing and direction\\" and further remarked, \\"This might be described as the film with everything; trouble is, it is difficult to imagine anybody wanting any of it.\\" By the 2000s, reviews have found The Adventurers entertaining as an unintentional comedy. In 2005, it was listed in The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of the Top Ten Best Bad films of all time, with author John Wilson writing that the movie \\"ha[s] not even one believable character, performance, or line of dialogue. But it’s all done with such utter sincerity that it’s far more entertaining than this same material would be in the hands of anyone but utter incompetents.\\" Paul Mavis, reviewing the Warner Archive DVD release, enjoyed its outrageousness, stating The Adventurers is, \\"part faux-David Lean, part lurid comic book with funny accents and naked breasts--and all of it an irresistible, frequently maddening mess.\\"https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/62096/adventurers-1970-warner-archive- collection-the/ Director Lewis Gilbert said on June 25, 2010, on the BBC radio programme Desert Island Discs, that The Adventurers was \\"a big, sprawling, very expensive film which was a disaster. I should never have made it. It's one I'm not proud of.\\" Home media Paramount Home Entertainment first released the film on a widescreen DVD on July 12, 2005. The same company rereleased the film in the Warner Archive Collection on September 24, 2013.

The IP in IPSO refers to Ipsilon Networks, a company specialising in IP switching acquired by Nokia in 1997. In 2009, Check Point acquired the Nokia security appliance business, including IPSO, from Nokia.  Variations  IPSO, now at version 6.2, is a fork of FreeBSD 6. There were two other systems, called IPSO-SX and IPSO-LX, that were Linux- based: * IPSO SX was Nokia's first release of a Linux-based IPSO, and was deployed in 2002 on the now-defunct Message Protector,http://www.nokia.com/A4136001?newsid=880176 and briefly thereafter on a short-lived appliance version of the \\"Nokia Access Mobilizer\\", acquired from Eizel. It had a partitioning scheme somewhat reminiscent of IPSO SB, a LILO configuration and boot manager also somewhat inspired by IPSO SB, and a software package installer that made RPM packaging look more familiar to a Nokia IPSO administrator. It did not, however, include a full configuration database or Voyager web interface, the two things that normally define IPSO. * IPSO LX is a nearly vanilla Gentoo-based Linux OS,http://www.secinfo.com/dsvRq.uu2.a.htm and is used on Nokia appliances sold with Sourcefire 3D. It includes a full Voyager and database implementation—in fact, the Voyager look and feel in IPSO SB 4.0 onwards was based on that implemented for IPSO LX. Check Point offers three lines of security appliances - one based on IPSO 6.x, one based on an operating system called SecurePlatform and the latest based on Gaia platform (RHEL4 based). = Features = IPSO notable features or firsts include: * Effective firewall load-balancing (in conjunction with Check Point synchronization), derived from Network Alchemy clustering technology, predating and still independently developed from Check Points ClusterXL. * The first commercial IPv6 router out of beta-testing (ahead of Cisco and Juniper Networks) * Firewall Flows for putting Check Point security rule implementation into the dedicated network processor circuitry on-the-fly (though this is now largely evolved into Check Point's SecureXL) = Versions = IPSO SB was originally derived by Ipsilon Networks from FreeBSD 2.1-STABLE and cross-compiled on FreeBSD 2.2.6-RELEASE and 3.5-RELEASE platforms. Its major components are: * A configuration database held in memory by the \\"xpand\\" daemon, that creates legacy UNIX configuration in /etc on-the-fly. * A partitioning scheme which places a mini- IPSO in a separate boot manager partition for recovery * A partition-slicing scheme which segregates read-only and read-write content * A software packaging scheme which requires all packages to remain in a single location under /opt * A web interface, Voyager, which was closely integrated with the configuration database. (It has now diverged somewhat.) IPSO versions up to 2.x were sold by Ipsilon Networks as part of the ATM tag-switching solutions that they originally pioneered. IPSO 3.0 onwards were designed to host Check Point FireWall-1 and other third party packages. IPSO 3.0 to 3.9 spanned from 1999 to 2005 and, while adding many features and significant performance and hardware refinements, were recognizably the same to the administrator. IPSO 4.0 was not designed as a major update and was internally numbered as IPSO 3.10. However, Check Point software was unable to process a two-digit dot version, and it also included a refresh of the Voyager HTML interface. Up to that point, JavaScript and frames had been avoided in order to facilitate the use of Lynx as a command line interface. These together resulted in it being renumbered as 4.0. IPSO 4.1 and IPSO 4.2 are incremental releases. IPSO 4.2 will gain source-based routing as its last scheduled new feature. All new development will continue on IPSO 6.x. IPSO 5.0 build 056 was released in 2009 for VSX R65 support on IP Appliance. IPSO 6.0 was announced by Nokia in relation to the IP2450 and IP690 hardware. It is based on FreeBSD 6.x. Its primary advantage over IPSO 4.x are improved memory management, performance, scheduling, threading, POSIX-compliance, and other operating system features. IPSO 6.0.7 was released in 2009 for IP690 and IP2450 with CoreXL (multi-core) support. IPSO 6.1 contains other enhancements from FreeBSD 6.x but without CoreXL support. Because of the step change, Nokia advertised that IPSO 4.2, 6.07 and 6.1 will run alongside each other for a period of time. When Check Point acquired Nokia IP appliance business, 6.07 and 6.1 development branches were merged and combined to 6.2. Most recent version is IPSO 6.2MR6, released in February 2017.https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/supportcenter/portal?action=portlets.DCFileAction&eventSubmit;_doGetdcdetails=&fileid;=44605 For a while, Nokia offered IPSO 7, which was actually IPSO LX. It was discontinued after 7.2, in 2008. After acquiring the Nokia IP appliance business, Check Point announced project Gaia to combine both IPSO and Secure Platform. The first release is expected in 2011.

Nines is played by three people, and the object is to lower your score from 9 to zero.  Rules of Nines  = Dealing = All of the cards are dealt one at a time into four hands of thirteen cards. One hand is for each player, and the remaining hand is set aside as an extra hand that the players can pick up (Four players can play, but with no option to trade hands, and only three tricks required to 'book', or keep the same score). = The extra hand = After all the cards are dealt, each player can look at his hand and decide if he wants to trade it for the extra hand. The dealer has first choice of taking the hand, and then the choice moves to the left. Players to the left of the dealer may take the hand that someone else has already traded in if they so choose. = Playing = The object of game play is to take tricks. Trump goes in the following sequence: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades, No Trump (the first four are alphabetical). In some circles, the game runs Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs, No Trump.  Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades  Play starts with the player to the left of the dealer. Play always moves to the left around the table. The player who plays the highest card of the suit that was led is awarded the trick. Each player must follow suit if they can. If they are out of the suit that was led, they can either play a card from another suit (not the trump suit) and forfeit the trick, or they can play a trump card which will earn them the trick, provided nobody plays a higher trump. Play continues until 13 tricks are played, at which point all players will be out of cards.  The No Trump Hand  After the four trump hands, there is a hand that is played without trump. In this round, the tricks always go to the person who played the highest card of the same suit that was led. In all other aspects it is the same as regular play. So, for example, if the order of cards played was 10♦, K♠, Q♦, the trick would go to the person who played the queen. = Scoring = All players start the game with a score of nine, and the object is to bring one's score to zero (or lower). In each hand, the number of tricks a player has collected translates to the change that will happen to their score. If four tricks are collected, the score will remain the same. For each trick there is in excess of four, the player's score will go down by one. For each trick shy of four, the player's score will go up by one. So, three tricks will result in a score increase of one, six tricks will result in a score decrease of two, and it is possible to win the game in one hand by taking all 13 tricks, due to the score decrease of nine. This is quite rare. If you get three queens in a row it minuses points from your total score and adds points to other players total points.

Wailes was born at Hadley Wood on 6 March 1901, the son of Reginald and Florence Wailes; his father was a mechanical engineer. He was educated at Oundle School before becoming an engineering apprentice at Robey's of Lincoln. In 1924 following his apprenticeship he joined the family firm of George Wailes & Company. In 1923, while serving his apprenticeship with Robey, an engineering firm in Lincoln, he was asked by the then president of the Newcomen Society to record windmills in Lincolnshire. At the time English windmills were rapidly falling into disuse and being demolished, and it was felt that some attempt should be made to record this vanishing aspect of the English countryside. In 1929 he was appointed technical adviser to the newly formed Windmill Section (now the Mills Section) of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. In this post he visited numerous mills in England and developed a reputation as the leading British authority on them, presenting more than thirty papers to the Newcomen Society on mill-related subjects. He was also invited to report on mills overseas, notably in the United States, presenting a paper on the windmills of Long Island for the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities in 1935. He was also the consultant for the construction of Robertson's post mill at Colonial Williamsburg in the 1950s. Books followed, the most notable of which were Windmills in England (1948) and The English Windmill (1954), the latter in particular being considered the classic work on the subject. From 1963 to 1971 he was the lead consultant to the Industrial Monuments Survey then being undertaken by the Ministry of Works in an effort to identify historic industrial sites which were worthy of preservation under the Town and Country Planning Acts. In 1965 he represented United Kingdom at the first International Symposium of Molinology in Portugal. In 1971 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his work. He served as president of the Newcomen Society, 1953 to 1955, and was elected as an honorary member in 1977.  References  * * Major, J. Kenneth (1990).

Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two handed broadsword looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a longsword wielding amazon, Tyris Flare, whose parents were killed by Death Adder. Progress is made through the game by hacking and slashing your way through Adder's forces. Aiding the characters in this quest is their ability to cast spells that hurt all enemies on the screen. The force of this magic depends on the number of \\"bars\\" of magic power currently available. The bars are filled by collecting blue 'magic potions' found throughout the game. The male warrior Ax, limited to 4 bars, is able to cast Earth spells. The dwarf Gilius, limited to 3 bars, casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris can cast devastating fire magic, but her most powerful spell costs 6 bars. =Golden Axe II= Each of the heroes from the first game return to battle the forces of evil villain Dark Guld in this sequel. While Golden Axe II was a Mega Drive/Genesis exclusive from a development point of view, it saw limited arcade exposure in the MegaPlay series of arcade machines. Released in 1991, the game featured new magic for each of the heroes with the characteristic magic pots from the first game replaced by spell books this time around. Many video game magazine editors of the time expressed that the game was very likely rushed into production to give Sega another popular title to enable the Mega Drive/Genesis to compete with its new rival, the Super NES. In most respects this sequel was essentially the same as the original, though it had new sprites for enemy characters and new levels. Many fans were disappointed with this title as they were expecting more than a rehash of the first title. However, the title had the virtue of not straying too far from a successful formula and was still quite popular upon its release. =Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder= In 1992, Sega released Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder in arcades. Despite its popularity, the game remains an arcade exclusive as of 2019. Only Gilius Thunderhead makes a return, riding the back of new character Goah the giant. The rest of the cast is all new and includes Stern Blade the barbarian, Dora the female centaur, and Little Trix, a young lad who carries a pitch fork. The main enemy is once again Death Adder. As well as introducing multiple paths to the franchise, the magic aspect was adjusted. Though still found in the classic Golden Axe pots, the magic spells did not increase in power with the number of pots collected but required a set number to work. The Revenge of Death Adder was the only Golden Axe game in which one of the magic attacks was not offensive, as Little Trix grew apple trees with fruit that replenished health. At the game's end, Death Adder rises one more time. Gilius sacrifices his life to finally end Adder's. During the end cinematic Gilius is shown in a bar with every other character, and a banner appears saying, \\"See you Next Game!\\" =Golden Axe III= Released in 1993, after Revenge of the Death Adder, the third Golden Axe game on the Mega Drive was released only in Japan. However, the game was available for a while in North America on the Sega Channel, Sega's modem-based game downloading system. It was brought to Europe and North America on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console. The game's lineup of playable characters includes swordsman Kain Grinder (カイン・グリンダー), swordswoman Sarah Barn (サラ・バーン), giant Braoude Cragger (プラウド・クラッガー) and beastman Chronos \\"Evil\\" Lait (クロノス・”イビル”・レート). Gilius also appear as a non-playable character at the character select screen. In this game the object is to travel along a number of truly branching paths and eventually defeat the main boss of the game, the Prince of Darkness. The player can choose different branching paths in this game toward that objective just as in Revenge of Death Adder. However the paths in this game are more elaborate and do not loop back together. Many of the characters are good characters that were possessed, and once beaten they are freed. A king turned into an anthropomorphic eagle is a recurring boss who may possibly be Prince Hellbringer's right-hand man, and is playable in VS mode. As opposed to Golden Axe II, where the characters, moves, and controls remained largely the same, Golden Axe III brought many changes to the gameplay. The background scenery was less lush and colorful than in previous games, as were the sprites themselves. There was a greater variety of moves. Furthermore, there were several abilities unique to certain characters: for example, the Braoude could throw, while the Chronos and Sarah could double jump and wall jump. Finally, each character had a super-move with its own unique button combination. Some features were returned to the title that had been cut in previous sequels. Golden Axe III brought back the thieves from the original game, rather than the mages from Golden Axe II. Also, extra lives could be gained by freeing prisoners scattered throughout the levels. The magic system was returned to the original version where all pots are used at the same time, as opposed to the improved system in Golden Axe II that allowed the player to only use as many spellbooks as they wanted. Critics applauded Sega's decision not to release Golden Axe III in North America, speculating that the game's drab graphics and generally mediocre quality would have damaged the Sega Genesis's reputation. =Golden Axe: Beast Rider= The game is titled Golden Axe: Beast Rider and features the return of Tyris Flare, the female amazon warrior from the first installments of the series. Golden Axe: Beast Rider was released in October 2008. Spin-offs =Golden Axe Warrior= This Master System title tells another epic tale about the Golden Axe. It is an action-adventure game similar to The Legend of Zelda. The storyline continues the theme of the original Golden Axe games. The game's unit of currency is horns, and it is to be imagined that the hero cut these off of the enemies he killed. =Ax Battler: A Legend of Golden Axe= Released for the Game Gear, this action-adventure title follows the legend of the character Ax Battler. Unlike its console counterpart, it is based more on Zelda II: The Adventure of Link than the original game. The player moves around a top-view overworld and enemies randomly attack. However the player can not see them like in Zelda II. When a battle begins, the transitions to a platform-style fighting environment. After killing the foe (or the foe wounding them) the hero returns to the overworld. Unlike previous Golden Axe games, the player can learn new attacks and moves at the training dojos in each town. The currency in this game is pots, the traditional Golden Axe magic-usage item. Pots double as both currency and as an offensive attack. =Golden Axe: The Duel= Released in 1994 in the arcades and in 1995 for the Sega Saturn, Golden Axe: The Duel is a one-on-one fighting game featuring characters who appear to be descendants of some of the characters in the original game. Though the potion-dropping imp mechanic was praised, most dismissed the game as a decent but nondescript one-on-one fighter. Cancelled prototype The Sega Reborn project was originally planned for development by Sega Studios Australia in the early 2010s, which would have included 2.5D reboots of the original game, along with those of Streets of Rage and Altered Beast. However, the project cancelled after Sega Studios Australia closed down in 2013. As part of Sega's 60th anniversary celebration, a working proof-of- concept prototype of the planned Golden Axe reboot, posthumously titled Golden Axed: A Cancelled Prototype, received a limited one-day release on Steam on October 18, 2020.https://store.steampowered.com/app/1368460/Golden_Axed_A_Cancelled_Prototype/ Characters *Ax Battler is a barbarian hero. He uses a claymore while wearing a loincloth and blue boots as well as iron bracers and a gorget. He calls upon volcanic magic, deploying lava and powerful eruptive blasts. Ax's mother is murdered by Death Adder's forces, providing his motive in the original Golden Axe. Ax was given a solo game for the Sega Game Gear title Ax Battler: A Legend of Golden Axe, in which he is charged with saving another kingdom. Battler is the most balanced character, having a better striking range and less spell-power than Tyris, and more powerful magic but not the extended physical reach of Gilius. *Tyris Flare is an amazon who wields a cinquedea-type sword while wearing a chainmail bikini, bracers and red boots. Both her parents are murdered by Death Adder's forces, leading her to seek revenge in the first Golden Axe game. Her magic attacks are all fire-based, including the summoning of a giant, flame-spewing dragon. Tyris has the shortest range of the heroes, but possesses the most powerful spells. *Gilius Thunderhead is a bearded dwarf who (at least in the arcade version) actually commands the Golden Axe. He wears a green tunic, leather boots and a horned helmet. He seeks revenge in Golden Axe after his brother is murdered by Death Adder's forces, returning again to defeat Dark Guld in Golden Axe II. In Golden Axe III, Gilius is the only character from the previous games to appear, though he is not playable, he starts each of the characters off on their quest at the game's beginning. When Death Adder returns from the dead in Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder, Gilius rides on the back of playable character Goah throughout the game, and sacrifices his life at game's end to vanquish Death Adder once and for all. Gilius is granted the least powerful spells in the game, but has the best striking range in battle. Gillius is a recurring playable character in the Sega SuperStars series. *Death Adder is a tyrannical giant who wears a full iron helmet, pointed spaulders, and wields an enormous double axe. In addition to his brutal strength and speed while attacking, he can also cast magical spells. With his army, he enslaves the kingdom of Golden Axe and kidnaps its royal family. After dispatching his minions, Adder is finally killed by the game's three heroes, but is resurrected for Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder. Here, he survives an initial attempt on his life but perishes due to the self-sacrifice of Gilius Thunderhead. Death Adder reappears many years later in Golden Axe: The Duel, where he is a playable character, and the penultimate boss. In 2010, IGN ranked Death Adder 83rd in \\"Top 100 Videogames Villains\\". *In home console versions of Golden Axe, Death Adder is accompanied by his son, Death Adder Jr., and father, Death Bringer. These characters are palette swaps of the original Death Adder sprite, with similar powers and abilities. In the Genesis sequels, Golden Axe II and Golden Axe III, Death Adder's role is filled by Dark Guld and Damud Hellstrike, both of whom bear a strong resemblance to Death Adder. Other appearances The characters from the original Golden Axe have made cameo appearances in other Sega games. Ax Battler, Gilius Thunderhead and Tyris Flare all make a cameo appearance in the arcade version of Alien Storm. They can be found on one of the in-game television screens; a Golden Axe logo can also be seen during that cameo. Gilius Thunderhead makes another cameo appearance in the game, as part of a panel of judges rating the player's score. Gilius Thunderhead is also a playable character in Sega Superstars Tennis and Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. The latter also features a racetrack inspired by Golden Axe called \\"Adder's Lair\\". Ax Battler and Tyris Flare are available as playable characters in the Easy Mode of the Sega Ages 2500 version of Dynamite Deka. Death Adder also makes an appearance as one of the game's bosses. Chickenleg, the pink cockatrice with the tail lash from the first game, first appeared as an enemy in Altered Beast. In other media =Film and TV projects= In 2014, Sega formed the production company Stories International and teaming up with Evan Cholfin for film and TV projects based on their games with Golden Axe as an animated project with Universal Studios developing as a Movie or TV series. Gilius makes frequent appearances in the 2014 anime Hi☆sCoool!, alongside other SEGA characters. Of the cameo characrers, Gilius notably appears and is referenced more often than some of the others. =Comics= Golden Axe was featured in the British comic \\"Sonic the Comic\\", which was published by Fleetway. The series was titled \\"The Legend of the Golden Axe\\" and had two six-issue runs, written by Mark Eyles and illustrated by Mike White. Issues 1–6 feature the story \\"Citadel of Dead Souls\\", wherein a necromancer attempts to resurrect Dark Guld. Issues 13–18 have the story \\"Plague of Serpents\\", which involves a snake-charmer named Cobraxis kidnapping the Queen of Gilius' dwarf race. The story takes place in the aftermath of Golden Axe II. Characters from Golden Axe would later appear in the Worlds Unite crossover from Archie Comics alongside several other Sega and Capcom franchises.Schedeen, Jesse (February 26, 2015). \\"Capcom and Sega Join Forces for Worlds Unite Comic Book Crossover.\\" IGN.com.

The first such march on Washington, it drew between 75,000 and 125,000Ghaziani, Amin. 2008. The Dividends of Dissent: How Conflict and Culture Work in Lesbian and Gay Marches on Washington. The University of Chicago Press. gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, transgender people, and straight allies to demand equal civil rights and urge the passage of protective civil rights legislation. History and Planning The first major attempt at organizing a national gay and lesbian march on Washington occurred Thanksgiving Weekend 1973 in Urbana-Champaign, Illinois. The National Gay Mobilizing Committee for a March on Washington (NGMC), organized by Jeff Graubart, attempted to coordinate a coalition of extant LGBT organizations to plan a March on Washington. Early efforts were met with resistance from local and national LGBT organizations,Aiken Papers and plans for a march were ultimately postponed. The next organization attempt was to occur in Minneapolis the weekend of November 17–19, 1978. A steering committee was created to prepare for the Minneapolis conference, and it identified a primary goal of the march as transforming the gay movement from local to national. However, the committee was dissolved in October 1978 due to internal dissent.Gay Community News, November 25, 1978. \\"Committee Dissolves Itself: Planned March on Washington is in Trouble\\" by John Gracak Harvey Milk, who had been on the Minneapolis steering committee, took up the reins to continue march organization, and had secured support from local DC groups who had previously dissented before he was assassinated by Dan White. Milk's assassination served as a catalyst and a touchstone for organizers, who next planned a conference in Philadelphia February 23–25, 1979. One male and one female delegate was invited from known lesbian and gay organizations, and the attendees set forth to address three primary questions. First, whether or not a march should take place. Second, what the organizational structure of the march should be. And third, the platform of the march. An initial debate between marching in 1979 and 1980 sprung up, but 1979 was settled upon as it fell on the ten-year anniversary of the Stonewall Riots. Once these issues were settled and issues of female and minority representation were handled, the conference set forth five demands that would serve as the platform for the march. The participants chose to focus on single-issue politics so as not to dilute the message of a united lesbian and gay community. The final organizational push occurred at a conference at the University of Houston campus July 6–8, 1979. The National Steering Committee, with mandated gender parity and 25% representation of People of Color, was selected by community meetings throughout the country. Policy/Overview and Administrative Committees were established to guide the work and decisions between Steering Committee meetings. The National Office was set up in New York City with Joyce Hunter and Steven Ault as National Coordinators. Platform Joe Smenyak of New York City initially drafted Five Demands, later amended by the conference delegates. *Pass a comprehensive lesbian/gay rights bill in Congress *Issue a presidential executive order banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal government, the military, and federally contracted private employment *Repeal all anti-lesbian/gay laws *End discrimination in lesbian-mother and gay-father custody cases *Protect lesbian and gay youth from any laws which are used to discriminate, oppress, and/or harass them in their homes, schools, jobs, and social environmentshttp://www.cristanwilliams.com/b/wp- content/uploads/2012/12/MOWprogram-1979.pdf Program of march Activities and speakers The march served to nationalize the gay movement, which had previously been focused on local struggles. This spirit is invoked in the closing paragraph of the welcome program of the march, written by Allen Young. \\"Today in the capital of America, we are all here, the almost liberated and the slightly repressed; the butch, the femme and everything in-between; the androgynous; the monogamous and the promiscuous; the masturbators and the fellators and the tribadists; men in dresses and women in neckties; those who bite and those who cuddle; celebates[sic] and pederasts; diesel dykes and nelly queens; amazons and size queens, Yellow, Black, Brown, White, and Red; the shorthaired and the long, the fat and the thin; the nude and the prude; the beauties and the beasts; the studs and the duds; the communes, the couples, and the singles; pubescents and the octogenarians. Yes, we are all here! We are everywhere! Welcome to the March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights!\\" The march began at 4th Street and the National Mall, turned left onto Pennsylvania Avenue, proceeded northwest towards the White House, turned left onto 15th Street, right onto E Street, left onto 17th Street and ended in a rally between the Washington Monument and the Reflecting Pool. The march was led by the Salsa Soul Sisters, who carried the official march banner. It was also broadcast live on multiple National Public Radio affiliates throughout the US. Speakers and artists who spoke at the main rally included Harry Britt, Charlotte Bunch, Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky, Flo Kennedy, Morris Kight, Audre Lorde, Leonard Matlovich, Kate Millett, Troy Perry, Eleanor Smeal, First PFLAG President Adele Starr, and Congressman Ted Weiss. Mayor Marion Barry gave a welcome to the marchers on behalf of the city of Washington, DC. Jok Church and Adam Ciesielski recorded a documentary vinyl LP of the main speeches at the event. The recording includes the voices of Robin Tyler, Steve Ault, Tom Robinson, Lucia Valeska, Allen Ginsberg, Arlie Scott, Richard Ashworth, Florynce Kennedy, Charles Law, Mary Watkins & Company, Kate Millet, Reverend Troy Perry, and people on the Gay Freedom Train. Adam Ciesielski is credited for the photos. The record was released by Magnus Records of Sacramento, California in association with Alternate Publishing. Houston LGBT History (.org) holds an online recording of the record. In addition to the march itself, the organizers arranged three days of workshops featuring artistic events, strategy sessions, focus groups on specific issues of women and minorities within the LGBT community, consciousness raising, local organization, religion and other issues. The Monday after the march was organized as a \\"Constituent Lobbying Day\\" in which over 500 participants attempted to contact every member of Congress to express support for gay- rights legislation. The participants successfully met with fifty senators and more than 150 house members.Endean, Steve. \\"Bringing Lesbian and Gay Rights into the Mainstream: Twenty Years of Progress.\\" 2006.

Organizations supporting the march included Lambda Legal Defense Fund, the National Coalition of Black Lesbians and Gays, the National Gay Task Force (who had withheld their endorsement until only a month prior to the march), and the National Organization for Women.

The University of Chicago Press.

Accessed October 11, 2015 Background and planning The desire for a national march in the LGBT community was prompted by two major events in the 1980s: the AIDS pandemic, the Ronald Reagan administration's lack of acknowledgment of the AIDS crisis; and the Supreme Court of the United States ruling in Bowers v. Hardwick upholding the criminalization of sodomy between two consenting men in the privacy of a home. In 1986, Steve Ault & Joyce Hunter, co-coordinators of the 1979 National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, drafted documents to extant lesbian and gay organizations soliciting interest in a new march. The response was favorable, and the two organized an initial planning meeting in New York City on July 16, 1986, where it was decided that the march would be held in 1987. Representatives from all known lesbian and gay organizations were subsequently invited to a national conference in New York City on November 14–16, 1986 where they would discuss the politics, logistics and organization of the event. The delegates would be addressing four primary concerns: #What will a March on Washington accomplish?; #How should organizers and LGBT organizations proceed?; #What should be the focus and platform of the event?; and #When should the March take place? The conference was held under the slogan \\"For love and for life, we're not going back!\\"Byron, Peg. \\"Plans for National March Begin Amidst NY-DC Turf Battle.\\" Washington Blade. November 21, 1986 Throughout the planning weekend, delegates debated many aspects of the march itself, including the needs of more marginalized members of the community – lesbian and gay people of color, those living in poverty and with disabilities. The second meeting of the steering committee was held in January 1987 in the City of West Hollywood at City Hall. Steve Ault, Pat Norman and Kay Ostberg were elected as the three national co-chairs of the event. The final organizational meeting for the march took place in Atlanta on May 2–3, 1987. This meeting served primarily to hammer out logistical details and determine the slate of individuals to speak at the rally. Platform The delegates at the West Hollywood convention chose seven primary demands to serve as the platform for the 1987 March. Each of these demands was supplemented with a broader list of demands which extended beyond the scope of single-issue LGBT concerns. In doing so, the organizers wished to underscore their recognition that oppression of one group affects oppression of all groups. The seven primary demands were: *The legal recognition of lesbian and gay relationships. *The repeal of all laws that make sodomy between consenting adults a crime. *A presidential order banning discrimination by the federal government. *Passage of the Congressional lesbian and gay civil rights bill. *An end to discrimination against people with AIDS, ARC,AIDS-Related Complex, or AIDS-Related Conditions. HIV-positive status or those perceived to have AIDS. Massive increases in funding for AIDS education, research, and patient care. Money for AIDS, not for war. *Reproductive freedom, the right to control our own bodies, and an end to sexist oppression. *An end to racism in this country and apartheid in South Africa.Official Program of the 1987 National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights. Gerber/Hart Library Activities and speakers The march was part of six days of activities, with a mass wedding and protest in front of the Internal Revenue Service on October 10, and, three days later, a civil disobedience act in front of the Supreme Court building protesting its rulings upholding Bowers v. Hardwick. The march, demonstration and rally also included the first public display of Cleve Jones's NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt. The march itself was led by Cesar Chavez, Eleanor Smeal, Jesse Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg and several other celebrities, who were followed by people with AIDS and their supporters, a number of whom were in wheelchairs. Members of ACT UP brought their brand of theatrical and photogenic direct action to the march, and were featured prominently in the media of the event. Speakers at the rally included, among others: * former National Organization for Women president Eleanor Smeal * union president and Latino civil rights figure Cesar Chavez * actor and comedian Whoopi Goldberg * Jesse Jackson, then a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president. Jackson told the crowd, \\"Let's find a common ground of humanity... [W]e share the desire for life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, equal protection under the law. Let's not dwell on distinctions.\\" * Judy Tallwing McCarthey, the leather community’s keynote speaker at the march The 1987 march marked increased visibility for bisexuals. A bisexual contingent of about 75 marched, and then held the first nationwide bisexual gathering, which led to the eventual 1990 founding of the North American Bisexual Network (NABN). Lani Ka'ahumanu's article \\"The Bisexual Movement: Are We Visible Yet?\\", was also included in the Civil Disobedience Handbook for the Supreme Court action.http://www.lanikaahumanu.com/OUT%20OUTRAGED.pdf The 200,000 person estimate, widely quoted from The New York Times, was made several hours before the march actually began; similarly, most of the pictures the mainstream media used were taken early in the morning, or of the AIDS Quilt viewing area rather than of the much larger march itself. Police on the scene estimated numbers during the actual march to be closer to 750,000. The event was supported and endorsed from its early stages by such national LGBT organizations as the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. Legacy Energized by the sense of community, moved by the AIDS Quilt, and inspired by the activists from ACT UP New York, many participants returned home and started their own chapters of ACT UP or similar lesbian and gay rights organizations. A year later, in commemoration of the march, and to continue the momentum, the first National Coming Out Day was established.

Stars that show solar-like oscillations are called solar-like oscillators. The oscillations are standing pressure and mixed pressure-gravity modes that are excited over a range in frequency, with the amplitudes roughly following a bell-shaped distribution. Unlike opacity-driven oscillators, all the modes in the frequency range are excited, making the oscillations relatively easy to identify. The surface convection also damps the modes, and each is well-approximated in frequency space by a Lorentzian curve, the width of which corresponds to the lifetime of the mode: the faster it decays, the broader is the Lorentzian. All stars with surface convection zones are expected to show solar-like oscillations, including cool main-sequence stars (up to surface temperatures of about 7000K), subgiants and red giants. Because of the small amplitudes of the oscillations, their study has advanced tremendously thanks to space-based missions (mainly COROT and Kepler). Solar- like oscillations have been used, among other things, to precisely determine the masses and radii of planet-hosting stars and thus improve the measurements of the planets' masses and radii. In red giants, mixed modes are observed, which are in part directly sensitive to the core properties of the star. These have been used to distinguish red giants burning helium in their cores from those that are still only burning hydrogen in a shell, to show that the cores of red giants are rotating more slowly than models predict and to constrain the internal magnetic fields of the cores  Echelle diagrams  An echelle diagram for the Sun, using data for low-angular-degree modes from the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON). Modes of the same angular degree \\\\ell form roughly vertical lines at high frequencies, as expected from the asymptotic behaviour of the mode frequencies. The peak of the oscillation power roughly corresponds to lower frequencies and radial orders for larger stars. For the Sun, the highest amplitude modes occur around a frequency of 3 mHz with order n_\\\\mathrm{max}\\\\approx20, and no mixed modes are observed. For more massive and more evolved stars, the modes are of lower radial order and overall lower frequencies. Mixed modes can be seen in the evolved stars. In principle, such mixed modes may also be present in main-sequence stars but they are at too low frequency to be excited to observable amplitudes. High- order pressure modes of a given angular degree \\\\ell are expected to be roughly evenly-spaced in frequency, with a characteristic spacing known as the large separation \\\\Delta u. This motivates the echelle diagram, in which the mode frequencies are plotted as a function of the frequency modulo the large separation, and modes of a particular angular degree form roughly vertical ridges.  Scaling relations  The frequency of maximum oscillation power is accepted to vary roughly with the acoustic cut-off frequency, above which waves can propagate in the stellar atmosphere, and thus are not trapped and do not contribute to standing modes. This gives : u_\\\\mathrm{max}\\\\propto\\\\frac{g}{\\\\sqrt{T_\\\\mathrm{eff}}} Similarly, the large frequency separation \\\\Delta u is known to be roughly proportional to the square root of the density: :\\\\Delta u\\\\propto\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{M}{R^3}} When combined with an estimate of the effective temperature, this allows one to solve directly for the mass and radius of the star, basing the constants of proportionality on the known values for the Sun. These are known as the scaling relations: :M\\\\propto\\\\frac{ u_\\\\mathrm{max}^3}{\\\\Delta u^4}T_\\\\mathrm{eff}^{3/2} :R\\\\propto\\\\frac{ u_\\\\mathrm{max}}{\\\\Delta u^2}T_\\\\mathrm{eff}^{1/2} Equivalently, if one knows the star's luminosity, then the temperature can be replaced via the blackbody luminosity relationship L\\\\propto R^2T_\\\\mathrm{eff}^4, which gives :M\\\\propto\\\\frac{ u_\\\\mathrm{max}^{12/5}}{\\\\Delta u^{14/5}}L^{3/10} :R\\\\propto\\\\frac{ u_\\\\mathrm{max}^{4/5}}{\\\\Delta u^{8/5}}L^{1/10} See also * Asteroseismology * Helioseismology * Variable stars = Some bright solar-like oscillators = * Procyon * Alpha Centauri A and B * Mu Herculis  References  External links * Lecture Notes on Stellar Oscillations published by J.

Los Alamos. A native of Portland, Oregon, who grew up in Iowa City, Cornog earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Iowa. After working for the United States Bureau of Reclamation on the Boulder Dam design, he studied at UC Berkeley for his doctorate in physics. His graduate student research led to the co-discovery, with Luis Alvarez, of hydrogen and helium of atomic mass 3 (tritium and helium-3). He also assisted Emilio Segrè in the discovery of element 85, astatine. During World War II, Cornog designed magnetic equipment for ships and went to work on the Manhattan Project, successively at UC Berkeley, Princeton University and in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Cornog became chief engineer of the ordnance division of the atomic bomb development team and was involved in the development of the bomb's trigger mechanism. In the 1950s, he focused on aerodynamics, nuclear energy and rocket engineering, working on missile systems for several Southern California companies, including Northrop, Space Technology Laboratories and Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation, which became TRW. Also an expert on vacuum technology, Cornog headed Vacuum Enterprises from 1967 to 1974 and managed product development for Torr Vacuum Products until 1984. He held several patents and served as a technical advisor on the film Fat Man and Little Boy, about the atomic bomb. Envisioning peaceful uses for nuclear and space technology, Cornog in 1959 foresaw a world in 40 to 50 years with worldwide color television broadcasts, satellites assembled in space and accurate weather prediction.

The episode was written by co-executive producer Jennifer Celotta and directed by Roger Nygard, making it Nygard's only series credit. It first aired on NBC in the United States on October 12, 2006. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is overcome with grief when he learns about the death of his former boss Ed Truck. Michael spends the rest of the day attempting grief counseling for the mostly grief-lacking office. Meanwhile, in Stamford Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) embark on a quest for a particular brand of potato chips. The outdoor scenes were filmed during the summer, although the cast had to pretend like it was in the middle of winter; this included wearing coats. \\"Grief Counseling\\" earned a Nielsen rating of 4.1 with an 11 percent share in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic and was watched by 8.83 million viewers. The episode was viewed favorably by most television critics; Pam's pranks and the bird funeral were a particular source of praise, as was Michael's monologue on the five stages of grief. Synopsis Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is informed by Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) that his former boss Ed Truck has died. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) and Phyllis Lapin (Phyllis Smith) console Michael after he breaks the news to a mostly unmoved staff. Later, Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) tells Michael that Truck, heavily inebriated, was decapitated in a truck accident while speeding drunk on U.S. Route 6. Michael summons the staff to a primitive grief counseling session involving a collapsible Hoberman sphere ball, in which Michael tells members of the staff to give stories of deceased love ones. This leads to the staff telling stories about losing loved ones based on death scenes in movies (Million Dollar Baby, The Lion King, and Weekend at Bernie's) with Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) saying he would elaborate more on his story, but it would take about an hour and a half to do it. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) tells Michael death is a part of life, and uses an example of a bird that flew into a first-floor window that morning. Michael charges outside, picks up the deceased animal and tries in vain to revive it. Michael schedules a parking lot funeral for the bird. Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) fashions a makeshift coffin and reads a prepared speech that comforts Michael. Pam then proceeds to sing \\"On the Wings of Love\\" as Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) accompanies her on his recorder. The coffin is placed in a box of shredded paper and set afire. Meanwhile, in Stamford, Connecticut, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) gains authority over Karen Filippelli's (Rashida Jones) schedule for the day. When Karen mentions her favorite kind of Herr's potato chips is missing from the vending machine, Jim tells Karen that they cannot work until they find her chips. The duo spends the rest of the day searching stores and vending machines around town in a vain attempt to find the chips. But at the end of the day, Karen finds a bag of Herr's on her desk. Jim tells the documentary crew that he traced the chips from the manufacturer to the distributor to the vending machine company to an adjacent office building. Production Roger Nygard directed the episode, his only credit for the series. \\"Grief Counseling\\" was written by co-executive producer Jennifer Celotta, and was directed by Roger Nygard, his only episode of The Office to date. In a later interview with Den of Geek, Nygard found that \\"television episodes are the domain of the writer-producers. You are there to service their vision. The Office is fully scripted, but there's always a little room to play when it's warranted. The first cuts are around 45 minutes, so you often have to cut the episodes in half for air.\\" Though \\"Grief Counseling\\" broadcast before the fifth episode, \\"Initiation\\", its filming took place after that episode due to the availability of shooting on Dwight's fictional beet farm. The episode's plot involved the death of former boss Ed Truck, a character who had been played by Ken Howard in the second-season episode \\"The Carpet\\". As part of the episode took place outdoors, the cast had to wear coats despite the hot summer weather. Actress Kate Flannery commented in a weekly blog she wrote for TV Guide that \\"we suffered while shooting the outdoor scenes... We had to act like it was cold when it was warm. For hours and hours. You would never know it by looking at us. Isn't that crazy?\\" Flannery also wrote, \\"I love this episode because it's dark, for a comedy. This time The Office tackles gutsy subject matter.\\" In her memoir Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, Mindy Kaling wrote that the episode resulted in the worst disagreement she ever had during her years on the show, where she and Greg Daniels, normally a \\"very nice\\" person, disagreed on a story point to the extent that Daniels told her that if \\"you [were] going to resist what I'm doing here, you can just go home.\\" Kaling briefly left the set before returning, with no further problems or repercussions noted. Deleted scenes of the episode were released in the third season DVD. Such scenes included a coworker showing Jim photographs of her baby, Dwight telling everyone to delete their records of Ed Truck, Michael talking about a need for a grief counselor, Toby holding a grief counseling session for the office, and Roy telling Pam of the birth of a cousin's twins. Reception \\"Grief Counseling\\" first aired on October 12, 2006 on NBC in the United States. It received a Nielsen rating of 4.1/11. This means that it was seen by 4.1% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode was viewed by 8.83 million viewers and placed as the 24th most-watched episode for the week in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. IGN columnist Brian Zoromski rated \\"Grief Counseling\\" 9.5/10, an indication of an \\"amazing\\" episode. Writing that the opening sequence \\"excellently set\\" the tone of the episode, he found a \\"ton of great moments\\", such as Michael's \\"totally awkward speeches on Ed Truck's death\\" and his conversation with Dwight over a robot statue. Zoromski saved the most praise for Pam and her pranks, particularly her \\"completely ridiculous bird funeral... It was all so brilliantly over-the-top it becomes clear that the Scranton office will continue to be enjoyable to watch, as Pam takes over the mocking of the office all on her own, to a hilarious extreme.\\" AOL TV's Michael Sciannamea also lauded Pam and her pranks, especially highlighting her actions during the opening sequence and her song during the bird funeral. Sciannamea assumed that \\"she feels liberated from Roy (and Jim, to some extent) [and] is allowing her personality and sense of humor to come out even more.\\" He concluded that it was \\"another solid episode with Steve Carell at his best.\\" Entertainment Weeklys Abby West expressed praise for an episode that \\"restored balance and order to our favorite paper-pushers while still nicely forwarding the storylines of TV's plainest super-non-couple.\\" West was also pleased \\"to have Michael back to his usual insanity\\", and wrote that Pam \\"was priceless tonight, from the spot-on reaction shots to the movie- plotlines-as-my-pain gag she started to the almost-believably tender eulogy she delivered for the singing, er, impressionist bird, complete with the most tricked-out pencil-case coffin you've ever seen.\\" Television Without Pity graded the episode with a B–. Michael's monologue about the five stages of grief has also been isolated for praise; Michael Sciannamea called it \\"the best line of the night,\\" and in 2011, IGN's Cindy White selected it as one of the series' best.

It no longer exists.

It was completed in 1903 on grounds of . The building was loosely patterned upon a French chateau but fanciful in style, with 99 rooms in a compact, three-story structure ornamented with prominent turrets. Contrary to popular rumors that Mrs. Schell despised the Chateau and refused to live in it, the Schells summered at their beautiful home for 25 years. It was only after the death of her beloved husband in 1928 that Mrs. Schell refused to set foot in the house again, insisting when she stayed at the Northfield Hotel during future summers that she have a room not overlooking the grand house that had been her husband's pride and joy. A server at the Inn overheard her once responding to another guest's compliments of her former home with \\"I hate it; I never go there.\\" After Mr. Schell's death, the mansion fell into disrepair and was eventually sold to the Northfield School for Girls which also owned the Northfield Hotel. They intended to use it as a meeting place and novelty hotel annex; however, it was never practical for hotel use and in the end was demolished in 1963. Until that time, it was used by the Northfield School for Girls as the location of their prom. That is why the prom at Northfield Mount Hermon School to this day is called The Chat. For a brief time, the basement of the chateau was also used as a youth hostel--one of America's first, begun by Monroe and Isabel Smith. The Tinney Family of Belcourt Castle rescued many pieces from the chateau before its destruction, notably the mirrors which now are in their banquet hall.

Revenues from China make up around 25% of nearly video game industry as of 2018, and since 2015 has exceeded the contribution to the global market from the United States. Because of its market size, China has been described as the \\"Games Industry Capital of the World\\" and is home to some of the largest video game companies. China has also been a major factor in the growth of esports, both in player talent and in revenue. China had not always been a major factor in the industry, having been on the verge of economic recovery during the industry's formulative years in the 1970s and 1980s. With the introduction of the second generation of home consoles in the mid-1980s, a new black market of illegally-imported goods and video game clones arose to avoid the high costs of imports, driving away foreign companies. Notably, China imposed a near-complete ban on video game consoles in 2000, fearing the addicting-like impact of games on its youth; the ban was ultimately lifted in 2015. During that time, China's video game market greatly expanded in the area of computer games, including massively multiplayer online games (MMOs), social games, and mobile games, all which could be free to play titles with monetization to appeal to the average lower income of Chinese players. This massive growth from 2007 to 2013 led the games' publishers and operating companies like Tencent and Netease to become large global companies. Despite the legitimate growth of the industry, China's video game market continues to be offset by illegal importing and intellectual copyright theft. As with other parts of its media, China's government has strong oversight of the video game industry. All games released there must go through a government approval process to affirm content is appropriate for the values of the nation; a 2018 approvals freeze, a result from the government reorganizing the agencies responsible for this process, caused numerous game releases to be held up, reflected in economic factors over the next year. Additionally, the government fears the potential for its youth to become addicted to video games, and have required games to include anti-addiction measures to limit playtime. History Broadly, the growth of the video game market in China is tied to expansion of its technology and digital economy from the 1990s to present day, which by 2016 represented over 30% of its gross domestic product. =Initial growth (1980s-2000) = An internet café in Tongyang Town, the county seat of Tongshan County, Hubei. At the time that the video game industry was being established in North America in the 1970s, China was in the midst of major political and economic reform following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976. The country was technologically behind much of the rest of the world in terms of its media. Part of the reform was modernization of its media systems, helping to boost economic prosperity for citizens. As such, China saw little of arcade games or the first generation of home consoles, like the Atari 2600. After the video game crash of 1983 which devastated the North American video game market, Japan became a dominant factor in the global market leading off the second generation of consoles such as Nintendo's Famicom. By this point, China's economy had significantly improved, and Japan started to make inroads into selling consoles into China. However, importing these into China was costly, with a 130% tariff on hardware and games along with value-added taxes. Console systems were in high demand, but because of the high costs of importing, only few foreign companies did so. This created the video game clone grey market in China – reverse manufacturing of consoles and games at much lower costs than imported system, even if this required dubious or illegal copyright infringement. Outright copyright theft (\\"piracy\\") was also rampant in China due to the country's poor intellectual property controls. The sales of cloned console hardware and games outpaced that of legitimate imports, and further drove many foreign companies away since they could not compete with this area, such that by the 1990s, most video game systems in China were manufactured there. Console games continued to grow in popularity through the 1990s, which created a broader concern in the media of video game addiction, with terms like \\"digital heroin\\" being used to describe video games. Even before the 1990s, there had been a broader stance in China that video games created negative effects on those that played them, which only grew during this decade. The impact on youth was particularly of concern, as video games were known to detract students from schoolwork, leaving them unprepared to enter China's college system. This situation was partially created by China's one-child policy, with sibling-less children having few others to interact with and little to do outside of school. The anti-addiction facet also discouraged foreign companies from trying to break into the Chinese market. =Chinese console ban (2000–2015)= The concerns about video game addiction and negative influence on the youth came to a head in June 2000. The State Council passed a bill crafted by seven ministries specifically aimed at video games. The bill established certain provisions on video game content and regulations on operations of Internet cafés and arcades. The most significant facet of this bill was a ban on the production, import, and sale of consoles and arcade machines. This ban was not absolute, as it allowed for some consoles to be released in China, notably Sony's PlayStation 2 in 2004 and several of Nintendo's consoles rebranded under the iQue partnership. However, with the restriction on game imports and their content, these consoles did not catch on in China. The ban did not include games available on personal computers (PC), and as a result, the PC video game market in China flourished over the next fifteen years. Internet cafés flourished, growing from 40,000 in 2000 to over 110,000 by 2002, and have remained numerous since. The ban on arcade machines was dropped in 2009, but while arcade were permitted to operate, they had to take several safeguards to prevent excessive use by youth. However, since such arcades offered a low-cost way to play games without a PC, they still became a thriving industry comparable to PC gaming at internet cafes. As a result, Chinese gamers frequently visit the arcades to play action games, particularly fighting games, and occasionally unlicensed arcade ports of popular PC or mobile games such as Angry Birds or Plants vs. Zombies. = Online gaming (2004–2007) = 2006 ChinaJoy Legitimate acquisition of games and the hardware to play them was still relatively expensive in China, which continued to fuel the video game clone market in China. A large number of PC gamers in China acquired software through illegal downloads and pirated software websites to avoid the cost. Developers of legitimate games in China recognized that, to compete with this black market, they had to develop games that had a free or low upfront cost model but offered a way to monetize their games over time. Many Chinese-developed games became online games offering numerous microtransactions to recoup costs; such games could be offered at Internet cafés, which became a popular option for Chinese players that could not afford computer hardware, even as the price of computing equipment dropped over the next decade. This created a boon of massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) in the Chinese market and which helped to establish market dominance of companies like Tencent, Perfect World, and NetEase. PC cafes proliferated in urban centers as China's population continued to grow. Western free-to-play and subscription-based games like League of Legends and World of Warcraft, poised to take advantage of this model, also became successful. It also prompted Chinese developers to develop numerous clones of popular Western games that they would offer at low cost, an issue that still persist presently. Online gaming became of serious concern to the government around 2007, re-raising the issues of gaming addiction that had prompted the 2000 console ban. A government report claimed that 6% of the country's teenaged population, about 3.5% of the country's population, were playing online games more than 40 hours a week. In July 2007, the government required that online game publishers and operates incorporate anti-addiction software on their games, specifically by monitoring how long underaged persons played. If a minor played for more than three hours straight, the game was to wipe half of any in-game currency that had earned that session, and lose all credits if played for more than five hours. Additionally, these systems were required to have the player to log in using their national identification. However, at the time of implementation, not all publishers incorporated the required controls, and for those that did, players would find ways around the limitations, such as using family member IDs, or otherwise would simply play past the time requirements as there was nothing else to do beyond the video game. =Social and mobile gaming (2008–2014)= By 2007, the size of the Chinese video game market was estimated to be about with around 42 million players, having grown 60% from the previous year mostly driven by online gaming. At this stage, China's impact on the larger global market, valued at , was not considered significant, as much of it was still driven by the grey market for clones and pirated games. However, the rapid growth led to forecasts that China would be a major contributor to the global market within five-years time. Online gaming readily led way to the rise of social network games in China around 2007–2008, given that players were accustomed to free- to-play nature of online gaming. The Chinese game Happy Farm (2008) was included in Wired list of \\"The 15 Most Influential Games of the Decade\\" at #14, for its major influence on global social network games, particularly for having \\"inspired a dozen Facebook clones,\\" the largest being Zynga's FarmVille. A number of other games have since used similar game mechanics, such as Sunshine Farm, Happy Farmer, Happy Fishpond, Happy Pig Farm, Farm Town, Country Story, Barn Buddy, Sunshine Ranch, and Happy Harvest, as well as parodies such as Jungle Extreme and Farm Villain. (Translation) This further prepared the China market for mobile games around 2012, where there are about one billion mobile phone subscriptions in China owned a mobile phone according to a United Nations report, and after Apple secured deals to distribute their iPhones within China. Mobile devices in China are less expensive than computer or console hardware, as well as provide Internet functionality, and for many, the only form of Internet connectivity they have, making them popular gaming devices. Mobile games in China grew rapidly over the next several years, growing from about 10% of the Chinese video game market in 2012 to 41% in 2016. This expanded to more than 50% by 2018. Furthering the growth of the social and mobile game markets was the fact that the anti-addiction measures applied to online games did not apply to these types of titles; it was not until 2017 where renewed concerns about mobile titles like Honour of Kings led Tencent to implement a similar anti-addiction system for its portfolio. Social and mobile gaming significantly grew the Chinese video game market beyond earlier estimates. By 2013, the Chinese market for video games saw nearly a ten-fold growth since 2007, valued at of the global , with over 490 million players, counting only those on personal computers; since consoles were still banned, these numbers do not take console players into account. =Lifting of the console ban (2014–2017)= In 2014, China partially eased the restrictions on video game hardware by allowing game consoles to be manufactured in the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone (FTZ) and sold in the rest of China subject to cultural inspections. In July 2015, the ban on video game consoles within the country was completely lifted. According to a statement from the country's Ministry of Culture, companies like Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft — among others — were now allowed to manufacture and sell video game consoles anywhere in the country. Microsoft and Sony quickly took advantage of the lifting of the ban, announcing sales of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 platforms within the FTZ shortly after the 2014 announcement. Microsoft established a partnership with BesTV New Media Co, a subsidiary of the Shanghai Media Group, to sell Xbox One units in China, with units first shipping by September 2014. Sony worked with Shanghai Oriental Pearl Media in May 2014 to establish manufacturing in the FTZ, with the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita shipping into China by March 2015. CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment Andrew House explained in September 2013 that the company intended to use the PlayStation Vita TV as a low-cost alternative for consumers in an attempt to penetrate the Chinese video game market.2013-09-12, Sony not planning to release PlayStation Vita TV in the US or Europe 'at this point', Videogamer Both Microsoft and Sony have identified China as a key market for their next-generation of consoles, expected to be unveiled in 2020. Nintendo did not initially seek to bring the Wii U into China; Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime stated that China was of interest to the company after the ban was lifted, but considered that there were similar difficulties with establishing sales there as they had recently had with Brazil. Later, Nintendo had teamed up with Tencent by April 2019 to help sell and distribute the Nintendo Switch as well as aid its games through the Chinese government approval process led by National Radio and Television Administration. The Nintendo Switch went on sale in China on December 10, 2019. Even with the ban lifted, console sales were slow, as consoles requires dedicated space in home and did not have additional functionality, like personal computers, and further slowed by continued popularity of Internet cafès. The hardware grey market also persisted, drawing away legitimate sales of consoles. Of the industry revenue in 2018, only about was attributed to console sales. It is expected that as more interest in legitimate sales of consoles increases in the future, the grey market will wane. = Approvals freeze (2018-onward) = In March 2018, the organization structural of SART was changed, created a period of several months where no new game licenses were given out. Further, MOC had made the process of getting these licenses more stringent. This period has significantly impacted Tencent, one of the largest publishers of video games for China. In August 2018, Tencent was forced to pull from sale their version of Monster Hunter World from China as they had not gotten their license for it and the government received complaints about its content. Tencent were also blocked on publishing personal computer versions of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and Fortnite Battle Royale. The license freezes was reported to have significant effects on those game publishers and developers that rely on Chinese sales. In late August 2018, the Chinese Ministry of Education called on the Chinese government and SART to also address the growing issue of myopia in children which was attributed to long hours of gaming on small screens like with mobile devices. the Ministry of Education had asked SART to consider placing restrictions on the number of hours each young player can play a game. On news of this, Tencent shares lost 5% of their value, an estimated on the stock market the next day. A further approval route was closed by Chinese authorities in October 2018; this \\"green channel\\" route that had been in place by August 2018, which allowed a game to have a period of one month on the market for purposes of consumer testing without having full government approval, but which had been seen by game publishers as temporary relief from the current ban. Tencent had been planning on distributing and monetizing from Fortnite Battle Royale via this method before this route was closed. With China's effective ban of new games continuing into October 2018, Chinese players have found other routes of getting new games, which include using Steam which uses overseas servers. Further, existing titles released before the freeze that continue to offer new content have seen a resurgence in players and spending as a result. To comply with the planned new rules, Tencent announced that all mobile games it manages in China will require users to use their Chinese ID to play. This will be used by Tencent to track the time that minors play the game and implement time limitations on them, among other steps to meet new regulations. By December 2018, the Chinese government had formed the \\"Online Game Ethics Committee\\" falling under the National Radio and Television Administration, which will review all games to be published in China for appropriate content as well as issues related to childhood myopia. The committee, by the end of the year, had restarted the approval process and will be working through a backlog of submissions to review in an expedited manner to allow new games to be released. Initial approvals to 80 back-logged titles was granted within days, but notably lacked games published by Tencent and Netease, the two largest publishers in China. After several more rounds, Tencent had two games approved near the end of January 2019, but did not include either Fortnite Battle Royale or PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, two major titles that were financial drivers in other countries. A second freeze on approvals started in February 2019, as any further approvals on new games were suspending until the committee has been able to clear the backlog of the titles from the prior freeze. By this point, only about 350 games had been approved from the previous freeze. According to China's State Administration of Press and Publication, the freezes were put in place as the video game industry had grown too rapidly in China at a rate that passed the capabilities for regulation to keep up. The second freeze that started in February 2019 was to put in place to give regulators a change to tune the game approval process to meet the current market size. The freeze is expected to be lifted in April 2019, alongside a new set of regulations for game approvals. These new changes include limiting the number of games that can be approved each year to around 5,000 games, strictly banning video game clones and games with obscene content, and placing more anti-addiction controls on mobile titles aimed at younger players. The nearly year-long freeze has had rippling effects on the global video game industry. Whereas in 2017, around 9,600 new games were approved, only around 1,980 were approved within 2018. Tencent had been one of the top 10 companies in the world at the start of 2018, but by October, its stock had dropped in value by 40%, an estimated , and knocked the company out of the top ten. Apple Inc. attributed revenue loss in the fourth quarter of 2018 to China's approval freeze, which had also affected mobile video game apps. The freeze is expected to impact total revenues of the video game industry in 2019, with one analysis projecting a decline in revenue from the previous year, the first time in only a decade. The video game industry in China =Publishers= Today, the video game market is dominated by the Tencent Games division of Tencent Holdings, which is estimated to contribute to 46% of the overall revenue in China, and nearly 10% of the global video game market as of 2017, making it the largest video game company in the world. Other major players include NetEase, Perfect World, Shunrong, and Shanda. These companies are noted for having made aggressive investments in foreign video game developers, particularly from South Korea and the United States, and for making strategic agreements with other entities to serve as the China- based operating arm for foreign interests to meet Chinese government regulations. Notably, Tencent's acquisitions have included: to acquire Riot Games in 2011 to gain right to the online game League of Legends and for Supercell in 2016 for its mobile game Clash of Clans. Among major investiments include approximately 5% of Activision in 2013, a 40% interest in Epic Games in 2013, and a 5% interest in Ubisoft in 2018. =Developers= China has domestically produced a number of games, including Arena of Valor, Westward Journey, The Incorruptible Warrior, and Crazy Mouse. There are a large number of domestically made massively multiplayer online role-playing game MMORPGs in China, although many generally remain unheard of outside of the country. China does have a small but growing indie game scene. The growth of China's indie game scene is considered to have been through hobbyist programmers starting around the 1990s and into the 2000s after the console ban where personal computer games became more popular. An early well-known indie developer, Coconut Island, was founded in the mid-2000s, and through its success, starting a number of game jams around the country starting in 2011, and eventually established the China Indie Game Alliance, one of the country's largest developer communities. Further interest in indie game development came with the popularity of mobile games in the country. The 2014 title Monument Valley developed by Ustwo in the United Kingdom is considered to have been an influential title as it was able to tell an emotional story through the game medium, and drew more interest in the indie game scene. Indie game development is challenged by the governmental approval process, requiring resources that many indie developers do not have. As with mainstream commercial games, indie games must be approved and get a license to be sold, or otherwise may be offered freely, which does not require a license. This has led to a black market around obtaining licenses, using non-China-controlled platforms like Steam to distribute games, or other questionable means to get their game into players' hands. As Valve has been working with Perfect World to create a China-specific client for Steam, which would be limited to games approached by the Chinese government, several indie developers fear this may harm the indie scene within China. =Manufacturers= Most of the major video game systems in the world since the 1990s have been manufactured in China; by 2019, 96% of all video game consoles were manufactured in China, generally taking advantage of the net lower-income labor available in the country. Some of the larger manufacturers based in China or with factories within China creating video game consoles include Foxconn, Hosiden, and Flex. Because of this, trade relations between China and other countries can have an impact on video game console pricing. Around 2019, as Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo were preparing their next generation systems, a trade war between the United States and China was threatening to create a 25% import tariff on electronic goods shipped into the U.S. from China, which would have significantly affected the prices of these new consoles. There had already been an impact on personal computer components prior, leading to speculation on the impact on consoles. Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo jointly petitioned the U.S. government to not go through with this plan, in addition to other electronics vendors in the U.S. By January 2020, the U.S. government affirmed it had backed off this planned tariff. Despite this, Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo have all expressed plans to divest some of the Chinese manufacturing to other countries in southest Asia such as Vietnam. Esports Esports in China had been significant since 1996, as the country gained access to the Internet and PC gaming cafes began appearing across the county, also added by the popularity of QQ, a Chinese instant messaging client that helped with long-distance communications. Players quickly flocked to existing Western games that supported competitive Internet play such as Command & Conquer: Red Alert and Quake II. However, it was the release of StarCraft in 1998 that established the formation of organized competitive esports in China, including the formation of the China StarCraft Association to arrange unofficial tournaments for 1999 and onward. That same year was also the first official esports tournament in China based on Quake II. By 2000, the China E-Sports Association, formed from StarCraft players, was established, and Chinese players and teams participated and won medals starting with the World Cyber Games 2001. By 2003, the Chinese government recognized the success that Chinese players had in these games, and despite the stigma that the government had towards the addicting qualities of video games, recognized esports as an official sport in 2003, encouraging youth to excel in this area and that participating in esports was \\"training the body for China\\". China continued to expand its esports engagement alongside South Korea over the next several years, with its growth occurring alongside the growth of other online games in China. China became more involved with planning of the World Cyber Games along South Korea, who had founded the event in 2000. The growth was further fueled by China's large Internet companies investing in esports teams and players, establishing esport tournaments of their own, and acquiring Korea developers of popular esports games. These companies have also gained investment into foreign companies that have produced popular esports titles in China. Notably, Tencent initially acquired an investment into Riot Games in 2008, which produced League of Legends, and by 2015 had fully acquired the studio. Tencent has also invested into Activision Blizzard, which, through Blizzard Entertainment, distribute StarCraft, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, and Heroes of the Storm. The Alibaba Group and other e-commerce Chinese businesses have also invested heavily into the esports arena within China as early as 2006, but have made more inroads by establishing the World Electronic Sports Games in 2016 as a replacement for the World Cyber Games. Alibaba's efforts have centered on making the cities of Hangzhou and Changzhou esports centers in China. Due to both government encouragement and industry investment, the number of professional esports players in China grew from 50 in 2006 to over 1000 in 2016. In early 2019, China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security included both \\"professional gamer\\" and \\"professional gaming operator\\" as an officially recognized job on its Occupation Skill Testing Authority list; by July 2019, around 100,000 people had registers themselves as \\"professional gamers\\" under this, and were making an average of three times the average salary in China. The Ministry had stated they believe that the professional esports sector in China can have over 2 million jobs in five years. This expansive growth has led several local governments to offer incentives for bringing esports to their cities. In esports, China has been the world leader in terms of tournament winnings, possessing some of the best talents in the world across multiple video games, as well as one of the largest pool of video gamers. As of 2017, half of the top 20 highest earning esports players in the world are Chinese. In addition to talent, China is also one of the largest consumers of esports. The 2017 League of Legends World Championship, held in Beijing, drew an estimated 106 million viewers from online streaming services with 98% of them from China, a number on par with the television audience of the Super Bowl. The event was seen as China establishing its place in the global esports marketplace, and demonstrated how China and South Korea's leadership in this area has helped to expand esports popularity to other countries. China is estimated to have about 20% of the global revenue in esports, including sponsorships, merchandising and media rights, with an estimated of the global by 2019, having surpassed Europe and trailing only behind North America. Intellectual property protection As described above, China has had a history of a gray market of illegal imports and video game clones, both in hardware and software, as well as copyright theft/piracy as a result of poor intellectual property laws and enforcement in the latter part of the 20th century. Chinese developers have been known to copy video games from foreign developers which resulted in multiple clones of established video game franchises. Some developers take inspiration from existing games and incorporate the designs, gameplay and mechanics to their own IPs. There have been multiple lawsuits filed by major video game companies such as the case filed by Riot Games against Moonton Technology for copying its characters featured in League of Legends. There have been reports where plagiarists are credited as the original creators. Analysts have attributed the rise in plagiarism to lack of knowledge of the original IPs due to non-releases of games in the Chinese Markets, delays or outright ban by the Chinese government.https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/23/ip-plagiarism-is-rampant-in-china- and-media-companies-profit-from-it.html More recently, with the tech industry boom in China, the government has implemented more stricter copyright controls and processes, but it is still considered to be behind intellectual copyright protections in Western nations and poses a threat for foreign companies seeking to sell into China. Government oversight =Responsible agencies= Video games are regulated through the government as with most mass media in China, but further, as video games are seen as a cultural benefit, additional agencies are involved in promoting the growth of video games. Major bodies involved in the oversight of video games include: * The Ministry of Information Industry (MII) of the People's Republic of China: MII was formed in the late 1990s through the integration of the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and the Ministry of Electronics Industry. The agency's primary goals include the regulation and promotion of Chinese telecommunications and software companies which include online gaming. MII is also responsible for a number of initiatives aimed at increasing the number and prominence of natively produced online games. One example of such involvement is the inclusion of online gaming in the 2006–2010 plan for software and information service development.People's Daily Online. \\"China's Online Game Industry on a Roll\\". 2007. * The General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP) is responsible for monitoring and regulating publication of print based media, electronic media, and audio-visual products (including online games).chinaculture.org. \\"General Administration of Press and Publishing of PRC\\". GAPP has also been instrumental in combating the growing problem of Internet addiction and game addiction in China by teaming up with eight other government outlets concerned with the growing effect of game play on China's youth. Towards this end, GAPP works with other agencies, including the Central Civilization Office, Ministry of Education, Chinese Communist Youth League, Ministry of Information Industry, Ministry of Public Security, All China Women's Federation, and China's Care for the Next Generation Work Commission. GAPP also initiated the China National Online Game Publication Project in 2004. The intent of the project was to promote native game development through the use of government subsidies to game developers. In its third year, the project is to run through at least 2008, and has provided an estimated 300 million RMB to 16 Chinese game development companies.TDC Trade.\\"Business Alert - China\\". January 2005. * The State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT) affected the world of Chinese online games in 2004 by instating a blanket ban on computer game related commercials in the state-run media. The only company to directly contradict this ban is Chinese game provider The9, which teamed with Coca-Cola to jointly promote the release of the popular Western MMORPG World of Warcraft in 2005. Besides this instance, the online game market has thrived without much media promotion. =Content control and censorship= As with almost all mass media in the country, video games in China are subject to the national policies of censorship. Content in video games is overseen by SART/NRTA; publishers are required to obtain a license for the game in China from SART before publishing, which may be denied if the game contains elements deemed inappropriate. The process to submit games for a license and put them on sale following that is overseen by MOC. The State General Administration of Press and Publication and anti-porn and illegal publication offices have also played a role in screening games. Examples of banned games have included: *Hearts of Iron (for \\"distorting history and damaging China's sovereignty and territorial integrity\\") *I.G.I.-2: Covert Strike (for \\"intentionally blackening China and the Chinese army's image\\") *Command & Conquer: Generals - Zero Hour (for \\"smearing the image of China and the Chinese army\\") *Battlefield 4 (for \\"smearing the image of China and endangering national security\\") In addition to banning games completely, several games have had their content screened to remove certain imagery deemed offensive or unfavorable. Common examples include skeletons or skulls being either fleshed out or removed entirely. Cases of which can be seen in Chinese versions of popular video games such as Dota 2 and World of Warcraft. With the formation of the Online Game Ethics Committee in December 2018, nine titles reportedly were classified as prohibited or to be withdrawn, but this has yet to be confirmed by reliable sources. These included Fortnite, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, H1Z1, Paladins, and Ring of Elysium. Eleven other titles were told that they needed to make corrective action to be sold within China, including Overwatch, World of Warcraft, Diablo 3, and League of Legends. Publishing a title without having government approval can lead to a company being fined from five to ten times the revenues they earned from the game. In addition to content control, the Chinese government has pushed technology companies, including video game distributors like Tencent, into allowing the government to have partial ownership of the companies that can be used to affect the content produced; in exchange, such companies may gain a competitive edge over others in interactions dealing with the government. =Anti-addiction measures= China was one of the first countries to recognize the potential for addiction to the Internet, video games, and other digital media, and was the first country to formally classify Internet addiction a clinical disorder by recognizing Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for Internet Addiction in 2008. In 2015, the Chinese government also found that more than 500 million citizens over five years old, nearly half the population, suffered from some form of near- sightednessed, and while video games were not solely responsible for this, the government felt they needed to reduce the amount of time youth played video games. China has sought to deal with addiction to video games by its youth by passing regulations to be implemented by video game publishers aimed to limit consecutive play time particularly for children. As early as 2005 China's Ministry of Culture has enacted several public health efforts to address gaming and internet related disorders. One of the first systems required by the government was launched in 2005 to regulate adolescents' Internet use, including limiting daily gaming time to 3 hours and requiring users' identification in online video games. In 2007, an \\"Online Game Anti-Addiction System\\" was implemented for minors, restricting their use to 3 hours or less per day. The ministry also proposed a \\"Comprehensive Prevention Program Plan for Minors’ Online Gaming Addiction\\" in 2013, to promulgate research, particularly on diagnostic methods and interventions. China's Ministry of Education in 2018 announced that new regulations would be introduced to further limit the amount of time spent by minors in online games. While these regulations were not immediately binding, most large Chinese publishers took steps to implement the required features. For example, Tencent restricted the amount of time that children could spend playing one of its online games, to one hour per day for children 12 and under, and two hours per day for children aged . This is facilitated by tracking players via their state-issued identification numbers. This has put some pressure on Western companies that publish via partners in China on how to apply these new anit-addiction requirements into their games, as outside of China, tracking younger players frequently raises privacy concerns. Specialized versions of games, developed by the Chinese partner, have been made to meet these requirements without affecting the rest of the world; Riot Games let its China-based studio implement the requirements into League of Legends for specialized release in China. A new law passed in November 2019 limits children under 18 to less than 90 minutes of playing video games on weekdays and three hours on weekends, with no video game playing allowed between 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. These are set by requiring game publishers to enforce these limits based on user logins. Additionally, the law limits how much any player can spend on microtransactions, ranging from about $28 to $57 per month depending on the age of the player. In September 2020, the government implemented its own name- based authentication system to be made available to all companies to uphold these laws. =Data privacy= Most of the large publishers in China routinely collect data on players and how they play their game. One primary reason is that this is information that may be mandated by the government due to its mass surveillance programs and for implementing systems such as for the anti- addiction measures. Secondly, many of these large companies not only provide video games but a range of media across the spectrum including online video, music, and books, and these companies couple that data to have better reach of targeted advertising as to increase revenues. There are fears, but no reported cases, of these large companies sharing data with the government from foreign users. These fears have had impacts for companies that are fully or partially controlled by Chinese companies. For example, Epic Games in 2018 released its own digital storefront, the Epic Games Store which came under some criticism by players in the West, partially due to fear that Epic would share their data with Tencent and subsequently to the Chinese government, and have called the Store spyware. =Foreign ownership= With the rising success of online games from 2007 onwards, some foreign companies sought to invest full or partial ownership of Chinese companies to help capture a portion of the growing market. The Chinese government, concerned that these foreign companies would have influence on how the Chinese companies manages their video games, passed a law that banned any foreign company from investing or having any type of ownership in a Chinese company, with the General Administration of Press and Publication serving as the watchdog for such violations. This still allows for foreign companies to bring games into China, but only through operating agreements and partnerships with wholly owned Chinese companies. For example, Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft, an extremely popular MMO in China, was run initially through The9 and later by NetEase, both companies making necessary changes to parts of the game to adhere to Chinese content regulations.

Plot summary In 1958, with the impending completion of Tokyo's TV broadcasting tower as a symbol of Japan's escalating post-war economic recovery, rural schoolgirl Mutsuko (Maki Horikita) arrives from the provinces to begin her first job with Suzuki Auto. Initially impressed by meeting company \\"president\\" Norifumi Suzuki (Shinichi Tsutsumi), Mutsuko is shocked to discover her workplace is actually a shabby auto repair shop in Tokyo's down-at-heel Yuhi district. Suzuki is a bad-tempered employer but Mutsuko is welcomed by his wife, Tomoe (Hiroko Yakushimaru), and their impish 5-year-old son, Ippei (Kazuki Koshimizu). One of Ippei's favorite haunts is a five-and-dime store managed by struggling serial writer Ryunosuke Chagawa (Hidetaka Yoshioka). Regarding now-successful writers like Nobel-prize winner Kenzaburo Oe, as overrated, Chagawa wants to be more than a hack churning out sci-fi yarns and selling cheap toys on the side. When alluring newcomer Hiromi (Koyuki) opens a sake bar in the area, she gathers clientele quickly—in dramatically compressed manga style—but also finds herself lumbered with Junnosuke (Kenta Suga) the orphaned offspring of the bar's previous tenant. Drunk, and smitten by Hiromi, Chagawa accepts custodianship of the boy. Reception The film ranked 15th at the Japanese box office in 2005 , and won 12 prizes at the 2006 Japanese Academy Awards, including the awards for Best Film, Director, Actor and Screenplay. It also won the audience award at the 2006 New York Asian Film Festival.

It first aired on January 4, 2007, on NBC, and was the first episode to air after the December holiday hiatus. \\"Back from Vacation\\" was the first script written by Justin Spitzer for the series. Julian Farino served as the episode director. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) returns from his vacation in Jamaica and has a luau in the warehouse to celebrate. It is revealed that he went to Jamaica with Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) when a racy photograph of him and Jan is circulated. Meanwhile, Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) have an argument over Karen's living situation, leading to Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) offering him advice. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was watched by an estimated 8.80 million viewers. Among the 18–49 demographic, it earned a 4.3/11 ratings share and helped NBC finish in first place for the night. \\"Back from Vacation\\" received generally positive reviews from critics, with Carell's performance receiving positive attention in particular. Synopsis Michael Scott (Steve Carell) returns from his Jamaican vacation rejuvenated, and directs the Party Planning Committee to throw a luau-themed party in the warehouse to accompany the annual inventory. When Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) notices Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) in the margins of a photo from Michael's vacation, he admits to the documentary crew that he and Jan went to Jamaica together. Michael attempts to send another vacation photograph to Todd Packer (David Koechner) as proof of the trip, but mistakenly chooses \\"Packaging\\" instead of \\"Packer\\" from the address menu, sending the photograph to the entire shipping warehouse, including Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), the warehouse supervisor. The photo is quickly forwarded throughout the office and beyond. Michael enlists Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) assistance in preventing its spread, but these efforts are largely ineffective. Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) has been upset with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) because he expressed objections to the prospect of Karen moving into an apartment two blocks from his own. Pam convinces Jim that he is being unreasonable, and Jim accepts her advice and apologizes to Karen. Pam tells the documentary crew that she was glad to help Jim, but is then shown later to be crying in private, secretly in love with him and heartbroken over the fact that he is with Karen instead. Dwight walks in on her crying. He awkwardly attempts to console her, although he misunderstands: \\"So, you're PMSing pretty bad, huh?\\" During the luau/inventory, Jan arrives at the office to speak with Michael in private. Michael is terrified that Jan is there to confront him over the widely spread photo, but she appears to be unaware of it, instead confessing her attraction to him against all reason and kissing him. Production \\"Back from Vacation\\" was written by Justin Spitzer, a staff writer who joined The Office in its third season. The episode was his first script for the series. Spitzer found Jan's final scene with Michael – in which he expects she will yell at him for their circulated picture but instead informs him they are staying together – especially tricky to write. Spitzer was unsure how to craft the scene, and eventually requested advice from the other series' writers. They decided that Jan would give a \\"psychobabble\\" response to Michael. Sitting on a panel of television writers at Northwestern University, Spitzer briefly described her reasoning, \\"Jan’s nuts. She has some bad psychiatrist giving her bad advice.\\" He praised the benefits of a \\"good writers room,\\" in which \\"scenes go to this place you never could have gone to alone.\\" \\"Back from Vacation\\" was directed by Julian Farino, who later was responsible for directing \\"The Deposition\\", a fourth season episode that featured some of the ramifications of Michael's circulated picture. Recurring actors Creed Bratton, Ed Helms, Rashida Jones, Craig Robinson, and David Koechner appeared as guest stars in \\"Back from Vacation\\". This was the final episode to feature background character Luanne. The season three DVD contains a number of deleted scenes, such as Michael arriving from Jamaica at the airport, wearing warm-weather clothes, Dwight, Meredith, Angela and Kevin separately reacting to the news that Michael took Jan to Jamaica, and Jan maintaining the ruse that she was in Scottsdale while talking to a coworker at Corporate, who is viewing the photo on his computer. Additional scenes include Dwight complaining about Jim's pranks while Michael was on vacation, Roy helping Ryan with inventory, Andy challenging Dwight to a box-stacking race, and Meredith climbing on a shelf, which falls and traps her. Reception Steve Carell's performance in the episode was a particular source of praise. \\"Back from Vacation\\" first aired on January 4, 2007 in the United States on NBC. It was the first episode of the season to air after the end of the December holiday break. According to Nielsen Media Research, an estimated 8.80 million viewers watched the episode. It earned a 4.3/11 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49, meaning that it was seen by 4.3 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of broadcast. The Office and its lead-in show, My Name Is Earl, helped NBC finish in first place for the night in that demographic. The episode attracted generally positive reviews from critics. Brian Zoromski of IGN rated \\"Back from Vacation\\" 9.7/10, an indication of an \\"amazing\\" episode. Stated highlights included the opening sequence, Carell's performance, and Pam's storyline with Jim and Karen. Zoromski concluded in his review that \\"with so much attention to detail, realistic character reactions, and very few completely over-the-top comedy moments, 'Back from Vacation' is one of the best Office episodes yet this season. We're very glad they're back.\\" AOL TV's Michael Sciannamea expressed surprise that Jan accompanied Michael on his vacation and immediately wanted to discover more about their relationship. He was also intrigued with Dwight's attempt to cheer up Pam, until the PMS joke when he thought it \\"would have been very interesting if Dwight had been a real comfort to her and offered his friendship.\\" Sciannamea concluded that \\"this was just a terrific episode. Well written, well acted, and had you begging for more at the end. What more can you ask for?\\" Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Abby West focused on Carell's acting, explaining that \\"the way that Michael's desire to boast and his healthy fear of offending Jan played out on Steve Carell's face was fantastic. From his braggadocio on the phone with Todd Packer (Packer!) to his death march up the stairs to face Jan, it was a thing of beauty.\\" BuddyTV's Oscar Dahl believed that \\"Back from Vacation\\" was \\"one of the two or three best of the season\\", opining that \\"simplicity\\" was the key to the series' success. Dahl continued, \\"Each episode's premise can be entirely mundane and inconsequential. It will still mine laughs from the situation at hand. We also had some nice development in the Jim-Pam-Karen triangle, with Pam giving Jim relationship advice, then bawling her eyes out afterwards. Maybe the best scene in the episode saw Dwight comfort her.\\" Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A.

In 1986, the brand was involved in a cyanide poisoning hoax, and its sales never recovered. History Procter & Gamble submitted a patent application on 14 March 1983 for its new line of over-the-counter micro- granulated aspirin capsules, to be sold under the name Encaprin, chosen for its phonetic similarity to the word aspirin. The product was first released in January 1984 to a lead market in Tucson, Arizona, and saw its national release in early May. A national television advertising campaign began on July 15, 1984, where it was marketed as a fast acting analgesic, particularly for mild arthritis relief, while being easier on the stomach than traditional aspirin tablets, due to its distributed aspirin micro- granules.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDg7sjrqq4g The brand saw problems early on when a trademark infringement suit was filed by SmithKline Beckman, the makers of Ecotrin. The ruling sided with Procter & Gamble, and they were allowed to keep the Encaprin name. Success for Encaprin was short-lived, however, as the product faced intense competition from Tylenol, other aspirin products, and ibuprofen brands Advil and Nuprin, which were approved for over- the counter sale in May 1984, the same month Encaprin saw its national release. Encaprin was soon embroiled in the product tampering scares following the 1982 Chicago Tylenol murders. On 27 March 1986, an anonymous caller phoned Procter & Gamble claiming he had placed cyanide in capsules of maximum strength Encaprin in Walgreens pharmacies in Chicago and Detroit, leading Walgreens, Kroger supermarkets and SupeRx drug stores to remove the product from all stores nationally. The manufacturer issued a recall and advisory cautions were announced, although many initially suspected the call was a hoax, particularly because there were no Walgreens locations in Detroit at the time. On 5 April 1986, Procter & Gamble announced that no evidence of tampering had been found, and Encaprin was returned to the shelves. Despite the fact that the scare was revealed to be a hoax, Encaprin never recovered its sales and was quietly retired in August 1986. The Encaprin hoax influenced the 1989 FDA federal guidelines for the manufacture of tamper-proof products, which called for a minimum of two layers of tamper-proof packaging for two- piece capsule products, and the use of tamper-proof capsule sealing technologies.

In other words, ideal observer theory states that ethical judgments should be interpreted as statements about the judgments that a neutral and fully informed observer would make; \\"x is good\\" means \\"an ideal observer would approve of x\\". This makes ideal observer theory a subjectivistBrandt 1959, p. 153: \\"[Objectivism and subjectivism] have been used more vaguely, confusedly, and in more different senses than the others we are considering. We suggest as a convenient usage, however, that a theory be called subjectivist if and only if, according to it, any ethical assertion implies that somebody does, or somebody of a certain sort under certain conditions would, take some specified attitude toward something.\\" yet universalist form of cognitivism. Ideal observer theory stands in opposition to other forms of ethical subjectivism (e.g.moral relativism, and individualist ethical subjectivism), as well as to moral realism (which claims that moral propositions refer to objective facts, independent of anyone's attitudes or opinions), error theory (which denies that any moral propositions are true in any sense), and non-cognitivism (which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all). Adam Smith and David Hume espoused versions of the ideal observer theory. Roderick Firth laid out a more sophisticated modern version. According to Firth, an ideal observer has the following specific characteristics: omniscience with respect to nonmoral facts, omnipercipience, disinterestedness, dispassionateness, consistency, and normalcy in all other respects. Notice that, by defining an Ideal Observer as omniscient with respect to nonmoral facts, Firth avoids circular logic that would arise from defining an ideal observer as omniscient in both nonmoral and moral facts. A complete knowledge of morality is not born of itself but is an emergent property of Firth's minimal requirements. There are also sensible restrictions to the trait of omniscience with respect to nonmoral facts. For instance, to make a moral judgment about a case of theft or murder on Earth it is not necessary to know about geological events in another solar system. Those using the ideal observer theory do not usually assert that ideal observers actually exist. An analogous idea in law is the reasonable person criterion.

Rania Town is the biggest grain market in Sirsa district. Geography Rania is situated in the far west of Haryana on the Sirsa-Jeewan Nagar Road. The nearest airports are in Delhi and Chandigarh, both around away while the nearest railway station is at Sirsa. Sirsa city is approximately to the east. Other nearby cities are Ellenabad (), Mandi Dabwali () and Mandi Kalanwali (). The borders of Punjab are around away and those of Rajasthan distant. Some other villages and places near to the town are Jiwan Nagar, Kariwala, SantNagar (Jagmalera), Balasar Farm, Sultan Puria and the Ottu Dam.  History Rania, which means \\"queen\\", was formerly called Bhattian and ruled by a king known as the Bhatti Raja. It was renamed as a result of sati by Rania, Queen of Bhattian Riasayat's King after she heard a rumour that the king had been killed in a nearby village. After Nader Shah retreated from India in 1747 CE, Rania was taken over by the Bhatti Ranghar Rajput freebooter Muhammad Hassan Khan took the possession of Rania, Fatehabad and Rania, and he remained in ongoing tussle with Jat Sikh ruler of Patiala and Jind States for the control of this tract. In 1768 CE Johiya ranghars chieftain, Kamruddin, another vassal of Bikaner State, took over Rania, Fatehabad and Sirsa. In 1774 CE, Jat Sikh ruler of Patiala State, Amar Singh, snatched the paraganas of Rania, Fatehabad and Rania from Bhatti Ranghar Rajput chieftain Muhammad Amir Khan, a vassal of Bikaner State, who retreated to his Bhatner fort (Hanumangarh). In 1774 CE, Mughal forces under Mirza Najaf Khan and Raja Jai Singh signed a treaty with Jat Sikhs and Bikaner state under which Tosham, Hisar, Hansi, Meham and Rohtak were restored to Mughals and Raja Jai Singh became Nazim of Hisar sirkar; Rania-Fathebad-Sirsa tract was restorrd to Bhatti chiefs under Bikaner state; and Jat Sikhs kept the rest of their territory annexed by them in North Haryana (Narwana, Jind and Kaithal). After the death of Najaf Ali Khan, the weak Mughal empire under Shah Alam II invited maratha empire's who took over the whole of Haryana by 1792 CE under Mahadaji Sindhia. George Thomas who held this area under Marathas, became independent ruler of this tract in 1798 Ce, but in 1901 marathas empire ruled by Daulat Rao Sindhia, led by their French-origin general Pierre Cuillier-Perron who allied with Jat Sikhs ruler of Jind, expelled George Thomas from Haryana. Ongoing feud among Bhattis, Johiyas, Jats, Skihs, Marathas and Mughals, weakened them all and this tract came under British raj in 1803.

Additional Spanish translations were done by Jose Aranda and Anthony Trujillo. The book's title is probably inspired by the summer and winter solstices, the \\"lightest\\" and \\"darkest\\" days of the year. These two days also mark two pivotal events in the Kurbs' \\"ritual cycle of acknowledgment\\". Alternatively, since the story is set in New York, \\"City Of Light\\" could refer to one of the many cities of light. Plot synopsis An enigmatic race of beings known as the Kurbs are introduced at the story's outset. Except as serpentine extensions of shadow, they are rarely seen, and thrive only in darkness. Utilizing something called the Power, they are able to control the rhythm of day and night. When humans first arrived on Manhattan Island (a place of apparent significance to the Kurbs), a treaty was signed: the Ritual Cycle of Acknowledgment. The Kurbs would loan the island out for human use, and even share their source of power. But there were conditions: in synchronization with the summer and winter solstices, the source of Power would be ritualistically hidden somewhere on the island, and if it was not found in time, the Kurbs would reclaim the island, and everything would freeze. Over the years, the Power was hidden inside different objects, including an ear of corn, a musket ball, an oil lamp and, most recently, a subway token. A lineage of women were given the responsibility of carrying out the Ritual Cycle Of Acknowledgment, and were granted special powers through the Kurbs' source of Power, as well. This system works for centuries until evil Mr. Underton tried to steal the Power a few years back, and lost his eyesight. Now he is close to stealing it once again, and if he succeeds, the Kurbs will take back the City, reducing it to a dark and frozen tundra. It's up to two kids named Carlos and Sarah to find the subway token with the Power and keep the City safe, despite secrets of Sarah's history that are entwined with the token. What ensues is a race against darkness. A race against the lies of the past. And most of all, a race against time. Style City Of Light, City Of Dark is both a comic book and a novel. It begins like an illustrated storybook: paragraphs of text are accompanied by frequent illustrations, establishing the backstory more quickly than would have been possible with sequential art alone. Comic book panels tell the rest of the story, occasionally helped along by the author's narrations, which are presented in the form of captions. This method of storytelling makes City Of Light, City Of Dark unique. Brian Floca's Franco-Belgian-inspired art style and frequent cross-hatching also give this modern fantasy an appropriately contemporary feel.

The parish was an area bounded by Lake Pontchartrain, mid-city,and two major canals. The parish was carved from St. Raphael Parish in 1953 and the original church was but a small quonset hut built by the men in the parish. They later added an extension wing to it, to make the quonset hut L-shaped to accommodate the growing neighborhood and population in the parish. The quonset hut was accidentally burned to the ground one early morning in 1961 due to an electrical fire. The parish had also built a parochial grammar school for grades kindergarten through eighth grade on the same campus grounds as the church quonset hut and rectory house. Years later, a second building on the campus grounds was built, called the towers, which provided for additional classroom facilities for the grammar school. Years later with more growth the parish and the archdiocese contributed to building a parochial high school across the street from the campus. It was an all-girls academy called St. Joseph Academy for grades 9 through 12. Plans for a new church were already underway when the quonset hut had burned down. The gymnasium of St. Joseph Academy was temporarily used to conduct Masses and other church services until the new church was built. In 1963, the new church structure was completed; it was a masterpiece in architectural design and modernity. The modern stained glass and sweeping arcs of the white roof curved up to the tallest white steeple and steel cross ever seen in this part of the residential lakefront section of New Orleans. The altar of the church was an enormous and masterful single carving in one piece of marble, commissioned in Italy. The altar crucifix was similarly imported. It was a three-dimensional wooden image of the resurrected Christ that was suspended by steel cables that appeared nearly invisible to the naked eye. This very large statue of the risen Christ with flowing robe ascending above the altar provided a unique and reverential atmosphere from all other churches in the city of New Orleans. The pews were made of blanched wood, and the floors a white terrazzo which all further lightened the atmosphere to an almost ethereal quality within the church, especially when reflecting sunlight through the stained glass around the roof's modern arcs. The bottom of the church's great steeple dove past the roof down into the church as four curved pillars and represented structural yet graceful markings bounding the altar area.  After Hurricane Katrina  The church suffered some damage from Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, including wind damages and flood waters from standing in nearly of water for many weeks before the city authorities could drain the flood water from the city. Archdiocese of New Orleans decided not to try and refurbish the church or demolish it and rebuild a new and collect the USD9 million in insurance money and distributed to other parishes that didn't have insurance. The decision was partly because the church's roof was very challenging and costly to maintain requiring constant repairs which often went beyond the parish's means. =Sale to Holy Cross High School= Since Hurricane Katrina, the neighborhoods near this parish were slow to repopulate for the many reasons other New Orleans neighborhoods similarly affected have been slow. The parish members who could attend met several times with the Archdiocese of New Orleans to discuss its rebuilding plans. The Archdiocese declared that it was not planning on bringing the two schools on the campus grounds back to life since they had not yet seen sufficient population in the area to justify this very expensive endeavor. The parish members finally decided to vote and the majority voted to sell the parish campus grounds to Holy Cross High School, formerly located in the lower ninth ward of New Orleans. The Archdiocese agreed and supported this decision. This school is a parochial all (and only) boys school for grades 5 through 12. Holy Cross plans to tear down St. Frances Cabrini church to make room for the relocation of Holy Cross High School (relocating from their 100-year-old historical building and campus grounds on the Mississippi river levee in the lower 9th ward that was severely damaged due to Hurricane Katrina). =Controversy= A Tulane University professor and some other preservation advocates and former and current parishioners appealed to the U.S. Federal Preservation authorities to prevent Holy Cross from demolishing St. Frances Cabrini Church citing its historical significance and magnificence for modern architecture of that era. Holy Cross's plans were in jeopardy for a period of time while the preservation review took place. Subsequently, the review resulted in acknowledging the historical significance and magnificence of the church's architecture and history, but stopped short of requiring that the church must be preserved. Holy Cross is now proceeding with its plans and committed to place some sort of memorial where the magnificent Church once stood. The Archdiocese of New Orleans intends to store any items from the Church which are salvageable given the parish member's intentions to restore the parish and build a new church on nearby grounds sometime in the future.

It is the world's biggest e-commerce website and seventh most visited website according to Alexa. Taobao.com has registered 2003-04-21 with domain registrar Alibaba Cloud Computing (Beijing) Co., Ltd. The website was founded by Alibaba Group in 2003. Taobao Marketplace facilitates consumer- to-consumer (C2C) retail by providing a platform for small businesses and individual entrepreneurs to open online stores that mainly cater to consumers in Chinese-speaking regions (Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) and abroad, which is made payable by online cellphone accounts. Its stores usually offer an express delivery-service to their clientele. With over 1 billion product listings as of 2016, the combined transaction volume of Taobao Marketplace and Tmall.com reached 3 trillion yuan in 2017, more than that of all US e-commerce sites combined. The Economist calls it \\"the country's biggest online marketplace\\". Sellers are able to post goods for sale either through a fixed price or auction. Auctions make up a small percentage of transactions. The majority of the products are new merchandise sold at fixed prices. Buyers can assess seller backgrounds by information available on the site, including ratings, comments and complaints.  History  Taobao Marketplace (formerly \\"Taobao\\") was launched in May 2003 by Alibaba after eBay acquired Eachnet, China's online auction leader at the time, for US$180 million and became a major player in the Chinese consumer e-commerce market. To counter eBay's expansion, Taobao offered free listings to sellers and introduced website features designed to act in local consumers' best interests, such as instant messaging for facilitating buyer-seller communication and an escrow-based payment tool, Alipay. As a result, Taobao became mainland China's undisputed market leader within two years. Its market share surged from 8% to 59% between 2003 and 2005, while eBay China plunged from 79% to 36%. EBay shut down its China site in 2006. In April 2008, Taobao introduced a newly dedicated B2C platform called Taobao Mall to complement its C2C marketplace. Taobao Mall established itself as the destination for quality brand name goods for Chinese consumers. Taobao Mall launched an independent web domain, Tmall.com, and enhanced its focus on product verticals and improvements in shopping experience in November 2010. It became an independent business in June 2011 and changed its Chinese name to Tian Mao (Tmall) in January 2012. As of October 2013 it was the eighth most visited web site in China. In 2008, Taobao fueled the overall growth of the Chinese online shopping industry through execution of the “Big Taobao” strategy with the aim of becoming a provider of e-commerce infrastructure services for all e-commerce market participants. In October 2010, Taobao beta launched eTao as an independent searching engine for online shopping, providing product and merchant information from a number of major consumer e-commerce websites in China. Online shoppers can use the site to compare prices from different sellers and identify products to buy. According to the Alibaba Group web site, eTao offers products from Amazon China, Dangdang, Gome, Yihaodian, Nike China and Vancl, as well as Taobao and Tmall. In May 2011, Alibaba Group opened a retail store in Beijing under the Taobao Mall brand. The five-story 25,000sqm Taobao Mall iFengChao Furniture Showroom opened as a complement to their online stores. In June 2011, Alibaba Group Executive Chairman and former CEO Jack Ma announced that Taobao would split into three different companies: Taobao Marketplace (a C2C platform), Tmall.com (a B2C platform; then called Taobao Mall), and eTao (a search engine for online shopping). The move was said to be necessary for Taobao to “meet competitive threats that emerged in the past two years during which the Internet and e-commerce landscape has changed dramatically.” From 2012 onward, Taobao began to accept international Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards;淘宝全面接受海外信用卡付款, Taobao.com prior, only domestic banks were supported by AliPay.2011-10-19, 支付宝将向全球开放 国外用户可购物淘宝, Phoenix TV Finance On April 29, 2013, Alibaba announced an investment of US$586 million in Sina Weibo. According to Reuters, the deal “should drive more web traffic to Alibaba's Taobao Marketplace, China's largest e-commerce website with a consumer focus.” On August 1, 2013, Alibaba launched Weibo for Taobao, which allows users to link Sina Weibo accounts with Taobao accounts.Alibaba Released Weibo for Taobao with Sina China Internet Watch, August 5, 2013  Services and features  = Mascot = Taobao's mascot is a dialogue bubble, which represents their corporate culture. Ma introduced Taobao to the outside world by stating, \\"We are the ant army.\\" Ma once organized more than 2,000 employees at a gymnasium to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the founding ceremony. At the party, Taobao employees waved the Taobao mascot — the flag of \\"ants.\\" At the end of the celebration that lasted for four hours, all the employees stood hand-in-hand, singing \\"If you do not experience wind and rain, you cannot see the rainbow. The ants that be organized together can beat the elephant.\\" = Shop feedback = To thoroughly investigate a Taobao shop, a good way is to view its feedback by clicking the shop's rating icon. For Tmall.com shops, people click the stars to view their ratings. Taobao users usually spend time to read feedback and compare items of one shop with those of others. Feedback put up by the user can be genuine or made up which users have to thoroughly read through to conclude. If the feedback style and tone is same, likely, it's made up. Some of the feedback can also be posted by competitors. Users have to look at the majority of the feedback to deduce whether the feedback are genuine. The best way to conclude whether the item is truly worth buying is to look at the available feedback that are posted by users after they've used the item for a period of time. For every trade deal on Taobao, there must be a section of customer feedback, which is a determination factor of the sale volume for the shop. Therefore, the shop owners often put effort to maximize the positive comments and eliminate the negative ones. Even profitable negotiations happen between sellers and the consumers for rating their satisfactions toward the commodity and their shopping experiences. In order to collect public perspectives towards Taobao services, searching tools and other functions are used to determine and learn the users’ demands, which could help Taobao make more improvements; There are also surveys handed out to Taobao consumers including the following parts: ·The obstacles that you encounter while using the product. ·Your advises and reviews of the product. ·The frequencies of your uses on the product, or the importance of that particular product to the users themselves. ·The satisfaction level towards the specific aspects, including visual and typographic layout, procedure and instruction guide. ·The overall satisfaction level towards the product. = Alipay = Launched in 2004, Alipay (), an escrow-based online payment platform, is the preferred payment solution for transactions on Taobao Marketplace. It is the most widely used third-party online payment solution in China. To ensure safe transactions, Alipay uses an escrow system through which payment is only released to the seller once the buyer has received his or her goods in satisfactory condition. According to the Alibaba Group web site, Alipay is partnered with multiple financial institutions as well as Visa and MasterCard to facilitate payments in China and abroad. Alipay systems are separate for different groups of users. For instance, Alipay users may send and receive funds if they have an account that added a credit card issued in China, whereas users who use credit cards issued outside China may only use Alipay to pay for goods or services from Taobao. This has proven problematic for international users of Taobao, as they are unable to receive refunds that are not issued via the Taobao system. Regulatory changes issued by the People's Bank of China (Central Bank of China) are set to alter the Chinese online payment ecosystem forever. Top-tier digital payment services such as WeChat Pay and Alipay are expected to transfer all relevant transaction data to appropriate agencies starting June 30, 2018. = AliExpress = Aliexpress AliExpress was created in April 2010 as an international retailing website. People who live overseas can use the service to purchase items from Chinese manufactures online. = AliWangWang (TradeManager) = A distinctive feature of shopping on Taobao Marketplace is the ease of communication between buyer and seller prior to the purchase through its embedded proprietary instant chat program, named AliWangWang (). It has become a habit among Chinese online shoppers to interact with the sellers through AliWangWang to inquire about products and to bargain prior to purchasing products. = Baopals = In February 2016, 3 expats living in Shanghai launched Baopals, a shopping platform that translates Taobao and Tmall into English so that foreigners living in China can access all of its products and services. Currently, over 2.4 million items have been sold on the platform. = Happy Taobao = In Dec. 2009, Taobao, together with Hunan TV, set up Happy Taobao, Inc for television shopping. Hunan TV launched an entertainment series called \\"Happy Taobao\\", while Taobao Marketplace created channels and independent websites. = Other services = Taobao Marketplace introduced various features and services to create a better user experience for online shoppers and retailers. For instance, in January 2010, it launched the Taobao app, created by independent developers through the Taobao Open Platform, to be downloaded by consumers in Taobao App Store. In March 2010, it introduced the Taobao Data Cube platform, which gives small businesses access to its aggregate consumer transactions data for insight into industry trends. In June 2010, it partnered with Wasu Media Internet Limited to launch Taohua, a digital entertainment products platform, and interactive digital television shopping, that are operated by a joint-venture formed by the two companies. = Digital Marketing = Singles' Day Singles' Day (also known as the Double eleven shopping carnival) is the Chinese largest online shopping day in 11th, Nov., which dates from 11th, Nov. 2009 by the Taobao mall. It takes the advantages of the Chinese single day which is created by Chinese students in university to celebrate their bachelordom. After the event was launched, it obtained unexpected attention so many other e-commerce company tried to imitate this model. However, Taobao mall is still the best beneficiary by its accurate and powerful promotion skills till now. The double eleven shopping day has gained a large number of profit for Taobao since 2009. The sales value on double eleven in 2009 was RMB50 million (￡5.68 million) and the value has increased sharply to RMB35 billion (￡3.97 billion) and the RMB1.5 billion(￡170million) was gained. Here are the volume of transaction from 2009 to 2019 on Taobao mall for November 11: 2009: RMB50 million (￡5.68 million) 2010: RMB900 million (￡102 million) 2011: RMB3.4 billion (￡386 million) 2012: RMB19.1 billion (￡2.17 billion) 2013: RMB35 billion (￡3.97 billion) 2015: RMB91.2 billion 2016: RMB120.7 billion2017: RMB168.2 billion 2018: RMB213.5 billion 2019: RMB268.4 billion It also shows great power from 2014 to 2018, with the volume of transaction from 213.5 billion in 2018. The continuous successes of Taobao mall double eleven shopping carnival contributes to its varieties of promotion skills and the supportive of quantities of firms. In 2016, Alibaba has introduce the T-mall double eleven party, it invited many popular stars, singers and supermodel who took part in Victoria secret show.

In the 2017 double eleven party, Jack Ma came out with his new film Gong Shou Dao which means defend the homeland with Kungfu. Now, because of the huge trading volume and income in Singles Day(11/11), Taobao has launched another promotional activity on December 12, which is the similar e-commerce sales day to Singles' Day. Since then, the volume of trading has set a new high every year. = Developing Strategy = On March 29, 2016, the CEO of Alibaba group, Daniel Zhang, pointed out the three directions of the future development goals for Taobao: more community-based, more content-enabled and local adapted in the 2016 annual customer conference held in Hangzhou. Taobao extensively uses shopping strategies such as data personalizing, customer loyalties, video broadcasting and the focused demand of a single community to build stages for sellers to display their commodities. It is strictly constructing a new ecosystem from content producing, to content propagating, and content consuming with Alibaba's cooperating internet platforms like Youku, Weibo, Alimama and Alifilms. Except for using centralized and demand- matching supplies depending on the need of users to form a self-operational system of content producing and consuming transmission, Taobao also improved the quality of the commodity and its services towards the consumers. = Adaptive Agent = Taobao applies a searching tool named 'adaptive agents'. An adaptive agent picks up the signals from consumers’ purchase records, including categories, brands, functions and colors etc.; The search engine involves the scanning of a particular bar code. Taobao tracks customers' purchasing history and reorganize it into a series of selections that the buyers are likely to be attracted to. The way that an adaptive agent works is image prior models plus the posterior data using BAYES theory (LAPLACE method): The possibility of the occurrence of a certain event can be estimated through the frequency of its occurrence in the past. The ranking of a product or a page can be determined by the combination of its prior information plus its posterior data of click transaction. The popularity of Taobao's searching model is based on the calculation of correlation rate and quality scores: *The static score of a product's title (correlation rate). *The matching score of the title and query of a product (correlation rate). *The category model of a product (correlation rate). *The transaction model of the commodity (quality score). *The sellers model (quality score). *The feedback (quality score). Taobao increased its traffic by launching an app. = Semantic Search = Taobao automatically classifies the text and images of the product, and uses tags to make the correlation match. The usage of the semantic search is to solve the correlative problem that key word texts cannot solve, such as images, complex texts, and ambiguous texts. Semantic search is also a way of recommendation that Taobao presents with more similar items consumers might find when searching one keyword. There are entity tagging and other classifications. = Taobao for Southeast Asia = In September, 2013, Taobao launched its Southeast Asian site. A translation feature is now available on Taobao.com for major languages in Southeast Asia. = Taobao Live = In 2018, Alibaba launched the livestreaming service named Alibaba Live. This service was created with the goal of allowing online retailers to market their products utilizing the online phenomenon called social shopping.This has seen significant growth in popularity and success, with 84 stores using this service reporting $7.4 million in sales. Taobao also has stated that they predict live-streaming on their platform will generate over 500 billion sales transactions. Alibaba has also started to promote a new style of live streaming on their platform, called cūnbō (村播), which features rural sellers. Taobao has even given them their own category in the app, with the purpose of making it easier for these rural sellers to find customers and followers on the platform. = Weitao = Weitao is a private shopping assistant/blog for Taobao/Tmall customers. It is a micro-blogging feature for use on its e-commerce sites Taobao and Tmall, to bring brands and merchants closer to their fans.  Controversy  In August 2017, the company removed controversial vendors offering personalised messages featuring African children over concerns of child exploitation. In 2019, Taobao removed all items related to Houston Rockets in response to the organization's general manager posting a tweet about Hong Kong.  Metrics  Taobao Marketplace had more than 5 million registered users as of June 2013 and hosted more than 80 million product listings. It facilitated approximately RMB 200 billion in gross merchandise volume in 2009. In September 2013, Taobao ranked 12th overall in Alexa's internet rankings. For the year ending March 31, 2013, the combined gross merchandise volume (GMV) of Taobao and Tmall.com combined exceeded RMB 1 trillion.

In 2015, Alipay moved its headquarters to Pudong, Shanghai, although its parent company Ant Financial remains Hangzhou-based. Alipay overtook PayPal as the world's largest mobile payment platform in 2013. As of 31 March 2018, the number of Alipay users reached 870 million. It is the world's number one mobile payment service organization and the second largest payment service organization in the world. According to the statistics of the fourth quarter of 2018, Alipay has a 55.32% share of the third-party payment market in mainland China, and it continues to grow.  History  The service was first launched in 2003, by Taobao. The PBOC, China's central bank, issued licensing regulations in June 2010 for third-party payment providers. It also issued separate guidelines for foreign-funded payment institutions. Because of this, Alipay, which accounted for half of China's non-bank online payment market, was restructured as a domestic company controlled by Alibaba CEO Jack Ma in order to facilitate the regulatory approval for the license. The 2010 transfer of Alipay's ownership was controversial, with media reports in 2011 that Yahoo! and Softbank (Alibaba Group's controlling shareholders) were not informed of the sale for nominal value. Chinese business publications Century Weekly criticised Ma, who stated that Alibaba Group's board of directors was aware of the transaction. The incident was criticised in foreign and Chinese media as harming foreign trust in making Chinese investments. The ownership dispute was resolved by Alibaba Group, Yahoo!, and Softbank in July 2011. In 2013 Alipay launched a financial product platform called Yu'ebao (余额宝). As of June 2013 the company still had what it called \\"a minor paperwork problem\\" with the China Securities Regulatory Commission, but the company said that they planned to expand the product while these are sorted out. In 2015, Alipay's parent company was re-branded as Ant Financial Services Group. In 2017, Alipay unveiled their facial recognition payment service.  Services  Food ordering with Alipay in Mainland China Alipay claims it operates with more than 65 financial institutions including Visa and MasterCard to provide payment services for Taobao and Tmall as well as more than 460,000 online and local Chinese businesses. Alipay is used in smartphones with their Alipay Wallet app. QR code payment codes are used for local in-store payments. The Alipay app also provides features such as credit card bills payment, bank account managements, P2P transfer, prepay mobile phone top-up, bus and train ticket purchase, food order, vehicle for hire, insurance selection, digital identification document storage. Alipay also allows online check-out on most Chinese-based websites such as Taobao and Tmall. The Alipay app allows users to add their own services provided from different companies to create a more personalised experience. Since late-2008, Alipay has promoted public service payment services and has covered more than 300 cities nationwide, supporting more than 1,200 partner organizations. In addition to utility bills such as water and electricity, Alipay also extends their services to areas such as paying transportation fines, property fees, and cable television fees. Common online payment services also include hydropower coal payment, tuition payment and traffic fine. On 15 January 2009, Alipay launched a credit card repayment service, supporting 39 domestic bank-issued credit cards. It is currently the most popular third-party repayment platform. The main advantages are free credit card bills checking, repayments with no administrative fee, as well as automatic repayment, repayment reminders and other value-added services. In the first quarter of 2014, 76% of credit cards were also paid by Alipay Wallet. From December 2013, several chain convenience store companies, including Meiyijia, Hongqi Chain, and Qishiduo C-STORE and 7-Eleven, have successively supported Alipay payment; in December, Beijing taxi drivers began to accept Alipay to pay the fare. Subsequently, Wanda Cinema, Joy City, Wangfujing and other large-scale retail companies as well as movie theaters, KTV, and catering companies have access to Alipay. From March 26, 2019, the service fee will be charged for the payment of credit card through Alipay. Customers only pay the portion of the payment that exceeds 2,000 yuan at 0.1%. In November 2019, Alipay introduced Tourpass, a service component that allows non-Chinese users to use its mobile payment feature by pre-loading Chinese Yuan equivalent foreign currency into the app. In 2020, Alipay used QR code system to help in containing COVID-19 outbreak. The health code system tags users one of three colors according to their location, basic health information and travel history.  International expansion  Internationally, more than 300 worldwide merchants use Alipay to sell directly to consumers in China. It currently supports transactions in 18 major foreign currencies. Since the launch of Alipay in the Mainland China, Ant Financial introduced a series of expansion of the services to other countries. = Asia =  Bangladesh  In 2018, Alipay bought 20% shares in Bangladeshi mobile financial service provider bKash Limited.  Hong Kong  Signage shown in Hong Kong, welcoming both Mainland China version of Alipay and AlipayHK In 2017, Ant Financial introduced their expansion of service to Hong Kong. They launched Alipay Payment Services (HK) Ltd. and the \\"AlipayHK\\" brand as a joint venture with CK Hutchison. They launched a standalone app providing features such as mobile payment and P2P transfer. All transactions are settled and paid with Hong Kong dollar instead of Renminbi. The service is now available in major chain stores such as McDonald's, 7-Eleven and Circle K. Wet markets and other merchants are also further supported.  Japan  Alipay entered Japan in 2015, with network up to 38,000. Ant Financial hopes that their network in Japan could help Chinese tourists that are heading to Japan.  Singapore  In 2017, Ant Financial partnered with CC Financial, a start-up company in Singapore. Alipay plans to expand its 20,000 acceptance points in Singapore, and open up their platform to Singapore banking users.  South Korea  Alipay was introduced in South Korea in 2015, and is now available at various merchants around the country. Users can even receive an instant tax refund at four major airports in the country. In 2019, taxis in Seoul and Starbucks will accept Alipay via Kakaopay.  Viet Nam  Alipay entered Viet Nam in 2010, with network up to 21,000. Ant Financial hopes that their network in VietNam could help Chinese order, touris, that are heading to Viet Nam.Currently in Vietnam, to pay via alipay, you can use Davitrans, the address of a company specializing in Chinese purchases. = Oceania = = Australia = In February 2019, Alipay and Tourism Australia announced a service to promote Australian destinations to Chinese tourists using the city of Sydney as a 12-month pilot project. The new Sydney City Card will introduce an interactive city map in the Alipay app to alert tourists to participating locations and retailers where Alipay payments are welcomed. A similar initiative will be trialed concurrently in Queenstown, New Zealand. = North America =  United States  Ant Financial has partnered with First Data in 2017. It allows Alipay service to be used at point-of-sale with more than four million retail partners in United States.  Canada  In 2017, Alipay partnered with SnapPay to allow Canadian retailers to accept Chinese currency from Chinese shoppers. There are currently 800 merchants in Canada that supports Alipay, including most Cadillac Fairview mall locations in partnership with OTT Pay, such as the flagship Eaton Center of Toronto and CF Chinook Centre in Calgary. Air Canada began allowing transactions in Alipay to book flights from Canada and the United States beginning in August 2018, after initially rolling out the feature for booking of flights originating from China. = Europe =  Iceland  Alipay has partnered with Splitti and ePassi in Iceland.  Italy  Alipay partnered with UniCredit, SIA and Banca Sella Group to enable app payments in physical and online stores in Italy.  Norway  Alipay has started cooperating with Vipps in Norway. 30 shops in Bergen are ready to receive Alipay-customers, and in January 2019 some shops in Oslo will be ready.  United Kingdom  Alipay partnered with Barclaycard in United Kingdom, bringing Alipay to UK retailers.  Security  Alipay provides multiple security mechanisms to make sure that user accounts are safe. An Alipay account requires the user to set up their own login password and separate payment password, which need to be different. The user can enter the login password up to five times and the payment password up to three times before the user is locked out of his or her account. To regain access to the account, the user must contact Alipay. A user must also install a digital certificate, which can encrypt information sent over a network, preventing hackers from stealing passwords, thereby enhancing the security of online transactions.  Comparison with other payment systems  Alipay is conceptually similar to Apple Pay, WeChat Pay and PayPal because it overlays traditional card payment methods. Although users receive immediate notification of the transaction, the main difference among Alipay and an instant payment system, like Venmo or Zelle is that the funds transfer between counterparties is not immediate. The settlement time depends on the payment method chosen by the customer, while for instant payment systems, the funds are transferred within seconds or minutes.

She is thought to be the first woman in Iowa who was actually engaged in practice and the fourth woman admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of Iowa. In her time she was known as \\"The Iowa Lawyer\\". Early life Judith Ellen Horton was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, on November 3, 1840. Her father was Rev. Jotham Horton (1798–1853), a Methodist preacher and abolitionist, and her mother was Judith Delano (1799–1847). On both parents' sides she descended from the English Puritans who migrated to New England in the 1630s. Jotham Horton descended from Barnabas Horton (1600–1680) and his son Joseph Horton (1625–1696); the Hortons were originally from Leicestershire, England, and immigrated to America on the ship Swallow, captained by Jeremy Horton. They settled at Hampton, New Hampshire, but soon moved to New Haven, Connecticut, in 1640, and lastly at Southold, Long Island. Judith Delano descended from the De Lannoy family; the Fortune ship which replaced another ship, the Speedwell, arrived from England and sailed to Plymouth Colony in early July 1621, arriving on November 9, 1621, with Philippe De Lannoy among its passengers. Being too radical for the Methodist Episcopal Church, Rev. Jotham Horton entered the Wesleyan Church. His eldest son, Jotham W. Horton, was killed by a mob on August 5, 1866 after the New Orleans Race Riot of July 30, 1866. At the time, he was pastor of the Coloseum Place Church. Judith Horton was educated in public school and then at the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary, Lima, New York. Her parents died when she was still at the seminary, after which she went to live with her sister in Boston and became a teacher. Career J. Ellen Foster (1883) After her second marriage in 1869, she studied law and was admitted to the bar at Clinton, Iowa, in 1872. She occasionally helped her husband in trial cases, and is thought to be the first woman in Iowa who was actually engaged in practice. She was admitted to practice in the Supreme Court of Iowa on October 20, 1875, being the fourth woman admitted to practice before that tribunal. At first, she practiced alone, but afterwards, formed a partnership with her husband. She followed the legal profession for a number of years. In her time, she was known as \\"The Iowa Lawyer\\". Foster was a Methodist and joined the temperance workers when the crusade opened. Her home in Clinton was burned, presumably by opponents of temperance. As a member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, she served as superintendent of the legislative department. Her knowledge of law enabled her to help the movement for the adoption of constitutional amendments in the various states aimed at securing the prohibition of the sale and manufacture of alcoholic liquors. She wrote a pamphlet on the legal bearings of the question. She was popular and successful as a lecturer: the DeWitt Observer reported on June 5, 1874, that \\"one of the best temperance lectures we ever listened to was delivered in the M. E. Church last Sabbath evening by Mrs. Foster of Clinton. The house was filled to overflowing. The audience was delighted with the lecture.\\" J. Ellen Foster (before 1889) In 1887, Foster visited Europe, where she studied the temperance question. In England she addressed large audiences. Returning to the United States, she took part in the International Council of Women in Washington. She published the Constitutional Amendment Manual (1882) and a number of pamphlets and magazine articles on temperance. Foster at the World's Congress (1893) Foster was a pronounced suffragist. She maintained that no organization had the right to pledge the influence of its members to any other organization for any purpose. Her views naturally led her to affiliate with the Non-Partisan League, and she served that body for several years as corresponding secretary, having her office in Boston. She served her own state union as corresponding secretary and president for many years. J. Ellen Foster In 1900, Foster was with the Taft Commission in the Philippines to study the conditions of women and children there. Attorney General George W. Wickersham appointed her a member of a committee to investigate conditions in Federal prisons. As a representative of the American Red Cross, Foster and Clara Barton were sent to St. Petersburg by Secretary of State John Hay in 1902. In 1906 President Theodore Roosevelt appointed her to study conditions of woman and child workers throughout the nation. In 1907 she was appointed a special agent of the Department of Justice, and in 1908 she advocated the addition of a woman's wing to the Federal prison at Fort Leavenworth. For many years Foster was the president of the Women's Republican Association and an active member of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Young Women's Christian Association. Personal life On March 14, 1860, she married Addison Avery Jr. (1837–1913) in Boston. They had one daughter, Mary Elizabeth, who died at the age of 5, and one son, William Horton Avery (1863–1946), who later changed the name to Foster. The marriage with Avery ended in divorce. While in Chicago doing mission work, Horton met Elijah Caleb Foster (1844–1906), a lawyer. Horton moved to Clinton, Iowa, where on July 25, 1869, she married Foster. They had one son, Emory Miller Foster (1870–1907). Two daughters died young. In 1880, the family moved to Washington D.C., where E. C. Foster was appointed to the Department of the Treasury. She died on August 11, 1910 and is buried at Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.).

It can be practiced at any grade level. This philosophy prioritizes active participation, relationship building, flexible and adaptable methods, inquiry, and play-based learning. Curriculum is child- initiated, collaborative and responsive to the children's needs. Proponents of this style of teaching advocate that knowledge of the children is the key to success in your program (Cassidy, Mims, Rucker, & Boone, 2003; Crowther, 2005). To plan an emergent curriculum requires observation, documentation, creative brainstorming, flexibility and patience. Rather than starting with a lesson plan which requires a “hook” to get the children interested, emergent curriculum starts with the observation of the children for insight into their interests. Additionally, content is influenced by values held for the children's learning by the school, community, family and culture (MachLachlan, 2013). The classroom typically consists of learning centres that expand and facilitate children's learning (Crowther, 2005) and encourage independent learning skills (MachLachlan, 2013).  Teacher as Facilitator of Learning  Teachers who employ emergent curriculum understand that the trajectory of learning happens as a consequence of the children's genuine interest, response, and connection to the subject (Crowther, 2005; Jones & Reynolds, 2011, MachLachlan et al., 2013). In order for this to happen, the teacher must consider their position as a facilitator in the classroom. This role involves careful observations of the children and their play as well as flexibility and creativity in order to develop learning opportunities that align with their interests (Cassidy et al., 2003; Crowther, 2005; Jones & Reynolds, 2011; Stacey, 2009a/2011b; Machlachlan et al., 2013; Wein, 2008; Wright, 1997). Carolyn Edwards notes: “The teachers honestly do not know where the group will end up. Although this openness adds a dimension of difficulty to their work, it also makes it more exciting.” (Edwards, Gandini & Foreman, 1993, pp. 159). Teachers in these settings act as researchers who are constantly learning in their roles by collecting data, implementing strategies and assessing their outcomes (MachLachlan et al., 2013; Stacey, 2009). Success in implementing emergent curriculum requires a curious disposition about children and their learning (Stacey, 2009). It is the role of the teacher to be a participant- observer in the children's play (Wright, 1997). These programs give power to children's voices and are consistently scaffolding their learning (Stacey, 2009). The teacher is constantly going through the process of observing and documenting, planning learning experiences, implementing plans, documenting and beginning the cycle again (Crowther, 2005; MachLachlan et al., 2013; Stacey, 2009a/ 2011b). In these types of settings, a few educational initiatives are often implemented by teachers. For example, learning is viewed as a process-oriented experience where children are praised for their effort over final product (Stacey, 2011; Wright, 1997). Additionally, children in these settings are given options and choice about how they wish to spend their time, activities and learning centres they wish to participate in and how they engage in organized activities (Stacey, 2009). This is believed to develop curiosity, initiative, self-direction and persistence (MachLachlan et al., 2013). Because the curriculum is continually changing, developing and growing, teachers need to ensure that they make time to reflect on their observations and strategies implemented (Stacey 2009a/2011b). One way to engage in reflection is through discussion with colleagues (Stacey, 2009). Reflection allows the teacher to think about what happens next in the child's learning, how to proceed, and what to look for in future observations (Stacey, 2011). It is important for teachers to be aware of their own knowledge and where it is lacking, as this type of environment can lead to investigations in an unlimited number of directions (Crowther, 2005). Teachers are also individuals with interests and passions, and sharing these with the class can provide a great opportunity to model knowledge and enthusiasm (MachLachlan et al., 2013). These programs are meant to be culturally responsive and inclusive in nature, so that all children are able to work at their own pace (Crowther, 2005). To help facilitate this, teachers follow the children's lead, expand on their interests, provide meaningful and developmentally appropriate materials, and promote independent learning skills (Crowther, 2005; Stacey, 2009; Wien, 2008).  Planning an Emergent Curriculum  Once teachers see an interest “emerging” they brainstorm ways to study the topic in depth. From these observations and brainstorming, the teacher comes up activities that compliment and build upon the emerging interest, with opportunities for play at multiple ability levels. Once activities have been implemented, the teacher observes the children's use of them, constantly modifying them to accommodate increasing interest or change in direction of the learning. The teacher documents these observations and reflects on the effectiveness of the activities. Then the process begins again. The teacher may be at different levels of this planning cycle for multiple activities or learning outcomes at once (Cassidy et al., 2003; Crowther, 2005; Jones & Reynolds, 2011; Stacey, 2009a/2011b; Machlachlan et al., 2013; Wein, 2008; Wright, 1997). In these settings, learning plans are often more of a loose outline because, in order for the program to be successful, there is often spontaneous deterrence from plans to support engagement (MachLachlan et al., 2013; Stacey, 2009). Webbing is often used because of its flexible nature. A web doesn’t show everything that will be learned, it shows many things that could be learned as well as connections to curriculum expectations (MachLachlan et al., 2013). However, it is important to use the web as a tool to open the teacher to possibilities not a “plan.” Teachers brainstorm many possibilities for study sparked from the particular interest, not as a plan but more as a ‘road map’ as one teacher put it: To get a plan, we chose an idea and brainstormed ways that children could play it – hands-on activities we could provide. Putting all the activities on a web gives you a road map full of possible journeys. (Jones p. 129) An idea for a curriculum topic may be sparked by things, people, events in the environment, issues that arise in the classroom, etc. (MachLachlan et al., 2013; Stacey, 2009). For instance, a teacher may overhear a group of students having a discussion about bugs that leads to the class sitting down and coming up with a web topic that explores all the possible directions the class could go in their quest to learn all they can about the topic of bugs. Ideas may also be sparked by offering experiences such as taking a walk through the neighborhood, visiting local businesses, or reading books. These classrooms are often organized into core curriculum areas, where activities may have a curricular theme while following student interest (Crowther, 2005). For example, while students are demonstrating an interest in restaurants, the literacy area may allow opportunity to write customer orders while the math area may have plastic money for the children to experiment with. These centres are meant to encourage active participation with the content (Crowther, 2005). In emergent curriculum settings, there should be opportunity to involve all the senses, challenge creativity, hear and use oral and written language, explore art media, practice solving interpersonal problems, conduct investigations and ask questions, explore and order material, and acquire various physical skills (Crowther, 2005; MachLachlan et al., 2013; Wright, 1997). Teachers see learning as a process through which children first engage in exploration and physical action which then leads to mastery of skills (MachLachlan et al., 2013). Some researchers argue that this method of planning is more effective for learning because it relies on the intrinsic motivation of students, therefore facilitating increased engagement with the material (Stacey, 2011). However, because of this, it is normal to have multiple children or groups interested in completely different content (Stacey 2009a/2011b). This makes documentation and preparation very important. Emergent learning classrooms still maintain much of the structure of a regular classroom. It is important for children to still experience schedule and organization. Therefore, in these classrooms you will often still find large and small group instructional times, but the implementation of them is more flexible (Stacey 2009a/2011b).  The Learning Environment  Because emergent curriculum programs emphasize independence and persistence in their programs, learning centres are typically set up in very particular ways. Items and materials that are stored are easily accessible to the children visually and physically. Things are usually labeled with words and pictures to assist children, and clear storage containers are preferred (Crowther, 2005; Jones & Reynolds, 2011; Stacey, 2011). Students can be seen working in a variety of social environments. The learning environment should offer opportunities to work in groups of all different sizes, as well as individually (Crowther, 2005). Students are also given opportunities to experience materials in different ways, such as quiet reading corners and dramatic play areas (Stacey, 2011) \\"Reggio Emilia\\" schools are an example of early childhood services that use an emergent approach.  Documentation  Documentation is a very important and very time consuming aspect of this type of programming (Stacey, 2011). Because teachers are held accountable to parents, licensing boards and colleagues, it is necessary that thorough documentation is kept (Crowther, 2005; Stacey, 2009). = Documentation for Observation and Assessment = Because of the reliance on observational methods to inform planning and assessment, it is crucial for teachers to have strategies in place to expedite the process. Some examples of tools use by teachers are sticky notes, observation baskets around the room to collect small anecdotal notes, file folder systems for each student or area of the classroom, clipboards, digital recorders, photography, and video and audiotaping. These methods allow learning to become visually represented and are good for reflection and validation of methods (Stacey, 2009). These strategies can be effective in ensuring proper assessment procedures (Cassidy et al., 2003). The use of student portfolios can be a great way to assess learning and share it with parents/guardians (Stacey 2009a/2011b). Additionally, the use of pre populated data collection sheets can be helpful to keep good records (Stacey, 2011) = Documentation for Planning = Use of webs and other graphic organizers can be a good way to demonstrate how the students are being exposed to curriculum expectations and brainstorm related ideas (MachLachlan et al., 2013; Stacey, 2009). Keeping track of interest paths that develop in the classroom can help teachers demonstrate the process of learning, revise and reflect on it and develop future directions (Stacey, 2009). Each learning or interest centre in the classroom usually has its own plan, as well as activities facilitated by the teacher (Stacey, 2011). = Documentation for Students = Emergent curriculum involved students being collaborative partners in their learning (Stacey, 2009), therefore it is important to incorporate children in displaying and documenting their learning (; Stacey, 2009; Wright, 1997). Some strategies teachers can use for this are audio and visual recordings, samples of children's work, photos, learning logs, and display boards (Stacey, 2009). These approaches can help students develop pride in their work, show off skills to parents/guardians, and display their interests (Crowther, 2005). These processes are not static, rather these projects grow as learning develops (Crowther, 2005).  References  *Booth, Cleta. “The Fiber Project: One Teacher’s Adventure Toward Emergent Curriculum”.

Life  Edward Cowie was born in Birmingham, England, in 1943 and spent most of his early life in the rural countryside. This first-hand experience of nature was to have a profound influence on his life and work. In 1964 he began composition studies with Alexander Goehr and in 1971 he won a Chopin Fellowship to study with Witold Lutosławski in Poland. He also came under the influence of Michael Tippett, who remained a close friend and mentor. Early recognition came with the 1975 BBC Proms commission Leviathan for large orchestra, and this was followed by a string of festival commissions and recordings. Major works from this period include Gesangbuch (1975-6), the Piano Concerto (1976-7) and Concerto for Orchestra (1982), as well as the opera Commedia (1976-7). In 1983, Cowie was awarded the first Granada Composer Fellowship with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. He remained with the orchestra for three years and worked with them as both composer and conductor. He subsequently worked as a conductor with several major orchestras and ensembles in Britain and Australia. Among works from this time are the Clarinet Concerto (1978), Choral Symphony (1983), Atlas (1986), Cello Concerto (1993, revised 2003) and several pieces inspired by the Australian folk-hero Ned Kelly. After twelve years in Australia he returned to England to live in 1995. Music Cowie's appointment as the first Composer in Association with the BBC Singers (2002-6) saw the completion of some of his most complex and inventive scores, including Gaia (2002), an hour-long creation epic inspired by the writings of James Lovelock and National Portraits, shortlisted for the 2007 British Composer, Radio 3 Listeners' Award. In May 2010 the third part (Spring) of Four Seasons for a cappella choir, a joint commission by CC21 in London and Commotio in Oxford, received its premiere. The conductor, Howard Williams, has premiered many of Cowie's works. His 24 Preludes were released on UHR Label in 2008 to critical acclaim. This was followed by the release of his Magma Psalm for Harp and Wind Quartet on NMC label in March, 2010. His Rutherford's Lights, a massive cycle of 24 pieces for solo piano has just been recorded on UHR label with Richard Casey as the pianist and was released in the early autumn, 2010. It was described as 'an epic achievement' in International Piano Magazine in February 2010. The Rutherford cycle was followed by his 'Particle Partita for solo Violin', a set of 8 sort pieces that trace the time-line in the history of particle physics. Collaborating first with physicist Sir Michael Berry FRS on the Rutherford Cycle, the Particle Partita was a collaboration between Cowie and particle physicist Professor Brian Foster FRS of Oxford University and CERN. A new collaboration has begun with Sir Michael Berry on an Oboe Quintet, 'The Colours of Dark Light', and will be premiered in the 2013/14 season with the Coull Quartet and Christopher Redgate.2013 saw celebrations of Cowie's 70th birthday with a BBC Prom commission, 'Earth Music 1' premiered by the BBC Philharmonic under Noseda. There was also a Proms Portrait Concert in the RCM and a special birthday-tribute concert given for him by the BBC Singers. The new Signum Classics release of Cowie's 'Gesangbuch' and other choral/instrumental works was received with critical acclaim as was Earth Music 1. The Kreutzer Quartet released the first in a series of recordings of Cowie's String Quartets, the first being quartets 3-5 and on the NMC Label.

Bach, Haydn, Janáček, Debussy, Sibelius and Messiaen. His mature style combines elements of impressionism with intricate part-writing, intense lyrical expressiveness, tonal fluidity and rhythmic complexity. Cowie acknowledges these earlier influences whilst at the same time stressing a continued journey of exploration of new musical forms, especially those that can be discovered by a fusion of music with structural and behavioural materials derived from and inspired by both the natural sciences and physics. In recent times, Cowie has increasingly turned to acts of drawing and painting, in an addition to theoretical research, as primers for his music. Not having composed for orchestra for several years, he has also commenced the first of a large set of short works for large orchestra, called 'Earth Music'. He feels that the lengthy and weighty dialectic approach to earlier large-scale orchestral works, should now give way to a form of synthesis and compression, where the sensation of the music is intensified by brevity. Returning to writing for large orchestral forces in 2012, Cowie has commenced a major series of short orchestral works, none lasting more than 9'. This cycle, to be titled 'Earth Music' will open with a BBC Prom Commission for 2013 (the composer's 70th birthday year). Cowie has stated that I want to work with brevity in time but with great concentration and event. I have come to realise that some of our most intense experiences of (for example), the natural world, last for something around a minute or less in their most dynamic form. In removing myself from some previously practised lengthy dialectical formalism, I am going to try to engage with synthesis and compression in order to increase the sensual impact of the music. Painting and writing Alongside his rise to prominence as a musician, Cowie has exhibited internationally as a painter, and his works are in public and private collections in more than 20 countries. He has also made several television films, including his acclaimed BBC2 film on Leonardo, of 1986. In 1988 and 1989, he wrote and presented two major radio series commissioned by ABCFM, Australia. In 2002 he was created the first Artist in Residence with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. In that same year, he became the first Composer in Association with the BBC Singers in London; a collaboration that spawned three major new works in the genre. During the late 1990s, he worked as an author of books on wildlife and the first in a major series, Birds Talk, was published in 2001. During 2012, Cowie has commenced a major series of oil paintings on a large scale, both being a series devoted to water, the second set especially focussing on The Great Barrier Reef and which will form the structural framework for the first in his new series of orchestral works, 'Earth Music'. In 2014, Cowie returned to Radio Broadcasting with a commission from ABC Radio National, Australia with a commission to present a programme on the relationships between drawing and music. 'Drawing towards Music'. As a result of its broadcast in May 2014, he is to write and present further programmes for ABC Radio National in 2015. ‘The Singing Planet’, a two part series about the natural history of song, was broadcast on ABC Earshot in 2015.

Restored by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s, it now lies in a rather incongruous position as U.S. Route 85 splits to run either side of the building. History Colorado (then the Colorado Historical Society) took possession of the property in 1958 and runs it as a museum to display exhibits of the fur-trade era. History left After building a temporary trading post called Fort Convenience on the South Platte River and Clear Creek in 1834, Vasquez established Fort Vacquez with Sublette. The present day Fort Vasquez located, literally, on Highway 85, next to Platteville, Colorado is a reconstruction of the adobe trading post established by the trappers Louis Vasquez and Andrew Sublette. They built the fort in 1835 after obtaining a trading license in St. Louis, Missouri, from William Clark, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs. thumb They traded with other furriers, trappers, mountain men, and Native American tribes (including the Arapaho and Cheyenne), amidst competition with other trading posts. Unable to turn a profit, they sold Fort Vasquez to Lock and Randolph in 1840 who subsequently went bankrupt and abandoned the structures in 1842. Due to the bankruptcy, Vasquez and Sublette could not collect the sum owed to them for the sale. The Census of 1880 lists several residents of Vasquez Fork, and it appears to be a mining community. One resident was Othello Reed Ostrander, born 1843 in New York. The census taker lists him as being in Vasquez Fork AND living in Georgetown with his wife and two young sons. He was listed twice. His wife was Isabelle Irene and sons were Arthur and Albert. The fort was almost demolished during the construction of US Route 85. It was saved, in part, due to the efforts of local resident Fern Miller, who would later become Superintendent of the Denver Mint.

Almost no information survives about his life, and only three of his works are known. A certain \\"Johannes Ecghaerd\\", who held chaplaincies in Bruges and Diksmuide, may be a possible match for Egardus. The extant works—a canon and two Glorias—appear to be less complex than music by mid-century composers, possibly because they date from either very early or very late in Egardus' career. Biography A 1735 engraving of St Donatian's Cathedral in Bruges as it appeared about 270 years after Johannes Ecghaerd was appointed succentor in 1370 Little is known with certainty about his life. The enigma of his biography stems from a difficulty in knowing whether he was Flemish or Italian. A northern origin is suggested by his name, a copy of one of his works in a Flemish manuscript, and a possible citation of his music by Thomas Fabri. But with only one other exception, all of his works are found in Northern Italian manuscripts, and that exception, a Polish manuscript, has strong Italian connections.Cuthbert, pp. 170–71. The most important biographical research on the composer was conducted by , who notes that it was more common for Northern works (and composers) to travel to Italy than the opposite.Strohm, p. 43 Strohm identifies a \\"Magister Johannes Ecghaerd\\" appointed as succentor of St Donatian's Cathedral (Sint-Donaaskathedraal) in Bruges in 1370 as a possible match for the composer. This appointment suggests to Strohm that Echgaerd would have been born by or before 1340.Strohm, pp. 44–45. Strohm also finds connections to a work by Thomas Fabri, a Dutch composer, in the text of Furnos reliquisti, an unlikely coincidence if they were not working in close proximity to each other. Johannes Egardus held chaplaincies in Diksmuide and Bruges.Acta Capitularia Sint-Donaas, Bisschoppelijk Archief Brugge, Reeks A no. 48: 26.3.1371; 21.5.1371; 22.5.1387; A no. 49 (1394-) f. 1r; cited in Strohm, p. 45 The number of his pieces in Paduan manuscripts suggested to Strohm that he may have been resident there.Strohm, p. 44 Nino Pirrotta had suggested that he may have been one of the musicians in the papal court of Bologna c.1410.Pirrotta, Nino, p. 43. However, Pirrotta's evidence was based on the position of Egardus's works within the manuscript Mod A—a connection between manuscript and court now considered more tenuous,Stone, Anne. and not from the lists of singers in the Italian papal chapels: lists from which Egardus is absent.Di Bacco and Nádas, foldout 1. Works Only three works by Egardus survive. A canon, Furnos reliquisti quare; Equum est et salutare is found in a single source, Mod A (Modena, Biblioteca Estense e Universitaria alpha.M.5.24). His other two works have a somewhat wider distribution. The Gloria with the trope \\"Spiritus et Alme\\" appears in three sources, Utrecht, Universiteitsbibliotheek 1846 (olim 37, independently discovered by Schmid and Strohm) and two sources from Padua, Biblioteca Universitaria: MSS Ba 2.2.a (formerly 1225, part of Pad D) and 1475 (part of Pad A). Both of the Paduan sources originally come from the Paduan abbey of Santa Giustina. An untroped Gloria appears in five independent sources: Warsaw, Biblioteka Narodowa, MS III.8054 (olim Biblioteka Krasiński 52, commonly called Kras.) f. 204v-205r, Mod A f. 21v-22r, a collection of sources in Grottaferrata and at Dartmouth College (f.

Overview  Near-field electromagnetic ranging is an emerging RTLS technology that employs transmitter tags and one or more receiving units. Operating within a half-wavelength of a receiver, transmitter tags must use relatively low frequencies (less than 30 MHz) to achieve significant ranging. Depending on the choice of frequency, NFER has the potential for range resolution of and ranges up to .  Technical Discussion  The phase relations between the EH components of an electro-magnetic field ((E and H are the components E=electric and H=magnetic)) vary with distance around small antennas. This was first discovered by Heinrich Hertz and is formulated with Maxwell's field theory. Close to a small antenna, the electric and magnetic field components of a radio wave are 90 degrees out of phase. As the distance from the antenna increases, the EH phase difference decreases. Far from a small antenna in the far-field, the EH phase difference goes to zero. Thus a receiver that can separately measure the electric and magnetic field components of a near-field signal and compare their phases can measure the range to the transmitter. = Advantages = NFER technology is a different approach for locating systems. It has several inherent advantages over other RTLS systems. * First, no signal modulation is required, so baseband signals with an arbitrarily small bandwidth may be used for ranging. * Second, precise synchronization is not required between different receivers: in fact, a local range measurement can be made with just a single receiver. * Third, since EH phase differences are preserved when a signal is down- converted to baseband, high range precision may be achieved with relatively low time precision. For instance, a radio wave at 1 MHz has a period of 1 µs, and the EH phase difference changes about 45 degrees between to . Thus, a 1 degree EH phase difference in a 1 MHz signal corresponds to a range difference of about and 1/360 of the period or 27.78 ns difference in time between the electric and magnetic signals. Down-converted to a 1 kHz audio signal, the period becomes 1 ms, and the time difference required to measure becomes 27.78 µs. A comparable time-of-flight (TOF) or Time difference of arrival (TDOA) system would require 2 ns to 4 ns to make the same measurement. Using relatively low frequencies also conveys additional advantages. First, low frequencies are generally more penetrating than higher frequencies. For instance, at 2.4 GHz a reinforced concrete wall might attenuate signals as much as 20 dB. Second, the long wavelengths associated with low frequencies are far less vulnerable to multipath. In dense metallic structures, multipath obscures or destroys the ability of microwave or UHF signals to be used for reliable positioning. Low frequencies are less affected by this problem. = Disadvantages = Operation at low frequencies faces challenges as well. In general, antennas are most efficient at frequencies whose wavelengths are comparable to the antennas' dimensions (e.g., a quarter-wavelength monopole antenna). Therefore, since higher frequencies have smaller wavelengths, high frequency antennas are typically smaller than low frequency antennas. The larger size of practically efficient low frequency antennas is a significant hurdle that near-field electromagnetic ranging systems cannot overcome without decreasing gain. Applying fractal antennae to NFC requires complex adaptive controls  Applications  The low-frequency, multipath-resistant characteristics of NFER make it well suited for tracking in dense metallic locations, such as typical office and industrial environments. Low frequencies also readily diffract around the human body, which makes tracking people possible without the body blockage experienced by microwave systems like Ultra-wideband (UWB). Systems deployed in complicated indoor propagation environments reportedly achieve accuracy or better at ranges of or more. There is also an indication that multiple frequency implementations may yield increased accuracy.

At high, it is the tallest building in Arkansas.Metropolitan Tower Emporis.com, accessed January 15, 2008 Construction left The new tower was born out of discussions between two ascending business executives, John Flake, a Little Rock real estate developer, and Jerry Maulden, president of Arkansas Power & Light (now Entergy). Construction began in 1984 on the $72 million building, and in 1986 the building was completed and dubbed The Capitol Tower. Currently, the namesake tenant, Simmons Bank, is headquartered in the tower with presence in various markets of Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, and Tennessee. Kelley Commercial Partners, the current name of the development firm of the tower, performs the management and leasing of the tower, and the Doyle Rogers Company is the special asset manager. The building was renamed Simmons Tower in April 2014. History Once finished in 1986, the building was opened and named Capitol Tower. Upon completion it became the tallest building in Arkansas, taking the record by 92 feet (28 m) from its neighbor the Regions Center (formerly First National Bank Building) located across the street. The tower has held this record ever since. Little Rock–founded international frozen yogurt chain TCBY moved into the tower and gained naming rights in 1991 and the building became known as TCBY Tower. TCBY would later move out of the tower after the company was sold in 2000, leaving the three floors they occupied vacant. The name was changed again in August 2004 when Metropolitan National Bank bought naming rights to the tower and moved its headquarters in the building, and it was renamed Metropolitan Tower. Metropolitan Bank added exterior lighting to the facade of the tower in 2005 which includes 400-watt flood lights that illuminate the sides of the tower along with LED lights that can be programmed to any color and are used to commemorate national holidays. Simmons Bank purchased Metropolitan National Bank in 2014 and renamed the tower. The building has a 952-car parking garage across the street with a connecting skywalk to the tower lobby. Simmons Tower has 17 elevators and is equipped with antennas and satellite dishes on the roof that are used for radio and cell phone communication as well as by local network affiliates. Timothy McVeigh scouted out the building as a possible bombing location prior to bombing the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City. He would decide against bombing the building due to the presence of a florist's shop on the ground floor at the time.

Its headquarters was in Wilton, Connecticut. GameWeek was the leading trade publication of its time, and to this day remains the last printed trade publication which served the North American market.  History  It was published initially under the name Video Game Advisor (VGA) beginning in 1995 and changed names twice, to GameWeek, as it is best known, and later to Interactive Entertainment. \\"Interactive entertainment\\" was a phrase that is attributed to the magazine, but became part of the industry's vernacular and was popularized by Hal Halpin, founder and publisher – representing the convergence of the console, online and computer games sectors. File:Ie magazine jpg.png GameWeek was a glossy tabloid-sized newspaper-style magazine which included interviews with the game industry’s leading personalities, feature stories on the latest trends and reviews and previews of products from a salability perspective (as opposed to enthusiast media, which covered games from their playability or fun-factor). A significant portion of the magazine’s advertising revenue came from game publisher ads promoting upcoming titles to the leading retail buyers – who comprised the bulk of the 63,000 subscribers. The publication went largely unopposed throughout its history, largely due to spawning several ancillary products which covered market niches, including GameDaily (a daily electronic newsletter and website), GameJobs (a job site and board), Official E3 Show Daily, and a re-publishing of Game Over: Press Start to Continue (the authoritative novel chronicling the industry). Several magazines did attempt to unseat the publication’s prominence including MCV. GameWeek ran from January 1995 until January 2002, at which point its publishing company was forced to close due to mounting accounts receivable attributable primarily to a post 9/11 decline in advertising spending. Of the three major magazines, only MCV has survived and although UK-focused, it is seen by many as the only trade publication available that is relevant to the US market.  Current state  When Cyberactive Media Group folded, the magazine ceased print and moved its only remaining asset, its name, online.

Background Rumsey was born to Dr. Edward Rumsey in Botetourt County, Virginia. When the younger Rumsey was still a child, Dr. Rumsey moved the family to Christian County, Kentucky. Studying under Daniel Barry, he completed preparatory studies in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. He studied law under John J. Crittenden, with whom he became lifelong friends. He moved to Greenville, Kentucky where he was admitted to the bar and practiced in Muhlenberg and surrounding counties. Biography Rumsey was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1822. The major questions during his tenure were those connected to the Old Court-New Court controversy. On January 5, 1832, Rumsey married Jane Merrihew Wing. The couple had two children. Rumsey was elected as a Whig to the Twenty-fifth Congress, serving from March 4, 1837 to March 3, 1839. On February 9, 1839, he gave an impassioned speech on the House floor regarding a resolution to recognize his uncle, James Rumsey, as the inventor of the steamboat and to present a gold medal to his cousin, his uncle's only child. The resolution unanimously passed the House, but failed in the Senate. In spring 1838, both Rumsey's young children contracted scarlet fever and died. Overwhelmed with sorrow, he retired from public life at the end of his congressional term. After leaving Congress, he again resumed the practice of his profession. He died in Greenville, Kentucky in 1868 and was buried in the Old Caney Station Cemetery, near Greenville, Kentucky. Honours According to historian Otto Rothert, the town of Rumsey in McLean County, Kentucky was to be named after Edward Rumsey. Out of modesty, Rumsey declined, after which the citizens agreed to a compromise whereby the town would be called Rumsey and officially be named in honor of James Rumsey.

Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 67 with New Book of Tang, vol. 93. The Zizhi Tongjian, while not explicitly stating that Li Shiji was 75 at the time of his death, appeared to follow the Old Book of Tang by quoting Li Shiji as stating that he was satisfied with living almost to 80. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 201. (The New Book of Tang, containing apparently the same quote, had a slightly different version that had Li Shiji stating that he was satisfied with living over 80.) – December 31, 669), courtesy name Maogong, posthumously known as Duke Zhenwu of Ying, was a Chinese general who lived in the early Tang dynasty. His original family name was Xú, but he was later given the family name of the Tang imperial clan, Li, by Emperor Gaozu, the Tang dynasty's founding emperor. Later, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong, Li Shiji was known as Li Ji (i.e. the \\"Shi\\" in his name was omitted) to avoid naming taboo because the personal name of Emperor Gaozong's predecessor, Emperor Taizong (Li Shimin), had the same Chinese character \\"Shi\\". Li Shiji is also referred to as Xu Maogong (his original family name and his courtesy name combined) and Xu Ji in the historical novels Shuo Tang and Sui Tang Yanyi. Li Shiji was initially a follower of Li Mi, one of the rebel rulers rebelling against the preceding Sui dynasty, and he submitted to the Tang Empire after Li Mi did so, upon which Emperor Gaozu, impressed with his loyalty to Li Mi, granted him the family name \\"Li\\". He later participated in destroying Xu Yuanlang and Fu Gongshi, two of the Tang Empire's competitors in the campaign to reunify China. During the reign of Emperor Gaozu's son and successor, Emperor Taizong, Li Shiji participated in the successful campaigns against the Göktürks and Xueyantuo, allowing the Tang Empire to become the dominant power in eastern Asia, and also served as a chancellor. During the reign of Emperor Gaozong, he served as chancellor and the commander of the army against Goguryeo, destroying Goguryeo in 668. He died the next year. He and Li Jing were considered the two most prominent early Tang generals.Old Book of Tang, vol. 67.New Book of Tang, vol. 93. Early life Xu Shiji was probably born in 594. His clan was originally from Cao Province (, roughly modern Heze, Shandong), but late in Sui Dynasty moved to Hua Province (, roughly modern Anyang, Henan). Xu Shiji's father Xu Gai () was a member of the landed gentry, and both he and Xu Shiji were said to be generous, using the food yields of their land to help others regardless of whether those were related to them. Service under Zhai Rang and Li Mi Around 616, Zhai Rang gathered a group of men to resist the rule of Emperor Yang. Xu Shiji joined Zhai,Old Book of Tang, vol. 67 indicates that Xu Shiji was 16 at the time he joined Zhai, but this conflicts with all other records on his birth date. While Zhai's uprising was not firmly dated in historical records, it was said to be at the end of Emperor Yang's Daye era (605–618), and if Xu Shiji was 16 in 610, it would not be at the end of the Daye era. Indeed, in 610, there would have been very few reasons for people to resist Emperor Yang's rule, as that would predate his disastrous campaigns against Goguryeo. and suggested to him that instead of pillaging the people of the region, which Zhai had done to maintain himself and his own men, it was inappropriate to be robbing people of their homeland. Rather, he suggested that, as there were plenty of travellers on the Grand Canal, that they should rob travellers instead. Zhai agreed, and their pillaging raids instead targeted travellers and official messengers. Many people joined Zhai, and when the key Sui general Zhang Xutuo (), who had defeated many agrarian rebels, attacked, Xu killed Zhang in battle late in 616, allowing Zhai to become even more acclaimed. Around this time, he also became close friends with another general under Zhai, Shan Xiongxin (), swearing to be brothers and to die on the same day. Meanwhile, Li Mi, the strategist for the Sui general Yang Xuangan, who unsuccessfully rebelled against Emperor Yang in 613, was visiting rebel generals in the region, seeking to sell his grand strategy to destroy Sui. As Li Mi was of noble birth, and there had been prophecies that the next emperor would be named Li, there began to be thoughts among the rebels that Li might be destined to be the next emperor. Xu Shiji and another close associate of Zhai's, Wang Bodang (), thus persuaded Zhai to support Li Mi as leader. Zhai agreed, and after the victory over Zhang, the rebels approached the eastern capital Luoyang and declared Li Mi their leader, with the title of Duke of Wei. Xu was given a major general title, while Zhai served as prime minister. After Xu achieved a victory over the Sui general Wang Shichong, whom Emperor Yang had sent to reinforce Luoyang, Li Mi created Xu the Duke of Donghai. At Xu's suggestion, Li Mi captured a major food storage—Liyang Storage (, in modern Hebi, Henan) -- and after doing so, opened up the storage to allow people in the region suffering from famines to take food. As a result, more than 200,000 men joined Li Mi within about 10 days, and a number of commanderies submitted to him, including the major rebel generals Dou Jiande and Zhu Can. In winter 617, with a conflict between Li Mi and Zhai intensifying, Li Mi set an ambush for Zhai at a feast held for him, killing him, his brother Zhai Hong (), his nephew Zhai Mohou (), and his strategist Wang Ruxin (). During the ambush, Xu was injured in his neck and nearly died. Li Mi, declared, however, that his intention was only to execute Zhai Rang, and no one other than the Zhai clan was to worry. He personally attended to Xu's injuries, and had Xu, Shan, and Wang Bodang take over Zhai's troops. In spring 618, Emperor Yang was killed at Jiangdu (in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) in a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji. Yuwen soon abandoned Jiangdu and headed back north, toward Luoyang, with the elite Xiaoguo Army (), leading to comprehension both at Luoyang (where Sui officials had declared Emperor Yang's grandson Yang Tong the Prince of Yue emperor) and at Li Mi's headquarters. The enemies made peace, with Li Mi nominally submitting to Yang Tong, as both sides prepared for a joint confrontation with Yuwen. As part of this arrangement, Xu also received a major Sui general title. Li Mi, who had become somewhat alienated with Xu due to Xu's criticism that he was not sufficiently rewarding the soldiers, put Xu in charge of defending Liyang Storage, and Yuwen subsequently put Liyang under siege, but Xu was not only able to withstand the siege but further fought Yuwen outside, defeating him. Later in 618, Wang Shichong, who had opposed the peace agreement with Li Mi, killed the other key officials Lu Chu () and Yuan Wendu (), who had advocated peace with Li Mi. Another official who supported the peace, Huangfu Wuyi (), fled to Chang'an and surrendered to the newly established Tang Dynasty. Wang seized power as regent. Hearing what had happened, Li Mi broke off peaceful relations with Yang Tong's regime. However, he did not pay close attention to Wang, and Wang soon defeated him in a surprise attack, seizing most of his troops. Initially, after the defeat, Li Mi considered fleeing to Xu, at Liyang, but was warned by some that Xu had nearly died when he killed Zhai and thus could not be trusted. Instead, Li Mi fled to Chang'an and surrendered to Tang. Xu, upon hearing that Li Mi had fled to Chang'an, took effective control of Li Mi's former territory, and as Li Mi had surrendered to Tang, he decided to submit to Tang as well, but stated to his secretary Guo Xiaoke (): He therefore sent Guo to Chang'an to report to Li Mi. Emperor Gaozu of Tang heard that Xu had sent messengers, but with no petitions to submit to Tang, only reports for Li Mi, and was surprised. He summoned Guo and questioned him, and Guo relayed what Xu's intents were. Emperor Gaozu was impressed and stated, \\"Xu Shiji remembers his lord and surrenders his accomplishments, and is really a pure-hearted subject.\\" He thus bestowed the imperial clan name of Li (which he shared with Li Mi) on Xu, who thereafter would be known as Li Shiji. He also created Li Shiji the Duke of Cao and his father Xu Gai (thereafter known as Li Gai as well) the Prince of Jiyin, although Li Gai declined the honor and was subsequently created the Duke of Shu. Li Shiji remained in charge of the Liyang region to resist against Wang and Dou Jiande.  During Emperor Gaozu's reign  Around the new year 619, Li Mi, wanting to revive his independence, rebelled against Tang but was soon killed by the Tang general Sheng Yanshi (). Emperor Gaozu sent messengers to Li Shiji explaining why Li Mi was killed. Li Shiji mourned Li Mi and requested that he be allowed to bury Li Mi with honor. Emperor Gaozu agreed and sent Li Mi's body to Li Shiji. Li Shiji, still using ceremonies due a ruler, buried Li Mi in a grand funeral south of Liyang. In fall 619, Dou Jiande, then with the title of Prince of Xia, launched a major offensive, set to affirm his control of the territory north of the Yellow River, as a number of cities there had submitted to Tang. After a number of Xia victories, Li Shentong () the Prince of Huai'an, Emperor Gaozu's cousin who was in charge of Tang operations north of the Yellow River, withdrew to Liyang and joined forces with Li Shiji. When Dou then was on the way to attack Tang's Wei Prefecture (, roughly modern Weihui, Henan), Li Shiji tried to ambush him, and his officer Qiu Xiaogang () nearly killed Dou before Dou's guards killed him. In anger, Dou turned his attack around and attacked Liyang instead, capturing it and seizing Li Shentong, Li Gai, Wei Zheng, and Emperor Gaozu's sister Princess Tong'an. Li Shiji was able to fight his way out, but several days later, because his father Li Gai had been captured, surrendered to Dou. Dou made Li Shiji a general and still kept him in charge of Liyang, but took Li Gai back to the Xia capital Ming Prefecture (, in modern Handan, Hebei) to serve as a hostage. He also put Li Shentong under house arrest, as an honored guest. Li Shiji soon considered how he could again submit to Tang, but worried that Dou would kill his father Li Gai. Guo Xiaoke suggested to him that he needed to first gain Dou's trust by accomplishing things for Xia. Li Shiji agreed, and in winter 619, he attacked the city of Huojia (in modern Xinxiang, Henan), held by Wang Shichong (who had by that point had Yang Tong yield the throne to him, ending Sui and establishing a new state of Zheng) and captured much goods and persons to present to Dou, including Dou's childhood friend Liu Heita.Whether Li Shiji captured Liu Heita, however, was disputed among traditional historians, although the majority view was that he did. See Liu's article for more details. Dou began to trust him. Li Shiji then suggested to Dou that he should attack the agrarian leader Meng Haigong (), who was then nominally submitting to Zheng, arguing that if Xia could first capture Meng's holdings, it could then next have designs on Zheng. Dou agreed, and he sent his brother-in-law Cao Dan () south across the Yellow River, joining forces with Li Shiji. Dou himself would follow, and Li Shiji planned that, as soon as Dou himself arrived, he would ambush Dou's camp and kill him, and then try to find and save his father Li Gai. However, at this time, Dou was awaiting his wife Empress Cao's giving birth and did not arrive for a while. Meanwhile, Cao Dan was insulting and pillaging the other rebel leaders south of the Yellow River who had submitted to Xia, and the rebel leaders were all resentful. One of them, Li Shanghu (), and Li Shanghu's mother Lady Huo, urged Li Shiji to carry out his plan as soon as possible, and when Li Shiji hesitated, Li Shanghu and Lady Huo acted on their own, ambushing Cao Dan, but while they killed many of Cao's generals, Cao himself was not harmed and soon prepared to counterattack. Li Shanghu notified Li Shiji and asked him to attack Cao, but Li Shiji, saw that Cao had already taken precautions, fled to Tang territory with Guo. Cao soon defeated and killed Li Shanghu, but when Dou's officials suggested that Li Gai be executed, Dou remarked, \\"Li Shiji was a Tang subject. He was captured by us, but still remembered his former lord and was faithful. What sin did his father have?\\" Dou then spared Li Gai. In spring 620, Li Shiji served under Emperor Gaozu's son Li Shimin the Prince of Qin in resisting a major offensive by Liu Wuzhou the Dingyang Khan, and in an engagement against Liu's general Song Jin'gang (), Li Shiji was unsuccessful, but was saved by Li Shimin. (Li Shimin eventually defeated Liu, forcing Liu to flee to Eastern Tujue.) In winter 620, with Li Shimin having launched a major offensive against Wang's Zheng state, the Zheng general Yang Qing (, a Sui imperial prince) surrendered Guan Prefecture (, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan), and Li Shimin sent Li Shiji to take over Guan Prefecture. When Wang Shichong's son and crown prince, Wang Xuanying (), heard of this, he headed to Guan from Hulao, but Li Shiji repelled him, and then had Guo write a letter to Wei Lu (), Zheng's prefect of Ying Prefecture (, also in modern Zhengzhou), to persuade Wei to surrender. Wei did so, and this eventually led to a chain reaction where Zheng's holdings in modern eastern Henan surrendered one by one. Wang Xuanying, in fear, fled back to the Zheng capital Luoyang. Further, in spring 621, Wang Shichong's officer Shen Yue () surrendered to Li Shiji, allowing Li Shiji's subordinate general Wang Junkuo () to capture Hulao and capture Wang Shichong's nephew, Wang Xingben () the Prince of Jing. Soon, however, with Zheng in desperate straits, Wang sought aid from Dou. Dou, believing that if Tang destroyed Zheng that his own Xia state would be cornered, agreed, and he sent his forward troops first while proceeding with his main troops later. In the engagement with Dou's forward troops, Li Shimin had Li Shiji, Chen Zhijie (), and Qin Shubao lead the troops, and they were able to defeat Dou's forward troops. Li Shimin then wrote Dou to persuade him to stop aiding Zheng, but Dou did not relent. In summer 621, Li Shimin engaged Dou at the Battle of Hulao, defeating and capturing him. Wang, believing further resistance to be futile, surrendered. Li Shimin spared Wang, but put a number of Zheng officials that he considered treacherous to death. Li Shiji's sworn brother Shan Xiongxin, whom Li Shimin considered treacherous because Shan had turned against Li Mi, was set to be executed as well. Li Shiji begged Li Shimin to spare Shan, arguing that Shan was a capable general who could be useful to Tang and offering to surrender all of his own honors to save Shan from death. Li Shimin refused. When Shan invoked the pledge they made to die on the same day, however, Li Shiji stated to him that he had already offered his body to the service of the state and that the body was no longer his—and that, if he died as well, no one would be around to take care of Shan's wife and children—therefore refused to die as well, but cut off a piece of his leg muscle, cooked it, and had Shan eat it, stating, \\"Let my flesh turn to dust along with you, my brother. By this, I can at least fulfill part of the pledge.\\" Later that year, when Li Shimin returned to Chang'an, and Emperor Gaozu let his troops march in succession in great honor, Li Shiji was one of the 25 generals honored, permitted to wear the same golden armor that Li Shimin was clad in and to offer the captives at Tang's imperial ancestral temple. He was also united with his father Li Gai, who managed to survive the collapse of the Xia regime and return to Tang territory. Xia territory was temporarily taken over by Tang, but in fall 621, Liu Heita rose against Tang, declaring that he was avenging Dou (whom Emperor Gaozu had executed). Liu quickly captured most of former Xia territory, and when Liu approached the former Xia capital Ming Prefecture, Li Shiji, who was then at nearby Zongcheng (), abandoned Zongcheng and entered Ming to assist its defense, but despite that, Liu defeated him and captured Ming, seizing it as his capital and forcing Li Shiji to flee. Li Shiji subsequently served under Li Shimin in attacking Liu, who had by now declared himself the Prince of Handong, in spring 622, and in a battle, Li Shiji's officer Pan Mao () killed Liu's major general Gao Yaxian (), who had persuaded Liu to rise against Tang in the first place. Subsequently, when Liu attacked Li Shiji, Li Shimin tried to come to Li Shiji's aid but was surrounded and nearly captured, being saved only by the heroics of Yuchi Gong. Li Shimin subsequently defeated Liu by flooding Liu's troops with water from the Ming River (flowing through Ming Prefecture), and Liu fled to Eastern Tujue. (Liu would return later that year and again take over former Xia territory, before being decisively defeated by Li Shimin's older brother Li Jiancheng the Crown Prince.) Li Shiji subsequently followed Li Shimin in attacking Liu's ally Xu Yuanlang the Prince of Lu, who controlled the modern central and western Shandong), and after Li Shimin was recalled to Chang'an, he continued the campaign against Xu Yuanlang with Li Shentong and Ren Gui (). By spring 623, Xu was desperate and abandoned his capital Yan Prefecture, in modern Jining, Shandong), and he was killed in flight. Li Shiji took his head and sent it to Emperor Gaozu. Later in 623, the general Fu Gongshi rebelled against Tang at Danyang (, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu) and declared himself the Emperor of Song. Li Shiji participated in the campaign against Fu, commanded by Emperor Gaozu's distant nephew Li Xiaogong the Prince of Zhao Commandery. After Tang forces converged on Danyang and defeated Song forces at Mount Bowang (, in modern Ma'anshan, Anhui), Fu fled, and Li Shiji chased him down and, after he was captured by the gentlemen in the country, delivered him to Danyang, where Li Xiaogong executed him. By 626, Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin were locked in an intense rivalry, and Li Shimin, fearing that Li Jiancheng might be intending to kill him, solicited advice from Li Shiji and another major general, Li Jing, and both refused to speak on the matter, drawing respect from Li Shimin for their unwillingness to be involved in an internecine struggle.This account, generally now accepted, was adopted by the Zizhi Tongjian. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 191. However, the Old Book of Tang gave a different account: that Li Jing and Li Shiji both offered to assist Li Shimin in a coup attempt. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 64. In summer 626, Li Shimin ambushed Li Jiancheng and another brother, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, who supported Li Jiancheng, at Xuanwu Gate and killed them. He then effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to first create him crown prince and then yield the throne to him (as Emperor Taizong).  During Emperor Taizong's reign  The campaign against Tujue in 630 After Emperor Taizong took the throne, he made Li Shiji the commandant at Bing Prefecture (, roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). In 629, when Emperor Taizong launched a major attack against Eastern Tujue's Jiali Khan Ashina Duobi (a.k.a. Jieli Khan or Illig Qaghan), commanded by Li Jing, Li Shiji was one of the major generals under Li Jing's command and was in charge of one of the four prongs of attack. In spring 630, after Li Shiji defeated Eastern Tujue forces at Baidao (, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia) and after Li Jing defeated Ashina Duobi's main forces and forced Ashina Duobi to flee, he met with Li Jing and decided to, despite the fact that Ashina Duobi claimed to then seek peace, attack Ashina Duobi, defeating him again and capturing most of Ashina Duobi's remaining forces. (Ashina Duobi himself fled further and was later captured by forces under the command of Emperor Taizong's cousin Li Daozong the Prince of Rencheng County.) Meanwhile, as Emperor Taizong's son Li Zhi the Prince of Jin was made the nominal commandant of Bing Precture (but did not actually report to Bing), Li Shiji's title became the secretary general of Bing, but he continued to effectively serve as commandant. In 637, as part of Emperor Taizong's scheme to bestow prefectures on his relatives and great generals and officials as their permanent domains, Li Shiji's title was changed to Duke of Ying, and he was given the post of prefect of Qi Prefecture (, roughly modern Huanggang, Hubei), to be inherited by his heirs, but Li Shiji remained at Bing and did not actually report to Qi. Soon, however, with many objections to the system, the strongest of which came from Zhangsun Wuji, Emperor Taizong cancelled the scheme, although Li Shiji's title remained Duke of Ying. In 641, when discussing about Li Shiji, whom historical accounts indicated that the people obeyed without complaints, Emperor Taizong made the comment: in winter 641, Emperor Taizong promoted him to the post of minister of defense. Soon, however, even before Li Shiji could leave for Chang'an, Xueyantuo's Zhenzhu Khan Yi'nan, believing that Emperor Taizong was about to carry out a major sacrifice to the gods of Mount Tai and therefore would not have time for military action, launched a major attack against Tang's vassal, the Qilibi Khan Ashina Simo, whom Emperor Taizong had created the khan of a reestablished Eastern Tujue in 639. Ashina Simo could not resist, and withdrew within the Great Wall to Shuo Prefecture (roughly modern Shuozhou, Shanxi). Emperor Taizong launched armies, commanded by five generals, including Li Shiji, to aid Eastern Tujue. Around the new year 641, Li Shiji engaged Xueyantuo forces, under the command of Yi'nan's son Dadu (), at Nuozhen River (, flowing through modern Baotou, Inner Mongolia), defeating Xueyantuo forces and forcing them to flee. (Based on comments that Li Shiji made in 644 while advocating a campaign against Goguryeo, it appeared that Li Shiji wanted to advance further to try to destroy Xueyantuo, but Emperor Taizong, at the urging of Wei Zheng, ordered him to stop.) Li Shiji subsequently returned to Chang'an to serve as minister of defense. In 643, when Emperor Taizong commissioned the Portraits at Lingyan Pavilion to commemorate the 24 great contributors to Tang rule, Li Shiji's was one of the portraits commissioned. In spring of that year, when Emperor Taizong's son Li You () the Prince of Qi, angry at his secretary general Quan Wanji (), killed Quan and then declared a rebellion, Emperor Taizong sent Li Shiji to attack Li You, although even before Li Shiji's forces arrived, Li You's subordinates captured him. Subsequently, in summer 643, when Li Chengqian the Crown Prince, was revealed to have plotted to overthrow Emperor Taizong, as he was fearful that Emperor Taizong would replace him with his brother Li Tai the Prince of Wei, Emperor Taizong had Li Shiji, along with other key officials Zhangsun Wuji, Fang Xuanling, Xiao Yu, as well as officials in charge of the supreme court, the legislative bureau, and the examination bureau, investigate. They confirmed Li Chengqian's guilt. Emperor Taizong thus deposed Li Chengqian and, believing that Li Tai's machinations were responsible for Li Chengqian's downfall, also demoted Li Tai and exiled them both, creating Li Zhi crown prince instead. Li Shiji was given the additional title as the new crown prince's head of household, and was also given a newly created title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (), which title designated him as a chancellor de facto. Historical accounts indicated that at one point, when Li Shiji was suddenly ill, medical books indicated that ashes from beards could benefit him, and therefore Emperor Taizong cut off his own beard and burned it to mix it with the medicine. After Li Shiji grew better, he bowed to thank Emperor Taizong—so greatly that he bled from his forehead by pounding on the floor—and Emperor Taizong responded, \\"I did so for the empire, not for you. You do not need to thank me.\\" Further, on one occasion, when Li Shiji was attending an imperial feast, Emperor Taizong stated: \\"I am selecting, among the great achievers, one that I can entrust an orphan [(i.e., the Crown Prince)] to, and no one is more suitable than you are. You did not turn your back on Li Mi, and I know that you will not turn your back on me.\\" Li shiji was so thankful that he wept and bit his finger so hard that he bled. Also at that feast, when Li Shiji became drunk and fell asleep, Emperor Taizong took off his own imperial robe to cover Li Shiji. In spring 644, when the Tang emissary to Goguryeo, Xiangli Xuanjiang (), returned from Goguryeo, indicating that the Yeon Gaesomun, the Goguryeo general who then controlled the political scene there, was unwilling to stop his attacks against Silla, then a Tang vassal, Li Shiji advocated an attack against Goguryeo, and Emperor Taizong agreed, despite opposition by other officials, including Chu Suiliang. Emperor Taizong, after several months of preparations, launched a two-pronged attack against Goguryeo in winter 644, with Li Shiji in charge of the land army containing 60,000 soldiers, heading toward Liaodong Peninsula, and with Zhang Liang in charge of the navy numbering 40,000 soldiers, heading directly toward the Goguryeo capital Pyongyang. Emperor Taizong himself trailed them. In spring 645, Li Shiji reached You Prefecture (, roughly modern Beijing), and then headed into Goguryeo territory. Together with Li Daozong, he captured Gaemo (, in modern Fushun, Liaoning), and then put the important city of Liaodong/Yodong (, in modern Liaoyang, Liaoning) under siege. After Emperor Taizong himself arrived, Liaodong fell. Tang forces then continued heading southeast, toward Yalu River, putting Ansi (, in modern Anshan, Liaoning) under siege. When a major Goguryeo army, commanded by the generals Go Yeonsu () and Go Hyezin () arrived, Emperor Taizong had Li Shiji command 15,000 men to serve as decoy, and when Goguryeo forces attacked Li Shiji, Zhangsun Wuji attacked them from behind with 11,000 men, and Li Shiji and Zhangsun, as well as Emperor Taizong himself, defeated Goguryeo forces, forcing their surrender. He then considered directly attacking Pyongyang itself, but Li Shiji believed that if Ansi was not captured first, the general in command of Ansi (a capable general known in Korean popular legends as Yang Manchun, although whether that was his real name is unknown), might attack Tang forces from the rear. Emperor Taizong agreed, and therefore put Ansi under siege again. However, the commander at Ansi was a capable defender, and the resolve of the defenders was strengthened when Li Shiji, in anger, declared that after the fall of the city all residents would be slaughtered. In fall 645, unable to capture Ansi, with food supplies running low, Emperor Taizong ordered a withdrawal, with Li Shiji and Li Daozong serving as rear guard. In 646, with Xueyantuo in internal turmoil due to the cruelty of the Duomi Khan Bazhuo (Yi'nan's son), Emperor Taizong sent Li Daozong to launch a major attack on Xueyantuo, defeating Xueyantuo forces. Bazhuo fled, but was then attacked and killed by Huige, which took over Xueyantuo territory. Xueyantuo's remaining forces supported Yi'nan's nephew Duomozhi as Yitewushi Khan. Duomozhi offered to submit, but Emperor Taizong, fearful that Xueyantuo might recover and create more trouble later on, sent Li Shiji with an army toward Duomozhi's location. Duomozhi surrendered, and Li attacked the remaining forces unwilling to submit, defeating and capturing them. He delivered Duomozhi to Chang'an, where Emperor Taizong made Duomozhi a general. In 647, Emperor Taizong began yearly raids against Goguryeo, intended to weaken Goguryeo's border regions, in preparation for another future major offensive. For the 647 raids, Li Shiji was in charge of the land prong, while Niu Jinda () was in charge of the sea prong. In summer 649, Emperor Taizong was gravely ill (probably from consuming pills given him by alchemists), and he, not fully trusting Li Shiji, stated to Li Zhi: He then demoted Li Shiji to the post of the commandant of Die Prefecture (, roughly modern Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu). Li Shiji, after receiving the order, departed without hesitation. (The modern historian Bo Yang, commenting on this incident, opined that this showed that, down inside, neither Li Shiji nor Emperor Taizong actually trusted each other, as Li Shiji was too capable for Emperor Taizong's liking.Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 47. Another explanation is that the Taizong was playing an age-old trick to test Li Shiji's loyalty. While he's alive, he was able to handle Li Shiji; he was afraid that his son would not be able to do so after his death. He intentionally demoted Li Shiji to test his response. If Li Shiji showed any hesitation or unhappiness, he would have been executed and the new emperor would not have to deal with him. If Li Shiji didn't show any emotion about the demotion, the new emperor can promote him to show he liked him so Li Shiji would be loyal to him. This turned out to be a bad move. Years later when Gaozong tried to make Wu Zetian () his empress against the opposition of most high officials, Li Shiji decisively put the issue in Wu Zetian's favor by saying that's an internal issue of Gaozong.) Nine days later, Emperor Taizong died and was succeeded by Li Zhi (as Emperor Gaozong).  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  Almost immediately after taking the throne, Emperor Gaozong promoted Li Shiji to be the general in charge of Luoyang. (As Emperor Gaozong also, at the same time, declared naming taboo was to be observed as to the characters shi and min (Emperor Taizong, as his name had two common characters, previously only ordered that naming taboo was to be observed against the use of shimin consecutively), thereafter, Li Shiji became known as Li Ji.) Almost as immediately, Emperor Gaozong repromoted him back to the post of chancellor de facto. He then further made him Puye (Executive State Secretary). In winter 650, Li Ji requested to be relieved of the post of Puye. Emperor Gaozong agreed, but had him remain as chancellor de facto. In 653, Emperor Gaozong bestowed the highly honorific title of Sikong (, Minister of Works) on Li Ji, who continued to be chancellor de facto. In 655, with Emperor Gaozong having lost favor in his wife Empress Wang and greatly favoring his concubine Consort Wu, he wanted to depose Empress Wang and create Consort Wu empress. Almost all high level officials opposed—on the account that Consort Wu had previously been a concubine of Emperor Taizong and therefore having her as a wife would be considered incest, and on the account that Empress Wang was from an honored clan while Consort Wu, while herself from a noble family, was not as highly born—with the conspicuous exceptions of Li Ji, Zhangsun Wuji, and Yu Zhining, each of whom was silent, although Zhangsun and Yu showed their disapproval. The opposition from Chu Shuiliang was particularly fervent. However, when Emperor Gaozong summoned Li Ji to ask his opinion, Li Ji responded, \\"This is your family matter, Your Imperial Majesty. Why ask anyone else?\\" Emperor Gaozong therefore deposed Empress Wang and her ally Consort Xiao to commoner rank and created Consort Wu empress instead, having Li Ji serve as the ceremonial emissary. (Later, at Empress Wu's request, Emperor Gaozong further executed the former Empress Wang and Consort Xiao.) Empress Wu soon became dominant at court, installing officials who favored her ascension in chancellor posts and carrying out a near complete purge of the officials who opposed her or showed disapproval, even including Zhangsun (who, as Emperor Gaozong's uncle, was a major advocate for his having been made crown prince), but Li Ji, not having opposed her, escaped such actions. (Li Ji was nominally put in charge of the investigation during false accusations against Zhangsun for treason (brought by Empress Wu's associate Xu Jingzong), but it does not appear that he was actually responsible for Zhangsun's demise.) In 663, Li Ji was in charge of the corruption probe against another associate of Empress Wu's, the chancellor Li Yifu, leading to Li Yifu's removal, although, again, Li Ji's own involvement was not clear. Tang-Goguryeo war. Around new year 667, after Yeon Gaesomun's death and infighting between Yeon's sons Yeon Namsaeng and Yeon Namgeon, leading to Yeon Namsaeng's fleeing to Tang, Emperor Gaozong launched an army, commanded by Li Ji, with Yeon Namsaeng (by this point renamed Cheon Heonseong/Quan Nansheng, as Yeon () was the same character as Emperor Gaozu's name and therefore unusable per naming taboo) serving as his guide. In fall 667, Li Ji first captured Sinseong (, in modern Fushun, Liaoning), and then advanced further. Meanwhile, the generals serving under him, Pang Tongshan (), Gao Kan (), and Xue Rengui, also defeated Yeon Namgeon's forces. However, the fleet commanded by Guo Daifeng (, Guo Xiaoke's son) ran into problems with food supplies, and wanted to seek aid from Li Ji, but was fearful that if his request fell into Goguryeo hands that his weakness would be revealed, so he wrote the request in code, written as a poem, and sent it to Li Ji. Li Ji, initially not understanding that it was code, was angry that Guo was writing poems on the frontline, but his secretary Yuan Wanqing () was able to decode the poem, showing Li Ji the request, so Li Ji sent food supplies to Guo. (Yuan was later, however, exiled when he wrote a declaration against Goguryeo that stated, \\"You do not even know to defend Yalu River!\\" after which Yeon Namgeon responded by stating, \\"I accept your suggestion!\\" and defended Yalu River, not allowing Li Ji to cross.) Only in fall 668 was Li Ji able to cross Yalu River and advance to Pyongyang and put the city under siege. The King Bojang, Yeon Namgeon's younger brother Yeon Namsan, and a number of officials surrendered, but Yeon Namgeon continued fighting. A few days later, though, his general, the Buddhist monk Shin Seong (), opened the city gates and surrendered. Yeon Namgeon tried to commit suicide, but was captured and saved by Tang forces. This was the end of Goguryeo. Later that year, after Li Ji returned to Chang'an, a great procession was held in his honor, and around the new year 669, when Emperor Gaozong offered sacrifices to Heaven, he had Li Ji sacrifice after he did—an extraordinary honor. Later in 669, Li Ji grew ill. Emperor Gaozong summoned all of Li Ji's brothers and sons who were serving outside the capital back to Chang'an to attend to him. Li Ji took only medications given him by Emperor Gaozong and Li Hong the Crown Prince, but otherwise refused medical treatment, stating: One day, Li Ji summoned his younger brother Li Bi () and told Li Bi that he was feeling better that day, and should summon all of his relatives to hold a feast. At the end of the feast, he stated to Li Bi: He spoke no further, and not long after, around the new year 670, he died. He was buried with extraordinary honors near Tang Zhaoling, the tomb of Emperor Taizong; by Emperor Gaozong's orders, his tomb was made into the shape of several great mountains within Eastern Tujue and Xueyantuo territory, to commemorate his victories over them. The tomb now shares a site with Zhaoling Museum. The Song Dynasty historian Sima Guang, in his Zizhi Tongjian, stated: Li Ji's oldest son Li Zhen () predeceased him, so the title of Duke of Ying was inherited by Li Zhen's son Li Jingye. In 684, after Emperor Gaozong's death and after Empress Dowager Wu deposed her third son with Emperor Gaozong, Emperor Zhongzong, replacing him with her fourth son Emperor Ruizong but was posturing toward taking the throne herself, Li Jingye rose in rebellion. In reprisal, Empress Dowager Wu destroyed Li Ji's tomb, posthumously stripped him of his titles, and slaughtered most, but not all, of his descendants. In 705, after Emperor Zhongzong was restored following a coup against his mother (who was then ruling as \\"Emperor\\" of her state of Zhou), Li Ji's tomb and titles were restored. Popular culture Li Shiji is sometimes venerated as a door god in Chinese and Taoist temples, usually in partnership with Wei Zheng. Li Ji is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI by Koei.

He was a lifelong friend of General Andrew Pickens. Anderson, South Carolina, Anderson County, South Carolina, and the ghost town of Andersonville are named for him. Early life He was born on November 15, 1741 in Augusta County, Virginia. His parents were John and Jane Anderson, who had immigrated from Ireland. Marriage and children He married Anne Thompson in 1765. They moved to South Carolina and settled near his friend from Virginia, Andrew Pickens. She died after twenty-five years of marriage. They had five children: * Robert, Jr., married Maria Thomas. * Anne married Dr. William Hunter. * Mary (1766–1810) married Robert Maxwell (1753–1797), a Revolutionary War hero, was appointed as sheriff of the Greenville District. He lived in Greenville County and was killed by an ambush on November 10, 1797 while he was crossing the Saluda River shoals, where Piedmont Mill Dam was later built. His grave is fifteen miles south of Greenville, near Ware Place. * Jane Anderson (b. 12 June 1775) married William Shaw. * Elizabeth married Samuel Maverick. One child was Samuel Maverick. In 1793, Anderson married a second time, to Lydia Maverick, a widow in Pendleton, South Carolina.Marks (1989), p. 6. Her son, Samuel, married Robert's daughter Elizabeth.Marks (1989), p. 9. After the death of his second wife, he married Mrs. Reese. She was the widow of Dr. Thomas Reese, who was the pastor of Old Stone Church. Military service In the American Revolutionary War, he joined the Fifth South Carolina Militia. He became a captain in the regiment commanded by his friend Andrew Pickens when they fought Boyd's Loyalists. Anderson was one of the Patriots who gave their parole to the British as Ninety Six, South Carolina. Many took up arms after the British had disregarded their promises. At the Battle of Cowpens, Anderson was a colonel under Brigadier General Andrew Pickens. Anderson also served under Henry \\"Light Horse Harry\\" Lee. He fought in the Battle of Eutaw Springs in which the British were victorious. Later, his regiment held the line against the British between Augusta, Georgia and Ninety Six. On the western frontier, he fought with Andrew Pickens against the Cherokees. A treaty signed in 1777 ceded most of the Cherokee lands in the present Anderson, Oconee, and Pickens counties. After the war, Anderson was promoted to the rank of general in the state militia. Political career He served in the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1791 to 1794 and from 1801 to 1802 from the Pendleton District. He was an elder of the Old Stone Church. In 1800, he was elector for Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr. He owned in the current Anderson, Oconee, and Pickens Counties including his home, Westville, on the west side of the Seneca River across from Andrew Picken's home, Hopewell. Death and legacy He died at his home on January 9, 1813. A flood prevented his burial at Old Stone Church, and he was buried on his estate. During the construction of Lake Hartwell, his body was reinterred at Old Stone Church. The ghost town of Andersonville, the City of Anderson, and Anderson County were named for him.

It began in Shōnen Ace in December 1994 and ended in November 2014.Timeline (pg 16), Takeda 2002. pg 162 of Fujie 2004. It consists of 14 volumes, each composed of several \\"stages\\" or chapters. It was initially released before the TV series of the same name by Gainax and Tatsunoko Production and was originally intended as a companion adaptation to that of the TV series. History Neon Genesis Evangelion was created after a meeting between Hideaki Anno and King Records. Although the anime series was conceived before the manga, due to production delays the manga was released first, in the third issue of Kadokawa Shoten's Monthly Shōnen Ace on December 26, 1994,Udon 2016, p. 126 to spread public interest in the upcoming TV series while it was still under production. Due to severe production delays, the anime ultimately aired a full 10 months after the manga first appeared in Shōnen Ace. When the series finally appeared on TV in October 1995, Sadamoto's manga storyline had completed what would later become volumes 1 to 3, matching the storyline of episodes 5 and 6 of the TV series. The anime rapidly outpaced the manga, to the point that the chapters comprising volume 4 (which included content corresponding to TV episode 8) were not released until over a year after the TV series had finished airing.Takeda 2002 Despite an ostensible publishing schedule of one \\"stage\\" (chapter) each month in Shōnen Ace, Sadamoto's actual publication schedule was irregular as he divided his time between other projects, releasing a new volume roughly every year and a half. For example, between the publication in Japan of volume 4 and volume 5, two years elapsed. While the manga ran for more than 18 years, only 14 volumes were published. In 2008, it was announced that the Neon Genesis Evangelion manga was approaching its conclusion. In July 2009, it was moved to a new Kadokawa Shoten seinen magazine, Young Ace, where it was published until the February 2010 issue. At that point Sadamoto stopped writing the manga, putting the publication on hiatus in order to work on the latest Rebuild of Evangelion film. The December 2010 issue of Young Ace announced that the manga would resume that winter (early 2011); the April 2011 issue announced the next stage would be published April 4, 2011. On February 12, 2012, half of the 90th Stage was published, telling different events from the ones seen in episode 26 from The End of Evangelion. This was reportedly the final chapter. On May 2, 2012, Kadokawa Shoten announced that the 13th volume of the manga would be released on November 2, 2012, with ANN noting that \\"neither Sadamoto nor Kadokawa has confirmed that the 13th manga volume is still the final one.\\" In April 2013 Kadokawa Shoten announced that the manga would end in two more chapters. The last chapter was published on June 4, 2013, and the 14th and last volume was released on November 20, 2014. Plot =Characters= Sadamoto was the original character designer for the anime with Hideaki Anno as the supervisor. His manga versions of the characters and plot often differ in subtle ways from the TV series by Gainax. ;Shinji Ikari :Shinji Ikari is invited to Tokyo-3 by his father Gendo Ikari to pilot a mecha known as the Evangelion Unit 01. Shinji reluctantly agrees, and despite a rough start he learns to use Unit 01 to protect the city from creatures known as Angels that threaten to destroy mankind. : Unlike in the anime, Shinji's eyes are brown instead of blue. He is also less introverted and expresses himself more, although he is still plagued by self-doubt and hatred for his father. Shinji in the manga is also considerably more aggressive, and develops deep feelings for Rei as well as Asuka. ;Rei Ayanami :Rei Ayanami is the First Child and pilot of Evangelion Unit 00. At the beginning of the series she is an enigmatic figure whose unusual behavior confounds her peers. However, she progressively becomes more involved with the people around her, and is revealed to be a key factor in the events that conclude the storyline. :She is slightly more talkative than in the anime and becomes more connected with the people around her, largely through her interactions with Shinji. The manga shows her thoughts and feelings, and indirectly shows that she is in love with Shinji. ;Asuka Langley Soryu :Asuka Langley Soryu is the Second Child and the pilot of the Evangelion Unit 02. :She is depicted as a blonde in the manga, rather than red-haired. She is not as verbally aggressive toward Shinji and more open about her true feelings. While she still can be difficult to get along with and initially puts on a \\"good girl\\" facade in front of authority figures, she actually does have a more mature, caring and friendly side to her unlike the anime counterpart. She is also much better friends with Shinji. It is when she drops this facade that she begins to truly improve and be more open. Her feelings for Shinji are not quite as easily discovered in the manga, though it is hinted in various chapters that she is attracted to him. She is a test-tube baby of genius parents, her first meeting with Shinji and his friends is different as Asuka acts more childish than in the series, and she is left in a comatose state immediately after being defeated by the Angel Arael. She fights together with Shinji just before Third Impact and they meet again in the final chapter. ;Kaworu Nagisa :Kaworu Nagisa is the Fifth Child, and is eventually revealed to be the seventeenth Angel, Tabris. He is introduced as a replacement pilot for Unit 02 after Asuka Langley Soryu's synchronization ratio falls below usability. :Kaworu is introduced earlier in the manga storyline. He fights the Angel Armisael alongside Rei in Unit 02. Kaworu is portrayed as being ignorant of many aspects of social interaction, creating some comic relief, but is also colder and more of an unsettling presence than in the anime. Because of this, Shinji dislikes and distrusts Kaworu, while Kaworu makes advances toward Shinji and is upset that Shinji does not return his affections. Sadamoto stated this is because Kaworu picks up Rei's emotions, though Sadamoto stated he wrote their relationship as similar to a high school student causing an impression on a younger, middle-school one, not romance. ;Toji Suzuhara :Toji Suzuhara is the Fourth Child. He dislikes Shinji for being indirectly responsible for his sister getting injured, but eventually comes to respect him, and the two become friends. :Toji's English- translated dialogue is heavily accented (due to him being from Osaka), and his hair color is changed. He is more verbally abusive toward Asuka, calling her \\"bitch\\" multiple times. He is killed during volume 6 of the manga series instead of being crippled. Additionally, Shinji is aware that Toji is the pilot of Unit 03 before the battle against Bardiel. ;Ryoji Kaji :Ryoji Kaji appears to be a triple agent, working as the chief inspection officer for NERV (Internal Affairs) while secretly investigating NERV for the Japanese government, and at times seemingly acting as a cat's-paw both for and against Gendo Ikari and SEELE. :He is given more of a back story in the manga; he tells Shinji of his past to motivate Shinji to return to Nerv after the fight against Bardiel in a hidden supply closet. ;Yui Ikari/Unit 01 :Yui Ikari was a student of genetic engineering at Kyoto University, where she met her future husband Gendo. She served as the test subject for the Contact Experiment of Unit 01, but disappeared during testing. Though proclaimed dead, her soul lives on in Unit 01. :In the manga, in addition to the presence of Yui's soul in Unit 01, the Eva's Angelic aspect has its own identity, depicted as the unarmored Eva. This being shows itself to both Shinji and Rei while they are synchronized with the Eva, and it attempts to trap Shinji inside the Eva with itself after the battle with the Angel Zeruel by taking Yui's form and manipulating Shinji's desire for contact with his mother. Rei is able to establish a mental link with this Angelic part of Unit 01 while outside the Eva, and the two acknowledge that they are directly connected to each other. Reception With the success of the anime, the manga has also become a commercial success; the first 10 volumes have sold over 15 million copies, and the 11th volume reached #1 on the Tohan charts, taking the total to over 17 million.\\"Sadamoto designed characters for the legendary anime but was more involved in drawing the manga adaptation of Evangelion, which began its print run in Gekkan Shōnen Esu, a monthly magazine for boys, in February 1995-- before the anime series was launched on TV. As of 2008, the anime series has already receded more than a decade into the past, and two movie versions have come and gone, but the manga series has not ended yet. It still continues, though irregularly, in the same magazine. So far, the manga episodes have been compiled into 11 volumes in Japanese, while San Francisco-based Viz Media has translated 10 of them into English. In Japan, the book form has sold more than 17 million copies in total.\\" from The Daily Yomiuri (Tokyo) March 7, 2008 Friday. \\"Grim, complex 'Evangelion' easier to digest in print form\\"; by Shigefumi Takasuka, Daily Yomiuri Staff Writer, Yomiuri; Pg. 13 In particular, as the manga drew closer to its conclusion, attention surrounding it reached new heights, with the 11th volume staying on top of the Japanese Comic Ranking charts for 4 straight weeks, a remarkable achievement even for a long-running series. It won the 1996 Comicker fan manga poll. Volume 12 opened at #1 on Oricon's manga rankings and has sold over 600,000 copies. As of October 2012, the series has sold over 23 million copies in 15 countries. Unlike it is sometimes assumed, the manga is in fact not the original version of the story, but instead it was created as a supplemental designed to promote the TV series. Sadamoto has also repeatedly stated that the manga is his own individual work and should never be used as reference for anything in the anime.All About Kaworu Nagisa interview with Sadamoto He has also denied links to the Rebuild movies, specifying that the bonus chapter featuring Mari is fanservice. English release Viz claims that its releases of Evangelion were the first releases of an unflipped manga in English. In August 2011, Viz announced that the manga would be serialized at $1 a chapter online and through its Apple apps.

He produced case furniture in a robust Rococo style, ranging from simple veneered bidets to grand commodes that integrated gilt-bronze mounts into the forms of furniture with subtle three-dimensional curves (bombé). From the later 1760s his furniture increasingly shows a conservative compromise with the nascent neoclassical style. The date of Joubert's admission to the corporation des maiîtres ébénistes is missing, along with the early guild archives, but he was already syndic in 1749-50. Much of his furniture was produced before Parisian guild regulations required ébénistes to stamp their production, and pieces intended for the royal Garde-Meuble were exempt from such regulations;Pierre Verlet, Les Ebénistes du XVIII siècle français. however, the minutely-detailed inventory descriptions of the Garde-Meuble de la Couronne and inventory numbers stencilled on surviving furniture have enabled scholars to identify a number of pieces from Joubert's workshop. Francis Watson suggested that Joubert's marriage to a relative of Pierre II Migeon, a favoured cabinet-maker of Mme de Pompadour, may have brought him to her attention and likely through her to court commissions.Watson, The Wrightsman Collection II (New York:Metropolitan Museum of Art) 1966, p. 551. For the Château de Choisy he produced, with the engineer Guérin, the famous table volante that rose through the floor for private suppers. In the decade following 1763 he supplied 2200 pieces of furniture to the court; under the pressure of such a volume of commissions, he was obliged to subcontract even some important pieces of furniture: the roll-top desk he delivered to the comtesse de Provence, 30 December 1773, (Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon) was actually made by Jean Henri Riesener,Pierre Verlet, Objets d'art français de la collection de Calouste Gulbenkian (Lisbon) 1969, no 5. who would succeed him as ébéniste du roi. In the Frick Collection, New York, is a royal commode delivered by Joubert in 1769 but stamped by Roger Vandercruse Lacroix.Theodore Dell, The Frick Collection: 5. Furniture (New York) 1992, pp 334-50. Among his most celebrated pieces are the corner cupboards (encoignures) made in 1755 for Louis XV's Cabinet de Médailles at Versailles (Bibliothèque nationale). Not all the furniture delivered by Joubert received a favourable reception: a bombé commode painted with flowers on a white Vernis Martin ground (now yellowed), with silvered-bronze mounts, delivered 11 January 1755 for Madame Adelaïde at Versailles, was returned to the Garde-Meuble the same day.It was purchased for Versailles in 1965, though the apartment for which it was intended no longer exists, replaced by Louis XVI's library.

History and profile The magazine started as Radio-Electronics Special Projects in 1980. This was nominally a quarterly supplement to Radio-Electronics that had 10 issues from a single 1980 issue to the Spring 1984 issue. The Summer 1984 issue was renamed Hands-On Electronics. It became bi-monthly in January 1986 and monthly in November 1986. The title was changed to Popular Electronics in February 1989 and was published until December 1999. The longtime Radio Electronics editor, Larry Steckler, was the publisher and owner. (Having purchased Gernsback Publications from the Gernsback family.) Julian S. Martin was the editor. The early issues were just a collection of construction projects. By 1984 there were monthly columns on shortwave listening, amateur radio, and computers. After Ziff-Davis changed Popular Electronics to Computers & Electronics, Hands-On Electronics attracted those hobbyist readers.

He was a right-handed second baseman and outfielder over parts of eight seasons (1884–1891) with the Philadelphia Quakers, Indianapolis Hoosiers, Brooklyn Ward's Wonders and Cincinnati Kelly's Killers. He was the National League stolen base champion in 1886 with Philadelphia. For his career, he compiled a .257 batting average, with 278 RBIs, 602 runs scored, and 205 stolen bases. Early life Andrews was born in Painesville, Ohio. His father had been a boat captain on the Great Lakes. Andrews was an alumnus of Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University). He was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. Playing career Andrews played for the Philadelphia Quakers of the NL between 1884 and 1889. In 1886, the first year in which the stolen base was recorded, Andrews led the NL in the category. He married Mary Frances Kirby in 1888; she was friends with the daughters of Harry Wright, who was Andrews' manager in Philadelphia. In August 1889, he was purchased by the NL's Indianapolis Hoosiers. Andrews was involved in the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players, which was the first professional sports players union. The Brotherhood created the Players' League (PL) before the 1890 season; the league tried to compete with the NL as a major baseball league. Andrews played for the PL's Brooklyn Ward's Wonders. Other than John Montgomery Ward (the player who organized the PL), Andrews was the only player to own shares in the team. The league folded after a single season. In 1891, Andrews' last year as a major league player, he participated in the final season of another league, the American Association. Andrews played for the league's Cincinnati Kelly's Killers until the team released him at the end of July. Andrews' release may have been precipitated by difficulties with manager King Kelly. After retirement In January 1892, newspapers reported that Andrews was growing pineapples on his land near the Indian River in Fort Pierce, Florida, and that he had received some baseball contract offers. He was said to be ignoring the contract offers and planning to have 50,000 pineapples ready for the upcoming season. At one point, he was neighbors with Emmett Seery, another college-educated former baseball player who raised pineapples. When the Great Freeze devastated Florida citrus crops in 1895, Andrews returned to baseball, taking up umpiring in the NL. In July 1895, Andrews was recovering from a broken ankle that occurred when he was struck by a batted ball. In 1898, Andrews was credited with authoring a code of rules for NL umpires, but The Wilkes-Barre Record wrote that the credit should have gone to Henry Chadwick. Andrews resigned as an umpire in July 1899. In the late 1890s, when entrepreneur Henry Flagler created two teams of black baseball players to entertain guests at his two hotels in Palm Beach, Florida, he hired Andrews to run the baseball operations. In 1916, he was a traveling business manager for the Boston Braves. Andrews died in West Palm Beach at the age of 75.

Known for supervising the torture of political prisoners, he was nicknamed \\"the Butcher\\" by the detainees. After the 1953 death of Joseph Stalin and arrest of Lavrentiy Beria, Światło traveled to East Germany on official business. While on the Berlin subway with Fejgin, passing through West Berlin, on 5 December 1953, he \\"slipped away\\" and defected to the West. Afterwards he worked for the American Central Intelligence Agency and Radio Free Europe. Światło's written and broadcast denunciations shook the Polish United Workers' Party. This ultimately contributed to post-Stalinist reforms of the Polish security apparatus and to Poland's political liberalisation in the socialist Polish October revolution. Biography Józef Światło was born on 1 January 1915 as Izaak Fleischfarb (also Fleichfarb, Licht, or Lichtstein, sources vary), into a Jewish family in Medyn village near Zbarazh in Galicia (now Ukraine). Józef Światło - biography, photos, documents at Institute of National Remembrance. Retrieved 6 April 2011 In the Second Polish Republic he was first a Zionist and later, a communist activist. He was arrested twice for his illegal activities. Conscripted in 1939, he served in the Polish Army (Polish 6th Infantry Division) during the Polish September Campaign that year. Taken prisoner by the Germans, he escaped, only to be taken prisoner by the Red Army, which invaded East Poland where his family lived and deported east along with hundred thousands of others. It was also in that period that, on 26 April 1943, he married Justyna Światło, taking her more Polish-sounding surname. He eventually joined the Polish Forces in the East (Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division, Berling's Army), becoming a political officer; he was also promoted to junior lieutenant (podporucznik) and became involved in organising state administration in areas taken from the Germans. In 1945, he was transferred to the newly formed Ministry of Public Security of Poland (officially MBP, but commonly abbreviated to UB). In his work, Światło, like many other communist secret police agents, used torture and forgery. He was involved in arresting hundreds of members of Polish underground organization, Armia Krajowa, its leadership (the Trial of the Sixteen) and falsifying of the 1946 Polish referendum. In time he was promoted to Lieutenant colonel (pol.Podpułkownik) and served in various offices and departments, eventually in 1951 ending up in the 10th Department, where he was one of the leading officers. The 10th Department was responsible for handling the Party members themselves. He received orders personally from the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party Bolesław Bierut, and arrested such notable people as politicians Władysław Gomułka and Marian Spychalski, General Michał Rola- Żymierski and Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński. He had access - sometimes unique - to many secret documents. He interrogated Noel Field on 27 August 1949 in Budapest as well as his brother, Herman Field (a US citizen who went to Poland to look for his brother). Herman would be secretly imprisoned for five years, until the information on him was revealed - by Światło himself. =Defection to the West= In November 1953, the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party Bolesław Bierut asked Politburo member Jakub Berman to send UB Lieutenant Colonel Józef Światło on an important mission to East Berlin. Światło, deputy head of UB's Department X, together with Colonel Anatol Fejgin, were asked to consult with Stasi chief Erich Mielke about eliminating Wanda Brońska. Światło, however, after the death of Stalin in March 1953 and arrest of Lavrentiy Beria in June that year, became afraid for his own life. He suspected that Bierut in Poland might turn on him and other members of the Ministry, attempting to make them into scapegoats. The two officers traveled to Berlin and spoke with Mielke. On 5 December 1953, the day after meeting the Stasi chief, Światło defected to the U.S. military mission in West Berlin. He left family - wife and two children - in Poland. The next day, American military authorities transported Światło to Frankfurt and by Christmas Światło had been flown to Washington, D.C., where he underwent an extensive debriefing. It has been reported that his interrogations were compiled into about fifty long reports. The United States gave him political asylum with the full knowledge that \\"he would have to be protected for the rest of his life because the number of his victims and relatives of victims sworn to exact retribution was so great.\\" Aftermath Światło's defection was revealed in Poland by the Polish Press Agency on 25 October 1954, with Światło labelled a traitor and provocateur. It was, however, widely publicised in the United States and Europe by the US authorities, as well as in Poland via Radio Free Europe, embarrassing the Communist authorities in Warsaw - the first international press conference with Światło took place on 28 September 1954. Światło had intimate knowledge of the internal politics of the Polish government, especially the activities of the various secret services. Over the course of the following months, US newspapers and Radio Free Europe (in the \\"Behind the scenes of the secret service and the party\\" cycle) reported extensively on political repression in Poland based on Światło's revelations.Jan Skorzynski, \\"1956 - a european date\\" From Thaw to Restoration: A Chronology . Retrieved 13 April 2007 Capitalising on them, in what was known as \\"Operation Spotlight\\", RFE broadcast some 140 interviews by Światło, and 30 programs on him. Światło's RFE broadcasts were not only serialized but even distributed over Poland by special balloons. Światło detailed the torture of prisoners under interrogation and politically motivated executions and struggles inside the Polish United Workers' Party. Leszek Szymowski, Brawurowa ucieczka najsłynniejszego zbiega, Onet.pl, 26 January 2010. Retrieved 6 April 2011 None of the Polish Communists intelligence, counterintelligence and public security agencies escaped unscathed and without some of their secrets being revealed. The highly publicised defection of Colonel Światło, not to mention the general hatred of the Ministry of Public Security among Poles, led to changes in late 1954, as first the 10th Department and soon afterwards, the entire Ministry, was broken up and reorganised; many officials were arrested.Paweł Machcewicz, \\"Social Protest and Political Crisis in 1956\\", which appears on pp. 99-118 of Stalinism in Poland, 1944-1956, ed. and tr. by A. Kemp-Welch, St. Martin's Press, New York, 1999, . Światło's scandal contributed to the events of political liberalisation in Poland, known as the Polish October. For a long time, it was uncertain if Światło was dead or still alive. Piotr Zychowicz, Poszukiwany Józef Światło, Rzeczpospolita, 18 December 2008. Retrieved 6 April 2011 Information on him was protected by the US witness protection program; there were rumours that he died in the late 1960s, 1975 or 1985.

Its title is drawn from Greek mythology; Nemesis is the Greek goddess of revenge. The implication is that at the Potsdam Conference (17 July to 2 August 1945) the victorious Allies of World War II took revenge on the Germans, entailing significant territorial losses in Eastern Europe and the forced transfer of some 15 million Germans from their homelands in East Prussia, Pomerania, Silesia, East Brandenburg, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Yugoslavia. The book is the first scholarly study in the English concerning the expulsion of Germans after World War II. It effectively broke a taboo in the English- speaking world, and also in Germany and Austria, thus facilitating subsequent research in the subject by other scholars. The book was dedicated to Victor Gollancz, whose seminal book Our Threatened Values had inspired the author when he was a student at Harvard. In chapter VI of the book de Zayas cites Gollancz' clear condemnation of the expulsions: \\"If the conscience of mankind ever again becomes sensitive, these expulsions will be remembered to the undying shame of all who committed or connived at them…The Germans were expelled, not just with an absence of over-nice consideration, but with the very maximum of brutality. (Our Threatened Values, p. 96). On the basis of US and British archival documents, de Zayas shows that the Western Allies were genuinely appalled at the manner in which the Germans were being expelled and that they lodged diplomatic protest notes in Warsaw and Prague—to no avail. The theses of Nemesis at Potsdam have been condensed into a new book, 50 theses on the expulsion of the Germans from Central and Eastern Europe, published in 2012 in Verlag Inspiration, London and Berlin, ...Raymond Lohne, PhD, Columbia College Chicago.

The book is a revised version of a doctoral dissertation for the History Faculty of the University of Göttingen in Germany.

It received praise in the American Journal of International Law, the American Historical Review, Foreign Affairs, the Times Educational Supplement, British Book News etc. However, some historians have criticized the book contending that de Zayas had not given enough space to the Nazi crimes, that he relied too much on the stories of the German victims and their political representatives, that he is too legalistic in his analysis of the Potsdam conference, and because of the tone of the \\"moral outrage\\" expressed by the author.

Most pertinently he insists that we deny what the lesser histories conspire with us to invent—that there are stopping places in history.\\" 22 April 1977, p. 495\\\\. *US Nuremberg Prosecutor Benjamin Ferencz in the American Journal of International Law: \\"The author, effectively using maps and photographs, traces the history of the expellees. Aided by Marshall Plan funds the millions of displaced persons, still longing for their homelands, recognized the futility of resort to force and turned to hard work to rebuild their lives by absorption in a democratic and peaceful society. The Helsinki Conference of 1975 in effect acknowledged that the provisional Oder-Neisse demarcation line implied de facto annexation. The lesson from this well organized and moving historical record is not merely that retribution which penalizes innocent human beings becomes injustice, but that acceptance of political realities may be a better road to human fulfillment than the path of violence Alfred de Zayas has written a persuasive commentary on the suffering which becomes inevitable when humanitarianism is subordinated to nationalism.\\" Vol. 72, October 1978, p. 960\\\\. *A. K. Damodaran in International Studies: \\"An excellent piece of historical research\\", 1991, Volume 28, Number 3, pp. 348–51. *Alfred Connor Bowman in the American Bar Association Journal, December 1977, pp. 1752–54 : \\"The book serves a useful purpose in its careful recapitulation in time sequence of the significant series of historic events that were the aftermath of World War II. For example, it shakes one a bit, but is good for the soul, to be reminded that, although treaties of peace were signed soon after the end of hostilities with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary, there has been no treaty with either Germany. ..especially for lawyers with a historical bent, it will be rewarding reading.\\" *Frederick Dumin, Washington State University, in German Studies Review, October. 1979, pp. 401–02 : \\"When read carefully, this book will be of considerable value to students, interested laymen, and general historians. The rather extensive bibliography is also worthy of note. With increasing concern over human rights, past and present, surely this horrible episode will receive growing attention. Recognizing realities, one cannot see how these injustices can be rectified, since those who committed them have made no effort to even recognize them. One can only hope that two wrongs have taught enough lessons to prevent a third. The historian, however, is bound to deal with these events in the same manner as he deals with earlier crimes against humanity.\\" *James H. Wolfe in Southern Review, 420–421: \\"Beginning with an historical overview of population transfers, the author examines in detail the diplomatic environment of World War II in which the decisions to alter frontiers and transplant populations were made. The Potsdam Conference occupies a key position in his analysis, since on this occasion the United States and Great Britain sanctioned the expulsions. Turning to the study of the human consequences of these forced migrations, de Zayas has frequently relied on interviews, such as that with Robert Murphy, the wartime political adviser of General Eisenhower, and on previously untapped archival resources. The fresh insights of the chapters on Allied military governance and the division of Germany in the immediate postwar period make this work essential reading for students of European international relations.\\" *Carl G. Anthon in the American Historical Review, December 1978, p. 1289, (reviewing the German version, Die Anglo-Amerikaner und die Vertreibung der Deutschen, De Zayas writes with sympathy for the refugees and moral indignation over what he, as an international lawyer, concludes was another crime against humanity, but he strives to show how Allied decisions regarding postwar Germany were the product of many factors, such as horror over Nazi atrocities, the passions of war and victory, and considerable ignorance on the part of Anglo-American leaders regarding the actual state of affairs in Central and Eastern Europe\\". American Historical Review.\\" *Juergen Doerr in Dalhousie Review, 1977, Vol. 15, No. 4 : \\"De Zayas does not ignore the enormity of the crimes committed by Germans during the course of the war, nor does he deny that an anti-German feeling was natural and that punishment was justified, He does, however, question whether one set of crimes justified a second... whether revenge ... was not only extended to the guilty but to the innocent, whether expulsion itself was a crime ...While critical of western leadership, de Zayas leaves no doubt about the agents of the crime—the Soviet leaders. The recent works of A. Solzhenitsyn and Lev Kopelev give further credence to the thesis that Soviet retributive actions were often not spontaneous but were planned ...Praised must be de Zayas's reopening of this largely neglected aspect of modern German history through this brief but well-written account.\\" Vol. 57, No. 3, Autumn 1977, pp. 582–584. *Henry Lane Hull in the Ukrainian Quarterly, Vol. XXXVII, No. 2, p. 181 : \\"The basic thrust of Professor de Zayas' analysis centers on the ineptitude of the Allied leaders before the demands of Marshal Stalin and his successors. As the late Robert Murphy noted in the Foreword, Stalin's unsympathetic disregard of the rights of the individual Germans affected by population transfers is understandable in the context of Soviet hatred of the Nazi war machine. What is not understandable, however, is why Britain and the United States failed to see the injustice visited upon millions .... the bibliography is excellent and four folios of photographs graphically supplement the text. Substantially, organizationally and stylistically, this book is an outstanding historiographical achievement\\". *LaVern Rippley in Die Unterrichtspraxis Vol. 11, No. 2, 1978, pp. 132–13 : \\"Profusely illustrated with photographs, documents and excellent maps, this book analyzes the origin and the effects of article XIII of the Potsdam Protocol which provided that ethnic Germans living in the eastern countries would be transferred to the truncated remains of the Reich 'in an orderly and humane manner'. As the 16 million Germans were driven westward, some two million died, but the world remained silent. Outraged by the crimes Nazis had perpetrated ...the whole world, with a few exceptions, like Bertrand Russell and Albert Schweizer, remained mum.... de Zayas is perhaps best when delineating the legal aspects of the Potsdam action, although his historical facts are equally impeccable....Due to the willingness of the press and the scholarly community in the West to ignore these facts of the Potsdam accord, few Americans or Britons know there ever was an expulsion, let alone authorization of the compulsory transfer. Questioning rhetorically whether the wrong could ever be righted, de Zayas maintains that the West could affirm its regard for individual guilt or innocence and reject the concept of collective guilt.\\" *Craig Whitney in the New York Times, 13 February 1977, and in the International Herald Tribune 17 February 1977 : \\"A young legal scholar from New York, Alfred de Zayas, has written a book on a subject long taboo and ignored by German writers —the brutal expulsion of 16 million Germans from their homelands in Central and Eastern Europe after the Red Army moved in... Mr. de Zayas, who is 29 years old and has a fellowship at the University of Göttingen emphasized: ... 'I had taken a number of courses in history at Fordham and Harvard and this was just never mentioned. I don't think people outside Germany know much about it.' Truman, Churchill and Stalin agreed at Potsdam in 1945 that the German populations of Eastern Europe should undergo 'transfer to Germany' but 'in an orderly and humane manner'. The de Zayas book makes clear that the last provision was not fulfilled.\\" *Christoph Kimmich in Foreign Affairs, July 1977, Vol. 55, No. 4 : \\"An account of British and American acquiescence in the brutal expulsion of millions of Germans from their homes in East-Central Europe at the end of World War II. The author ... makes much of the legal (and moral) implications of the issue while understating its historical complexities.\\" . *David Steeds in British Book News: \\"Mr. de Zayas... is surely right to dwell on their miseries and on the double standards of the victors. Some of them, after all, professed to believe in the principles of the Atlantic Charter. The book should cause argument and controversy; it deserves a wide readership.\\" *David Mutch in the Christian Science Monitor, 25 March 1977, p. 17 : \\"Mr. de Zayas is a lawyer, and is clearly opposed to mass population transfers on moral, legal and historical grounds...He argues that overreaction to the evils of the Nazis led to the principle of collective German guilt, a theory that does not protect the innocent and which ruled the thoughts and actions of many responsible British and American officials when they agreed to the expulsion demands of Stalin. Only later did they realize the inherent inhumanity of the results of their lack of perception...his short but heavily documented book (with 40 pages of notes, a long bibliography, interviews with persons involved, and a long research into unpublished U.S., British and German Documents) fills a gap.\\" *Norman Lederer in Worldview July/August 1978, pp. 54–55 : \\"De Zayas painstakingly details the manner in which Eastern European émigré governments during World War II prepared the way for Allied approval of the mass expulsion of Germans following the conflict. Their distortions of fact had a decided effect on the thinking of many Western leaders. Ironically, it was Winston Churchill, the nemesis depicted in Goebbels' propaganda to the German people, who foresaw most clearly the immense human tragedy that would result from the mass expulsions and who tried to curb the Eastern European countries' desire for territorial expansion at the expense of the German state. The Russian invasion of East Prussia aided the Eastern European leaders in getting their way. Hundreds of thousands of German civilians hurried west before the terrifying apparition of the shockingly undisciplined soviet army. Eastern leaders stated that this exodus had cleared out all the Germans, conveniently ignoring the fact that millions remained. These millions were abruptly ousted once formal conflict had ended ... [The book] is an important work on an enormously important but little known aspect of World War II.\\" *William Guttmann in the Observer: \\"The author traces the genesis of the relevant territorial arrangements and ensuing population transfers and then gives a well-documented and horrifying account of the exodus, the sufferings and deaths of millions, the ruthlessness of the new masters—a travesty of the 'orderly and humane' fashion in which the measures were supposed to be carried out.\\" References to the work *In his 2007 book \\"After the Reich\\" Giles MacDonough(John Murray Publishers, London 2007. pp. 126, 556, etc.) notes: \\"There is a similar lack of documentation in English on events in Czechoslovakia.

Monteverde was the leader of Spanish forces in the Venezuelan War of Independence from 1812 to 1813. Monteverde led the military campaign that culminated in the fall of the First Republic of Venezuela in 1812. One year later in 1813, Monteverde was defeated by Simón Bolívar during the Admirable Campaign. Early life and campaigns in Venezuela Monteverde was born in the Canarian town of San Cristóbal de la Laguna on 2 April 1773. With well won prestige and the rank of Frigate Captain, he was sent to Venezuela from Puerto Rico. He arrived at Coro in early March 1812 along with other Spanish marines. Monteverde was ordered by the governor of Coro, with a small force of 1550 men with soldiers and officers, to aid the small town of Siquisique, which had sent Fr. Andrés Torellas with news that it intended to defect from the Republic. As a nineteenth-century historian described, \\"with Spaniards and residents of Coro, a priest named Torellas, a surgeon, ten thousand cartridges, a howitzer, and ten hundredweights of food.\\" Monteverde's military force was not prepared to begin a successful military campaign.Juan Vicente González: Biografía de José Félix Ribas The scarcity of resources is understandable, considering how Spain found itself fighting the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic forces in order to regain control over its own territory, and had spent the previous decade fighting mostly as an ally of France. There were no resources to send to the New World, in fact, Spain had been asking for donations and increased revenues from America. However, there was one crucial factor which aided Monteverde and the royalist cause: the social dissatisfaction of the people with the new rulers. (This lack of support for the republican leadership would later instigate Bolívar to begin a \\"Social War\\" during his Admirable Campaign.) After a seven-day march, he occupied the town on 17 March, and Monteverde found it easy to recruit new soldiers from the local population. With a growing force, he decided to continue marching into republican territory, despite having no authorization to do so. His successful advance was helped by the social support offered it by the lower classes, which viewed the mantuano (aristocratic) republican rulers as their enemies. He created an integrated military force of pardos, zambos, Canary Islanders, and other lower-class peoples. Middling and upper- class people also joined his cause. Many city leaders opened their cities to his informal army, and several mantuanos (among them the Marqués of Casa Leon) became his collaborators. This movement was reinforced by the earthquake on 26 March 1812 and the loss on 30 June of Puerto Cabello under the then-Colonel Simón Bolívar to royalist prisoners who managed to take over San Felipe Fort. Monteverde's vanguard under Francisco Marmól entered Barquisimeto on 2 April after the city defected to the royalist side on 31 March. Eventually he had an army large enough to march on Valencia, the site of a royalist uprising the previous year. After winning a battle against republican troops defending the city on 3 May, he was welcomed by the city. His next goal was Caracas. In June, Monteverde arrived in the proximity of La Victoria and San Mateo, forcing Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda to retreat. Monteverde's advance culminated in a capitulation agreed between Miranda and Monteverde on 25 July 1812 after the Battle of San Mateo. (Miranda never signed the final version, but it had been approved by his representatives in the negotiations.) After the fall of the first republic, Miranda was imprisoned and sent to Puerto Rico and later Cádiz. The majority of the patriot officials chose to go into exile, which was an option offered to them under the capitulation. In 1813, Santiago Mariño decided to invade Venezuela from the east, successfully capturing the port of Güiria, which was protected by a very small loyalist force, and later the plaza of Maturín, which Monteverde attempted, but failed to retake. Bolívar began his Admirable Campaign, entering through the Andes. Worried about Bolívar's presence near the Llanos, Monteverde established the main branch for his forces in Valencia, a location in the plains at which the paths of Barinas, the Andes, and Maracaibo merge. His right flank was fortressed in the castle of Puerto Cabello and his rear was supported in Maracay and La Victoria. The positioning of Monteverde's military forces were comparable to those of Miranda in 1812. Nevertheless, Monteverde lost a large part of the popular support that he had managed to build the previous year: the people who had taken him from Coro to the capital abandoned him in the face of Mariño in Maturín and Bolívar in Valencia because Monteverde did not meet, or allow the completion of, popular goals and expectations in 1813. Monteverde was wounded in action at Las Trincheras on 3 October 1813, and near the end of the same year, he was deposed by his own officers in Puerto Cabello. Field Marshal Juan Manuel Cajigal, nominally chief of José Tomás Boves, assumed the Captaincy General of Venezuela. Monteverde moved to Puerto Rico and in 1816 returned to Spain. Monteverde died in Cádiz on 15 September 1832 with the rank of Brigadier.

He was Janis Joplin's fiancé at the time of her death in October 1970. Early life Morgan was the son of soap fortune heir and poet George Frederick Morgan, and Constance Canfield. The Esquire article, \\"Seth Morgan's Last Ride\\" (February 1, 1991), recounts Morgan's description of his mother and childhood: Morgan stated she was \\"an alcoholic beauty who drank herself to death in 1964\\", and he claimed that her coldness was to blame for his brother's suicide (by leaping to his death off the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge). Morgan also believed that he inherited what he called his \\"addictive personality\\" from his alcoholic mother. He later said that he harbored intense bitterness towards women because of his mother's treatment of him and his siblings, and he spent years \\"planning the strategic degradation of women\\". Morgan attended several elite private academies: St. Bernard's School in New York, from which he was expelled, Hotchkiss School in Connecticut, from which he was also expelled, The American School in Switzerland, from which he was also expelled, and The Butler Institute in Guadalajara, Mexico. He also briefly attended University of California Berkeley and received a trust fund income between US$26,000 and US$30,000 a year. Relationship with Janis Joplin In 1970, Morgan dropped out of U.C. Berkeley. Later that year, he met singer Janis Joplin while allegedly delivering cocaine to her home in Marin County. The two began a relationship and became engaged. Their relationship became public knowledge in Joplin's obituary in TIME. Criminal record After Joplin’s death, Morgan married a Sausalito waitress. She worked as a prostitute during their marriage, while Morgan acted as her pimp. The marriage was short-lived, and Morgan later claimed he had married the woman to prevent her from suing him after the two had been involved in a motorcycle accident that left her face partially paralyzed. (A drunken Morgan had crashed his Harley into a house formerly owned by Jack London.) Morgan then moved to San Francisco, where he married for a second time, found work as a barker at strip clubs, and developed an addiction to heroin. To support his habit, he began committing armed robberies. During one robbery, Morgan pinned a victim’s hand to the floor with a knife. In 1977, the police caught him committing a robbery, and he was sentenced to 30 months in prison. After his release, he went back to working in strip clubs. In 1986, he moved to New Orleans with, he later admitted, plans to drink himself to death but decided to write a novel, instead.Seinfelt (1999), p. 433 Career Morgan's only title published was Homeboy (1990), a novel about heroin addicts and criminals in San Francisco. In it, Morgan used several experiences from his own life, including time spent as a barker in San Francisco and his prison term for armed robbery. He included a character who was a flamboyantly dressed prostitute who was based on Janis Joplin. While incarcerated in the 1970s, Morgan had won the P.E.N. essay contest for convicts. From 1986 to 1987, Morgan lived in the Lower Garden District of New Orleans, at 1232 St. Andrew Street, a rental property owned by Metairie resident Marcel Jaffe. During this time, Morgan was sober, spending his time writing, attending Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings, working out at the Lee's Circle YMCA, and hanging out at the Hummingbird Grill, a New Orleans greasy spoon that has since closed. In the spring of 1990, the publication of Homeboy led to positive reviews and book-signing engagements for Morgan in several cities, including San Francisco, where 14 years earlier he had impaled a bystander's hand with a knife during an armed robbery. Morgan told Suzie Groover, who accompanied him on the publicity tour, that he was afraid of getting arrested on outstanding warrants from years earlier. Death On October 16, 1990, Morgan was arrested in New Orleans for DUI and was released on bail that was paid by his girlfriend Suzy Levine, age 37. The following night, Morgan picked up Levine at a bar in the French Quarter, and departed at approximately 11:30 pm, on Morgan's 1972 red and white Shovelhead Harley Davidson motorcycle. Shortly before midnight, Morgan was traveling on the St. Claude Avenue Bridge and hit the median strip, while attempting to maneuver into the right lane. Levine was thrown 45 feet down the roadway while Morgan crashed face first into a cement piling. Both were killed instantly. An autopsy later revealed that Morgan had Percodan and cocaine in his system, and his blood alcohol content was nearly three times the legal limit. Neither Morgan nor Levine was wearing a helmet at the time of the crash. Morgan is buried in the Seaside Cemetery in Blue Hill, Maine. Legacy His obituary reported that at the time he died Morgan was working on a second novel. Nearly four months later, a long article about Morgan in The Washington Post Style section quoted a representative of his publishing company as saying Morgan left behind outlines for some of the chapters and nothing else. The spokesperson considered that detail important because company officials were glad they had given Morgan only a small advance to work on the novel even though he had pleaded for a lot more money, and the amount they insisted on giving him made him \\"bitter\\". The second novel was never published.

The film is based on the novel of the same name and was adapted for the screen by its author Adam Kennedy. It was directed and produced by Stanley Kramer. Kramer wrote in his memoirs that he \\"wouldn't be surprised\\" if Hackman, Bergen and Widmark \\"would prefer to remain as anonymous as the conspirators\\" in the film, adding \\"if I'm right, it's a feeling I share.\\" Plot Roy Tucker (Gene Hackman), serving time for the murder of his wife's first husband, is approached in prison by a man named Tagge (Richard Widmark) on behalf of a mysterious organization with an offer: in exchange for helping him escape and start a new life, Tucker must work for the organization for a few weeks. Following his escape with cellmate Spiventa (Mickey Rooney), whom the organization immediately kills, Tucker flies to Puntarenas, Costa Rica where he is reunited with his wife Ellie (Candice Bergen). After a few idyllic days, the organization's Tagge, Pine (Edward Albert) and General Reser (Eli Wallach) return them to Los Angeles. There, the details of his mission slowly unfold. He realizes that he is expected to assassinate someone and refuses. The organization retaliates by kidnapping his wife. The next morning, Tucker fires on his target from a helicopter, but it is hit by return fire and crashes. Tucker and Reser escape but Tucker takes Pine hostage and demand a plane and the return of his wife. At the airstrip, Tucker tells Tagge that he deliberately fired short. Tagge reveals that he had two other shooters in place, including Tucker's supposedly murdered cellmate Spiventa, and Tagge's group has been manipulating Tucker for over a decade. Aboard the plane with Ellie, Tucker spots someone planting a toolbox in the back of Tagge's car. Unable to get the pilot to abort takeoff, Tucker watches helplessly as Tagge is blown up with his car. The couple return to Costa Rica where Tucker sees his new life dismantled as quickly as it was assembled: his false passport destroyed, his money taken and Ellie killed. Spiventa and Pine arrive to kill Tucker, but he gets the drop on them and dumps their bodies in the ocean. The film closes with a resolute Tucker vowing not to give in, unaware he is in the crosshairs of yet another assassin.

Hackman later said \\"we had a lot of problems on that film; I had arguments with Stanley Kramer.\\" Hackman later read a published diary written by Kramer during the making of the film which described Hackman's behavior on set. The actor called the diary \\"embarrassing but I have to say it was accurate. And he was probably right in his remarks about me. The film we were making just wasn't worth the difficulties I was giving him. The truth is I was in trouble on that film and I got scared.\\" In December 1976 Bergen said about the film, \\"thanks to Gene it turned out to be the best part I've ever done. I said, 'I have such a long way to go before I can become that woman, Gene. I just can't do it unless you help me.' He was incredibly generous with his time and energy, his enthusiasm and his outrageous skill. For the first time I took a risk and didn't rely on my looks.\\"At the Movies Flatley, Guy.

I put on a sappy wig and wore sappy clothes and for once in my life I didn't look like Candice Bergen and they [the critics] creamed me for that saying I looked like Shelley Winters.\\" Reception =Critical response= The film opened to mostly negative reviews and lasted only two to three weeks in theaters, dooming Kramer's first attempt at directing a thriller. Film critic Vincent Canby of New York Times (which wasn't full of praise for the film) focused on the fact that the movie's plot made no sense, noting at one point that when Hackman's character said \\"I've done a lot of bad things in my life, but I ain't going to do that\\" the question of \\"What is he not going to do?\\" was neither established nor answered. The Variety Staff wrote in their review: \\"The Domino Principle is a weak and tedious potboiler starring Gene Hackman as a tool of mysterious international intrigue, and a barely recognizable Candice Bergen in a brief role as his perplexed wife. Stanley Kramer’s film contains a lot of physical and logistical nonsense.\\" =Box Office= According to Lew Grade, who helped finance the film, it \\"broke even.\\"Alexander Walker, National Heroes: British Cinema in the Seventies and Eighties, 1985 p 197 \\"I'm told a lot of people didn't understand it,\\" said Hackman later. \\"I didn't understand it either.\\"HACKMAN RESTLESS AS THE SQUIRE OF BEVERLY HILLS Mann, Roderick.

St. Joseph's deliberately lost in the final in order to avoid being relegated, which caused controversy at the time. As such, the management of the two clubs decided in order to strengthen Marist rugby. The merged club was named Marist Rugby Football Club, the St. Joseph was added to the club name in order to entice the former St. Joseph's College players to play for the newly created club rather than playing for their village teams. John Maihi and Brother Clement were appointed as coaches. Its first clubhouse, in Alafua, where currently is located Don Bosco technical school.

The formerly unnamed area is sometimes considered to be a part of NoMad, because the name \\"Rose Hill\\" was chiefly used for the area in the 18th and 19th centuries, and is not very commonly used to refer to the area in the 2010s.

According to the New York City Department of Parks,NYC Parks: Rose Hill Park: The Watts are called \\"Watt\\".

Barclay and John Watts, Jr. to two daughters of Peter DeLancey, at \\"Union Hill\\" in Westchester (a property of Cadwalader Golden, Delancey's father-in-law), was recorded in Rivington's New-York Gazetteer (R. Burnham Moffat, The Barclays of New York 1904::104 note 13). Robert's brother John married his cousin Jane DeLancey, whose family lived on the adjacent property, which is now Bronx Park. Prior to his marriage, John Watt had lived on his Manhattan properties. He purchased the Bronx property in 1787 from the estate of Andrew Corsa. Shortly afterward, John transferred the property to his brother Robert, who named it \\"Rose Hill\\".The name was transferred to property at Tivoli, New York of John Watts de Peyster, whose father, Frederic De Peyster, had married Mary Justina Watts (died 1821), youngest daughter of the Hon. John Watts, in the front parlor at 3, Broadway, in 1820 (Frank Allaben, John Watts de Peyster (1908:25); see also the description in Arthur G. Adams, The Hudson River Guidebook 1996:233, at mile 96.00. Archival research by Roger Wines, professor of history at Fordham, has shown that the original owner of the manor was a Dutchman named Reyer Michaelson. Benjamin Corsa married Michaelson's daughter and was deeded the house and land in 1736. John Hughes, Roman Catholic Bishop of New York, purchased Rose Hill in 1839 as the future site of Fordham's forerunner, St. John's College.Fordham Tradition, September 1989, on-line text). Rose Hill on the Watts Farm =Watts' ownership= 25th Street According to a historical genealogical source, the first \\"Rose Hill\\" was the farm acquired from James DeLancey in November 1747(John Watts), Dorothy C. Barck, ed., \\"Letter book of John Watts: merchant and councillor of New York\\", New-York Historical Society Collections, 61 (1928:xiii). by the Hon. John Watts (1715–1789), who represented the city for many years in the Colonial Assembly. The farm contained over which lay on the East River between what were to become 21st and 30th streets and between the future 4th Avenue and the water. Watts' residence in town was at 3 Broadway, facing Bowling Green. Watts was the son of Robert Watts, of \\"Rose Hill\\", near Edinburgh, and Mary, eldest daughter of William Nicoll, of Islip, Long Island; John named the farm in commemoration of his father's house. In July 1742, John married Ann, youngest daughter of Stephen DeLancey. As Loyalists, they left for Britain in 1775 and never returned, leaving \\"Rose Hill\\" and the Broadway house in the hands of their son John Watts (1749—1836). John (2nd) received both houses outright in his father's will, proved September 12, 1789.John Watts' will is abstracted in \\"New York gleanings in England\\", The New -York Genealogical and Biographical Record (April 1905:116f). The main house at Rose Hill burned in 1779, during the British occupation, but a deed from the 1780s mentions \\"houses, buildings, orchards, gardens\\" on the land. Parts of Rose Hill Farm were being sold off in the 1780s: in 1786, Nicholas Cruger paid \\"144 pounds\\" for a lot at the north edge of the property, consisting of most of what is now the block bounded by 29th and 30th Streets and Second and Third Avenues. =Sale= Having been rebuilt and refurbished after the Revolutionary War, Rose Hill Farm was put up for sale in 1790. As Advertised in the New-York Daily Advertiser:February 9, 1790, page 4 Revolutionary War General Horatio Gates acquired part or all of the Watts property in 1790 and established a country seat in a mansion at the present corner of Second Avenue and 22nd Street. He died at his estate in April 1806, whereupon his home became a boarding house.(1) (2) The Cruger parcel was subdivided into building lots by the time the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 was adopted, establishing Manhattan's present street grid. Just to the southwest corner of the \\"Rose Hill\\" property, Gramercy Park was laid out in 1831, on the axis of what became Lexington Avenue. The map made in 1866 by John Bute Holmes, of \\"Rose Hill Farm Gramercy Seat, and the estate of John Watts\\" is conserved in the New York Public Library.NYPL Bulletin, 1 (1897), \\"Principal Book Purchases and Gifts\\" p. 141, s.v. \\"Holmes (John Bute)\\".

The community has several single room occupancy supportive housing ventures. One such venture is Friends House in Rosehill, a Quaker venture that, in effect, recovered the neighborhood's old name;Friends House in Rosehill official website another is the Prince George Hotel, sponsored by Common Ground. =Madison Square= The New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department Madison Square anchors the neighborhood's southwest corner, bounded by 23rd Street, 26th Street, Fifth Avenue, and Madison Avenue. The original Madison Square Garden at Madison Square was located at the corner of Madison Avenue and 26th Street, and stood at the site from 1879 to 1890. The second Madison Square Garden, located at the same site, was designed by Stanford White, who would later be killed at the Garden's rooftop restaurant. This second incarnation of Madison Square Garden stood at 26th Street from 1890 to 1925, when the Garden was relocated to the West Side at 50th Street and Eighth Avenue. White kept an apartment in the tower of Madison Square Garden; there are conflicting accounts of whether the famous \\"red velvet swing\\" was in that apartment, or in a nearby building on 24th Street which White rented. In 2007, the building on 24th Street collapsed due to damage from a fire that occurred in 2003.

If the systolic blood pressure is elevated (>140) with a normal (<90) diastolic blood pressure (DBP), it is called \\"isolated systolic hypertension\\". Causes Systolic hypertension may be due to reduced compliance of the aorta with increasing age. This increases the load on the ventricle and compromises coronary blood flow, eventually resulting in left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary ischemia, and heart failure. Contemporary science shows an immersed boundary method of computational illustration of a single heartbeat. Applied to physiologic models, immersed boundary theory sees the heart as a great folded semisolid sail fielding and retrieving a viscous blood mass. The sail, likened to Windkessel effect physiology, gives and receives a load under time-ordered phases. Decreasing compliance of the sail heralds the onset of systolic hypertension. Treatment The goal of treating systolic hypertension is to delay and reduce the extent of damage to the heart, the cerebrovascular system, and the kidneys. Lifestyle interventions are a crucial element of successful treatment, including a diet low in sodium (salt) and rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Clinical trials have also documented the beneficial effects of weight loss, increased physical activity, and limiting alcohol consumption. In addition to lifestyle changes, medication can also be used to reduce systolic hypertension to safe levels. =Goal= Based on these studies, treating to a systolic blood pressure of 140, as long as the diastolic blood pressure is 68 or more, seems safe. Corroborating this, a reanalysis of the SHEP data suggests allowing the diastolic to go below 70 may increase adverse effects. A meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomized controlled trials found the lowest diastolic blood pressure for which cardiovascular outcomes improve is 85 mm Hg for untreated hypertensives and 80 mm Hg for treated hypertensives. The authors concluded \\"poor health conditions leading to low blood pressure and an increased risk for death probably explain the J-shaped curve\\". Interpreting the meta-analysis is difficult, but avoiding a diastolic blood pressure below 68–70 mm Hg seems reasonable because: * The low value of 85 mm Hg for treated hypertensives in the meta-analysis is higher than the value of 68–70 mm Hg that is suggested by the two major randomized controlled trials of isolated systolic hypertension * The two largest trials in the meta-analysis, Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program (HDFP) and Medical Research Council trial in mild hypertension (MRC1) were predominantly middle-aged subjects, all of whom had diastolic hypertension before treatment. * The independent contributions of diseases and factors other than hypertension versus effects of treatment are not clear in the meta-analysis. A more contemporary meta-analysis by the Cochrane Hypertension group found no benefits in terms of reduced mortality or morbidity from treating patients to lower diastolic targets than 90–100 mmHg.Arguedas JA, Perez MI, Wright JM. Treatment blood pressure targets for hypertension. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2009, Issue 3. Art. No.: CD004349. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004349.pub2.

The area is best known in South Korea as an affluent neighborhood populated by a disproportionately high number of high-income individuals and for having some of the most expensive real estate in the country. It is known as an upmarket shopping area, with the main shopping street dubbed 'Cheongdam Fashion Street'. Along with Apgujeong’s Rodeo Street in Apgujeong-dong and Garosu-gil in Sinsa-dong, which are connected by the main Apgujeong-ro, they are seen as fashionable and trendsetting destinations. Characteristics Ermenegildo Zegna store in 2012 Cartier Maison and Salvatore Ferragamo stores in 2012 This area was originally named Chungsutgol which means clean water valley, for a clean pond that existed here during the Joseon Dynasty. Until Joseon Dynasty and the Japanese Colonial Era in the early 20th century, it was a part of Gyeonggi Province which currently indicates the outskirt of Seoul, the capital city of Republic of Korea. On January 1, 1963, Cheongdam-dong was incorporated into Seoul. On October 1, 1973, it became one of the 26 dong (neighborhoods) of the Gangnam District or Gangnam-gu. Gangnam-gu is one of the 25 gu (gu refers to local government district in Korea) in Seoul. Since 1988, Cheongdam- dong has been divided into two sub-regions: Cheongdam 1 dong and Cheongdam 2 dong. Seoul Districts Cheongdam-dong was underdeveloped up till 10 years ago, during which time, galleries moved to this area. It formed the existing gallery street, near the Galleria Department Store in Apgujeong-dong towards Cheongdam Park. Apart from galleries and luxury shopping the area also has high-end restaurants, bars, clubs, cafes and beauty salons; and known as an upscale residential area, especially for Korean celebrities such as actors and K-pop artists. The 760-meter-long section of main street Apgujeong-ro, that runs from Apgujeongrodeo Station at Galleria Department Store to Cheongdam crossroad, has been dubbed the 'Cheongdam Fashion Street' or 'Cheongdamdong Street of Luxury Goods'. It is lined with stores of luxury brands, such as Ermenegildo Zegna, Salvatore Ferragamo, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Burberry, as well as outlets for 3.1 Phillip Lim, Martin Margiela and Tory Burch and Korean designer Son Jung-wan. Attractions Vera Wang Bridal Korea in 2012 The area is the location for the headquarters of K-pop management companies S.M. Entertainment, Cube Entertainment, and J. Tune Entertainment, and was the location of the old building for JYP Entertainment, before it was moved near the Olympic Park, which is still in Gangnam District. Since January 2012, the area is also home to FNC Entertainment, who moved into their own company offices, separate from their parent company in Mnet Media Building in neighbouring Apgujeong-dong. The MCM Haus flagship store is also located in the area.

In media * 5 March 2012: Shinhwa comeback press conference after a four-year hiatus, where they served mandatory military service, was held at CGV Cheongdam-dong, which was also streamed live by Mnet Media to 200 countries. * In December 2012, the area was the setting for SBS weekend drama series, Cheongdam-dong Alice. It stars Moon Geun-young, Park Si-hoo, So Yi-hyun and Kim Ji-seok, and is based on the novel, Cheongdamdong Audrey. * In May 2013, the 10 Corso Como store was used as a filming location for the music video of Psy's 2013 single \\"Gentleman\\". *In 2018, Seungri filmed his Netflix sitcom/mockumentary YG Future Strategy Office outside the old JYP Entertainment building, which was the final variety show/sitcom that featured the building. =Image of \\"Luxury Town\\"= In media coverage, Cheongdam-dong is often portrayed as a luxury town. Korean drama series such as \\"Cheongdam-dong Alice\\", \\"Cheongdam-dong Scandal\\", and \\"I Live in Cheongdam-dong\\" all had Cheongdam-dong as a backdrop that is full of luxury brand stores, rich people, celebrities, and drama. The \\"Fashion Street\\" area is also called \\"new-money neighborhood\\", a place \\"where the most immaculately dressed, beautiful, and yet curiously unhappy-looking women in Korean can be seen.\\" While it is true that a part of Cheongdam-dong is full of luxury brand stores, K-Pop hubs, and galleries, this public image tends to get overly generalized, mainly due to skewed media portrayal. In fact, a large portion of Cheongdam-dong is composed of residential area, where ordinary people live their everyday lives. They live in apartment complex such as Samick apartment, Hyundai apartment, and Woosung apartment, which are usually formed around public parks or schools. Although the image of luxury town remains true to some extent, it should not take over other aspects of Choengdam-dong, as for some people this place means home. Transportation There are mainly three types of public transportation running in and through Cheongdam-dong: Bus, Subway, and Taxi. An electronic pre-paid card called T-money can be typically used for all three types of transportation, in addition to credit cards and cash. For more information about getting around Cheongdam-dong, visit the official Korea Tourism webpage. *Bus: Buses of four colors run in Cheongdam-dong, just like in the rest of Seoul. Bus lines that pass through Cheongdam-dong include: 143, 146, 2415, 3414, 3011, 9407, 9507, and many more. *Subway: Three main subway stations in Cheongdam-dong are Cheongdam station, Apgujeong Rodeo station, and Gangnam-gu Office Station.

Although there are several players who have done this, Holgate is unusual because he played for both rivals in two consecutive seasons. Born in Sawley, Barnoldswick, then in Yorkshire, England, Holgate was a wicket-keeper, standing 5 ft. 7 inches tall and weighing 11 stone, he took 24 catches and completed 10 stumpings. He scored 455 runs as a right-handed middle order batsman, at an average of 13.78, with a top score of 65 against Surrey. A professional, his first match for Lancashire was the County Club's second ever game against Birkenhead Park, at Birkenhead, on 15 and 16 July 1864. Batting at number 10 he scored 10 and a duck, took a catch and made a stumping. The following year he was playing for Yorkshire. In 1866, he played for both counties, as he did in the following year, when he played for Lancashire against Yorkshire on 20–22 June at Whalley, in the first Roses Match. By September in the third match between the two counties, at Middlesbrough, he played for Yorkshire. He played for both counties again the following year, and in 1868 took a season playing for the United England Eleven, playing against local twenty-twos, and in other matches against odds. He played for Accrington Cricket Club and was one of that Club's early captains. His grandson, also Gideon, was secretary of the Lancashire League from February 1935 until his death, at his home in Clitheroe, on 16 November 1949. He is also a distant relative of academic and musician Kathy Hampson (born 1966). Holdgate died in July 1895 in Accrington, Lancashire.

It has smooth bark throughout, mostly only juvenile, more or less heart-shaped, glaucous leaves, glaucous flower buds arranged in groups of three, white flowers and cylindrical or hemispherical fruit.E. cordata, juvenile leavesE. cordata, buds Description Eucalyptus cordata is a scraggy shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of between and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth greenish yellow to brown or grey bark throughout and has glaucous branchlets. Larger trees sometimes have rough bark on the lower part of the trunk. Its crown is mostly composed of juvenile leaves and adult leaves are usually only found at the top of the tallest trees. The leaves of young plants, coppice regrowth and mature plants have sessile leaves arranged in opposite pairs, the leaves egg- shaped to almost round, long and wide with wavy edges. Adult leaves, only present in the crown of tall trees, are arranged alternately, lance-shaped, long and wide on a flattened petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of three in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on a very short pedicel. Mature buds are oval to club-shaped, green or glaucous, long and wide with a rounded, flattened or beaked operculum. Flowering has been observed in most months, with peaks between May and June, September and November, and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup- shaped, cylindrical or hemispherical capsule long and wide and sessile or on a very short pedicel. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus cordata was first formally described in 1806 by Jacques Labillardière who published the description in Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. The specific epithet (cordata) is a Latin word meaning \\"heart-shaped\\" referring to the leaves. In 2008, Dean Nicolle, Brad Potts and Gay McKinnon described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus cordata Labill. subsp. cordata, that has branchlets that are circular in cross section; * Eucalyptus cordata subsp. quadrangulosa D.Nicolle, B.M.Potts & McKinnon, that has branchlets that are square in cross-section. Distribution and habitat Heart-leaved silver gum has a restricted distribution in the south-east of Tasmania, growing at intermediate altitudes such as on the foothills of Mount Wellington, on the Snug Plains and around Port Arthur and Moogara. The tree makes an attractive ornamental with its large, glaucous juvenile leaves, which often persist in the crown.Brooker, I. & Kleinig, D., Eucalyptus, An illustrated guide to identification, Reed Books, Melbourne, 1996 Subspecies cordata mainly occurs south from Triabunna and is found on Bruny and Maria Islands. Subspecies quadrangulosa is centred on the Wellington Range but is most prolific on the Snug Plains.

Rather than commit full armies both sides agreed to pitting 300 of their best men against each other. According to HerodotusHerodotus, The Histories 1.82 Sparta had surrounded and captured the plain of Thyrea. When the Argives marched out to defend it, the two armies agreed to let 300 champions from each city fight, with the winner taking the territory. Presumably the idea was to reduce the total number of casualties. Both armies marched home, so as to prevent either side from helping their champions and escalating the duel into a full battle. Neither side would allow for any injured men to be taken. The day called for complete destruction of the enemy force for victory. The two armies were evenly matched and neither could gain the upper hand. They fought until nightfall, and after a bloody battle only three men remained, two Argives and one Spartan. The Argives, Alcenor and Chromius, believing that they had killed all of the Spartans, left the battlefield racing home to Argos to announce their victory. However, they had made one mistake: Othryades, an injured Spartan, had survived. As he was technically the last man standing on the battlefield from either army, he too claimed victory. He survived long enough to tell his baggage handlers of this, and then he committed suicide. By tradition, Othryades was ashamed to be the only man in his unit to live, and so he killed himself on the field of battle rather than return to Sparta. The reason for the suicide is up for debate, but the act is of great importance. Othryades did not die by an Argive sword, and the Spartans could always claim that he survived the battle and killed himself in shame, thus gaining an upper hand due to this act of honor. Both sides were able to claim victory: the Argives because more of their champions had survived, and the Spartans because their single champion held the field. Argos did not take too kindly to the Spartans claiming victory and sent their entire hoplite army which was met by a Spartan force of equal size. The Spartans won a decisive victory and as a result gained control of Thyreatis. Pausanias adds that the battle was foretold by the Sibyl, and that the Argives considered themselves the victors and dedicated a bronze sculpture of the Trojan horse at Delphi to commemorate the victory. However, Pausanias says that the sculptor of this horse was Antiphanes of Argos, who dates to ca. 400 BC. Therefore, either Pausanias is mistaken, or he confused this with a battle at Thyrea in 424 BC. Years later, in 420 BC during a lull in the Peloponnesian War, Argos challenged Sparta to a rematch of the Battle of the 300 Champions. Sparta declined.

Though the grouping is often encountered in the literature, it is an areal grouping, not a genetic grouping. In other words, the languages are grouped together because they were spoken near one another, not because they are more closely related to one another than to other Algonquian languages. Within the Algonquian family, only Eastern Algonquian is a valid genealogical group. Within the Central Algonquian grouping, Potawatomi and Chippewa, otherwise known as Ojibwe, are closely related and are generally grouped together as an Ojibwa-Potawatomi sub-branch. \\"Eastern Great Lakes\\" was first proposed by Richard Rhodes in 1988, and first discussed by Ives Goddard as \\"Core Central\\" in 1994. In Goddard's assessment, he divides the \\"Core Central\\" into the Ojibwa-Potawatomi and Miami-Illinois group, and the Sauk-Fox-Kickapoo and Shawnee group; the hypothesis for the subgroup was based on lexical and phonological innovations. David J. Costa in his 2003 book The Miami-Illinois Language agrees with Rhodes and Goddard that Central Algonquian has a specific language sub-branch that he refers to as \\"Eastern Great Lakes\\" but in his assessment Costa also states \\"...there seems to be no evidence that Miami- Illinois is closer to Ojibwe-Potawatomi than it is to Sauk-Fox-Kickapoo.\\" Family division The languages are listed below along with dialects and subdialects.

His distinctive style was characteristic of the Romantic ideals of natural beauty.  Life  Der gesprengte Turm des Heidelberger Schlosses (The Ruined Tower of Heidelberg Castle, c. 1830) His father was a minor tax official from Regensburg. From 1805 to 1815 he attended the Lyceum at the Oberkirche St.Nikolai in Cottbus. His parents could not afford to pay for any further education, so they apprenticed him to a banker and he was engaged in that profession until 1822, when an increasing interest in art led him to the Berlin Academy. After a short study trip to Dresden and Saxon Switzerland, he returned to Berlin and obtained a position as a decorator for the Royal Theater on the Alexanderplatz. He married in 1824 and became a member of the Berlin Artists' Association in 1827. Later that year, he was dismissed from the Theater because of an ongoing dispute with singer Henriette Sontag. After that, he tried to support himself as a free-lance artist. In 1828, he took a study trip to the Baltic Sea, followed by a trip to Italy which produced hundreds of sketches that were later elaborated in his Berlin studio. He had been deeply impressed by the landscapes there and altered his entire manner of painting to reflect what he had seen. =Final years and illness= In 1831, upon the recommendation of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, he was appointed Professor of Landscape Painting at the Berlin Academy. In 1835 he became a full member of the Academy and took a study trip to Paris. It was then that the first symptoms of his mental illness appeared. His condition deteriorated and he suffered severe bouts of depression that forced him to take a leave of absence from the Academy in 1836. The following year, he had to be admitted to a hospital. He was able to make one final trip to Dresden, where he made his last drawings. He died four years later, in a state of total mental derangement. He was buried in the Holy Trinity Cemetery (II), but the exact location is no longer known. He is commemorated with a plaque on the cemetery wall. A street, a park and an elementary school in Cottbus were named after him.

In this alloy, the proportion of gold is 22 parts out of 24 (91.667% gold) — and is appreciably less prone to wear than the softer 23 kt gold of earlier gold sovereigns — an important point for coins intended for everyday use in circulation. Alloying metal The alloying metal in England was, and is, traditionally restricted to copper. This is still used for the current British gold sovereign. An exception was for the gold sovereigns of 1887, when 1.25% silver, replacing the same weight of copper, was used to gain a better reproduction the image of Queen Victoria for the Golden Jubilee of her reign. Elsewhere, both copper and silver have been used in varying proportions. Circulating coins In the United States until 1834, gold circulating coins were minted in 22 kt. crown gold — although using about 6% silver as well as copper. From 1834, the fineness of U.S. coin gold was decreased from the 22 kt \\"crown gold\\" standard to 0.8992 fine (21.58 kt); and in 1837 to 0.900 fine (21.60 kt exactly). This 90% gold–copper alloy continued in the U.S. from 1837 until gold coins were removed from circulation in the U.S. in 1933. The South African Krugerrand, first produced in 1967, is produced in the traditional crown gold recipe of 22 kt gold, (remainder copper), because it was originally intended to circulate as currency. Bullion coins Most gold coinage nowadays is not designed for daily use and circulation, so the requirement for a hard alloy is much less — and such bullion coins are commonly of pure gold of 24 kt, 0.999, 0.9999, or even 0.99999 fine (see Canadian Maple Leaf). Regardless, some bullion coins have stayed with the traditional crown gold standard, including the British sovereign, the Krugerrand, and American Gold Eagles.

Biography  Rodrigo del Junco was baptized in the Roman Catholic church of Santa Maria de Junco in Ribadesella. He had one brother, Juan del Junco. Rodrigo del Junco attained the rank of captain in the Spanish Army and before 1550, served Philip II of Spain as an agent of the Kingdom of Naples, and later became a factor in Florida. He settled in San Agustín as a factor and Overseer of the Royal Estate of La Florida. In late June 1579, King Philip II of Spain sent one hundred soldiers to Florida to reinforce the province's defenses. Nearly 50 of them drowned when the galleon Santiago el Menor sank near the port of San Augustine. Governor Pedro Menéndez de Márquez sent a request to Rodrigo de Junco for fifty more soldiers to replace the soldiers who had died; Junco complied with his request. When the presidio's soldiers balked at laboring on construction of a new wooden fort because such work was not, according to them, part of their duties, Rodrigo de Junco asked Philip II to send 30 slaves from Havana for that purpose. Consequently, Philip issued an order for the slaves to be sent to Florida for 4 years. Most of them worked under harsh conditions, and twenty of them were sent to Santa Elena to repair the fort there. In 1550, Rodrigo del Junco returned to Seville, where on 16 March he was granted, before the notary Diego de la Barrera, a new fiduciary power to take effect in Florida. On February 7, 1587, he was given, along with his wife, permission before the clerk Martin Calvo de la Puerta to sell some houses that they owned in Seville. About 1590 Rodrigo del Junco returned with his family to Florida, where, according to Francisco Xavier de Santa Cruz y Mallén in his Historia de familias cubanas, he was appointed governor in 1592, but died the same year in a shipwreck off the coast of Florida. Rodrigo del Junco was the second husband of Francisca de Miranda Santo Domingo. They had at least two children, Bartolomeo del Junco y Miranda and Maria del Junco- Miranda.

Personal life Manuel María was born on 18 June 1808 in Santiago de Cali, then part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada, the oldest child of José María Mallarino y Vargas, a Spaniard natural of Cádiz of Italian descent, and Juana María de la Concepción Ibargüen (née Scarpetta Roo y Bedoya), a Criolla natural of Cali also of Italian descent. His two younger siblings were María Josefa and Francisco Antonio. He attended the University of Cauca graduating Juris Doctor on 17 July 1831. On 11 August 1836 he married María Mercedes Cabal Borrero, daughter of José Antonio Víctor Cabal Molina and María Petrona Borrero y Costa, and natural of Buga, in his father-in-law's hacienda in El Cerrito. Manuel María and María Mercedes had seven children: José María, Victor, Antonio, Susana, Gonzalo, Sofía, and Julio Daniel. His nephews Carlos and Jorge Holguín Mallarino, sons of his sister María Josefa, became prominent Conservative party politicians who like him served in Congress and as Acting Presidents; Jorge went on to serve as the 10th President of Colombia. Secretary of Foreign Affairs (1846–1848) Mallarino served as the 21st, 23rd, and 25th Secretary of Foreign Affairs of New Granada during the Administration of President Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera y Arboleda. In 1846, Chancellor Mallarino was commissioned to negotiate and sign with the United States Chargé d'Affaires in New Granada, Benjamin Alden Bidlack, the Mallarino–Bidlack Treaty, an agreement of mutual cooperation between the United States and New Granada that granted the US significant transit rights over the Isthmus of Panama, as well as military powers to suppress social conflicts and independence struggles targeted against New Granada. However this treaty would later be recalled by the US to justify American involvement in the Separation of Panama from Colombia. Vice Presidency (1855–1859) On 17 April 1854 General José María Melo y Ortiz deposed President José María Obando del Campo in a coup d'état. Later that year General Melo agreed to step down and handed power back to the previous administration; President Obando had been formally impeached by Congress so the Executive Power lay in the hands of Vice President José de Obaldía y Orejuela as Acting President as the New Granadian Constitution of 1832 did not allow for a full succession of power. The Constitution also prescribed for separate elections for President and Vice President set two years apart, so in 1855 when Vice President Obaldía's term came to an end Congress set out to elect his successor and elected Mallarino to succeed Obaldía. Mallarino took office as the 8th Vice President of New Granada on 1 April 1855 becoming Acting President of New Granada. In 1857 Mallarino handed Executive Power to the newly elected President, Mariano Ospina Rodríguez, who took office on 1 April; he then served out the remaining of his term as Ospina's Vice President until 1 April 1857. President Ospina set out to rewrite the Constitution, eliminating the Office of the Vice President among other substantial changes. Mallarino was thus the last Vice President of New Granada as he had no successor. The country would not have another Vice President until 1886 when the Colombian Constitution of 1886 reopened the Vice Presidency. Secretary of Foreign Affairs (1861) In 1861 Mallarino was tapped again to serve as Secretary of Foreign Affairs, this time appointed by President Bartolomé Calvo Díaz during the Civil War of 1860–1862. For this reason when Mallarino took office on 1 April 1861 as the 2nd Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Granadine Confederation he only served until 10 July, when General Mosquera, under whose Administration he had served as Secretary of Foreign Affairs in the past, deposed President Calvo and toppled the Government.

Stability calculations focus on centers of gravity, centers of buoyancy, the metacenters of vessels, and on how these interact.  History  A model yacht being tested in the towing tank of Newcastle University Ship stability, as it pertains to naval architecture, has been taken into account for hundreds of years. Historically, ship stability calculations relied on rule of thumb calculations, often tied to a specific system of measurement. Some of these very old equations continue to be used in naval architecture books today. However, the advent of calculus-based methods of determining stability, particularly Pierre Bouguer's introduction of the concept of the metacenter in the 1740s ship model basin, allow much more complex analysis. Master shipbuilders of the past used a system of adaptive and variant design. Ships were often copied from one generation to the next with only minor changes; by replicating stable designs, serious problems were usually avoided. Ships today still use this process of adaptation and variation; however, computational fluid dynamics, ship model testing and a better overall understanding of fluid and ship motions has allowed much more analytical design. Transverse and longitudinal waterproof bulkheads were introduced in ironclad designs between 1860 and the 1880s, anti-collision bulkheads having been made compulsory in British steam merchant ships prior to 1860.From Warrior to Dreadnought by D.K. Brown, Chatham Publishing (June 1997) Before this, a hull breach in any part of a vessel could flood its entire length. Transverse bulkheads, while expensive, increase the likelihood of ship survival in the event of hull damage, by limiting flooding to the breached compartments they separate from undamaged ones. Longitudinal bulkheads have a similar purpose, but damaged stability effects must be taken into account to eliminate excessive heeling. Today, most ships have means to equalize water in sections port and starboard (cross flooding), which helps limit structural stresses and changes to the ship's heel and/or trim. Add-on stability systems Add-on stability systems are designed to reduce the effects of waves and wind gusts. They do not increase a vessel's stability in calm seas. The International Maritime Organization International Convention on Load Lines does not cite active stability systems as a method of ensuring stability. The hull must be stable without active systems. =Passive systems= Bilge keel A bilge keel A bilge keel is a long, often V-shaped metal fin welded along the length of the ship at the turn of the bilge. Bilge keels are employed in pairs (one for each side of the ship). Rarely, a ship may have more than one bilge keel per side. Bilge keels increase hydrodynamic resistance when a vessel rolls, limiting the amount of roll. Outriggers Outriggers may be employed on vessels to reduce rolling, either by the force required to submerge buoyant floats or by hydrodynamic foils. In some cases, these outriggers are of sufficient size to classify the vessel as a trimaran; on other vessels, they may simply be referred to as stabilizers. Antiroll tanks Antiroll tanks are interior tanks fitted with baffles to slow the rate of water transfer from the tank's port side to its starboard side. It is designed so that a larger amount of water is trapped on the vessel's higher side. It is intended to have an effect counter to that of the free surface effect. Paravanes Paravanes may be employed by slow-moving vessels, such as fishing vessels, to reduce roll. =Active systems= Active stability systems, found on many vessels, require energy to be applied to the system in the form of pumps, hydraulic pistons, or electric actuators. They include stabilizer fins attached to the side of the vessel or tanks in which fluid is pumped around to counteract the vessel's motion. Stabilizer fins Active fin stabilizers reduce the roll a vessel experiences while underway or, more recently, while at rest. They extend beyond the vessel's hull below the waterline and alter their angle of attack depending on heel angle and the vessel's rate-of-roll, operating similarly to airplane ailerons. Cruise ships and yachts frequently use this type of stabilizing system. When fins are not retractable, they constitute fixed appendages to the hull, possibly extending the beam or draft envelope and requiring attention for additional hull clearance. While the typical \\"active fin\\" stabilizer effectively counteracts roll for ships underway, some modern active fin systems can reduce roll when vessels are not underway. Referred to as zero-speed, or Stabilization at Rest, these systems work by moving specially designed fins with sufficient acceleration and impulse timing to create effective roll-cancelling energy. Rudder Roll Stabilisation In case a ship is underway, a fast rudder change will not only initiate a heading change, but it will also cause the ship to roll. For some ships such as frigates, this effect is so large that it can be used by a control algorithm to simultaneously steer the ship while reducing its roll motions. Such a system is usually referred to as \\"Rudder Roll Stabilisation System\\". Its effectiveness can be as good as that of stabiliser fins. However, that depends on the ship speed (higher is better) and various ship design aspects such as position, size and quality of the rudder positioning system (behaves as fast as a stabiliser fin). Also important is how quickly the ship will respond to rudder motions with roll motions (quick is better) and rate of turn (slow is better). Despite the high costs of high-quality steering gear and strengthening of the ship's stern, this stabilisation option offers better economics than stabiliser fins. It requires fewer installations, is less vulnerable and it causes less drag. Even better, the required high-quality components provide excellent steering properties also for those periods when roll reduction is not required and a significant reduction of underwater noise. Known navy ships with this stabilisation solution are F124 (Germany), M-fregat and LCF (both of Dutch Navy). Gyroscopic internal stabilizers Gyroscopes were first used to control a ship's roll in the late 1920s and early 1930s for warships and then passenger liners. The most ambitious use of large gyros to control a ship's roll was on an Italian passenger liner, the SS Conte di Savoia, in which three large Sperry gyros were mounted in the forward part of the ship. While it proved successful in drastically reducing roll in the westbound trips, the system had to be disconnected on the eastbound leg for safety reasons. This was because with a following sea (and the deep slow rolls this generated) the vessel tended to 'hang' with the system turned on, and the inertia it generated made it harder for the vessel to right herself from heavy rolls. \\"Italian Liner To Defy The Waves\\" Popular Mechanics, April 1931 Gyro stabilizers consist of a spinning flywheel and gyroscopic precession that imposes boat-righting torque on the hull structure. The angular momentum of the gyro’s flywheel is a measure of the extent to which the flywheel will continue to rotate about its axis unless acted upon by an external torque. The higher the angular momentum, the greater the resisting force of the gyro to external torque (in this case more ability to cancel boat roll). A gyroscope has three axes: a spin axis, an input axis, and an output axis. The spin axis is the axis about which the flywheel is spinning and is vertical for a boat gyro. The input axis is the axis about which input torques are applied. For a boat, the principal input axis is the longitudinal axis of the boat since that is the axis around which the boat rolls. The principal output axis is the transverse (athwartship) axis about which the gyro rotates or precesses in reaction to an input. When the boat rolls, the rotation acts as an input to the gyro, causing the gyro to generate rotation around its output axis such that the spin axis rotates to align itself with the input axis. This output rotation is called precession and, in the boat case, the gyro will rotate fore and aft about the output or gimbal axis. Angular momentum is the measure of effectiveness for a gyro stabilizer, analogous to horsepower ratings on a diesel engine or kilowatts on a generator. In specifications for gyro stabilizers, the total angular momentum (moment of inertia multiplied by spin speed) is the key quantity. In modern designs, the output axis torque can be used to control the angle of the stabilizer fins (see above) to counteract the roll of the boat so that only a small gyroscope is needed. The idea for gyro controlling a ship's fin stabilizers was first proposed in 1932 by a General Electric scientist, Dr Alexanderson. He proposed a gyro to control the current to the electric motors on the stabilizer fins, with the actuating instructions being generated by thyratron vacuum tubes.\\"Fins Purposed For Big Liners To Prevent Rolling\\" Popular Mechanics, August 1932 Calculated stability conditions When a hull is designed, stability calculations are performed for the intact and damaged states of the vessel. Ships are usually designed to slightly exceed the stability requirements (below), as they are usually tested for this by a classification society. =Intact stability= Ship stability diagram showing centre of gravity (G), centre of buoyancy (B), and metacentre (M) with ship upright and heeled over to one side. As long as the load of a ship remains stable, G is fixed. For small angles M can also be considered to be fixed, while B moves as the ship heels. Intact stability calculations are relatively straightforward and involve taking all the centers of mass of objects on the vessel which are then computed/calculated to identify the center of gravity of the vessel, and the center of buoyancy of the hull. Cargo arrangements and loadings, crane operations, and the design sea states are usually taken into account. The diagram at the right shows the center of gravity is well above the center of buoyancy, yet the ship remains stable. The ship is stable because as it begins to heel, one side of the hull begins to rise from the water and the other side begins to submerge. This causes the center of buoyancy to shift toward the side that is lower in the water. The job of the naval architect is to make sure that the center of buoyancy shifts outboard of the center of gravity as the ship heels. A line drawn from the center of buoyancy in a slightly heeled condition vertically will intersect the centerline at a point called the metacenter. As long as the metacenter is further above the keel than the center of gravity, the ship is stable in an upright condition. =Damage stability (Stability in the damaged condition)= Damage stability calculations are much more complicated than intact stability. Software utilizing numerical methods are typically employed because the areas and volumes can quickly become tedious and long to compute using other methods. The loss of stability from flooding may be due in part to the free surface effect. Water accumulating in the hull usually drains to the bilges, lowering the centre of gravity and actually decreasing (It should read as increasing, since water will add as a bottom weight there by increasing GM) the metacentric height. This assumes the ship remains stationary and upright. However, once the ship is inclined to any degree (a wave strikes it for example), the fluid in the bilge moves to the low side. This results in a list. Stability is also lost in flooding when, for example, an empty tank is filled with seawater. The lost buoyancy of the tank results in that section of the ship lowering into the water slightly. This creates a list unless the tank is on the centerline of the vessel. In stability calculations, when a tank is filled, its contents are assumed to be lost and replaced by seawater. If these contents are lighter than seawater, (light oil for example) then buoyancy is lost and the section lowers slightly in the water accordingly. For merchant vessels, and increasingly for passenger vessels, the damage stability calculations are of a probabilistic nature. That is, instead of assessing the ship for one compartment failure, a situation where two or even up to three compartments are flooded will be assessed as well. This is a concept in which the chance that a compartment is damaged is combined with the consequences for the ship, resulting in a damage stability index number that has to comply with certain regulations. Required stability In order to be acceptable to classification societies such as the Bureau Veritas, American Bureau of Shipping, Lloyd's Register of Ships, Korean Register of Shipping and Det Norske Veritas, the blueprints of the ship must be provided for independent review by the classification society. Calculations must also be provided which follow a structure outlined in the regulations for the country in which the ship intends to be flagged. Within this framework different countries establish requirements that must be met. For U.S.-flagged vessels, blueprints and stability calculations are checked against the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations and International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea conventions (SOLAS). Ships are required to be stable in the conditions to which they are designed for, in both undamaged and damaged states. The extent of damage required to design for is included in the regulations. The assumed hole is calculated as fractions of the length and breadth of the vessel, and is to be placed in the area of the ship where it would cause the most damage to vessel stability. In addition, United States Coast Guard rules apply to vessels operating in U.S. ports and in U.S. waters. Generally these Coast Guard rules concern a minimum metacentric height or a minimum righting moment. Because different countries may have different requirements for the minimum metacentric height, most ships are now fitted with stability computers that calculate this distance on the fly based on the cargo or crew loading. There are many commercially available computer programs used for this task.

A crowded Line 1 tram during afternoon rush hour in 2012. Pyongyang Tram is a public tram system in Pyongyang, the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea). The first line of the current system opened in 1989. There are currently four lines in operation. Overview Before the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, there were three tramway systems in the entire Korean Peninsula: one each in Seoul, Busan and Pyongyang. However, the system in Pyongyang was discontinued after the war, largely due to the significant destruction of the city by US/UN bombing attacks. The remaining two in Seoul and Busan survived the war but were eventually discontinued too when motorcars became more common and a larger means of transport in South Korea in 1968, thus leaving no tramway networks on the peninsula. Unlike South Korea, personal ownership of automobiles in North Korea is very rare. North Koreans, especially those living in Pyongyang and other major cities, rely mainly on government-run public transport. Also, as the limited oil supply imported into the country is mostly allocated to its military (especially exemplified under Kim Jong-il's Songun (Military-First) policy), private vehicle ownership is virtually non-existent. In Pyongyang, there are electrically-powered trolleybuses (the Pyongyang trolleybus system) and subways (the Pyongyang Metro), with these two serving as its main forms of public transport. However, as trolleybus lines became gradually overcrowded, the city decided to re-open tram-lines. The first line was finally built and opened in 1989. In the late 1990s, the city had frequent power outages due to decrepit power stations and the lack of resources. The tram lines also suffered from outages, but the situation has improved in recent years. In 2003, however, the section of Line 1 between P'yŏngyang-yŏk and Songyo was closed, as the bridge over Taedong River started to decay, splitting Line 1 into two parts divided by the Taedong River. The section from Songyo to Songsin was eventually replaced by a trolleybus in 2014. In 2008, the City Transportation Company of Prague sold 20 used T3s to Pyongyang Public Transportation Enterprise together with a shipment of tram-rails. These trams were made in the late 1970s and the early 1980s. According to Ondřej Pečený, a spokesman for the City Transportation Company of Prague, these trams are in very good condition, and can run for at least two years without the need of a service. The tram cars were made by Tatra, a Czechoslovak company, during that nation's socialist era. Various types are used, but there are currently no low-floor tram cars. Foreign tourists were previously not permitted to ride the tram lines, but some recent tours have started to include tramway rides (though rides are not shared with locals and are instead chartered, unlike the Pyongyang Metro). Lines There are currently four lines in operation. *Line 1: P'yŏngyang-yŏk () -- Man'gyŏngdae () *Line 2: T'osŏng () -- Rangrang () -- Munsu () *Line 3: Sŏp'yŏngyang () -- Rangrang () *Kŭmsusan: Service to Kŭmsusan Palace of the Sun (no transfer to other lines) As of 2006, the fare is ₩5 for any section. There are also coupon tickets (; sinae ch'ap'yo). Rolling stock Prior to 2018, the rolling stock used were the Czechoslovakian ČKD Praha Tatra T6B5, Tatra T3, Tatra T4 and KT8D5K in either red/white livery or blue/white. The Kŭmsusan line uses VBZ Be 4/4 Type Ib rolling stock on a different gauge of 1,000 mm, rather than 1,435 mm for lines 1-3. In August 2018, following the introduction of new trolleybuses and metro cars, new partially domestically-produced tram cars were introduced in Pyongyang for the first time in decades. The cars were recently put to use on Line 1 and later Line 3. It is unclear how many new cars have been added to the line. The new domestically-produced tram vehicles add LED destination displays but do not appear to include air-conditioning. The trams were manufactured by Pyongyang's Bus Repair Factory named Tongil, assembled mostly, but not entirely, with domestic parts. A VBZ tram on the Kŭmsusan line in 2005.

Born William Chichester, he changed his surname to O'Neill in 1855. Background and education The eldest son of Reverend Edward Chichester, he was a member of the prominent Irish Chichester family headed by the Marquess of Donegall. He was the great-great-great-grandson of John Chichester, grandson of Edward Chichester, 1st Viscount Chichester, and younger brother of Arthur Chichester, 2nd Earl of Donegall. O'Neill was educated at Foyle College, Derry, Shrewsbury School and Trinity College, Dublin, and was ordained in 1837. Career He was a prominent church organist and composer of church music, glees and songs. When the Belfast Hospital for Sick Children was opened in 1878, Reverend O'Neill was appointed as the first president of the Medical Board. A marble dedication was installed in the hospitals surgical ward honouring him. This was a role he fulfilled with keen interest up until his death, at which time his son Robert Torrens took over the responsibility. In 1855 he succeeded to the substantial O'Neill estates on the death of his relative John O'Neill, 3rd Viscount O'Neill (on whose death the viscountcy became extinct) and assumed by Royal licence the surname of O'Neill in lieu of Chichester the same year. In 1868 the O'Neill title was revived when he was raised to the peerage as Baron O'Neill, of Shane's Castle in the County Antrim. Family Lord O'Neill married, firstly, Henrietta, daughter of Robert Torrens, judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland), and his wife Anne in 1839. After her death in 1857 he married, secondly, Elizabeth Grace, daughter of the Venerable John Torrens, Archdeacon of Dublin, in 1858; she was Henrietta's first cousin. His third son from his first marriage, Robert Torrens O'Neill, represented Antrim Mid in Parliament for many years. He died in April 1883, aged 70, and was succeeded in the barony by his eldest son from his first marriage, Edward. Two of Lord O'Neill's descendants gained particular distinction. His grandson Robert William Hugh O'Neill was Speaker of the Northern Ireland House of Commons and created Baron Rathcavan in 1953 while his great-grandson Terence O'Neill was Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and given a life peerage as Baron O'Neill of the Maine in 1970.

Chapel Hill, NC, University of North Carolina Press, 1939.Ira Clark, The Moral Art of Philip Massinger. Lewisburg, PA, Bucknell University Press, 1993. The play provides an interesting example of the treatment of the Roman Catholic sacrament of confession in English Renaissance theatre. Performance The Emperor of the East was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 11 March 1631. The play was performed by the King's Men at both of their theatres, the Blackfriars and the Globe; the company also acted the play at Court. Publication The play was published in quarto in 1632, printed by Thomas Harper for the bookseller John Waterson. Massinger dedicated the play to John Lord Mohun, Baron of Okehampton, one of his patrons. Mohun was the uncle of Massinger's friend Sir Aston Cockayne, who contributed a commendatory poem to the 1632 edition. Mohun was also the son-in-law of Lady Katherine Stanhope, to whom Massinger dedicated his play The Duke of Milan in 1623. Sources Massinger's primary source for the historical background of his plot was Sir Thomas Hawkins's The Holy Court (1626), a translation of Nicholas Caussin's La cour sainte.J. E. Gray, \\"The Source of The Emperor of the East,\\" Review of English Studies 1 (1950), pp. 126–35.Peter G. Phialas, \\"The Sources of Massinger's The Emperor of the East,\\" Publications of the Modern Language Association of America 65 (1950), pp. 473–82. The plot In the play, Massinger dramatises the Byzantine Emperor Theodosius II, his elder sister and regent Pulcheria, and his wife and empress Eudocia; specifically, he deals with Eudocia's rumoured infidelity with the courtier Paulinus. Since the play is a tragicomedy and therefore concludes with a happy ending, Masssinger resolves his plot difficulties by having Theodosius masquerade as clergy and hear his wife's confession, which convinces him that she is innocent of infidelity. Given that Massinger was reputedly a Catholic, it might be considered surprising that he would exploit such a plot device; yet his contemporary dramatist James Shirley, another reputed Catholic, employs the same trick of clerical disguise and sacrament violation in his later play The Gentleman of Venice (1639). The Emperor of the East is among the Massinger plays in which the influence of, and borrowing from, William Shakespeare is most abundant.Maxwell, p. 66.

Early life Brodien was born and raised in Chicago. At age 8, he took an interest in magic after a magician came to perform at his school. He never graduated high school and began working at age 14 selling and demonstrating magic tricks and novelties at the Magic Center in downtown Chicago. At age 16, Brodien worked at Chicago's Riverview Park, performing magic tricks. Brodien served in the Army during the 1950s at Fort Carson in Colorado and performed more than 700 shows while in the Army at hospitals, non-commissioned officers clubs and private parties. Career Brodien, who had been making semi-regular guest appearances performing magic tricks as himself on Bozo’s Circus since 1962, began appearing as a wizard character in an Arabian Nights-inspired costume in 1968 and evolved into Wizzo the Wizard by the early 1970s. He was billed as being from \\"Arobia\\" and possessed the magical Stone of Zanzabar. According to Brodien, the first time he touched Bozo (Bob Bell) with the stone, Bozo quipped: \\"I remember when you got stoned at the Zanzabar.\\" Oliver O. Oliver (Ray Rayner) left Bozo's Circus in 1971 and was briefly replaced by Pat Tobin as Oliver's cousin Elrod T. Potter, and then by magician John Thompson (an acquaintance of Brodien's) as Clod Hopper. By 1973, WGN gave up on Thompson and increased Brodien's appearances as Wizzo. Brodien left the program in 1994. In 1970, Brodien was the spokesperson and creator of a trick magic card deck known as TV Magic Cards, which was a renamed Svengali deck. The deck resembled a regular playing card deck, except that the cards could be shown as all the same card. Many other card tricks could be performed with the deck. Over 17 million decks of the cards were sold.ephemera: Marshall Brodien TV Magic Cards Brodien sold his company in 1992. Brodien had a car with vanity license plates reading \\"WIZ\\" and custom pin-striping which contained a tiny \\"WIZ\\" within the striping. Personal life Brodien designed magic trick sets for children through a company called Cadaco Toys. He occasionally made public appearances in the Chicago area, and a biography, The Magical Life Of Marshall Brodien, was published in 2007. One of his Wizzo costumes is in the WGN-TV Bozo's Circus exhibit at the Museum of Broadcast Communications. Brodien was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2007. In 2018, the mayor of Geneva, Illinois announced that July 10 would be known as “Marshall Brodien Day” in the city of Geneva. Brodien and his wife Mary had six children and stepchildren.

In particular a cycle of 18 texts studied by Amoghavajra, which included both Tattvasaṃgraha Tantra, and the Guhyasamaja Tantra, a Tibetan text which appears to be composed of two works grouped together and to further confuse matters in the Japanese Shingon school the is known by this name. In Tibetan it is considered to be the main representative of the Yogatantra class of texts. Outline The tantra begins with Vairocana Buddha preaching the Dharma to a great host of Bodhisattvas, including Vajrasattva, in the Pure Land of Akanishta. As he preaches the Dharma, Prince Sarvarthasiddhi, the esoteric name of the Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, is meditating under the Bodhi Tree. Enlightenment is imminent, but the Prince has still not attained it because he is still attached in some small way to his forsaken ascetic practices. Despairing over his inability to find Enlightenment, he is visited by Buddhist figures who were just now learning the Dharma from Vairocana. These same deities proceed to teach him a more direct path to Enlightenment through tantric ritual. The tantra then details the rituals used to actualize the Dharma. These rituals help forming the basis of tantric ritual in Shingon Buddhism, including such practices as meditating upon the full moon and the use of certain mantras. This tantra also introduces the Diamond Realm Mandala as a focus for meditative practices, and its use in the abhiseka ritual of initiation. As the prince has now experienced Enlightenment, he ascends to Mount Sumeru and constructs the Diamond Realm Mandala and initiates and converts the bodhisattvas gathered there, one by one, into tantric deities who constitute the Mandala. In tantric ritual, the teacher assumes the role of the Prince who constructs the Mandala, while the master and student repeat specific mantras in a form of dialogue. The student, who is blindfolded, then throws a flower upon the Mandala that is constructed, and where it lands (i.e. which deity) helps dictate where the student should focus his devotion on the tantric path. From there, the student's blindfold is removed and a vajra is placed in hand.

Background  Dou Wei was from Fufeng Commandery (扶風, roughly modern Baoji, Shaanxi). His father Dou Chi (竇熾) served as a high-level official for both Northern Zhou and Sui and was a hereditary noble. Dou Wei was considered quiet and studious in his youth, much unlike his brothers and cousins who, as nobles, were far more interested in military matters. The Sui official Li Delin knew of his talent and recommended him as a junior official at the Palace Library, but while it was regular for junior officials there to be promoted regularly, Dou was not promoted, and remained at his post for more than a decade, during which he studied the archives and became even more knowledgeable than before.  During the Sui dynasty  Dou later served as a scribe for Yang Xiu the Prince of Shu, a son of Sui's founding emperor Emperor Wen, but when he saw that Yang Xiu was engaging in improper behavior, he resigned, and subsequently when Emperor Wen discovered Yang Xiu's improper deeds in 602 and subsequently deposed him, many of Yang Xiu's subordinates were punished, but Dou escaped punishment. In 608, during the reign of Emperor Wen's son Emperor Yang, he became a senior official at the legislative bureau (內史省, Neishi Sheng), but as he often pointed out problems with Emperor Yang's governance, he offended Emperor Yang and was demoted to be the director of civil service matters (考功郎中, Kaogong Langzhong), and subsequently was removed from governmental office altogether. In 617, the general Li Yuan the Duke of Tang rebelled and captured the capital Chang'an, declaring Emperor Yang's grandson Yang You the Prince of Dai emperor (as Emperor Gong). Li Yuan's deceased wife Duchess Dou was a niece of Dou Wei's, and Li Yuan, who retained power as regent, retained Dou on staff. At that time, the government was in a state of flux, and with Dou being knowledgeable with ceremonies and governmental organization, Li Yuan entrusted to him the task of reorganizing the government as well as preparing the ceremonies to have Yang You yield the throne to Li Yuan. Li Yuan compared him to the Han Dynasty official Shusun Tong (叔孫通), who organized the ceremonies for Emperor Gao of Han.  During the Tang dynasty  In spring 618, Emperor Yang was killed during a coup at Jiangdu (江都, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) led by the general Yuwen Huaji, and when the news reached Chang'an, Li Yuan had Yang You yield the throne to him, establishing Tang Dynasty as its Emperor Gaozu. He made Dou Wei the head of the legislative bureau (內史令, Neishi Ling), considered one of the posts for a chancellor. Dou became ill later that month and died. Emperor Gaozu posthumously created him the Duke of Yan'an.  References  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 61. * New Book of Tang, vol. 95. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 184, 185.

He was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Miami on September 17, 1976 and succeeded Coleman Francis Carroll as Archbishop of Miami on July 26, 1977. Archbishop McCarthy retired as Archbishop on November 3, 1994. He died on June 7, 2005 at the age of 87. Background Archbishop McCarthy was ordained a priest in 1943 within the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, graduating from Saint Gregory Seminary and Mt. Saint Mary Seminary in Norwood, Ohio. His education included a master's degree in Philosophy from the Athenaeum of Ohio. He earned a Doctor of Canon Law degree, or J.C.D. in 1947 and a Doctor of Sacred Theology degree, or S.T.D. in 1948 while in Rome, Italy at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum. His dissertation was entitled \\"Epiky: a theoretical study of the virtue of epiky and its use, along with a historical review of the development of the doctrine on this subject\\". He also has a high school named after him. During his service within the Diocese of Cincinnati he served as the secretary to two Archbishops, judge in the marriage tribunal and chairman of numerous diocesan committees. Episcopacy McCarthy was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Cincinnati by Pope Paul VI on April 21, 1965. He was consecrated two months later on June 15, 1965 with Cincinnati Archbishop Karl Joseph Alter serving as Principal Consecrator. After four years as an Auxiliary Bishop of Cincinnati, McCarthy was appointed the first Bishop of the newly created Diocese of Phoenix on August 25, 1969. He was installed as Bishop of Phoenix on December 2 of that year. On September 17, 1976, McCarthy was appointed the Coadjutor Archbishop of Miami due to the failing health of Archbishop Coleman F. Carroll. Upon Archbishop Carroll's death on July 26, 1977, McCarthy succeeded him as the second Archbishop of Miami. Archbishop McCarthy would transform and affect almost every aspect of life within the Archdiocese of Miami. Soon after arriving, he would oversee the construction of a Pastoral Center for the diocese and restructure most senior operational divisions. He would establish the Office of Lay Ministry, the Office of Evangelization and the Permanent Diaconate program. In 1980, he was a key figure in offering support and assistance during the Mariel Boat Lift. A year later, he stood up for the rights of Haitian immigrants who were detained under what would become known as the Wet Foot, Dry Foot policy. In response to these incidents, that same year he oversaw the opening of the Pierre Toussaint Haitian Catholic Center in Miami. However, he was also picketed by Haitian-born Roman Catholic priest Gérard Jean-Juste, who criticized him for not doing more for Haitian refugees and attributed McCarthy's alleged indifference to racism. As punishment, Jean- Juste was forbidden by his church superiors from performing mass in the area. In 1984, he assisted with the transition of the Archdiocese when the Diocese of Venice and Diocese of Palm Beach were established from annexed counties. A year later, he would call for the first ever Archdiocesan Synod. Lasting until 1988, it was seen as a method to revitalize the faithful within the Archdiocese. Pope John Paul II visited Miami in 1987. For the first time he was forced to halt his public Mass midway due to a massive thunderstorm. Severe lightning caused the liturgy to be suspended due to safety concerns—an event that had never occurred elsewhere during the Pope's travels. The Pontiff completed the offering of the Mass inside a trailer, as the crowds dispersed, but only after McCarthy pleaded with them to tend to their own safety. In 1993, Archbishop McCarthy submitted his resignation at the mandatory retirement age of 75. He became officially retired on November 3, 1994. During his tenure, South Florida underwent a population boom. The Archbishop oversaw the development and foundation of many new churches. In his final year, he started the planning on a new parish and high school in western Broward County. The church, authorized in 1994 and founded two months after his retirement in 1995, bore his namesake...Saint Edward. The school would be completed in 1997, with current Archbishop John C. Favalora having the facility named in honor of the man that had made it possible, therefore it was named Archbishop Edward A. McCarthy High School. Archbishop Edward A.

Life and career Born in Scarborough, Yorkshire, England, Hunter also appeared in first-class cricket for Lord Hawke's XI (1889), North of England (1889–1907), L Hall's XI (1889), Players (1890–1909), Hurst Park Club (1890), L Hall's Yorkshire XI (1891), XI of Yorkshire (1894), Over 30 (1901), CI Thornton's XI (1902–1905), Lancashire and Yorkshire (1903–1909), Rest of England (1904) and Lord Londesborough's XI (1909). In 552 matches in total, he took 913 catches and completed 350 stumpings. A modest right-handed tailend batsman, he compiled 4,538 runs at an average of 12.03, with a best of 58 not out against Worcestershire. Over the years, he held up his end in stands of 53, 148, 121, 118 and 102 for the tenth wicket. He did bowl 42 balls as well, conceding 43 runs and not taking a wicket. He succeeded his brother Joe Hunter as the Yorkshire wicket-keeper at the relatively late age of 28, but was then an almost ever present player for the following two decades. It is a testament to his 'good hands' that he never suffered a serious finger injury, nor were his hands damaged at the end of his career, despite the comparatively crude equipment and heavy workload of the time. In Louis Hall's benefit match against Surrey at Sheffield in 1891, he caught five men and stumped one in an innings, and against the same county seven years later, claimed eight of the twenty wickets, catching two and stumping six at Bradford. He was a doughty performer right up to the end of his career, making six catches in an innings, again against Surrey, at Headingley in his last year. He helped Yorkshire win the County Championship eight times, and received £1,975 from his benefit in the Roses match against Lancashire at Bradford in 1897. Hunter died in January 1927 in Northstead, Scarborough, at the age of 66.

Population: The district extends northeast from Kitai-gorod, within the radial boundaries of Vorontsovo Pole Street and Yauza River in the south and Myasnitskaya Street and Novaya Basmannaya Street in the north. It also includes the territory of Lefortovo Hospital on the opposite, southern bank of Yauza (between the river and Gospitalny Val Street). Historical Lefortovskaya Square also lies within Basmanny District, on the northern side of Yauza. The district contains Kursky Rail Terminal, historical areas of Khitrovka, Clean Ponds, Red Gates (shared with Krasnoselsky District), German Quarter and Basmannaya Sloboda. It retains memorial buildings of Petrine Baroque, Neoclassicism and Art Nouveau periods. Its history is closely associated with Peter I of Russia, Matvey Kazakov and Alexander Pushkin. The district is home to Russia's largest engineering college, Moscow State Technical University. History and architecture =Kitai-gorod to Garden Ring= Apraksin- Trubetskoy Palace Central part of the district, with radial Myasnitskaya Street, Pokrovka Street and Solyanka Street, was gradually urbanized since the 15th century. Central street, known as Maroseika and Pokrovka, was part of a royal route to country estates in Izmailovo and hosted court gardens and nobility; by 1638, 62 of 83 households belonged to upper classes (Sytin, p. 103). At the same time, it was popular among foreigners; however, in 1643 the Church persuaded Tsar Alexey to limit foreign presence and by 1652 all Catholics and Lutherans had to relocate to German Quarter, 2-3 kilometers north-west on the same route. Most of the area burnt down in the Fire of 1812 and was rebuilt in neoclassical style. Notable 18th-century buildings include Menshikov Tower, a unique Petrine Baroque church that rivalled Ivan the Great Bell Tower in height, and late Baroque Apraksin-Trubetskoy palace (22, Pokrovka Street). Church in former Khitrov Market Date of foundation of Ivanovsky Convent (4, Zabelina Street) remains unknown; it was used as a high security prison for state prisoners like Maria Shuiskaya, wife of deposed Vasili IV of Russia, and Darya Saltykova. Present-day cathedral and towers were built by Mikhail Bykovsky in 1861. Nearby Moscow Choral Synagogue (10, Bolshoy Spasoglinischevsky Lane) was completed in 1906. Armyansky Lane, in the beginning of Pokrovka Street, has been a hub of Moscow's Armenian community since the late 18th century, starting as the base of Lazarev merchant family of Armenian descent. Lazarev's Institute of Oriental Languages, founded in 1814, has been an official school for Russian diplomats since 1827; today, its neoclassical building houses the embassy of Armenia. Nearby Maly Zlatoustinsky Lane was home to Matvey Kazakov's home and workshop (recently demolished). The Egg House in Mashkova Street, a 1998 design by Sergey Tkachenko, lists for 7 million US Dollars Southern end of central Basmanny District hides the infamous Khitrovka - former \\"bottom of Moscow\\" between present-day Pokrovsky Boulevard, Khokhlovsky Lane and Solyanka Street. Khitrov market, set up in the 1820s, became a flophouse district in the 1860s and a gang land by the 1880s, concentrating thousands of former peasants who failed to adjust to city life. Many original buildings of Khitrovka still stand, although the market and the infamous flophouses were replaced college buildings. In Soviet period, reconstruction of Basmanny District lagged behind that of western districts. In the 1930s, Basmanny lost landmarks like Red Gates and Assumption Church in Pokrovka, but overall city fabric remains unchanged, with an irregular maze of lanes and two-story historical buildings. Apartment buildings on the boulevards, instead of demolition, were expanded in depth and height, retaining original finishes. =Basmannaya Sloboda= St. Peter and Paul, built to a drawing by Tsar Peter the Great \\"Basman\\" in the 17th century referred to a particular sort of bread supplied to the court and troops, however, historians argue that Basmannaya sloboda was too large for bakers alone. This sloboda occupied the beginning of Staraya Basmannaya Street, while the present-day Novaya Basmannaya Street was known as Kapitanskaya (Captain's) sloboda and housed the officers of \\"European\\" troops established by Peter I. Church of St. Peter and Paul in this area was built in 1705–1723 to the draft made by Peter himself, in early Baroque style (the church technically stands in Krasnoselsky District). Previous rulers travelled to their country estates via Staraya Basmannaya, however, Peter changed this habit in favor of Novaya Basmannaya, adding to the popularity of this street among the nobles. In the middle of the 18th century, when nobility was relieved from compulsory service, both streets were redeveloped with suburban estates of families like Rumyantsevs and Golitsyns. In the 1750s, they commissioned Dmitry Ukhtomsky to build the extant church of Martyr Nikita, the largest example of Baroque architecture in Moscow. St. Nikita in Staraya Basmannaya Street The area burnt down in 1812; some homeowners rebuilt their lots in stone, while others could allow only wooden buildings. Vasily Pushkin, uncle of Alexander Pushkin, owned such single-story wooden house at 36, Staraya Basmannaya. The poet himself was born in nearby Malaya Pochtovaya Street (exact location of his birthplace remains disputed and was previously stated as either 40 or 57, Baumanskaya Street). In the 1900s-1910s, both streets acquired 5-7 storey apartment buildings in Art Nouveau and Neoclassical Revival styles. Most notable is 15, Staraya Basmannaya by Vasily Schaub with Fyodor Schechtel artwork and clear Vienna Secession features, built to order of Moscow's only Persian property developer (Naschokina, p. 432). In Soviet period, most of this architecture survived, excluding the blocks near the Garden Ring, which now house Ivan Fomin's constructivist \\"Tank Engine Building\\" (Ministry of Railways). =German Quarter= Lefortovskaya Square, hub of former German Quarter Original German Quarter emerged between present-day Baumanskaya Street and Lefortovskaya Square in the late 16th century and was repopulated with Europeans of all nations after 1652, becoming then known as New German sloboda. By 1672, it had three Lutheran and two Calvinist churches (Sytin, p. 310) and numerous factories. Tsar Peter, who grew up in nearby sloboda behind Yauza River, was a frequent guest in this settlement and built a palace for Franz Lefort (which later passed to Alexander Menshikov). The palace currently housed military archives. Present-day old hall of Moscow State Technical University, established in 1830, incorporated this palace, as well as former Alexander Bezborodko palace rebuilt by Domenico Giliardi. Ascension Church in Kazakov Street After the fire of 1812, property changed owners, and by 1826 foreigners virtually disappeared from the former German Street (present-day Baumanskaya Street), replaced by local merchants and craftsmen. The district quickly industrialized, especially after Emancipation reform of 1861. Notable additions in the Soviet period were the TsAGI buildings in Radio Street and the numerous expansions of Technical University. In the late 1990s, the area became the site of Lefortovo tunnel construction, completing the Third Ring freeway. February 23, 2006, a roof of Baumansky market in the center of German Quarter collapsed, killing 56. The land, cleared of rubble, is still vacant, used for storing impounded cars.

The building is red brick on a raised limestone foundation. The hospital is a winged building, consisting of a 9-story, red brick center tower block flanked by matching 5-story blocks, threaded together by a central corridor expressed in two thin 7-story connectors. The main facade is oriented towards Sixth Street. A 1948 3-story addition to the north is set back, fronting the alley. Together the three blocks and their corridors form a back-to-back \\"E\\" configuration in plan and a soaring prospect in elevation. The Neoclassical Revival styled building are an example of institutional design reflected in certain features including its \\"large-scale massing, rectangular multi-unit plan with connecting corridors, central pavilion featuring entry porch with Ionic columns and full entablature, limestone belt coursing and trim, repetitive fenestration, stone cornice, and flat roofs.\\" The former hospital is built up to its east and west property lines with park-like courtyards between the projecting blocks.

They were respected and renowned for their art and education in the classics, and were hired to perform to both male and female clients, as well as employed by the state. Though yiji could in individual cases choose to sell sexual favors to a client, this was not a part of her profession as a yiji, but a parallel favor outside of their profession as a yiji and regarded as separated from it. After the establishment of the Qing dynasty in 1644, however, the Yiji was banned from being employed by the state. This made them dependent of the patronage of private clients, which resulted in the development of the profession to prostitution, as male clients started to demand sexual favors in exchange for patronage. A yiji could come from various backgrounds, but a common background was that of a slave girl in a brothel: the girl was then taken from the brothel and educated in the arts of being a courtesan. The yiji could earn substantial fortunes, however, they were often caught in debt to former associates and, as they lacked families, were often exposed to ruinous lawsuits. When the yiji retired, she often educated her own daughter to be her successor, or selected a student to be so.

It starts off just west of Longwood Road South and east of Highway 403 as a two-way thoroughfare up to Queen Street South, where it then switches over to a one-way collector road (eastbound) to Bay Street South and then to another two-way section from Bay Street to James Mountain Road, a mountain-access road in the city near the base of the Niagara Escarpment (mountain). History Aberdeen Avenue was named after Lord Aberdeen (John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair) and Lady Aberdeen (Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair) who both lived in Hamilton on Bay Street South (1890-1898) with their four children. They presided over the opening of the Hamilton Public Library on September 16, 1890. Lord Aberdeen was appointed Governor General of Canada in 1893. right Historically, the Durand neighbourhood along Markland Street and Aberdeen Avenue, east of Queen Street, was home to the 'industrialists'. This south of downtown neighbourhood is quite possibly the largest concentration of early 20th-century castles/mansions in Canada. The grand homes were home to the families whose names graced the signs of the north end factories and made their fortunes in transportation, finance and industry. A McMaster University research campus called McMaster Innovation Park is currently being developed on the former Camco lands near Westdale. This will be an \\"idea factory\\" employing scientists and technicians. CANMET will employ 100 research scientists and support workers, including some of the top minds in Canada and will be the anchor tenant of the facility. They will be working closely with McMaster researchers and private industry to develop technologies for metal and materials manufacturing, processing and evaluation. Expected to be up-and-running by 2010. Other tenants already announced for the park include a corrosion research centre sponsored by General Motors and a diesel engine research lab sponsored by Ford.

The Aberdeen Avenue bridge which was constructed in 1963, was found to have advanced deterioration including on the deck, bridge containment, and non-performing bearings by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO). The MTO decided to go with a rapid bridge replacement process, replacing the entire Aberdeen Avenue bridge deck in a weekend instead of taking the usual nine to twelve months to complete it. Reasons for the decision included minimizing disruptions to the travelling public, improved construction safety and reduced construction costs. MTO retained the engineering and management firm Morrison Hershfield as lead consultant for this exciting and innovative project. The rapid bridge replacement process began the evening of July 30, 2010. Using innovative technology the old bridge was lifted away and replaced with a pre-constructed bridge that was built nearby. The process was completed on August 3, 2010. Dufferin Construction Company successfully executed the complete replacement. This project was the first time rapid replacement technology has been used over a major highway in Southern Ontario. It is also part of a larger project to repair or replace eight bridges along Highway 403 in Hamilton. This $35.8 million investment is expected to create or sustain approximately 415 jobs as part of the Ontario Open plan. On February 26, 2011, the Hamilton/Halton Engineering Week committee selected the Ontario Ministry of Transportation, Morrison Hershfield and Dufferin Construction team as the recipients of the 2011 Project of the Year in the Civil Engineering category for the Highway 403/ Aberdeen Avenue Rapid Bridge Replacement.

She was married to the historian Manning Clark.Jones, Philip (May 2000) Dymphna Clark obituary, theguardian.com; accessed 6 June 2015. Born in Melbourne of Swedish and Flemish ancestry, Clark was educated at Mont Albert Central School and the Presbyterian Ladies' College in East Melbourne. Her father was Augustin Lodewyckx, the Associate Professor of Germanic languages at Melbourne University, and her mother – Anna Sophia (née Hansen) – also taught Swedish at Melbourne University. Clark finished Presbyterian Ladies College early (aged 15) and spent time at school in Munich, with her mother, in 1933. Returning to Melbourne, she studied languages to honours level at Melbourne University, where she met Manning Clark. In 1938, she travelled to Bonn on a scholarship to undertake doctoral studies in German literature. She was there when Kristallnacht occurred, and left soon after with the increasing threat of war. She met Manning Clark in Oxford, marrying him there on 31 January 1939, and they ultimately had six children. She taught at Blundell's School in Devon in the first year of her marriage and they returned to Australia in 1940. Clark became a distinguished linguist and translator, fluent in eight languages and able to speak another four. She lectured in German at the Australian National University in Canberra. Her translations included the botanist Charles von Hugel's New Holland Journals and, with Peter Sack, the German reports of the Governor of German New Guinea from 1886 to 1914. She also worked on her husband's projects, undertaking editing and research. She established Manning Clark House (Dympha and Manning's own house from 1953), and was heavily involved in the Aboriginal Treaty Committee (1979–1983); it was she who drafted the Council's preamble for review by Parliament.MCH-Manning & Dymphna Clark short biography Since 2002 the Dymphna Clark Memorial Lecture has been given in her honour.

Background  It is unknown when Yang Gongren was born. He was the oldest son of Yang Xiong (楊雄), a distant nephew of Sui Dynasty's founder Emperor Wen, who was considered one of the four most powerful officials at one point early in Sui, with Gao Jiong, Yu Qingze (虞慶則), and Su Wei and who was created an imperial prince with various titles, eventually the title of Prince of Guan.  During Sui Dynasty  Late in the reign of Emperor Wen (some time between 601 and 604), Yang Gongren became the governor of Gan Province (甘州, roughly modern Zhangye, Gansu). It was said that he had a good grasp on general governance and intentionally refused to dwell on details, and that in doing so comforted the non-Han residents of the province. It was said that Emperor Wen told his father Yang Xiong, \\"Gongren governs the province well. It is not only that I selected the right person, but because you have taught him in the ways of righteousness.\\" Early in the reign of Emperor Wen's son Emperor Yang, Yang Gongren was the assistant minister of civil service matters. When the general Yang Xuangan rebelled in 613, Yang Gongren was one of the generals Emperor Yang sent against Yang Xuangan, and he participated in destroying Yang Xuangan. He received great praise from both Emperor Yang and Su Wei. However, it was said at the time that the matters of civil service were being controlled by Su, Yuwen Shu, Pei Yun (裴蘊), and Pei Ju, and that they were largely corrupt. Yang Gongren was considered honest and was not tolerated by Pei Yun, and therefore was instead commissioned to lead the army against agrarian rebels in the modern Hunan region. He was, however, defeated by the rebel general Zhu Can at Qiao Commandery (譙郡, roughly modern Bozhou, Anhui), and forced to flee to Emperor Yang's then-location at Jiangdu (江都, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). In spring 618, the general Yuwen Huaji killed Emperor Yang in a coup and declared Emperor Yang's nephew Yang Hao the Prince of Qin emperor. While he killed a large number of high level officials and imperial Yang clan members, he did not kill Yang Gongren and made Yang Gongren the minister of civil service matters. After Yuwen advanced north of the elite Xiaoguo Army (驍果) but was defeated by Li Mi, he headed further north, and he left Yang Gongren defending Wei (魏縣, in modern Handan, Hebei). In 619, the Tang official Wei Zheng, however, persuaded another official Yuwen left at Wei, Yuan Baozang (元寶藏), to seize Yang Gongren and submit to Emperor Gaozu of Tang. Yuan delivered Yang Gongren to the Tang capital Chang'an. As Emperor Gaozu, while a Sui official, was a friend of Yang Gongren's, he released Yang Gongren and made him the assistant head of the examination bureau of the government (門下省, Mengxia Sheng) and created him the Duke of Guan.  During Emperor Gaozu's reign  Emperor Gaozu soon made Yang Gongren the commandant at Liang Prefecture (涼州, roughly modern Wuwei, Gansu), because of his familiarity with the region. Yang was able to govern effectively, and it was said that tribes east of the Pamir Mountains were all nominally submitting to Tang as a result. At times, when Eastern Tujue forces attacked, he was able to repel them, but his own territory nevertheless suffered losses from Eastern Tujue raids. In winter 619, Yang was nominally given the title of Nayan (納言) -- the title for the head of the examination bureau, one considered as a post for a chancellor, but it was also explicitly stated that he did not actually take on the responsibilities of Nayan, but remained at Liang Prefecture. In 623, Emperor Gaozu recalled Yang to Chang'an to be Zhongshu Ling (中書令), the head of the legislative bureau of government, considered to be a chancellor post as well. He also was made the minister of civil service affairs. He also continued to nominally serve as the commandant at Liang Prefecture. In 626, Emperor Gaozu's son Li Shimin the Prince of Qin, in an intense rivalry with his brother Li Jiancheng the Crown Prince, ambushed Li Jiancheng and another brother, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi (who supported Li Jiancheng) at Xuanwu Gate and killed them, and then effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to create him crown prince. He also took effective rein of the government and reorganized it. As part of the reorganization, Yang was removed from his posts, but remained a general.  During Emperor Taizong's reign  Two months later, Emperor Gaozu yielded the throne to Li Shimin, who became emperor (as Emperor Taizong). He initially made Yang Gongren to be the governor of the capital prefecture Yong Prefecture (雍州), and then made him the assistant to the commandant at Yang Prefecture (揚州, roughly modern Yangzhou) -- Emperor Taizong's favorite son Li Tai the Prince of Yue. (As Li Tai did not actually report to Yang Prefecture, Yang Gongren was effectively commandant.) In 631, he became the commandant at Luo Prefecture (洛州, roughly modern Luoyang, Henan), an important location as the effective eastern capital. At a later point, he retired, although the year of his retirement was not clear. It was said at this time that Yang Gongren was humble and courteous, even to people who were below him in rank, and was compared to the humble Han Dynasty chancellor Shi Qing (石慶). His clan became an honored one, as his younger brother Yang Shidao married Emperor Gaozu's daughter Princess Guiyang; his niece was wife and princess of Li Yuanji and later became a favorite concubine of Emperor Taizong; and his nephew Yang Sijing (楊思敬) married another daughter of Emperor Gaozu, the Princess Anping. Yang died in 639. He was given posthumous honored and buried near the tomb of Emperor Taizong's wife Empress Zhangsun, which would eventually become Emperor Taizong's tomb as well.

He was sent by the Bishop of London in 1764 to be a missionary in Trinity Bay, Newfoundland, where he discovered a rowdy community sometimes reluctant to receive his ministry—he frequently complained in letters of the \\"barbarous lawless place,\\" where music and dancing were engaged in on Sunday, fights (particularly between English and Irish) and break-ins were commonplace, and where common-law marriage was a frequent practice. In March 1769 he was even assaulted, seemingly at random. Nevertheless, Balfour eventually managed to make considerable headway in increasing the size of his congregation and in raising money to repair the local church. In October 1775 he finally persuaded the superiors at the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel to transfer him to Harbour Grace. He was not much better received there, as the town was largely Catholic and Presbyterian and Quaker, and the congregation also wished for a younger minister. William Lampen, the schoolmaster, wrote to the SPG, complaining that the minister was drinking heavily and rarely conducted services. Both Lampen and Balfour were dismissed, and Balfour lived on his salary as a pension until his death.

Rugby Annual, NSWRU Mosman played its first match on 26 May 1894 against 'Union', a junior club from inner-Sydney, and finished its inaugural season in 7th place with four wins and five losses.NSWRU Annual 1894 One of Mosman's foundation players was Denis 'Dinny' Lutge who would become Mosman's only dual rugby international. After joining North Sydney in 1900 he played in Australia's inaugural Rugby Union test against New Zealand in August 1903 and three tests against the visiting Great Britain side in 1904.Pollard, Jack (1994). Australian Rugby Union: The Game and the Players, Ironbark In 1908 Lutge joined the switch to Rugby League and played against New Zealand in Australia's first official Rugby League series. When the first Kangaroos were selected to visit Great Britain in 1908–09, he was elected tour captain by the players.Heads, Ian (1990). The Kangaroos: The Saga of Rugby League's Great Tours, Lester-Townsend Publishing Sydney's sub-districts rugby (now known as the New South Wales Suburban Rugby Union or Subbies) gained its first major trophy in 1923, when W. H. Kentwell, then president of Mosman Rugby, presented the Kentwell Cup. Eight teams competed in that first Kentwell Cup, with Mosman the winner. It remains the trophy of Subbies First Division. In 1924, Mosman's vice-president, James A. Burke, presented the Burke Cup for subdistricts second graders.Jack Pollard, Australian Rugby Union the Game and the Players, Angus & Robertson, 1984; p. 524. Recent developments Since its foundation Mosman has competed at a high level in many different competitions and grades but has always valued a balance between playing success and mateship and camaraderie off the field. In 1989 the Club embarked on its most ambitious project, the refurbishment of its home ground facilities at Rawson Park. This required a huge effort on the part of the Committee of the day - dealing with Local Council and State and Federal Governments of different political persuasions proved interesting. Four years and $500,000 later, and with the help of Mosman Council and Telecom, the doors to the Clubhouse were opened on 26 September 1992. In 2019, Mosman fielded seven grade teams and 3 Colts teams (Under 21s) in the NSW Suburban Rugby Union's 1st Division as well as 35 junior teams. Registrations in general represent over 200 grade players, 80 colts players and over 450 juniors drawn predominantly from the local area.

Dellview Road, the community's only paved road, forms the town's northern border. North of it lies the town of Cherryville. History Dellview was incorporated as a town in 1925 as a political gesture. Gaston County law prohibited the shooting of stray dogs that crossed onto a citizen's land. The law was disliked by two families of the Dellinger name, who were both poultry farmers. They complained that stray dogs were raiding their chicken coops on their farms, which neighbored each other. To remedy the situation, the Dellingers petitioned fellow kinsman David R. Dellinger, who was a North Carolina state representative, to propose a bill to the General Assembly for incorporating the Dellinger's farms into a town known as \\"Dellview\\" (the clipped form of Dellinger merged with the word \\"view\\"). The bill passed, formally incorporating the town in 1925. Immediately thereafter, the town leaders passed an ordinance allowing for the citizens to shoot any stray dog that crosses onto their property. No one for Dellview responded to a Census Mapping Survey in 1978, and as a result, the town was declared inactive, and thereby the governing rights were transferred fully back to Gaston County. In 1980, the decision was reversed after a citizen petitioned, but the town was declared inactive once again on the Census 2000.Census.gov : Geographic Boundary Changes (37 North Carolina) For many years, the town of Dellview enjoyed the distinction of being the smallest incorporated community in the state.

Keating was Prime Minister between 1991 and 1996; the musical follows him from his ascent to the leadership through to his eventual electoral defeat by John Howard. It was written by Casey Bennetto, who was inspired to write the show by his disappointment at the results of the 2004 federal election, which saw Howard's Coalition government returned for a fourth term. The musical takes a humorous, satirical tone and presents a positive image of Keating while frequently criticising the Howard government. Bennetto describes the show as \\"ridiculously pro-Paul Keating\\". Originally performed by musical group the Drowsy Drivers, the show achieved rapid success from its low-budget premiere at the 2005 Melbourne International Comedy Festival where it enjoyed a sold- out run and won an unprecedented three festival awards. In 2006, Neil Armfield directed an extended Company B production of Keating!, now with two acts and six new songs written by Bennetto. The Company B production toured Australia, receiving favourable reviews and winning Helpmann Awards for Best Musical and Best Regional Touring Production. In 2008 a live recording of the show was broadcast nationally on ABC2; it was released on DVD in November 2008, through Madman Entertainment. Background Paul Keating was the Labor Prime Minister of Australia from 1991 to 1996, ascending to the office after two leadership challenges against his predecessor, Bob Hawke. As Prime Minister, he was interested in a \\"big picture\\" approach to government, engaging with issues such as a closer relationship with Asia, Aboriginal reconciliation and the formation of an Australian republic. His government was defeated in the 1996 federal election by the Liberal-National Coalition under John Howard. Writer Casey Bennetto was inspired to write a musical about Keating following his disappointment at the result of the 2004 federal election, which saw the Howard government returned for a fourth term. \\"It was time to have a laugh at it,\\" he said. He says Keating's story appealed to him because of its classic dramatic structure, that of a man who struggles, \\"makes it to the top\\" and must compete against \\"three bad guys\\"—successive Opposition leaders John Hewson, Alexander Downer and John Howard. Bennetto believed Keating's colourful personality made him an \\"ideal\\" character for musical theatre, citing the former Prime Minister's reputation for being sharp-tongued, wearing Zegna suits and collecting antique clocks. Bennetto wrote the show in eight weeks, drawing on Keating biography Recollections of a Bleeding Heart by Don Watson. He describes it as a \\"ridiculously pro-Paul Keating\\" piece which ultimately aims to be funny and entertaining. Production history Originally performed by musical group the Drowsy Drivers, Keating! premiered at the 2005 Melbourne International Comedy Festival as a low-budget, single- act show in a 100-seat venue at the Melbourne Trades Hall. Mike McLeish played the lead role, with Bennetto as \\"the three Hs – Hawke, Hewson and Howard\\", Enio Pozzebon as Gareth Evans and Cam Rogers as Alexander Downer. Despite the musical's success in Melbourne, Bennetto did not have any plans for Keating! after the end of the comedy festival. However, producer Catherine Woodfield (Bennetto's partner and Trades Hall publican) insisted they develop it further. Between 2005 and 2006 they took it on tour across Australia, including a week of shows in the Sydney Opera House, a return season at Melbourne's Trades Hall, a two-week season at the Adelaide Cabaret Festival, a week of shows at the Brisbane Powerhouse and two nights in Darwin. Also in 2006, renowned director Neil Armfield offered to direct a production of Keating! at Sydney's Belvoir St Theatre with Company B. For the Company B production Bennetto reworked the musical into a two-act piece, writing six new songs for the show. Of the original cast, only McLeish, Pozzebon and Bennetto were retained; McLeish returned as Keating and Pozzebon as Evans, while Bennetto took on the roles of Hewson and Downer. Terry Serio joined the cast as Hawke and Howard. Bennetto says that both he and McLeish were worried that Armfield would turn \\"relatively simply staged, roughly hewn\\" musical into \\"the Amadeus version\\" without the original show's sense of fun, but instead felt it became a \\"more accomplished, buffed-up version of the original show\\". The Company B version of Keating! enjoyed sold-out seasons in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth, Canberra, Wollongong, Albany and elsewhere (including a run of shows at the 2007 Melbourne International Comedy Festival) before coming to a close on 31 August 2008.https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/work/742 On 20 August 2008, ABC2 broadcast a live performance of the show from Sydney's Seymour Centre. The recording was released on DVD by Madman Entertainment in November 2008. Response The premiere of the Drowsy Drivers' production at the 2005 Melbourne International Comedy Festival was met with enthusiastic reviews. Comedian Chris Addison praised the musical as \\"the best show I've seen at this festival in five years\\" and The Age's Daniel Ziffer described it as \\"clever and superbly funny\\". Within the first week it had become one of the most popular shows of the festival, having sold out by the fifth show. By the end of its Melbourne run, the show had won three major festival awards—the Barry, The Age Critics' Award and the Golden Gibbo—the first time any production had ever done so. For the songs of Keating!, Bennetto won both the 2006 Helpmann and Green Room Awards for best original musical score. The Company B version also received strong reviews, with a writer in Brisbane's Courier-Mail describing it as \\"brilliantly satirical\\" and a reviewer in Melbourne's Age awarding it the top rating of five stars. However Paul Sheehan, writing for the Sydney Morning Herald, criticised the musical's pro-Keating bias, calling the script \\"preachy and safe\\" and an insult to those who voted for Howard. In 2007 it won the Helpmann Award for Best Musical, as well as the awards for best direction for Armfield and best actor in a supporting role for Serio. The following year it won another Helpmann for best regional touring production. By the end of its 2007 Sydney season, it had taken $500,000 in box office earnings, and by its final show in 2008 its total audience had reached over 223,000 people across Australia. Keating, who has attended the show multiple times, believes that it is popular because politics and public life today are without humour. \\"The game is very dour,\\" he says, \\"But satire can get a lot across. It can cut out the humbug.\\" He believes another reason is an increased interest in the unsettled issues in the national debate, such as the question of a republic. Downer has also seen the show and commented afterwards that he enjoys satire and thought \\"Keating! the musical was far better than Keating the prime minister.\\" Synopsis The following summary refers to the extended, two-act version of the musical. =Act One= The show begins with Bob Hawke introducing the political situation of 1990 and the contrasting personalities of Hawke—with his enthusiasm for \\"footy\\" and cricket—and his deputy, Paul Keating, who is fond of \\"the works of Mahler\\" (\\"My Right Hand Man\\"). While Hawke admires Keating's economic prowess, he is perplexed by the other man's \\"un-Australian\\" interests. Keating emerges and shares some of his life story and his hopes to gain the leadership from Hawke as they had agreed to in a deal known as the Kirribilli Accord for the venue at which it was reached (\\"Do It In Style\\"). However, Hawke reneges on the deal and Keating returns to the back bench. In a rock ballad, vaguely in the style of Queen, he sings of his desolation before resolving to challenge for the Prime Ministership (\\"I Remember Kirribilli\\"). He confronts Hawke with the blue-eyed soul-style \\"It's Time\\"; the song refers to the name of former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam's famous 1970s campaign and uses Keating's fondness for collecting antique clocks as a motif for his belief that it is indeed time for a change of leadership. Keating becomes Prime Minister and sings of his ambitions for the nation—including a treaty with Australian Aborigines, an Australian republic and improved relationships with Australia's Asian neighbours—in a reggae song (\\"Ruler Of The Land\\"). As Keating celebrates his success, Gareth Evans cautions that the political life of a Prime Minister is limited in the minor-key Latin tune \\"The Beginning Is The End\\". Both he and the ghost of Gough Whitlam counsel Keating to \\"maintain your rage\\". Keating then faces off against Opposition Leader John Hewson in a freestyle rap battle, arguing over the merits of Hewson's \\"Fightback!\\" policy platform, with Keating winning the battle due to his superior command of colourful invective, much of which is drawn from actual Keating quotes (\\"On The Floor\\"). Angered, Hewson challenges Keating to call an early election, but Keating refuses in the song \\"I Wanna Do You Slowly\\". The song's title again refers to a well- known Keating quote, but takes on a sexual interpretation in the slow, Barry White-style funk number. The Keating government contests the 1993 federal election, and in an animated video Kerry O'Brien, Michael Kroger, Robert Ray and Antony Green report on the incoming results in scat over ukulele (\\"Antony Green\\"). Labor wins, and Keating sings about the unexpected victory as \\"the sweetest victory of all\\", using a famous phrase from his actual election night speech (\\"Sweet\\"). =Act Two= In the ska tune \\"The Arse End Of The Earth\\", which refers to Keating's private description of Australia, both Keating and Evans complain about the day-to-day issues of the economy and their unfavourable portrayal in the commercial media getting in the way of their larger agenda, including republicanism, a new flag, and Aboriginal reconciliation. Alexander Downer replaces Hewson as Opposition Leader for a short and unsuccessful period. In a costume of fishnets, corsetry and lipstick that alludes to a photograph of the actual Downer posing in fishnet stockings for a competition, he sings his belief that he is just \\"too freaky\\" for the leadership (\\"Freaky\\"). Meanwhile, Evans has an extramarital affair with Australian Democrats leader Cheryl Kernot (typically played by a male) (\\"Heavens, Mister Evans\\"). In an understated minor-key bossa nova song, Keating sings of the need to recognise and apologise for the damage done by white colonisation and subsequent subjugation of the Australian Aboriginal population (\\"Redfern\\"), before segueing into a more upbeat mambo about the Mabo decision by the High Court of Australia and his attempts to use the decision to promote a reconciliation agenda (\\"Ma(m)bo\\"). John Howard becomes leader of the Opposition, presenting a new threat to Keating. Howard describes his intense desire for power and his thirst for revenge against the petty humiliations put on him as a child in a menacing minor-key march (\\"Power\\"). However, in the media he presents himself as \\"a normal bloke and nothing more\\" (\\"The Mateship\\"). Through various costume changes, he attempts to cast himself as a sports fan, a friend of the Australian soldier and a farmer, though the song implies that these are only costumes. The song also refers to the \\"children overboard\\" affair, his criticism of political correctness, and his use of immigration as a political issue, some of which occurred after the actual Howard's subsequent election to Prime Minister. In a slow rock duet, Keating and Howard both beseech voters to \\"Choose Me\\". However, as the 1996 electoral polls close, Keating concludes that he is doomed electorally. He sings of his unachieved dreams and with some bitterness at what he sees as the backward-looking message of his opponent in a country-influenced ballad referring to former Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley's description of Labor's overarching goals (\\"The Light On The Hill\\"). In the final number, \\"Historical Revisionism\\", the election tightens dramatically and the results come to hang on a single polling booth—the theatre in which the musical is playing. Keating wins and Howard concedes with the line \\"Well, I'm sorry... that I lost!\\" (a reference to his unwillingness to support a formal apology to the Aboriginal people). As the song's title indicates, the actual Keating did not win the 1996 election. The song segues into a reprise of \\"Ruler Of The Land\\". Music The songs of Keating! employ a wide range of musical styles, including bossa nova, blues, rap, reggae, soul, swing and beer-barrel waltz. Mara Lazzarotto Davis has written a highly readable and entertaining academic study of Casey Bennetto's \\"Keating!\\" as a generic hybrid - deftly blending vaudeville, theatre and musical comedy (\\"\\"Flicking the Switch: Vaudeville Traditions and Myth-Making in Keating!\\" in Sydney Undergraduate Journal of Musicology, Vol. 5, December 2015). The lyrics frequently draw on quotes from the real Keating and other political figures, particularly in \\"On The Floor\\" which contains numerous verbatim quotes from Keating's debates with Hewson. In expanding the show for the Company B production Bennetto wrote six new songs, adding an Act One \\"curtain\\" number (\\"Sweet\\"), an exploration of Keating's time in office (\\"The Arse End Of The Earth\\"), two songs on Aboriginal reconciliation and native title (\\"Redfern\\" and \\"Ma(m)bo\\") and another song for Howard (\\"The Mateship\\"). \\"Dogs Of Damnation\\", a song from the original version in which Evans warns Keating that his political life is limited, was replaced by the similarly themed \\"The Beginning Is The End\\". A live recording of the original single-act version played at the Sydney Opera House was released in 2006 by Bella Union Enterprises and is available through the Drowsy Drivers' Keating! website. In 2007 Company B released a cast recording of the extended show containing all of the musical numbers featured on stage except for \\"Antony Green\\". The CD features the Company B production's original cast, with McLeish as Keating, Serio as Hawke and Howard, Bennetto as Hewson and Downer, Pozzebon as Evans and Mick Stuart as Kernot. The band consists of Alon Ilsar (drums), Eden Ottignon (bass), Pozzebon (keyboards), Guy Strazz (acoustic guitar) and Mick Stuart (electric guitar). By 2008, the CD had sold over 5,000 copies. Also that year, a live recording of the extended version was performed at Sydney's Seymour Centre.http://jamesobrien.id.au/2007/03/21/keating-the- musical Among the audience members who attended the recording, the real-life Keating and Cheryl Kernot made an appearance.

He dies with his wife and two daughters at his bedside. In New York, Phil forgoes leadership of the Lupertazzis in favor of his protégé, Gerry Torciano. However, at dinner in a restaurant with Silvio, Gerry is killed on the orders of Faustino \\"Doc\\" Santoro. Tony, furious that Silvio was put in danger, urges Little Carmine to vie again for control of the Lupertazzis. Little Carmine declines; his wife has said, \\"I don't want to be the wealthiest widow on Long Island.\\" Meadow has broken up with Finn. Blanca is getting fed up with A.J.. Tony is approached by FBI agents Harris and Goddard, who ask him to pass on anything he notices at the Newark docks that might concern terrorism. Tony turns his back on them. Christopher finishes Little Carmine's Mafia-themed slasher film Cleaver. Following the film's premiere in New York City, Tony congratulates Chris and mingles with the Lupertazzis and the cast at the after-party. Tony does not see it at first, but Carmela notes a similarity between the film's love triangle and Chris, Tony and Adriana, seeing the violent murder of the antagonist as Chris's \\"revenge fantasy\\" against Tony. Carmela confronts Chris; he denies any similarities but is worried about what Tony might think. Chris asks his screenwriter, J.T. Dolan, to tell Tony that the character was his idea. When J.T. refuses, Chris hits him over the head with a Humanitas Prize trophy. J.T. then visits the Bada Bing and tells Tony that he stole the characters and plot from the film Born Yesterday. Tony seems to doubt J.T.'s account, but watches the film at home. Later, he painfully admits to Dr. Melfi that he believes Chris despises him, and that Cleaver illustrates his hatred. He recalls being a father figure to Chris. Melfi asks Tony to cautiously evaluate if he is not \\"reading into things,\\" but he replies that his sessions with her have taught him enough about the human subconscious. At the baptism of Chris's daughter, godfather and father, Tony and Chris, embrace closely, but their eyes belie the closeness.

The band folded in the early 1980s, but re-launched in 2018. Formation and genre They started out as a trio, but almost immediately expanded by adding a bassist to their line-up. The original members were: * Cynthia 'Cindy' Kent (vocals and tambourine), born 7 August 1945, Oldbury, Worcestershire; * Mike Jones (vocals and guitar), born Michael Edwin Jones, 16 September 1943, Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, died 11 May 2008, Exeter, Devon; * John Fyffe (banjo), born 3 July 1943, Uddingston, South Lanarkshire, Scotland; * Mansel Davies (double bass), born 22 March 1942, South Wales. The Settlers were initially known as the Birmingham Folk Four, but became known as the Settlers after the relative success of their first single, \\"Settle Down\\".The Times obituary of Mike Jones, 21 July 2008 A six-month residency on the BBC television series, Singalong, led to support bookings on tours with, among others, Dusty Springfield, Roy Orbison and The Small Faces.The Times, 21 July 2008 The Settlers have generally been referred to as a folk group. However, like the Seekers, the successful Australian group with which they shared marked similarities, some of their material gravitated towards mainstream pop, which, taking its cue from American singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Joan Baez and such groups as Peter, Paul and Mary, We Five, and The Byrds, readily absorbed folk influences in various ways in the mid-1960s. The Settlers’ melodic style was largely settled before the advent of British folk-rock in the guise of Fairport Convention and Pentangle later in the sixties. In 1969, the band appeared with Cliff Richard, Una Stubbs, and William Hartnell amongst others in a six-part religious themed drama serial on ITV. The series, produced by Tyne Tees TV was not networked and thus reached a limited audience. Only three of the six episodes have survived. Early musical output The Settlers' first single \\"Sassafras\\"/\\"Settle Down\\", was released in 1964. They became quite well known nationally, assisted by frequent appearances on television and, until 1967, regular exposure on offshore pirate radio stations. In particular, their recording of John Lennon and Paul McCartney’s \\"Nowhere Man\\" (1965) was, together with The Overlanders’ 1966 UK No.1 hit, \\"Michelle\\", and The Truth's version of \\"Girl\\", among the best known covers of songs from the Beatles' album, Rubber Soul (1965). However, although \\"Nowhere Man\\" reached a high of No.5 in Radio London's non-sales based Fab 40 in March 1966 and the group's spirited version of Gordon Lightfoot's \\"Early Morning Rain\\" received a good deal of airplay in May 1966, the Settlers did not succeed in enjoying a Top 40 hit during the 1960s. Their most successful record, \\"The Lightning Tree\\" (helped along due to its use as the theme tune of the British TV series Follyfoot), reached No.36 in the UK Singles Chart in 1971.Guinness British Hit Singles (15th ed, 2002) Like the Seekers, the group also included a double bassist. The original bassist, Mansel Davies, left in 1965 to pursue a career in teaching, and was replaced by Geoff Srdzinski (born Geoffrey Srodzinski, 10 June 1946, Plymouth, Devon), who shared accommodation in Hampstead, London, with Tony Hooper of Strawbs. Hooper's song, \\"Always on My Mind\\", was released as a single by the Settlers early in 1967.. Cindy Kent As has often been the case with sole female members of bands, Cindy Kent (like Judith Durham of the Seekers) attracted her own share of attention, as the most recognisable face of the Settlers. Originally known for her fine singing voice, photogenic good looks, and tendency to wear mini-skirts, later her public espousal of Christianity became the media focus, particularly when it brought her into contact with the singer Cliff Richard, a prominent born again Christian, and they jointly contributed to various events with a Christian theme. Shortly after recording a religious album I Am Your Servant in 1973, Cindy Kent left the band, and later released a solo single \\"I Only Want To Be In The World\\" on the Beeb label in 1975, before moving into radio broadcasting. Kent worked at Radio 4, Radio 2, and Radio 1 (in that order), and later became a broadcaster on London's first legal commercial radio stations, LBC and Capital Radio, as well as Sheffield's Radio Hallam,Her employment history in radio is catalogued on this page. and in 1995 was the first presenter recruited to the team for Premier Christian Radio,Her Premier profile may be viewed here. where she stayed until 2010. She describes herself as a high church or catholic Anglican Christian. In 2005 she was admitted as a Reader in the Church of England; on 30 June 2007 she was ordained as a deacon; the following year (2008) she was ordained as a priest. She was Priest-in-Charge of the parish of St John, Whetstone in the Diocese of London from 2010 until her retirement in 2016. In 2016, she received an MBE for services to religious broadcasting, and moved to the Isle of Sheppey. Later musical output After the departure of Cindy Kent, the line up transitioned from acoustic four-part pop folk harmony, to a more contemporary five-piece electric sound with Mike Jones (guitar/banjo/vocals), Andie Sheridan (Kent's replacement as female vocals), Paul Greedus (guitar/vocals), Chris Johnstone (bass/vocals), and George Jeffrey on drums. In 1974 this line up recorded an album for York Records, entitled The New Sound of the Settlers. In early 1976, Valery Ann (also known as Valeryan and as Valerie Anne Lawrence), who had released an original song \\"My Love Loves Me\\" on Decca in 1965 while she was still at school in Surrey, replaced Andie Sheridan as female vocalist, and the line up changed back to a four piece acoustic close harmony group, with Mike Jones, Paul Greedus, Valery Ann, and Steve Somers-Smith. It was this line up that went into the studios to record \\"Whichaway Billy\\" for Riverdale. The single was released in October 1976, by which time Valery Ann (after only 9 months in the band) had already left to pursue a solo career. She was replaced by Patty Vetta, giving a final line-up of: * Mike Jones (guitar/banjo/fiddle/vocals); * Paul Greedus (bass/vocals/occasional piano*); * Steve Somers-Smith (vocals/guitar); * Patty Vetta (vocals/tambourine). Mike Jones was the last surviving original member, when the band broke up in 1981. Steve Somers-Smith had joined the band in 1975 after winning ATV's New Faces as a singer-songwriter with his own song \\"Mavis Brown\\". He has stayed with the group ever since, and is still a member. From 1975 until the group disbanded in 1981, Somers-Smith was often credited simply as \\"Steve Smith\\". Since the relaunch of the band in 2018 he has been commonly credited as \\"Steve Somers\\". Patty Vetta, well known on the British folk club circuit, replaced Varley Ann as the female lead voice. Patty Vetta, like Steve Smith, stayed with the group until its end in the early 1980s, and remains a member in the relaunched group since 2018. Albums The Settlers' albums included their debut Sing Out for Decca Records in the UK, and London Records in the US (1964), which featured an eclectically varied selection of folk songs, including \\"The Keeper\\", \\"Over the Stone\\", \\"The Three Jolly Rogues of Lynn\\" and \\"The Golden Vanity\\", Ewan MacColl's \\"Dirty Old Town\\" and \\"Shoals of Herring\\", Matt McGinn's \\"Coorie Doon\\", and \\"Frog Went A-Courtin'\\" Whereas Go!, (Pye Records, 1966) paired the group with The Overlanders both separately and together. The eponymous The Settlers, for (Island Records, 1967) included Bob Dylan's \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and \\"Mr Tambourine Man\\" and such folk standards as \\"The Wreck of the Old 97\\". Call Again for (Marble Arch Records, 1969) collected the group's singles output for Pye Records, and was released after they had left that record label. Settlers Alive for (Columbia Records, 1970) was recorded live at Queen Elizabeth Hall the previous year, whilst Sing a New Song (Myrrh, 1972), had a strongly religious component. Lightning Tree (York, 1972), which, in addition to the title hit, included extracts, spoken by Cindy Kent, from Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1963 speech \\"I Have a Dream\\". Lightning Tree was re-released by Decca in 1974 as The World of the Settlers . Re- launch in 2018 Following its formal break-up, the band members continued to provide backing music services to the BBC for a number of years. In 2018 The Settlers re-launched, following more than 35 dormant years. Both Steve Somers- Smith and Patty Vetta remain in the line-up, having been members of the band since 1975 and 1976 respectively. In the current line-up they are joined by Tony Harris and musician/manager Dave Smith, who also manages the re-launched band through his management company, Main Stage Acts. In 2019 the band released \\"Resettled\\", its first album release for 37 years.

Their business immediately booms, arousing suspicion among local campus authorities and Toby's girlfriend, Hunter. They subsequently are able to purchase many expensive items such as big-screen televisions and new computers to help them manage their complex business. When their business takes off, Jude receives threats from two local Italian bookies to back down because of their territories for the business overlap. When a plan by Jude fails to materialize when betting on the college's team to win the game, Toby devises a way to eliminate the threat from the other bookies and get them out of the business. Jude makes a bet with the two Italian bookies, letting them choose whatever game and winner they want, which ends up being a boxing match. Knowing the game would be fixed, Jude and the others liquidate all of their assets and bet all of their earnings on the boxing match. The underdog on which they placed the bet won.

An expansion to the United States started in 2016 with a Dallas, Texas location. History Former Moxie's logo as Moxie's Classic Grill A Moxie's Classic Grill restaurant at the Scarborough Town Centre. Moxie's began as a small deli and diner in Calgary, Alberta, Canada in 1986, before transforming itself into an upscale premium casual dining restaurant and lounge in 2004. Following recent economic and development booms, Moxie's has begun opening new locations rapidly across Canada with a focus on globally inspired comfort food. Their niche is providing clients with an upscale experience compared to their competition, by providing a sophisticated dining experience. The menu focuses on house-made ingredients with a global inspiration. Their direct competition would be other premium casual chains such as Earls (restaurant chain) and Cactus Club Cafe. Northland Properties owns Moxie's Grill and Bar, as well as Chop Steakhouse & Bar, Shark Club Bar & Grill, Rockford Wok, Bar One Urban Lounge and Denny's Restaurants franchises in Canada. Moxie's restaurants feature dining rooms and lounges that are open seven days a week. Moxie's has daily drink specials, and patios across the country open throughout the summer. In December 2006 Moxie's expanded its brand to include CHOP Steakhouse & Bar and opened the first location in Edmonton, Alberta. CHOP has since expanded and has locations in Edmonton, Kelowna, Richmond, Winnipeg, and Calgary, and their first Eastern Canada location was opened in Toronto, Ontario in 2012. Criticism In April 2014, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation did a piece on Moxie's having more health violations than any other large restaurant chain in Canada. They also sent a reporter undercover with hidden cameras as a server at a Moxie's location in Vancouver. A CBC Marketplace investigation in February 2018 found that in response to Ontario's minimum wage increase, Moxie's required servers in that province \\"tip out\\" 5.75% of their sales (that is, contribute this share of their tips to a pool for cooks, busboys, and other workers who do not receive tips); it had been 4.75% prior to the change in the minimum wage.

Most of his repertoire consisted of sones and guaracha-sones, many with double entendres in the lyrics. His composition \\"Candela\\" gained international fame due to its inclusion in the Buena Vista Social Club album.Giro, Radamés 2007. Diccionario enciclopédico de la música en Cuba. La Habana, vol 3 p180. Career When he was 15 years old he began playing the maracas as part of a septet of sones known as La Tropical made up by some friends with the purpose of enjoying and performing at the country dances. During the 1940s, he began his career as composer with \\"Tumbaíto\\", a song that was included in Libertad Lamarque's repertoire and title he used as an alias for some time. Afterwards, he composed two sones, \\"Como vengo este año\\" and \\"El Guayabero\\". He composed the latter when he was performing as tres player in the Trovadores Holguineros ensemble. Pacho Alonso, the well-known Cuban musician, first heard the song and then recorded it in a long-playing record that toured across the world. Later on, the Orquesta Original de Manzanillo used the refrain in a tribute to Faustino who, since then, was known as \\"El Guayabero\\". Skillful master of the double meaning, the Cuban's idiosyncrasy, his ingenuity, witty remarks and his love for highly erotic themes amusingly disguised are some of his main features. Unlike most trovadors, Oramas played sones rather than boleros, though this was also true, to some extent, of the famous Trio Matamoros. His preferred instrument was the tres, which is a typical instrument of the son; most other trovadors such as María Teresa Vera or Carlos Puebla played the Spanish guitar. However, his backing groups usually included a Spanish guitar in the basic rhythm. He composed the song \\"Candela\\" of the Buena Vista Social Club (1997) recording, which was a worldwide hit. Wim Wenders directed a documentary film of the musicians involved, Buena Vista Social Club (1999) which was nominated for an Academy Award in 2000.  Compositions  Oramas composed over fifty numbers. He mostly sang his own compositions, which he could perform at any length by adding or subtracting verses. His signature number was \\"El Guayabero\\"; other popular numbers included \\"A María Elena\\", \\"Como baila Marieta\\", \\"Compositor confundido\\", \\"Contigo mi china\\", \\"El tumbaíto\\", \\"La triguenita\\", \\"Las mujeres de Bayamo\\", \\"Los abuelos se rebelan\\", \\"Mi son retosón\\". In most of these compositions the rhythm and the poetical structure is rather similar. Four-line verses are interspersed with two or four repeating lines, and the whole or part may be repeated, perhaps several times. The real content comes in the language, which is amusing, human, topical, sometimes vulgar, always entertaining. Rather surprisingly, his work has not been analysed by Cuban writers until recently, although he was well known in the eastern provinces. Indeed, it is difficult to find his name in the various histories of the trovador movement.He is not mentioned in, for example, Canizares, Dulcila 1995. La trova tradicional. 2nd ed, La Habana.

Born Azlina Jailani on 28 July 1964The Malaysian Bar - Lina Joy v Majlis Agama Islam Wilayah Persekutuan & 2 Ors 2005 [CA] in Malaysia to Muslim parents of Javanese descent,Learning from conservatism in Malaysia she converted at age 26. The Lina Joy case sparkled a debate about apostasy in Malaysia,Lina Joy affair sparks apostasy debate among Muslims, AsiaNews, 20 augustus 2006 and her failed legal attempt to not have her religion assigned as \\"Islam\\" on her identity card is considered a landmark case in Malaysia.Path to leave islam simple but far from easy, The Malay Mail Online, 12 July 2014 Court case In 1998, Joy was baptised, and applied to have her conversion legally recognised by the Malaysian courts. Though her change of name was recognised in 1999 and so noted on her identity card, her change of religion was not (for lack of a Mahkamah SyariahNote: Sharia, the Arabic term for Islamic law, is spelled \\"Syariah\\" in Malaysian English in accordance with the Malay romanisation system confirmation document); for this reason, she filed suit with the High Court in 1999, bypassing the Syariah Court (Islamic court). She later filed suit with the Federal Court in 2006. Joy hopes to live openly as a Christian; she was forced to go into hiding by the publicity surrounding her case. In a majority verdict delivered on 30 May 2007, the Federal Court rejected her appeal. Her appeal was dismissed 2-1 by Chief Justice Tun Ahmad Fairuz Sheikh Abdul Halim and Datuk Alauddin Mohd Sheriff. The ruling stated that \\"a person who wanted to renounce his/her religion must do so according to existing laws or practices of the particular religion. Only after the person has complied with the requirements and the authorities are satisfied that the person has apostatised, can she embrace Christianity.... In other words, a person cannot, at one's whims and fancies renounce or embrace a religion.\\" The dissenting Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Datuk Richard Malanjum wrote that \\"Hence, in my view this is tantamount to unequal treatment under the law. In other words it is discriminatory and unconstitutional and should therefore be struck down. For this reason alone, the relief sought for by the appellant should be granted, namely for a declaration that she is entitled to have an identity card in which the word 'Islam' does not appear.\\" Legal recognition would have allowed her to have the change of religion noted on her national identity card; it would also remove the legal barrier to her marrying her Christian fiancé (marriage between Muslim women and non-Muslim men is forbidden under Malaysian law and under the Shariah/Islamic Jurisprudence; the non-Muslim man is required to convert to Islam under Malaysian law; Under Shariah, Muslim men are only allowed to marry Muslims or People of the Book, those who adhere to Abrahamic religions that pre-date Islam, however with conditions and restrictions). In Malaysia, the Shariah Court alone has the power to deal with Islamic issues, including legal recognition for conversion to and from Islam. Conversely, the Shariah Court has no jurisdiction over those who are not Muslims. Joy, by her own admission, is no longer Muslim, but only the Shariah Court can legally recognise this. Conversion is not something unknown, and according to Muslim Lawyers Association spokesman Pawanchek Merican, \\"…In Negeri Sembilan, the Shariah court allowed 16 people to renounce Islam…\\"The Sun, Thursday 31 May 2007, p. 2. According to a senior official in the National Registration Department (NRD), for the NRD to change the religion on her identity card would mean that the department would be officially declaring her an apostate, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Shariah Court. The jurisdiction of the Shariah Court over converts from Islam to other religions has been hotly debated by the Malaysian public in the past few years, with this and other court cases involving converts closely followed by the media. Joy is not the first person to apply for recognition of conversion from Islam; another woman named only as \\"Maria\\" by the BBC is also pursuing a similar case. In 2006, the Negeri Sembilan Syariah High Court in Seremban granted recognition for the conversion from Islam to Buddhism of Wong Ah Kiu (also known as Nyonya Tahir). However, being raised by a Chinese Buddhist family despite her Malay origins, Wong had never practised Islam in her life and was deceased at the time of the ruling.

The ahwash is performed on the occasion of local festivals as a celebration of the community.  Description  The ahwash is usually performed by two large groups of people, typically men and women on opposite sides, who alternate their performances of song, dance, poetry, and drumming on frame drums. The ahwash is rarely performed outside of individual villages, because of the difficulty of transporting the large number of participants (often more than twenty, and sometimes 150 or more). As a result, the ahwash has developed somewhat independently among different villages, and the details of the performances differ. History Ahwash may have come from Telouet, though historians have struggled to conclusively determine its origins, because of the lack of written history. Some believe the dance migrated along with the tribes and villages in the area. The dance is now found throughout the High Atlas and Sous regions.  Religion and spirituality  The ahwash is recognized by many Moroccans to involve some pre-Islamic components of traditional Berber religion. While the poetry may make reference to Islamic traditions, the communal form of dancing and singing, involving members of the community of both sexes, stands in contrast to conservative Islamic views. In most places, an ahwash is performed in front of a saint's tomb during religious holidays, called moussem. In some instances, it is disallowed for fear of offending the saint, or for fear of the combination of the saint's power and the power of the ahwash. Very religious Moroccans may choose not to take part in the ahwash, because they believe the devil is a part of the performance. The celebration of an ahwash is both an important communal and spiritual practice, sometimes leading to a supernatural experience; there are many stories from southern Moroccan villages of performers who are clairvoyant.

Their head office is in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. History =Founding= Leroy Earl \\"Bus\\" Fuller (1928–2019), the founder of Earls, was a Korean War veteran and an experienced restaurateur with over twenty successful and failed restaurants to his name. His first restaurant was opened in Sunburst, Montana, United States, in 1954 under the name \\"Green & White\\". In the late 1950s, Fuller moved his young family to Canada and operated a series of A&W; (Canada) locations in Edmonton, Alberta. Soon, the Fullers were operating thirty locations. In the 1970s, the Fullers moved west to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was during this time that Fuller went into business with his son Stan Fuller, founding the first Earls restaurant in 1982 in Edmonton. The chain quickly grew when the Fullers set up an Earls restaurant in their new home town of Vancouver in 1983. Although its menu originally consisted mostly of burgers and beer, Earls has changed the menu to offer \\"dishes inspired by trips around the world.\\" Over the years, Earls restaurants have spread across Western Canada, the United States, and Ontario. =Recent= While the chain was originally a family business, in 2013, Mo Jessa became the first non-Fuller to be named as company president. The Fullers are involved in a number of other Western Canadian restaurant chains. Jeff Fuller and Stewart Fuller, two other sons of Leroy, are involved in JOEY (a western Canadian restaurant chain) and Cactus Club Cafe, respectively. Ole Stan Fuller owns a 20% share of the latter establishment. After the other brothers dropped out. In December 2017, Earls announced that they would be closing one of their first locations, on Marine Drive in North Vancouver. In early 2018, the chain opened a concept restaurant in West Vancouver as a replacement. Sustainability The Earls chain has utilized chicken raised cage-free, and sustainable seafood vetted by Ocean Wise and the Marine Stewardship Council. In April 2016, following a trial at its flagship locations, Earls announced that all of its locations would only serve beef sourced from farms accredited under Humane Farm Animal Care's \\"Certified Humane\\" standards. While Canadian suppliers were used for the trial, Earls stated that there were not enough suitable farms to meet the required demand across their entire chain. As such, the chain chose to source its meat from an accredited farm in Kansas, United States. Following the announcement, Earls faced criticism from government officials for its decision to stop using domestic beef; Rob McNabb, head of the Canadian Cattlemen's Association, criticized the implication that Canadian cattle producers were not working towards humane cattle raising practices, and stated that they were \\"second to none in ensuring the welfare of their animals\\". The Earls company stated that it would use a Canadian supplier if it met these standards while meeting its supply demands, but on May 5, 2016, the chain decided to reverse its decision entirely. Company president Mohammad Jessa explained that the decision was a \\"mistake\\", and stated that the company planned to work with ranchers in Alberta to encourage humane practices.

The main attraction in Toongabbie is the Ned Stringer Memorial located on Hower Street. Toongabbie Primary School opened in 1856 and the school is still open to date. The hotel in Toongabbie known as the club hotel closed down in 1913. Toongabbie Post Office opened on 1 December 1865. Toongabbie had an Aussie Rules club which quit in 1999.  History  Toongabbie was an important town that acted as a supply depot en route to the Walhalla Goldfields. Initially, goods were transported between Toongabbie and Walhalla by horse and as Walhalla boomed, Toongabbie’s carrying industry boomed as well. With the advent of railways in the 1870s and 1880s transportation of goods into Toongabbie was mostly via train and then local carriers to Walhalla. Walhalla then decided that a railway direct to Walhalla was needed and it was decided that Moe would be the starting point. This was bad news for Toongabbie which over the coming years saw many local carriers selling their horses and the town returned to farming. Toongabbie did try to find alternative income sources in oil, marble and gold but these were not successful long term.  Ned Stringer  There is a memorial for Ned Stringer on the corner of Hower and O’Meara St Toongabbie. Ned Stringer discovered gold in 1862 in a creek which was later named Stringers Creek. This was an important gold discovery that started the gold rush at Walhalla.  Toongabbie today  Toongabbie is approximately 2 hours east of Melbourne, nestled in the foothills of the Great Divide.

Early years A strong member of the Mormon faith, Watene was born in Thames in 1910. He attended Thames High School, Opotiki District High School and then the Māori Agriculture College in the Hawkes Bay before he moved to Auckland where he worked as a labourer and a clerk. Rugby league In Auckland Watene joined the City rugby league club in the Auckland Rugby League competition in 1929 and represented and captained Auckland. He debuted for Auckland in a 22-19 win over Northland at Carlaw Park. In the 1933 Auckland Rugby League season Watene top scored in the senor grade competitions with 77 points from 1 try, 26 conversions and 11 penalties. In 1936 Watene joined the newly re-formed Manukau side. He was the club's captain and played a major role in attracting many other Māori players to the club. As a result, Manukau quickly became a force in the Auckland competition, winning both the Fox Memorial and Roope Rooster in their debut year. He also played lock for the New Zealand Māori rugby league team, who secured a famous 16-5 victory over Australia in 1937 at Carlaw Park in front of 11,000 spectators. Watene was first selected for the New Zealand national rugby league team while only 19 in 1930 and played for them until 1937. He also captained the New Zealand national rugby league team in 1936 and 1937, becoming the first Māori to do so.

He is buried in the crypt of St. Paul's Church (Halifax). Early life and military service Parr was born in Dublin, Ireland as part of the Anglo-Irish aristocracy that had settled on the island during the 17th century and attended Trinity High School. At the age of 19 he joined the British Army's 20th Regiment of Foot as an ensign, and saw service in the War of the Austrian Succession. A subaltern officer, he was with the Prince William, Duke of Cumberland and his army as it marched through Scotland against Charles Stuart's Jacobite rising at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. In 1755 he became adjutant to James Wolfe, the colonel of the 20th Regiment of Foot. In 1759, during the Seven Years' War he was wounded at the Battle of Minden and spent six months in hospital. He was then stationed at Gibraltar for six years and purchased the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1776, he resigned his regiment and, in 1778 he received a sinecure as major of the Tower of London. Governor of Nova Scotia hatchment, St. Paul's Church (Halifax), Nova Scotia He was offered the position of Governor of Nova Scotia and took up his position as the American Revolutionary War was coming to an end and United Empire Loyalists were fleeing north to escape persecution. Parr arrived in Halifax with his family on 5 October 1782. His predecessor, Francis Legge had been an absentee governor for six years since being recalled to England and the colony had been under the stewardship of a succession of military lieutenant-governors. The last of these was Sir Andrew Hamond, who had expected to be named governor himself. Angry at Parr's appointment, he resigned shortly after the new governor arrived and returned to England. Edmund Fanning, a recently arrived Loyalist, was named Parr's new lieutenant- governor. Parr immediately took over as colonel of the Royal Nova Scotia Volunteer Regiment. In 1786, when the colonial administration of British North America was reorganized, Parr had hoped to be named to the new position of Governor-General of The Canadas and Governor-in-Chief of British North America but was disappointed when the position went to Guy Carleton, who was elevated to the peerage as Lord Dorchester. The position of Governor of Nova Scotia was thereby abolished and Parr was reappointed as lieutenant governor of the province with his superior being Lord Dorchester. Parr's administration oversaw the settlement of Black Nova Scotians who were African-American Loyalists fleeing the United States. Parr was accused of \\"discriminatory practices and long delays\\" in the matter. He attempted to establish a whaling industry in Dartmouth (see Quaker Whaler House), and was embroiled in the \\"judges' affair\\" in which lawyers accused him of appointing incompetent or biased jurists to the bench. Parr was under pressure to provide land and supplies for the new Loyalist settlers while not bankrupting the treasury. The British government was inundated with complaints about the difficulties the Loyalists were facing and Parr's allegedly unsympathetic attitude towards them. The stress of the position may have taken a toll on his health, he died in office at the age of 66. He funeral was with full military honours, presided over by the 20th Foot. Parr was interred in Halifax's St. Paul's Church.  Legacy  The town of Parrsboro, Nova Scotia, is named in his honour.

The fast bowler After playing for local clubs, he joined the Leicestershire County Cricket Club ground staff as a fast bowler in 1905 but, because he wore spectacles, was not re-engaged at the end of the season. He then joined Kidderminster in the Birmingham League and achieved such success that in 1912 the county re- signed him and he continued with them until he retired in 1929. He made his debut in county cricket in 1912, and played fairly regularly in the two seasons before the first world war. It was in the middle and late 1920s, however, when he was around his 40th year and far past the retirement age of most bowlers of his pace, that he showed remarkable skill as a genuinely fast bowler. In a sometimes bleak era for English fast bowling, he was at times the fastest bowler in the country. His best season was 1927 – his benefit year – when he took 102 wickets, at an average of 20.81. His most outstanding performance was to dismiss eight Nottinghamshire batsmen for 44 runs on a flat batting track at Grace Road in 1924. He played 177 matches in all, taking 593 wickets at just 24.67. He claimed five wickets in an innings 35 times and ten wickets in a match on ten occasions. He was no batsman, scoring 1117 runs at 6.76 with a top score of 33. He took 48 catches. Ironically for a man who was to become one of the great umpires his dubious powers of sight during his career were always an issue. Asked in his playing days if he found spectacles a handicap, Alec said: 'The specs are for the look of the thing. I can't see without'em and on hot days I can't see with'em, because they get steamed up. So I bowl on hearing only and appeal twice an over.' The umpire One of the great characters of the sport in his day, famous stories about him abound. Like most renowned umpires he was reluctant to give decisions unless absolutely convinced of the appeal. Once in response to an appeal for run out, he stated: 'That was a \\"photo-finish\\" and as there isn't time to develop the plate, I shall say not out.' In one celebrated brush with combative Australian and Somerset County Cricket Club stalwart Bill Alley, the following exchange ensued after Skelding had turned down a close appeal for LBW. Alley: \\"Sorry Alex, I suppose it would not have hit off stump\\". Skelding: \\"You’re right, Bill.\\" Alley: \\"And, I suppose it would not have hit leg-stump either.\\" Skelding: \\"You’re right again, Bill.\\" Alley \\"But it'd have definitely hit bloody middle!\\" Despite this, he famously officiated over the first all LBW hat trick in cricket, taken by Horace Fisher, the Yorkshire slow left-armer against Somerset County Cricket Club at Bramall Lane in 1932. After giving Mitchell-Innes and Andrews out lbw, he stared up the wicket at batsman Luckes when the third appeal was made, and finally-almost in disbelief-announced, \\"As God's my witness, that's out, too.\\" and lifted his finger. \\"I was never more sure that I was right in each case,\\" he said afterwards, and each of the batsmen agreed that he had been trapped dead in front. His ready wit on the field saw him held in great affection, but his reputation was always underpinned by respect, as he was one of the most accomplished umpires of his day. In one match a batsman who had been celebrating a special event the previous evening was rapped on the pad by a ball. At once the bowler asked: \\"How is he?\\" Said Alec, shaking his head sadly: \\"He's not at all well, and he was even worse last night.\\" Occasionally the joke went against Alec. In a game in 1948 he turned down a strong appeal by the Australian touring team. A little later a dog ran onto the field, and Sid Barnes captured it, carried it to Skelding and said: 'Here you are. All you want now is a white stick!' Alec Skelding stood in 536 first-class games. His first game as umpire began on 9 May 1931 at New Road when he oversaw, Worcestershire County Cricket Club v Northamptonshire County Cricket Club. His final game in the white coat came when Leicestershire, appropriately enough, entertained Ireland at Grace Road. Of his contemporaries, only Frank Chester stood in more first-class games with 774, though David Constant has since eclipsed Skelding in second place. On 14 August 1959, for the very last time, he removed the bails with a theatrical flourish and announced, as he always did, 'And that concludes the entertainment for the day, gentlemen.'

Religious Warfare in Europe 1400–1536, Oxford University Press, 2002 Pope Eugene IV issued a papal bull, Creator omnium, on 17 December 1434, annulling previous permission granted to Portugal to conquer those islands still pagan. Eugene excommunicated anyone who enslaved newly converted Christians, the penalty to stand until the captives were restored to their liberty and possessions.Raiswell, Richard. \\"Eugene IV, Papal bulls of\\", The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery, Junius P. Rodriguez ed., ABC-CLIO, 1997  Sicut dudum  Slave raids continued in the islands during 1435 and Eugene issued a further edict (Sicut dudum) that affirmed the ban on enslavement, and ordered, under pain of excommunication, that all such slaves be immediately set free: > We order and command all and each of the faithful of each sex, within the > space of fifteen days of the publication of these letters in the place where > they live, that they restore to their earlier liberty all and each person of > either sex who were once residents of said Canary Islands, and made captives > since the time of their capture, and who have been made subject to slavery. > These people are to be totally and perpetually free, and are to be let go > without the exaction or reception of money.Panzer, Joel S., Appendix B of > Fr. Joel S. Panzer's book, \\"The Popes and Slavery\\", Appendix B, Society of > St. Paul, 1996 Eugene went on to say that, \\"If this is not done when the fifteen days have passed, they incur the sentence of excommunication by the act itself, from which they cannot be absolved, except at the point of death, even by the Holy See, or by any Spanish bishop, or by the aforementioned Ferdinand, unless they have first given freedom to these captive persons and restored their goods.\\"Pope Eugene IV, Sicut Dudm, §4, Florence, 13 January 1435 The specific reference to Spanish bishops and Bishop Ferdinand of San Marcial del Rubicón in Lanzarote suggests that the Portuguese were not the only ones engaged in slave raids in the Canaries. Joel S. Panzer views Sicut dudum as a significant condemnation of slavery, issued sixty years before the Europeans found the New World.Panzer, Joel S., \\"The Popes and Slavery\\", Homiletic & Pastoral Review, December 1996 Eugene tempered Sicut dudum with another bull (15 September 1436) due to the complaints made by King Duarte of Portugal, that allowed the Portuguese to conquer any unconverted parts of the Canary Islands. The king suggested that Portugal be authorized to evangelize and civilize the islands, as other less reputable persons were unlikely to heed the pontiff. Political weakness compelled the Renaissance Papacy to adopt an acquiescent and unchallenging position when approached for requests for privileges in favour of these ventures. Without a navy of his own to police the islands, the Pope opted in favor of the Portuguese as the lesser of two evils.Stogre, Michael. That the World May Believe: The Development of Papal Social Thought on Aboriginal Rights, Chap. 2, \\"Alexander Vi and the bulls of Demarcation\\", p.65, Médiaspaul, 1992 In 1476 Pope Sixtus IV reiterated the concerns expressed in \\"Sicut dudum\\" in his papal bull, Regimini gregis, in which he threatened to excommunicate all captains or pirates who enslaved Christians.

Such ice divides are important for geochronological investigations using ice cores, because such coring is typically made at highest point of an ice sheet dome in order to avoid the disturbance arising from horizontal ice movement. Ice divides are used for looking at what the atmosphere was like over time. Coring at dome peaks increases accuracy because it is the place where horizontal motion is at its least. The Raymond Effect operates at ice divides, creating anticlines in the radar-detected isochrones, allowing greater capture of older ice when coring. Analysis of ice cores relies on the downward motion of ice, trapping gases over time into its layers. Scientist locate ice divides and take ice cores from them, which are typically long cylindrical poles of ice, and analyse them. Once they have acquired these ice cores, they are able to look through them and find chemical elements that the snow and ice transported during that time period, e.g. sulfate, nitrate, and other ions. The ice cores are important in determining how our atmosphere has changed for the better or worse, and how we can remedy changes such as the greenhouse effect which was discovered when scientist found more greenhouse gases was in our atmosphere at present compared with the past.University of Copenhagen. (2012). Centre for Ice and Climate. Retrieved December 6, 2012 (dead link) Scientists from around the United States came together to find the best ice divide in order to go the further into the past. They formed the WAIS project. This project is funded by the United States National Science Foundation, and is run by scientists from many organizations such as National Ice Core Laboratory, Ice Drilling Design and Operations (IDDO), and over fifty Universities. The WAIS project is located in West Antarctica, and the goal is to look into the past 100,000 years. WAIS is better than other ice divides because of the amount of snow it gets. This large amount of snow causes there to be a very small off-set between the ages of the ice to the air and gases trapped inside. This allows scientists to give much more precise statements about what the atmosphere was like in the past. If the WAIS project is a success it will educate scientists around the world how the atmosphere of Earth has changed completely over 100,000 years.

Rose is a Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California, Irvine. Michael Roberson Rose was born on July 25th 1955. He obtained his B.S. in 1975 from Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada. In 1976 he obtained his M.S.. In 1978 he obtained his Ph.D from the University of Sussex. Educational Magazine His Ph.D. advisor was Brian Charlesworth. His main area of work has been the evolution of aging, approached both theoretically and empirically via the technique of experimental evolution. In 1991, he published Evolutionary Biology of Aging exploring a view of the subject based on antagonistic pleiotropy, the hypothesis that aging is caused by genes that have two effects, one acting early in life and the other much later. The genes are favored by natural selection as a result of their early-life benefits, and the costs that accrue much later appear as incidental side-effects that we identify as aging. Dr. Rose has also suggested that aging can stop in a latter stage of life. The field of aging biology is divided between those who think that it will be very difficult to develop technology to postpone human aging and those who expect breakthroughs in this field in the near future. Rose is an outspoken advocate for the former position. Antagonistic pleiotropy The phenomenon was first described by George C. Williams in 1957, but it was Rose who coined the phrase \\"antagonistic pleiotropy\\". Rose's laboratory has conducted the longest-running artificial selection experiment designed to test the theory of antagonistic pleiotropy. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) are being bred for longevity by collecting eggs from the longest-lived flies in each generation. The experiment has run since 1981, and has produced flies with quadruple the original life span. The prediction of the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis was that these long-lived flies would have much lower fertility early in life. The result has been the opposite - that the long-lived flies actually lay more eggs at every stage of life. Rose explains this result in terms of an interaction between genotype and environment. The long-lived flies show other weaknesses that would make them poor competitors in the wild, and perhaps these traits are the true areas of antagonistic pleiotropy. He is one of the biologists featured in the 1995 science documentary Death by Design/The Life and Times of Life and Times. In 1997, Rose was awarded the Busse Research Prize by the World Congress of Gerontology. He has authored The Long Tomorrow: How Advances in Evolutionary Biology Can Help Us Postpone Aging. =Protagonistic pleiotropy= If the effect on fitness of increase in mortality is zero, as is the case after the age when survival affects reproduction, then natural selection does not weed out the tendency for rates of mortality to accelerate with age. The idea that selection for reproduction in youth causes accumulating dysfunction in later adulthood is a commonly accepted explanation for aging. Protagonistic pleiotropy is the opposite effect: beneficial effects in later life as a result of selection for reproduction in earlier life. Rose contends that a correct understanding of Hamilton's equations through mathematical modeling show that protagonistic pleiotropy is plausible.Does Aging Stop?, Laurence D. Mueller, Casandra L. Rauser, Michael R. Rose, Oxford University Press, 2011 Mortality-rate plateaus Rose's most recent book is Does Aging Stop?. W. D. Hamilton advanced the idea that any gene killing an organism before it reproduced would be weeded out by natural selection. However, genes that kill later in life, after reproduction ceases, can remain in the population. For Rose, this suggests that aging is a result of \\"declining forces of natural selection.\\" He points to studies of the demographic data in large-scale fruit fly experiments and actuarial data for humans which he believes support the hypothesis that acceleration in death rates can halt in later life. According to Rose, mortality-rate plateaus have not often been noticed in humans because they are only seen in specific-age cohorts of the very old. His proposed explanation is that at a stage of life beyond the potential to reproduce, the effect of natural selection is no longer falling as it has 'bottomed out'. Rose suggests that if a decline in the effect of natural selection is responsible for aging, then when this decline finally ends, at post-reproductive age, aging could halt. He reasons it follows that aging is \\"not a cumulative process of progressive chemical damage, like rust, at late ages, aging can stop\\". =Human late life= According to Rose, relative to the age of reproductive maturity a transition to the late-life stage of life occurs much later in humans than in the populations of flies for which there are data. In humans, the 'late-life' stage of life is only reached at 90 years old, whereas the data for flies scaled to humans would predict a 'late-life' stage for humans at 40–50 years old. Rose suggests that human populations' adoption of agriculture led to more children surviving to adulthood, and to reproduction occurring later in life. Agriculture is also hypothesized by Rose to have resulted in high population density, thereby increasing the range of ages not under selection. =Books= * Garland, T., Jr., and M. R. Rose, eds.

Though the full technique was invented in 1993 by Tapas Fleming, TAT incorporates elements of and builds on other acupressure techniques. Like other energy therapies, TAT relies on a putative energy for which no scientific basis has been found and no biophysical means of action determined. TAT shows many characteristics consistent with pseudoscience. History Invented in 1993 by Tapas Fleming, the underlying idea claims that unresolved emotional trauma leads to a blockage of the natural flow of putative energy. Practitioners of TAT claim that self application of light pressure to four areas of the head (inner corner of both eyes, one-half-inch above the space between the eyebrows, and the back of head) while placing attention on a series of verbal steps releases this blockage and allows for healing. TAT was originally intended to be an allergy elimination protocol, but the emphasis switched to emotional trauma.  Scientific evaluation  No scientifically plausible method of action is proposed for Tapas Acupressure Technique, instead relying on unvalidated putative energy and meridians with no identified biophysical or histological basis. A 2005 review of so-called \\"Power Therapies\\" concluded that TAT and similar techniques \\"offered no new scientifically valid theories of action, show only non-specific efficacy, show no evidence that they offer substantive improvements to extant psychiatric care, yet display many characteristics consistent with pseudoscience.\\" TAT also conforms to the \\"nine practices of pseudoscience\\" as identified by AR Pratkins.

Tubbs was originally portrayed by Philip Michael Thomas in the television series from 1984 to 1990, and later by Jamie Foxx in the feature film in 2006. Tubbs is an undercover detective for the Metro-Dade Police Department's Organized Crime Bureau, having relocated to Miami from New York City in order to track down his brother's murderer. For the duration of the series, Tubbs is partnered with fellow undercover detective James \\"Sonny\\" Crockett. Tubbs made his first appearance in the show's pilot episode, \\"Brother's Keeper\\", and later went on to appear in all but one of the show's 111 episodes. Thomas' portrayal of Tubbs was well received by fans and critics, and earned him a People's Choice Award and a Golden Globe Award nomination. Tubbs would go on to become a fashion icon, and helped to set a trend for Miami Vice-related clothing. Fictional character biography =Television series= Before coming to Miami, Tubbs was a detective in the Armed Robbery Division of the New York Police Department, along with his older brother Rafael who was a senior detective in the Narcotics Division. At various times during his stint in New York, Tubbs was partnered with detectives Valerie Gordon (Pam Grier) and Clarence Batisse (Victor Love) Tubbs and Gordon were romantically involved, and would sporadically resume their affair throughout the series. Tubbs' relationship with Batisse, however, was much more volatile—after a suspicious shooting during a routine bust, Tubbs' testimony to Internal Affairs resulted in Batisse's dismissal. Batisse would, however, eventually be exonerated thanks to Tubbs' aid. Rafael's murder at the hands of drug lord Esteban Calderone (Miguel Piñero) led Tubbs to Miami, where he eventually teamed up with the Metro-Dade Organized Crime Bureau. Calderone was apprehended, but managed to bribe a judge to escape custody. Later, when trying to track the drug lord again, Tubbs sleeps with Angelina Madeira (Phanie Napoli), Calderone's daughter. Upon confronting the drug lord, Crockett and Tubbs are caught in a shoot-out, which ends when Crockett shoots Calderone dead. Several months later, Angelina surfaces again, having had a child as a result of her fling with Tubbs. However, her brother Orlando (John Leguizamo) has also located Tubbs, wanting revenge for his father's death. Tubbs' son, Ricardo Jr, is kidnapped, and Angelina killed, before Orlando escapes. Orlando reappears after luring Tubbs to a remote Caribbean island, hoping to trap and kill him. Tubbs is able to evade Orlando's gang, however, and escapes after killing his pursuer in a shoot-out. In stark contrast to Crockett, who drives expensive Ferraris and carries high-tech handguns as part of his cover, Tubbs exudes a more tough, street-smart New Yorker image, driving a metallic blue 1964 Cadillac de Ville convertible, and carrying cheaper, more readily available weapons, his primary weapon being a snubnosed Smith & Wesson Bodyguard revolver, and as a secondary weapon, he carried a sawed-off side by side shotgun during Season 1 and later an Ithaca 37 \\"Stakeout\\" shotgun with shortened barrel and forward pistol grip. Compared to his partner, Tubbs' cool demeanor helps him avoid much of the burnout Crockett would experience after the killing of his wife Caitlin and his brief amnesia. However, getting rejected by Valerie after proposing marriage eventually takes a toll on Tubbs too, and coupled with him and Crockett feeling disappointed in how they were treated by the government regarding their involvement in the case of protecting Costa Morada dictator Manuel Borbon, Tubbs and Crockett end up resigning from the force. He then meets up with Crockett one last time, and Crockett offers him a ride to the airport in his \\"stolen\\" Ferrari, as Tubbs decides to head \\"back up to the big bad Bronx\\". Tubbs is bilingual in English and Spanish. =Film= In the 2006 film adaptation of Miami Vice, Ricardo Tubbs is portrayed by Jamie Foxx and is in a relationship with fellow Vice Detective Trudy Joplin, who is portrayed by Naomie Harris. Tubbs' past is not revealed in the film. He is shown to be urbane, level-headed and a smooth- talker like the television version, but with the additions of being more gritty, world weary, and a skilled pilot. Production Tubbs, along with his partner Crockett, have been cited as being influenced by the characters of David Starsky and Kenneth Hutchinson from the 1970s series Starsky and Hutch, several episodes of which were written by Miami Vice producers Michael Mann and Anthony Yerkovich; and the duo of Bobby Hill and Andy Renko from Hill Street Blues. The film 48 Hrs. has also been seen as an influence on the characters. Tubbs represents a \\"neo-populist sneering at the worlds of finance and politics\\", his New York back-story helping to convey \\"a sociological explanation of crime\\". Mann originally conceived the character of Ricardo Tubbs as \\"nobody's Tonto\\", claiming that this is what drove the character for most of the first season. However, he felt that \\"for reasons that had to do with the two actors and one thing or the other, that eroded a little bit\\" over the course of the series. Jodie Tillen, the show's costume designer, described the character as being \\"formal\\" and \\"self-conscious\\" of his image, contrasting with the \\"beach bum\\" look of the character of Crockett. Thomas has also described Tubbs as being \\"sharp as a tack\\". Themes Beyond his role as the \\"cynical, worldly\\", even \\"skeptical\\" outsider, Tubbs has been seen as exemplifying the lure of the very things his job pits him against. Writing about the character's development over the first few seasons, James Lyons describes Tubbs as being \\"rather enchanted\\" by the thrills of his undercover work, noting his off-duty relationships with suspects and other individuals related to his cases in episodes such as \\"Evan\\", \\"The Great McCarthy\\" and the two-part \\"Calderone's Return\\". Lyons feels that this arc ends in the latter half of the second season, sensing that Tubbs' \\"weariness\\" and sense of loss begin to set in after witnessing the suicide of a prostitute he had tried to rescue in the episode \\"Little Miss Dangerous\\", and both the apparent death of his infant son and the actual death of the child's mother in the episode \\"Sons and Lovers\\". David Buxton reinforces this view, noting that, in the series, \\"the line between normality and vice, between 'good' and 'bad'... is so blurred as to be non-existent at times\\"; whilst Arthur Kean Spears' Race and Ideology: Language, Symbolism, and Popular Culture claims that \\"what Tubbs seems to lack in actual Miami vice experience, his life experience makes up for\\". Reception The New York Times has called the character \\"dissolute but human, gritty but glamorous\\", noting that two decades after the show's end, \\"Tubbs still look[s] very cool\\". Time magazine called Thomas' casting \\"inspired\\", noting that his easy-going nature provided a \\"sharp contrast\\" to Johnson's Crockett. The National Review echoed this sentiment, noting that \\"Tubbs, for example, seemed so much happier than the perennially haunted Crockett ... but there was never any question about the bond they shared\\". Turner Classic Movies have noted Thomas' \\"unique\\" and \\"engaging\\" portrayal of the role, stating that \\"his popularity crossed gender and racial lines\\", making \\"an indelible mark, \\" on viewers. New York Magazine, however, simply noted the character as \\"an acceptable Sidney Poitier facsimile\\". Tubbs, along with Crockett, was named as one of Entertainment Weekly's \\"25 Terrific TV Detectives\\" in 2009. When the first season of Miami Vice became a \\"breakthrough hit\\", the \\"smooth and swinging\\" character of Tubbs became a style icon—Bloomingdale's reported \\"noticeable\\" rises in the sales of blazers and jackets; whilst Kenneth Cole brought out \\"Crockett\\" and \\"Tubbs\\" shoes, and Macy's opened a \\"Miami Vice\\" young men's section The National Review's Andrew Stuttford has described the impact of the character's style as an \\"escape from the monotone restraints of conventional detective drama\\", noting that its influence \\"transformed notions of what television could do\\". The character of Tubbs has also been referenced and parodied in popular culture. The Sesame Street \\"Miami Mice\\" segment featured the character Tito, who was modelled on Tubbs. The character is also referenced in episodes of The Sopranos, Family Guy, K-Ville, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, as well as the 2007 film Hot Fuzz. Thomas' portrayal of Tubbs earned the actor several award nominations. In 1986, he and Johnson shared a People's Choice Award for their work on the show, whilst in that same year he was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series - Drama, although he did not win.

The film stars Aaron Kwok, Phyllis Quek, James Lye and Daniel Wu. The film was shot on location in both Hong Kong and Singapore. Released in Hong Kong on 3 February 2000, the film was timed to screen during the peak Chinese New Year period. Plot A private plane belonging to the TDX company is shot down over Singapore by a rogue agent from the CIA, Kelvin Woo. The company president was coming to investigate a stolen computer protection system. Kelvin has a programmer, Alex, plant a bug in the 1st National Bank's computer system, but he still needs a \\"Caller Program\\" to wipe the systems before they can rob the bank. Colonel Ng, head of the Army's Information Warfare Unit, recruits Major Eric Ong from the Singapore Police to investigate the plane shooting independently from the US authorities. Eric is sent to Hong Kong to quietly observe. In Hong Kong, brothers Peter and Greg Li are computer programmers. However, Peter's girlfriend Janet and her brother Bobby live with them. Greg calls his girlfriend, Salina. She tells him that her office was raided by the CIA. Ronald Ng of the Hong Kong Police Force Government Security Unit raids Greg's home, with him are Kelvin and his accomplice, representing the CIA. Eric watches from the street. While searching, an emp bomb is triggered, which disables all the electronics in the house. The brothers are arrested, and an American diplomat interrogates Greg while Ronald listens in. It turns out Greg is a CIA agent and asked for help from the embassy. Greg suspects the CIA has been compromised and that TDX may be implicated. Kelvin finds Greg's computer was wiped clean by the ion bomb. Peter is released, but Greg is to be deported back to the States. As the vehicles leave the embassy, Peter sees his brother and waves goodbye. Suddenly, a rocket hits one of the vehicles, flipping it on to Greg's vehicle. All the officers are killed by sniper fire. Kelvin, in the car behind Greg's, sits quietly while everyone else panics. A devastated Peter follows Ronald as he chases the sniper but find himself running ahead of the officers. The sniper fires at Peter until he runs out of bullets. Meanwhile, Peter knowing the sniper is out, attacks him. Kelvin arrives and is about to shoot Peter when PTU officers show up. Kelvin then pretends to help Peter while the sniper escapes. Kelvin offers his help and gives Peter his number. As Peter drives home with Janet, he notices a car following them. He confronts the driver, who turns out to be Eric. He reveals he is a Singaporean agent and asks Peter to help him investigate his brother's death. When Peter gets home, he finds that the house is swarming with police as part of the investigation. An officer breaks a large vase, spilling coins all over the floor. Salina arrives with her friend, a judge, who prevents further searching. When the coins are later cleaned up, a key to Greg's safe deposit box is found. Salina advises Peter to check the contents right away. She helps him forge his brother's identity, and they find it holds a metal briefcase. They take the briefcase but are arrested by Ronald outside the bank. While being driven away the GSU vehicles are attacked by assailants trying to steal the briefcase. In the gun battle several are killed, including Ronald. Just before he dies, Ronald warns Peter about Salina. Peter is forced to kill an assailant, while the sniper from earlier is stopped by Eric, who had just arrived. In the car, Salina opens the briefcase and finds a safe deposit box key for the Singapore National Bank. Peter decides to go to Singapore with Salina, despite Eric's objections. Eric tells Colonel Ng he believes the GSU were attacked by Kelvin, while confirming Peter's innocence and his suspicions about Salina. Colonel Ng is upset about his involvement in the gun battle and demands he returns to Singapore. Peter's locks the key in the hotel room's safe. He obviously distrusts Salina, while she becomes colder. They have a confrontation over dinner and Peter demands to know her identity. However, Salina tearfully reveals her car thief skills from being a hooker in a night club, where she met Greg. On the following morning, Salina and the key are missing. The others rush to the bank, where they see Salina leaving the bank, accompanied by the man Peter recognises as the sniper who shot his brother. The two leave in a red vehicle, while the others rush out to get help from some nearby policemen. Frustrated, Peter steals the police car while Bobby stops the policeman, who calls for backup. Eric hears the radio message and rushes to the scene. Peter chases the car to the Boat Quay, where he rams it. Eric and three other officers intercept the sniper's car and have a gun battle. As Peter reaches the scene, Salina fires at his feet to stop him. A speedboat is hijacked and all three, including Salina, escape up the Singapore River. Eric tells Peter and his friends that they need to go back to Hong Kong and Eric asks Peter not to reveal his identity. The contents of the safe are shown to Kelvin, but it only contains items of sentimental value to Salina. Disgusted, he reminds her that she belongs to him, she was the one who stole the Caller Program. He threatens to kill her, erasing all evidence. At the airport, Bobby finds a mysterious program implanted on his laptop. Alex successfully completes the Caller Program, and destroys the data for several organisations, including the Stock Exchange and National Bank, their intended target. Kelvin is upset that the second part will take a month to finish. He gets a call from an unsuspecting Peter, who tells him about the program in Bobby's laptop and asks for his assistance. They arrange to meet at a hotel, where the sniper is positioned on a nearby rooftop. A waiter offers them water and Peter is surprised to see it is Eric. With increased confidence, he demands information on Salina and his brother's killer. Kelvin asks that they move to a quieter area. While on the way out, he pokes gun in Peter's back, who finally realises who his brother's killer really is. Eric pursues and they fight on the hotel roof. The sniper pins Eric down. As they fight for the laptop, Peter falls off the roof, but is saved by a window washing platform, while Kelvin escapes with the laptop. Bobby sees Kelvin leaving and tails him in a taxi. Kelvin and two agents arrive at Suntec City, where they meet Salina and four others. Bobby calls Peter to tell him where they are, but he loses the agents, only to be captured by them later. Peter and several officers arrive at the Convention Centre, but Eric receives a call from Colonel Ng, who surprises him by asking him to arrest all the American agents. He has confirmation that they are operating without approval. The agents find Alex at his computer where he reports he completed his task. Kelvin shoots him and is about to shoot Bobby when Salina points her gun at Kelvin. As the other agents react, one of them, who was sympathetic towards Salina, stops them. Salina and Bobby leave with the laptop. Eric and his men cover the exits. Salina and Bobby stay among the exhibits, while rogue agents hunt for them. Bobby tells Peter their location and they rush in to help. Kelvin sees the officers and Peter converging on Bobby's hideout. Kelvin and the sniper sneak up on Bobby and Salina, who start to struggle, causing Bobby to be shot by Kelvin, sparking mayhem. In the chaos Eric manages to gun down several CIA agents while Kelvin grabs the laptop and tries to escape. He takes some civilians hostage and forces them to run the software. He shoots a hostage and the police are forced to withdraw. In a fit of rage, Peter rushes Kelvin and is shot. He aim his gun at Kelvin, but hesitates and Kelvin triggers the program's deletion process, which reveals a snapshot of Peter and Bobby, a hoax they planted instead of the program. Peter takes a shot at Kelvin, but the gun jams. The closing scenes show Peter with paramedics outside the Convention Centre. Eric tells Peter he is lucky the gun jammed otherwise he would have been a murderer. Kelvin is assumed to be arrested and the sniper is seen quietly walking away from the crowd. Salina compliments Bobby for his bravery while on the way to the hospital.

As trucks go, the Caterpillar 'Goer' stands out, due to being articulated, much wider than other trucks, and lacking suspension on the wheels. Some 1,300 of these trucks were built from 1972 to 1976. The majority were M520 Cargo Trucks. The tankers were designated M559 Fuel Servicing Tanker Truck, and the wreckers M553 Wrecker Truck. When fitted with its own crane, the cargo variant was designated M877 Cargo Truck with Material Handling Crane. Overview In the mid-1950s, the US military were looking for a new, extreme off-road, tactical truck series, with substantially increased load- carrying capacity. According to a May 2006 article in Classic Military Vehicle magazine, the United States Armor Board began evaluating and testing commercially available, large, wheeled, articulated-steering, earth-moving equipment for potential tactical application in 1956 / 1957. This resulted in development contracts for 4x4 all-terrain vehicles of various weight classes being awarded to Clark Equipment, Le Tourneau-Westinghouse, and Caterpillar Tractor Company. Clark provided a 5-ton prototype, based on their Model 75 log-skidder, powered by a Cummins 6-cyl. diesel engine. Caterpillar's entries were in the eight-ton class and were designated: XM520 (8-ton cargo truck), XM553 (10-ton wrecker recovering), and XM559 (8-ton, 2,500-gallon tanker). Le Tourneau-Westinghouse offered three variants in the 15-ton class: XM437 Cargo, XM438 Tanker, and XM554 Wrecker. Without exception, the prototypes consisted of two segments: housing engine and driver's compartment in the front and using the rear part as main transport unit, whereby steering was accomplished by articulating the whole front unit relative to the rear, as opposed to pivot steering the front wheels conventionally. The large wheels with large, low- pressure tires were mounted without any suspension or steering mechanism, greatly simplifying the design. In order to keep the wheels on the ground on uneven terrain, the front and rear units could not only swivel around a vertical axis, but also along the vehicle's longitudinal axis, allowing significant articulation. In low gear ranges, the Goer had four-wheel drive capability, but on-road it was purely front-wheel drive. The Caterpillar design did well in testing, and in 1960, the company was awarded a multimillion-dollar contract for developing eight 8-ton cargo trucks, delivered in 1961 and 1962, as well as two 10-ton wreckers and two 2500-gallon tankers in 1962. Another twenty-three units were ordered in 1963, then field- tested in Germany in 1964 and in Vietnam in 1966. Production of official variants Not until 1971 did Caterpillar eventually receive a production contract for 1300 units: 812 M520 cargo-vehicles, 371 M559 tankers and 117 M553 wreckers. Production began in 1972 and lasted through June 1976. When fitted with its own crane, the cargo variant would be designated M877. All variants except the wrecker existed both with or without front winch, whereas all wreckers had winches both front and rear. Early units, with a Cat D333 engine, were multi-fuel, but later ones, with the D333C powerplant, were diesel only. The M520 in water, showing both its articulation and buoyancy. Field performance Not only did the Caterpillar offer extreme off-road ability, including 20° longitudinal articulation and 30° side-slopes, it was also fully amphibious, using the wheels for propulsion in the water. The rear cargo-bed tailgate and drop-side doors, that allowed rapid discharge of cargo, had watertight seals to preserve the unit's swimming capability. In the US’s involvement in the Vietnam War, the Goer developed a reputation of being able to go where other trucks could not, and it was one of the preferred resupply vehicles after the pre-production units' introduction in 1966. They achieved a 90% availability rate even though spare parts for the Goer were not an official part of the US Army inventory until 1972. Nevertheless, the vehicle's lack of suspension made it too bouncy on hardened surfaces, making most drivers shy away from its 31 mph (50 km/h) top speed. The method for keeping bounce to a minimum on hard roads was to gently sway the vehicle left and right at top speed. The bilge pumps were often abused on hard road convoys as \\"super-squirters\\" by bored drivers as they would accumulate water in the hull and drivers soon realized havoc could be raised by turning on the high volume pumps to douse passing and oncoming traffic. The oscillating cab was also dangerous as entering or exiting the vehicle with the engine off could put pressure on the steering wheel and when the engine was started the cab would turn without warning. Also its oversize dimensions proved generally awkward, so in the 1980s it was replaced by the Oshkosh Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck series, that combined good on-road behavior with adequate off- road performance. As the Goers were surplused accordingly, it was done so under a demilitarization order similar to that of the M151 jeep. Core components in the steering and driveline were destroyed before the remains of the vehicle were sold off. Consequently, only very few vehicles remained in existence, in museums and private collections.

He became famous for founding the royal manufacture of printed cottons of Jouy-en-Josas where the toile de Jouy was manufactured. Bust of Oberkampf in the garden of the town hall of Jouy-in-Josas Oberkampf was born in Wiesenbach,Today this village is part of the town of Blaufelden in the district of Schwäbisch Hall of the state of Baden-Württemberg: see on German Wikipedia. Germany, into a family of dyers. He traveled to educate himself and initially worked in Mulhouse as an engraver, then from October 1758 in Paris as a colourist.  Career  = 18th century =  1759–1770s  In 1759, Oberkampf proposed a partnership with the Swiss for the creation of a manufacture of cottons printed with engraved wood boards in Jouy-in-Josas. The first fabrics were successfully printed in May 1760. In 1764, Oberkampf increased his factory to a vast area of 18,000 m². The number of employees grew quickly and reached 900 workmen in 1774. In 1770, Oberkampf who had then lived in France for ten years, was made a naturalised French citizen, along with his brother. Around this period, an important technical evolution enabled his company to considerably increase its production: the wooden boards were replaced with copper plates, also engraved, but flexible and able to be fixed on cylindrical drums. The company entered the era of mechanisation. Until 1789, he was the businesspartner of Alexandre Sarrasin de Maraise, whose wife Marie-Catherine de Maraise took care of his interests and had an able companionship with Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf. 1780s–1790s In 1783, the factory received from king Louis XVI of France the title of \\"royal manufacturer\\" and in 1787, Oberkampf received from the king the title of squire as well as the right to use arms and his device \\"Recte et vigilanter (uprightness and vigilance)\\". In 1785 Oberkampf invented the first machine for printing wallpaper, and shortly afterwards, Nicolas-Louis Robert designed a process for manufacturing endless rolls of wall-paper. On February 7, 1790, the reforms of the French Revolution led him to be appointed mayor of Jouy-en-Josas. In 1794 his daughter Émilie was born. Influenced by the British Infant Schools, she would become the pioneer of the nursery school. The factory continued to flourish during the Revolution and became the second company of the kingdom after the mirror manufacture of Saint-Gobain. In 1799, sales declined and the manpower – which had reached 2,000 workers – was reduced. = 19th century = In 1806, Oberkampf won a gold medal at the industrial fair of the Louvre for its eminent role in the manufacture of painted Toiles. On June 20, 1806, after visiting the workshops, Napoleon, awarded him the legion of honor. Decrease in the demand and competition got more insistent. In 1815, manpower fell to 435, and the manufacture was closed during the invasion of the armies united against the Emperor. Death and legacy When Oberkampf died in 1815 in Jouy- en-Josas (today in Yvelines), his son Emile succeeded him as the head of the company. Taken over by Jacques-Juste Barbet de Jouy in 1822, it finally went bankrupt in 1843. Oberkampf was buried in the garden of his house, which today houses the Music Academy of Jouy-in-Josas. Oberkampf's name was given to a Rue Oberkampf in the 11th arrondissement of Paris, and to the Oberkampf subway station that serves it.

S. Wiley. The protocol claims to relieve the symptoms of menopause but is also promoted as increasing overall health through the recreation of a pre-menopausal woman's monthly hormonal cycle using rhythmic doses of hormones standardized to a uniform purity. Wiley claims the protocol is a step beyond the symptomatic treatment of conventional hormone replacement therapy. The protocol has been criticized by members of the medical community for the dosages of the hormones used, side effects of the treatment, potential physiologic effects, Wiley's lack of medical or clinical qualifications to design the protocol, lack of empirical evidence demonstrating it as safe or effective, ethical problems with the clinical trial that is being run to test it and potential financial conflicts of interest regarding financial incentives. Specific dosing The Wiley Protocol uses bioidentical hormones, specifically estradiol and progesterone. Hormones are applied transdermally, using an oil-based skin cream for topical administration. Doses of the hormones vary throughout a 28-day cycle that is designed to mimic the hormone levels and changes of a young woman who experiences regular menstruation, with each hormone cycling and peaking at separate times throughout the period. The protocol is promoted as differing from conventional hormone replacement therapy in several ways: * The use of plant-derived hormones that are identical to endogenous hormones found in the body, rather than the synthetic derivatives of conventional hormone replacement therapy such as premarin * A dose that varies over a 28-day cycle rather than remaining static * Topical rather than oral administration The protocol also includes a follow-up program to monitor the serum of the bioidentical hormones. Wiley has stated that in her opinion, the most important aspect of the protocol is the specific schedule and levels of the hormone doses rather than their bioidentical nature. A patent was granted for the protocol in 2011 for the specific blend of hormones and dosing method. Criticism Concerns have been raised that serum levels may not be an acceptable marker for transdermally administered hormones, that some women have experienced significant side effects while following the protocol and have stopped using it, and that the dosages used are too high and not physiologic. T. S. Wiley and Suzanne Somers have been criticized by some physicians for their advocacy of the Wiley Protocol. A group of seven doctors issued a public letter to Somers and her publisher, Crown, in which they state that the protocol is \\"scientifically unproven and dangerous\\" and cite Wiley's lack of medical and clinical qualifications. The Wiley Protocol has been criticized as unethical due to the start of a Phase II clinical trial with no Phase I, a lack of approval by an institutional review board, a lack of an experienced scientific investigator leading the trial, no inclusion or exclusion criteria and no evidence that the study population has been told that the research has not passed an ethical review, as well as concerns over conflicts of interest regarding financial incentives.

João Afonso\`s writings and Cosmographies (also based on his previous voyages to the East and the West) inspired and helped the Dieppe School in France The Dauphin Map of Canada, circa 1543, showing Cartier's discoveries and explorations. A region explored by the pilot Jean Alfonse in 1542-43 Born João Afonso and later known in France as Jean Fonteneau or Alfonse of Saintonge, he married a woman named Victorine Alfonse (Victorina Alfonso). Taking to the sea at age 12, he joined the Portuguese India Armadas and the Portuguese commercial fleets as they sailed past the seven seas to the coasts of Brasil, Western Africa, and around the Cape to Madagascar and Asia. His writings talk of days lasting three months, and of a vast southern continent, the Terra Australis, and the Jave la Grande, which he claims to have seen south of Southeast Asia, possibly suggesting he had approached the Arctic (by North America), Australia, and Antarctica.  In service of France  Before or around 1530, for some reasons, he moved to France putting himself at the service of Francis I. The correspondence of diplomatic agents of the king of Portugal in France, in the first half of the century, tried to clarify the causes of this change of allegiance. Gaspar Palha, a Portuguese diplomat in Paris in 1531, having met a man from La Rochelle to whom he requested information concerning the pilot Jean Alfonse, wrote that he had been exiled because, when he was lost near the coast of Brittany hit by a storm, he had been involved in a quarrel (according to what was reported, with his own oldest son) that resulted in the death of his son or some man aboard; and that consequently he had been exiled and did not dare to appear in public, but it is a report by indirect testimony, and there may have been other non-criminal reasons for the exile. However, it appears that it was to escape the Portuguese Justice for some reason. Jean Alfonse left the country, later in the company of his wife and his sons. In 1531, John III attempted to repatriate the defector pilot because of his high qualifications and for his vast and possible classified knowledge.

The king himself corresponded directly with Afonso, sending letters of pardon by his ambassadors and representatives and later exchanging letters with him in this attempt. By the 1540s, he was a renowned pilot, leading fleets to Africa and the Caribbean and reputed to have never lost a ship. André Thévet mentions a conversation where Alfonse described looting Puerto Rico as a corsair. It was long thought that the Rabelaisian hero Xenomanes was based on Alfonse. In 1542-43, Alfonse piloted Jean-François de la Roque de Roberval's attempt to colonize Canada on the heels of Jacques Cartier's third voyage there. Alfonse established that one could sail through a passage between Greenland and Labrador. The crew of 200, including prisoners and a few women, spent a harsh winter on the shores of the St. Lawrence River, hit by scurvy and losing a quarter of the colonists before sailing back to France. During this trip, Alfonse described a land he called Norombega.DeCosta, 1890, p. 99. Part of Abraham Ortelius atlas from 1570, showing \\"Norvmbega\\" among other more or less mythical names for various areas (as well as several phantom islands) In late 1544, Alfonse left La Rochelle with a small fleet and disrupted Basque shipping, while the treaty of Crépy had just been signed between France and Spain. A Spanish fleet led by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés caught up to him as he was getting back to La Rochelle and killed him at sea. Some sources say this fatal encounter occurred in 1549.Philip P.

This could be done electronically or through certain systems. These are terms that can either refer to bidirectional information transfer in telecommunications and computer science or communication seen from a system-theoretic or information-theoretic point of view. As, \\"information,\\" in this context invariably refers to (electronic) data that encodes and represents the information at hand, a broader treatment can be found under data exchange. Information exchange has a long history in information technology. Traditional information sharing referred to one-to-one exchanges of data between a sender and receiver. Online information sharing gives useful data to businesses for future strategies based on online sharing. These information exchanges are implemented via dozens of open and proprietary protocols, message, and file formats. Electronic data interchange (EDI) is a successful implementation of commercial data exchanges that began in the late 1970s and remains in use today. Some controversy comes when discussing regulations regarding information exchange. Initiatives to standardize information sharing protocols include extensible markup language (XML), simple object access protocol (SOAP), and web services description language (WSDL). From the point of view of a computer scientist, the four primary information sharing design patterns are sharing information one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and many-to-one. Technologies to meet all four of these design patterns are evolving and include blogs, wikis, really simple syndication, tagging, and chat. One example of United States government's attempt to implement one of these design patterns (one to one) is the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM).NIEM One-to-one exchange models fall short of supporting all of the required design patterns needed to fully implement data exploitation technology. Advanced information sharing platforms provide controlled vocabularies, data harmonization, data stewardship policies and guidelines, standards for uniform data as they relate to privacy, security, and data quality. Information Sharing, Intelligence Reform, and Terrorism Prevention Act The term information sharing gained popularity as a result of the 9/11 Commission Hearings and its report of the United States government's lack of response to information known about the planned terrorist attack on the New York City World Trade Center prior to the event. The resulting commission report led to the enactment of several executive orders by President Bush that mandated agencies implement policies to \\"share information\\" across organizational boundaries. In addition, an Information Sharing Environment Program Manager (PM-ISE) was appointed, tasked to implement the provisions of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. In making recommendation toward the creation of an \\"Information Sharing Environment\\" the 9/11 Commission based itself on the findings and recommendations made by the Markle Task Force on National Security in the Information Age.Markle Task Force on National Security in the Information Age See also *Channel (communications) *Communications protocol *Sexual recombination enables cross-pollination in bio *Data mapping *Electronic Data Interchange *Fusion center *Information Exchange Gateway *Knowledge Sharing *Semi-structured data *Data interchange standards *Health Information Exchange *Cyberinfrastructure References Category:Information theory Category:Sharing ","title":"Information exchange"},{"id":"10677756","text":"Shannon Paku (born 23 September 1980)Shannon Paku player profile ESPN Scrfum.com is a former New Zealand rugby union player.

As such, the bird could be described as common in its local habitat. The name \\"woodswallow\\" is a misnomer as they are not closely related to true swallows. Instead, they belong to the family Artamidae, which also includes butcherbirds, currawongs and the Australian magpie. Taxonomy The dusky woodswallow was first described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 with the binomial name Loxia cyanoptera. Its specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek words cyanos 'blue' and pteron 'wing'. Description The dusky woodswallow is medium-sized and swallow-like, with a dark brown hue, but there have been instances where the bird has appeared grey. The birds have a black patch in front of the eyes, and grey (sometimes also black) wings with white streaks on them. The dusky woodswallow has a black, white-tipped tail with a silver underwing. The birds have a blue-grey bill capped with black. Dusky woodswallows are known to spontaneously 'wag' or swivel their tales fervently, a trait which is common among many other species of woodswallow. =Relations to other woodswallows= In a significant difference from other woodswallows, dusky woodswallows have a distinctive white patch on the outer wing. Dusky woodswallows also seem to typically be more smoky brown than other species of woodswallow. The little woodswallow, a smaller, darker woodswallow is also slightly more smoky brown that other woodswallows, but that is the only similarity that the latter has with the dusky woodswallow; the little woodswallow does not share a white patch on the outer wing. Distribution and habitat In Tasmania The birds live primarily in open eucalyptus forests and woodlands. They range mostly from Atherton Tableland, Queensland, down to Tasmania and west to Eyre Peninsula, in South Australia. They roost communally, usually nocturnally. During the breeding season, they nest in large flocks to make sure to keep predators away from young. These flocks can be 20–30 dusky woodswallows in size. Dusky woodswallows adhere to seasonal migration and movements. The birds are a nomadic species, and tend to move quite spontaneously. However, one certain change of habitat occurs for the south-eastern birds, who migrate northward for Autumn. Communally roosting birds, the dusky woodswallow has a variety of chattering calls which are used in certain situations. The most distinctive of these calls is perhaps the one which is used when a predator or intruder approaches, which consists of a harsh mobbing call to warn others. Feeding and diet The diet of the bird can be varied. They eat various forms of foliage and other grassy material that they find on the ground on in trees and shrubs. Dusky woodswallows have been seen eating termites, butterflies and other insects. They also eat nectar from flowers. One notable aspect of their feeding habits is the way they hunt flying insects, which is done by picking them up on their wing. They do, however, also eat their prey from the ground, and they often find inconspicuous places to perch while waiting for prey, such as utility lines and the like. They have also been observed engaging in kleptoparasitism, working as a group to rob a restless flycatcher of its prey. Kleptoparasitism is extremely unusual in passerine birds, as is cooperative kleptoparasitsim in general. Breeding Parent feeding chicks a wasp The nest of the dusky woodswallow consists of twigs, roots and other similar foliage matted together to form a bowl shape, which is lined with grass. It is positioned safely, behind bark, and/or high in a tree branch, and sometimes in a hollowed out tree stump. The nest is made during the period from August to January, and with the help of several birds. The mated pair will then guard the nest, while others will help them take care of the babies. The female lays white eggs, of which there are usually no more than three or four. While the incubation period lasts for sixteen days, the amount of time taken for fledgling can be this long to around twenty days. The typical clutch is three to four in size, but this may vary. Conservation status The dusky woodswallow has a very large range. The population size of this bird has not yet been quantified or estimated. It is, however, expected to be as populous as other birds within its densest range labeled 'common'. Because of this, the dusky woodswallow is evaluated to be of Least Concern (LC). This classification may change with new evidence, so is not to be taken with complete accuracy. See also *List of Australian birds References Further reading *del Hoyo, Josep, A. Elliott, J.

He was the father of Sir Thomas Gresham. Biography The Gresham family crest The Gresham family had been settled in the Norfolk village of Gresham since at least the late 14th Century. Richard Gresham's grandfather, James Gresham, moved to Holt, Norfolk, about three miles from Gresham, where in the mid- fifteenth century he built a manor house in the centre of the small town.. Richard Gresham, born about 1485 at Holt, was probably the third of four surviving sons of James Gresham's son, John Gresham, by his marriage to Alice Blythe of Long Stratton, Norfolk. Gresham was admitted a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Mercers in 1507. As a mercer, he was in partnership with his brother, John Gresham, in exporting textiles and importing grain from the continent. He supplied King Henry VIII with arras, velvets, and satins. Most of his trade was with the Low Countries, which were the most significant area for English overseas trade for most of the sixteenth century, and he amassed a large fortune. He became Sheriff of London and Middlesex in 1531, and was knighted the same year. On 19 May 1536, he was present at the execution of Anne Boleyn in the Tower of London. He was elected as Lord Mayor of London in 1537, and when Cardinal Wolsey was on his death bed he called Gresham his \\"fast-friend\\". Gresham paid for the Cardinal's funeral. He was elected as one of the four Members of Parliament for the City of London in 1539 and 1545. Gresham supplied tapestries to Cardinal Wolsey for his new house of Hampton Court. In October 1520 he measured eighteen rooms and went to the mart in Flanders to order hangings to the value of 1000 marks or more. In part payment, in January 1521, Gresham asked Wolsey to obtain a licence for him to profit by international trade, including the right to send a ship to Turkey. Margaret, Duchess of Savoy, impounded one of his ships carrying wheat from Antwerp. Gresham asked Wolsey to sign a letter in his support in March 1521, and wrote that he had obtained eight cloths-of-gold for hanging in the Cardinal's closet at Hampton Court.Ellis, Henry, ed., Original Letters Illustrative of English History, 3rd Series, vol.1, Richard Bentley, London (1846), pp. 232-238. The Gresham family motto is Fiat voluntas tua ('Thy will be done'). Gresham died at Bethnal Green on 21 February 1549. Family Richard Gresham married firstly, Audrey Lynne (d. 28 December 1522), the daughter of William Lynne, of Southwick, Northamptonshire, by whom he had two sons and two daughters: *John Gresham (d.1560), who married Frances Thwaytes, the daughter and coheir of Sir Henry Thwaytes of Lund, Yorkshire, by whom he had an only daughter and heir, Elizabeth Gresham (d. 6 November 1573), who married Sir Henry Neville of Billingbear House, Berkshire.; . *Sir Thomas Gresham, founder of the Royal Exchange. *Christian Gresham, who married Sir John Thynne, steward of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, builder of Longleat. Gresham is thus an ancestor of Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath. *Elizabeth Gresham. Richard Gresham married secondly Thomasyn, widow of Richard Thurston and daughter of John Worsopp.National Archives C 1/516/35 and PROB 11/21/8 His third wife was Isabel, the widow of John Pyke, goldsmith, who survived him, dying in April 1565.

The Gouden Bocht (Golden Bend) in particular is known for its large and beautiful canal houses. History The Herengracht was built starting in 1612 on the initiative of Mayor Frans Hendricksz. Oetgens, city carpenter Hendrick Jacobsz. Staets and city surveyor Lucas Jansz Sinck. Before that it was a moat (dug in 1585) for the companies located behind the Singel. The canal ran within the city wall parallel to the canal outside the city wall. The Herengracht therefore still has a kink at Driekoningenstraat, where the outer moat was routed around a stronghold at that height. When the ditch was widened into the present canal it was given the name Herengracht in 1612, after the Heren Regeerders van de stad Amsterdam (Gentlemen Governors of the city of Amsterdam). The part between Leidsegracht and the Binnen Amstel is part of the expansion after 1658. This part contains the Gouden Bocht (Golden Bend), the most prestigious part of the Herengracht. Many of the houses were inhabited here by regents, mayors and traders who earned their fortunes in trade with South America or the Dutch East Indies. Many buildings were built by the Amsterdam architects Philips Vingboons (1607–78) or Adriaan Dortsman (1635–82). In the last expansion, the section east of the Amstel was laid to the water of the IJ. This last part, located in the prosperous part of Amsterdam's Jewish quarter, was named Nieuwe Herengracht. Monuments  There are many monumental canal houses on Herengracht, such as: * 59: De Hond, (The Dog), from 1659. * 120: De Coningh van Denemarken (The King of Denmark), from 1615. * 170-172: Bartolotti House, or \\"Het Bonte Huis\\", from around 1617. * 203: Koopmanshuis, from ± 1618. * 274: D 'Witte Leli, from 1739. * 284: Van Brienen House, from 1728. * 361: Sonnenberg, from ± 1655. * 364-370: Cromhouthuizen, from 1660 to 1662 * 394: Vier Heemskinderen, from ± 1671. Named for the legend of The Four Sons of Aymon. * 432: The former home of pastor Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis. * 446: Huis van de Graeff, former city palace of Andries de Graeff * 450: Huis van Deutz, from 1663, house of Andries Adolf Deutz van Assendelft after 1722. * 462: Sweedenrijk (Sweden), from 1672. * 476: Huis De Vicq, from 1670. * 475: Huis De Neufville (Huis aan de Bocht), from 1731 and 1733. * 478: House of John Sillem (1837-1896), Dutch banker * 502: Huis met de Kolommen (House with the Columns), from 1672; official residence of the mayor. * 528-530: Two houses under one roof from 1686, commissioned by the brothers Louis of Lodewijk Trip (1605-1684) and Hendrick Trip (1607-1666), the same clients of the Trippenhuis on Kloveniersburgwal 29 in Amsterdam. Vestibule 528 rebuilt by architect Eduard Cuypers in 1895. * 572: Heren aan de Gracht, with 18th- century period rooms. * 573 : former residence of Cornelis de Graeff.

The project is currently composed of frontman, singer, and songwriter Tobacco whose vocals are altered via a vocoder, synth players The Seven Fields of Aphelion and Pony Diver, drummer Iffernaut, and bassist STV SLV. Former members include keyboardist Father Hummingbird, who typically played with a polysynth, and Power Pill Fist on bass. Style Black Moth Super Rainbow's music contains elements of psychedelia, folk, electronica, pop, and rock. Their distinctive sound is characterized by analog electronic instruments including the vocoder, Rhodes piano and Novatron.Pareles, Jon (27 July 2008) Pop (The Week Ahead), The New York Times (describing the band as one that \\"mingle psychedelic whimsy ... with the pulsating analog synthesizers that made their way into rock in the early 70s\\") A Graveface insert included inside the album Dandelion Gum describes them as such: \\"Deep in the woods of western Pennsylvania vocoders hum amongst the flowers and synths bubble under the leaf-strewn ground while flutes whistle in the wind and beats bounce to the soft drizzle of a warm acid rain. As the sun peeks out from between the clouds, the organic aural concoction of Black Moth Super Rainbow starts to glisten above the trees.\\" History When prompted on the origin of BMSR, frontman Tobacco stated the following: > I had started off really noisy and abstract with Allegheny White Fish. We > were all so happy with ourselves for coming up with that name in 10th grade, > but it wasn’t too funny 4 years later. Then ssc [satanstompingcaterpillars] > was like my way to be more melodic all the time, and a little more serious. > Then when it started to shift again into something I might be a little more > comfortable performing live, I brought in the rest of the band and we > changed over again. I’ve always felt like these ideas shouldn’t outstay > their welcome. 3 or 4 records is enough, because I get really bored, and I > like to keep these bands and ideas as pure as I can, in their places in > time, until it seems like I’ve finally gotten it right. From 1996 to 2000, musician Tobacco, along with other musicians, worked on and recorded songs for the Allegheny White Fish Tapes. When former member Power Pill Fist joined, a side project called satanstompingcaterpillars was born and became active from 2000 to 2002. Under the project, the members self-released their music on different labels, including Fuckeroo and Side 8. After their third album, The Most Wonderfulest Thing in 2002, the newly banded together musicians added three members, Father Hummingbird, The Seven Fields of Aphelion and Iffernaut. They changed their name to form Black Moth Super Rainbow (BMSR) in 2003. Tobacco and BMSR are both active today. BMSR began releasing their music on The 70's Gymnastics Recording Company, which is the band's own imprint. It is characterized by a tree-person jumping rope in a dress. Black Moth Super Rainbow's first album Falling Through a Field serves as a best-of collection for satanstompingcaterpillars. After 2005, Graveface picked them up with Lost, Picking Flowers in the Woods and bonus reissued versions of their first two albums. The group's third album Dandelion Gum was released in 2007. The LP is their most commercially and critically successful release. With it came their first music video for the track \\"Sun Lips.\\" On November 4, 2008, BMSR released Drippers. The EP not only includes new tracks like \\"Happy Melted City\\" and \\"Milk Skates\\" but also features some lost tracks from the Dandelion Gum era such as \\"We Are the Pagans\\" and \\"One Day I Had an Extra Toe.\\" The release also features Mike Watt and BMSR's first official remix of Laura Burhenn's song \\"Just for the Night.\\" Along with Drippers, the band released Bonus Drippers for MP3 download on their Myspace, which includes older tracks, unreleased tracks and bonus tracks like \\"The Dark Forest Joggers,\\" a Dandelion Gum vinyl exclusive, \\"Side 9,\\" a Lost, Picking Flowers in the Woods vinyl bonus track, or \\"Melting in the Meadow,\\" a Start a People outtake track. Their fourth album Eating Us was released on May 26, 2009. Around the end of the year, Rad Cult re-published The Autumn Kaleidoscope Got Changed by satanstompingcaterpillars. On January 12, 2012, Tobacco posted via his Facebook account that a BMSR album entitled Psychic Love Damage had been recorded, but scrapped soon after completion. According to Tobacco, \\"it was supposed to come out this year, but it wasn't very exciting. and not good enough in my opinion for you to spend your $ on. so i junked it for its best moments and made an album that i'm really in love with.\\" He went on to state that although scrapped, a new BMSR album was slated for release in the near future, possibly in the summer. He also stated he would be releasing many of his favorite scrapped pieces through his soundcloud account. On April 5, 2012, Tobacco posted news on the BMSR website confirming the next album's release date. The announcement arrived alongside the release of a single titled \\"Spraypaint\\" to promote the untitled new album. On July 10, 2012, Tobacco created a Kickstarter campaign to fund the release of their newly announced album Cobra Juicy. Different donation ranges contain different prizes, beginning with $1 for a digital download of the upcoming single \\"Windshield Smasher\\" to $10,000 for a rollerskating party in Pennsylvania to be DJ'd by Tobacco. Most prizes contain CDs, LPS, or digital downloads of the new album. The abandoned Psychic Love Damage EP served as a bonus prize. On May 4, 2018, the project's 6th album Panic Blooms was released and their first album to chart on Billboard's Top 100 sales, as well as #1 on the Heatseeker chart. Live performance BMSR has appeared at the WIDR Barking Tuna, Sasquatch! Music Festival, South by Southwest and several other festivals. On March 17, 2007, they played alongside The Octopus Project as one band at the South by Southwest music festival, playing music from their collaborative project, The House of Apples and Eyeballs. BMSR opened for The Flaming Lips on their Fall 2007 tour. The band performed at the 2008 SXSW music festival in a badges and wristbands only, packed-to-capacity show at The Thirsty Nickel. The band's 2009 tour featured a video introduction created by Eric Wareheim. Mike Watt also occasionally joined the band on stage to play bass during this tour. The band supported Nine Inch Nails on their 2018 European Tour, with member TOBACCO opening for NIN on their US shows. Solo projects Several members of BMSR have embarked on solo work and side-projects outside of the band. Frontman Tobacco released his debut studio album, Fucked Up Friends, in 2008; the album featured a darker, harsher tone that took influence from instrumental hip hop. The following year, he released The Allegheny White Fish Tapes, a collection of mixtapes and limited CDs that predate BMSR. In 2010, Tobacco released his second solo album Maniac Meat; the LP features vocals from Beck on two tracks, \\"Fresh Hex\\" and \\"Grape Aerosmith.\\" In the same year, The Seven Fields of Aphelion released her debut solo album Periphery. TOBACCO's project was followed by two more releases: Ultima II Massage in 2014 and Sweatbox Dynasty in 2016.

Abi Gamin is the second highest peak in the immediate region, after Kamet. It is also one of the fifteen seven thousand metre peaks of Uttarakhand, and as such it is a significant peak. However it is not particularly independent, lying as it does close to the higher peak of Kamet, and separated from it by the high saddle known as Meade's Col, . Abi Gamin was surveyed (along with the rest of the group) by Richard Strachey in 1848; this was the first time that the great heights of these peaks was recognized. In 1855, the Schlagintweit brothers named this range as Western, Central and Eastern Abi Gamin. These correspond to Mukut Parbat, Kamet and Abi Gamin.  Climbing history  The first attempt to climb Kamet was launched by Adolf and Robert Schlagintweit from the Tibetan side up the NE ridge: they estimated that in August 1855 they reached an altitude of 22,239 or on Kamet, though they were in fact attempting to climb Abi Gamin.Himalayan Journal Vol.36, p.72Joydeep Sircar,Himalayan handbook, Calcutta 1979Frank Smythe, Kamet Conquered: The historic first ascent of a Himalayan giant, p. 15Moritz von Brescius, Friederike Kaiser, Stephanie Kleidt Böhlau, Über den Himalaya: Die Expedition der Brüder Schlagintweit nach Indien und Zentralasien 1854 bis 1858, Verlag Köln Weimar, 2015, p. 281 Their attempt resulted in an at the time widely acknowledged altitude record. During the 1874-77 survey by the Survey of India under E. C. Ryall, I. S. Pocock set up a plane table at c.22050' on the West flank of Abi Gamin.Alpine Journal Vol. 33, p.72 Between 1907 and 1913 a number of expeditions attempting Kamet reached high altitudes on the flanks of this mountain. Tom George Longstaff in 1907 recced the Purbi(East) Kamet approaches, and C.F.Meade's team followed the same route in 1913 to reach Meade's Col up the East flank of the massif. The attempts by A.M.Slingsby in 1911 and 1913 and C.F.Meade in 1912 were up the West flank from the Pachhmi(West) Kamet glacier. These reached Slingsby's Col(c.21000') between Mukut Parbat and Abi Gamin, but failed to go beyond c.23000'. Abi Gamin was climbed for the first time in 1950 by a small Anglo- Swiss Expedition comprising Alfred Tissierès, R. Dittert, and G. Chevalley (all Swiss), and Englishman Kenneth Berrill. They approached from the north side through Tibet, reached over the Mana Pass. Their NE ridge route was the same route the Schlagintweit's had tried nearly a century earlier! The summit was reached by the three Swiss members: they may have been accompanied by Sherpa Dawa Thondup.Himalayan Journal 17, p.80Toni Hiebeler,Himalaja und Karakorum Indian expeditions under Nandu Jayal climbed the peak in 1953 and 1955 by the SW ridge from Meade's Col, reached up the East flank of the massif from the Purbi Kamet glacier. Later ascents have been up this route.

The aim of connection-oriented Ethernet is to create a networking technology that combines the flexibility and cost-efficiency of Ethernet with the reliability of connection-oriented protocols. Connection-oriented Ethernet is used in commercial carrier grade networks. Traditional carrier networks deliver services at very high availability. Packet-switched networks are different, as they offer services based on statistical multiplexing. Moreover, packet transport equipment, which makes up the machinery of data networking, leaves most of the carrier-grade qualities such as quality of service, routing, provisioning, and security, to be realized by packet processing. Addressing these needs in a cost-efficient way is a challenge for packet-based technologies. The IP-MPLS approach aims at providing guaranteed services over the Internet Protocol using a multitude of networking protocols to create, maintain and handle packet data streams. While this approach solves the problem, it inevitably also creates a great deal of complexity. This has resulted in the emergence of connection-oriented Ethernet which includes a variety of methodologies to utilize Ethernet for the same functionalities otherwise based on extensive IP protocols. The challenge of carrier Ethernet is to add carrier-grade functionality to Ethernet equipment without losing the cost-effectiveness and simplicity that makes it attractive in the first place. To meet this challenge, common connection-oriented Ethernet solutions have chosen to rid themselves of the complex parts of packet transport to achieve stability and control. Key connection-oriented Ethernet technologies used to achieve this include mainly IEEE 802.1ah, Provider Backbone Transport and MPLS-TP, and formerly T-MPLS.  PBT and PBB  Provider Backbone Transport (PBT) is connection-oriented switch operation scheme and network management architecture. PBT was invented by British Telecom (BT) and developed by Nortel (now Avaya). It defines methods to emulate connection-oriented networks by providing \\"nailed-up\\" trunks through a packet-switched network. Key data-plane differences from PBB include the static configuration of forwarding tables within Ethernet switches, dropping of multicast packets and the prevention of \\"flooding\\" of frames to unknown destination addresses. Configuration is performed by a centralized management server like in SDH networks, though in the future a control plane may be added. PBT has been presented to IEEE802 and a new project has been approved to standardize it under the name of Provider Backbone Bridge Traffic Engineering (PBB-TE) (IEEE 802.1Qay), a modification to PBB. Provider Backbone Bridges (PBB) is an Ethernet data-plane technology invented in 2004 by Nortel Networks (now Avaya). It is sometimes known as MAC- in-MAC because it involves encapsulating an Ethernet datagram inside another one with new source and destination addresses (termed B-SA and B-DA). IEEE802 is standardizing the technology as (IEEE 802.1ah), currently under development. PBB is the original data-plane chosen by British Telecom for their new PBT-based Ethernet transport. PBB can support point-to-point, point- to-multipoint and multipoint-to-multipoint networks. PBT focuses on point-to- point connectivity, and may be capable of extension to point-to-multipoint, a key technology for advanced data applications such as IPTV. PBT avoids trying to address multipoint-to-multipoint networking, as in the opinion of some of its supporters guaranteed levels of service in multipoint-to-multipoint networks are impossible. Additionally Ethernet is being reinforced with operations, administration, and maintenance (OAM) capabilities through the work of various standard bodies (IEEE 802.1ag, ITU-T Y.1731 and G.8021, IEEE 802.3ah). PBT/PBB equipment leverages economies of scale inherent in Ethernet, promising about 30%-40% cheaper solutions compared to T-MPLS equipment with identical features and capabilities,The T-MPLS vs. PBT debate making PBT a better overall return on investment.Traffic engineering for Ethernet: PBT vs. T-MPLS  T-MPLS (Transport MPLS) / MPLS-TP (MPLS Transport Profile)  T-MPLS, as its name implies, is a derivative of MPLS that renounces all MPLS signaling features and, like PBT, uses a centralized control-plane to perform routing and traffic engineering. T-MPLS is currently being standardized only at ITU-T and enjoys strong vendor support but little carrier support. As a native MPLS derivative, T-MPLS can be easily implemented over existing MPLS routers. However, T-MPLS has been stripped of the characteristics which originally made it attractive to carriers—control-plane automation, signaling, and QoS—and therefore has yet to prove its benefits for the transport network. T-MPLS OAM, defined in ITU Y.1711, is different from MPLS OAM and lacks powerful management tools that carriers typically expect. T MPLS was abandoned by the ITU-T in favor of MPLS-TP in December 2008.\\\\- ITU-T newslog, 10 March 2009 MPLS-TP or MPLS Transport Profile is a profile of MPLS developed in cooperation between ITU-T and IETF since 2008 as a connection-oriented packet- switched (CO-PS) extension. Based on the same architectural principles of layered networking that are used in longstanding transport network technologies like SDH, SONET, and OTN, MPLS-TP provides a reliable packet- based L2 technology that is comparable to circuit-based transport networking, and thus aligned with current organizational processes and large-scale work procedures similar to other packet transport technologies.  Achieving the promise of carrier-grade Ethernet  Services in the data network are typically classified into 2 major categories: Committed Information Rate (CIR) and Excess Information Rate (EIR). A CIR service guarantees its user a fixed amount of bandwidth, whereas an EIR service offers best-effort only transport. Both types of services share a single capacity-constrained infrastructure. Both are further defined by additional parameters. A carrier's return on investment is directly related to its ability to transport more service instances over a fixed capacity-constrained infrastructure, keeping Quality of Service high. It is further associated with its ability to offer a broad range of added-value services, such as IPTV, Voice, and VPN, whose requirements can widely vary and pose technical difficulties when sharing the same infrastructure. With the above in mind, the carrier's objective is to offer a maximum amount of best-effort EIR services over its network while reliably serving its committed CIR services. To achieve this PBB/PBT and T-MPLS approaches largely under-provision network resources, in order to avoid a situation where a burst in best-effort traffic would jeopardize the ability to serve committed traffic, leading to costly penalties. An additional issue with best-effort access on data networks is fair allocation among clients. With PBB/PBT and T-MPLS, the amount of bandwidth available to a particular client greatly depends on the client's location and the prevailing traffic conditions. This limits the value customers attach to EIR services and undercuts carriers' opportunities to offer differentiated access to its excess capacity. Performing traffic engineering in real-time is thus key to next- generation Ethernet transport. Additional qualities are required to make Ethernet a carrier-grade technology: * Rich OAM: capacity optimization, path calculation and configuration, iterative optimization. * Path protection: sub-50ms failover. * Support for next-generation services: efficient provisioning of point-to-multipoint and multipoint-to-multipoint services. Multi-vendor support, the ability to support a variety of Ethernet switches in the core, is a desirable attribute as it allows carriers to use inexpensive switches to build their metro transport network. Vendors such as Tejas Networks, Ethos Networks, and Nortel offer solutions which meet the above requirements, yet preserve Ethernet's simplicity and flexibility.

Invasive and interventional cardiology is currently closely associated with cardiologists (physicians who treat the diseases of the heart), though the development and most of its early research and procedures were performed by diagnostic and interventional radiologists. The birth of invasive cardiology The history of invasive cardiology begins with the development of cardiac catheterization in 1711, when Stephen Hales placed catheters into the right and left ventricles of a living horse. Variations on the technique were performed over the subsequent century, with formal study of cardiac physiology being performed by Claude Bernard in the 1840s. Catheterization of humans The technique of angiography itself was first developed in 1927 by the Portuguese physician Egas Moniz at the University of Lisbon for cerebral angiography, the viewing of brain vasculature by X-ray radiation with the aid of a contrast medium introduced by catheter. Cardiac catheterization was first performed when Werner Forssmann, in 1929, created an incision in one of his left antecubital veins and inserted a catheter into his venous system. He then guided the catheter by fluoroscopy into his right atrium. Subsequently, he walked up a flight of stairs to the radiology department and documented the procedure by having a chest roentgenogram performed. Over the next year, catheters were placed in a similar manner into the right ventricle, and measurements of pressure and cardiac output (using the Fick principle) were performed. In the early 1940s, André Cournand, in collaboration with Dickinson Richards, performed more systematic measurements of the hemodynamics of the heart. For their work in the discovery of cardiac catheterization and hemodynamic measurements, Cournand, Forssmann, and Richards shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1956. =Development of the diagnostic coronary angiogram= In 1958, Interventional Radiologist, Dr. Charles Dotter began working on methods to visualize the coronary anatomy via sequential radiographic films. He invented a method known as occlusive aortography in an animal model. Occlusive aortography involved the transient occlusion of the aorta and subsequent injection of a small amount of radiographic contrast agent into the aortic root and subsequent serial x-rays to visualize the coronary arteries. This method produced impressive images of the coronary anatomy. Dotter later reported that all the animals used in the procedure survived. Later that same year, while performing an aortic root aortography, Mason Sones, a pediatric cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, noted that the catheter had accidentally entered the patient's right coronary artery. Before the catheter could be removed, 30cc of contrast agent had been injected. While the patient went into ventricular fibrillation, the dangerous arrhythmia was terminated by Dr. Sones promptly performing a precordial thump which restored sinus rhythm. This became the world's first selective coronary arteriogram. Until that time, it was believed that even a small amount of contrast agent within a coronary artery would be fatal. Until the 1950s, placing a catheter into either the arterial or venous system involved a \\"cut down\\" procedure, in which the soft tissues were dissected out of the way until the artery or vein was directly visualized and subsequently punctured by a catheter; this was known as the Sones technique. The percutaneous approach that is widely used today was developed by radiologist Sven-Ivar Seldinger in 1953. This method was used initially for the visualization of the peripheral arteries. Percutaneous access of the artery or vein is still commonly known as the Seldinger technique. The use of the Seldinger technique for visualizing the coronary arteries was described by Ricketts and Abrams in 1962 and Judkins in 1967. By the late 1960s, Melvin Judkins had begun work on creating catheters that were specially shaped to reach the coronary arteries to perform selective coronary angiography. His initial work involved shaping stiff wires and comparing those shapes to radiographs of the ascending aorta to determine if the shape appeared promising. Then he would place the stiff wire inside a flexible catheter and use a heat-fixation method to permanently shape the catheter. In the first use of these catheters in humans, each catheter was specifically shaped to match the size and shape of the aorta of the subject. His work was documented in 1967, and by 1968 the Judkins catheters were manufactured in a limited number of fixed tip shapes. Catheters in these shapes carry his name and are still used to this day for selective coronary angiography. =Dawn of the interventional era= The use of tapered Teflon dilating catheters for the treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease was first described in 1964 by two interventional radiologists, Charles Dotter and Melvin Judkins, when they used it to treat a case of atherosclerotic disease in the superficial femoral artery of the left leg. Building on their work and his own research involving balloon-tipped catheters, Andreas Gruentzig performed the first success percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (known as PTCA or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)) on a human on September 16, 1977 at University Hospital, Zurich. The results of the procedure were presented at the American Heart Association meeting two months later to a stunned audience of cardiologists. In the subsequent three years, Dr. Gruentzig performed coronary angioplasties in 169 patients in Zurich, while teaching the practice of coronary angioplasty to a field of budding interventional cardiologists. Ten years later, nearly 90 percent of these individuals were still alive. By the mid-1980s, over 300,000 PTCAs were being performed on a yearly basis, equalling the number of bypass surgeries being performed for coronary artery disease. Soon after Andreas Gruentzig began performing percutaneous interventions on individuals with stable coronary artery disease, multiple groups described the use of catheter-delivered streptokinase for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). In the early years of coronary angioplasty, there were a number of serious complications. Abrupt vessel closure after balloon angioplasty occurred in approximately 1% of cases, often necessitating emergency bypass surgery. Vessel dissection was a frequent issue as a result of improper sizing of the balloon relative to the arterial diameter. Late restenosis occurred in as many as 30% of individuals who underwent PTCA, often causing recurrence of symptoms necessitating repeat procedures. =Development of the intracoronary stent= From the time of the initial percutaneous balloon angioplasty, it was theorized that devices could be placed inside the arteries as scaffolds to keep them open after a successful balloon angioplasty. This did not become a reality in the cardiac realm until the first intracoronary stents were successfully deployed in coronary arteries in 1986. The first stents used were self-expanding Wallstents. The use of intracoronary stents was quickly identified as a method to treat some complications due to PTCA, and their use can decrease the incidence of emergency bypass surgery for acute complications post balloon angioplasty. It was quickly realized that restenosis rates were significantly lower in individuals who received an intracoronary stent when compared to those who underwent just balloon angioplasty. A damper on the immediate use of intracoronary stents was subacute thrombosis. Subacute thrombosis rates with intracoronary stents proved to be about 3.7 percent, higher than the rates seen after balloon angioplasty. Post-procedure bleeding was also an issue, due to the intense combination of anticoagulation and anti- platelet agents used to prevent stent thrombosis. Stent technology improved rapidly, and in 1989 the Palmaz-Schatz balloon-expandable intracoronary stent was developed. Initial results with the Palmaz-Schatz stents were excellent when compared to balloon angioplasty, with a significantly lower incidence of abrupt closure and peri-procedure heart attack. Late restenosis rates with Palmaz-Schatz stents were also significantly improved when compared with balloon angioplasty. However, mortality rates were unchanged compared to balloon angioplasty. While the rates of subacute thrombosis and bleeding complications associated with stent placement were high, by 1999 nearly 85% of all PCI procedures included intracoronary stenting. In recognition of the focused training required by cardiologists to perform percutaneous coronary interventions and the rapid progression in the field of percutaneous coronary interventions, specialized fellowship training in the field of Interventional Cardiology was instituted in 1999. =Changes in post-procedure medications= Through the 1990s and beyond, various incremental improvements were made in balloon and stent technology, as well as newer devices, some of which are still in use today while many more have fallen into disuse. As important as balloon and stent technology had been, it was becoming obvious that the anticoagulation and anti-platelet regimen that individuals received post- intervention was at least as important. Trials in the late 1990s revealed that anticoagulation with warfarin was not required post balloon angioplasty or stent implantation, while intense anti-platelet regimens and changes in procedural technique (most importantly, making sure that the stent was well opposed to the walls of the coronary artery) improved short term and long term outcomes. Many different antiplatelet regimens were evaluated in the 1990s and the turn of the 21st century, with the optimal regimen in an individual patient still being up for debate. =The drug eluting stent era= With the high use of intracoronary stents during PCI procedures, the focus of treatment changed from procedural success to prevention of recurrence of disease in the treated area (in-stent restenosis). By the late 1990s it was generally acknowledged among cardiologists that the incidence of in-stent restenosis was between 15 and 30%, and possibly higher in certain subgroups of individuals. Stent manufacturers experimented with (and continue to experiment with) a number of chemical agents to prevent the neointimal hyperplasia that is the cause of in-stent restenosis. One of the first products of the new focus on preventing late events (such as in stent restenosis and late thrombosis) was the heparin-coated Palmaz-Schatz stent. These coated stents were found to have a lower incidence of subacute thrombosis than bare metal stents. At approximately the same time, Cordis (a division of Johnson & Johnson) was developing the Cypher stent, a stent that would release sirolimus (a chemotherapeutic agent) over time. The first study of these individuals revealed an incredible lack of restenosis (zero percent restenosis) at six months. This led to the approval for the stent to be used in Europe in April 2002. Further trials with the Cypher stent revealed that restenosis did occur in some individuals with high risk features (such as long areas of stenosis or a history of diabetes mellitus), but that the restenosis rate was significantly lower than with bare metal stents (3.2 percent compared to 35.4 percent). About a year after approval in Europe, the United States FDA approved the use of the Cypher stent as the first drug-eluting stent for use in the general population in the United States. With the significantly lower restenosis rates of drug eluting stents compared to bare metal stents, the interventional cardiology community began using these stents as soon as they became available. Cordis, the manufacturer of the Cypher drug eluting stent, was not able to keep up with the demand for these stents when they first entered the market. This fueled a rationing of Cypher stents; they were used on difficult anatomy and high risk individuals. At the time there was a fear by the general population that these drug eluting stents would not be used on individuals who could not afford them (as they cost significantly more than the bare metal stents of the era). Concurrent with the development of the Cypher stent, Boston Scientific started development of the Taxus stent. The Taxus stent was the Express2 metal stent, which was in general use for a number of years, with a copolymer coating of paclitaxel that inhibited cell replication. As with the Cypher stent before it, the first trials of the Taxus stent revealed no evidence of in-stent restenosis at six months after the procedure, while later studies showed some restenosis, at a rate much lower than the bare metal counterpart. Based on these trials, the Taxus stent was approved for use in Europe in 2003. With further study, the FDA approved the use of the Taxus stent in the United States in March 2004. By the end of 2004, drug-eluting stents were used in nearly 80 percent of all percutaneous coronary interventions. Trials of heparin-coated stents could not match the significant decrease in restenosis rates seen with the Cypher and Taxus stents. With the increased supply in the chemotherapeutic drug-eluting stents available, the use of heparin-coated stents waned. =Modern controversies in interventional cardiology= The field of interventional cardiology has had a number of controversies since its inception. In part this is because of the dawning of the randomized control trial as the marker of a successful procedure. This is worsened by the rapid changes in the field of interventional cardiology. Procedures would be used soon after they are described in the literature or at conferences, with trial data determining if the procedure improves outcomes lagging behind by years due to the strict protocols and long follow-up of patients necessary to test the procedure. By the time the trials were published, they would be considered out of date, as they did not reflect the current practice in the field. This led to the inception and use of a number of procedures and devices in the interventional realm that have fallen out of practice due to their being found to not improve outcomes after formal trials have been performed. Roles of bypass surgery and intracoronary stents for coronary artery disease Another source of controversy in the field of interventional cardiology is the overlapping roles of PCI and coronary artery bypass surgery for individuals with coronary artery disease. This area has been studied in a number of trials since the early 1990s. Unfortunately, due to the rapid changes in technique in both bypass surgery as well as PCI, added to the better understanding of the role of intense pharmacologic therapy in individuals with coronary artery disease, questions still remain on the best form of therapy in many subgroups of patients. Multiple ongoing studies hope to tease out which individuals do better with PCI and which do better with CABG, but in general each case is individualized to the patient and the relative comfort level of the interventional cardiologist and the cardiothoracic surgeon. The role of PCI in individuals without symptoms of ischemic heart disease In the vast majority of cases, percutaneous coronary interventions do not improve mortality when compared to optimal medical therapy in the stable individual. This is, of course, not true in the unstable individual, such as in the setting after a myocardial infarction (heart attack). Even in the stable individuals, however, there are a number of subsets in which there is a mortality benefit that is attributed to PCI. Subsequently, at the 2007 meeting of the American College of Cardiology (ACC), data from the COURAGE trial was presented, suggested that the combination of PCI and intensive (optimal) medical therapy did not reduce the incidence of death, heart attacks, or stroke compared to intensive medical therapy alone. Critics of the trial state that the trial did not take into account the improvement in symptoms attributed to PCI. Also, the data that was presented was an intention to treat analysis, and that there was a (possibly) significant crossover from the medical therapy arm to the PCI arm of the study. It should also be noted that the optimal medical therapy seen in the COURAGE trial is significantly more aggressive than the current guidelines of the ACC and are not commonly seen in the general cardiology clinic. As with any large clinical trial, the therapies available had changed from when the trial was designed to when the results were presented. In particular, drug eluting stents, while commonly used in practice at the time the results of the trial were presented, were used in less than 5 percent of individuals in the trial. The safety of drug- eluting stents When the results of the first trials of drug-eluting stents were published, there was a general feeling in the interventional cardiology community that these devices would be part of the perfect revascularization regimen for coronary artery disease. With the very low restenosis rates of the RAVEL and SIRIUS trials, interventions were performed on more complex blockages in the coronary arteries, under the assumption that the results in real life would mimic the results in the trials. The antiplatelet regimens that were advised for the drug eluting stents were based on the early trials of these stents. Based on these trials, the antiplatelet regimen was a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel for 3 months when Cypher stents were used, and 9 months when Taxus stents were used, followed by aspirin indefinitely. Soon, case reports started being published regarding late stent thrombosis. At the 2006 annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, preliminary results of the BASKET-LATE trial were presented, which showed a slight increase in late thrombosis associated with drug eluting stents over bare metal stents. However, this increase was not statistically significant, and further data would have to be collected. Further data published over the following year had conflicting results, and it was unclear whether stent thrombosis was truly higher when compared to bare metal stents. During this time of uncertainty, many cardiologists started extending the dual antiplatelet regimen of aspirin and clopidogrel in these individuals, as some data suggested that it may prevent late thrombosis. The FDA held an expert panel in December 2006 to go over the data presented by Cordis and Boston Scientific to determine if drug eluting stents should be considered less safe than bare metal stents. It became evident at the meeting that with all the data published there were varied definitions of late thrombosis and key differences in the types of lesions in different studies, hampering analysis of the data. It was also noted that with the advent of drug eluting stents, interventional cardiologists began performing procedures on more complex lesions, subsequently using the drug eluting stents in \\"off label\\" coronary artery lesions, which would otherwise go untreated or for bypass surgery. The FDA advisory board reiterated the ACC guidelines that clopidogrel should be continued for 12 months after drug eluting stent placement in individuals who are at low risk for bleeding.

He issued a fatwa of armed fighting in favor of jihad against the British empire in 1857. Life Fazl-e-Haq was born into a family of Indian Muslims. He was born on 7 April 1796 in Khairabad, Sitapur. His father was sadr-ul-sadur, the chief advisor to the Mughals regarding religious matters. He became a teacher by the age of 13. In 1828, he was appointed to the position of mufti in the Department of Qaza. Shortly after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 failed, he was covered by an amnesty and was arrested by the British authorities on 30 January 1859 at Khairabad for inciting violence.Anderson, C (2007) The Indian Uprising of 1857–8: prisons, prisoners, and 'Jihad', Anthem Press, London P17 He was tried and found guilty of encouraging murder and role in the 'jihad'. He had chosen to be his own counsel and defended himself. His arguments and the way he defended his case was so convincing that the presiding magistrate was writing a judgement to exonerate him, when he confessed to giving the fatwa, declaring that he could not lie. He was sentenced for life to the prison at Kalapani (Cellular Jail) on Andaman Island , and his property was confiscated by the judicial commissioner of Awadh court. He reached Andaman Island on 8 October 1859 aboard the steam frigate \\"Fire Queen\\". He would remain imprisoned there until his death in 1861. Besides being a scholar of Islamic studies and theology, he was also a literary persona, especially of Urdu, Arabic and Persian literature. More than 4,00 couplets in Arabic are attributed to him. He edited the first diwan of Mirza Ghalib on his request. He had a phenomenal memory and memorized the Qur'an in a little over four months. He has also completed the curriculum in Arabic, Persian and religious studies by the age of thirteen. On account of his deep knowledge and erudition he was called \\"Allama\\" and later was venerated as a great sufi. He was also bestowed with the title imam hikmat and kalaam (The imam of logic, philosophy and literature). He was considered the final authority on issuing fatwas or religious rulings. He possessed a great presence of mind and was very witty. There are many stories about his repartee with Mirza Ghalib and other contemporary eminent poets, writers and intellectuals. He and his son Abdul al-Haq Khairabadi established Madrasa Khairabad in northern India, where many scholars got educated. He wrote Risala-e-Sauratul Hindia in Arabic language, and wrote an account of the rebellion called As-Saurat al Hindiya. =Fatawas against Deobandi theories = Khairabadi issued fatwas against the Wahabi- Deobandi doctrine of God's alleged ability to lie (Imkan-e-Kizb). Darul Uloom Deoband, founder Rashid Ahmad Gangohi stated that God has the ability to lie. This doctrine is called Imkan-i Kizb. According to this doctrine, because God is omnipotent, God is capable of lying. Gangohi supported the doctrine that God has the ability to make additional prophets after Muhammad (Imkan-i Nazir) and other prophets equal to Muhammad. Allama Fazle Haq Khairabadi refuted these theories and wrote that according to the Qur’an and Hadith, the prophet Muhammad is the final prophet, and there can be no other prophet or \\"messenger\\" after him. To believe that there can be another Muhammad would necessitate that Allah did something apart from what he has stated in the Qur’an, that is, that Allah has lied. Lying is a flaw and it is impossible for Allah to have a flaw. This reflects his deep insight to the political, social and religious environment which was emerging with the growing influence of Englishmen and at last capture of Delhi by them. =Fatwa of Jihad= In 1857, Khairabadi signed a Fatwa of Jihad against British government which led to his arrest, and then he was sent into exile to Kalapani. Personal life He was Farooqui. One of his sons, Abdul Haque, was also a leading and respected scholar and was given the title of Shamsul Ulema. His grandson is Muztar Khairabadi. Jan Nisar Akhtar is his great-grandson. Among his sons Abdul Haq Khairabadi was a rational scholar, a teacher of Majid Ali Jaunpuri. Death Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi died on 19 August 1861 in exile on the Andaman Islands.

They aim to increase reliability and security of connectivity for users who connect the devices to the Internet or to computers running Microsoft Windows. These technologies provide control of network Quality of Service (QoS) and diagnostics for data sharing, communications, and entertainment. Windows Rally technologies provide provisioning for the following devices: * Wireless access points, PCs, and servers * Network printers, projectors, printer bridges, digital still cameras, and game consoles * Digital media receivers, network media players, set-top boxes, digital photo frames, and PDAs Windows Rally technologies Architecture of the Windows Rally stack Windows Rally includes the following set of technologies: =LLTD= The Link Layer Topology Discovery (LLTD) protocol enables applications to discover devices and determine network topology. In Windows Vista, it enables a graphical view of all the devices in the network on the Network Map. For Windows XP computers to appear on the Network Map, the LLTD Responder must be downloaded and installed. Devices that provide audio or video playback or that are bandwidth sensitive can implement the QoS Extension part of the protocol so that they receive prioritized streams and that changes in available bandwidth have less impact on the playback experience. =qWAVE= Windows Vista includes qWAVE, a pre-configured Quality of Service API for time dependent multimedia data, such as audio or video streams. qWAVE uses different packet priority schemes for real-time flows (such as multimedia packets) and best-effort flows (such as file downloads or e-mails) to ensure that real time data gets delayed as little as possible, while providing a high quality channel for other data packets. qWAVE-enabled applications together with devices that implement the LLTD QoS Extensions aim to improve an end user's experience of streaming video by prioritizing traffic and reducing the effects of network-related transient issues. =Windows Connect Now= Windows Connect Now (WCN) is the name of Windows Rally technologies aimed for simpler wireless device configuration. With Windows Connect Now, users running Windows Vista or Windows XP SP2 can create network configuration settings and transmit them to the access point. Alternatively, users can also print the configuration settings for reference for manually configuring the device. With Windows Connect Now, one of the following methods may be used for easier configuration: * WCN-NET is Microsoft's implementation of the Wi-Fi Simple Config standard. It provides for configuration of devices using out-of-band Ethernet and in-band wireless networks. In Windows Vista, WCN-NET can discover an unconfigured router, access point, base station or a device such as a Media Center Extender by using UPnP, authenticate with the device by using a personal identification number (PIN), provide wireless settings that are based on user selection and set up a wireless network over a wired Ethernet connection. Windows XP and earlier Windows versions do not support WCN-NET. * WCN-UFD uses an API and an XML format that works with a wizard to write configuration files to a USB Flash Drive for more secure wireless networks. Windows XP Service Pack 2 and later Windows operating systems supports WCN-UFD. * WCN-MTP includes a Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) extension that enables an MTP initiator to provide an MTP responder with configuration parameters for joining a wireless network and supports more secure configuration of MTP-capable devices on wireless networks. In Windows Vista, a temporary USB cable connection can be used for MTP-class devices such as portable media, digital cameras etc. =Devices Profile for Web Services= The Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS) standard defines a minimal set of implementation constraints to enable secure web service messaging, discovery, description, and eventing on resource- constrained devices. DPWS describes a set of requirements that enable a device to be discovered by clients and describe available services to those clients. DPWS is similar Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) but, it is fully aligned with Web Services technology, supports standards for device connectivity such as WS-Discovery and WS-Eventing and includes numerous extension points allowing for integration of device-provided services in enterprise-wide application scenarios and roaming devices that work across the Internet. In Windows Vista, Web Services for Devices (WSDAPI) is an unmanaged code implementation of the Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS) standard. The Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) executes managed code and offers enterprise-level services for Web Services solutions on Windows XP and Windows Vista. Function Discovery To support Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) and WS- Discovery, and for extensible discovery to support other protocols, Windows Vista includes the Function Discovery API. Function Discovery serves as an abstraction layer between applications and devices, allowing applications to discover devices by referencing the device's function, rather than by its bus type or the nature of its connection. The Function Discovery API aims to create applications that enumerate system resources, use devices of a specific type and discover and manage lists of devices or objects, which are sorted by functionality or class, whether local or network connected. Function Discovery supports an extensible discovery provider model. Vendors can also create a custom provider to expose resources through Function Discovery. =Plug and Play Extensions (PnP-X)= PnP-X uses SSDP and WS-Discovery network communication protocols to make network-connected devices as discoverable as those that are connected directly to a computer over a bus such as Universal Serial Bus (USB). PnP-X allows network-connected devices to appear as devices inside Windows connected physically and provides an installation experience that is similar to attaching a bus-connected device. The device manufacturer implements PnP-X capabilities to supplement either UPnP or Web Services for Devices (WSD) enabled devices. As a result, for end users, the device is relatively as easy to install as traditional Plug and Play devices. =Universal Plug and Play= Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is an IP-based protocol suite based on preliminary versions of Web Services protocols such as XML and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). With UPnP, a device can dynamically join a network, obtain an IP address, convey its capability, and discover the presence and capabilities of other devices on the network. Information about the set of services that a particular device type can provide is captured in an XML device description document that the device hosts. The device description also lists properties such as device name and icons associated with the device. UPnP has been adopted widely for devices that interact in home network audio-video scenarios. UPnP is supported by Windows Me, Windows XP and Windows Vista. In Windows Vista, UPnP is integrated with PnP-X and Function Discovery.

Paanji (IAST: Pãji; IPA: [pãːd͡ʒi])) is the Hindu astronomical almanac, published in Odia, Maithili, Assamese and Bengali. In colloquial language it is called a panji. In other parts of India it is called a panchangam. It is amongst the most popular annual books published in India and is a handy reference for observant Hindus to determine the most auspicious times for their rituals, festivals, celebrations, and pursuits of various sorts including marriage, undertaking travels, etc. It is somewhat a ready-reckoner, or the first source, before one approaches a priest or an astrologer to decide on the details. Even \\"non- believers\\" amongst Hindus and those who are not Hindus often consult a panjika for much of the practical information it publishes. It also records Muslim, Christian and other festivals, dates of birth and death of many leading personalities and carries informative articles on astrology.Bishudhasiddhanta Panjika, 1412 edition, Odia panji There are six panji in Odia: Asali Khadiratna Panjeeka, Biraja Panji, Bhagyadaya Panji, Kohinoor Panji, Gaudiya Vishnava Panjika and Madala Panji. Madala Panji is the first panjika in Indian regional language, starting from the 12th century. It is the main source and evidence of Odisha history. Pathani samanta Chandra Sekhar (1835 to 1904) has revived the Odia panjika in a scientific way.Madala Panji Pathani samanta Chandra Sekar ( 1835 to 1904) and the Gaudiya Vishnava Panjika Madala Panji (Odia: ମାଦଳ ପାଂଜି) is a chronicle of the Jagannath Temple, Puri in Odisha. It describes the historical events of Odisha related to Jagannath and the Jagannath Temple.[1] The Madala Panji dates from the 12th century.The Madala Panji was traditionally written on a year-to-year basis. On Vijayadashami Day, the Karanas (official history writers of Puri, a caste of Odisha, involved in keeping the chronicle. The tradition of keeping this chronicle began with Odia king Anantavarman Chodaganga Dev (1078–1150). According to the tradition, Chodaganga created 24 families of Karanas to preserve the temple records. Of these, five were entrusted with the writing and preservation of the Madala Panji. They are: * Panjia Karan—preserves the Madala Panji * Tadau Karan—writes the Madala Panji * Deula Karan—enforces the Madala * Kotha Karan—the main compiler * Baithi Karan—assistant Two schools of Bengali panjika-makers There are two schools of panjika-makers in Bengal – Driksiddhanta (Bisuddhasiddhanta Panjika) and Driksiddhanta (Gupta Press, PM Bagchi, etc.). They dictate the days on which festivals are to be held. Sometimes, they lay down different dates for particular festivals. For the Durga Puja in 2005, two different sets of dates came through. Some community pujas followed the Gupta Press Panjika, because of its popularity. It was with deference to convention, confirmed Pandit Nitai Chakraborty, president of Vaidik Pandit O Purohit Mahamilan Kendra. Belur Math adhered to Bisuddhasiddhanta Panjika. It was Swami Vijnanananda (who became Math president in 1937–38), an astrologer, who decided that Ramakrishna Mission would follow this almanac as it was more scientific. The difference occurs because the two schools follow different calendars of luni-solar movement on which tithis are based. While Gupta Press Panjika follows 16th century Raghunandan's work Ashtabingshatitatwa based on the 1,500-year-old astronomical treatise, Suryasiddhanta. Bisuddhasiddhanta Panjika is based on an 1890 amendment of the planetary positions given in Suryasiddhanta. Scientific reform The earliest Indian almanacs date back to around 1000 BCE. It did analyse time but the calculations were not always very accurate. Suryasiddhanta, produced in that era, was the forerunner of all later day panjikas. During British rule, Biswambhar again began the work of publishing the panjika, in handwritten book form. The printed version came in 1869. Bisuddhasiddhanta Panjika was first published in 1890. Gupta Press follows Suryasiddhanta with the original format while the version with \\"corrected\\" scripture is called Visuddhasiddhanta. The Bisuddhasiddhanta Panjika came into being because an astronomer Madhab Chandra Chattopadhyay, on studying the panjikas then in vogue found differences in the actual and astrological position of the planets and stars. He revised the panjika as per scientific readings. There were other people in different parts of India who also supported the approach for scientific revision of the panjika. It included such people as Pathani Samanta in Odisha and Bal Gangadhar Tilak in Pune.Bishudhasiddhanta Panjika, 1412 edition, p. ka 16, In 1952, a major revision of the panjika was undertaken under the aegis of the Indian government. The transformation Gupta Press, one of the Bengali panjikas, has come out in 2007 with a CD-version packed with interactive features like 'know your day', 'daily horoscope' and 'koshthi bichar' (horoscope). Transformation has been staple food for the panjika. With the passage of time it has added information, like tourist attractions, pilgrim destinations, telephone codes and general information that common people seek, to make it more attractive. The format has also been made more flexible to cater to the needs of varied groups. The variants like 'directory panjika' (magnum opus) 'full panjika' (thinner version) and 'half panjika' (abridged version) and 'pocket panjika' have different price tags. The pocket panjika is a hawkers' delight on local trains. Madan Gupter Full Panjika, which came out in the 1930s, has not changed much externally. The cover is still the same, on thick pink paper, but the inside is very different. The pages have changed from coarse newsprint to smooth white paper, the letter press has made way for offset printing, wooden blocks have been replaced by sharp photographs. The biggest difference is in the ad-editorial ratio. Previously the ads formed the bulk of the printed matter – and were pure delight. \\"When there was no TV and not so many newspapers, the panjika was the place to advertise for many products. Many people bought panjikas for the ads,\\" says the owner Mahendra Kumar Gupta, \\"They would offer solutions to many 'incurable' diseases.\\" The 1938 edition started off with a full-page ad on an \\"Electric Solution\\", which promised to revive dead men. Now they publish Durga Puja timings in London, Washington and New York, based on the sunset and sunrise there. According to Arijit Roychowdhury, managing director of Gupta Press, panjika sales plunged after partition of India, as the market was lost in the eastern part of the former state. However, with innovative transformation of format and content, sales have been picking up and the overall annual market in 2007 is 2 million copies. The figure includes sales in the US and the UK. Panjikas have found their way into modern day shopping malls also. A senior official of the RPG group, Mani Shankar Mukherjee, himself a reputed author, said, \\"Our Spencer's store in Gurgaon has sold a record number of panjikas.\\" Bengali panjikas follow the Bengali calendar and are normally out in the month of Choitro, so that people can buy it well before Pohela Baishakh.

He was Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor of England. He used the wealth these positions gave him to establish both the school and a university college, New College, Oxford, in 1382; both of them were set up to provide an education for 70 scholars. Winchester College opened in 1394. William of Wykeham provided that up to two pupils a year who could prove they were his descendants could attend the school at its expense; they were known as Consanguineus Fundatoris, \\"Founder's Kin\\". Ranulph Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes records that the tradition ended in 1868, by which time fourteen members of his family had received a free education. At first only a small number of pupils other than scholars were admitted; by the 15th century the school had around 100 pupils in total, nominally the 70 scholars, 16 choirboys and the rest \\"commoners\\". Demand for places for commoners was high, and though at first restricted, numbers gradually rose. From the 1860s, ten boarding houses, each for up to sixty pupils, were added, greatly increasing the school's capacity. By 2020, the number of pupils had risen to 690. The school's traditions include a 600-year- old ceremony in which the Warden, wearing the Founder's Ring, admits each new Scholar; \\"Illumina\\", an autumn celebration, in which candles are placed into niches all over the medieval walls around the playing fields; and \\"Morning Hills\\", held once a year, when all the school's pupils and teachers climb St Catherine's Hill for a roll call and prayers. The Ad Portas (\\"At the Gates\\") ceremony is held as an honour for distinguished guests and alumni; all members of the school stand in the medieval Chamber Court to hear the speeches. In 2011, nineteen alumni (and six more honoured in their absence), all Fellows of the Royal Society or Fellows of the British Academy, were welcomed Ad Portas, with speeches in Latin and English. Among the Old Wykehamists listed here are four archbishops, including one of the school's earliest pupils, Henry Chichele; four field marshals; commanders of both Fighter Command and Bomber Command during the Second World War—Hugh Dowding and Charles Portal, respectively; and two Viceroys of India, Archibald Wavell and Frederic Thesiger. The many politicians include six Chancellors of the Exchequer: Henry Addington for the Tory Party; Robert Lowe for the Liberal Party; Stafford Cripps and Hugh Gaitskell for the Labour Party; and Geoffrey Howe and Rishi Sunak for the Conservative Party. Of these Henry Addington went on to become Prime Minister. The individuals listed are classified by decade or century of birth, with a note of how each distinguished himself. Those who won military medals are listed at the foot of the page; six Old Wykehamists have won Britain's highest military award, the Victoria Cross. Individuals are included here only if they have distinguished themselves at the highest level within their profession or achieved national recognition. Thus, for example, politicians are included only if they are members of the privy council or have a cabinet position; sportspeople, only if they have distinguished themselves in a national competition or represented their country; for soldiers, that they have reached a rank equivalent to major-general, or won a gallantry award; members of a profession, that they are recognised as distinguished by their profession's leading institution, such as being a fellow of the Royal Society or the Royal Academy of Music. As another example, national recognition in business means being chair or chief executive of a FTSE 100 company.

The postage stamps and postal history of Armenia describes the history of postage stamps and postal systems in Armenia. Czarist Russian postmarks and stamps were in used in the territory of Armenia from 1858. The early postmarks were composed of dots in different shapes. Dated postmarks with city names soon followed. Many counterfeit postmarks are known.Hovanesian, pp. 20–24. From 1909 until 1918 a few Russian stamps were overprinted identifying the Armenian Post. The Armenian letters H & P are intertwined, representing the initials of hai post, the Armenian Post Office.Hovanesian, pp. 26, 41–42. First Republic of Armenia The First Republic of Armenia was founded on May 28, 1918, but stamps were first issued in 1919 overprinted on Russia. In 1919 Arshak Fetvadjian was commissioned to design and supervise production of stamps for the new republic. Ten stamps were designed in different denominations and printed in Paris. Due to the occupation of Armenia they were never delivered and few were printed, so no genuine uses are known and many forged stamps are recorded.Hovanesian, pp. 59–74. The stamps were sold to stamp collectors and dealers in Paris during 1924 and Hovanesian suggests that the Armenian government in exile (Dashnak Party) did this because they needed money to finance their activities,. Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic 1923 Transcaucasian stamp Between 1922 and 1991 Armenia was initially part of the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic which officially became the Armenian SSR in 1936. From 1922 the country issued its own definitives; and from 1923 used overprinted Russian stamps, and as a constituent of the Transcaucasian Federation, that specifically produced 15 stamps of their own, used the federation stamps though they were only in use until 1924. These stamps are known both perforated and imperforate and the 40,000 Rs and 75,000 Rs stamps were also surcharged with an overprint 700,000 Rs.Hovanesian, pp. 126–132. From 1924, upon a decree from the central government of the USSR, only regular Soviet Union issued stamps were in use until November 1991. During this period several stamps with Armenian nationalistic and ethnic topics were issued by the central government,Hovanesian, p. 144. such as a 1950 set of three stamps to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Armenian Republic, views of Erevan with Mount Ararat in 1960, and Armenian national costumes in 1961 and notable Armenian personalities.Hovanesian, pp. 149–150. Post-Soviet independence 1992 – first stamps of the new Republic of Armenia Following the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union, Armenia became an independent state on September 21, 1991 though the first stamps, a se-tenant trio, were issued on April 28, 1992 to commemorate Independence Day. On July 26, another set of four stamps was issued for the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympic Games before the first new definitives appeared on August 25 of the same year.Hovanesian, pp. 267–272. Other definitives depict such topics as, religious artefacts, landscapes, David of Sasun and the 1993 International Philatelic Exhibition.Hovanesian, pp. 273–277. The first stamps to be issued in the new Armenian currency, the dram, that was introduced to replace the rouble used for the previous issues since independence, appeared on August 4, 1994 illustrating treasures of Etchmiadzin. Notable people stamps were issued for Levon Shant and Yervand Otian in 1994 along with four new definitives and Christianity themed stamps.Hovanesian, pp. 278–281.

He is a former mayor of the City of Fremantle, a position he held for eight and a half years. Background Tagliaferri's grandfather migrated to Australia in 1932 and, after working in the mines for seven years, his father Osvaldo also migrated. Osvaldo died of leukemia in 1983 when Tagliaferri was a 23-year-old, leaving him with the responsibility of family, mortgage and the family business (Interfoods). He was born in East Fremantle, and educated at Lady of Fatima in Palmyra, St Brendan's in Beaconsfield and in 1977 graduated from Christian Brothers College, Fremantle. His background is retailing, manufacturing and farming in York. Career Tagliaferri first involvement with local government came that same year, in an effort to speak up for the concerns of southern suburbs residents, oppose a highway through Beaconsfield and address parking and retail issues. He was first elected to council in 1983; representing the East Ward, at the time becoming the youngest person ever elected to local government in Western Australia.STM, Sunday Times, 2008 He was elected mayor in 2001 and re-elected in 2005 — the first mayor to be re- elected since John Cattalini, who served from 1984-1994. Tagliaferri's principal platform in the 2001 mayoral election was reclaiming Fremantle for its residents, strong financial management and an open-door policy. He was elected in by 1000 votes and was successfully re-elected as mayor in 2005, winning 62% of the 8711 votes. In 2003, he was awarded the Centenary Medal and in 2004 was awarded the Champion for the Year of the Built Environment. He received the Heart Foundation President's Award in 2007 in recognition of work to ensure a smoke-free environment in Fremantle and is patron of The One World Project, as well as being a Mayor for Peace. Prior to the 2007 federal election, Tagliaferri criticised the Labor Party's selection of Melissa Parke to succeed outgoing member Carmen Lawrence in the federal division of Fremantle. Tagliaferri was unhappy with Parke's selection because she came from outside the district and threatened to stand as an independent against her. He subsequently declined to run, and Parke won the seat easily. The long- running state member for Fremantle, Jim McGinty, announced his retirement on 3 April 2009. Tagliaferri immediately emerged as the favourite to win Labor preselection in the Fremantle by-election, and was unanimously preselected by the state administrative committee on 7 April. He was defeated by Greens challenger Adele Carles on 16 May - the first time a Labor candidate has lost in Fremantle since 1924. He chose not to run for mayor again in the October 2009 elections, after two successful terms, and was succeeded by Brad Pettit. He now runs a hotel in Manjimup in the south of Western Australia.

The Chords Bridge (, Gesher HaMeitarim), also called the Bridge of Strings or Jerusalem Light Rail Bridge, is a side- spar cable-stayed bridge in Jerusalem, Israel. The structure was designed by the Spanish architect and engineer Santiago Calatrava and is used by Jerusalem Light Rail's Red Line, which began service on August 19, 2011. Incorporated in the bridge is a glass-sided pedestrian bridge enabling pedestrians to cross from Kiryat Moshe to the Jerusalem Central Bus Station. The bridge, which cost about $70 million (NIS 246 million), was inaugurated on June 25, 2008. History Calatrava first visited Israel for the opening of an exhibition of his works in Haifa in 1997. During that visit, he was invited to design a pedestrian bridge in Petah Tikva, which was opened in 2005. He was invited to Jerusalem by city engineer Uri Shetrit and former mayor Ehud Olmert, who, according to Calatrava, challenged him to \\"do the most beautiful contemporary bridge\\". Construction of the Chords Bridge began in 2005, with an estimated cost of NIS 129 million, far higher than the initial forecast of NIS 80 million. Design and symbolism The bridge was designed to add a defining visual element to the Jerusalem \\"skyline\\" at the entrance to the city, and to carry a light rail system, expected to solve some of the city's traffic problems. For Calatrava the bridge is \\"also the excuse to create a major plaza, to give character and unity to this delicate place\\". Similar to Calatrava's Puente del Alamillo in Seville, Spain, the bridge makes use of an angled cantilever tower to absorb some of the load and reduce the number of cable stays needed. The bridge consists of a single pylon counterbalancing a span with lengths of cables, making a dramatic architectural statement. While this is Calatrava's 40th bridge, it is the first he has designed to carry both train and pedestrian traffic. A striking feature of the bridge is a single high mast supporting the roadway via 66 steel cables arranged in a parabolic shape which develops three-dimensionally in space, making it the tallest structure in Jerusalem at the time of its completion. The exterior of the bridge is mostly clad in Jerusalem stone, with steel, glass and concrete detailing. Dubbed \\"Jerusalem's first shrine of modern design\\" by Time Magazine, the bridge has become a tourist attraction. The form of the bridge resembles a tent in the desert or a harp, with the cables as the strings, symbolising King David's harp, according to Calatrava, others interpret the looming pylon as the bust of a long-necked bird, a human arm or an arrow caught in a bow. Acceptance and criticism The project was accepted with great controversy. Supporters, such as architectural historian David Kroyanker, said that the bridge helps developing western Jerusalem and its modern requirements. Overall, however, the project has been criticized as an extravagant and costly solution to a problem that could have been solved by cheaper means, the final cost of over $70 million exceeding the original budget more than twofold. The aesthetics of the bridge and its impact on Jerusalem have also sparked controversy. Some say the bridge, situated at the city's crowded entrance, does not have enough space around it for people to appreciate its artistic merit, while others feel that the bridge is simply out of its element and question whether it fits visually in the city. The bridge's dedication ceremony, a $500,000 extravaganza, also drew criticism, particularly as young female dancers, subsequently dubbed the \\"Taliban troupe\\", were compelled to wear long skirts and cover their hair after ultra- Orthodox Jews threatened to disrupt the ceremony.

This contrasts with the traditional approach, in which taxon names are defined by a type, which can be a specimen or a taxon of lower rank, and a description in words. Phylogenetic nomenclature is currently not regulated, but the International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature (PhyloCode) is intended to regulate it once it is ratified. Definitions The clade shown by the dashed lines in each figure is specified by the ancestor X. Under the hypothesis that the relationships are as in the left tree, the clade includes X, A, B and C. Under the hypothesis that the relationships are as in the right tree, the clade includes X, A and B. Phylogenetic nomenclature ties names to clades, groups consisting of an ancestor and all its descendants. These groups can equivalently be called monophyletic. There are slightly different ways of specifying the ancestor, which are discussed below. Once the ancestor is specified, the meaning of the name is fixed: the ancestor and all organisms which are its descendants are included in the named taxon. Listing all these organisms (i.e. providing a full circumscription) requires the full phylogenetic tree to be known. In practice, there are only one or more hypotheses as to the correct tree. Different hypotheses lead to different organisms being thought to be included in the named taxon, but do not affect what organisms the name actually applies to. In this sense the name is independent of theory revision. =Phylogenetic definitions of clade names= Phylogenetic nomenclature ties names to clades, groups consisting solely of an ancestor and all its descendants. All that is needed to specify a clade, therefore, is to designate the ancestor. There are a number of ways of doing this. Commonly, the ancestor is indicated by its relation to two or more specifiers (species, specimens, or traits) that are mentioned explicitly. The diagram shows three common ways of doing this. For previously defined clades A, B, and C, the clade X can be defined as: phylogenetic hypothesis on the relations of A, B and C. *A node-based definition could read: \\"the last common ancestor of A and B, and all descendants of that ancestor\\". Thus, the entire line below the junction of A and B does not belong to the clade to which the name with this definition refers. ::Example: The sauropod dinosaurs consist of the last common ancestor of Vulcanodon (A) and Apatosaurus (B) and all of that ancestor's descendants. This ancestor was the first sauropod. C could include other dinosaurs like Stegosaurus. *A branch-based definition, often called a stem-based definition, could read: \\"the first ancestor of A which is not also an ancestor of C, and all descendants of that ancestor\\". Thus, the entire line below the junction of A and B (other than the bottommost point) does belong to the clade to which the name with this definition refers. ::Example: The rodents consist of the first ancestor of the house mouse (A) that is not also an ancestor of the eastern cottontail rabbit (C) together with all descendants of that ancestor. Here, the ancestor is the very first rodent. B is some other descendant, perhaps the red squirrel. *An apomorphy-based definition could read: \\"the first ancestor of A to possess trait M that is inherited by A, and all descendants of that ancestor\\". In the diagram, M evolves at the intersection of the horizontal line with the tree. Thus, the clade to which the name with this definition refers contains that part of the line below the last common ancestor of A and B which corresponds to ancestors possessing the apomorphy M. The lower part of the line is excluded. It is not required that B have trait M; it may have disappeared in the lineage leading to B. ::Example: the tetrapods consist of the first ancestor of humans (A) from which humans inherited limbs with fingers or toes (M) and all descendants of that ancestor. These descendants include snakes (B), which do not have limbs. Several other alternatives are provided in the PhyloCode,. (see below) though there is no attempt to be exhaustive. Phylogenetic nomenclature allows the use, not only of ancestral relations, but also of the property of being extant. One of the many ways of specifying the Neornithes (modern birds), for example, is: :::The Neornithes consist of the last common ancestor of the extant members of the most inclusive clade containing the cockatoo Cacatua galerita but not the dinosaur Stegosaurus armatus as well as all descendants of that ancestor. Neornithes is a crown clade, a clade for which the last common ancestor of its extant members is also the last common ancestor of all its members. = Node names = * Crown node: Most recent common ancestor of the sampled species of the clade of interest * Stem node: Most recent common ancestor of the clade of interest and its sister clade =Ancestry-based definitions of the names of paraphyletic and polyphyletic taxa= In the PhyloCode, only a clade can receive a \\"phylogenetic definition\\", and this restriction is observed in the present article. However, it is also possible to create definitions for the names of other groups that are phylogenetic in the sense that they use only ancestral relations anchored on species or specimens. For example, assuming Mammalia and Aves (birds) are defined in this manner, Reptilia could be defined as \\"the most recent common ancestor of Mammalia and Aves and all its descendants except Mammalia and Aves\\". This is an example of a paraphyletic group, a clade minus one or more subordinate clades. Names of polyphyletic groups, characterized by a trait that evolved convergently in two or more subgroups, can similarly be defined as the sum of multiple clades. Ranks Under the traditional nomenclature codes, such as the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, taxa that are not explicitly associated with a rank cannot be formally named, because the application of a name to a taxon is based on both a type and a rank. The requirement for a rank is a major difference between traditional and phylogenetic nomenclature. It has several consequences: it limits the number of nested levels at which names can be applied; it causes the endings of names to change if a group has its rank changed, even if it has precisely the same members (i.e. the same circumscription); and it is logically inconsistent with all taxa being monophyletic. Especially in recent decades (due to advances in phylogenetics), taxonomists have named many \\"nested\\" taxa (i.e. taxa which are contained inside other taxa). No system of nomenclature attempts to name every clade; this would be particularly difficult in traditional nomenclature since every named taxon must be given a lower rank than any named taxon in which it is nested, so the number of names that can be assigned in a nested set of taxa can be no greater than the number of generally recognized ranks. Gauthier et al. (1988)Gauthier, J., Estes, R. & de Queiroz, K. 1988. A Phylogenetic Analysis of Lepidosauromorpha. Pp. 15–98 in R. Estes & G. Pregill (eds): Phylogenetic Relationships of the Lizard Families: Essays Commemorating Charles L. Camp. Stanford University Press. suggested that, if Reptilia is assigned its traditional rank of class, then a phylogenetic classification has to assign the rank of genus to Aves. In such a classification, all ~12,000 known species of extant and extinct birds would then have to be incorporated into this genus. Various solutions have been proposed while keeping the rank- based nomenclature codes. Patterson and Rosen (1977)Patterson, C. & Rosen, D. 1977 Review of ichthyodectiform and other Mesozoic teleost fishes and the theory and practice of classifying fossils. Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History 158: 81–172. suggested nine new ranks between family and superfamily in order to be able to classify a clade of herrings, and McKenna and Bell (1997)McKenna, M. C. & Bell, S. K. 1997. Classification of Mammals Above the Species Level. Columbia University Press. introduced a large array of new ranks in order to cope with the diversity of Mammalia; these have not been widely adopted. In botany, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, responsible for the currently most widely used classification of flowering plants, chose a different approach. They retained the traditional ranks of family and order, considering them to be of value in teaching and in studying relationships between taxa, but also introduced named clades without formal ranks. The current codes also have rules stating that names must have certain endings depending on the rank of the taxa to which they are applied. When a group has a different rank in different classifications, its name must have a different suffix. Ereshefsky (1997:512) gave an example. He noted that Simpson in 1963 and Wiley in 1981 agreed that the same group of genera, which included the genus Homo, should be placed together in a taxon. Simpson treated this taxon as a family, and so gave it the name \\"Hominidae\\": \\"Homin-\\" from \\"Homo\\" and \\"-idae\\" as the family ending under the zoological code. Wiley considered it to be at the rank of tribe, and so gave it the name \\"Hominini\\", \\"-ini\\" being the tribe ending. Wiley's tribe Hominini formed only part of a family which he called \\"Hominidae\\". Thus, under the zoological code, two groups with precisely the same circumscription were given different names (Simpson's Hominidae and Wiley's Hominini) and two groups with the same name had different circumscriptions (Simpson's Hominidae and Wiley's Hominidae). In phylogenetic nomenclature, ranks have no bearing on the spelling of taxon names (see e.g. Gauthier (1994)Gauthier, J. A. 1994. The diversification of the amniotes. Pp. 129–159 in: D. R. Prothero & Rainer R. Schoch (eds): Major features of vertebrate evolution. Paleontological Society. and the PhyloCode). Ranks are, however, not altogether forbidden in phylogenetic nomenclature. They are merely decoupled from nomenclature: they do not influence which names can be used, which taxa are associated with which names, and which names can refer to nested taxa. The principles of traditional rank-based nomenclature are logically incompatible with all taxa being strictly monophyletic. Every organism must belong to a genus, for example, so there would have to be a genus for every common ancestor of the mammals and the birds. For such a genus to be monophyletic, it would have to include both the class Mammalia and the class Aves. In rank-based nomenclature, however, classes must include genera, not the other way around. Philosophy The conflict between phylogenetic and traditional nomenclature reflects differing views of the metaphysics of taxa. For the advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature, a taxon is an individual, an entity that gains and loses attributes as time passes. Just as a person does not become somebody else when his or her properties change through maturation, senility, or more radical changes like amnesia, the loss of a limb, or a change in sex, so a taxon remains the same entity whatever characteristics are gained or lost. For any individual, there has to be something that connects its temporal stages in virtue of which it remains the same thing. For a person, the spatiotemporal continuity of the body provides the relevant connection; from infancy to old age, the body traces a continuous path through the world and it is this path, rather than any characteristics of the individual, that connects the baby and the octogenarian. For a taxon, if characteristics are not relevant, it can only be ancestral relations that connect the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti with the modern monarch butterfly as representatives, separated by 400 million years, of the taxon Insecta. If ancestry is sufficient for the continuity of a taxon, however, then all descendants of a taxon member will also be included in the taxon, so all bona fide taxa are monophyletic; the names of paraphyletic groups do not merit formal recognition. As \\"Pelycosauria\\" refers to a paraphyletic group that includes some Permian tetrapods but not their extant descendants, it cannot be admitted as a valid taxon name. To the adherent of traditional nomenclature, on the other hand, taxa are sets or classes. Unlike individuals, they are constituted by similarities, characteristics shared among their members.Entry for \\"taxon\\" in: Monophyletic groups are particularly worthy of attention and naming primarily because they often share properties of interest. Since many paraphyletic groups also share such properties, plesiomorphies in their case, providing them with names is also conducive to productive research. Such naming is strongly defended by some scientists; in a 2005 letter to the editors of the journal Taxon, 150 biologists from around the world joined in defense of paraphyletic taxa. For Darwin, they pointed out, evolution involved descent and modification, not just descent. Taxa, for them, are sets of organisms united by similarity; when the similarity is too weak, descendants are not in all of their ancestors' taxa. History Monophyletic phylogenetic tree of organisms\\".Haeckel, E. H. Ph. A. 1866. Generelle Morphologie der Organismen. Georg Reimer. Phylogenetic nomenclature is a result of the general acceptance of branching in the course of evolution, represented in the diagrams of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and later writers like Charles Darwin and Ernst Haeckel. In 1866, Haeckel for the first time constructed a single tree of all life and immediately proceeded to translate it into a classification. This classification was rank-based, as was usual at the time, but did not contain taxa that Haeckel considered polyphyletic. In it, Haeckel introduced the rank of phylum which carries a connotation of monophyly in its name (literally meaning \\"stem\\"). Ever since, it has been debated in which ways and to what extent the phylogeny of life should be used as a basis for its classification, with views ranging from \\"numerical taxonomy\\" (phenetics) over \\"evolutionary taxonomy\\" (gradistics) to \\"phylogenetic systematics\\". From the 1960s onwards, rankless classifications were occasionally proposed, but in general the principles of rank-based nomenclature were used by all three schools of thought. Most of the basic tenets of phylogenetic nomenclature (lack of obligatory ranks, and something close to phylogenetic definitions) can, however, be traced to 1916, when Edwin Goodrich interpreted the name Sauropsida, erected 40 years earlier by T. H. Huxley, to include the birds (Aves) as well as part of Reptilia, and coined the new name Theropsida to include the mammals as well as another part of Reptilia. Goodrich did not give them ranks, and treated them exactly as if they had phylogenetic definitions, using neither contents nor diagnostic characters to decide whether a given animal should belong to Theropsida, Sauropsida, or something else once its phylogenetic position was agreed upon. Goodrich also opined that the name Reptilia should be abandoned once the phylogeny of the reptiles would be better known. The principle that only clades should be formally named became popular in some circles in the second half of the 20th century. It spread together with the methods for discovering clades (cladistics) and is an integral part of phylogenetic systematics (see above). At the same time, it became apparent that the obligatory ranks that are part of the traditional systems of nomenclature produced problems. Some authors suggested abandoning them altogether, starting with Willi Hennig's abandonmentHennig, W. 1969. Die Stammesgeschichte der Insekten. Waldemar Kramer. of his earlier proposal to define ranks as geological age classes.Hennig, W. 1950. Grundzüge einer Theorie der phylogenetischen Systematik. Deutscher Zentralverlag. The first use of phylogenetic nomenclature in a publication can be dated to 1986.Gauthier, J. 1986. Saurischian Monophyly and the Origin of Birds. Pp. 1–55 in K. Padian (ed.): The Origin of Birds and the Evolution of Flight. Memoir 8 of the California Academy of Sciences. Theoretical papers outlining the principles of phylogenetic nomenclature, as well as further publications containing applications of phylogenetic nomenclature (mostly to vertebrates), soon followed (see Literature section). In an attempt to avoid a schism in the biologist community, \\"Gauthier suggested to two members of the ICZN to apply formal taxonomic names ruled by the zoological code only to clades (at least for supraspecific taxa) and to abandon Linnean ranks, but these two members promptly rejected these ideas\\" (Laurin, 2008: 224). This led Kevin de Queiroz and the botanist Philip Cantino to start drafting their own code of nomenclature, the PhyloCode, for regulating phylogenetic nomenclature. Controversy Willi Hennig's pioneering work provoked a spirited debate about the relative merits of phylogenetic nomenclature versus Linnaean taxonomy, or the related approach of evolutionary taxonomy, which has continued down to the present. Some of the debates in which the cladists were engaged had been running since the 19th century. While Hennig insisted that different classification schemes were useful for different purposes, he gave primacy to his own, claiming that the categories of his system had \\"individuality and reality\\" in contrast to the \\"timeless abstractions\\" of morphology-based classifications. Formal classifications based on cladistic reasoning are said to emphasize ancestry at the expense of descriptive characteristics. Nonetheless, most taxonomists today avoid paraphyletic groups whenever they think it is possible within Linnaean taxonomy; polyphyletic taxa have long fallen out of fashion. The International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature The ICPN, or PhyloCode, is a draft code of rules and recommendations for phylogenetic nomenclature. * The ICPN will only regulate clade names. Names for para- or polyphyletic taxa, and names for species (which may or may not be clades), will not be considered, at least not at first. This means that the regulation of species names will be left, for the time being, to the rank-based codes of nomenclature. * The Principle of Priority will be introduced for names and for definitions. The starting point for priority will be the publication date of the ICPN. * Definitions for existing names, and new names along with their definitions, will have to be published in peer-reviewed works (on or after the starting date) and will have to be registered in an online database in order to be valid. The number of supporters for widespread adoption of the PhyloCode is still small, and it is uncertain (as of ) when the code will be implemented and how widely it will be followed.

It was developed and designed by the Israeli company Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. It is available in man-portable, vehicle-launched, and helicopter-launched variants. As well as engaging and destroying targets within the line-of-sight of the launcher (\\"fire-and-forget\\"), some variants of the missile are capable of making a top attack through a \\"fire, observe and update\\" method (essentially lock-on after launch); the operator tracking the target, or switching to another target, optically through the trailing fiber- optic wire (or RF link in the case of the vehicle-mounted, long-range NLOS variant) while the missile is climbing to altitude after launch. This is similar to the lofted trajectory flight profile of the US FGM-148 Javelin. Design Cut away diagram of Spike ATGM. Frontal close-up of the Spike missile's Command & launch unit (CLU) with thermal-imaging sight, tripod mount and an attached dummy missile canister. Spike is a fire-and-forget missile with lock-on before launch and automatic self-guidance. The missile is equipped with an imaging infrared seeker. The long and extended range versions of the Spike also have the capability of \\"Fire, Observe and Update\\" operating mode (also known as Lock-on after launch (LOAL)). The missile is connected by a fiber-optical wire that is spooled out between the launch position and the missile. With this, the operator can obtain a target if it is not in the line of sight of the operator at launch, switch targets in flight, or compensate for the movement of the target if the missile is not tracking the target for some reason. Hence, the missile can be fired speculatively for a target of opportunity, or to provide observation on the other side of an obstacle. The missile has a soft launch capability – the motor firing after the missile has left the launcher – that allows for the missile to be fired from confined spaces, which is a necessity in urban warfare. The missile uses a tandem warhead consisting of two shaped charges: a precursor warhead to detonate any explosive reactive armor, and a primary warhead to penetrate the underlying armor. Currently, it is replacing aging second generation anti-tank missiles like the MILAN and M47 Dragon in the armies of the user nations. Spike missile is also equipped with heat chasing technology. The Spike system is made up of the launching tripod with its fire control unit and the missile. There is no dedicated thermal sight on the launcher – the missile's imaging seeker is used. Altogether, the long range variant of the system weighs around . Spike can be operated from the launcher by infantry, or from mounts that can be fitted to vehicles such as fast attack vehicles, armoured personnel carriers or utility vehicles. Vehicles that are not normally fitted with anti-tank weapons can therefore be given anti-tank capability. Spike has been tested as a weapon system for the SAGEM Sperwer unmanned aerial vehicle. The Spanish Army has fitted the Spike-ER to its Eurocopter Tiger attack helicopters. Both Israel and the United States have experimented with arming Black Hawk helicopters with the Spike missile; the US variant is used in UH-60M Battlehawk helicopters. Marketing In order to facilitate the selling of the weapon system in Europe, the company EuroSpike GmbH was formed in Germany. Its shareholders Diehl Defence (40%), Rheinmetall Defence Electronics (40%) and Rafael via ERCAS B.V (20%). ERCAS B.V. is a Dutch holding company owned 100% by Rafael. EuroSpike GmbH is located in Röthenbach, Germany. The European variant of the Spike weapon system differs a little from the Israeli version and is marketed under the name EuroSpike. For other areas of the world, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. is solely responsible. Variants The reusable Command & launch unit (CLU), battery, tripod and the thermal sight are common for both MR and LR versions of the Spike missile family, each weighing , , , and respectively. =Spike-SR= The short range version of the weapon was unveiled in 2012 to give infantrymen a guided missile between the larger Spike-MR and unguided rockets.RAFAEL Unveils a Light, Affordable Member of the Spike Missile Family - Defense-Update.com, 14 February 2012 The missile is for a disposable munition for use at platoon-level whose minimum range is and whose maximum range is . It is equipped with a stiff-necked uncooled electro- optical infrared seeker and advanced tracker, as opposed to the gimballed seeker in the Spike MR/LR/ER versions. The Spike-SR does not require a separate sight, instead utilizing the low-cost thermal camera and guidance electronics strapped to the missile's nose to provide this function through a display integrated into the launcher, showing the target until launch.Enhancing The New Spike Family - Defense-Update.com, 31 December 2010 The warhead can either be a multi-purpose tandem shaped-charge warhead with blast-fragmentation effect or a new Penetration-Blast-Fragmentation (PBF) variant leveraged from the MATADOR's anti-structure warhead to equip maneuvering forces in urban environments to breach enemy cover and structures with a lethal blast effect.

The weight of the missile is , and the weight of the complete system is less than . Maximum range is and it is used by infantry and light combat vehicles. It adds fiber-optic communication to and from the operator during flight. Reported armour penetration capability is more than of Rolled homogeneous armour (RHA). It is also deployed by Sentry Tech remotely controlled weapons stations along the Gaza border. In early 2014, Rafael revealed they had increased the range of the Spike-LR to , enhancing versatility on existing firing platforms and allowing it to be utilized on new ones like light helicopters. Spike-LR II Spike LR 2 A new generation of the original Spike-LR is in full-scale development and scheduled to be operational by the end of 2018. Spike-LR II (Israeli designation: Gil-2, גיל 2) has reduced weight to , increased range of at ground level and from helicopters using an RF data-link, warhead options of tandem HEAT with 30% increased armor penetration or a multipurpose blast warhead with selectable impact or penetration detonation fusing, a new seeker that includes an uncooled IR sensor with a smart target tracker with artificial intelligence features, the ability to fire on grid target coordinates using an inertial measurement unit for third party-target allocation, and is compatible with legacy launchers. The missile is designed with a counter-active protection system (CAPS) capability, being able to hit targets at higher impact angles of up to 70 degrees.Rafael Advanced Defense Systems unveils its fifth generation SPIKE LR II Missile - Armyrecognition.com, 29 May 2017 First ordered by the IDF in October 2017.Rafael to supply IDF with new 5th gen Spike LR2 guided missiles - Armyrecognition.com, 24 October 2017 =Spike-ER= Extended range or extra- long range version of the weapon (Israeli designation: NT-Dandy or NT-D). It has a minimum range of 400 m and a maximum range of . It has a larger diameter and is heavier than the other systems, and is usually vehicle mounted. It is used by infantry, Light Combat Vehicle (LCVs), and helicopters. The Finnish Navy's Coastal Jaegers and Philippine Navy's Multi-purpose Attack Craft Mk.III also operate this version in the anti-ship role. The weight of the missile is , the launchers are and respectively for the vehicle and air-launched versions. Penetration is around of RHA. Spike-ER II In August 2018, Rafael disclosed the development of an enhancement of the missile called the Spike-ER II. It retains the same weight, airframe, surface geometries, and propulsion unit but introduces a two-way RF data-link to increase real-time control to an extended range of from helicopters; it also has an extended fiber optic link to increase range to from land and naval platforms. =Spike NLOS= \\"Non Line Of Sight\\" is an ultra long-range version of the weapon (Israeli designation: Tamuz, תמוז), with a claimed maximum range of . It is a significantly larger missile than other Spike variants, with an overall weight of around . It can be launched from the ground or from helicopters. It was developed following lessons learned in the Yom Kippur War, which showed a need for a high-precision guided tactical ground-to-ground battlefield missile. The first variants entered service with the IDF in tandem with the Pereh missile carrier in 1981, though the existence of both was not revealed to the public until 2011. The Spike NLOS uses a fiber optic link similar to other Spike versions, but only out to 8 km, after which it employs a radio data link for command guidance.NT Spike . Teal Group. March 2018. In 2011 it also became known that in a highly unusual move, the British Army was hastily equipped with the missile, drawn directly from IDF inventory after being exposed to increasing insurgent attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan beginning in 2007 with three variants of the NLOS being procured. A total of 600 missiles was acquired, the breakdown being 200 NLOS MK.2 in 2007, 200 NLOS MK.4 in 2008 (together with the MK.2 these were known as Exactor-1) and 200 NLOS MK.5 (Exactor-2) in 2009. For operational security, the codename of 'Exactor missile' was assigned in British service and it was initially mounted on launchers atop leased M113 APCs. Later on, the missile was fired from a separate trailer launcher instead, ditching the non-standard M113 APCs altogether. In a deal concluded on 6 September 2011, the South Korean government had agreed to purchase an unknown number of Spike NLOS missiles.8 September 2011, . Retrieved 13 October 2011. Rafael is working on expanding the missile's versatility by enhancing the existing EO-IR/CCD seeker with semi-active laser (SAL) capability and different anti-armor, blast- penetration, and high-explosive fragmentation warheads to meet specific applications. In 2020 the US Army announced its intention to procure Spike NLOS missiles to be mounted on Apache helicopters. https://www.defensenews.com/land/2020/01/09/army-to-field-israeli-made-long- range-missile-on-helicopters =Mini-Spike= On 2 September 2009, at an IDF exhibition held at the 3rd Latrun annual land warfare conference, the Israeli Defense Force unveiled a new member of the Spike family of missiles – the Mini Spike Anti-personnel guided weapon (APGW). Rafael claimed that this latest member of the Spike family of missile costs and weighed only a third of the Spike-LR at , while offering a longer engagement range of when compared to the Spike-SR. It was to introduce new flight modes to enable precision strikes in urban areas, such as flying through an open windows or attacking an enemy hidden behind defilade or obstacles using non-line-of-sight engagement. Mini Spike would use the same launcher and sight system of the Spike-LR, loading the missile on a special adaptor. By 2016, Mini-Spike development had been discontinued.

Eustace was a leader during the Barons' War in 1215 and was killed while undertaking a siege of Barnard Castle in 1216. Early life His parents were William de Vesci and Burga de Stuteville, daughter of Robert III de Stuteville. He paid his relief on coming of age in 1190. He was with King Richard I of England in Palestine in 1191. On 13 August 1199 he appeared as one of the guarantors of the treaty between the new king John of England and Renaud I, Count of Dammartin, and in the same year, probably later, he was sent to William the Lion of Scotland to promise him satisfaction of his rights in England, and witnessed his homage on 22 November 1200. He witnessed charters frequently in the early years of John's reign, in 1209 was one of the guardians of the bishopric of Durham, and on 10 April of the same year he was sent to meet William The Lion on his visit to England. He was serving the king in Ireland from June to August 1210. Accused of conspiring against John in 1212, he fled to Scotland. A tale of John's attempted seduction of his wife, and the trick played on him, first appears in Walter of Hemingburgh and bears a close resemblance to a classical model. His lands were seized, but after John's submission to the pope he was forced to invite Vescy back (27 May 1213), though orders were sent on the same day to Philip of Oldcoates to cripple him by destroying his castle of Alnwick. On 18 July 1213 he was one of the recipients of John's pledge to abide by the decision of the pope concerning the things about which he had been excommunicated. On 5 November 1214 Pope Innocent III warned him not to trouble the king. The Barons' Revolt He was a leader in the First Barons' War, in 1215 marching south against King John I with Robert Fitzwalter.; He was prominent among the barons who wrung Magna Carta from John, and was one of the twenty-five appointed to see it carried out. He was excommunicated by name with others of the barons in 1216. He supported in the confused situation ensuing Louis, the French dauphin, who was claiming the English throne.Jim Bradbury, Philip Augustus (1998), p.318. He was killed at a siege of Barnard Castle; while he accompanied Alexander II of Scotland on his way to do homage to Louis of France, on the way they laid siege to Barnard Castle, belonging to Hugh de Balliol, and, approaching too near, Vescy was shot through the head by an arrow.

The original line-up reformed in November 2005, after an eight-year absence, to support Mötley Crüe and Motörhead at the Blackjack festival in Perth. They subsequently played shows around Australia and Japan, and in 2007 Healy was replaced by Pete Speed and Dylan Villain, both on guitar. They released an album, Hellrider on 2010.  History  Fireballs were formed in May 1990 in Melbourne by Eddie Fury on drums and vocals, Matt \\"Black\\" Healy on guitar and Joe Phantom on bass and vocals. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described how their, \\"style based around slap happy rockabilly roots welded to hyperactive speed metal guitar riffs and gravity-defying mohawk haircuts, [they] appealed to metal, punk and Cramps fans alike. The [group] had the distinction of breaking house attendance records at a number of inner-city Melbourne pubs.\\" Their first album, Terminal Haircut, appeared in 1992, it was produced by Bob Witherow for Blistered Finger Records/Shock Records. In June 1994 they issued their second album, Life Takes too Long, on MDS Records. McFarlane observed, \\"the subject matter of the band's songs ran the gamut of fast cars ('Go Go Go'), aliens and horror films ('Spaceman Rock'n'Roll'), sex ('Bondage'), drugs ('Something to Think About') and not much else.\\" They also played at the Big Day Out in 1995. According to The Ages Michael Dwyer, they played up to 400 shows a year and \\"broke enough house attendance records to warrant their own Fire Department file.\\" The Fireballs are the titular subject in a series of three comics by Dillon Naylor from 1996 to 1997. McFarlane reflected, \\"[they] focused on the band's ridiculously hectic lifestyle with plenty of guaranteed laughs.\\" Naylor had also provided graphics for the group since their formation. Their next album, So Bad Its Good (July 1996); McFarlane opined, \\"contained a feast of distorted guitars, bone-rattling percussion and sprinting bass lines.\\" In October 1997 the pace of touring and other pressures caused the band to split. During their tenure they had supported tours by Dick Dale, the Supersuckers, Kiss, The 5.6.7.8's, Porno for Pyros, Midnight Oil and Primus.

Direct Graphics Access is a plug-in for the X display servers that allows client programs direct access to the frame-buffer. Graphics hardware communicates via a chunk of memory called a frame-buffer. This is an array of values that represent pixel color values on the screen. Writing the appropriate values into the frame buffer therefore allows a program to paint areas of the screen. However, as with any shared resource, problems occur when multiple programs attempt to access the same resource, as they tend to write over each other's work. In the X Window System, this is solved by having a central display server that mediates between programs that want to draw on the screen. The display server also used to perform a lot of the drawing work, allowing programs to say Draw me a circle of this radius filled with this pattern or draw this text in this font. The X server does all this work, freeing programmers from having to write their own drawing code. Another advantage of the X architecture is that it works over a network, allowing programs on one machine to display output on the screen of another. Direct Graphics Access allows direct access to the frame-buffer and the X-server hands over control of the frame-buffer to the client program and waits for the client to hand it back. This means that the client program has control of the whole screen, and so it is mostly used for full-screen video/games.

During their decade-long career, they released five studio albums, and toured with many well-established punk rock bands such as Rancid, Anti-Flag, D.O.A., Bouncing Souls, Youth Brigade, and many more. Their music drew comparisons to Jawbreaker, Lifetime, and The Promise Ring, among others.  History  The band formed in 1992, when they were only in grade 8, consisting at the time of Andy Dixon, Jesse Gander, Paul Patko, and Dhani Borges. The first songs they played together were covers of The Ramones (\\"I Believe in Miracles\\") and Stevie Wonder (\\"Higher Ground\\"). They were in grade 11 when they released their first full-length, Tales from the Crib—a pun of Tales from the Crypt, in reference to the band's youth. They went on their first tour that same year, traveling to California with fellow Vancouver punk band Gob.

The 26-story building, designed in a Neo-Renaissance style by Bruce Price with a later expansion by Herman Lee Meader, is tall. It was one of Manhattan's first buildings with steel framing and curtain wall construction, as well as the second tallest building in New York City when completed. The American Surety Building contains a facade of Maine granite. Its articulation consists of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column, namely a base, shaft, and capital, making the American Surety Building one of the earliest New York City skyscrapers to feature such a layout. The facade contains several ornamental features, including sculptural elements designed by J. Massey Rhind. In addition, the American Surety Building utilizes an interior skeleton of structural steel, as well as a cantilevered steel structure for its foundations. The building was erected between 1894 and 1896 as a 21-story structure. Between 1920 and 1922, an annex was built to designs by Meader, increasing the floor area and adding two stories to the building. A later tenant, the Bank of Tokyo, hired Kajima International to restore the lower 13 stories between 1973 and 1975. The American Surety Building was made a New York City designated landmark in 1995.  Site  The American Surety Building is located in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, adjacent to Broadway to the west and Pine Street to the north, with Wall Street less than a block to the south. The building is adjacent to Trinity Church, Trinity's churchyard, and the Trinity and United States Realty Buildings to the west; the Equitable Building to the north; 14 Wall Street to the east; and 1 Wall Street to the south. Entrances to the New York City Subway's Wall Street station, served by the , are adjacent to the building. The lot covers about , and measures on Pine Street and on Broadway. None of the sides are parallel. The original lot, prior to the building's 1920–1922 expansion, measured .  Design  The American Surety Building is 23 stories tall, with a height of . It was designed by Bruce Price in the Neo-Renaissance style. Upon completion, the American Surety Building was 21 stories tall with a height of either . This made it New York City's second tallest building, behind the now- demolished Manhattan Life Insurance Building one block south, which stood at . At the time of the American Surety Building's development in the 1890s, new buildings in New York City were starting to use steel frames, and caisson foundation technology was still relatively new. The American Surety Building was the first New York City skyscraper to use a full steel skeleton. The American Surety Building was also one of the earliest buildings on street corners whose articulation consisted of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column (namely a base, shaft, and capital). The design inspired those of other \\"tower\\" skyscrapers in the United States during the early 20th century. = Facade = The facade consists of Maine granite with a 3-story base, a 12-story shaft, and a 6-story capital, with two transitional stories at the 4th and 15th floors. A two-story penthouse is set back above the 21st floor. The Broadway and Pine Street elevations were both seven bays wide before an expansion in 1920–1922 brought the building to 11 bays on both sides. Price said that he wanted to \\"design a monumental structure\\", and as such he intended the facade to resemble \\"a campanile with four pilaster faces, the seven flutes represented by seven rows of windows\\". The windows on upper stories were originally progressively recessed by per story, so the 20th floor windows were recessed by ; this allowed light to illuminate the upper stories while utilizing entasis for architectural effect. These windows were subsequently replaced with sash windows. Unlike previous buildings such as the Park Row Building, which typically only had one decorated facade, the American Surety Building had all of its facades decorated. Office entrance The main entrance is located on Broadway and consists of a two-story Ionic-style colonnade supporting a seven-bay-wide portico; this portico was five bays wide prior to the expansion. The third-story windows above the portico are flanked by six classical figures designed by J. Massey Rhind, although two more figures were added in the expansion. At the top of the colonnade is an elaborate frieze. The Broadway facade also has an entrance to the upper floors at its southern end. On Pine Street, the lowest two stories are supported by two-story piers above a granite water table, supporting an entablature that wraps around from Broadway. There is a service entrance on the east end of the Pine Street facade, and the third-story windows on this facade have projecting window surrounds with connecting spandrel panels. An entablature runs above the third story on Pine Street and Broadway. The facades of the intermediate stories contain slightly projecting horizontal bands. A band course runs above the fourth story on the Broadway and Pine Street facades. There are sculptures extending across the 14th and 15th stories, connecting the intermediate floors to the transitional 15th story. The top six stories were treated as a \\"cap\\" with Corinthian style pilasters forming a colonnade; a parapet between the 20th and 21st stories with gilded metal; and a large projecting stone cornice atop the 21st floor. The original gilded parapet and the sculptures were removed in the 1920–1922 expansion, and a cornice with anthemia was installed atop the two-story penthouse. The southern elevation of the 20th and 21st floors, from Price's original design, remains partially visible. = Foundation = Contractor Charles Sooysmith designed the foundation, which was a mix of grillage and caissons. Sooysmith was among the first builders to use pneumatic caissons for foundations, having used them in other projects such as the Manhattan Life Insurance Building. The caissons were sunken to stone beds between deep, where the layer of bedrock was situated. Each caisson was tall and made of steel plates. A steel shaft with a cross section of rose from each of the caissons, and was topped by a cylinder of in diameter by tall. The underlying ground was drawn out from the caissons, and then filled with concrete. Thirteen brick piers were subsequently built around the caisson shafts. The building's internal steel structure is cantilevered over the foundation piers due to the presence of other structures nearby when the American Surety Building was erected. The steel structure was designed to be completely separate from the surrounding buildings, and thus party walls could not be used. A steel plate was placed atop the masonry tips of each pier. A grillage of transversely laid I-beams was installed above the plates. Deep plate girders were placed over the grillages, and the cantilevers extended outward from these girders to the edge of the building footprint, where they supported the columns of the superstructure. At the time of the American Surety Building's construction, there was already discussion on building a subway line under Broadway (which would become the Lexington Avenue Line, served by the ), and a building representative said in 1897 that the foundation was designed \\"with a view of withstanding the effect\\" of a subway tunnel. = Features =  Structural features  Depiction of the American Surety Building's construction Thirty-two structural columns were used in the building, which each carry between . The building utilized portal wind bracing, which could sustain winds of at least ; this was demonstrated during January 1896, when the building was subjected to that wind speed with minimal evidence of oscillation. Exposed steel beams were covered with fireproof tile, while the floor arches were made of firebrick. The floors themselves were made of brick arches, concrete and ash aggregate, and steel joints, covered with a marble finish. The northern and western elevations were curtain walls, as were the eastern and southern elevations above the eighth story. Between the first and eighth stories, the eastern and southern walls were load-bearing brick walls. The southern brick wall was thick to prevent fire from spreading to the Schermerhorn Building to the south. At the time of the building's construction, the thickness of a curtain wall was limited to , imposing a force of on the foundation. If the walls had been load-bearing, then they would have needed to be thick, imposing a force of on the foundation. Due to the use of non-load-bearing curtain walls, an additional of usable space was provided in the width of each bay, resulting in a profit of $2,000 per year. Foundation costs were also reduced, although the use of a steel frame canceled out some of the cost savings, since steel was slightly costlier than masonry. The usage of both curtain and bearing walls was not common at the time of the building's construction.  Interior  The American Surety Building had more than 400 rooms upon completion, accessed by six elevators and a spiral staircase. The elevators moved at , which was then considered very rapid. There were two water tanks, one each on the 10th and 21st floors, which had a cumulative capacity of and supplied water to fire hoses on each floor. The 21st floor was used solely as a utility floor. The 10th-floor tank was used to reduce the maximum water pressure in the American Surety Building's pipes. When the building was expanded in 1920, a two-story penthouse was added, with of restaurant space on each floor. The rental space on the 1st through 7th floors was expanded from , and above the 7th floor, the rental space was expanded to . The expanded building had ten elevators clustered on the north side of the building, as well as two staircases at the northwest and southeast corners. The lobby has a black-and-gold coffered ceiling with a baby-centaur frieze. The ground level contains a large open arcade with ceilings. There was previously a banking room at street level, which contained a gold-leaf ceiling supported by four marble pillars. This banking room was removed in a 1970s renovation and replaced with the open arcade. History = Context = alt= During the late 19th century, life insurance firms were some of the first companies to build high-profile skyscrapers. At the time of the American Surety Building's construction, life insurance companies generally had their own buildings for their offices and branch locations, to ensure that they had instilled \\"not only its name but also a favorable impression of its operations\\" in the general public. This had been a trend since 1870, with the completion of the former Equitable Life Building just north of the American Surety site. Many firms in the Financial District were building to the north of Wall Street, the traditional center of commerce in the neighborhood. By 1865, the three-block of stretch of Broadway between Liberty and Wall Streets had seven buildings for banks or insurance companies, one of which included the Continental Insurance Company Building at 100-102 Broadway. Fire insurance companies established buildings on Pine Street as well. The American Surety Company was one of the insurance firms located within the Financial District, having been established in 1881 at 160 Broadway. = Construction and early use = The American Surety Company bought two lots at Broadway and Pine Street in 1893: an L-shaped lot with frontage on both streets, and another lot at the corner. The price of the latter—, equivalent to in —was the largest price ever paid for a Broadway property at the time. The same year, the company announced that it wanted to build a 15-to-20-story headquarters tower, to be built on their lot measuring . The company organized an architectural design competition, in which the contestants were directed to design a building to maximize the amount of space that could be rented, while still being architecturally consistent on the outside. Nine architects entered this competition, including Napoleon LeBrun, George B. Post, Carrère and Hastings, and McKim, Mead & White. A separate competition was held for the decorative figures, which Rhind won. In February 1894, the company announced that Price had been selected to build the headquarters. Price's design called for a relatively simple building with a flat roof, and took inspiration from his previous commission for 280 Broadway. This appealed to the American Surety Company, because the site had supposedly cost $1.435 million and the company planned to spend another $1.25 million on construction. The cost was still relatively high; Price had convinced the American Surety Company that all four facades needed to be decorated because of its high visibility. Price had conceived the building as a tower, which he saw as \\"the only artistic solution to the problem of high design\\". Although the American Surety Building was not entirely freestanding, being abutted by other structures, it had decorated facades on all four sides. Sometime during construction, the building's plans were modified so that it would have a 21st story. Price subsequently stated that he had planned to add a five-story pyramidal roof to his plans, similar to St Mark's Campanile in Venice. Work on the foundations took about forty percent of the total time allocated for the building's construction, and was completed by November 1894. The design for the American Surety Building's cornice, which projected beyond the lot line, led to a lawsuit filed by John Jacob Astor, who owned the Schermerhorn Building immediately to the south and east. When Astor threatened to build a 22-story building in May 1896, shutting off the windows on these sides, the American Surety Company rented the Schermerhorn Building for 99 years at an annual cost of $75,000 (), which would be equivalent to paying 5% of the Schermerhorn Building's $1.5 million valuation each year. The building was completed in 1896 at a cost of $1.75 million (equal to $ million in ), of which 10% had been spent on underground work. The North American Trust Company was one of the building's earlier tenants, having obtained quarters at the American Surety Building by 1898. Another early tenant was the Weather Bureau, which moved from its previous quarters at the Manhattan Life Building and installed a steel pole. As built, there was an air shaft between the American Surety and Schermerhorn buildings; this air shaft led to a fire in 1901 that damaged the Weather Bureau's quarters. = Expansion and later years = The building (center) looking right from Broadway In April 1920, the American Surety Company indicated its intention to acquire the Schermerhorn Building, and revealed plans for a $2.5 million annex (equivalent to $ million in ) to be finished by 1921. The company then bought the Schermerhorn Building outright for $1.5 million, and started work on the annex by May 1920. Herman Lee Meader supervised alterations, while Ernest R. Graham was hired as consulting architect. The work included a new L-shaped annex that widened the building by , the width of four bays, on both Pine Street and Broadway. Meader added a light shaft along the new southern elevation, but retained Price's original facade. The work also involved removing existing flooring and partitions, since the upper floors would have to be wider than the lower floors to align with the original building's walls, which receded gradually on each floor. The entrance portico on Broadway was shifted to the center of the facade; two figures on the 14th and 15th floors were removed; and a two-story penthouse was added. The work was ultimately completed in 1922, although the New York Herald reported in July 1921 that the company had picked a leasing agent for the near-completed annex. During the mid-20th century, one of the larger tenants was the Bank of Tokyo, which first took space in the American Surety Building in 1952 and expanded to the building's banking room and several floors over the next decade. Irving Brodsky bought the building in 1962, just after the American Surety Company merged with Transamerica Corporation. The Thomson Realty Company took ownership of the building in 1973. When the bank's lease expired that year, it decided to sign a long-term lease and concurrently renovate the building. Kajima International was commissioned to refurbish 100 Broadway's lowest thirteen stories, used by the Bank of Tokyo, for $11 million. Kajima also installed new elevators, mechanical systems, and bronze windows, as well as reconfigured the ground- floor banking and commercial spaces into an open arcade. A sculpture by Isamu Noguchi, a aluminum rhomboid weighing , was also placed in the lobby. This renovation was completed by 1975. The Bank of Tokyo removed the Noguchi sculpture in 1980 without telling Noguchi. During the early 1990s, the Bank of Tokyo vacated of space it occupied at 100 Broadway, moving to 1251 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building as a city landmark in 1995. After the September 11 attacks in 2001 led to the collapse of the World Trade Center nearby, Borders Group opened a bookstore in the American Surety Building's base in 2003. The Borders store replaced its destroyed branch in the World Trade Center and was praised as one of several commercial projects that contributed to economic growth in Lower Manhattan after the September 11 attacks. Madison Capital bought 100 Broadway in late 2010, and shortly afterward, the Borders branch closed after Borders Goup filed for bankruptcy. Most of the vacant retail space was ultimately occupied in 2012 by Duane Reade, a pharmacy and convenience store. TD Ameritrade occupied the remaining space in 2013, and the same year, Northwood Investors bought the building for $150 million.  Critical reception  The American Surety Building was erected at a time when buildings usually did not rise higher than 10 or 11 stories, and when skyscrapers were generally criticized. Architecture critic Russell Sturgis praised the ground-floor colonnade as \\"a masterly adaptation of the loveliest forms of antiquity\\" reinforced by the pilasters on Pine Street and Broadway. When Price died in 1903, The Brickbuilder described the American Surety Building as \\"certainly the most interesting tall building in the country\\". Architecture critic Montgomery Schuyler said that the building design was one of the first to use \\"the column analogy\\" that became popular at the beginning of the 20th century. After the 1975 modernization project, critic Ada Louise Huxtable called 100 Broadway \\"one of those sleeper landmarks (undesignated) of which New York has so many more than anyone realizes—an outstandingly fine early skyscraper\\".

It has been in production since 1965, and was the first regular production all stainless steel revolver made. The 1965 model's stainless steel production proved so popular that there was a waiting list at gunshops for up to six months to purchase one.

Townsend wrote under the pen name \\"Gath\\", which was derived by adding an \\"H\\" to his initials, and inspired by the biblical passage II Samuel 1:20, \\"Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askalon.\\" Life and career Townsend was born in Georgetown, Delaware, on January 30, 1841.Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 218. He originally wrote for the Philadelphia Inquirer, and in 1861 he moved to the New York Herald. He is considered to have been the youngest correspondent of the war. In 1865, Townsend was Washington correspondent for the New York World, covering the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and its aftermath. His daily reports filed between April 17 - May 17 were published later in 1865 as a book, The Life, Crime, and Capture of John Wilkes Booth, reprinted in 1977, and published in audio version in 2009. Immediately following the war, he married Elizabeth Evans Rhodes of Philadelphia. By 1868, he had become one of the most quotable Washington correspondents, working for the \\"Chicago Tribune,\\" and, after 1874, for the \\"New York Graphic.\\" His letters, published several times a week, were several columns long, and included lively word-portraits of politicians and opinion. He established and edited, with an Ohio journalist and politician, Donn Piatt, the Capital at Washington, D.C., in 1871, but parted company with Piatt soon after.Johnson, Rossiter and John H. Brown, The Twentieth Century Biographical Dictionary of Notable Americans, Boston, 1904. Townsend (left) photographed with Mark Twain (middle) and David Gray. Townsend's unused mausoleum at Gathland State Park In 1884 Townsend began building a baronial estate in the Catoctin Mountains called \\"Gapland,\\" near Burkittsville, Maryland. Gapland was built on the site of the Battle of Crampton's Gap, and is in close proximity to the battlefields of South Mountain and Antietam. The estate was composed of several buildings, including Gapland Hall, Gapland Lodge, the Den and Library Building, and a mausoleum (notable for its inscription of \\"Good Night Gath\\"). In 1896, Townsend built the War Correspondents' Memorial Arch, the first such monument tribute to war journalists. His novels included The Entailed Hat (1884), which fictionalized a true story of a woman named Patty Cannon who kidnapped free blacks and sold them into slavery. Townsend's other works include the short story collection Tales of the Chesapeake (1880) and the novel Katy of Catoctin (1887). The Gapland estate is now Gathland State Park. Several buildings still stand, including Gapland Hall (which is the park headquarters) and the mausoleum. Townsend left Gapland in 1911, and died three years later in New York City. He was buried in Philadelphia. The site was given to the State of Maryland and in 1949 became Gathland State Park.

It is usually defined as all theropod dinosaurs more closely related to modern birds (Aves) than to deinonychosaurs, though alternative definitions are occasionally used (see below). Archaeopteryx lithographica, from the late Jurassic Period Solnhofen Formation of Germany, is the earliest known avialan which may have had the capability of powered flight. Supplementary info However, several older avialans are known from the late Jurassic Tiaojishan Formation of China, dated to about 160 million years ago.  Definition  Most researchers define Avialae as branch-based clade, though definitions vary. Many authors have used a definition similar to \\"all theropods closer to birds than to Deinonychus.\\"Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; Osmólska, Halszka (eds.) (2004). The Dinosauria, Second Edition. University of California Press., 861 pp. A nearly identical definition, \\"the theropod group that includes all taxa closer to Passer than to Dromaeosaurus\\", was used by Agnolín and Novas (2013) for their clade Averaptora. Additionally, beginning in the late 2000s and early 2010s, several groups of researchers began adding the genus Troodon as an additional specifier in the definition of Avialae. Troodon had long been considered a close relative of the dromaeosaurids in the larger group Deinonychosauria, though some contemporary studies found it and other troodontids more closely related to modern birds, and so it has been specifically excluded from Avialae in more recent studies. Avialae is also occasionally defined as an apomorphy-based clade (that is, one based on physical characteristics). Jacques Gauthier, who named Avialae in 1986, re-defined it in 2001 as all dinosaurs that possessed feathered wings used in flapping flight, and the birds that descended from them.Gauthier, J. (1986). \\"Saurischian monophyly and the origin of birds.\\" In: K. Padian, ed. The origin of birds and the evolution of flight. San Francisco: California, Acad.Sci. pp.1–55. (Mem.Calif.Acad.Sci.8.)Gauthier, J., and de Queiroz, K. (2001). \\"Feathered dinosaurs, flying dinosaurs, crown dinosaurs, and the name Aves.\\" Pp. 7-41 in New perspectives on the origin and early evolution of birds: proceedings of the International Symposium in Honor of John H. Ostrom (J. A. Gauthier and L. F. Gall, eds.). Peabody Museum of Natural History, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, U.S.A. = Differentiation from Aves = Gauthier (page 34) identified four conflicting ways of defining the term \\"Aves\\", which is a problem since the same biological name is being used four different ways. Gauthier proposed a solution, number 4 below, which is to reserve the term Aves only for the crown group, the last common ancestor of all living birds and all of its descendants. He assigned other names to the other groups. # Aves can mean all reptiles closer to birds than to crocodiles (alternatively Avemetatarsalia [=Pan-aves]) # Aves can mean those advanced archosaurs with feathers (alternatively Avifilopluma) # Aves can mean those feathered dinosaurs that can fly (alternately Avialae) # Aves can mean the last common ancestor of all the currently living birds and all of its descendants (a \\"crown group\\"). (alternatively Neornithes) Under the fourth definition Archaeopteryx is an avialan, and not a member of Aves. Gauthier's proposals have been adopted by many researchers in the field of paleontology and bird evolution, though the exact definitions applied have been inconsistent. Avialae, initially proposed to replace the traditional fossil content of Aves, is sometimes used synonymously with the vernacular term \\"bird\\" by these researchers.  Evolution  The earliest known avialan fossils come from the Tiaojishan Formation of China, which has been dated to the late Jurassic period (Oxfordian stage), about 160 million years ago. The avialan species from this time period include Anchiornis huxleyi and Aurornis xui. Xiaotingia zhengi used to be considered a member, but was later classified within the clade Dromaeosauridae. The well-known early avialan, Archaeopteryx, dates from slightly later Jurassic rocks (about 155 million years old) from Germany. Many of these early avialans shared unusual anatomical features that may be ancestral to modern birds, but were later lost during bird evolution. These features include enlarged claws on the second toe which may have been held clear of the ground in life, and long feathers or \\"hind wings\\" covering the hind limbs and feet, which may have been used in aerial maneuvering. Avialans diversified into a wide variety of forms during the Cretaceous Period. Many groups retained primitive characteristics, such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups, including modern birds (Aves). While the earliest forms, such as Archaeopteryx and Jeholornis, retained the long bony tails of their ancestors, the tails of more advanced avialans were shortened with the advent of the pygostyle bone in the group Pygostylia. In the late Cretaceous, around 95 million years ago, the ancestor of all modern birds also evolved a better sense of smell.

At Trelleborg the railway terminates at a railway ferry quay allowing rail cars to be ferried to Sassnitz in Germany. A part of the railway is also part of the line between Malmö and Copenhagen via the Oresund Bridge. The first seven kilometers of the line are double track. Local passenger trains between Malmö and Trelleborg serves the railway with several stops along the route, and uses the old central station building of Trelleborg near the ferry port. The passenger service began to run again in the fall of 2015, after 40 years of non-existence. Transport company Veolia operates a direct sleeper train service between Malmö and Berlin (formerly known as Berlin Night Express), using the ferry. History At first called Malmö-Kontinentens Järnväg, the railway was opened in 1898 and was initially thought of as an extension of Södra Stambanan southwards. The line replaced an old railway between Malmö and Trelleborg, the Malmö–Trelleborg Railway, which didn't have good enough standard for the traffic. The ferry traffic service started in 1909, the same year it was nationalized. It was electrified in 1933. In the 1950s the seven kilometers between Malmö and Lockarp were rebuilt to double track. In 1973 the local passenger train line between Malmö and Trelleborg were shut down, but was reactivated again in 2015. Most of the international trains on the railway were foreign, and until the 1970s there were direct trains from Malmö to Moscow (operated by the Russian Railways), Hamburg (operated by Deutsche Bundesbahn) and Prague.

Photo: John Bortniak, NOAA, January 1979. A halo display observed over the South Pole. Featured in the photo are several distinct phenomena: A parhelic circle (horizontal line), a 22° halo (circle) with two sundogs (bright spots), and an upper tangent arc. Photo: Cindy McFee, NOAA, December 1980. A parhelic circle is a halo, an optical phenomenon appearing as a horizontal white line on the same altitude as the sun, or occasionally the Moon. If complete, it stretches all around the sky, but more commonly it only appears in sections. Even fractions of parhelic circles are less common than sun dogs and 22° halos. While parhelic circles are generally white in colour because they are produced by reflection, they can however show a bluish or greenish tone near the 120° parhelia and be reddish or deep violet along the fringes. (including an excellent HaloSim simulation of a parhelic circle.) Parhelic circles form as beams of sunlight are reflected by vertical or almost vertical hexagonal ice crystals. The reflection can be either external (e.g. without the light passing through the crystal) which contributes to the parhelic circle near the sun, or internal (one or more reflections inside the crystal) which creates much of the circle away from the sun. Because an increasing number of reflections makes refraction asymmetric some colour separation occurs away from the sun. Sun dogs are always aligned to the parhelic circle (but not always to the 22° halo). The intensity distribution of the parhelic circle is largely dominated by 1-3-2 and 1-3-8-2 rays (cf. the nomenclature by W. Tape, i.e. 1 denotes the top hexagonal face, 2 the bottom face, and 3-8 enumerate the side faces in counter-clockwise fashion. A ray is notated by the sequence in which it encounters the prism faces). The former ray-path is responsible for the blue spot halo which occurs at an azimuth. \\\\theta_{\\\\mathfrak{1}\\\\mathfrak{3}\\\\mathfrak{2}}=2\\\\arcsin\\\\left(n\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\arcsin\\\\left(1/n\\\\right)\\\\right)/\\\\cos\\\\left(e\\\\right)\\\\right), with n being the material's index of refraction (not the Bravais index of refraction for inclined rays). However, many more features give a structure to the intensity pattern of the parhelic circle. Among the features of the parhelic circle are the Liljequist parhelia, the 90° parhelia (likely unobservable), the second order 90° parhelia (unobservable), the 22° parhelia and more. Artificial parhelic circles can be realized by experimental means using, for instance, spinning crystals.

It is a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusc. Several vernacular names exist, but it is unclear if they are much in use: brown soil slug, common garden slug, darkface arion, Mabille's orange-soled slug, April slug. Taxonomic background Arion hortensis was described by Férussac in 1819. Only in the 1970s did the amateur malacologist Stella Davies discover that in Britain that name had been applied to three distinct species. Later the name Arion distinctus was used for the one of these species that Davies had provisionally called \\"form A\\". Mabille's original 1868 description of A. distinctus included details (coloration, date of collection) that tended to indicate this species rather than Arion hortensis s.s. No type survived, so a neotype has been designated, collected from the same rough locality (near Sèvres, Paris). Identification As in other members of the genus Arion, the pneumostome is in the anterior half of the mantle. Arion distinctus never gets bigger than about 4 cm extended. In contrast with members of the subgenus Carinarion (e.g. Arion circumscriptus), there is no dorsal line of pale tubercles suggesting a keel and the shape of the body in cross-section is a segment of a circle rather than a bell shape. Arion distinctus lacks the prickly tubercles of A. intermedius, and is larger and darker with prominent lateral bands. Arion subfuscus and A. fuscus can look similar to A. distinctus when preserved, but these species in life have bright orange mucus on the body and a pale sole, whereas in A. distinctus the sole appears yellow or orange from the sole mucus, but the body mucus is not coloured. However, reliable discrimination from other members of the subgenus Kobeltia is not always straightforward on external characters. In much of Western Europe the Kobeltia species most likely to be confused is A. hortensis; mixed populations often occur. Authorities differ in their advice on how reliably the two species can be separated using external characters when alive. Useful indications are that A. distinctus has dark tentacles without the red or violet tinge typical of A. hortensis, the general appearance of its back is yellower or browner than in A. hortensis, the row of tubercles directly above the sole is not as white as is typical of A. hortensis, and (least reliably) the lateral bands tend to be lower, running through the pneumostome rather than above. If dissection reveals a two-partite oviduct, one can be sure of A. distinctus, but in most regions a sizeable proportion of individuals have a three-partite oviduct like that of A. hortensis. The definitive character, distinguishing A. distinctus from all other Kobeltia species, is a conical structure inside the atrium that covers the entrance to the epiphallus, but it is not developed in juveniles. The structure is involved in receiving the partner's spermatophore. Habitat Arion distinctus occurs in a variety of moist habitats, including gardens, waste ground and woodland, but may be absent in harsh upland habitats. In Switzerland it occurs up to 2000 m. It is typically found amongst ground litter or sheltering under wood, stones and soil clods. Studies in agriculture and horticulture have often not distinguished A. distinctus and A. hortensis, but both species are considered to be economically significant pests. Distribution This species is believed native to Western, Northern and Central Europe, but has spread eastwards, particularly in synanthropic habitats. The Andorran occurrences are the only confirmed records from the Iberian Peninsula. * Andorra * Austria * Belgium * Bulgaria * Croatia * Czech Republic * Denmark * Faroe Islands * Finland * France * GermanyDeutsche Namen für einheimische Schnecken und Muscheln * Great Britain * Hungary * Iceland * Ireland * Italy (north only) * Latvia * Lithuania * The Netherlands * Norway (up to 69.6°N) * Poland * Russia (Moscow) * Serbia * Slovakia * Sweden (below 61° N) * Switzerland * Ukraine Arion distinctus has also been introduced beyond Europe. The following include only records in which A. distinctus has explicitly been distinguished from A. hortensis. * Azores * Madeira * South Africa (probable identification) * Canada (British Columbia, Ontario, Nova Scotia) * USA (California, Pennsylvania) * Taiwan * New Zealand Life cycle and reproduction Unfortunately with most relevant studies it is unclear to what extent the authors were dealing with populations of the sibling species A. hortensis or with mixed populations. However, a more recent study of a pure A. distinctus population in southern England reports results comparable with most others (but not with Hunter 1968, so that study might have concerned A. hortensis). The majority of individuals matured in early winter and adults persisted until summer. Eggs laid at the beginning of this period produced animals of adult size already by the start of summer, but these disappeared underground over summer and did not mature reproductively until the end of the year. This is an annual life cycle. The development of slugs hatching from eggs laid later in spring appeared to be delayed by the dry summer conditions, generating a bimodal size distribution in autumn, and these slugs only matured in spring, with possibly some delaying further. Hence, most studies have reported a full range of sizes of this species throughout the year, although reproducing adults are largely absent over summer and autumn. Arion distinctus matures several weeks or more later than the sibling species A. hortensis. In captivity eggs took about 27 days to hatch at 12–15 °C. Genetic evidence implies that A. distinctus is at least predominantly an outbreeder. In captivity it only produced offspring when it had had the company of a conspecific. The two oviduct morphs of A. distinctus mate with each other freely, even though only the tripartite form is able to evert its oviduct over the back of the partner. Coitus lasts 20–30 min, considerably shorter than in A. hortensis. Arion distinctus has been observed mating with A. hortensis in the wild, but no hybrids have been observed.

A prolific actor, he appeared in over 120 films between 1931 and 1982. Early life and career Chinese by ancestry and Hawaiian by birth, Loo spent his youth in Hawaii, then moved to California as a teenager. He graduated from the University of California at Berkeley and began a career in business. However, the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent economic depression forced him to start over. He became involved with amateur, then professional, theater companies and in 1931 made his first film. Like most Asian actors in non-Asian countries, he played primarily small, stereotypical roles, though he rose quickly to familiarity, if not fame, in a number of films. His stern features led him to be a favorite movie villain, and the outbreak of World War II gave him greater prominence in roles as vicious Japanese soldiers in such successful pictures as The Purple Heart (1944) and God Is My Co-Pilot (1945). Loo was most often typecast as the Japanese enemy pilot, spy or interrogator during the Second World War. In the film The Purple Heart he plays a Japanese judges who commits suicide because he cannot break down the American prisoners. According to his daughter, Beverly Jane Loo, he didn't mind being typecast as a villain in these movies as he felt very patriotic about playing those parts. He was also considered an \\"atmosphere\\" player along with Spencer Chan, Willie Fung and Frank Chew. In 1944 he appeared as a Chinese army lieutenant opposite Gregory Peck in The Keys of the Kingdom. He had a rare heroic role as a war-weary Japanese- American soldier in Samuel Fuller's Korean War classic The Steel Helmet (1951), but he spent much of the latter part of his career performing stock roles in films and minor television roles. In 1974, he appeared as the Thai billionaire tycoon Hai Fat in the James Bond film, The Man with the Golden Gun, opposite Roger Moore and Christopher Lee.

It stars Rajpal Yadav and Neha Dubey (Monsoon Wedding). Synopsis On any other night Rajesh would have fallen asleep by now in the cafeteria to sounds of old folk tales on his battered walkman. Today however is the day he’s leaving. He’s decided, he will drive his taxi into the Bombay night, wherever daylight breaks is where he’s going to stop and start anew. Sounds pretty straight forward. If only the eccentric masseur who has appointed himself position of new best friend to our hapless cabby can convince Rajesh that leaving Bombay at 6 AM won’t get him past the city limits, he may actually stand a chance. The crackly old folk tales Rajesh listens to punctuate the narrative, guiding him like an unwritten map as he embarks on this haphazard road trip into the weird and wonderful. A trip that only gets stranger by the arrival of a stowaway hidden under a pile of fruit in the back seat... You can’t get lost if you don’t know where you’re going...

The Six Saint Beasts ; : : He is one of the two fallen angels that broke free from his imprisonment in hell and begins to cause the disappearance of the guardian angels on earth. He has red hair and 2 bands across his forehead. Zeus gave him the ability to heal with his lips, when he became a Saint Beast. He was the leader of the Six Saint Beast and was very close to Genbu no Shin. In terms of his age appearance on Earth, he is 24 years old and is 185 cm tall (6'). ; : : He is one of the two fallen angels that broke free from his imprisonment in hell and begins to cause the disappearance of the guardian angels on earth. Zeus gave him the ability to read minds with his fingertips, when he became a Saint Beast. He is very close to Suzaku no Rey and he has the ability to fly (his wings is pure white in color with a shade of blue) and he was also referred to as the Golden Phoenix. It was revealed in the CD Drama that the tunic on his head hides a tattoo that seals his memory - of being the son of Zeus and Chronos' wife (Chronos was the God before Zeus), not of an angel and only two angels knows this: Judas and Rey. In terms of his age appearance on Earth, he is 23 years old and is 180 cm tall (5'9). ; : : Zeus gave him the Sword of Seiryuu. Seiryuu means Azure Dragon of the East (Spring). Goh is the oldest of the Saint Beasts (the four Saint Beast calls him Anija which means older brother) and tends to be very serious and in charge of the missions given to him by the Goddess (they call her Megami-sama).He has a deep friendship with Gai. Goh's left eye is colored red whereas his right eye is colored blue, has short brunette hair and a pair of black gloves. Wears a blue sleeveless qipao outfit. He took charge and became the leader of the 4 Saint Beast (replacing Judas). In terms of his age appearance on Earth, he is 22 years old and is 185 cm tall (6'). ; : : Shin has an affinity for tortoises and plays the golden harp (or a harp-like instrument). He received the Shield of Genbu from Zeus (which is almost 3/4 his size and looks like the back of a turtle). Genbu is the Black Tortoise of the North (Winter). He is very close to Kirin no Judas and is very calm and quiet. He also has the ability to manipulate time but using such power has its cons. First, he needs a lot of energy and also his life is at risk. He used it once (when Gai and Maya called out to him on his mind for help against the wayward guardian angel)and he was unconscious for 1 whole week. His hair color changes from cyan to teal, long hair tied with a white ribbon (Judas gave it to him reasoning that playing the harp with a long hair must be hard), wears a black qipao (with long sleeves) outfit and white (changed to black at the second OVA) short boots. In terms of his age appearance on Earth, he is 21 years old and is 177 cm tall (5'8). ; : : Zeus gave him the Spear of Suzaku. Suzaku is the Crimson Phoenix of the South (Summer).

He has an affinity for birds of any sort, including chickens. Rey gained the ability to fly after he became an adult angel, his wings red - gold in color. He is very close to Houou no Luca. He is also disgusted at humans because they eat fried chicken which happens to be Gai's favorite food. Very good at cooking. In terms of his age appearance on Earth, he is 20 years old and is 178 cm tall (5'8) ; : : Zeus gave him the Armor of Byakko. Byakko is the White Tiger of the West (Autumn). Long blonde haired with black highlights at the tips, wears a white qipao (with long sleeves), black pants and black colored flat shoes. Tends to be a little childish, inventive (but most of the time his inventions were useless) and full of energy. He has an affinity for felines. He likes to play pranks on Rey (but same as his inventions, it always fails) and is good friends with Maya. Gai has the ability to control and channel the laws of nature. When they descended on Earth, he has this favorite TV show called 'Venom Saint' that shows an animation of their recent encounters (or more like a chibi version of them that is drawn rather differently) and seems like Maya also has taken a liking to it. Also, he liked the concept of 'convenience store' and wishes that Heaven also has one. In terms of his age appearance on Earth, he is 19 years old and is 170 cm tall (5'5 - 5'6 if rounded off). High Ranking Angels ; : : Maya of Wind is the younger brother of Kira. Red haired, he is half human half angel, his mother being the human. He left Heaven with Kira and wanders around Earth in the hopes of finding their mother. He was very upset when Kira told him that they were leaving (especially since Maya wishes to be one of the Saint Beast so that everyone who bullied him - for being half human - will look at him with respect), and needed convincing by Judas who got hurt in the process. He is very close friends with Gai. Maya has the ability to control ghosts. In terms of his age appearance on Earth, he is 17 years old and is 168 cm tall (5'5). ; : : A spy for Judas and Luca. Shiva appears to be rather obsessed with Judas and hates the Saint Beasts, especially Shin. Prior to the ascent to the Holy Summit to choose the Six Saint Beast, Shiva entered the Forest of Darkness and got a demon to attack Shin who nearly succeeded (he managed to poisoned him by inflicting a wound on his left biceps), if weren't for the timely arrival of Judas. Shiva was the 5th candidate to reach the Holy Summit, but due to his encounter with the demon, Zeus (who sees everything with his transparent crystal ball) rejected him the position. ; : : Kira of Shooting Star is a blond haired and likes to bully Ray. He is very bad tempered and cold hearted to everyone but Maya, his younger brother. He left Heaven with Maya and became a Wandering Angel in order to search for his mother. He is especially rude towards Goh. In terms of his age appearance on Earth, he is 18 years old and is 179 cm tall (5'8 - 5'9 if rounded off). ; : : Childhood friend of Goh, he was furious that the half angels Kira and Maya where selected as candidates for the Six Saint Beast and protested greatly. Goh is saddened about this change within Saki since he was not like this before. ; Angel Kariru : : A friend of Saki who tried to calm him down after the result of the Six Saint Beast first elimination round and he is also one of the candidates for the Six Saint Beast but was not chosen by Zeus. Guardian Angels ; : : She is the guardian angel of the White Sands. She is considered very powerful even among the upper class of guardian angels and was offered a chance to become a candidate for a goddess. She instead left for the human world for training. While there she was manipulated and controlled by the two fallen angels and eventually gave her life and power in a withdrawal technique before Goh managed to help her to remember her true self. ; : : Hiro of the Hawk was once the most pure of the angels. He somehow lost his hawk spirit and therefore his ability to fly. He was still able to cope with that fact as long as his master was there beside him. But when he died, it is just to much for him. Depressed and desperate, he allowed Shiva to use him against the Four Saint Beast in order to revive his dead hawk spirit in the sealed Land of the Revival. He was then cursed and set out to harm the Four Saint Beast. His opponent was Rey who managed to defeat him by using the power of the Suzaku. ; : : Guardian angel of Bambi, Gai and Maya were the ones who finds them on a convenience store. Her twin sister, Rio is the exact opposite of her in terms of appearance. She wears a pink school-like dress and her brown hair is tied at the left side. After the incident, they stayed at the Four Saint Beasts mansion but was again taken by Judas and Luca and were sent to Hell. ; Bambi no Rio : Guardian angel of Bambi, Gai and Maya were the ones who finds them on a convenience store. Her twin sister, Mio is the exact opposite of her in terms of appearance. She wears a blue school-like dress and her brown hair is tied at the right side. She was put on a mind control and attacked Maya and Gai when Mio refuses to join her. She later regains back to her true self when Shin used his power to control time and he did so by going back to the time where she is before the abduction outside the convenience store. After the incident, they stayed at the Four Saint Beasts mansion but was again taken by Judas and Luca and were sent to Hell. ; Kame no Ayumi : One of the guardian angels who visited the Four Saint Beasts before the Full Moon Festival. She and her 2 sisters' master is a newbie veterinarian whose apartment is too small for them so upon seeing the mansion in which the Four Saint Beasts is living in, they were amazed. She has feelings for Shin but Shin's feelings for her is not clear. Shiva used her to get close to Shin so that he can kill him. Kira and Maya finds her at the park and found the awful truth about Judas. She wears a green beret and a matching green dress and skirt. She also has glasses were she explain that she feels she is more close to Shin since Shin is also wearing glasses. ; Tamami : One of the guardian angels who visited the Four Saint Beasts before the Full Moon Festival. She and her 2 sisters' master is a newbie veterinarian whose apartment is too small for them so upon seeing the mansion in which the Four Saint Beasts is living in, they were amazed. She is childish like Gai. ; Tsubasa : One of the guardian angels who visited the Four Saint Beasts before the Full Moon Festival. She and her 2 sisters' master is a newbie veterinarian whose apartment is too small for them so upon seeing the mansion in which the Four Saint Beasts is living in, they were amazed. She always bugs Ray especially when he is cooking and she ends up making trouble for him. ; : Pinky is the messenger of sorts for the Goddess and tends to follow her everywhere. As suggested by her name, she has a pink hair and pink dress that seems to be the uniform for female angels. High Angels ; High Angel Gabriel : : First appearance would be in Judas' dream where they were young angels (all Six Saint Beasts members) and that the two of them (Lucifer and Gabriel) appeared. He also tempts Goh in helping them fight God but same thing with Judas, Goh refused. ; : : One of the High-ranking angels that the Six Saint Beasts look up to, especially Judas. First appearance would be in Judas' dream where they were young angels and that the two of them (Lucifer and Gabriel) appeared. For some reason he is against Zeus and is tempting Judas to do the same thing and join him but Judas refuses to do so. Gods ; : : The God Creator of all, has long gray hair that is tied on the back and a golden staff. He was reincarnated from the human Goro Mutsumi. Zeus initiated a new system within Heaven that ranks angels according to their ability: High-, Middle- and Low-ranking angels that caused disturbance among them. This new system made Judas uneasy because the previously kind-hearted angels now treat each other as if they are competing for a higher rank. Middle-ranked angels were envious of the higher-ranked angels and looked down on the low-ranking angels, whereas the low-ranking angels were envious of the middle-ranked angels and therefore will do anything to be promoted. Also has an attitude that once an angel committed a sin, should never be forgiven and therefore were sent to purged - which means the sinners will be turned into monsters and thrown to Forest of Darkness and each year, the number of angels who were purged increases. And when those monsters escaped the forest, he sealed them within a box called the Case of Hope. But later, when he found out that humans were increasing in number and atrocities as well, he ordered Pandora to released the contents of the box in the human world. In the past he stole the powers of the Saint Beast and sealed them away using his own life to prevent a war. ; The Goddess : : The Goddess is the boss of the Saint Beasts and is the one who sent them to Earth to discover what is happening with the missing guardian angels. She is previously known as Yuki of the Snake, one of the Guardian Angels. She is still close to Seiryuu no Goh, as he is her betrothed one. Others ; : : First met by Maya and Kira as they wander the Earth in search of their mother. Maya was sort of attached to him since he reminds him of Judas in sternness and kindness. Does not follow Zeus order of migrating to a different place since he consider their current residence the 'holy ground'. ; : ; ; : : Short, blond haired, and is one of Zeus' most trusted official, he is unhappy about the Six Saint Beast living in the Zeus' villa since he is afraid that they might steal Zeus' attention and affection away from him, thus his position is in peril. Judas assured him that that is not the case and Pandora denies feeling so. ; : : Like Pandora, an official to Zeus and shares his passion of hating the Six Saint Beasts.

It transferred to the command of the Honourable East India Company in 1668 and to the command of the British Army in 1862. Under the Childers Reforms it amalgamated with the 102nd Regiment of Foot (Royal Madras Fusiliers) to form the Royal Dublin Fusiliers in 1881. History Sir William Wyllie, colonel of the regiment in the 1870s =Formation= Lord Clive meeting with Mir Jafar after the Battle of Plassey, oil on canvas (Francis Hayman, c.1762 The regiment was originally raised in England as independent companies of European soldiers to garrison Bombay in February 1662. It embarked for India later that year and was transferred to the Honourable East India Company as The Bombay Regiment in March 1668. In 1688 it was renamed The Bombay (European) Regiment – \\"European\\" indicating it was composed of white soldiers, not Indian sepoys. The regiment saw action at the Battle of Plassey in June 1757 during the Seven Years' War. It also fought at the Battle of Buxar in October 1764 during the Oude Campaign. It next saw action at the Siege of Seringapatam in February 1792 during the Third Anglo-Mysore War. It fought at the Battle of Seedaseer in March 1799 and the Siege of Seringapatam in April 1799 during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War. =Early nineteenth century= The regiment fought at the Battle of Khadki in November 1817 during the Third Anglo-Maratha War.Sumner, p. 5, 26–28 It then embarked for the Arabian Peninsula in October 1820 and saw action in operations against Omani pirates at Jalan Bani Bu Ali in March 1821. =The Victorian era= The regiment took part in the Conquest of Aden in 1839 and was then renumbered as the 1st Bombay (European) Regiment later in the year (on the creation of the 2nd Bombay (European) Regiment), and designated the 1st Bombay (European) Fusiliers in 1844. It took part in the Siege of Multan in April 1848 and the Battle of Gujrat in February 1849 during the Second Anglo-Sikh War. It also fought at various skirmishes during the Indian Rebellion. After the Crown took control of the Presidency armies in the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion, the regiment became the 1st Bombay Fusiliers in November 1859 and then the 1st Royal Bombay Fusiliers in May 1861. It was then renumbered as the 103rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Bombay Fusiliers) on transfer to the British Army in September 1862. The regiment arrived in England in February 1871. As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 103rd was linked with the 102nd Regiment of Foot (Royal Madras Fusiliers), and assigned to district no. 66 at Naas Barracks in County Kildare. On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 102nd Regiment of Foot (Royal Madras Fusiliers) to form the Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Battle honours The regiment received the following battle honours granted by the Honourable East India Company: Distinctions In 1844 the regiment was granted a number of honorary distinctions recording its past service. The awards were made by the Governor- General of India on 6 November 1844 in the following terms: \\"With the approval of the Right Honourable the Governor-General of India in Council, the Honourable the Governor in Council is pleased to direct, that the honorary distinctions specified below be borne upon the Colours and appointments of the 1st Bombay European Regiment, Fusiliers\\":Mainwaring (1911), p. 376 *The Royal Tiger, superscribed Plassey and Buxar, for services in the Presidency of Bengal, during 1757 and 1764-1765, especially at the battles of Plassey and Buxar and the sieges of Chandernagore, Chunar, and Allahabad. *The Elephant superscribed Carnatic and Mysore, for services on the Coromandel Coast, in the Carnatic and Mysore, during the years 1747-8-9; 1754-5, 1760, 1764 and 1788, especially as having shared in the defence of Cuddalore (Fort St David), 16 June 1748, the operations under Admiral Boscawen, and the siege of Davi Cottah, the latter part of this and the beginning of the following year; the action with the French Army under Monsieur Maisin, between the Sugar Loaf and French Rocks on 16 August 1754, the sieges of Pondicherry and Mihie 1760-1; the sieges of Madura and Palamcottah in 1764; the storming of the Bednore Ghauts and Capture of Bednore in 1783, and the expedition in the first campaign against Seringapatam in 1790-1-2. * Guzerat for service at several different periods; especially throughout the whole of General Goddard's Campaign, with the Bengal Brigade in 1780, and the storming of Ahmedabad, 15 January 1780.

Known in Indonesia/Malaysia as kain kafan, the shroud is the prescribed length of cloth used in Muslim burials to wrap the body of the dead person. The dead body is covered in white fabric tied over the head, under the feet, and on the neck. According to traditional beliefs, the soul of a dead person will stay on the Earth for 40 days after the death. If the ties over the shroud are not released after 40 days, the body is said to jump out from the grave to warn people that the soul needs to be released. After the ties are released, the soul will leave the Earth forever. Appearance There are many variations about pocong appearances, but usually people describe pocong with a pale face and wide open eyes. Another variant consists of burned face pocong with glowing red eye, green face pocong with blank white eye, and flat faced pocong with a hole in their eyes area. Although in popular culture pocong hop like rabbits due to the tie under their feet rendering the ghost unable to walk, the original pocong move by floating above ground. This condition is often used to identify fake pocong. The most favorite place of pocong is under a banana tree. Famous story In some areas in Indonesia there are some pocong variants that developed from social beliefs. One of them is plastic pocongCS, Trio Hantu: Hantupedia, Ensiklopedia hantu-hantu Nusantara, \\"Pocong Plastik\\", Halaman 79, penerbit mediakita, 2016 that haunt Jakarta. Plastic pocong is based on the story of a pregnant woman killed by her boyfriend. During the autopsy, blood kept flowing from the pregnant woman's remains. This situation made the hospital crew decide to cover the remains with plastic before burial. People believed plastic pocong appeared because the woman wanted people to release ties over the plastic cover. In 2007–2008, the andong pocong story surfaced in Sidoarjo, where the ghost appeared as pocong riding a ghost horse-cart. The horse bell sound will be echoed before the appearance of andong pocong. The ghost often knocks on the door in middle of the night, and people who open the door when andong pocong knock will die by a mysterious illness. The andong pocong story originated from a bride that was killed during an incident while riding a horse cart, but some people also linked andong pocong with a black magic user. Pocong Merah or Red Pocong is the most feared pocong variant because of its violent nature. The red color in this pocong is linked with anger and vengeance that is created the moment before the human died. Red pocong often appear attacking humans. Because of its violent and strong nature many people believe red pocong is the king of pocong. Popular culture Pocongs often appear in religion-based movies or TV serials. In the early 2000s (decade), TV stations in Indonesia purported to capture ghost appearances with their cameras and put the records on a specific show of their own. In these shows, the Pocong appearances could be seen very often, along with the kuntilanak. There was also a movie Pocong (2006) directed by Rudy Soedjarwo, which was banned and censored in its French and German DVD versions due to the disturbing, scary, and terrifying scenes. Not long after it was banned, the director created a sequel, less horrible but about the same story, Pocong 2 (2006). Other titles such as Pocong 3 (2007), The Real Pocong (2009), and 40 Hari Bangkitnya Pocong (2008) were introduced in the movie series in theaters in Indonesia. The movie Pocong Jumat Kliwon, directed by successful director Nayato Fio Nuala, began a trend of horror comedy Pocong movies. In 2011 Pocong is also Pocong, a new horror-comedy featuring Pocong, was made by female director Chiska Doppert, Nayato's former partner. Other recent movies featuring Pocong are Sumpah, (Ini) Pocong! (2009), Pocong Setan Jompo (2009) and Kepergok Pocong (2011). These films generally share the quality of the pocong playing a role similar to that of the Grim Reaper, in both comedic and dramatic situations.

(DC.), is a 17-volume treatise on botany initiated by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle. De Candolle intended it as a summary of all known seed plants, encompassing taxonomy, ecology, evolution and biogeography. He authored seven volumes between 1824 and 1839, but died in 1841. His son, Alphonse de Candolle, then took up the work, editing a further ten volumes, with contributions from a range of authors. Volume 17 was published in October 1873. The fourth and final part of the index came out in 1874. The Prodromus remained incomplete, dealing only with dicotyledons. In the Prodromus, De Candolle further developed his concept of families. Note that this system was published well before there were internationally accepted rules for botanical nomenclature. Here, a family is indicated as \\"ordo\\". Terminations for families were not what they are now. Neither of these phenomena is a problem from a nomenclatural perspective, the present day ICN provides for this.

She survived a cyclone at Calcutta in 1864, and was sold to German owners in 1882. In 1887 or 1888 she foundered off Den Helder on the Dutch coast. The storm and sinking In December 1887, http://friesscheepvaartmuseum.nl/beeld/fsm- col2-dat20020266 the Renown sank during a storm in the North Sea off Den Helder in the Netherlands. The survivors climbed up the mizzen-mast and were eventually rescued by a small lifeboat that approached the sinking ship. The lifeboat, captained by Dorus Rijkers, approached Renown, and Rijkers jumped out of the boat and climbed the mast. He and his crew helped the endangered men from the mast to the lifeboat, and brought them to dry land. Of the ship's total crew of 30, approximately five died in the shipwreck and the remainder were rescued between 9 and 11 December. Aftermath The heroic rescue ended successfully, and Dorus Rijkers was later awarded with a gold medal for valour. All of the surviving crew members received a small stipend from the court of The Hague after it was decided that they earned it because Renown was in bad condition when she left the harbor at Hamburg, Germany, one week before the accident.

He was elected as a Democrat to the Forty- third Congress (March 4, 1873 – March 3, 1875) but declined a renomination in 1874 to the Forty-fourth Congress. After leaving Congress, he was president of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company from 1875 to 1879. In addition, he engaged in banking and agricultural pursuits. He died in Louisville, Kentucky in 1887 and was buried in Cave Hill Cemetery. Louisville's largest airport was originally named Standiford Field before being changed to Louisville International Airport in 1995. The airport today still retains the airport code of SDF.

While at Rider, he played four seasons on the men's soccer team. He holds the college record for most goals in a season (18) and career (46). In 1997, Rider University inducted Smith into its Hall of Fame.Rider Hall of Fame Professional The Philadelphia Atoms, a North American Soccer League (NASL) expansion franchise, drafted Smith in the second round of the 1973 College Draft. That year, Smith took home second team All Star honors as the Atoms ran to the NASL championship title. They set a record that season for allowing only 14 goals. Smith returned each of the next two seasons, but the Atoms were unable to replicate their first year success. Smith, on the other hand, continued to be recognized as one of the league's top defenders. In 1974, he was an All Star honorable mention (third team) and in 1975, he became the first native born U.S. player in the NASL to earn first team All Star recognition. Part of the reason for his success in 1975 came from a loan spell with League of Ireland First Division club, Dundalk during the 1974-1975 NASL off season.Philadelphia Atoms History In 1976, the Atoms sold Smith, and team mate Bob Rigby, to the New York Cosmos for $100,000. The move came as part of the condition put on the Cosmos when they signed Pelé. Pelé insisted the Cosmos surround him with good supporting team mates and the Cosmos went shopping. Smith spent three seasons with the Cosmos, winning two more NASL championships with them and earning second team All Star honors in 1976. However, by his third season with the team, the influx of big name international players saw Smith's playing time drop to an all-time low of nine games. At the end of the 1978 season, the Cosmos sent Smith to the San Diego Sockers. In 1979, he was named an honorable mention All Star, his fifth time on an All Star list. However, at the end of the season, the Sockers sent him to the Philadelphia Fury for the 1980 season. The Atoms had folded while Smith was with the Cosmos and the Fury was a new expansion franchise in Philadelphia. Smith spent only one season with the Fury, but his time with the team led to his also playing for the Philadelphia Fever of Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) during the 1980-1981 indoor season. The Fever had already played a season, but coach George O'Neill—hoping to draw on seasoned pros the way defending champions New York Arrows had—remade the team with NASL veterans and drew on several Fury players, including Smith and teammate Bob Rigby. Despite the presence of Smith and other Fury players, the Fever performed poorly and soon vanished from the American soccer scene. Smith then moved to the Montreal Manic of one last season in the NASL. He retired at the end of 1981 season. National team Smith earned 18 caps with the U.S. national team.Soccer Hall of Fame: Player Registry His first appearance came in an August 12, 1973 victory over Poland. Smith became a regular on the team, seeing time in the rest of the U.S. games that year, as well as all of its games in 1974 and half the 1975 games.

In Japan, the show was a cult late-night series where young businessmen and women would ask for money from five rich individuals. However, the 'Dragons' in Japan usually handed over money as a gift and rarely took an equity position in the companies of those asking for money. The Japanese show was created when Nippon TV asked in-house producers to come up with low-budget ideas. The clever twist of asking the 'Dragons' to invest their own money in fledgling businesses kept costs low. The series was filmed in an office at Nippon TV headquarters for the same reason. The UK pilot and first series were filmed at a warehouse space in North London. The original 'Dragons' were Duncan Bannatyne, Doug Richard, Peter Jones, Rachel Elnaugh and Simon Woodroffe. Initially, a one-hour pilot was made which was commissioned by BBC2 as a six-part series. Smith was credited as 'Series Editor' on the original series and also directed the series.

Landing Ground Novar, then RNAS Evanton and later as RAF Evanton, is a disused airfield in Ross and Cromarty, Scotland. It lies on the shore of the Cromarty Firth near the village of Evanton. In the 1934 edition of the loose-leaf publication 'The Air Pilot' (3rd edition) published by The Air Ministry the field is designated as 'R.A.F. Landing Ground (Seasonal) Novar'. The name Novar was later changed to Evanton. History An airfield was established on the site in 1922 to support the Royal Navy's Home Fleet, which had one of its main bases nearby at Invergordon. (Before arriving in port, aircraft carriers must fly off their aircraft to a land base: it is difficult or impossible for fixed wing aircraft to operate from a carrier while the ship is at anchor.) Originally, the navy used a site at Delny, near Invergordon, but it could not be enlarged for larger planes. At first, the airfield was known as the Novar base, after the Novar estate which owned the land. At the time naval aviation was in the hands of \\"The Fleet Air Arm of the RAF\\" and HMS Fieldfare was serviced from RAF Leuchars. The dimensions of the'landing area' (1934 'The Air Pilot') were given as N-S 600 yards, NE-SW 700 yards, E-W 700 yards, SE-NW 500 yards. It was 20 ft (6 metres) asl, and grass covered. Six nearby radio masts were dismantled during the period Oct-April. Cattle were grazed on the landing area from approximately 15 June-25 August.The Air Pilot, 1934. In 1937 it was decided to expand the aerodrome and it became a flight and bombing training school. By the start of the Second World War the Home Fleet had moved to Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands to be out of range of German Bombers. On Empire Day 1939 78 RAF stations were opened to the public. RAF Evanton was the farthest north and attracted a mile long queue of cars and 9,000 visitors. The airfield was shared by the RAF, to whom it was known as RAF Evanton. During the War it was used principally as a training base, particularly for the training of air gunners. By 1943 it was being used for Coastal Command maintenance and it later became storage yard with up to 250 aircraft. The Cromarty Firth was used as a seaplane base during the War and the RAF maintained a presence in Alness until at least the 1980s. RAF Evanton theoretically closed in 1947, but was used for secret flights in the 1950s. =Units= Current use Today the site is large industrial estate with many of the hangars and buildings still in use today, parts of the X shaped runways can still be seen.

It was produced by Hal Roach and directed by Fred Newmeyer. The story was by Jean Havez, Hal Roach, and Sam Taylor. The film was released on November 26, 1922. Grossing $1,275,423, Dr. Jack was one of the top-ten most profitable releases of 1922. Plot As described in a film magazine, young Dr. Jackson (Lloyd), or Dr. Jack, has plenty of practice but scant fees. He believes in using sunshine methods and avoids medicine as far as possible. This is quite contrary to the methods employed by the renowned Dr. Ludwig von Saulsbourg (Mayne), who for four years has reaped a golden harvest out of the father (Prince) of the Sick-Little-Well-Girl (Davis), keeping the latter in dark rooms and feeding her drugs without end. The family lawyer Jamison (Hammond) introduces Dr. Jack as a consultant and things begin to happen. Dr. Jack has met the Girl once accidentally, and is overjoyed when he is called to prescribe for her, a proceeding that results in both falling in love. Caught kissing the Girl, Dr. Jack falls into disgrace and is told that he must leave the next morning. In the meantime, news that a dangerous lunatic has escaped and has been seen in the vicinity of the house reaches its inmates. Dr. Jack, who holds that a little excitement is all the patient needs to make her perfectly normal, arranges a night alarm for the occupants of the home. He dons a wig and hat and, thus disguised, makes unexpected appearances in various parts of the establishment, throwing everybody into spasms of momentary terror. In the long run he reveals himself to the Girl, her father realizes that she is cured, von Saulsbourg is required to make an undignified exit, and the two lovers are happy.  Background  Dr. Jack is an upbeat gag-driven film, played solely for laughs. Released between the sensitive, complex character comedy of Grandma's Boy and the daredevil \\"thrill picture\\" Safety Last!, it was Lloyd's first intentional five-reeler, whereas his two previous features, A Sailor-Made Man and Grandma's Boy, both grew from two- reelers to five-reelers during the actual shooting.

It is located in Vågå Municipality in Innlandet county, Norway. This is the highest lake that has been investigated as a climate archive in southern Norway, being situated at above sea level. A small glacier, Bukkehåmmårbreen, is draining meltwater into the lake at present. This glacier reformed just short of 6,000 years ago following the Holocene climate optimum and has existed continuously since. After growing gradually towards 4,000 years before present (BP) the glacier has been of near present size over the last 4,000 years, growing slightly larger over the last 2-2,500 years.Lie et al. (2004): Quaternary Science Reviews 23 1925–1945 Prior to the climate optimum and following the deglaciation the glacier melted some 10,000 years before present. The flat valley-shoulder that the lake is eroded into is locally known as a \\"fly\\". This particular level at about 1600 m a.s.l. and is believed to have been formed between 100 and 85 million years ago during the Cretaceous period. Standing on the shore-line of Bukkehåmmårtjørna thus means that you are standing on the remnants of a landscape that the Dinosaurs ruled. The small lake existed prior to the Last Glacial Maximum since it contains organic material older than 30,000 years old.Lie and Sandvold (1997): unpublished master thesis) Currently being reassessed, growing evidence now indicates that much of the landscape that can be seen from this site is practically unchanged since the age of the Mammoth who lived on the wide plateaus more than 40,000 years ago. The view from the lake, or higher up on the mountain-peak Høgdebrotet therefore includes a view into the landscapes of the distant past, including the landscape of the dinosaurs, the pre-ice age landscape, the landscape of the Mammoth during the last glacial period. By squinting your eyes and imagining the present forest-limit below, located some 300 m higher than at present and by imagining the glaciers of Leirungsalpene being absent you can also see the landscape as it was 7,000 years ago.

It was developed some time before 1825, and became one of the first slave spirituals to be widely sung by white Christians. A number of artists have recorded notable versions of it, and it was used as one of the main themes in the critically praised documentary The Civil War. About the song African American slaves in the United States created a vibrant culture of resistance and dissent, despite attempts by white slaveowners to indoctrinate them into passivity using a variant of Christianity. Slaves were not permitted to speak while working in the fields, but were permitted to sing and chant in order to alleviate tedium and to impose a rhythm on repetitive motions. This generated two distinctive African American slave musical forms, the spiritual (sung music usually telling a story) and the field holler (sung or chanted music usually involving repetition of the leader's line). We Are Climbing Jacob's Ladder is a spiritual. As a folk song originating in a repressed culture, the song's origins are lost. Some academics believe it emerged as early as 1750, and definitely no later than 1825, and was composed by American slaves taken from the area now known as Liberia. The spiritual utilizes the image of Jacob's ladder, and equates it with the body of Christ (in ways quite similar to the teachings of Catherine of Siena). The song is in the form of call and response, and although lyrics vary from place to place and over time, they generally emphasize spiritual growth, increasing one's knowledge about God, and a call to discipleship. The striving nature of this \\"climb\\" toward God is depicted as a series of tests, and draws heavily on the New Testament tradition of the Christian as warrior—in this case, overcoming the slave- owner. The traditional lyrics hold out hope that the slave can rise up and escape slavery, and the nature of the call-and-response asks both the singing respondents and the listener for greater sacrifice to reach the next level. The spiritual implies that God's promise to the Biblical patriarch Jacob will also lead the slave to freedom. The song became one of the first African American spirituals to become popular among white Christians. Important recordings Paul Robeson sang and later recorded an a cappella version, and the American labor movement used the song in the 1930s (sometimes altering the lyrics to reflect the industry being organized). Noted American folk singer Pete Seeger began singing the song some time in the 1930s or 1940s, and in the mid to late 1960s added a new verse (\\"We are dancing Sarah's circle\\") to reflect, as he saw it, a more feminist, less hierarchical, less restrictive, and more joyful meaning. These lyrics were publicly sung at least as early as 1969. Completely revised feminist lyrics were copyrighted in 1975 by Carole Etzler. Folk singer Arlo Guthrie recorded Seeger's version in 1996, with Seeger assisting with music and vocals, for Guthrie's two-record set, More Together Again. In 2006, rock musician Bruce Springsteen recorded Seeger's version of Jacob's Ladder for his album We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions. Dr. Bernice Johnson Reagon recorded an a cappella version of the song for her 1987 album River of Life: Harmony One (Flying Fish Records). It was later included on the soundtrack of the 1991 multipart documentary The Civil War, which was directed by Ken Burns. Jimmy Wolfe, host on WGTB radio in Washington, D.C., called Reagon's recording \\"a gem\\". Lyrics We Are Climbing Jacob's Ladder is sung as a call-and-response. The first two lines (\\"We are / climbing\\") are call-and-response, while the third line (\\"Jacob's ladder\\") is sung together. The first three lines are repeated, followed by a new call-and-response seventh line (\\"Soldier\\"), and then an eighth line (\\"of the cross\\") sung together.

Then, van Eijden joined PSV Eindhoven youth system in 1999, where he started his career there and after progressing through the ranks, he was promoted to Jong PSV Eindhoven in September 2004. On 11 April 2007, van Eijden was called up to the senior team for the first time by then Manager Ronald Koeman and he made his debut for PSV Eindhoven in the UEFA Champions League-match against Liverpool. Van Eijden came on as a substitute in the 72nd minute for the Ivorian striker, Arouna Koné. After the match, van Eijden reflected on his PSV Eindhoven debut, admitting he didn't expect it. This turns out to be his only appearance for the side, as he spent his PSV Eindhoven in the reserves. In February 2008, van Eijden was officially promoted to the PSV Eindhoven and began training with the side. In April 2008, van Eijden signed a contract with the club, keeping him until 2011. =Willem II (loan)= In the summer of 2008, he left PSV on loan, to play for Willem II for the rest of the season,PSV stalt Rens van Eijden bij Willem II - Omroep Brabant which also obtained a transfer right option. Upon joining Willem II, van Eijden believed the move would benefited him, stating it would be good for developing his career.

However, despite suffering from injury during the season and subsequently placed on the substitute bench for the rest of the season, van Eijden finished his first season at NEC Nijmegen, making the total of 27 appearances and scoring once. Reflecting to his first season, van Eijden cited his poor performance on his personal problems. In the 2010–11 season, van Eijden started the season well when he set up a goal for Ramon Zomer, who scored the only goal in the game, in a 1–0 win over VVV-Venlo. However, van Eijden found himself out of the first team, due to sidelined over injuries and being on the substitute bench. Despite this, he went to make the total of 15 appearances in all competitions. In his first two seasons at NEC, van Eijden faced criticism from the club's supporters, due to his poor performance. In the 2011–12 season, van Eijden began to established himself in the starting eleven in the defence (and continued to remain in the starting eleven for the next four seasons until his departure). and started every matches despite his briefly injury. During a 1–0 win over Feyenoord on 5 November 2011, van Eijden was punched by Guyon Fernandez after Fernandez accused van Eijden of racism, serving a six match ban for assault. As a result, van Eijden was cleared of racism and the Dutch FA did not took action against him. van Eijden, himself, denied claims that he racially abused Fernandez. It wasn't until on 19 February 2012 when he scored his first goal of the season, in a 4–1 loss against Ajax. After briefly sidelined over suspension and injuries on four occasions, van Eijden made the total of 31 appearances and scoring once in all competitions. At the end of the 2011–12 season, that saw N.E.C. unsuccessfully won a UEFA Europa League spot, van Eijden was awarded Player of the Season and signed a contract extension with the club, keeping him until 2016. In the 2012–13 season, van Eijden continued to be in the first team and started the season when he played 90 minutes and kept a clean sheet, in a 2–0 win over Heerenveen in the first match of the season. He then scored his first goal of the season on 27 January 2013, in a 2–1 win over FC Groningen. Although he was booked three times during the season, van Eijden played every singles matches this season, making the total of 35 appearances.

In the 2013–14 season, van Eijden was captain for the side in absence of Ryan Koolwijk and played his first match as captain in the opening game of the season, which saw N.E.C. lose 4–1 to Groningen. Following the match, he accepted his responsibilities over the loss. He continued to remain his first team place in the back four since the start of the season. He then scored his first goal for the club on 20 October 2013, in a 1–1 draw against Heracles Almelo.

At the end of the 2013–14 season, van Eijden made a total of 36 appearances and scoring 3 times in all competitions. Ahead of the 2014–15 season, van Eijden's future at N.E.C. Nijmegen was uncertain following the club's relegation from Eredivisie. By the end of the summer transfer window, he managed to stay at the club. At the start of the season, van Eijden was given the captaincy by Manager Ruud Brood and continued to established himself in the back four defence. Under his leadership, van Eijden helped the go on an unbeaten run between 29 August 2014 and 16 January 2015 with 13 wins and then another unbeaten run between 23 January 2015 and 1 May 2015 with 17 wins. He then scored his first goal of the season on 24 November 2014, in a 1–1 draw against Jong Ajax. After missing out one game over sickness, van Eijden scored twice on 20 March 2015, in a 4–1 win over MVV Maastricht. His performance against MVV Maastricht earned him Player of the Week. The club confirmed their promotion to Eredivisie after beating Sparta Rotterdam 1–0 on 3 April 2015. After helping the side promotion to the Eredivisie, van Eijden made a total of 40 appearances and scoring 3 times in all competitions for the 2014–15 season. In the 2015–16 season, van Eijden continued to remain the club's captain for the side at the start of the season. He also did well when he set up a goal for Navarone Foor, in a 1–0 win over Willem II on 28 August 2015. His leadership in the first half of the season led the side to make a great start back in the league despite the changes of selection made. However, in December 2015, it was hinted that van Eijden may leave the club over his high wages. The following month, N.E.C. Nijmegen made an agreement with Dynamo Moscow to sign van Eijden. It came after when Dynamo Moscow had their bid rejected by N.E.C. Nijmegen in their first attempt before accepting for the second one and his desire to leave the club. This led a strained relationship between van Eijden and the club's director of football Bart van Ingen. However, the move was broken down after the after the negotiations over a change of heart moving to Dynamo Moscow on two occasions.Transfer van de baan: Rens van Eijden voelt zich 'genaaid' door Dinamo Moskou - Omroep Brabant While on the negotiations, van Eiljden found himself losing his captaincy to Brad Jones in his absent. So after all these happening, he stayed at NEC for the rest of the season and returned to the selection, leading him to return his duties as captain for the rest of the season. In his last home appearance in a 2–1 loss against Roda JC on 2 May 2016, he was given bouquet and pictures as part of the farewell gift. Despite being suspended twice and suffered an injury later in the season, van Eijden finished the 2015–16 season, making the total of 28 appearances in all competitions. =AZ Alkmaar= van Eijden training ahead of a UEFA Europa League match against Olympique Lyonnais. It was announced on 4 April 2016 that AZ Alkmaar and N.E.C. Nijmegen made an agreement to sign van Eijden. The move was confirmed on 8 April 2016, where he joined the side in the summer of 2016 on a four–year contract. It came after when van Eijden would be leaving the club at the end of the 2015–16 season. Upon joining the club, van Eijden was given a number three shirt ahead of the new season. Zenit Saint Petersburg. Although he briefly breaking his nose in the pre–season friendly match against Hertha BSC, van Eijden made his AZ debut in a third round second leg of the UEFA Europa League against PAS Giannina, in a 2–0 win to send them through to the next round. Three days later, on 7 August 2017, he made his league debut for the side, where he set up one of the goals, in a 2–2 draw against SC Heerenveen. Since making his debut, van Eijden established in the centre–back position with Ron Vlaar, a comment he said was his reason moving to AZ. Following Vlaar's injury, van Eijden captained the side for the first time, in a 1–1 draw against Sparta Rotterdam. However, he suffered a groin injury that kept him out throughout 2016. After returning to the reserve side from injury, van Eijden returned to the side from injury, as well as, captain, in a 2–1 loss against Vitesse on 29 January 2017. However, in a 3–2 win over Cambuur in the semi–finals of the KNVB Cup on 2 March 2017, he was sent–off in extra time for a professional foul. After serving a three match ban, van Eijden, nevertheless, started and played in the final of the KNVB Cup against Vitesse, which AZ lost 2–0. After the match, van Eijden reflected on the loss, quoting: \\"After the final, we have had a day off, and I used to spend a lot of time on the bed and did not do much. As a professional, you're used to turning the button back quickly. The pain lasted for a few days.\\" Towards the end of the season, he remained captain in absence of Vlaar, before a groin operation ended his season ahead of the Europa League Qualification's Play–offs. Despite this, van Eijden went on to make the total of 38 appearances in his first season at AZ Alkmaar. In the 2017–18 season, van Eijden found himself in a new competition with Vlaar, Pantelis Hatzidiakos and Stijn Wuytens. As a result, he was demoted to the reserve side.

D4 was laid down on 24 February 1910, launched 27 May 1911 and was commissioned on 29 November 1911. She was the first submarine to be fitted with a gun for offensive use. During World War I, on 22 June 1915, D4 found the stranded German minesweeper Bielefeld in the Heligoland Bight off Juist, Germany, guarded by a German destroyer. D4′s commanding officer decided to attack the destroyer first, but the torpedo D4 fired missed. The alerted destroyer made several runs over D4, which was submerged in water only 30 feet (9.1 meters) deep, in an attempt to ram her, but did not succeed and eventually left the scene. D4 then surfaced and sank Bielefeld.

Five minutes later Lt Claud Barry, in command of D4, saw UB-72, obviously unaware of the British boat's presence, alter course so that the U-boat appeared to be approaching D4. In order that his presence should not be detected Lt Barry lowered his periscope for a few minutes but at 0443 D4′s periscope was raised to reveal UB-72 steering an easterly course. A few minutes later UB-72 was on the British boat's port side and Barry waited until the U-boat came on to his sights. At 0450 Lt Barry fired a torpedo 600 yards (549 meters) from the target and after lowering the periscope for a few moments he released a second one. Ten seconds later the crew of D4 heard an explosion and felt a violent concussion. Barry brought his boat to the surface and headed towards three men swimming in a patch of oil.

History =World War I= During the First World War, No. 1 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps — formed at Point Cook in January 1916,Halley 1988, p. 465. — was referred to by British authorities from 16 March 1916 to February 1918 as \\"No. 67 Squadron RFC\\" to avoid confusion with No. 1 Squadron, RFC,Rawlings 1978, p. 169. not to mention No. 1 Squadron, RNAS, and because the AFC was in any case not recognised as being independent of the RFC. Early in 1918 this recognition was belatedly granted, and thereafter the unit was known in all quarters by its original designation. The unit itself never regarded itself as part of the RFC, and never used its official RFC number – it is considered as the \\"ancestor\\" of No. 1 Squadron RAAF and has no real connection with the later RAF unit.The war diary of 67 Squadron is not held by the Australian War Memorial, although they do have No. 1 Squadron's war diary from January 1918. In particular, at the time of the formation of the RAF in April 1918 there was no \\"No. 67 Squadron RFC\\" to become an RAF unit of that number. Hence the first No. 67 Squadron RAF was the one formed during the Second World War – and described hereunder. =World War II= Brewster Buffaloes of 67 Squadron being re-assembled at Singapore following shipment from the USA. February 1941 The true origins of No. 67 Squadron RAF date from its so-called \\"re-formation\\" during World War II at Kallang Airport in Malaya on 12 March 1941. It was equipped with the Brewster Buffalo, an aeroplane that was outclassed in Europe, but considered adequate to build up the defences in Asia. In October, it handed on its aircraft to No. 488 Squadron RNZAF and moved to Burma, taking on instead the Buffaloes of No. 60 Squadron RAF. The inadequacy of the Buffaloes led to their replacement with Hawker Hurricanes in February 1942,Halley 1988, p. 133. but the Japanese offensive could not be halted and by March 1942 the squadron \\"ceased to be effective\\". The squadron re-assembled at Alipore and formed part of the defence of Calcutta, converting to Spitfires in February 1944. The squadron disbanded officially on 23 August 1945 at Akyab, but kept its aircraft till the end of the month. =The Jet Age= On 1 September 1950 the squadron reformed as a jet fighter-bomber unit, flying Vampire FB.5s first from RAF Wattisham and later from Gutersloh as part of RAF Germany. After a short return to the UK in April 1952, being stationed at RAF Duxford on 21 April 1952, the squadron moved again to Germany in May 1952 when it moved base to Wildenrath and re-equipped there in May 1953 with North American Sabres. In July 1955 the squadron moved to another base again, RAF Bruggen and the Sabres were exchanged for Hunters. On 31 May 1957 the squadron disbanded and has not been active since.

Certain cereal varieties that have been genetically engineered. may be more susceptible to the teleomorph phase of the fungus.  Host and Symptoms  G. graminicola is an anamorphic fungus which is identified as Colletotrichum graminicola in the teleomorphic phase . It is the anamorphic phase of Colletotrichum graminicola, causes anthracnose in many cereal species including maize , sorghum, barley and wheat where the production of fruiting bodies cause symptoms to appear in the host plant. Corn anthracnose leaf blight, is the most common stalk disease in maize and occurs most frequently in reduced-till or no-till fields. Anthracnose stalk rot C. graminicola is also a pathogen of many turfgrasses, e.g., bluegrass, ryegrass, fescue. The fungus can infect many different parts of the host plant, typically the kernels and tassels of Maize, roots, leaves, stalk and husks. The most common area of infection is the stalk. G. raminicola produces three major symptom types: leaf blight, stalk rot and top die-back. The leaf blight is characterized by round yellowing water soaked lesions on the leaves. These lesions usually occur early in the season and are how this pathogen is distinguished from other diseases. Top die-back is the necrosis of the top leaves and stalk of the corn. This occurs around the same time as grain formation. The stalk rot phase becomes prominent during the late reproductive stages of the corn life cycle. It is characterized by blackening of the pith tissue in the stalk and also of the rind, beginning at the nodes closest to the soil. Along with these symptoms, seedling blight and post emergence damping off are also found.  Identification  Stromata * 70-300 μm in diameter * Bear prominent, dark, septate spines (setae) up to 100 μm long. Conidia * Developing at the base of the spines * Hyaline to pale yellow, unicellular, sickle-shaped, falcate to fusiform, tapered toward both ends * 3-5 x 19-29 μm. Phialides * Unicellular, hylanine and cylindrical, * 4-8 x 8-20 μm. Growth on PDA * Gray and feltlike * Conidia and appressoria are numerous when culture are well aerated, and sclerotia sometimes occur. * Appressoria are diagnostic: they are tawny brown, irregular-shaped in edge, prominent, and terminal on thickened hyphae.  Disease Cycle  In the spring, fruiting structures (acervuli) form from corn residue and produce spores (conidia) that are dispersed by wind blown raindrops and splashing. Conidial spores infect young plants through the epidermis or stomata. Anthracnose develops rapidly in cloudy, overcast conditions with high temperatures and humidity. In optimal environmental conditions, conidia can germinate in as little as 6–8 hours in 100% humidity. Initial necrotic spots or lesions can be seen within 72 hours after infection by conidia. Lower leaves that develop lesions provide conidial spores and cause secondary infections on the upper leaves and stalk. Vascular infections primarily occur from wounds caused by stalk-boring insects, such as the larvae of the European corn borer, allowing for conidia to infect and colonize the xylem. From this, anthracnose top die back (vascular wilt) or stalk rot can occur. In the fall, C. graminicola survives as a saprophyte on corn leaf residue. The pathogen can also overwinter on corn stalks as conidia in an extracellular secretion. The secretion prevents conidia from desiccating and protects them from unfavorable environmental conditions. Overwintering on corn residue serves as a vital source of primary inoculum for the leaf blight phase in the spring. The cycle will start all over again when susceptible corn seedlings emerge from the ground in the spring.  Disease Management  Since C. graminicola is found to survive on corn residue, specifically on the soil surface; one of the most effective methods of control is a one-year minimum of crop rotation to reduce anthracnose leaf blight. A study in 2009 showed more severe symptoms of leaf blight due to C. graminicola when grown on fields previously used for corn in comparison to fields previously used for soybean. Other management methods include the use of hybrid selections and tillage systems. Keeping in mind, hybrid selection may be resistant to leaf blight but they are not necessary resistant to other fungal diseases such as stalk rot. Tillage systems that are able to fully bury corn residue deep underground along with one year crop rotation will reduce the source of inoculum greatly. More work is still needed in order to determine the influence of buried and surface corn residues as a source of inoculum for corn anthracnose.³  Importance  Corn anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum graminicola is a disease present worldwide. This disease can affect all parts of the plant and can develop at any time during the growing season. This disease is typically seen in leaf blight or stalk rot form. Before the 1970s, Anthracnose was not an issue in North America. In the early 1970s, north-central and eastern U.S was hit with severe epidemics. Within 2 years of C.graminicola’s appearance in Western-Indiana sweet corn production for canning companies were nearly wiped out and production no longer exists there today. Anthracnose stalk rot was seen in many U.S corn fields in the 1980s and 1990s. A survey conducted in Illinois in 1982 and 1983 found that 34 to 46% of rotted corn stalks contained C. graminicola. Estimates on yield grain losses from anthracnose leaf blight and stalk rot range from zero to over 40%. This is dependent on hybrid, environment, timing of infection, and other stresses. The impacts of C. graminicola are predicted to increase as the use of Bt corn becomes more common. Bt engineered corn has been seen to have a greater proportion of stalk rot and be more susceptible to C. graminicola compared to strains without Bt.  Pathogenesis  Once conidia germinate on corn leaves, a germ tube differentiates and develops into an appresoria and allows C. graminicola to penetrate epidermal cells. Germination and appressorium formation occur best in the temperature range (15-30°C) Penetration occurs in a much narrower temperature range (25-30°C). In order to penetrate the cell wall, the fungus first pumps melanin into the walls of the appressorium to create turgor pressure in the appressorium. The melanin allows water into the appressorium cell but nothing out. This builds up an incredible amount of turgor pressure which the fungus then uses to push a hyphae through the corn cell wall. This is called the penetration peg. The penetration peg then grows, extends through the cell extracting nutrients and the host cell wall dies. Hyphae migrate from epidermal cells to mesophyll cells. As a defense response, the cells produce papillae to prevent cell entry but is typically not seen successful. It is believed C. graminicola has a biotrophic phase because the plasma membrane of the epidermal cells is not immediately penetrated after invasion into the epidermal cell wall. Between 48–72 hours after infection, C. graminicola shifted from biotrophic growth to nectrotrophy (lesions appear). This is when secondary hyphae invade cell walls and intercellular spaces.

The underpass serve the transit traffic of city center to Konyaaltı, while the upper part Dumlupınar Bulvarı and roundabout are maintained by General Directorate of Highways as D-400 Highway. The western entryway into Linköping, Sweden (a branch off the backbone E4 highway) passes on a bridge above this roundabout, which connects a national road and a local road into a residential area with ramps leading up to the free-flowing road (note the green signage denoting that in these directions you are entering a motorway). A roundabout interchange is a type of interchange between a controlled access highway, such as a motorway or freeway, and a minor road. The slip roads to and from the motorway carriageways converge at a single roundabout, which is grade-separated from the motorway lanes with bridges.  Design  A roundabout interchange is similar to a rotary interchange, which uses a rotary rather than a roundabout. Roundabouts may also be used in conjunction with other interchange types such as a standard or folded diamond interchange, but such use should not be confused with a roundabout interchange. Roundabout interchanges are extremely common in the United Kingdom and Ireland with hundreds on the motorway network alone. However, recent cost cutting has meant that dumbbell interchanges are increasingly used instead. These are essentially diamond interchanges with roundabouts instead of signals or stop signs where the slip roads meet the minor road. They are cheaper than roundabout interchanges as only one bridge is required instead of two. Roundabout interchanges are much less common in North America but have been built more frequently since 1995, to improve safety, and to reduce traffic delays and bridge widening costs. However, many of the older and more dangerous rotary-style overpass interchanges have been signalized to improve throughput and safety, such as the former Drum Hill Rotary (now Drum Hill Square) in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, in New England, where such interchanges are unusually common. A divided diamond, in which the minor road is separated into four intersections, rather than two, also acts like a roundabout interchange, but it is more square in shape and, typically, has traffic light control. Examples Motorways crossing in the Czech Republic. * The junction of the M1, M69, and A4560 at Braunstone in England is an example of a British-style (in this case, partially signalized) roundabout interchange. * Kinsale Road Roundabout south of Cork, Ireland, on the N40 South Ring Road at the N27 Airport Road is a signalized roundabout interchange. * New York State Route 201 and Riverside Drive, Johnson City, New York, has the roundabout to the side of the freeway with underpasses for the on and off ramps. * Denham Roundabout (M40 and Oxford Road), Denham, Buckinghamshire, connects the motorway ramps to local streets using a large circular roadway containing multiple intersections, several of which are roundabouts. * U.S. Route 9 and New York State Route 2, Latham, New York, is a roundabout interchange with U-turn lanes for the freeway. * Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C., is a roundabout interchange between several local roads including Connecticut Avenue, NW, which passes underneath the roundabout. * Washington Circle, in Foggy Bottom, Washington, D.C., is another example of a roundabout interchange similar to the one in Dupont Circle. Here, K Street traverses beneath the intersection. * Échangeur de Villarcher, in Voglans near Chambéry is a rare example of roundabout interchange in France. It links two former national roads (D 1201 and D 1504), where D 1201 passes above the roundabout through a bridge. * A roundabout is used as an interchange between Quebec Autoroute 20 and Quebec Autoroute 520 in Montreal, Quebec. The roundabout is known as the Dorval Circle. Ramps to side streets are added as well. The interchange is currently being replaced. The Rottepolderplein in the Netherlands is a three-level roundabout Three-level stacked roundabout The three-level stacked roundabout is a variation on the roundabout interchange in which both roads are grade-separated. It is similar to the three-level diamond interchange except that the small square of that latter interchange is enlarged to a true roundabout. If the roundabout is sufficiently large, the interchange may require only two levels. * Causeway Boulevard (LA 3046) and Airline Highway (US 61), Metairie, Louisiana, has the traffic circle between the two roads. * Staples Corner (A406 and A5), Dollis Hill, Greater London, has the roundabout on the ground. * Whitton Expressway (US 63 Southbound and US 50), US 63 Northbound and US 54 in Jefferson City, Missouri, has more of a square shape instead, but it functions like a roundabout. Three-level stacked roundabouts are quite common in Britain because they use less land than other four-way junctions where both roads are grade separated. However, they have lower capacity for turning movements - some have had direct-linking slip roads added later in an attempt to solve this problem. Examples of such junctions are found at Lofthouse, West Yorkshire (M1/M62; ) and Swanley, Kent (M20/M25; ).

Its form is a ring with an apparent radius of approximately 22° around the Sun or Moon. When visible around the Moon, it is called a moon ring or winter halo. It forms as direct sunlight or moonlight is refracted in millions of hexagonal ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. The halo appears large; its radius is roughly the length of an outstretched hand at arm's length. A 22° halo may be visible on as many as 100 days per year – much more frequently than rainbows.  Formation  Pathway of light through a hexagonal prism in the optimal angle resulting in minimum deviation. Path of the light from the clouds to the observer. Even though it is one of the most common types of halo, the exact shape and orientation of the ice crystals responsible for the 22° halo are the topic of debate. Hexagonal, randomly oriented columns are usually put forward as the most likely candidate, but this explanation presents problems, such as the fact that the aerodynamic properties of such crystals leads them to be oriented horizontally rather than randomly. Alternative explanations include the involvement of clusters of bullet-shaped ice columns. As light passes through the 60° apex angle of the hexagonal ice prisms it is deflected twice resulting in deviation angles ranging from 22° to 50°. The angle of minimum deviation is almost 22° (or more specifically 21.84° on average; 21.54° for red light and 22.37° for blue light). This wavelength-dependent variation in refraction causes the inner edge of the circle to be reddish while the outer edge is bluish. The ice crystals in the clouds all deviate the light similarly, but only the ones from the specific ring at 22 degrees contribute to the effect for an observer at a set distance. As no light is refracted at angles smaller than 22°, the sky is darker inside the halo. (Including excellent illustrations and animations.) Another phenomenon resulting in a ring around the Sun or Moon—and therefore sometimes confused with the 22° halo—is the corona. Unlike the 22° halo, however, it is produced by water droplets instead of ice crystals and it is much smaller and more colorful.  Weather relation  In folklore, moon rings are said to warn of approaching storms. Like other ice halos, 22° halos appear when the sky is covered by thin cirrus or cirrostratus clouds that often come a few days before a large storm front. However, the same clouds can also occur without any associated weather change, making a 22° halo unreliable as a sign of bad weather.

Description The D-class submarines were designed as improved and enlarged versions of the preceding C class, with diesel engines replacing the dangerous petrol engines used earlier. D3 and subsequent boats were slightly larger than the earlier boats. They had a length of overall, a beam of and a mean draught of . They displaced on the surface and submerged.Harrison, Chapter 4 The D-class submarines had a crew of 25 officers and other ranks and were the first to adopt saddle tanks.Gardiner & Gray, p. 87 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesels, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the D class had a range of at . The boats were armed with three 18-inch (45 cm) torpedo tubes, two in the bow and one in the stern. They carried one reload for each tube, a total of six torpedoes. Construction and career D5 was one of six D-class submarines ordered from Vickers Armstrong under the 1909–1910 Naval Estimates and was laid down at Vickers' Barrow-in-Furness shipyard on 23 February 1910. She was launched on 28 August 1911 and completed on 19 January 1912.Harrison Appendix 1, p. I.5. On the outbreak of the First World War, D5, along with the rest of her class, was assigned to the 8th Submarine Flotilla. The Flotilla, including D5 was assigned to patrol in the east end of the English Channel during the passage of the British Expeditionary Force to France in early August.Croce 2016, p. 14. On 21 August 1914, D5 was on patrol west of Heligoland when she spotted a force of German warships that were carrying out a sortie into the North Sea against British fishing vessels. D5 fired two torpedoes at the German light cruiser , both of which missed.  Wreck  D5 met her fate south of South Cross Buoy off Great Yarmouth in the North Sea. She was sunk by a German mine laid by on 3 November 1914 after responding to a German attack on Yarmouth by cruisers. There were only five survivors, including her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Godfrey Herbert. In 2016 Historic England commissioned an investigation of the wreck site by Wessex Archaeology as part of Archaeological Services in Relation to Marine Protection, a two year project to assess a selection of underwater sites around the English coast. The investigation involved a geophysical survey over the location of the wreck site followed by a diver survey, which found that whilst the wreck of D5 meets the criteria for designation, it is sufficiently buried as to not be at risk. The decision was ultimately made not to designate the wreck at that time.

Overview The novel is an adventure involving the original Star Trek series cast and journeys through many eras of the Trek timeline. The story is presented as a book within a book featuring excerpts from a novel called Strangers from the Sky by fictional author Garamet Jen-Saunor which claims that the official records of how the Human and Vulcan races met for the first time were incorrect. The beginning and ending of the book takes place during James T. Kirk's years in the admiralty when he begins to suffer from psychological issues after reading Jen-Saunor's book which is a gift from Doctor McCoy. Kirk becomes somewhat obsessed with the story and starts to have disturbing dreams in which he is present during the book's events which, in the dreams, result in disaster. When McCoy refers Kirk for evaluation, the results show him to be in a mentally unstable state and the authorities assume he is delusional like many other people who have become obsessed with the book. When Spock is similarly affected and diagnosed, the only cure for them both is to be found in a mind meld. The meld reveals that both were actually present during the events described in Jen-Saunor's book. The second half of the novel takes place during Kirk's first days in command of the Enterprise when he, Spock and other members of his crew including Gary Mitchell and Elizabeth Dehner, are accidentally transported back to the year 2045 and participate in the true first contact events. The book occasionally foreshadows and refers to the events of the original series pilot \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\". Production The basic concept of this book—in which Vulcans accidentally land on Earth years before the official \\"First Contact\\"—is echoed in the Star Trek: Enterprise episode \\"Carbon Creek\\". Strangers from the Sky was the first Star Trek book to be produced as an audiobook. It was read by George Takei and Leonard Nimoy. Whilst Takei read the majority of the book, Nimoy occasionally interjected in-character as Spock at certain points during the plot.

Ancient Arab traders had traveled to Jerusalem for trade purposes and heard the gospel from St Peter (Acts 2:11) and Paul the apostle spent several years in Arabia (Galatians 1:17), later further strengthened by the ministry of St Thomas who went to Arabia, Persia and later to the Indian subcontinent. Purportedly, one of the earliest church buildings ever discovered by archaeologists is located in Saudi Arabia, known as Jubail Church, built around the 4th century. Some parts of modern Saudi Arabia (such as Najran) were predominantly Christian until the 7th to 10th century, when most Christians were expelled or converted to Islam or left the region via the Sea route to Asia, with which merchant trade already existed, others migrated north to Jordan and Syria and settled into those new places. Some Arab Christians who remained lived as crypto-Christians, or secret Christians. Some Arabian tribes, such as Banu Taghlib and Banu Tamim, followed Christianity. Ancient Arabian Christianity has largely vanished from the region. 1858 massacre of Christians in Jeddah On June 15, 1858, 21 Christian residents of Jeddah, then an Ottoman town of 5,000 predominantly Muslim inhabitants, were massacred, including the French and British consuls, by \\"some hundreds of Hadramites, inhabitants of Southern Arabia\\", maybe as a retaliation after the repression by the British of the Indian Rebellion of 1857-1859. 24 others, mostly Greeks and Levantines, some \\"under British protection\\" plus the daughter of the French consul and the French interpreter, both badly wounded, escaped and took refuge, some by swimming to it, aboard the ship HMS Cyclops.The Church of England quarterly review, 1858 p.218-219John McDowell Leavitt, Nathaniel Smith Richardson, Henry Mason Baum G.B.

Saudi Arabia allows Christians to enter the country as foreign workers for work or tourism, but does not allow them to practice their faith openly. Because of that Christians generally only worship within private homes. Items and articles belonging to religions other than Islam are prohibited. These include Bibles, crucifixes, statues, carvings, items with religious symbols, and others. The Saudi Arabian Mutaween (), or Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (i.e., the religious police) prohibits the practice of any religion other than Islam. Conversion of a Muslim to another religion is considered apostasy, a crime punishable by death if the accused does not recant. There have been no confirmed reports of executions for either crime in modern times. The Government does not permit non-Muslim clergy to enter the country for the purpose of conducting religious services. In spite of this, a 2015 study estimates that there are some 60,000 Christians with a Muslim background living in the country, though that does not mean that all of those are citizens of the country. International Christian Concern (ICC) protested what it reported as the 2001 detention of 11 Christians in Saudi Arabia, for practicing their religion in their homes. In June 2004, at least 46 Christians were arrested in what the ICC described as a \\"pogrom-like\\" action by Saudi police. The arrests took place shortly after the media reported that a Quran had been desecrated in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

At 3pm on Saturday 21 April 1928 the club’s Patron, Colonel Goodwin, officially opened the club and served the first ball. Initial work was done using picks, shovels, horse and dray. The original clubhouse was built in 1930 on the south side of the courts. The current clubhouse was opened in 1955. The club and facilities are located in Corroboree Park. Ainslie Tennis Club is an incorporated organisation managed by a Committee. Maintenance of the club and Committee management is carried out by volunteer members. The club is also an affiliate of Tennis ACT, which in term is affiliated with Tennis Australia. The club was awarded ACT ‘Tennis Club of the Year’ in 1996. In 2000, two courts were converted to synthetic grass, and in 2002 the third court was converted to synthetic grass. The club, while proud of its rich tradition, has a modern and competitive outlook. On 22 August 1927 fifteen people met at the Social Services Cottage in Lister Crescent, Ainslie to discuss the formation of a local tennis and social club. The Ainslie district was growing rapidly and there developed a need for a social outlet for new residents. A provisional committee was appointed to draft a constitution, consult with the Federal Capital Commission on the selection of a site and organise the voluntary labour to be used in construction. Thomas Boag, the Supervisor for Roads and bridges, was placed in charge of the laying of the courts. The committee agreed to devote seventeen Saturday afternoons to the formation of the club. Initial work was done using picks, shovels, horse and dray. Potential female members supplied billy tea (made in the park) for those men working on construction. Various fundraising events were held including a number of successful euchre parties. In 1955 it was suggested a new clubhouse be built. Construction was performed by the Department of Works and the present clubhouse was completed in 1957.

Description The D-class submarines were designed as improved and enlarged versions of the preceding C class, with diesel engines replacing the dangerous petrol engines used earlier. D3 and subsequent boats were slightly larger than the earlier boats. They had a length of overall, a beam of and a mean draught of . They displaced on the surface and submerged.Harrison, Chapter 4 The D-class submarines had a crew of 25 officers and other ranks and were the first to adopt saddle tanks.Gardiner & Gray, p. 87 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesels, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the D class had a range of at . The boats were armed with three 18-inch (45 cm) torpedo tubes, two in the bow and one in the stern. They carried one reload for each tube, a total of six torpedoes. Construction and career D6 was laid down on 24 February 1910 by Vickers at their Barrow shipyard, launched 23 October 1911 and was commissioned on 19 April 1912. She was the first British submarine to be equipped with a deck gun when built, a 12-pounder (3-inch/76mm) gun. D6 was sunk by UB-73 73 miles north of Inishtrahull Island off the west coast of Ireland on 24 or 28 June 1918.

It is the work of Les Cawley and Geoff Challinor who began collecting and showing stationary engines for a hobby. The museum now has one of the largest collections of engines in Europe. The museum site also includes a working blacksmith's smithy and carpentry shop and a café. Location The Anson Engine Museum is situated on the site of the old Anson colliery in Poynton, Cheshire, England. History =Coal= Coal is found outcropping to the east of Towers Road, Poynton which corresponds to the line of the Red Rock Fault; that is at the surface. It has been worked from early times. The earliest record to be found is a lease dated 28 February 1589, which talks of the \\"Coal pit at Wourthe lately occupied by George Finche\\". This was originally worked on the surface then by shallow shafts, and later by deeper shafts with waterwheels or steam engines operating pumps and winding gear. In the later 18th century, the Warrens of Poynton co-operated with the Leghs of Lyme to work the Cannel and Sheepwash seams at Norbury Hollow. Output in 1789 was over 23,586 tonnes (26,000 tons) rising to a peak production of 221,056 tonnes (243,673 tons) in 1859.Industrial history of Poynton. Poyntonweb website. Retrieval Date: 25 September 2007. The Poynton Colleries were substantial, and the coal rights were held by the Warren family who leased them the Wrights and the Claytons. In 1826 the estate passed to George John Venables Vernon, 4th Lord Vernon who decided in 1832 to manage the mines himself. In 1856 it was estimated that there was a reserve of 15,163,027 tons which would supply 245,000 tons for 61 years. This was to be supplied by the Park Round Pit, and the Park Oval Pit both working the Four Foot and Five Foot Seam and the Anson Pit and the Nelson Pit which were working the Accommodation Seam. The closure of the Norbury Pits resulted in a constant ingress of water. In 1926 production was down to 80,146 tons. The collieries closed on 30 August 1935; 250 men were made redundant. Anson Pit Hig Meadow Pit was operating in 1826. It is reported to have had a Newcomen atmospherical engine with an 18-inch bore that was used for winding. There were 1088 yards of rail track beneath the surface and 22 coal tubs. In 1847 the pit was known as Anson or Lower Anson. It employed 36 men and six boys and worked the Gees Seam at a depth of 132 yards. It now had a 16 HP engine. In 1853 they descended to the Accommodation Seam at 191 yards, and also worked the Reform Seam at 147 yards. In 1856, they were producing 170 tons of coal a day. The winding engine was replaced in 1869 by one with 2 horizontal cylinders 25in bore and 60in stroke. They had double beat valves. The rope drum was 14 ft in diameter. This engine was still working in 1926 when the pit closed. A further engine was installed to haul tubs up a 900yard, 1 in 7 incline in the Accommodation seam. It had two horizontal cylinders 15in by 30in geared to a five-foot winding drum. Both were fed steam at 30 psi by three Lancashire Boilers. Ventilation was provided by a furnace at Horse Pasture Pit, and also by other ventilation furnaces at Walker Pit, Venture Pit and Higher Canal Pit. The Anson Colliery is now the site of the Anson Engine Museum, all other shafts have been capped and Park Pit has been levelled. =Museum= The museum is the result of years of work by Les Cawley and Geoff Challinor who began collecting and showing stationary engines for a hobby. When the number and size of engines they collected increased, they decided to start the museum. A charitable trust was formed and work began on the first building in 1986. The museum first opened to the public in 1989. For many years it opened only on odd days and times to suit their hobby and the small number of visitors that dropped in to see the collection. In July 2002 Les Cawley died and Geoff Challinor dedicated himself to making the museum into an attraction that would bring visitors from around the world. Exhibits =Crossley, Mirrlees and Gardner engines= Among the earliest engines are the original number 1 engines built by Crossley and Mirrlees. Manchester became predominant in the development and manufacture of stationary engines, and by the 1900s, there were over 20 engine makers in existence within 20 miles of the museum. Mirrlees, Bickerton & Day, in Hazel Grove, concentrated on developing the light and heavy oil diesel engine and L Gardner & Sons of Patricroft become known the world over for their role in bringing the small high-speed, quality diesel engines to the industrial and marine markets and Crossley Brothers in Openshaw took up Nicolaus Otto and Langen patents. Local manufacturers are the prime focus of the museum exhibits. =Top attractions= Today the museum has one of the largest collection of engines in Europe and attracts stationary engine enthusiasts from around the globe. Over the past few years it has picked up awards for its displays, volunteers and for some of the engines. Among the top attraction engines are:- *Largest running example of Crossley Atmospheric gas engine; *Award Winning, original L Gardner & Sons L series engine along with Engineering Heritage Hallmark Scheme (EHHS) plaque from Institution of Mechanical Engineers; *Oldest diesel engine in the UK - Mirrlees No1; *Original Crossley No1 engine; *Steam engine area with a Stott cross-compound mill engine and a Fowler beam engine; *Very rare Griffin 6-stroke engine; *Rare Atkinson cycle engine; *Crossley over-hung crank; *Hugon gas engine; *63 ton Ruston & Hornsby used at Ealing Studios.

The theme tune was performed by Lulu, composed by John Barry - returning to the series after a one film absence (George Martin had scored the preceding film Live and Let Die), and the lyrics to the song were written by Don Black. Alice Cooper claims his song \\"Man With The Golden Gun\\" was to be used by the film's producers until it was dropped for Lulu's song instead. Cooper's song appears on the album Muscle of Love. Barry considered the theme tune – the only Bond film title track not to chart as a single in either the U.K. or U.S. – and score to be among the weakest of his contributions to the series: \\"It's the one I hate most... it just never happened for me.\\" Certainly the title song is notable for having suggestive lyrics, and during a TV celebration for the series' 40th anniversary, Lulu's performance was introduced with reference to its being the raunchiest of all Bond songs. For the first time, the song's end theme is not a straight reprise of the opener, as it begins with different lyrics (subsequent films followed suit with variations in arrangement, ahead of a new practice of using a different song altogether). Some Bond music fans consider Lulu's brassy vocal to be effective in setting the tone for the film's female characters. Barry's score for the film has stylistic similarities to that of Diamonds Are Forever - which had marked a gradual transition away from the heavy horn based sound of his 1960s Bond scores to a smoother, string based sound. The film was also the first to drop the distinctive plucked guitar from the Bond theme heard over the gun barrel sequence - in all subsequent John Barry James Bond scores, this theme would be heard on strings and trumpet. Not present on the album but heard in the film is a brief reprise, for recognition purposes, of the song \\"Live and Let Die\\" when a character (Sheriff JW Pepper) from the previous film reappears. The next three Bond films would wittily feature excerpts from the familiar music of other films, too (though classics rather than Bond films), while On Her Majesty's Secret Service had included a janitor character whistling the theme from Goldfinger as an in-joke. The popular song \\"Mindfields\\" by The Prodigy (released on The Fat of the Land) features a specific part of \\"Hip's Trip\\". Barry gave the band permission to do so.

He was one of America's leading older male racehorses in 1964 and 1965 and was later inducted into the Hall of Fame. Gun Bow was noted for his rivalry with five- time American Horse of the Year Kelso. Background Owned and bred by cosmetics tycoon Elizabeth Arden at her Maine Chance Farm, Gun Bow was sired by Gun Shot, a son of Hyperion, the 1933 Epsom Derby winner and a six-time leading sire in Great Britain & Ireland. He was out of the mare Ribbons and Bows, a daughter of 1937 U.S. Triple Crown champion War Admiral. Lameness kept Gun Bow out of racing at age two and as a result of American tax laws at the time, Arden sold Gun Bow in December 1962 to Harry Albert and Mrs. John Stanley of New Jersey, who raced him under the name Gedney Farms. He was conditioned by future Hall of Fame trainer Edward A. Neloy. Racing career As a three-year-old in 1963, Gun Bow won six of his eighteen starts. His most significant 1963 win came in the Narragansett Special at Narragansett Park in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. However, by age four he had developed into a powerful runner and a major rival for Kelso. In his 1964 season, Gun Bow traveled across the United States. He raced in California as well as at Arlington Park in the Midwest, plus at tracks on the East Coast, from New York thorough Florida. He won eight of his sixteen starts, including three important graded stakes races on the West Coast, and had wins in major East Coast races such as the Woodward Stakes. He defeated Kelso by twelve lengths in the Brooklyn Handicap while setting a new track record for 10 furlongs. He gave the U.S. a one-two finish against an international field when he came in second to Kelso in record time in the Washington, D.C. International. In September, his owners syndicated 60% of Gun Bow to a group led by John R. Gaines, which included former owner, Elizabeth Arden. For the 1964 racing year, Gun Bow had earnings of more than $580,000.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,830598-1,00.html Racing at age five, Gun Bow won three of eight starts, claiming his second straight San Antonio Handicap in California plus the Metropolitan and Donn Handicaps in the East. Stud career Gun Bow retired to stud duty after his 1965 racing season, but his offspring met with modest racing success. Notably, his outstanding daughter Pistol Packer won several Group One races in France, including the 1971 Prix de Diane. In 1974, Gun Bow was sold to a breeding farm in Japan where he died in December 1979. In 1999, Gun Bow was inducted into the United States' National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.http://www.racingmuseum.org/hall/horse.asp?ID=340 References * Bowen, Edward L..

He first came to national attention in the 1930s, as a Polar explorer in Greenland. His front-line service during the Second World War, during which he commanded a battalion and was decorated for bravery, further added to his reputation. Immediately after the war he went into politics and served as a Member of Parliament for nearly two decades. In 1962, he was awarded a Baronetage of the United Kingdom, being created Baronet of Dowhill in the County of Kinross. Early life Lindsay was born to a long-established Scottish noble family and could trace direct descent, as 22nd in line, to the Sir William Lindsay who was ennobled as Lord Lindsay of Crawford in 1398. Martin Lindsay was himself the son of an officer in Britain's Indian Army who became a lieutenant colonel in the 2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles. Lindsay was educated at Wellington College and at the Royal Military College Sandhurst.\\"Who Was Who\\", A & C Black. Army officer In 1925, Lindsay passed out from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Scots Fusiliers. Two years later, he was posted to Nigeria and seconded to the 4th Battalion, the Nigeria Regiment. During this period, Lindsay won Nigeria's Grand National horse race. After his 13-month stint with the Arctic expedition he was posted with the 2nd Bat. of the Royal Scots Fusiliers to Shanghai.Lindsay, Martin; Snowed in with Greenland Eskimos; China Journal, Vol. 16 (1932), p. 19–24 First expeditions At the end of his two years in Nigeria in 1929, Lindsay undertook his first expedition, travelling from West to East Africa through the Ituri Rainforest in what was then called the Belgian Congo. In 1930 he was appointed Surveyor to the British Arctic Air Route Expedition to Greenland, led by Gino Watkins. Expedition members included John Rymill and Freddie Spencer Chapman but, as a seasoned Army officer, Lindsay brought a disciplined organisational and administrative experience to the team. Lindsay later wrote up his experiences in a book Those Greenland Days (1932), paying tribute to Watkins' team building. The success of this expedition resulted in Lindsay and the other key expedition members being awarded the Polar Medal, with the clasp Arctic 1930–1931. Lindsay enjoyed writing about explorers and, in 1933, followed up his success with The Epic of Captain Scott, his tribute to the famous explorer. =British Trans-Greenland Expedition= In 1934 Lindsay was the Leader of the British Trans-Greenland Expedition under the patronage of the Prince of Wales. The expedition was sponsored by several British government ministries and aimed to explore and map a 350-mile long stretch of Greenland which had not previously been visited but contained the highest mountains in the Arctic Circle. Andrew Croft was the photographer for the expedition; Lt. Daniel Godfrey was in charge of survey and navigation. The expedition crossed Greenland from west to east, and succeeded in fixing the positions of many important features including Gunnbjørnsfjeld. On the return journey the team headed south-west to Amassalik (now Tasiilaq) and on their journey discovered the extent of the Crown Prince Frederick Range (Kronprins Frederik Bjerge). Lindsay's expedition set a new world record after sledging for 1,050 miles (700 of which were through unexplored territory). When all three returned safe and well, the expedition was regarded as an unqualified success, with The Times devoting a leader to it. The Times observed that \\"for daring and success [it] will rank high in the long annals of polar exploration\\".\\"The Greenland Expedition\\" (Leader), The Times, 13 October 1934. Lindsay had also written his report of the expedition for The Times and in 1935 wrote a book, Sledge, based on these reports. His fame extended beyond Britain and in April 1935 he was awarded the Alexandre de la Roquette Gold Medal by the French Geographical Society for his leadership.\\"French Honour For British Explorer\\", The Times, 12 April 1935. Civilian interlude In 1936, Lindsay left the army. He had married a distant cousin, Joyce Lindsay, in 1932 and they had a young family. He moved to Lincolnshire where he was adopted as Conservative Party candidate for Brigg in June 1936.\\"Mr. M. Lindsay to stand for Parliament\\", The Times, 9 June 1936. The constituency was held by Labour with a majority of only 203, and Lindsay began to attend social events in the constituency in an attempt to build up his chances of election. He was a Deputy Lieutenant of Lincolnshire from 1938. Second World War Lindsay wrote to The Times in April 1939 to support the introduction of conscription, based on his knowledge of the people of Brigg, stating that \\"so widespread is the determination of the British working man to 'Stop Hitler' that I do not believe there would be any opposition of importance\\".The Times, 25 April 1939. =Norwegian Campaign= Lindsay returned to soldiering 1939, on the outbreak of the Second World War and served in a staff appointment during the Norwegian campaign. It was just three years since he had left the Army. In the spring of 1940 Britain decided to send troops to Northern Norway and Lindsay, with his experience of organising Polar expeditions, was an obvious choice to help advise on the particular problems the climate and terrain could bring to military operations. However he became deeply critical of the poorly organised and ill-prepared operation in Norway to the extent that he feared that Britain would lose the war unless important lessons were learned following the debacle.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lindsay-memorandum-describing- british-chaos-led-to-toppling-of-neville-chamberlain-and-churchill-taking- power-t85pvdnsb Lindsay was one of the first soldiers to reach London following the evacuation from Norway, and presented his candid account of the operation to members of His Majesty's Opposition such as Clement Attlee and Herbert Morrison.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lindsay-memorandum- describing-british-chaos-led-to-toppling-of-neville-chamberlain-and-churchill- taking-power-t85pvdnsb This report became known as the \\"Lindsay Memorandum\\" in which Lindsay recalled an operation riven with the utmost incompetence, which he contended went to the very top of the government. The evidence presented by Lindsay was used by Attlee in order to bring about a vote of censure against the leadership of the then Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, which ultimately led to Chamberlain's resignation, the appointment of Winston Churchill and the creation of a coalition government.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lindsay-memorandum-describing- british-chaos-led-to-toppling-of-neville-chamberlain-and-churchill-taking- power-t85pvdnsb Lindsay's contribution to the Norwegian Campaign resulted in him being Mentioned in Despatches. =Subsequent operations= In July 1944 Lindsay was appointed second-in-command of the 1st Battalion The Gordon Highlanders, in the 51st Highland Division. He commanded the battalion in sixteen operations between July 1944 and May 1945, being again Mentioned in Despatches, wounded in action, and receiving the Distinguished Service Order.Lt-Col Martin Lindsay, \\"So Few Got Through\\", London: Collins, 1946/Arrow Books (pbk; nd)/Leo Cooper, 2000, . He ended the war as a lieutenant colonel. As was already his pattern, he wrote up his experiences in So Few Got Through: The Diary of an Infantry Officer in 1946; this was followed by a recap of his Arctic exploits, Three Got Through: Memoirs of an Arctic Explorer the following year. Member of Parliament Lindsay's political career had been put on hold during the war – he had resigned his Brigg candidacy – instead in June 1945, just after the war in Europe had ended, he was adopted as Conservative candidate for Solihull, a newly created constituency which was expected to be safely Conservative.\\"Election Candidates\\", The Times, 7 June 1945. His Labour opponent was the future cabinet minister Roy Jenkins, but Lindsay beat him by 5,049. =Comment: early issues= His maiden speech on 7 November 1945 dwelt on the problems of an international arms race between the United States and Soviet Union. Lindsay supported giving details of the atomic bomb to the latter \\"if she would agree to cooperate and take part in a mutual system of controls and inspections\\".\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 8 November 1945. Early in his Parliamentary career he concentrated on conditions for servicemen and ex-servicemen; in May 1946 he encouraged discharged officers to take up posts with the Colonial Office and with the Control Commission in occupied enemy countries.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 4 May 1946. A week later he condemned the Germany Control Commission's publication \\"The British Zone in Germany\\" as \\"a miserable little rag\\" because it was a pale ghost of the Manchester Guardian.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 11 May 1946. He was a firm opponent of nationalisation of the steel industry, which took place. Lindsay spoke in October 1946 in support of German prisoners of war being allowed to remain in Britain and being allowed British citizenship, because of the shortage of skilled labour.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 18 October 1946. =Comment: the John Strachey controversy= Although a generally moderate MP, Lindsay could be roused to anger. In April 1949, a criticism of the Conservative Party by Minister of Food John Strachey prompted Lindsay, recalling Strachey's association with Oswald Mosley, to ask \\"Is it in order for an ex-member of the Fascist Party ...\\", the rest of the sentence being drowned out by angry shouts from Labour MPs.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 6 April 1949. The exchange between the two caused a major row involving many Members of Parliament.\\"Commons Debate Ends In Angry Scenes\\", The Times, 6 April 1949. Journalism Outside Parliament, Lindsay also contributed his journalistic skill, writing the text for a book about the House of Commons published in the \\"Britain in Pictures\\" series in 1947. In 1948, with debates on the House of Lords starting as a result of the Labour government's Parliament Bill, he wrote Shall We Reform 'the Lords'?, which discussed the options which might be taken. He was Chairman of the West Midlands Area of Conservative and Unionist Associations from 1949 to 1952. During the 1950 general election, Lindsay made a speech at Wellington, Shropshire in which he prophesied that Aneurin Bevan would soon take over as Prime Minister after Clement Attlee retired.\\"Election speeches\\", The Times, 16 February 1950. During the close Parliament of 1950–51, Lindsay played his part in harrying the Labour government. In November 1950 he won a spot in the ballot for Private Member's Bills and introduced a freedom of information Bill to give the press a statutory right to report the proceedings of public bodies.\\"Private Members' Bills\\", The Times, 17 November 1950. Lindsay's Bill ran out of time; he also supported the bill, that became statute, introduced by Labour MP Eirene White reforming the divorce laws.\\"Divorce Bill Carried\\", The Times, 10 March 1951. Early in 1951 he called on Belgium not to put General von Falkenhausen, the former German military governor, on trial for war crimes. Lindsay argued that Belgium had the least oppressive occupation of any nation.\\"Trial Of General Von Falkenhausen\\", The Times, 1 February 1951. Churchill's second ministry Lindsay was not offered any government posts when Churchill returned to office in 1951. He pressed the new government to set up an all-party conference on House of Lords reform,\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 4 December 1951. and to abolish identity cards as soon as possible.\\"Future of Identity Cards\\", The Times, 21 February 1952. Lindsay also supported a committee such as that run by Eric Geddes in 1920 to cut public expenditure, criticising \\"the Government's hitherto total failure to fulfil their election promises\\" to make a substantial economy.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 11 November 1952. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1952. At the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, Lindsay served as a Gold Staff Officer. He was a member of the Royal Company of Archers, the Queen's Body Guard for Scotland. Writing in his constituency association's magazine in June 1954, he stated that Winston Churchill would retire before that autumn to make way for Anthony Eden and predicted that Harold Macmillan would be promoted to be the new Foreign Secretary.\\"Ministerial changes forecast\\", The Times, 4 June 1954. In the autumn he became interested in the problems of road congestion and tabled a motion urging a much increased road programme to solve it.\\"Political Notes\\", The Times, 25 November 1954. =Comment: capital punishment= When Sydney Silverman proposed the abolition of capital punishment in 1956, Lindsay put down an amendment to retain it only for the murder of a police officer.\\"Little Change In Voting\\", The Times, 13 March 1956. =Comment: car industry= Despite the significant employment in the car industry in his constituency, he once in parliament criticised workers in the industry for \\"shoddy workmanship\\",\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 21 March 1956. When the workers at British Motor Corporation were ordered on strike that summer, Lindsay pointed to the fact that 53% of workers had reported for work as usual to observe that it was an unpopular strike.\\"B.M.C. Claim 53 Per Cent. Ignore Strike\\", The Times, 24 July 1956. 1956–1964 =Comment: the Suez Crisis and length of Parliament's debates= Lindsay was one of the sponsors of a motion critical of the United States after the Suez Crisis.\\"'Anti-American' Motion Dropped\\", The Times, 2 April 1957. He was critical of the Macmillan government in July 1957 for not doing enough to tackle inflation,\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 26 July 1957. and led a group of three MPs who abstained on it.Four-Point Attack On Inflation\\", The Times, 26 July 1957. At the end of 1957 he criticised the mediocrity of many MPs and called for reforms to House of Commons procedures including ending all-night sittings,\\"Procedure In Parliament\\" (letter), The Times, 28 December 1957. in a letter which prompted a long debate. At the end of January 1958 the House of Commons set up a Select Committee on the issue, with Lindsay criticising the continued denigration of Parliament by newspapers who were also damaging the Royal family.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 1 February 1958. When the Parliamentary group on Egypt and Syria was formed in June 1960, Lindsay was appointed Chairman.\\"M.P.s Form Egypt And Syria Group\\", The Times, 29 June 1960. =Comment: Ford Motors= In November he protested that the Government should not sell its shares in Ford Motors of Dagenham without allowing MPs to express their views.\\"M.P.s Seek Motive For Ford Shares Offer\\", The Times, 16 November 1960. Honours In the New Years' Honours list of 1962, Lindsay was made a baronet.\\"The New Year Honours\\", The Times, 1 January 1962. =Comment: Beaverbrook Newspapers= Following a lecture tour of the United States early that year, in March he tabled a strongly worded motion attacking Lord Beaverbrook for authorising editorial comments attacking the Royal family. Lindsay circulated to other Members of Parliament examples of coverage in the Daily Express, which he described as a \\"sustained vendetta\\".\\"'Vendetta Against Royal Family'\\", The Times, 21 March 1962. =Comment: European Economic Integration= He supported the Macmillan government's application to join the Common Market, commenting that it was difficult to find a banker or industrialist who did not think membership was essential.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 29 May 1962. Retirement announcement Lindsay announced in March 1963 that he would leave politics at the next election, stating his intention to take life easier.\\"M.P. leaving politics\\", The Times, 9 March 1963. =Comment= He abstained rather than support Macmillan on the Profumo affair.\\"Mr. Macmillan Unlikely To Be Leader At Election\\", The Times, 19 June 1963. Early in 1964 he called for an inquiry into the Public Trust Office, after discovering that it had lost a large sum of money in investments.\\"Public Trustee Has Lost Millions, Says M.P.\\", The Times, 7 January 1964. Later life In 1964 he was left $250,000 and a luxury Manhattan flat in the will of American philanthropist Florence Berlowitz Shaw (widow of George Hamlin Shaw and former wife of Bernard Pollak), whom he had escorted at social occasions in New York City.\\"Widow's Legacy To Sir M. Lindsay\\", The Times, 9 January 1964. The will was disputed by Mrs Shaw's three stepchildren, but eventually upheld.\\"Sir M. Lindsay to get U.S. Legacies\\", The Times, 31 October 1964. A cousin living in North Wales also left him £20,000 the same year. Lindsay indulged his interest in horse racing by becoming a racehorse breeder. Sir Martin married Joyce Lindsay (1904–1998), daughter of the Hon. Robert Hamilton Lindsay (a younger son of the 26th Earl of Crawford) and Mary Janet Clarke (daughter of Sir William Clarke, 1st Baronet) in 1932. Although sharing the same surname they are not related but share a common ancestor, Alexander Lindsay of Glenesk. Lady Lindsay divorced her husband in 1967 on grounds of his desertion.\\"Decree Against Sir Martin Lindsay\\", The Times, 28 January 1967. Later that year he took the Sunday Express to the Press Council over an article asking, after his two legacies, whether Sir Martin was \\"after a rich widow\\". The editor John Junor defended the story, but the Press Council upheld the complaint and deplored the form of journalism.\\"'Persecution' plea upheld\\", The Times, 2 October 1967. The couple had three children including his heir apparent Ronald and only daughter Jacynth Rosemary, who married Lord Mark Fitzalan-Howard, son of Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 3rd Baron Howard of Glossop. On 1 August 1969, Lindsay married Loelia, Duchess of Westminster, a former wife of the 2nd Duke of Westminster.\\"Marriages\\", The Times, 2 August 1969. In 1973 an interview was conducted with Lindsay which featured in the episode Distant War, part of the highly acclaimed series The World At War, in which he recalled his critique of the Norwegian Campaign and the subsequent response to it.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1129867/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm Involved in business as Chairman of several companies, Lindsay was Chairman of the Standing Council of the Baronetage and wrote his final book on \\"The Baronetage\\" in 1977.

Stability of Lithium Superoxide LiO2 in the Gas Phase: Computational Study of Dimerization and Disproportionation Reactions. J. Phys. Chem. A, 2010, 114 (31), 8165–816. It is an unstable free radical that has been analyzed using infrared (IR), Raman, electronic, electron spin resonance, soft X-ray spectroscopies, and a variety of theoretical methods. Structure Experimental studies indicate that the LiO2 molecule contains highly ionic bonds.Andrews, L. Infrared Spectrum, Structure, Vibrational Potential Function, and Bonding in the Lithium Superoxide Molecule LiO2. J. Phys. Chem. 1969, 50, 4288. Eighteen different values were attained using six isotopic species. This indicated that the force constant between the two oxygen atoms corresponds with the constant found for the O2− ion. Studies indicate that there is little to no covalent character in the LiO2 molecule. The bond length for the O-O bond was determined to be 1.34 Å. Using a simple crystal structure optimization, the Li-O bond was calculated to be approximately 2.10 Å.Lau, K.C.; Curtiss, L.A. Density Functional Investigation of the Thermodynamic Stability of Lithium Oxide Bulk Crystalline Structures of Oxygen Pressure. J. Phys. Chem. 2011, 115 (47), 23625-23633. Lithium superoxide is extremely reactive because of the odd electron present in the π* molecular orbital.Lindsay, D.M.; Garland, D.A. ESR Spectra of Matrix-Isolated LiO2. J. Phys. Chem. 1987, 91(24), 6158-6161. There have been quite a few studies regarding the clusters formed by LiO2 molecules. The most common dimer has been found to be the cage isomer. Second to it is the singlet bypyramidal structure. Studies have also been done on the chair complex and the planar ring, but these two are less favorable, though not necessarily impossible. Reactions In a lithium-air battery, when there is a one electron reduction during discharge, lithium superoxide is formed as seen in the following reaction:Das, U.; Lau, K.C.; Redfern, P.C.; Curtiss, L.A. Structure and Stability of Lithium Superoxide Clusters and Relevance to Li—O2 Batteries. J. Phys. Chem., 2014, 5 (5), 813-819. :Li+ \\\\+ e− \\\\+ O2 → LiO2 This product will then react and proceed to form lithium peroxide, Li2O2: :2LiO2 → Li2O2 \\\\+ O2 The mechanism for this last reaction has not been confirmed and chemists are having difficulties developing a theory of what may be happening. Another significant challenge of these batteries is finding an ideal solvent in which to perform these reactions; ether- and amide-based solvents are currently used, but these compounds readily react with oxygen and decompose.Bryantsev, V.S.; Faglioni, F. Predicting Autoxidation Stability of Ether- and Amide-Based Electrolyte Solvents for Li–Air Batteries. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2012, 116 (26), 7128–7138. A suitable solvent would need to be able to resist autoxidation to enable a long life cycle for the battery. Presence of the Compound The predominant use of lithium superoxide is in rechargeable lithium batteries. As portrayed in the reactions above, this lithium compound is a major component as an intermediate, an area where there is much research to be done. Researchers have much anticipation for the potential energy that may be provided by these batteries—-some say it is comparable to the internal combustion engine. One study claims that alkali superoxides affect the function of the alkyl metals in the atmosphere as well. The alkali metals are found predominantly in the mesosphere and the superoxides are found just below this where the metal reacts with the excess oxygen.Plane, J.M.C.; Rajasekhar, B.; Bartolotti, L. Theoretical and Experimental Determination of the Lithium and Sodium Superoxide Bond Dissociation Energies. J. Phys. Chem. 1989, 93, 3141-3145. Rarely are superoxides stable for any significant amount of time as they exist merely as transition states. In January 2016, researchers from Argonne National Laboratory, US, claimed that crystalline LiO2 could be stabilized in a Li-O2 battery by using a suitable graphene-based cathode.

The team has been a contender for national titles for over thirty years, having made every NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship tournament since the NCAA began sanctioning women's sports in the 1981–82 season. The team is more frequently referred to as the Lady Vols; the formal \\"Volunteers\\" nickname is regularly shortened by many fans of both men's and women's teams to \\"Vols\\", and sports media in the U.S. more commonly refer to Tennessee women's teams by the shortened version. The university considers either \\"Lady Volunteers\\" or \\"Lady Vols\\" acceptable. The Lady Vols have won at least a share of the SEC regular season championship 17 times (with the most recent occurrence being in 2015), won 17 SEC tournament championships (with the most recent occurrence being in 2014), made 18 Final Four appearances (with the most recent occurrence being in 2008), and won 8 national championships (with the most recent being in 2008). Overview The Lady Vols were coached by Pat Summitt for over four decades. Under Summitt, the Lady Vols won numerous SEC titles, appeared in 18 NCAA Final Fours and 4 AIAW Final Fours, and won 8 NCAA titles including an undefeated season. Additionally, Tennessee is the only team to have appeared in all 36 NCAA Tournaments, including 34 Sweet 16s (23 of which were consecutive). Summitt's teams were known for participating in a grueling regular season schedule, often toughest in the nation, in order to prepare the team for the NCAA tournament. This tough schedule has caused Tennessee to build up rivalries with many prominent teams, including Texas, Stanford, Louisiana Tech, Old Dominion, and, most notably, Connecticut. Like other Tennessee teams, the Lady Vols compete in the SEC, which has historically been the most dominant conference in the sport. Within the conference, Tennessee's main rivals are LSU, Vanderbilt, and Georgia, with the series vs. South Carolina and Mississippi State gaining importance due to the emergence of those schools as national powers. Summitt led Tennessee to 1098 victories, with an 84.2% win rate. The numbers at home are even stronger, as Tennessee has won 91% of home games and 93.1% of in-conference home games. 2019–20 roster History =Early years= Lady Vols basketball began at the beginning of the 20th century. However, most \\"seasons\\" consisted of three or four games. The sport was dropped in 1926 and was not picked up again until 1960. Coach Joan Cronan went 8–10 over two seasons before being replaced by Margaret Hutson, who coached for four years with a 60–18 record. In 1974, Pat Head was named the new coach. Head had previously played women's basketball for the UT-Martin Pacers (now known as the Skyhawks), and had just graduated. =Late 1970s= In the 1974–1975 season, Pat Head took over a 25–2 Lady Vols team. In her opening season, the Lady Vols won the TCWSF Eastern District Championship for the third straight year. However, the team finished only 4th overall in the TCWSF (they had been 2nd the previous two years), and were not invited to the AIAW Women's Basketball Tournament. After finishing 16–11 her second season, Head directed two 20-win teams, winning back-to-back AIAW Region-II championships. 1978 included the Lady Vols defeating 3-time AIAW champion Delta State by 20, and Tennessee's first number one ranking. 1978 saw the Lady Vols participate in their first AIAW Final Four, where they finished 3rd. Head also recorded her 100th win during this season, a 79–66 victory over NC State. Tennessee finished up the 1970s by winning the first ever SEC tournament, and returning to the Final Four, where they finished runner-up to Old Dominion, 68–53. =1980s= During the 1980–1981 season, the Lady Vols went 25–6, and avenged their championship game loss to Old Dominion by defeating them three times. The team made it to the AIAW Final Four for the third straight year, but wound up as runner-up for the second consecutive year, losing to Louisiana Tech, 79–59. The coach was now known as Pat Summitt, having married Tyler Summit II in 1980. The 1981–1982 season featured the first ever NCAA Women's basketball tournament. The Lady Vols were one of 32 teams invited and named a 2 seed in their region. In the region championship, the Lady Vols upset first seeded USC 91–90 in overtime to advance to the Final Four. They would lose their Final Four match-up with Louisiana Tech who ended up winning the tournament. The next season, the Lady Vols won the regular season SEC title, but fell in the SEC tournament to Georgia. Tennessee was invited to the now-36 team NCAA tournament and was given their first ever 1 seed. Tennessee made it to the regional championship, but fell to Georgia again, 67–63. Summitt won her 200th game on December 3, a 69–56 victory over St. John's during the Coca-Cola Classic in Detroit. The 1983–1984 season saw Tennessee start out poorly, 6–4. However, Summitt got her team together and finished 22–10, for her 8th straight 20-win season, a streak that is still on- going. Tennessee not only made it to the NCAA Final Four for the second time out of the three tournaments, but also made it to the title game. However, Tennessee lost by 11 to USC, who had also won the title the previous year. Pat Summitt earned Coach of the Year honors. This season was followed up by another 20-win year in which Tennessee earned both the regular season SEC title (despite only going 4–4) and the tournament title. However, the Lady Vols fell in the NCAA Tournament to Mississippi during the Round of 16. The next season was a similar story—the Lady Vols had a decent regular season, played a great tournament (reaching the Final Four for the second time in three years), but fell before winning the title. In 1986–1987, after years of trying, the Lady Vols finally broke through and defeated perennial power Louisiana Tech for their first title, 67–44. The Lady Techsters had defeated the Lady Vols by 12 earlier in the season. Tennessee's Tonya Edwards earned the honor of Most Outstanding Player in the Final Four. During this season, Summitt also earned her 300th win, an 87–66 victory over North Carolina. The next year, the Lady Vols were poised to repeat, as the third-ranked and top seeded Tennessee made it to the Final Four yet again. However, Louisiana Tech avenged their championship loss with a nine-point win, and went on to win the title. In 1988–1989, the Lady Vols made it to the Final Four for the fourth straight year, and as a one-seed for the second straight year. After dispatching Maryland by 12, Tennessee faced SEC rival Auburn for the title. Auburn had lost by two to Louisiana Tech in the title game the previous year, and had been given its only loss in the SEC Championship. However, that loss was to Tennessee, who managed a 15-point victory over the Tigers. The championship game was similar, and Tennessee took home its second title in three years with a 76–60 victory. Record-wise, this was Tennessee's best season yet, as they won 35 games while dropping only 2, one to Auburn in the regular season and the other a two-point loss to Texas. Additionally, the Lady Vols won every NCAA tournament game by at least twelve points. In the final season of the decade, the Lady Vols started off the season well, winning the SEC title. However, the team fell by one to Auburn in the SEC Championship, and then lost in overtime to Virginia in the regional finals, one game shy of making a trip to the Final Four, which was being held in Knoxville. Summitt did accomplish another milestone during this season, however—her 400th win, a 70–69 victory over South Carolina on January 25. =1990s= Despite winning neither the SEC regular season championship nor the tournament championship, Tennessee was given a 1 seed in the 1991 NCAA tournament. After a close win in the regional semifinals against Western Kentucky, Tennessee dispatched Auburn for the second time in three years. In the national semifinals, the Lady Vols beat Stanford, 68–60, to earn the opportunity to avenge the previous year's tournament loss against Virginia. Just as the prior year's game had gone into overtime, so did this one. Down one at the half, the Lady Vols managed to tie the game at 60 by the end of regulation. Tennessee escaped in overtime with a 70–67 win, and their third national title in five years. However, the next year the Lady Vols did not even make it to the regional championship, falling to the same Western Kentucky team they had beaten in the same round the previous tournament, 75–70. The 1992–93 season was better, as Tennessee defeated the defending champions Stanford twice, and swept the SEC season for the first time ever. However, the Lady Vols were unable to win the tournament title, and also fell in the NCAA tournament to Iowa, a 72–56 loss in the regional finals. Early in the 1993–1994 season, Summitt grabbed her 500th win, an 80–45 beating of Ohio State on November 21. Tennessee also won both the regular season and tournament conference titles. However, the streak of years without a Final Four appearance extended to three with a 71–68 loss in the regional semifinals to Louisiana Tech. The next season would be Tennessee's return to the Final Four. Tennessee ran the table in the SEC regular season for the third straight year, but also failed to win the tournament title for the third straight year. The top-seed Lady Vols breezed their way to their fifth national championship game, with no game being closer than 21. However, in the National Championship, the Lady Vols fell to the undefeated UConn Huskies, 70–64. During the off-season, Pat Summitt signed high school standout Chamique Holdsclaw. In 1995–1996, with freshman Holdsclaw and senior Michelle Marciniak, the Lady Vols won the SEC tournament and made a second straight Final Four. The other three teams: UConn, Stanford, and Georgia, had all defeated the Lady Vols in the regular season. In the semi-finals, facing the UConn Huskies who had knocked them off for the title the previous year, the Lady Vols shot out to an 11-point lead. However, UConn cut it to 4 by the half, and tied later on. With 12 seconds to go, Tennessee led by three, but the Huskies hit a three to send the game into overtime. This was not enough though, as UT prevailed by 5 in overtime. The championship game was not that close as Tennessee won their fourth title easily, an 83–65 win over Georgia. With regard to record, the 1996–1997 season was one of Summitt's worst seasons ever. In addition to losses to powerhouses such as Louisiana Tech (twice), Stanford, Old Dominion, and Connecticut, Tennessee also lost to teams such as Florida, against whom they had been previously undefeated. After their tenth loss of the season, in the SEC semi-finals to Auburn, the team pulled together in time for the NCAA Tournament. Avenging their loss to undefeated Connecticut, Tennessee continued on their way to the championship game, where they redressed another loss, defeating Old Dominion by 9 for their second straight national title. Summitt also earned her 600th win during the season, a 15-point victory over Marquette on November 23, 1996. In many aspects, the 1997–1998 team was Summitt's best. With the top-ranked recruiting class as well as Holdsclaw, the Lady Vols ran the table to a 39–0 season while playing one of the top-ranked schedules in the country. Only three teams came within 10 points of beating them, and the Lady Vols won a 93–75 victory over Louisiana Tech for their third straight national championship. Chamique Holdsclaw had declared that the 1998–99 team would be the greatest ever. However, this proved not to be the case. Injuries to several players decimated the team, and the Lady Vols ultimately fell to Duke in the regional finals. With this, the Chamique Holdsclaw era ended. A landmark was set during this season however, as \\"The Meeks\\"—Holdsclaw, Tamika Catchings, and Semeka Randall—became the first trio from one team to be named Kodak All-Americans. The Lady Vols ended the decade with their third straight 30-win season, third straight SEC title, and third straight SEC Tournament title. Additionally, the Lady Vols defeated UConn in the regular season, 72–71, in what would ultimately be the Huskies' only loss of the year. In the NCAA tournament, Tennessee breezed its way to the title game, winning all 5 games by at least ten points. However, in the championship the Lady Vols fell to the Huskies, by a 71–52 score. During the season, Summitt earned her 700th win, 85–62 at Wisconsin. At the 2000 ESPY Awards, the Lady Vols basketball team was named co-team of the decade, along with the Florida State Seminoles football team. Additionally, Pat Summitt was named the Naismith Coach of the Century, and Chamique Holdsclaw earned recognition as player of the century. =2000s= In the 2000–2001 season, the Lady Vols claimed another SEC title, winning all 14 SEC games. Additionally, they split the season series with the UConn Huskies and headed into the SEC tournament with a 28–1 record. However, the Lady Vols were upset by Vanderbilt in the semifinals, and then lost in the Sweet Sixteen to Xavier, their worst finish since 1993–1994. Despite this, Pat Summitt earned her 750th win, in the second game against UConn, a 92–88 victory. Additionally, the team finished with their fourth straight 30-win season. The 2001–2002 season marked the first time since the beginning of the rivalry that Tennessee and Connecticut played each other only once in the regular season. UConn won this match-up by 14. However they would see each other later in the tournament. Tennessee suffered other losses during the season, losing to Texas by a point and getting badly beaten by the Duke Blue Devils. Additionally, despite winning their fifth straight SEC championship, the Lady Vols fell once again in the tournament, this time to LSU. In the NCAA tournament, Tennessee was able to reach the Final Four yet again, with a 5-point win over Vanderbilt. This trip to the Final Four marked Summitt's 13th appearance, which broke Coach John Wooden's record of 12, as well as her 788th win, which tied her with Jody Conradt for winningest coach in women's basketball history. However, the Lady Vols fell in the national semifinals to Connecticut. This loss ended the season at 29–5, one win shy of extending Summitt's streak of 30-win seasons. Summitt did achieve more milestones during this season. A 106–66 win over USC marked her 200th win at home, a victory against Louisiana Tech was her 300th win against a ranked opponent and her 93–65 win over Arkansas was her 1,000th game as a coach, including international contests. During the 2002–2003 season, the Lady Vols compiled their 6th perfect SEC season, and additionally beat powerhouses Duke and Louisiana Tech among others. However, the Lady Vols dropped their second straight to Texas and lost yet another game in the series against UConn. This streak would continue as the Lady Vols made it to the title game only to lose to the Huskies again, 73–68. During the season, Summitt earned her 800th win, 76–57 over DePaul, and was the fastest coach to reach this milestone. The 2003–2004 season was quite similar to the previous year. The Lady Vols defeated most of their opponents, including Duke and Louisiana Tech, but dropped games to UConn and Texas. The Lady Vols again went 14–0 in the regular season against SEC competition and again fell in the tournament. And once again, the Lady Vols won five games in the NCAA tournament only to lose in the championship game to Connecticut. By 2004–2005, Connecticut's Diana Taurasi had finally graduated and Tennessee was able to break their losing streak against Connecticut with a 68–67 victory. As Taurasi left, Tennessee received Candace Parker, a highly regarded and nationally known player. However, due to injuries, she was redshirted and did not play that year. Tennessee suffered losses during the season to Duke, Rutgers, and LSU, while beating teams which included Stanford and Louisiana Tech. LSU's win over Tennessee gave the Tigers the SEC title, breaking Tennessee's streak of 7 straight. However Tennessee was able to break their streak of four years without a tournament title, by avenging their loss with a 67–65 victory over LSU in the SEC Championship. In the NCAA tournament, Tennessee defeated the Rutgers team which had beaten them earlier in the year to advance to their fourth Final Four in a row. In the Final Four, the Lady Vols fell to Michigan State by a mark of 68–64. Tennessee had led by 16 at one point, but the Spartans made a record-tying come back to advance to the title game. In the second round of the NCAA Tournament, the Lady Vols defeated Purdue. This victory gave Pat Summitt her 880th win, breaking North Carolina coach Dean Smith's record of 879 wins, making her the all-time winningest coach in NCAA history. 2005–2006 was Candace Parker's first year as a college athlete. After being redshirted the previous year she was recovered from her injuries and became a starter. During the season, the Lady Vols dropped three games to SEC foes LSU, Florida, and Kentucky, their worst SEC season since the 1996–1997 season. The Lady Vols also suffered a bad loss to Duke. However they won their second straight game against Connecticut and rebounded from the poor SEC season to win the tournament for the second year in a row. In the tournament, Tennessee controversially received a two seed instead of the one seed Summitt believed her team deserved, and in the regional finals played North Carolina. Parker tied Ivory Latta for leading scorer with 20 points, but it was not enough. Tennessee trailed from the beginning, falling behind by as many as 16. Late in the second half, the Lady Vols were able to cut the lead down to five, but ultimately fell, 75–63. This loss meant that for the first time in five years Summitt would not be appearing in the Final Four. Early in the 2006–2007 season, Tennessee defeated three ranked teams in a row, Stanford, Arizona State, and Middle Tennessee. After Tennessee lost to the North Carolina Tar Heels again, by 13, the Lady Vols defeated a strong Notre Dame team and defeated UConn for the third time in a row. In Knoxville, Summitt's team fell to top-ranked Duke, 74–70, in a game which Duke scored the first 19 points, with Tennessee not scoring for nearly the first six minutes. Later, in Baton Rouge, the Lady Vols clinched the SEC title against LSU in a game where Candace Parker scored 27. However, in the tournament semifinals, Tennessee fell to the Tigers. In that second game, Parker only scored 4 points. In the NCAA tournament, Summitt's team easily made it to the Final Four, dispatching teams that included SEC foe Mississippi and 13-seeded Cinderella, Marist, winning each game by at least 14. In the Final Four, Tennessee again faced North Carolina. Despite shooting just 27%, the team came back from a 12-point deficit with 8:18 remaining to win, 56–50. In the championship game against Rutgers, Tennessee finally won its seventh title. Down by 11 at the half, Rutgers mounted a small comeback, taking the lead down to 7 with 13:33, only to have Shannon Bobbitt hit three three-pointers. Rutgers responded with a 7–0 run, cutting the lead down to 8, but Parker hit 6 free throws to ice the win for Tennessee. 2008 national championship, are honored at the White House by President George W. Bush on June 24, 2008. The 2007–08 season started off with the top-ranked Lady Vols going 3–0, including wins over 9th-ranked Oklahoma and 22nd-ranked Texas. The win over Texas was Summitt's 950th. After two more wins, #1 Tennessee knocked off fourth-ranked North Carolina, 83–79, in a rematch of a Final Four match-up last year, to advance to 6–0 on the season. Tennessee won their next four games, then headed out to California for a match-up with 5th-ranked Stanford. Down 4 with less than 30 seconds remaining, the Lady Vols managed to tie the game up and send it to overtime, but still lost, 73–69. The Lady Vols responded by winning their next seven games, giving them a 17–1 record going into a match-up with Duke. Candace Parker's 17 points and 12 rebounds, including a bucket with 22 seconds remaining, helped the Lady Vols defeat the Blue Devils for the first time in four years, 67–64. After winning their next three games, all against SEC opponents, the Lady Vols met with a top-5 Rutgers squad who had just defeated top-ranked UConn. Down 5 with under 90 seconds remaining, the Lady Vols hit back-to-back threes pointers to regain the lead, but Rutgers' Carson responded with a jumper to give Rutgers a one-point lead. On the other end, Candace Parker missed a shot with time winding down. Tennessee's Nicky Anosike got the rebound and was fouled, sending her to the free throw line where she made both free throws to give Tennessee a one-point victory. However, the finish proved to be controversial, as replays revealed that the game clock had paused with 0.2 seconds remaining, giving Anosike enough time to be fouled. In the following game, against LSU, Tennessee soared out to a 21–2 lead, but led only 33–30 at halftime. In the second half, the Lady Tigers took a quick lead, and never looked back, winning 78–62. Tennessee won the remainder of its regular season games and finished second in the SEC, giving them a first-round bye in the conference tournament. The Lady Vols went on to win the SEC tournament, defeating LSU.(61–55) Tennessee advanced to their 18th Final Four, defeating LSU by only one point to advance to a second consecutive NCAA Tournament Championship Game. The Lady Vols defeated the 2-seeded Stanford Cardinal 64–48 to take home their 8th National Championship. In 2009 the team had a rebuilding season, due to the departure of the first pick in the 2008 WNBA Draft Candace Parker. They finished the season at 22–11 and entered the NCAA tournament with the lowest seeding in the program's history at #5. In the opening round of the tournament they played a 26–8 Ball State Cardinals team that was making their NCAA tourney debut. Ball State would go on to win the game 71–55 making history. The Lady Volunteers had never lost in the first two rounds of the tournament, going 42–0 through the years. Tennessee also became the first defending champ to lose its opening game in the women's tourney. =2010s= On April 18, 2012, Head Coach Pat Summitt announced that she would be stepping down as coach but remain with the team as a head coach emeritus following her 38 years with the team and recent diagnosis of dementia. Assistant Coach Holly Warlick was announced to be moving up to fill the head coaching position for the Lady Vols Basketball team. The Lady Vols earned their 17th SEC Tournament Championship as they defeated Kentucky 71–70 on March 9, 2014. On March 27, 2019, Warlick was fired. On April 9, Kellie Harper was hired as head coach.

At the time, children requiring specialist education were expected to travel to England. In 1860, Rose began teaching pupils in a small house in Windsor, a suburb of Melbourne, however the number of students continued to grow, causing the location to change several times.

His most notable service was as Admiral Adam Duncan's flag captain on board HMS Venerable during the Battle of Camperdown on 11 October 1797. Life William was born in Bagshot, the eldest son of Joseph Fairfax of the Horse Guards and Mary Anne. He married firstly Hannah Spears (d.1770) in 1767, and secondly in 1772, Janet Margaret Charters. William was the father of eight children. His daughter, Mary Somerville was a noted science writer and polymath. Career He joined the Royal Navy in 1750 aboard HMS Centurion, under Admiral First Lord Augustus Keppel, later moving to HMS Mars, HMS Garland and HMS Duke.He was commissioned a lieutenant on 20 December 1757, and later served on HMS Eurus off North America. He was in reserve between 1760 and 1766 and again between 1769 and 1776 with a brief break aboard HMS Greyhound and at the start of the American Revolutionary War he returned to service but was captured by the French in August 1778 and spent the rest of the war (1775-1783) as a prisoner of war. In 1782 Fairfax was released as a post captain and briefly commanded HMS Tartar. In 1790 he took command of HMS Sheerness and in 1796 became flag captain of HMS Venerable under Admiral Adam Duncan and was heavily engaged at the Battle of Camperdown the following year. For his service in the battle, Fairfax was knighted and in 1801 was made a rear-admiral serving in the Baltic Sea but had made an enemy of Lord Spencer and was permanently placed in reserve. In 1810 he was promoted to Vice-Admiral of the Red and died in Edinburgh in 1813.

McComas taught Vocational Agriculture in the 1950s and later served as head of the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education at New Mexico State University from 1966 to 1967; dean of the College of Education, at Kansas State University, from 1967 to 1969; and dean of the College of Education at University of Tennessee from 1969 to 1975 when he was named president of Mississippi State.https://web.archive.org/web/20131105114957/http://www.president.vt.edu/presidents/presidents.html#mccomas President of Virginia Tech McComas was hired to guide Virginia Tech back into smooth waters after the fallout from a controversial land deal and an athletic scandal led to the resignation of William Edward Lavery. He assumed his new duties on September 1, 1988. From the beginning of his administration, McComas placed major emphasis on undergraduate education. He kept an open-door policy for students, personally visited over 4,500 of them in the residence halls, and advised 16. He established the Center for Excellence in Teaching and the Academic Advising Center; bolstered the honors program; saw that food in the dining halls was improved; created an Office of the Dean of Students; began planning a student recreation and fitness center; established commencement ceremonies at the end of fall semester; and developed EXPO, a “road show” of information about Virginia Tech for high school students throughout the commonwealth. He also established incentives to draw more National Merit Scholars to Virginia Tech, moving the university into the nation’s top 20 in the number of merit scholars it attracted. McComas had been in office only a year when the state learned that its projected revenues had been vastly overestimated, and Gov. L. Douglas Wilder ordered severe funding cuts to higher education to balance the budget. Cuts to Virginia Tech alone in the 1990-92 biennium totaled $37 million (general fund reductions 1990-96 totaled $46.7 million, but the university was able to offset $16 million, principally by raising tuition). As Virginia dropped to 43rd in the country in state funding for higher education, McComas publicly decried the assault on higher education, resulting in strained relations with Wilder. The cuts forced the university to hold numerous faculty positions vacant for a period of time; 49 classified staff members lost their jobs, but the university was able to reassign 25 of them to other positions. On the positive side, the Norfolk Southern Corporation gave Hotel Roanoke to the university in 1989. McComas, who had played a leading role in forging stronger ties with the City of Roanoke, directed Virginia Tech as it worked with Roanoke leaders to raise approximately $50 million to renovate the century-old hotel, build an adjacent conference center, and make road and pedestrian-access improvements in the adjacent area. The president placed special emphasis on Tech’s traditional land-grant role of outreach and service, established a Public Service Division, and appointed an acting vice president for public service. Later, he created the position of vice provost for outreach and international programs and hired the university’s first black vice provost. He led the effort to make the university a force in economic development, helped form the New Century Council to create a strategic vision for the region, and initiated a series of public service forums throughout the state. He worked with town officials to bring a national Family Motor Coach Association convention and the Tour DuPont to Blacksburg to boost regional economic development. On campus he stressed the importance of community and emphasized the value of all employees to the operation of the university. He supported an overhaul of the university’s governance structure and the inclusion of classified staff in that structure. He encouraged diversity—minority student enrollment increased 26 percent in 1990—and supported the appointment of minorities and women to administrative positions. He oversaw the reorganization of athletics and the recruitment of an academic advising coordinator for athletes, transferred operations of the Alumni Association to the university’s administrative system, and placed administration of Virginia Cooperative Extension under the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. During his tenure, research spending reached $125 million, the school of forestry became Tech’s ninth college, U.S. News & World Report ranked Tech in the top 50 national universities, Tech joined the Big East football conference, McComas established the Presidential Award for Excellence to recognize outstanding classified staff members, Tech joined the town and C&P; Telephone Company in unveiling the Blacksburg Electronic Village, and serious planning began for a \\"smart\\" highway between Blacksburg and Roanoke. Additionally, the university raised $17 million in a campaign for athletic scholarships and facilities and initiated the Campaign for Virginia Tech to raise $250 million by 1998. State voters approved a $472-million bond issue, which included $46 million for construction at Virginia Tech (McComas had campaigned heavily for the bond issue). The university secured final federal funding for a biotechnology center, and the Virginia Tech Foundation purchased facilities in Switzerland to house a new international studies center. In 1991 a flash flood left over $4 million in damages, principally to the Donaldson Brown Center and War Memorial Gym, spurring a much-needed renovation of the center, which was renamed Donaldson Brown Hotel & Conference Center. Payne Hall, the first new residence hall built on the Virginia Tech campus in more than a decade, and the first to offer air conditioning was completed in 1993. The university also began charging faculty and staff to park on campus, as required by the state, and improved campus accessibility, as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act. On September 28, 1993, McComas, diagnosed the week before with colon cancer, announced that he was stepping down immediately to begin chemotherapy and would resign effective January 1, 1994. In December 1993 the board adopted a resolution to present McComas with the Ruffner Medal. He died on February 10, 1994. Early Life and Education McComas was born December 23, 1928, in Prichard, West Virginia. He received his bachelor’s degree in Agricultural education from West Virginia University in 1951; and earned a master’s in 1960 and Ph. D. in education in 1962, both from Ohio State University. He Married Adele Stoltz of Gouverneur, New York, on May 10, 1961; they had two children.https://web.archive.org/web/20131105114957/http://www.president.vt.edu/presidents/presidents.html#mccomas Honors McComas Hall at Mississippi State, which is home of the Department of Communication and the University Art Gallery, is named in his honor.

The river Sjoa gives its name to the valley. Sjodalen is generally accepted to start at the outlet from the deep mountain-lake Gjende. The valley's lower end-point is, however less defined as the valley is named Heidal east of Randsverk. Perhaps the most easy definition is to state that the valley draining Sjoa is named Sjodalen in Vågå and Heidal in Sel municipalities. History Scene From Sjodalen Roald Tvedt (2008) The valley was traditionally used for summer farming. What is particular for the valley is the size and state of these summer farms (sæter in Norwegian). This is partly caused by the very rare tradition of winter-farming in this region. Rather than bringing the summer harvest down into the village and main farm, the farmers took the animals back up into the mountains during winter. This could be done due to the limited snow-fall in this continental climate regime. The perhaps best-known tourist site in Sjodalen itself is Ridderspranget. This canyon's name means Knight's Leap and originated with the legend of Sigvat Kvie from Valdres, one of the King Haakon Magnusson's knights (riddar). Sigvat jumped across the river Sjoa at this narrow point in the canyon, with a beautiful girl from Vågå. He had freed her from Ivar Gjesling successfully taking his love to Valdres.Ridderspranget (Store norske leksikon) Geography In the valley-floor and low valley sides the landscape is dominated by pine, the highest pine-forest of Norway. Above the pine-forest and 150 m wide birch-zone before the alpine bush-vegetations leads into the higher mountains. The western side of Sjodalen is defined by the Jotun nappe, the escarpment that define the Jotunheimen National Park and these mountains reach above 2000 m above sea level. The river Sjoa feeds two lakes on its progress down the valley: Øvre Sjodalsvatnet and Nedre Sjodalsvatnet. The Sjoa river is a popular place for fishing, rafting, and kayaking. Sjoa river is protected, as is the landscape surrounding the river. Restrictions are therefore set on camping near the river. Several traditional places to spend the night exists, including Randsverk camping, Hindsæter, Bessheim, Maurvangen and Gjendesheim.

Plot summary On a local moon of Talin IV, a Federation first contact observation post is monitoring the events on the planet below with growing confusion and concern. Talin IV, a world inhabited by a reptilian society with a culture equivalent to late-20th century Earth, and possible first contact prospect for the Federation in the near future, is now a world divided. The two principal nation states of the planet have become increasingly paranoid and in danger of instigating a nuclear war. Provocations seem to be coming from each side, although both sides deny any intrusions into enemy space. Each nation's heightened security has made the UFP First Contact Office's work much harder, as detection has become more likely. Further complicating matters, Talin scientists have been researching naturally occurring dilithium crystals that may be capable of sensing the advanced subspace signals used by the galactic community. While the discovery of an interplanetary culture would allow for contact with the Federation, it is also possible the Talin will destroy themselves before they make that historic leap. To avoid accidentally revealing their presence and possibly affecting the delicate political situation, the Talin system is locked down by the First Contact Office, so no use of subspace or warp drive is permitted near the planet. While preparing for their mission, James T. Kirk, Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy discuss the similar situation that faced Earth. To determine whether or not the First Contact Office has been discovered, Kirk and a joint USS Enterprise/First Contact Office team beam down to the planet at one point, narrowly escaping detection. Soon after, Kirk prevents an accidental nuclear detonation from erupting into full-scale nuclear war. Afterward, Kirk convenes a board of inquiry on his own actions, and it is determined that he acted to prevent what was most likely a computer error from destroying a world. However, shortly after the inquiry, all the planet's nuclear arsenals are fired at their targets at once. The Enterprise is crippled when an intercontinental ballistic missile warhead explodes nearby. The fact that the missile targets the Enterprise is seemingly conclusive proof that Kirk's actions have not only revealed the existence of his ship, but that his prior intervention has also prevented the Talin culture from learning the lessons needed to prevent nuclear self-destruction. Kirk and the other senior officers (with the exception of Scotty, who was not on the bridge at the time) are blamed for the destruction of Talin civilization, attributed to their supposed violation of Starfleet's Prime Directive (hence the title of the book), and either resign from Starfleet, are demoted to ensign, or in Uhura's case, court-martialed and dishonorably discharged. Although they are separated, Kirk's crew do not give up individual efforts to return and establish what went wrong at Talin. Kirk, under assumed aliases, works his way across space as laborer and cargo chief. Sulu and Chekov join up with an Orion smuggler and slave trader in order to steal his ship. Uhura and McCoy join forces and purchase a space craft and create a fictitious identity for McCoy, the feared pirate \\"Black Ire.\\" On Earth, Spock joins forces with a radical student group that advocates the elimination of the Prime Directive. Through manipulation of the students, the Vulcan embassy and the by-laws of the Federation, Spock arranges for two Talin astronauts (one from each of the two Talin superpowers) who escaped before the planet's destruction, to speak before the Federation Council as ambassadors for their planet, and request the Federation's help. Through various means, Spock, Kirk and the other senior Enterprise officers rendezvous with Scotty (who has been working feverishly to refurbish the nearly-destroyed Enterprise) at the now-closed observation post on Talin's moon. It is revealed that the nations of Talin IV were manipulated into attacking each other by insect-like drones of a planet-sized creature called the \\"One,\\" which is slowly approaching Talin IV. The drones (called the \\"Many\\") were sent to prepare Talin IV for consumption by the One. The drones inadvertently fomented the nuclear exchange by their efforts to create conditions on the planets' surface conducive to the growth of the algae that is the One's food. Ultimately, a gas giant planet in the Talin system is substituted for Talin IV as the One's new food source, sparing Talin IV without destroying the One. Kirk and the other senior officers are restored to full rank and resume their duty stations on the Enterprise. Kirk lands on the surface of the planet with an away team, which begins reviving billions of Talin who have survived by going into hibernation.

From 1989 to 1994, Kangaroo Island Sealink was owned by the Malaysian company MBF. In 1994 the company was sold to a consortium of staff members and Kangaroo Island residents. SeaLink's two currently operating ferries, Sealion 2000 and Spirit of Kangaroo Island, cross Backstairs Passage from Cape Jervis to Penneshaw in about 45 minutes, up to 10 times daily. SeaLink had acquired the previous ferry service founded by Peter March. Its first vessel was Philanderer 3, the first of March's vessels to carry vehicles. In later years, the company operated the Island Navigator (purchased 1990), also a car carrying ferry, as the designated freight and fuel carrier. SeaLink has outlasted several competing companies since it began operations. Boat Torque, a Western Australian company, operated Superflyte from 1994 until 1997, whilst Kangaroo Island Ferries had a short-lived venture with SeaWay, from September 2004 until February 2005. Under different ownership, SeaWay recommenced services in August 2007, before its operations were suspended in May 2008 and an administrator appointed shortly thereafter. SeaLink holds a virtual monopoly on oversea transport, primarily due to its long term lease of the Cape Jervis berth. SeaLink's agreement with the Government of South Australia, expiring in 2024, precludes other operators from utilising the Cape Jervis facility for one hour before, and one hour after any scheduled SeaLink service. Kangaroo Island residents have expressed displeasure with the exclusive arrangement granted to SeaLink. SeaLink had state government subsidies with respect to its freight charges, which ended in 2003.

He served from January 1, 1975 to December 31, 1987. Born in Geneseo, New York, he earned his bachelor's degree from Michigan State University, his master’s in public administration from George Washington University, and his doctorate in extension administration from the University of Wisconsin. He began his professional career as a teacher and coach at Clarence Central High School in Clarence, New York, before serving two years in the Army. He began working for the federal Extension Service’s Division of Management Operations in 1956, where he remained until 1966 when he joined the Virginia Cooperative Extension Service as director of administration. He later served as vice president for finance from 1968 to 1973 and executive vice president from 1973 to 1975. During his tenure as president, Lavery emphasized research, and expenditures in support of research totaled more than $70.2 million by fiscal year 1987, moving the university into the top 50 research institutions in the nation. He enhanced research opportunities by initiating the Corporate Research Center (CRC) and Virginia Tech Intellectual Properties (VTIP). During his 12-year term, the first two buildings were begun at the center and two more were planned. The CRC received an antenna to link Virginia Tech to the world via satellite, and the Extension division developed a series of 26 downlink sites throughout the state. Installation began on a new communication system for the campus, the university purchased a supercomputer, and the first proposal was developed for what later became the Blacksburg Electronic Village. Lavery placed a high priority on alleviating shortages of classroom, laboratory, and office space, and during his term the total inventory of available space increased by 50.1 percent. A $108 million construction program during his presidency included additions to Newman Library and the War Memorial Gymnasium and construction of Litton Reaves Hall, Johnston Student Center and a new dormitory to house 333 students with an attached dining facility, Cochrane Hall. Another $17.5 million funded a complex to house the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, which was established during his presidency and opened to students in 1980. Lavery hired the university’s first vice president for development, Charles Forbes, who launched a campaign to raise $50 million — then raised more than $118 million. Large contributions during his presidency included gifts from John Lee Pratt of $11 million to support engineering and agricultural programs and Marion Bradley Via of $3 million to establish the Harvey W. Peters Research Center and $5 million each to support the departments of civil engineering and electrical engineering. Robert B. Pamplin Sr. and Robert Pamplin Jr. gave $10 million to support the College of Business. Assets of the Virginia Tech Foundation grew from $6.2 million to $140.1 million during his term. Lavery joined the faculty at Virginia Tech in 1966 as director of administration for the Extension division before being tapped as vice president for finance in 1968. In 1973, he became executive vice president, and he was appointed president in 1974, effective January 1, 1975. During his presidency, he received numerous honors and awards. Among them, the National Conference of Christians and Jews presented him with the Brotherhood Award, the governor of Virginia appointed him to serve on the Commission on Virginia’s Transportation in the 21st Century, United States President Ronald Reagan named him chair of the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD) where he served for three years and was later succeeded by Wales H. Madden Jr, and the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury appointed him to the National Savings Bond Committee, where he chaired the Higher Education Industry Campaign. Desperate for additional farmland for the support of teaching, research, and extension programs in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Virginia Tech acquired Kentland Farm on December 31, 1986. Virginia Tech secretly traded about 250 acres of research orchards adjacent to a commercial area that would soon become Christiansburg's main shopping district to a group of developers for the historic 1,785-acre Kentland property. The developers on the other end of the swap, one of whom was a former Tech athletics official, quickly sold 40 acres of the former university farmland for $2.7 million. News of the land swap, and especially the fact that it was done behind closed doors, sparked outrage. Lavery developed a reorganization plan for the troubled Athletic Department that had been rocked by a scandal involving alleged recruiting violations, mismanagement of funds and the bitter departure of two athletic directors in less than a year that resulted in a rebuke from Governor of Virginia, Gerald Baliles. Frank Beamer was hired to replace Bill Dooley as head football coach, but with negative publicity continuing to swirl within and around the university, he announced his resignation on October 16, 1987, effective December 31, 1987, to prevent polarization of the campus. After stepping down as president on December 31, 1987, Lavery continued to serve the university, first as honorary chancellor, then as the William B. Preston Professor of International Affairs. After his retirement on Aug. 1, 1991, he was named president emeritus. The university recognized his contributions by presenting him with the Ruffner Medal in 1993 and in 1995 he was named an honorary alumnus of Virginia Tech. Additionally, the Class of 1997 named its class ring in his honor. Family Lavery married the former Peggy Johnson of Pawnee City, Nebraska in 1956; the couple had four children. Legacy and Honors The William E. Lavery Animal Health Research Center at the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of veterinary Medicine was named in his honor in 1995, Lavery Hall, the Academic and Student Affairs Building at Virginia Tech was named for William E. Lavery in 2012. It includes two floors of dining in a facility called Turner Place, one floor of classrooms, and space for the Services for Students with Disabilities office.

Early life and training He was born in Rome to Pietro and Maria Agnelletti; his father worked for the Giustiniani family. This helped him access in 1837 to studies at the Accademia San Luca of Rome. His first masters were a painter by the name of Delicati and G. Silvagni, who taught design at the academy. He entered the studio of Tommaso Minardi from 1842 to 1850. There he worked alongside Guglielmo De Sanctis, Cesare Fracassini, Nicola Consoni, and Cesare Marianecci. One of his works were displayed at the Universal Exposition in London of 1851. His work was influenced by works of Ingres and the Nazarene movement, but also by Francesco Hayez's interest in genre depiction, and which differed from the more academic style of Vincenzo Cammuccini. Mariani painted a portrait for the Monument to Cardinal R. Fornari (1855, Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome). Mature work His easel paintings gave him a good degree of success. He moved into a room in the Palazzo Dovizielli on Via Margutta. Sharing the flat were painter Bernardo Celentano and Fracassini. Here he painted Sappho (1858), followed by The Diviner, Astrologer in the act of Divination, and a Music Lesson exhibited in the 1861 Universal Exhibition in Florence. Mainardi gained commissions in frescoes for many churches and palaces in Rome, Lazio, Umbria and finally in the Marche and Abruzzo. For example, he helped complete the decoration (1857–1860) for the rebuilt basilica of San Paolo fuori le Mura, working on Paul laying on of hands on Barnabas in Antioch and The Magician Elymas in Pafo del Sud. His also worked on the decoration of the church of Santa Maria in Monticelli, restored by the architect Francesco Azzurri. Mariani entirely frescoed the vault with Christian heroines, the presbytery with Christ and Christ teaches children between the crowds in the hall of the temple, the wall above the organ with Moses and the burning bush, Jacob's Dream, the choir with Saint Cecilia in the midst of a choir of angels, painted in monochrome on a design by Minardi. In 1862 he moved to Arpino to decorate the ceiling of the Palazzo Sangermano, with a fresco depicting Chariot of Venus with some nymphs, for which he was paid 200 scudi. In 1863, he married Virginia Barlocci, herself a painter and ceramist, widow of the painter Bernardino Riccardi, and by September of the same year he was appointed academic of merit in the Accademia di San Luca. In 1865, he completed frescoes for the church of Santa Maria in Aquiro, during its restoration by G. Morichini between 1861 and 1866. Here he painted three octagons with angels in the ceiling, with evangelists and angels on the pendents. He also painted the four Doctors of the Church on pillars of the nave and the Eternal Father on a gold background in the dome.Mariani, Cesare by Silvia Silvestri, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 70 (2007) In 1868, he became a member of the Artistic Commission for Roman Copperplate Engraving. After the death of Cesare Fracassini, Mariani, along with Francesco Grandi, and Coghetti, were asked to complete the fresco decoration of the newly rebuilt Basilica of San Lorenzo fuori le Mura. He painted a Martyrdom and Burial of St Stephen, both destroyed during the bombing of 1943 (the Martyrdom was reproduced in 1920 by G. Fantoni of Gemona on the vault of the parish of San Stefano in San Stino of Livenza).Enciclopedia treccani He helped decorate the Sanctuary of Santa Maria Auxilium Christianorum Trevi, near Montefalco in Umbria.Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti, by Angelo de Gubernatis. Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, page 279. On the vault, he painted Apostles, Prophets, Patriarchs and Sibyls, in the pendentives, Heroines of the Bible and a Coronation of the Virgin in the apse. The altarpieces of the sanctuary were painted by Pollastrini and Overbeck. In 1870, he worked with Domenico Bruschi in frescos for the Palazzo della Consulta in Rome. He completed the figures of Geometry and Dialectic for the monument of the Roman Cemetery of Verano. He completed an altarpiece of the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple for a cycle of paintings about the mysteries of the Rosary for the Cathedral in Santiago, Chile. He frescoed the walls and painted the altarpiece (1870) for the Chapel of St Matthew in the church of Santo Stefano del Cacco. He also frescoed (1870–74) the cupola, lunettes of the counterfacade, and the chapel of the Crucifix of the church of Santa Maria di Loreto alla Colonna Traiana. He decorated in the oratory of the Merchants at the Convent of the Gesù, and painted a St Bridget between the windows of the nave of Santa Maria in Trastevere (1872). He painted frescoes for the Chapel of the Madonna in San Salvatore in Onda (1875–76), and the ceiling of Sant' Omobono (1877), the nave and chancel in San Giuseppe dei Falegnami near the Mamertine Jail, restored by A. Parisi (1880–83), and finally he painted two panels in San Rocco Ripetta (1885). In 1887 he painted a Japanese Martyrs crucified in 1597 in Nagasaki for the church of San Antonio di Padua on Via Merulana. He also painted two versions of this painting for the School of Giovanni Battista de la Salle (1887–88) and contributed to the cycles of frescoes for the Cathedral of St. Emidio at Ascoli Piceno (1884–91) and for the shrine of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Teramo. In Teramo, he also painted a triptych depicting the Virgin Enthroned with Saints Francis and Anne for the Savini chapel, and decorated the palace city of the same family.Website of Cathedral of Sant'Emidio In 1878, he won a contest to paint the main Hall of the Finance Ministry, where he depicted an allegory of the Unity of Italy with Illustrious Men of Past and Present. He lost a competition to Maccari to paint the So-called Yellow Hall of the Senate; Maccari went on to paint his masterpiece Cicero Denounces Catiline. He painted frescoes for a number of Roman palaces including the Marignoli and Bobrinski. Mariani gave drawing lessons to the Prince of Naples Vittorio Emanuele and was commissioned to paint a frieze in the Royal apartments of the Palazzo Quirinale. He also painted a canvas about the Kingship being offered to Emanuele Filiberto, which was sent to the International Exhibition of Rome in 1883. He completed paintings for the chapel of San Giovanni Miani. For Santa Lucia del Gonfalone, he painted frescoes with three scenes: The Vision of St Bonaventure, Pope Sixtus V blesses the Redeemed Barbary Slaves, and The oath of Giovanni Cerrone. In 1867, he was commissioned by Signore Baldini Giustiniani to paint frescoes at the Castello at Rocca di Lanciano, depicting Aurora and the Chariot of the Sun. He continued the inveterate tradition of Italian religious frescoes with work at the Cathedral of Ascoli Piceno, the church of Madonna delle Grazie in the city of Teramo in the region of Abruzzo Description of church of Madonna delle Grazie in Teramo. and the churches of Santa Maria del Suffragio and Santo Stefano del Cacco. Cesare's style owes as much to the Italian heritage as to modern pre-raphaelite styles; in effect, his work at Sant' Emidio, named for a 4th-century saint, is striking for its faith that art could revitalize a hagiography that was waning in a secularizing Italy. Awards and teaching roles In May 1870, he was appointed as Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by Pope Pius IX. After just over a year, July 30, 1871, he was appointed Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy, and in 1872 the Emperor Pedro II of Brazil awarded him the Cross of the Order of the Rose. In 1870, he became a member of Academies of Fine Arts of many cities in Italy, including Perugia, Florence, Milan, Urbino, Carrara, Orvieto, and Ravenna. He was also named to the council than of Fine Arts of the Ministry of Public Education. In 1872, the city council of Rome sent Mariani to National Art Exhibition in Milan, and in 1873, he was on the jury of the World Exhibition in Vienna with Filippo Palizzi. From 1888 to 1890 he was president of the Accademia di San Luca. The last official task of the artist was to participate in 1896 in the juried competition, \\"Per una memoria sulla tecnica dei dipinti\\", launched by the Ministry of Education public, replacing Francesco Jacovacci. He was reduced to inactivity in 1898, the same year of the death of his wife, and died in Rome on February 21, 1901.

A thousand years ago, the water level was ten feet lower, making these creatures far more abundant there. Geography The island measures about , which yields an area of less than three hectares.

The quarry has been used intermittently since then, making the island less visible; to make up for that, a fifteen-foot marker was erected on its peak.

It was the family home of firearm manufacturer Samuel Colt. Armsmear was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1976; this designation was expanded in 2008 to form the Coltsville Historic District, a National Historic Landmark District. History Armsmear was planned for Colt's 1856 marriage to Elizabeth Hart Jarvis, and constructed in 1856 to designs by an unknown architect, possibly local architect Octavius Jordan or factory engineer H. A. G. Pomeroy, on grounds overlooking the recently completed Colt Armory. It was described by a contemporary thus: \\"an Italian villa in stone, massive, noble, refined, yet not carrying out any decided principle of architecture, it is like its originator, bold and unusual in its combinations.\\" It features a low-pitched roof, heavy bracketed cornice, round-arched doors and windows, iron balconies, Italianate tower and details, and Turkish domes and pinnacles. The Colts occupied Armsmear in 1857 and promptly began to develop its gardens. Landscape architects Cleveland and Copeland provided the plans. Unusual, glass-domed conservatories, inspired by London's Crystal Palace, were added in 1861-1862. Ultimately the estate contained some of greenhouses, as well as ponds, fountains, and a deer park. The house and manicured grounds were the primary residence of Samuel Colt and his family. The Colts entertained lavishly at the estate, holding large parties that were the highlight of the Hartford society season. Samuel Colt lived in Armsmear for approximately 5 years from 1857 until his death in 1862. He was buried on the grounds of Armsmear near the graves of Sam and Elizabeth's young children, amidst a copse of weeping willows known as the 'Grove of Graves.' Following her husband's death, Elizabeth Hart Colt and her son Caldwell Hart Colt lived together in the large home for several decades. In 1894, Elizabeth had Samuel Colt and four of their children buried at Armsmear reinterred to Cedar Hill Cemetery. After Elizabeth Colt died in 1905, the house was converted to a home for Episcopal women (in 1911) under the terms of her will. The residential community to this day is administrated by the Colt Trust. She also gave of Armsmear's grounds to create Hartford's Colt Park. The city has subsequently replaced the greenhouse, garden, and ponds with ball fields and a skating rink.

It had a population of 6,450 at the time of the 2005 census. History In La Loma there is an archaeological site dating from the Bronze Age. The district derives its name from the Lugar Nuevo de los Canónigos, a place of residence for the canons of Orihuela cathedral, which once had power over the area. In 1701, after some lawsuits with the settlers, the church made some allowances which permitted the foundation of Bigastro, starting with three estates, in which 24 families lived. Economy At the time of its foundation, agriculture was concentrated around flax and hemp; in the 19th century, the fall of the textile sector sparked interest in citrus fruits and products from irrigated fields. There is also industrial activity, mainly in the form of construction and manufacturing. Demography In 2005, Bigastro had 6,450 residents, 11.79% of which were foreigners. The most common nationality was British (22% of all foreigners). Monuments The young age of the town means that some landlord's homes survive, along with some farmer's dwellings dispersed throughout the area. One unique monument that must be mentioned is the Church of the Virgin of Bethlehem, where a sculpture of Saint Joachim of Salzillo.

From its opening in 1891 until its closure on 30 June 1971 and subsequent demolition, the hotel was considered \\"the best-known hotel in Australia\\", \\"the premier hotel in Sydney\\"Sunday Times, Sydney, NSW, 2 July 1916 p.25. and described itself as \\"The Hotel of the Commonwealth\\".Sydney Harbour Bridge Official Souvenir & Programme, NSW Government Printer, 1932, p.128 The hotel was situated in one of Sydney's important thoroughfares in the heart of the city. Opening The foundation stone was laid by Sir Henry Parkes in 1889, and the opening of the new establishment was performed two years later by Sarah Bernhardt, whose name was first in the new hotel's register, subsequently displayed in a glass showcase in the main foyer. The Sydney Morning Herald reported \\"French actress Sarah Bernhardt arrived in Sydney, bringing with her 100 pieces of luggage. As hundreds of fans flooded onto Redfern railway platform as her train approached, she was whisked away from the platform to the Australia Hotel where hundreds more excited fans wanted to catch a glimpse of the glamorous celebrity. Her expensive flower filled 2nd floor suite played host to pets including a large St Bernard, a smaller pug dog, a native bear and several cages containing possums and parrots. Theatergoers, many of whom had paid up to £2 for a seat, were genuinely moved by Mme Bernhardt's performance in Dumas' La Dame aux Camillias at Her Majesty's Theatre. After the show, drama critics called her a 'woman of genius' saying she had held the audience spell bound.\\" Next to the hotel, across Rowe Street, stood the famous Theatre Royal. Architecture Martin Place in the 1950s. The building on the corner to the left is the Commercial Travellers Club Building and the 'modern' twin-wings of the Australia Hotel next to it were demolished in 1971-2 to make way for the MLC Centre. The hotel had a large entrance onto Castlereagh Street in polished granite, the stairs grey and white marble, the doric columns red. The squared columns in the entrance foyer were imported Italian marble, and the magnificent neo-classical staircase which led from the main foyer to the first floor was completely in multi-coloured Carrara marble. From that floor to the 10th a massive carved and highly polished mahogany Victorian grand staircase, with stained glass windows, led to their rooms those guests, who, in the early days of lifts, still preferred to walk. The first floor contained a pillared corridor with various reception rooms, in addition to the Winter Garden - \\"famous for its morning and afternoon teas, light luncheons, and theatre suppers\\", and the Moorish Lounge, leading to the huge dining room - the Emerald Room, with its highly decorated ceiling some above the guests, Italian chandeliers, and a dais at the west end containing a white marble operating fountain and other statues, engulfed in palm court style shrubbery. In the late 1920s an extension was constructed to the north of the main hotel which fronted onto the city's historic Martin Place. A highlight of this block was its circular art deco black glass staircase. A small branch of department store David Jones Limited was located in the hotel, which provided goods for visitors, hampers for sending to Great Britain and Australiana souvenirs. The hotel also contained a number of very fine paintings of Australian scenes including eight watercolours by the famous artist, Gladstone Eyre. Standards The hotel boasted international standards of comfort and service. The Australia became \\"the place to stay and be seen by the upper echelons of society\\".http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/33522593?q=Australia+Hotel%2C+Sydney&c;=picture&versionId;=41205345 The hotel remained an oasis for those who scorned modernity and sought the more refined atmosphere of the classic European hotels. Apart from the accommodation for guests, rooms were also provided in the Rowe Street wing for their servants, including the children's nurses, who had their own dining room with their charges. Robert Helpmann had a suite permanently reserved; Marlene Dietrich stayed there several times (thereafter her suite, rooms 707–708, was named after her) and one lady lived there for 31 years. Notable events A patron stands on the marble steps of the doomed Hotel Australia. The closure notice is pasted on a column. The hotel hosted many famous events. * The hotel was the venue for the first meeting for the establishment of the Wireless Institute of Australia in March 1910. * Later in 1910 Australasian Wireless Limited obtained a licence from the Postmaster-General's Department to run telegraphy tests, from the hotel's 6th floor, with ships at sea, on 27 August.

Closure, demolition, heritage In 1968 the Hotel Australia was purchased by the MLC Insurance and Finance group who, amid mounting concerns, announced their intention of refurbishing and maintaining the hotel, one of the city's landmarks. However the following year they announced its impending closureDaily Mirror, Sydney, Monday, 31 March 1969, p.22 and closed it on 30 June 1971. They demolished it in almost record time, to erect a modern $200 million, 68-storey office block/skyscraper in its place; the MLC Centre. (MLC was later purchased, in 2000, by the National Australia Bank). The Royal Australian Historical Society who fix their famous Green Plaques to historic buildings and sites, placed their 39th plaque on the MLC Centre in memory of the Australia Hotel.

Evangelist portrait of Saint Matthew Folio 162 recto, the start of the Gospel of John Folio 24 verso, showing the names of Otto the Great and his mother Matilda The Athelstan Gospels, or British Library, Cotton MS Tiberius A. ii is a late 9th or early 10th-century Ottonian illuminated Gospel book which entered England as a gift to King Athelstan, who in turn offered it to Christ Church, Canterbury. It is also referred to as the Coronation Gospels (as are other manuscripts) on account of an early modern tradition that it had been used as an oath-book at English coronations.Backhouse, \\"The Coronation Gospels\\", p. 20. The page size is 235 x 180mm. The manuscript \\"is a concrete example of the type of Continental illuminated manuscript, imported into England in the early tenth century, which was available to the artists who laid the foundations of the Winchester school\\" of illumination. The manuscript was divided by Sir Robert Cotton when it was in his Cotton Library, who removed Papal bulls and Anglo-Saxon charters from the end of the book. Early history The Gospel book was probably written on the Continent, possibly at Lobbes Abbey (Belgium), in the late 9th or early 10th century.Keynes, \\"King Athelstan's books\\", p. 147. A few inscriptions entered into the manuscript reveal something of its subsequent history. It was presented by King Athelstan to Christ Church Priory, Canterbury, in the early 10th century, as a lengthy inscription on f. 15v records.Keynes, \\"King Athelstan's books\\", pp. 147, 149-50. The language and style of the inscription recall some of the king's charters and as in some of these charters, Athelstan is styled \\"ruler of the English [Anglorum basyleos] and ruler of the whole of Britain [curagulus totius Bryttanie]\\", associating the king with \\"an imperial past and the glories of the heirs of Rome\\".Karkov, Ruler portraits of Anglo-Saxon England, pp. 54-5\\\\. Google books link Athelstan, in turn, may have received the book from his brother-in-law Otto the Great, who was king of Germany, and Otto's mother, Matilda (d. 968). Their names ( and ) are written, probably by an Englishman, on the back of the picture of Saint Matthew (f. 24r), here shown to the right.Cannon, The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Monarchy, pp. 28-29 A third inscription, which occurs now on f. 15r but may originally have come before f. 3r, presents the Latin poem Rex pius Æðelstan (\\"Devout King Athelstan\\"), written by a continental scribe in Caroline minuscule.\\"King Athelstan's books\\", pp. 150-151. In the middle of the 10th century, the manuscript's portrait of St Matthew served as an exemplar for an Anglo-Saxon artist, who copied it into a manuscript which is classified today as Oxford, St John's College, MS 194. During the 11th and 12th century, blank spaces in the manuscript were used to record a number of texts in Old English and Latin bearing on the properties of Christ Church, Canterbury.\\"King Athelstan's books\\", p. 151. According to Neil Ker, the documents covered 11 blank leaves which Robert Cotton (d. 1631) removed from the manuscript in order to rebind them in two manuscripts, Cotton MS Claudius A. iii (ff. 2–7, 9) and MS Faustina B. vi (ff. 95, 98-100).Berkhofer III, \\"The Canterbury forgeries revisited\\", p. 49; \\"Royal\\", 103 Robert Cotton In the early 17th century, the manuscript was acquired by Sir Robert Cotton, who reused a late medieval manuscript leaf to add a title page (f. 1r) with a gold-lettered Latin poem written on it. Written as though uttered by the book itself, the poem was probably specially composed for the title page\\"King Athelstan's books\\", p. 152. and possibly by Cotton himself. It puts forward the spurious claim that Athelstan had intended the gospel book to be \\"sacred to kings, whenever they were contemplating the initial responsibilities of rule\\", apparently since Cotton assumed that kings were to swear their coronation oaths on it. A letter of his time reveals that in 1626 Cotton had presented the book to Charles I precisely for such purposes. Although it seems that Cotton's hopes were not fulfilled, it is possible that the manuscript had served its imagined purpose at the coronation of James II in 1685.\\"King Athelstan's books\\", p. 153.

The character, created by writer-director Glen Morgan and portrayed by actress Katie Cassidy, serves as a replacement to Jess from the original film. In the film, Kelli is depicted as a member of the Delta Alpha Kappa sorority. Due to being an only child and not having a large family, she decides to spend Christmas with her sorority sisters. Unfortunately, their sorority house was once the childhood home of notorious murderer Billy Lenz. During Christmas, Kelli and her sisters begin getting obscene phone calls. Realizing that Billy has returned home, the girls attempt to survive the night as, due to a snowstorm, help is unable to reach them. Critical reception towards the character was polarizing. Some considered her to be likable and sympathetic, whereas others criticized her for being bland, generic and unoriginal as well as being inferior in comparison to Jess from the original Black Christmas. Despite these criticisms, Cassidy herself was generally praised for her performance. Appearances In Black Christmas, Kelli first appears with her boyfriend Kyle, telling him that she intends on spending Christmas with her sorority sisters. After arriving back at the Delta Alpha Kappa sorority house, Kelli and her sisters are called by someone using Clair and Megan's phones. Worried about Megan, Kelli goes to her room only to find Kyle there. While attempting to find clues about her disappearance the power goes out, causing Megan's computer to switch on from standby mode and revealing a recording Kyle made of himself having sex with Megan. After kicking him out, she meets Clair's elder half-sister Leigh. Following Dana's murder, the killer uses her cellphone to call the girls. Suspecting that something is wrong, they go outside to look for her, only to discover Eve's severed head inside her car. Kelli calls 9-1-1, but is told that due to the snowstorm, help would be unavailable for at least two hours. When their housemother Mrs. Mac and Heather decide to take the car and reach the police station themselves, Kelli, Leigh and Melissa all go to Lauren's room to watch through the window and make sure they leave safely. Noticing that they're not leaving, Kelli and Leigh go to check on them through the basement where Leigh slips on Mrs. Mac's blood, who had been killed by a falling icicle. During their absence, Melissa and Lauren are killed by the assailant. Going back to Lauren's room, Kyle has returned and, after a quick confrontation between him and Leigh, they decide to go to the attic in case any of the girls are still alive. While opening up the attic door, Kyle is attacked and killed. The killer is revealed to be Billy Lenz's sister Agnes, who has set up the corpses of the sorority sisters around a Christmas tree. After Leigh falls through the attic floor, the Christmas tree catches fire while Kelli and Agnes fall into one of the holes in the wall. Managing to escape with Leigh's help, they set the house on fire and reach the hospital. At the hospital, Agnes, who had survived the fire, kills Leigh but Kelli manages to retaliate by using a defibrillator, electrocuting her. When Billy chases her to the stairs, Kelli knocks him over, impaling him on the finial of a Christmas tree and finally killing him. She is last seen staring at Billy's corpse. =Alternate endings= Black Christmas has three alternate endings, the second of which was used as the actual ending for the UK theatrical release of the movie. In the UK ending, Billy dies on the operating table from his wounds, thus when Kelli kills Agnes, the scene ends there with her parents picking her up from the hospital. The third ending is similar, having Billy die and Kelli's parents picking her up, however his body disappears and the last shot shows someone moving through the vents, indicating that either Agnes or Billy are still alive. The first ending, which follows the original script, ends with both Kelli and Leigh surviving and Kelli getting a call from someone using Kyle's cellphone. Casting and creation Cassidy, who was cast in early 2006, revealed in an interview for When a Stranger Calls (2006) that one of the reasons she became interested in the role of Kelli was because she wanted to play a leading role in a movie and loved the script. In the same interview she also described Kelli as \\"the girl next door\\" and stated that \\"she's probably there on a scholarship or something\\". In an interview with IGN, Cassidy further revealed that what attracted her to the role of Kelli is that the character \\"[grows] up\\" during the course of the film and has an active role, instead of being a damsel in distress. Reception Kelli received mostly mixed reviews from critics, with the perception being that she fails to stand out much from the rest of the characters in the movie, with Variety describing the character as generic. Horror website Dread Central, when comparing the two movies, described Kelli as \\"an awful character [who] exists in stark contrast to the very likable and level-headed Jess of the original.\\" Despite this, Screen Rant, in their list of the best final girls, when talking about Jess from the original movie, praised Kelli for being able to defeat both antagonists by herself. Katie Cassidy's performance however received a more positive response from critics. Bloody Disgusting praised Cassidy, along with her co-stars, for bringing a spin to the \\"sorority girl\\" persona. Similarly, while The Film File stated that despite from the sorority girls \\"few of them [are] likable or developed enough for the viewer to care about their fates\\", with Kelli having few personality traits, Cassidy does show a promising spark.

A list of terrorist organisations was created under the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002, as part of the fight against terrorism worldwide. The Act was passed by the Australian Parliament, \\"enabling Australian governments to deal with organisations involved in terrorism,\\" and inserted a range of terrorist organisation offences into the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). For example, the Act made it an offense to materially support or be supported by a listed terrorist organisation.Australian National Security: What Australia is doing Under Division 103 of the Criminal Code, it is illegal to finance terrorism.Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) s 1.1, Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).

A defender, he was probably best known as a captain of Bolton Wanderers and also for gaining honours representing the Republic of Ireland national football team. Playing career Born and raised in Manchester, Walsh was snapped up as a 17-year-old by Bolton Wanderers He made his debut as an 18-year-old and quickly established a reputation as a no- nonsense defender. This was rewarded by his manager Ian Greaves who made him captain. Walsh stayed with Bolton from 1974 to 1981. During this time he made 169 league appearances (+8 as sub), scored 4 goals, and in 1978 led the club to the top flight as champions of the old second division, after narrowly missing promotion the season before. In 1981, Walsh was snapped up by Howard Kendall at Everton for £90,000 plus Jim McDonagh. Walsh was one of Howard Kendall's famous 'magnificent seven' signings. He later took up loan spells at Norwich City and Burnley. In 1983, he was offered the opportunity to play in Florida for George Best's old team Fort Lauderdale Strikers. The club went bust within a season though and Walsh was quickly back home. Next stop was Manchester City but within four months he signed for Blackpool where he went on to give a further 144 league appearances. International career Though born in Manchester, Walsh qualified to play for the Republic of Ireland national football team through his Irish ancestry. He made his international debut on 21 May 1982 in a 1–0 defeat to Chile in Santiago and went on to play three more times for his adopted country. Post-playing career Walsh followed his Blackpool manager Sam Ellis to Bury as the first team coach. Upon Ellis' departure to Maine Road to join Peter Reid as his assistant, Walsh took up the reins as manager in September 1990. His time as manager lasted five years, during which he took the club to the play-offs three times, including the club's first appearance at Wembley. All this was during a time where the club had a massive financial burden and many players had to be sold to keep the club afloat. Just five games after losing in the Wembley play-off final, Walsh was cruelly sacked as the chairman became impatient despite the club having no finances to improve the team. After a brief spell of taking Barrow to the top of their division, Walsh's old Everton teammate Steve McMahon asked Walsh to join him at Swindon Town as his assistant in 1997. Walsh also stayed on to assist Jimmy Quinn after McMahon's resignation late in 1998. After being made redundant by Swindon Town, he became Peter Reid's Chief Scout at Sunderland. In 2003, he had a brief spell as manager of Southport, where, despite being in the top half of the table upon his arrival, they suffered relegation out of the Conference, only slipping into the relegation places on the last day of the season after a defeat away at Stevenage Borough. After a successful start to the season, Southport went on a long win less streak which saw them fall from top spot to the brink of not qualifying for the newly formed Conference North league, this was something deemed unthinkable for the Southport board who left with no decision but to sack Walsh and replace him with Liam Watson in an attempt to secure qualification. In 2004, Walsh was then asked back to Swindon Town as Andy King's assistant, but and decided to retire from the game a year later, and is now running a restaurant in Javea, Spain.

For example, in a game called Ringy, a circle was drawn on the ground and a fixed number of marbles from each boy were then placed into the ring. From a line drawn on the ground a short distance away, each boy would fire his Dobbert along the ground to try to knock the marbles out of the circle. Dobberts were acquired from local engineering factories. By the 1960s, larger versions of the small glass marbles were being produced - about half the size of a golf ball - and these were called dobberts (sometimes abbreviated to a 'dob'). A dobbert was worth six marbles. A bag of marbles purchased (usually in the local sweet shop) contained six marbles for the same price as one dobbert.

Etymology and signification  Its etymology and meaning are disputed, but most specialists think it comes from Saxon or Anglo-Saxon hōh \\"heel\\", sometimes hō, then \\"heel-shaped promontory\\", \\"rocky steep slope\\", \\"steep shore\\".Auguste Longnon, Les noms de lieux de la France, Paris, 1920-1929 (rééd.

This toponymic appellative appears as a final -hou or associated with the Romance definite article le Hou. It can be found everywhere in Normandy, but more in the western part of it. The English toponymy uses this Saxon or Anglo-Saxon element the same way, but its result is phonetically -hoo or -hoe, sometimes -(h)ow or -ho e. g. : Northoo (Suffolk); Poddinghoo (Worcestershire); Millhoo (Essex); Fingringhoe (Essex); Rainow (Cheshire); Soho (London); etc.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names (4th edition), Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1960, p. 244b. As an independent element it is Hoe, Hoo, Hooe, Ho or the Hoe, e.g. the Hoe at Plymouth (Dorset) above the harbour. In Normandy, it may have sometimes mixed up with Old Norse hólmr, meaning a small island, and often found anglicised elsewhere as \\"holm\\". It can still be found in modern Scandinavian languages, e.g. Stockholm. The normal evolution of hólmr in Normandy is -homme, -houme, even -onne at the end of a toponym and le Homme, le Houlme, le Hom with the article. The Norman toponym and diminutive hommet / houmet also derives from this element. In Parisian French, the equivalent is îlot, which is cognate with the English \\"islet\\".

Early life and education  Hutcheson was born to Robert Francis Hutcheson and Mary Claiborne Barksdale on January 13, 1886, near Charlotte Courthouse, Virginia. He earned a B.S. in 1907 and M.S. in 1909, both from Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute (VPI; later Virginia Tech). He also received an honorary D.Sci degree from Clemson College in 1937 and D.Agric. from North Carolina State College in 1947. Hutcheson also attended field artillery officer training school during World War I.  Career  Hutcheson taught and served as principal in schools in Virginia and Mississippi and taught at the University of Virginia before joining VPI at the Virginia Agricultural Extension Service at a livestock specialist in 1914. He became its director in 1919, serving until his appointment as executive assistant to President Burruss in 1945. After Burruss became ill, Hutcheson began acting on his behalf, until being officially appointed president on August 14, 1945. Shortly after he took over the presidency, Japan surrendered to end World War II, and a two-day celebration ensued. When the fall quarter began soon thereafter, enrollment nearly doubled that of the previous quarter. The veterans generally had no interest in joining the corps of cadets, and for the first time, during winter quarter 1946, civilians outnumbered cadets on campus. With this increase in the student population came a need for additional student housing. The college installed a trailer court for married students that they called \\"Vetsville\\" surrounding the historic Solitude farm house, which was converted into a community center for the residents. Two additional trailer courts that students called Cassell Heights after financial and business manager Stuart K. Cassell followed in the area east of present-day Cassell Coliseum. The college also rented space in the barracks at the Radford Arsenal to house other students and converted several buildings there into classrooms with the new location called \\"Rad-Tech.\\" In 1946, the Board of Visitors created a vice president position, filled by Walter S. Newman, to develop the curriculum. Hutcheson created an office of admissions to assist C. P. “Sally” Miles, dean of the college, with the thousands of applications for admission that poured into the school. During Hutcheson's tenure, VPI added a master of science in applied mechanics, resumed activities including football and student organizations that had been dropped during World War II, and created an office of student affairs. The Board of Visitors approved the final plans for the alumni war memorial and mall leading to the memorial, now the iconic War Memorial Chapel and Alumni Mall. The school received the first invitation ever issued to a Virginia college team to play in a bowl game, the Sun Bowl on New Year's Day in 1947. In December 1946, Hutcheson became ill, and in May 1947 Newman was named acting president. Although Hutcheson recovered, the Board voted on August 12 to relieve him of his presidential duties, appointed him as the first university chancellor, and named Newman president, effective September 1, 1947. In 1948 Hutcheson became president of the newly established VPI Educational Foundation. He retired as chancellor in 1956 to devote full attention to the foundation, which he served until his death on January 23, 1962.  Personal life  Hutcheson married Eleanor Parrott in 1917, and they had three children: Eleanor Barksdale, John Redd, Jr., and Robert Parrott Hutcheson. Robert died in World War II, and Eleanor married Charles Catlett, III. John Redd Hutcheson and his brother Thomas Barksdale Hutcheson inherited the Barksdale family's farm, Edgemont Farm. John supervised the farm, along with other family members, from 1950 until 1962, when full supervision was turned over to T. B. Hutcheson, Jr. Honors Hutcheson Hall, an academic building on the Virginia Tech Campus is named in honor of Hutcheson and his brother Thomas B. Hutcheson.

When London's Capital Radio started in 1973 he was presenter/producer of \\"Kerry-Go-Round\\", aimed at younger listeners. He then dedicated more time to producing two weekend magazine shows in \\"Hullabaloo\\" and \\"Sunday Supplement\\" for the station in addition to working on other outside projects such as the Stage Broadcast Company, which provided the Capital Radio Video Show throughout the 80s and Voicebox Sound Equipment. While at Capital Radio, Juby produced several features on the working lives of ordinary people and communities, including a profile of the Thames bargemen, called Lighmen and Watermen, and a programme on the Hastings fishing community. His combination of engineering and presenting skills allowed him to have strong editorial control over his work. Like John Peel, Juby was never completely comfortable with any aspect of fame that accompanied simply being 'on the radio', preferring to focus on the quality of his output and creating programmes of real listener interest. Subsequently, he worked for Kent-based ILR station Invicta Radio, where he was instrumental in setting up Coast AM after the station's FM/AM frequencies were separated. After the success of Coast Am, where he launched the career of amongst others Paul Stafford, Eamon Kelly and Simon Lee he was promoted to head of Invicta Group, before joining Talk Radio UK as a freelance producer. Kerry worked for Classic FM producing Masterclass a programme designed for the young that helped explain classical music. Kerry Juby also invented the name \\"Orange\\" for the famous Orange amplifiers that are used today. He was the author of books about Kate Bush (\\"Kate Bush\\" ) and David Bowie (\\"David Bowie In other words\\" ) He died of lung cancer in July 2003 at the age of 55.

It had originally been planned as a red brick building but native limestone was substituted when brick became unavailable due a shortage caused by military construction during World War I.

Despite this the channel faced financial difficulties. In September 2000 Tamil Media Ltd, owner of IBC Radio, took a 50% stake in TRT, against the wishes of Kuhanathan. On January 14, 2001 TRT was renamed Tamil Television Network. Sabapathy Suppiah Kuhanathan now started Dish Asia Network and DAN Tamil Alai Radio Closure The French authorities started investigating TTN after the Sri Lankan government protested about its links to the Tamil Tigers. The investigations revealed that TTN did not have a license to broadcast from the Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA), the French broadcasting regulator. Later TTN applied for a license but this was rejected by the CSA in February 2006 as TTN was already broadcasting from French soil without a license. The matter was referred to the Procureur de la République (Attorney General). The channel ceased broadcasting on 2 May 2007 when Globecast stopped relaying the channel. Relaunch In 2013 TTN Tamil Oli has started their own IP TV Service, where you could watch Tamil Channels like TTN Tamil Oli and more channels.

The P&F; began operations in 1935 using abandoned Toledo and Western Railroad trackage between Pioneer and Fayette, Ohio. The P&F; connected with the Wabash at Franklin Junction near Alvordton, Ohio. Motive power for the P&F; was a Plymouth 25-ton model HL 4-wheel gasoline locomotive (builder plate #3835) built in 1936. The locomotive was first numbered 102 and later became number 10. About 1943, the P&F; was cut back to 0.5 miles of track at Franklin Junction and freight was trans-loaded onto P&F; trucks for final delivery. The only industry actually located on the P&F; was a small feed/grain facility, which also served as the railroad's engine maintenance shed, since both the \\"main track\\" and passing track ran through the building. In 1986, grant money was obtained in an attempt to revitalize the P&F;, which by then was out of service. The line was upgraded with new rails, ties and heavy ballast. Plymouth No. 10, was given a complete rebuild and re-engined with a 1985 Oldsmobile 98 engine.

He was one of the Sioux leaders who supported the United States in the War of 1812. He retained his loyalty even after his capture by the British, during which he refused to divulge information about the Americans on pain of death (a threat which turned out to be a bluff). Because of his loyalty to America, Tamaha was presented a Peace Medal and Loyalty papers by William Clarke. These papers can be seen at the Minnesota History Center. Tamaha carried these papers with him and would charge people to see them. Tamaha was known as a powerful orator and a diplomat of unusual ability.

He was also chairman of the faculty at the University of Virginia (then equivalent to president) from 1895 through 1903. He made major changes to the medical curriculum at U.Va, adding requirements for clinical training, as was common in Europe. Barringer gained national attention in 1900, when a talk he gave to a southern medical association was printed and distributed to other regional medical groups. It was entitled The American Negro: His Past and Future, and he explored what he described as \\"the Negro problem\\" in the South. At the time, prior to the Great Migration, African Americans made up the majority of population in numerous counties, and he advocated a practice of racial eugenics. In this period, southern states were passing laws to disenfranchise African Americans and exclude them from the political system, while passing Jim Crow laws and the one drop rule, which penalized persons of any known African ancestry. During Barringer's tenure as chairman of the faculty, U.Va., perceived by many Southerners as the region's flagship university, became a hotbed of eugenics teaching that continued under its first president Edwin Alderman who took over when the Jeffersonian system of faculty rule ended in 1904. Since its founding in 1819, U.Va traditionally was an academy for Virginia's planter class aristocracy whose interest in family lineage went hand in hand with the science of improving the human stock. After resigning the VPI presidency, Barringer returned to Charlottesville and practiced medicine. He served the United States government for a few years during World War I by supervising public health in some mining towns. After the war he returned to his farm and medical practice. Early life and education Barringer was the son of Confederate General Rufus Clay Barringer and Eugenia (née Morrison) Barringer. He was named after his paternal grandfather, General Paul Barringer (1776-1835), a veteran of the War of 1812. His father was an attorney who became an officer in the Confederate Army during the Civil War. His maternal grandfather, Robert Hall Morrison, was a Presbyterian preacher and the first president of Davidson College. Barringer was a nephew of Confederate Generals Stonewall Jackson and Daniel Harvey Hill. He spent some of his childhood in Concord, North Carolina, near where his father had grown up. As an eight-year- old in 1865, the young Barringer beat Confederate States of America President Jefferson Davis in a game of chess in 1865. Davis had stopped with his family after fleeing Richmond, Virginia following the surrender of Robert E. Lee. Barringer attended the Bingham School near Asheville, North Carolina, and the Kenmore University School in Amherst Courthouse, Virginia. He received his M.D. degree from the University of Virginia in 1877 and an M.D. from the University of the City of New York in 1878. Barringer later received an LL.D. from Davidson College in 1900 and an LL. D. from the University of South Carolina in 1904. Career Barringer practiced medicine in Dallas, North Carolina for three years before going to Europe to study under medical specialists there. From 1881 to 1884 he studied in clinics in London, Paris, and Vienna. On his return from Europe, he settled on a farm near Charlotte, North Carolina. He both practiced medicine and supervised the Piedmont farm. From 1884 to 1889, he also established and headed a medical preparatory school at Davidson College. In 1889 Barringer accepted a position as chair of Physiology and chair of Surgery at University of Virginia. He served as chairman of the faculty at UVA (a position then equivalent to president) from 1895 to 1903. As chairman of the faculty, Barringer oversaw a major revision of the medical curriculum. Clinical years of education were added to strengthen training, as was common in Europe. He also was the main driving force behind the construction and staffing of the first University of Virginia Hospital. Barringer continued his own research and published a variety of scientific papers dealing with cholera, syphilis, and typhoid fever. He was a recognized authority on venomous reptiles and wrote extensively on the subject. He wrote a series of studies of the American Negro between 1896 and 1901. Barringer rose to national prominence in 1900 after his presentation to the Tri-State Medical Association in Charleston, South Carolina, titled The American Negro: His Past and Future. Barringer addressed what he repeatedly called the \\"negro problem\\" facing the South. He advocated racial eugenics, a concept that was considered progressive at the time was increasingly considered desirable among some European-American elites. Barringer suggested in his talk that American Negroes had been better off as slaves. The Association voted unanimously to print Barringer's lecture and send copies to all of the medical societies in the South. (This was the period when southern states were disfranchising blacks, imposing Jim Crow laws, and passing one- drop rule that increased discrimination against persons of any African ancestry.) Barringer had likely learned, long before this time, that his father had sired two mixed-race sons with an enslaved black woman, Thomas Clay and Warren Clay Coleman (b. 1849), before his parent's marriage and before he was born. His half-brother Warren Clay Coleman was ambitious and had established several businesses in Concord, North Carolina, likely with some financial assistance by his father. By 1900 Coleman is thought to have been the wealthiest man of color in North Carolina, and possibly in the country. He was a founder of the first textile mill to be owned and operated by African Americans. Barringer was professor of therapeutics and pharmacology at UVA from 1903 to 1907, when he accepted the presidency at Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute (V.P.I., now Virginia Tech) at age 50. Barringer's gravestone at the University of Virginia Cemetery in Charlottesville, Virginia. During Barringer's administration at V.P.I., entrance requirements were increased; a Farmer's Winter Course was established; summer school was expanded; and Agricultural Hall (now known as Price Hall) was completed. Barringer's tenure as president was marred by disagreements with faculty and alumni as well as the Governor of Virginia over the direction of the university. Barringer, a gentleman farmer, was determined to develop the agricultural facet of the College until it achieved parity with the engineering component, which angered some faculty members and alumni who believed the institution needed to emphasize training for the emerging industrial society. In 1909, the Chairman of the Alumni Association Welfare Committee, Lawrence Priddy, tried unsuccessfully to have Barringer ousted by the Board of Visitors. The Board ordered an investigation. A public hearing was held 25 March 1910, during which Priddy's charges were dismissed as \\"unwarranted\\" and \\"inaccurate.\\" However, this was not the end of Barringer's troubles at V.P.I. In the fall of 1911, the Board called for another investigation when a former Commandant of the Corps of Cadets accused Barringer of \\"countenancing immorality\\" on campus. An investigation concluded that the charges were \\"without foundation.\\" Having survived those troubles, Barringer ran afoul of the Governor, William Hodges Mann, who wanted V.P.I to become involved in agricultural extension work, to be sponsored by the federal government, which was trying to encourage modern agricultural practices. Barringer disagreed, so Mann said he would appoint a Board of Visitors that was opposed to Barringer if the president did not resign. On 10 June 1912, Barringer tendered his resignation; the Board asked him to continue in office for another year until a new president could be selected. A year after Barringer's departure from V.P.I., the Smith–Lever Act of 1914 established a system of cooperative extension services, connected to the land-grant universities authorized by Congress. After leaving V.P.I., Barringer returned to Charlottesville and practiced medicine. He had a few years of government service during World War I, when he supervised public health measures in American coal mining areas. Efforts to increase production as part of the war effort resulted in related interest in improving public health at those sites. Barringer died in Charlottesville on Jan. 9, 1941, at age 83. He is buried in the University of Virginia Cemetery.  Personal life  Barringer married Nannie Hannah in 1882, and the couple had 10 children. Written works Barringer's history of the University of Virginia: University of Virginia : its history, influence, equipment and characteristics, with biographical sketches and portraits of founders, benefactors, officers and alumni (1904) is considered one of the standard texts on the subject.

He attended Prince Edward Academy and then Hampden-Sydney College in Hampden-Sydney, Virginia, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1886 and later a Master's Degree. Career =Public school career= From 1886 until 1889, Eggleston served as a public school teacher in Virginia, Georgia, and North Carolina. He taught high school in Asheville, North Carolina, until 1893 when he became superintendent of the public schools in Asheville. He continued in this position until 1900. Two years later Eggleston was appointed as the editor and secretary of the Bureau of Information and Publicity of the Southern Education Board at the University of Tennessee. In this position, he was \\"charged with studying education conditions with the goal of improving social, economic, and cultural circumstances in the South by improving the quality of education throughout the region.\\" In 1903, Eggleston returned to Prince Edward County to serve as the superintendent of schools until he became the first elected State Superintendent of Virginia public schools, a position he held from 1906 until 1912. Eggleston then briefly served as chief of the Division of Rural Education in the U.S. Bureau of Education from January to July 1913 before accepting the presidency of Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute. The Work of the Rural School In 1913, Eggleston published The Work of the Rural School. The book is an in-depth study (with images) of rural schools in the United States. Eggleston, throughout the book, discusses what rural schools were like at the time, as well as proposed changes needed. Eggleston used many of his own experiences as a guide in writing the book; for example, Chapter XIV is entitled, \\"The State Superintendent of Public Instruction,\\" and is an in depth study into the position and how it operates (pulling from his own experiences as state superintendent of Virginia). =President of Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute= Eggleston served as president of Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute (now known as Virginia Tech) from 1913 until his resignation in 1919. He served as president during World War I when a Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) unit was established at the school, and the school \\"became a national training center for war.\\" In an attempt to help the war effort, Eggleston \\"offered the services of the university's extension service to the Federal Food Commission, to promote food production and conservation.\\" =President of Hampden-Sydney College= Bagby Hall — built under Eggleston's tutelage Eggleston served as president of Hampden-Sydney College from 1919 until 1939. During his 20-year term as president of the college, Eggleston brought various innovations to the administration of the school. For example, he hired a full-time business manager, instituted an annual budget, and had a dean deal with student issues. Under Eggleston's leadership the school saw a new \\"building entirely for the sciences Bagby Hall) . . . . [Eggleston also] persuaded a descendant of one of the founding Trustees to give a building (Morton Hall) in memory of his ancestor - the most generous gift the College ever received.\\" While Eggleston was president of Hampden-Sydney, Virginia Tech invited him to be the commencement speaker in 1939. He retired as president in 1935, staying on four years until a successor was found.  Personal life  Eggleston married Julia Johnson in Farmville, Virginia, on December 18, 1895, and the couple had two children: Elizabeth Carrington Eggleston and Joseph DuPuy Eggleston, III. Dr. Eggleston became an enthusiast of Prince Edward County history and family genealogy. His collection of notes and research on many Southside Virginia families can be viewed at the library of the Virginia Museum of History and Culture, previously the Virginia Historical Society (VHS). Eggleston was the president of VHS from 1938-1943. Death After retirement, Eggleston continued to live on campus at Hampden-Sydney College. He died March 13, 1953 and is interred at Union Theological Seminary Cemetery. Legacy Eggleston dedicated his entire life to education. In fact, volume 24, issue seven of American Education, which hosts a picture of Eggleston along with his name and position as president of Hampden-Sydney on its cover, notes that, \\"[e]ducation as a life work strongly appealed to Dr. Eggleston even in his youth.\\"Pollock, Horation M. Ed. \\"American Education\\", Volume 27, Issue 4. New York: New York Education Co. 1921. p. 308. Only two years into his presidency at Hampden- Sydney College, it was noted that he was, \\"widely and favorably known as an expert in school affairs, and his services [were] constantly in demand in educational gatherings.\\" While Eggleston was state superintendent of public education in Virginia, he revolutionized the state education system, making it an organized system. In fact, Eggleston left the public school system in Virginia \\"thoroughly co-ordinated, with better school buildings, longer terms, more efficient teachers, increased salaries, more school libraries, with abundant high schools in every section . . . . [T]he result he left [was] a thoroughly developed school system.\\" This theme of innovation in education continued through his terms as president of Virginia Tech and of Hampden- Sydney. Eggleston's life was one devoted to education and the improvement of its instruction. Honors In 1952, a three-winged residence hall constructed by the Federal Works Agency between 1935 and 1940 at Virginia Tech was named for Eggleston.

Biography Mahmoud Dowlatabadi was born into a poor family of shoemakers in Dowlatabad, a remote village in Sabzevar, the northwestern part of Khorasan Province, Iran.An Iranian Storyteller’s Personal Revolution. Larry Rohter. New York Times. July 1, 2012. He worked as a farmhand and attended Mas'ud Salman Elementary School. Books were a revelation to the young boy. He \\"read all the romances [available]... around the village\\".Interview with Mahmoud Dowlatabadi He \\"read on the roof of the house with a lamp…read War and Peace that way\\" while living in Tehran. Though his father had little formal education, he introduced Dowlatabadi to the Persian classical poets, Saadi Shirazi, Hafez, and Ferdowsi. His father generally spoke in the language of the great poets. Nahid Mozaffari, who edited a PEN anthology of Iranian literature, said that Dowlatabadi \\"has an incredible memory of folklore, which probably came from his days as an actor or from his origins, as somebody who didn't have a formal education, who learned things by memorizing the local poetry and hearing the local stories.\\" As a teenager, Dowlatabadi took up a trade like his father and opened a barbershop. One afternoon, he found himself hopelessly bored. He closed the shop, gave the keys to a boy, and told him to tell his father, \\"Mahmoud's left.\\" He caught a ride to Mashhad, where he worked for a year before leaving for Tehran to pursue theatre. Dowlatabadi worked there for a year before he could attend theatre classes. When he did, he rose to the top of his class, still doing numerous other jobs. He was an actor---and a shoemaker, barber, bicycle repairman, street barker, worker in cotton factory, and cinema ticket taker. Around this time he also ventured into journalism, fiction writing, and screenplays. He said in an interview \\"whenever I was done with work and wasn't preoccupied with finding food and so on, I would sit down and just write\\". He performed Brecht (e.g. The Visions of Simone Machard), Arthur Miller (e.g. A View from the Bridge) and Bahram Beyzai (e.g. The Marionettes). He was arrested by the Savak, the Shah's secret police force in 1974. Dowlatabad's novels also attracted the attention of local police. When he asked what was his crime, they told him, \\"Nothing, but everyone we arrest seems to have copies of your novels so that makes you provocative to revolutionaries.\\" He was in prison for two years. Towards the end of his incarceration, Dowlatabadi said \\"The story of Missing Soluch came to me all at once, and I wrote the entire work in my head.\\" Dowlatabadi couldn't write anything down while in prison. He \\"become restless\\". One of the prisoners...said to him, 'You used to be so good at putting up with prison, now why're you so impatient?' He replied that \\"my anxiety isn't related to prison and all that came with it, but about something else entirely. I had to write this book.\\" When he was finally released, he wrote Missing Soluch in 70 nights. It later became his first novel published in English, preceding The Colonel.Haus Publishing. The Colonel Works Dowlatabadi in 2011 = Kelidar = Kelidar is a saga about a Kurdish nomadic family that spans 10 books and 3,000 pages. Encyclopædia Iranica praises its \\"heroic, lyrical, and sensual\\" language. The story is tremendously popular among Iranians due to \\"its detailed portrayal of political and social upheaval.\\" Dowlatabadi spent over a decade crafting the tale. \\"I spent fifteen years preparing, writing short stories, sometimes writing works that were a little longer, the grounds towards what would become Kelidar,\\" he said. =Missing Soluch= In Missing Soluch, an impoverished woman raises her children in an isolated village after the unexplained disappearance of her husband, Soluch. Though the idea for the novel first came to Dowlatabadi in prison, its origins trace back to his childhood. \\"My mother used to talk about a woman in the village whose husband had disappeared and had left her alone. She was left to raise several children on her own. Since she didn't want the village to pity her, she would take a bit of lamb's fat and melt it and then toss a handful of dry grass or something into the pan and put this in the oven, so that with the smoke that would come out of the oven the neighbors might think that she was cooking a meat stew for her children that night,\\" he told an interviewer. Missing Soluch was his first work translated into English. =The Colonel= The Colonel is a novel about nation, history, and family, beginning on a rainy night when two policemen summon the Colonel to collect the tortured body of his daughter, a victim of the Islamic Revolution. Dowlatabadi wrote the novel in the 1980s, when intellectuals were in danger of execution. \\"I hid it in a drawer when I finished it,\\" he said. Though it is published abroad in English, the novel is not available in Iran, in Persian. \\"I did not even want to have this on their radar,\\" he said. \\"Either they would take me to prison or prevent me from working. They would have their ways.\\" The novel was first published in Germany, later in the UK and United States. =Thirst= Thirst (Persian: Besmel) is a novel of the Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988). It is written from the perspectives of two Iraqi and Iranian writers. The original Persian title refers to the concept of 'besmel' explained in a footnote as: \\"the supplication required in Islam before the sacrifice of any animal\\". It is used repeatedly in the text, as the characters find it applies to them. Influence Dowlatabadi is celebrated as one of the most important writers in contemporary Iran, particularly for his use of language. He elevates rural speech, drawing on the rich, lyrical tradition of Persian poetry. He \\"examines the complexities and moral ambiguities of the experience of the poor and forgotten, mixing the brutality of that world with the lyricism of the Persian language,\\" said Kamran Rastegar, a translator of Dowlatabadi's work. When Tom Patterdale translated Dowlatabadi's The Colonel, he avoided Latinate English words in favor of Anglo-Saxon ones, hoping to reproduce the effect Dowlatabadi's \\"rough and ready\\" prose.The Three Percent, a blog on translation. University of Rochester Most other Iranian writers come from solidly middle-class backgrounds, with urban educations. Because of his rural background, Dowlatabadi stands out as a unique voice. He has also garnered praise internationally, with Kirkus Reviews calling The Colonel, \\"A demanding and richly composed book by a novelist who stands apart.\\"Kirkus Reviews. The Colonel The Independent described the novel as \\"passionate,\\" and emphasized, \\"It's about time that everyone even remotely interested in Iran read this novel.\\" The Independent review of The Colonel Safarnameh Sistan, a documentary which was made by Ali Zare Ghanat Nowi in 2011, about a trip to Sistan and meeting Balochi ethnics, illustrating the very hard life of people living there, giving information about their life style in such a dry area, is a free adaptation from Meet the Baloch People by Mahmoud Dowlatabadi.

McBryde was born in Abbeville, South Carolina. He entered South Carolina College in 1858 at age 17 before going on to the University of Virginia. In 1861, he returned to Abbeville where he joined the Confederate Army. McBryde was present at the opening bombardment of Fort Sumter, South Carolina and fought in a Virginia cavalry unit. He later served as division chief of the Confederate War Tax Office in Richmond Virginia. After the war until 1867, McBryde farmed in Buckingham County, Virginia until he moved to large farm near Charlottesville, Virginia. McBryde then went to teach at South Carolina College where he served as faculty chair and then as president from 1883–1891. McBryde also served as assistant Secretary of Agriculture under President Grover Cleveland. During McBryde's 16-year tenure as President of Virginia Agriculture and Mechanical College, the college expanded greatly. McByrde expanded the curriculum to include seven bachelor's degrees in Agriculture, Horticulture, Applied Chemistry, General Science, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering and founded a graduate department in 1891. The new curriculum no longer reflected the name of the college and in 1896 the Virginia General Assembly changed the college's name to Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute, shortened in popular usage to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and then to VPI. The new name also brought new colors, which still stand as Chicago maroon and burnt orange, a school motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve), and a new college yell which prompted the nickname Hokies. During his tenure, V.P.I.'s first native-limestone-clad, neo-Gothic-style building, known as \\"The Chapel\\", was constructed on the site where Newman Library stands today. McByrde's legacy caused him to be known as the \\"Father of the Modern VPI.\\" In the late 1800s McBryde persuaded the Board of Visitors to build the 15,147-square-foot Southern Colonial Revival mansion now known as \\"The Grove\\" to house the V.P.I. president, and became the first president to live in the house upon its completion in 1902. In 1907 upon retirement, McByrde was named first \\"President Emeritus\\" of Virginia Tech and also received Virginia Tech's first honorary degree (Doctor of Science). He died at age 82 on March 20, 1923, in New Orleans, Louisiana.Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Historical Data Book: Centennial Edition, ed. Jenkins Mikell Robertson, Bulletin of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, vol. 65, no. 4, 69-70. Honors McBryde Hall, a large classroom building on the Virginia Tech Campus is named for McBryde. The Modernist structure, replaced an earlier building known as McBryde Hall, built in 1917 in the Collegiate Gothic style to replace the Preston and Olin Building, then known as the VPI shop building, that had burned to the ground in 1914. Old McByrde hall was razed in the late 1960s and the current building was completed in 1972.
