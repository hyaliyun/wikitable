This landform commonly occurs on the flanks of a mountain, as part of a dissected plateau. A loan word from the Spanish language, potrero is in current use in the southwestern United States, where it is sometimes translated as \\"tongue of land\\" and \\"enclosed piece of pasture land\\".John Peabody Harrington (1916) The Ethnogeography of the Tewa Indians, pages 29‚Äì618 in Twenty-ninth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 1907‚Äì1908, Government Printing Office, Washington. Page 259. In the Spanish language, however, the \\"tongue of land\\" sense is archaic. Also archaic is the related sense of potrero referring to someone who wrangles young horses (potros in Spanish) kept as breeding stock (not saddle or pack stock). In Spanish, the usual sense of potrero now refers to any land (such as a ranch, open range, or community pasture) where such horses are kept. Notable examples of potreros include some of the many mesas of the Pajarito Plateau near Santa Fe, New Mexico (United States). Historically, these potreros were used as winter pasture for livestock (horses, sheep, and cattle) that were driven to and from lush summer pastures in the high grass valleys (valles) of the Valles Caldera. Today, these potreros are used in this manner by a large herd of elk. These potreros are natural enclosures, with only one principal exit: the narrow connection to higher land. In Spain a potrero is common land in poor condition. References Category:Mesas Category:Tables (landform) .

Early life Tipping was born in the Ch√¢teau de Ville-d'Avray near Versailles, while his parents were living in France before moving into Brasted Place in Kent, where he grew up. He belonged to a Quaker Christian family of businessmen, who had prospered in the corn trade in Liverpool. His father, William Tipping (1816‚Äì1897), was a railway company owner and amateur archaeologist and artist, who served as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Stockport between 1868‚Äì74 and 1885‚Äì86. His mother Maria (n√©e Walker, 1822‚Äì1911) was the daughter of a flax mill owner from Leeds. Henry Avray Tipping was educated in France and Middlesex before reading modern history at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was a member of the Oxford University Dramatic Society. He worked briefly as a university lecturer before joining the staff of the Dictionary of National Biography, where he concentrated on genealogical research. H. Gerrish, 'The Life of H. Avray Tipping', in Bulletin of the Welsh Historic Gardens Trust; No. 53 (Winter 2008/09), pp.6‚Äì7 He also wrote musical comedies, performed locally in Kent, and became an expert on wood carving, particularly the work of Grinling Gibbons. Career However, his main interest was gardening and garden design. In the 1880s, he lived at The Quarry, a house at Brasted (built on the Brasted Place estate for him as a bachelor house in 1874) where he designed his first garden. The house is built of ragstone from the former quarry in the grounds. The deep and rather damp quarry provided scope for creation of a fashionable fern garden with a series of ponds (fed by water from a rainwater cistern under the house), paths and bridges. Around the house extensive gardens were created including rose gardens, lawns and some specimen trees. 'Quarry', renamed 'Badgers' in 1971 and since extended, is built with an upstairs studio overlooking the grounds, to serve his needs as study for writing. Brasted Place survives and was eventually converted to apartments in the 1990s. Tipping later moved to a cottage at Ramsbury in Wiltshire in 1890. He also began writing articles for The Garden, a magazine which had been founded by William Robinson in 1871; and between 1904 and 1909 he also edited the three-volume work In English Homes, a largely photographic survey of English domestic architecture. After The Garden became absorbed by Country Life in 1905, Tipping became one of Country Life's principal contributors.A Biography of H Avray Tipping at www.gardenvisit.com In 1907 he was appointed as the magazine's Architectural Editor, and became recognised as one of the leading authorities on the history, architecture, furnishings and gardens of country houses in Britain.Avray Tipping at www.gardenhistoryinstitute.co.uk In 1910 Sir Lawrence Weaver became Architectural Editor, allowing Tipping time to write his books. However, in 1916 during the First World War, Weaver was appointed as a civil servant, with Tipping taking back the role of Architectural Editor, which he held until his retirement in 1930. Thereafter he continued as an architectural writer for the magazine until his death. He also worked as a garden designer in the Arts and Crafts style; he was a friend of Gertrude Jekyll, Harold Peto and Edwin Lutyens. His gardens were characterised by divided compartments with sculpted yew hedging, topiary birds and animals, long grass bowling greens, lush planting and wild areas. His garden design works include the walled garden designed for Arthur Lee, its then owner, at Chequers, and several in his adopted county of Monmouthshire. In 1894 he bought Mathern Palace, a ruined former bishops' palace near Chepstow, from George Carwardine Francis, a local solicitor who had purchased it from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners five years earlier. Tipping rebuilt the property; moved to live there with his mother; designed and, then laid out its surrounding gardens. After inheriting a large fortune upon the deaths of both his brother and mother in 1911, he let (and later sold) Mathern Palace, and bought land at Mounton, again near Chepstow. The following year he commissioned from local architect Eric Francis ‚Äì the son of George Carwardine Francis ‚Äì an ambitious new house, Mounton House, above a small limestone gorge where Tipping designed his own formal gardens.Ivor Waters, Chepstow Scrapbook, Moss Rose Press, 1986, , p.96 He also planned the gardens at Wyndcliffe Court, St Arvans, near Chepstow, a new house designed by Francis for the Clay family who owned the Piercefield estate. In 1922 Tipping bought land from the Duke of Beaufort near Trellech in Monmouthshire, and commissioned another new house, High Glanau Manor, also designed by Eric Francis. Again he took responsibility for its overall stylistic creation and that of its garden. Tipping gave away Mounton House to his brother's godson. In later life High Glanau became his country residence. Nevertheless, he still owned a smaller property, Harefield House at Harefield in Middlesex, which became his main residence in the final years before his death. In 1927, he became a member of the first committee of the Gardens of England and Wales Scheme, later known as the National Gardens Scheme, and the following year helped organise an international exhibition of garden design for the Royal Horticultural Society. He also continued to write, both for Country Life and the Morning Post. Death Before his death, Tipping instructed his friend and head gardener, Walter Wood, to whom he left most of his fortune, to destroy all his papers. Only a single year's diary survived.

Burdett- Coutts had held the seat since it had been created for the 1918 general election, when he had been returned unopposed. Candidates The Conservative candidate was John Nicholson.

The League was formed to advance the political ambitions of the newspaper owner Lord Rothermere. He is known in particular, with his brother Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe, for the development of the British newspapers Daily Mail and Daily Mirror - he was a pioneer of popular journalism. The objects of the League were to insist upon measures being taken to restore the country to solvency, urge a wholesale reduction of expenditure, fight the battle of local rates and oppose sham Anti-Waste candidates. There was a growing element both inside and outside the Conservative element of the Coalition Government, that opposed the post-war reconstruction methods adopted by Lloyd George and other leading Liberals in the coalition, notably Christopher Addison, who as Housing Minister had introduced a series of measures to enable local councils to build Council houses. These measures were funded by higher taxation and in accordance with Lloyd George's aim to build a \\"Land Fit for Heroes\\".

According to folklore, both bays were so named because cattle once roamed the whole area and were slaughtered to provide food for buccaneers and English colonists. Industry in the area includes quarrying for gypsum. Floods As a result of being located in the floodplains of five rivers (the Salt Spring River, Chalky River, Bull Park River, Spring Gut River and the Cane River), Bull Bay has been the subject of several floods. The land is low-lying, with an approximate maximum elevation of above sea level. The drainage basin is composed of relatively hard and impervious rock structures. The floods in September 2002 followed heavy rainfall that month (), due to Hurricane Lili. One person died. Local residents described the flood as being the most disastrous since Hurricane Gilbert in September 1988. A contributing factor to the flooding was identified by residents as silt. Some of this comes from local quarries, particularly belonging to Jamaica Gypsum & Quarries Ltd., but local deforestation by residents seeking firewood was also a contributing factor. The dumping of garbage was another factor. The Ten Miles and Eleven Miles areas of Bull Bay are regularly subject to floods. Residents have lost livestock, personal belongings, cars, and houses.

Its name is derived from the classical term Castalian Spring, a symbol for poetic inspiration. The name has often been claimed as that which the King used to refer to the group, as in lines from one of his own poems, an epitaph on his friend Alexander Montgomerie: The notion of the 'Castalian band' in 20th-century scholarship derives in the main from a 1969 book by Helena Mennie Shire. It was H. Mennie Shire and her collaborator Kenneth Elliot ‚Äì who had produced The Music of Scotland (Cambridge 1964) ‚Äì who drew particular attention to the verse lines by James, remarking that \\"It has been well suggested that King James' name for his poets at court, or their name for themselves, was 'the brethren of Castalian band.'\\" However, apart from this verse, no scholar has produced any clear evidence for any such self-aware grouping. Nevertheless, other writers (and numerous websites) have seized on the concept. In a celebrated article from 2001, the literary scholar Priscilla Bawcutt examined the claims closely, and ‚Äì in the opinion of most modern authorities ‚Äì demolished them. However, the persistence of the idea of the Castalian Band has its own interest ‚Äì as Bawcutt noted, suggesting that it is grounded in a desire to identify a strong Scottish Renaissance culture. Poetry, and more especially song, had suffered as a result of the Reformation of the Scottish Protestant church concluded in 1560, and it may have seemed desirable to offer a more positive image for the later 16th century. Whether or not there ever was such a Court grouping as the Castalian Band, it seems likely that there were cultivated circles of educated gentlemen in Scotland at the time. The King wrote a detailed treatise intended to establish a standard of practice in Scots poetry ‚Äì his Reulis and Cautelis ‚Äì and there may well have been gatherings of poets at James' court. The activities of some of the poets recognized to be working in Scotland at the time are known to a limited extent. The principal literary figure to be directly associated with the court was Alexander Montgomerie. Music may also played an important part in performances; some of the poems of Montgomerie and others are known to have been set as song. \\"Brethren\\" of the Castalian Band Danish portrait\\". The circle of poets with known connections to the Scottish court include: *King James VI *Alexander Montgomerie (c. 1544‚Äì1598?) *Patrick Hume of Polwarth (c. 1550-1609) *Alexander Hume (c. 1557‚Äì1609) the younger brother of Patrick Hume *William Fowler (1560‚Äì1612) *John Stewart of Baldynneis (c. 1567‚Äì1605) *Thomas Hudson (d. 1605) *Robert Hudson, brother of Thomas Membership was supposedly fluidSee . RDS Jack ‚Äì a well-reputed scholar who took up the 'Castalian' idea ‚Äì claimed that James, as both patron and head, could effectively determine who was \\"in\\" or \\"out\\" of the inner circle, but this has to be counterbalanced with the fact that the young King did also recognise himself as, to an extent, in tutelage to poetic superiors. and some figures, such as Montgomerie, were already established poets. French influences were particularly important for the King. James himself made translations of work by the Gascon soldier-poet du Bartas, and du Bartas in return translated James's own Lepanto. Du Bartas himself visited the Scottish Court on a diplomatic mission in 1587 during which time James unsuccessfully attempted to persuade him to stay.Encyclopedia of literary translation into English, Volume 1, Olive Classe, editor. p.383. King James translated his L'Uranie. Other 'Castalian' makars produced translation as well as original works. William Fowler, whose original poetry includes the sonnet sequence The Tarantula of Love,See Elizabeth Elliot for an online evaluation of Fowler's sonnets. made translations from Petrarch,His versions of Petrarch's Petrarch, Trionfi, published 1587. while John Stewart produced an abridged translation of Ariosto's Orlando Furioso.published 1590. Many Scots translations predated first translations of the same works in England. Chief among the circle was arguably the soldier, courtier and makar Alexander Montgomerie.The King referred to him as \\"beloved Sanders, maistre of our art\\". See for instance . He had achieved celebrity after victory over Patrick Hume in The Flyting Betwixt Montgomerie and Polwart (c.1583).Flyting was a fearless poetic contest with a considerable tradition as court entertainment in Scotland. His many works include public poems such as The Navigatioun, a long allegory called The Cherry and the Slae, some devotional poems, and a large number of personal court lyrics sometimes modelled on poets such as Ronsard. Sonnets on various themes include an autobiographical sequence that deftly charts frustration with \\"the law's delay\\".In the early 1590s Montgomerie was fighting to reclaim his pension, lost during a period of political imprisonment in England. Even when Montgomerie came to be politically excluded from the court sometime in the mid-1590s as a result of his Catholic sympathies, he appears to have retained the affection of the King. Evidence comes in a poem by James, c.1598, which contains both the epitaph for Montgomerie (quoted above) and a complaint at the silence of the other \\"sacred bretheren\\" on the subject of the erstwhile \\"prince of po√´ts\\". The court also attracted figures from furth of Scotland. The brothers Thomas and Robert Hudson from the North of England, were appointed as by James not only as poets but as court musicians helping to lead the musical \\"revival\\" he regarded as going hand-in-hand with his literary programme.See Thomas produced translations as well as original work. Under James' patronage he was another translator of du Bartas.Thomas Hudson translated du Bartas' Judith. The King contributed a laudatory sonnet to its publication in 1584. Names on the fringes of court literary circles include: *William Alexander, Earl of Stirling (1567‚Äì1640) *Robert Aytoun (1569‚Äì1638) *Christian Lindsay Alexander and Ayton later represented a more anglicised stream of Scottish writing. They came to prominence more properly after the Union of the Crowns. Ayton was one of the first Scottish poets to have written explicitly in English, while Alexander wrote rhymed tragedies in a genre sometimes referred to as closet dramaAlexander's dramas include his Croesus, Darius, The Alexandrean, and Julius Caesar and were published in the years after 1604. and assisted the King in his metrical translations of the Psalms of David. Verse drama Although there is no direct record of Scottish court drama in the late 16th century, one verse play in Scots does intriguingly survive from the period, an eminently performable comedy of love, Philotus,The first ever known full production of the text was mounted by Biggar Theatre Workshop in September 1997 under the direction of Ann Matheson. See Theatre in Scots p.4 which is known today only from an anonymous edition published in London in 1603.Association of Scottish Literary Studies , Edwin Morgan, ScotLit 20, Spring 1999 Its well-developed structure and language as theatre may suggest that our picture of literary activity in the Scottish court of James is not complete. The exact identity of the dramatist is open to speculation. Context and legacy James VI saw music and court poetry as connected art-forms, employing minstrels from France, England and Italy. Scottish Jacobean writers have largely been overshadowed by the contemporaneous literary scene in London in the age of Shakespeare. Their appreciation also has been coloured by the debatable historical view that their work marked a decline and end to the tradition of the makars. The modernist Scots poet Hugh MacDiarmid, one of their detractors, dismissed their legacy in his terms as royalist and episcopalian and described their work as \\"circumscribed in outlook\\".Hugh MacDiarmid, Lucky Poet. London, 1936. p. 206 More recent critics and scholars have attempted to demonstrate the injustice of such prejudicial factors and seek a more favourable appreciation of their work.Scottish Literature: '1600 and all that' RDS Jack, The Association for Scottish Literary Studies website The full range of their prolific output has never properly been represented in modern publication and much in their writing, situated in a continuous tradition from the period of earlier writers such as Dunbar, prefigures the metaphysical poets in England. Not only are the 'Castalians' of interest in their own right as the last court poets in a purely Scottish context, but at their best, and especially when their language is correctly appraised, their proficient use of sometimes highly mannered verse forms to express complex ideas and personal emotion can stand with later popular works of figures such as Donne, Herrick and Marvell. Reulis and Cautelis King James VI's conscious desire to determine continuity in the Scottish literary tradition is evident from his 1585 prose treatise, the Reulis and Cautelis (Rules and Cautions), a treatise on Scots prosody written when he was 19. Casting himself, accurately, as an apprentice in the art of poetry, his intent was to describe the tradition and set general aesthetic and linguistic standards for Scots poetic composition. As he was well aware, his own ancestor, James I, was a principal figure in that tradition. Some of the specific tenets of the royal treatise were not always observed by the Castalians,RDS Jack observes that even James contradicted his own advice in some matters. . but its focus on language was a defining aspect for the group. James wrote elsewhere that it \\"best became a king\\" to \\"make famous his own tongue\\", and the Reulis and Cautelis seems principally designed to serve that aspiration.In Basilicon Doron.

Arthur Emil Piorkowski, married Donald V. Newhall, an artist. After growing up on Central Park South, attending the Hotchkiss School and graduating from Yale University, and being a fixture on the debutante circuit, Wagstaff joined the US Navy in 1941 as an ensign, where he took part in the D-day landing at Omaha Beach in World War II. He later worked in the field of advertising in the 1950s, which he hated. He returned to school to study Renaissance art at the New York University Institute of Fine Arts, however, and turned his energies to the art world.Detroit Metro Times: \\"Wagstaff wins\\", May 14, 2008Gaines, Catherine S., A Finding Aid to the Samuel J. Wagstaff Papers, circa 1932‚Äì1985, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. Career In 1959, a David E. Finley art history fellowship took him to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. He served as curator of contemporary art at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut from 1961 to 1968. In January, 1964, he organized the show \\"Black, White, and Gray,\\" choosing exhibits presenting what he described as \\"the sparse aesthetic shared by a number of artists whose work was pared down to a minimum\\".

Wagstaff Papers, circa 1932‚Äì1985, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. In addition to his curatorial work, Wagstaff was a noted collector, just like his father, who collected ephemera.Hilton Als, Downtown Chronicles, ‚ÄúWAGSTAFF'S EYE,‚Äù The New Yorker, January 13, 1997, p. 36 After a conflict with the Detroit Institute of Arts' board of trustees over an earthwork by Michael Heizer, which had destroyed the immaculate museum lawn, he moved back to New York. After meeting Robert Mapplethorpe in 1972 and seeing the exhibition \\"The Painterly Photograph, 1890-1914\\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1973, Wagstaff became convinced that photographs were the most unrecognized and, possibly, the most valuable works of art. He began selling his collection of paintings, using the proceeds to buy 19th- century American, British, and French photography. Then, influenced by Mapplethorpe, Wagstaff's taste veered toward the daring, and he began to depart from established names in search of new talent. His collection was soon recognized as one of the finest private holdings in the United States. In 1984 Wagstaff's photography collection went to the J. Paul Getty Museum, for a reported price in the neighborhood of $5 million. Saying he needed the challenge of building another collection, Wagstaff turned to 19th-century American silver. A show of more than 100 examples from his silver collection opened on March 20, 1987 at the New-York Historical Society. Between 1976 and 1986, Wagstaff donated his personal papers to the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. In 2008, the bulk of these papers were digitized and made available online (see the Samuel J. Wagstaff Papers, 1932‚Äì1985). Personal life Mapplethorpe's Studio in Manhattan Wagstaff met photographer Robert Mapplethorpe in 1972 at a party, beginning a fifteen-year relationship that would last until Wagstaff's death, described as \\"first a kind of marriage, sexual and artistic, then a friendship\\".ALS, Hilton Downtown Chronicles: Wagstaff's Eye The New Yorker, January 13, 1997 Mapplethorpe, whom Wagstaff called his shy pornographer, was also his guide to the gay demimonde of extreme sex and drugs that flourished in New York in the 1970s and 1980s. In the autumn of 1972, Wagstaff gave Mapplethorpe $500,000 to purchase the top-floor loft at 24 Bond Street, where the photographer lived and had his shooting space. =Death= Wagstaff died of pneumonia arising from AIDS at his home in Manhattan on January 14, 1987, two years before Mapplethorpe.Black White + Gray: A Portrait of Sam Wagstaff and Robert Mapplethorpe, a 2007 documentary film by James Crump (Movie Review By Stephen Holden, October 19, 2007, NY Times) Posthumously A fund in Wagstaff's name for the purchase of photographs was started in 1987 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art by art dealer Daniel Wolf. In 2007, James Crump directed the documentary film Black White + Gray, which premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival. In his New York Times review of the film, critic Stephen Holden wrote \\"Because Mapplethorpe's story is already familiar, the movie devotes most of its time to Wagstaff, whose personal history is a classic case of repressed or closeted homosexuality belatedly and furiously unleashed.\\" In 2014, Wagstaff: Before and After Mapplethorpe, a biography of Wagstaff, by Philip Gefter, was published by Norton/Liveright, and won the 2014 Marfield Prize for Arts Writing.Ernest Hardy, Doc of the Week  Black White + Gray, Crave, August 25, 2015  References Further reading *Crump, James, \\"Art of Acquisition: The Eye of Sam Wagstaff,\\" published in the Archives of American Art Journal Vol. 46: 3‚Äì4, Fall 2007, pages 5‚Äì13 *Hainley, Bruce, \\"The Eye of Sam Wagstaff\\", ArtForum, April 1997 *Official Movie Website for Black White + Gray: A Portrait of Sam Wagstaff and Robert Mapplethorpe, 2007, directed by James Crump *Gefter, Philip, NY Times: \\"The Man Who Made Mapplethorpe\\", April 24, 2007, NY Times *Hilton Als, Downtown Chronicles, \\"WAGSTAFF'S EYE\\", The New Yorker, January 13, 1997, p. 36 *Gefter, Philip, \\"Sam Wagstaff: The Photographist,\\" 2010, published in the Getty Research Journal No.2: pages 193-202  External links  *Archives of American Art.

From 1980 to 1984, Baird coached at East Carolina University. In 1985, he became the head coach at Auburn University where he remained until 2000. While at Auburn, he became the school's most successful head coach in history, winning a total of 634 games and he led his team to the 1994 College World Series and the 1997 College World Series. He is a member of the East Carolina University athletic Hall of Fame. Hal Baird was a standout in baseball for 15 years as a player, assistant coach and head coach at East Carolina (ECU). A 1971 ECU graduate, Baird helped the Pirates to a Southern Conference title and an NCAA Tournament appearance in 1970. In the league championship game against George Washington, Baird struck out a Southern Conference record 20 batters. His 105 strikeouts in 1971 ranks among the top performances in school history. Following his college career, Baird played for the Cleveland Indians and Kansas City Royals organizations where he earned All-Gulf Coast League, All-Florida Instructional League and All-Southern League honors. He went on to serve as an assistant coach at ECU from 1977-79 before being named head coach in 1979. Over the next five years, Baird led the Pirates to a pair of ECAC-South championships and three NCAA Tournament appearances. He finished his coaching career at East Carolina with a record of 145-66-1. His record as coach of the Auburn Tigers is 634-328-0. From 1985-2001 he won more baseball games than any coach in Auburn history. His overall coaching record is 779-394-1 (.663). Baird guided the Tigers to three NCAA Regional titles, an SEC Western Division Championship and an SEC Tournament Championship and 10 times during Baird's Auburn tenure his teams finish the season ranked in the top 25. His Auburn teams won at least 30 games in every season he was the head coach and the program participated in nine NCAA Regionals during his stay, including seven in his last eight years at Auburn. Ten Auburn players earned All-America honors under Baird's tutelage while a total of 51 players were drafted off of Baird's teams, which included Gregg Olson, Bo Jackson, Frank Thomas and Tim Hudson. In 2010 former Auburn and major league star, Frank Thomas, stated \\"Hal (Baird) always pushed me. He would always compare me to Bo (Jackson) in center field. He would say, 'Maybe if you work a little harder, you can climb that wall.' I would always say, 'Coach, there's only one Bo Jackson.' He pushed me and got me ready to play at the next level and I'm very thankful for that. I was lucky to play with Hal. He had so much experience with major leaguers that he could easily compare you and tell you what you were lacking. He really prepared me for the next level.\\" Major league pitcher Tim Hudson said, \\"When I got drafted, I thought that A-ball was a step down from SEC baseball. It wasn't quite as good as AA, but it definitely got you better for what to expect at the next level. I'm just thrilled that I had the opportunity to play here (at Auburn) and play under Coach Baird. He was vital to not only my career, but a lot of the other pitchers who came through here.\\" Baird was named head coach at Auburn in 1985 and immediately turned things around. The Tigers had suffered through three consecutive 10th-place conference finishes and one eighth-place mark in the previous four years. Auburn showed improvement with a 30-22 record in his first season and, in 1986, advanced to the SEC Tournament for the first time in six years, finishing third in the league standings. By 1987 Baird had led the Tigers to a 42-18 mark and an 18-9 conference record with a third-place finish in the SEC. Both the overall and conference wins set new Auburn records for a single season, both of which he topped later on in his career. Baird's 1995 team not only won 40 games, but it did so quicker than any team in SEC history, taking just 45 games to reach that accomplishment. Auburn won the SEC Western Division en route to finishing with a school-best record of 50-13 and, for the first time in school history, the 1995 Tigers were the No. 1 seed at an NCAA Regional and spent part of the season as the top-ranked team in the country. During the 1990s, Baird's teams won 68.1 percent of their games. Baird pitched professionally from 1971‚Äì1976, with 4 of those years at the AAA level. He was inducted into the Alabama Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2006. In July of 2020 the American Baseball Coaches Association announced that Hal would be inducted into their Hall of Fame as part of the induction class of 2021. He grew up in Virginia and was a multi-sport letterman at Prince George High School. He has been married to his high school sweetheart, the former Janie Megee, since 1972.

Antunes served as royal architect during the reign of King Pedro II of Portugal and is responsible a number of famous landmarks in Lisbon, such as the National Pantheon at Santa Engr√°cia, and the tomb of Saint Joana, Princess of Portugal. Biography Jo√£o Antunes was born in Braga, in the province of Minho, and, presumably received some sort of education while restoring the Ribeira Palace during the Philippine Dinasty. Antunes was appointed royal architect (arquitecto Real) in 1699. His main work is the Church of Santa Engr√°cia (started 1682) in Lisbon, a Greek cross building with curved fa√ßades typical of the Baroque architecture of Borromini. Antunes was also responsible for the projects for the Church of Saint El√≥i (built after 1694, destroyed in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake) and the Church of Menino Deus (1711‚Äì1737), both in Lisbon. These churches had the shape of a rectangle with angled edges, thus assuming the shape of an irregular octagon. This floorplan scheme, possibly derived from designs by Guarino Guarini, would greatly influence other churches in Portugal and colonial Brazil. All of these churches were decorated with marble panels of Italian influence, anticipating the dominant role that Roman art would have in the Portuguese court during the 18th century. Antunes was also responsible for the Church of Bom Jesus of Barcelos, started in 1704. The innovative floorplan of this church consists of a Greek cross church (an influence of Santa Engr√°cia) inserted into a hexagon with four sides of round shape. Another work by Antunes in northern Portugal was the renovation of the sacristy of Braga Cathedral. Jo√£o Antunes also designed several Baroque altarpieces for the private chapels of the nobility and churches like the Santo Ant√£o Church in Lisbon and the Chapel of Saint Vincent in Lisbon Cathedral (the latter was lost in the 1755 earthquake). Another notable work is the large tomb constructed for Princess Joana in the Convent of Jesus in Aveiro. The tomb consists of a large central chest with cherubs supporting the royal arms at top. All of these works were made of polychromed marble of Italian influence.

It was notable for the challenge of Winston Churchill to the party system. Vacancy The seat had become vacant when the Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) John Nicholson died on 21 February 1924. Nicholson had held the seat since a 1921 by-election. Candidates Winston Churchill quickly announced his candidature. He had lost his seat of Dundee in the 1922 general election as a National Liberal follower of David Lloyd George. In 1923 following reconciliation between Lloyd George and H. H. Asquith at the 1923 general election he had stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal candidate. He favoured the restoration of a coalition between Liberals and Unionists. He stood in the Westminster Abbey by-election as a \\"Constitutionalist\\" and received unofficial Unionist support. At first it seemed Churchill would be officially supported by the Unionists' local organisation the Westminster Abbey Constitutional Association, but they decided to nominate their own candidate, Otho Nicholson, the nephew of the former member. The Labour Party selected Fenner Brockway. Churchill had hoped that his candidature might have been endorsed by the Abbey Liberal Association or have received the backing of Liberal leader Asquith, but the local Liberals adopted John Scott Duckers. In fact, Abbey Liberals stated that Scott Duckers name would only go forward if Churchill was a candidate. Churchill thus found his candidature opposed by candidates of all three main political parties. Party prospectsUnionist= The official Unionist candidate had been elected after each of the 4 previous contests since the seat was created in 1918. Two of those contest were unopposed returns. Of the other two, the 1922 contests saw them poll a massive 75.6% of the vote. In the fourth contest, the 1921 by-election, the Unionist vote was split but the official Unionist still managed to poll 43.6%. =Labour= Only once before had a Labour candidate stood, in the 1922 elections when they polled 13.6 percent. In that election their candidate had to compete for the anti-Unionist vote with an Independent candidate with Liberal leanings. A more active Labour party campaign might hope to poll much better but without the expectation of winning. =Liberal= The only election the Liberals had contested was the 1921 by-election when their candidate had garnered all the anti-Unionist vote in polling 21.5%. In 1922 the Independent candidate was thought to have won only Liberal support in polling 10.8%. A campaign lacking the intensity of the Liberal campaign run in 1921 would not be treated seriously. =Constitutionalist= The 1921 by- election had shown a willingness among the mass Unionist electorate to vote for an unofficial candidate. However, both Unionists standing in that election were standing on a ticket opposed to the Coalition government that Churchill was advocating. It would take a personality like that of Churchill to have any chance of winning. Campaign Unionist MPs chaired each of Churchill's election committees. The Beaverbrook and Rothermere newspapers supported his candidature. Unionist leader Stanley Baldwin stayed officially neutral. When leading Unionist Leo Amery campaigned against Churchill and in favour of Nicholson, Baldwin allowed another leading Unionist Arthur Balfour to release a public letter to the press supporting Churchill.Robert Rhodes James Churchill: A Study in Failure p 195-198 Pelican 1973 Celebrity sportsmen, jockey Steve Donoghue and boxer Jimmy Wilde publicly supported Churchill.Trial By Ballot by Ivor RM Davies, p73-74 The Labour party supporting Daily Herald ran stories on 'Wealthy Westminster Housing Scandal' in an effort to appeal to the working class part of the constituency living in bad housing.By-Elections in British Politics, Cook and Ramsden, p53-61 Result The Unionist candidate Otho Nicholson held the seat for the party. Nicholson won by just 43 votes over Churchill; Duckers, Brockway & Nicholson Churchill had come close to defeating the party machines. The extent of his support was mainly due to the backing he received from significant sections of the London press who backed him as a personality rather than in support for a Unionist/Liberal coalition. Aftermath The action of the Abbey Liberal Association in opposing Churchill marked the parting of the ways between the Liberal party and a man who was, after Lloyd George, the most popular individual in the party.Trial By Ballot by Ivor RM Davies, p73-74 At the 1924 general election, Nicholson held the seat as the only Unionist candidate. Churchill was re- elected to Parliament elsewhere as a Constitutionalist, one of only a handful of candidates to win election under that label. Brockway later became a Labour MP for Leyton East.

The location of the Turcilingi is only a guess. The Turcilingi (also spelled Torcilingi or Thorcilingi) were an obscure barbarian people, or possibly a clan or dynasty, who appear in historical sources relating to Middle Danubian peoples who were present in Italy during the reign of Romulus Augustulus (475‚Äì76). Their only known leader was Odoacer (Odovacar), who was however described as a ruler of several ethnic groups. Although various origins have been proposed including Hunnic, recent research favors the idea that the Turcilingi might be identical to the Thuringii who are first mentioned in association with a type of horse, known to the Romans, only becoming politically important after the fall of Odoacar. Primary sources The Turcilingi are mentioned in only one independent source: they appear three times in the works of Jordanes, twice in his Getica and once in his Romana. They are also mentioned once in the Historia Langobardorum of Paul the Deacon in a passage that is a derivative of Jordanes and once in the Historia Miscella of Landulf Sagax in a passage derived from Paul. Johann Kaspar Zeuss, followed by Karl V. M√ºllenhoff, believed that the 'Œ°ŒøœÖœÑŒØœáŒªŒµŒπŒøŒπ (Routikleioi) mentioned in the Geographia of Ptolemy (II.11.7) were the Turcilingi, but this thesis requires a complex etymology. Landulf Sagax lists them together with the Scirii among the nations which participated on the side of Attila and the Huns at the Battle of Ch√¢lons.Reynolds and Lopez (1946), p. 38. Jordanes speaks of the Turcilingi, though he makes no mention of them at Ch√¢lons. The Turcilingi were joined with several other barbarian tribes, like the Scirii, Rugii, and Heruli, under Odoacer as foederati of the Western Roman Emperor Romulus Augustulus, who was a puppet of his father, Flavius Orestes. The barbarians demanded from Orestes in return for their military service some Italian land on which to settle. They were denied. According to Jordanes: When Theodoric the Great was looking for a pretext to invade Italy in 493, he petitioned the Eastern Roman Emperor Zeno by reminding him of the \\"tyranny\\" (unlawful rule) of the city of Rome by Turcilingi and Rugii.Theodoric's charge against the Turcilingi had resonance. As late as the 17th century, Lancelot Andrewes found use for citing the \\"inhumanity\\" and barbarity of the Turcilingi in his Gunpowder Plot Sermon. According to Jordanes, Theodoric gave the following justification: Reynolds and Lopez note that Jordanes consistently writes the word often translated as \\"Rugii\\", the name of a Middle Danubian Germanic people, with an \\"o\\" and not a \\"u\\" when referring to Odoacer. They compare the third mention, in the Romana (344) which describes him as \\"genere Rogus\\" which could be read as \\"offspring of a person named Rogus\\". Reynolds and Lopez connect this to the fact that Rogus was recorded as the name of an uncle of Attila, and point out that \\"regis Torcilingorum Rogorumque\\", though it looks like it refers to two tribes, is notable for not referring to any of the better-known peoples Odoacer is normally associated with ruling, such as the Scirii or Heruli, and propose that Odoacer is being described by Jordanes as a \\"Torcilingi-king, of the stock of Rogus, with Sciri and Herul followers\\". Fredegar, writing in the middle of the 7th century, cites the Torci as living in eastern Europe. Claude Cahen argued that these were a remnant of the Turcilingi. Paul the Deacon, in his opening chapter,I.1 names several peoples (Vandals, Rugii, Heruli, Turcilingi) who have come, he says, from Germania to Italy. He goes on to name the Lombards as latecomers from the same region. This passage is clearly based on Jordanes, but its reference to Germany is unique. Nonetheless, Paul does not say that the Turcilingi are Germans, but only where they came from: \\"The Goths indeed, and the Wandals, the Rugii, Heroli, and Turcilingi, and also other fierce and barbarous nations have come from Germany.\\" Identification From the sources it is not possible to infer the origin of Turcilingi. The Turcilingi are generally considered to have been a Germanic tribe. ... \\"the problem of the Turcilingi should be mentioned; this is a tribal group found along with Germanic groups, apparently always East- Germanic ones, which is usually considered to be itself Germanic.\\" By one 19th century account, the Turcilingi appear to have originated in Germany, perhaps near the Baltic Sea,This is where Zeuss places them, with the Rugii. and thence moved with the Huns into Gaul and finally to the Danube, possibly Noricum, before entering Italy with Odoacer. It was often assumed that they were an Eastern Germanic people related to the Scirii, or at least connected to the Scirii by special affinity.Johann Kaspar Zeuss, Die Deutschen und die Nachbarstamme. Munchen: Lentner, 1837 Nineteenth-century German scholarship thus supposed that the Turcilingi were neighbours of (or the same people as) the Scirii in the first century, or that they were the royal clan of the Scirii or the Huns. The more enthusiastic invented a homeland for them straddling the Oder, with the Scirii to the east, the Vandals to the west, and the Rugii to the north. These scholars placed them in the Gothic mouvance. More recently, Herwig Wolfram has continued to classify the Turcilingi as a Germanic tribe, and supports the notion that they were the royal clan of the Scirii. Still more recently, they have been identified with the Thuringii by Wolfram Brandes and Helmut Castritius, and this conclusion has begun to gain more acceptance, including Walter Pohl and Peter Heather. The reasoning is based on upon the facts that the Suda describes Odoacer's brother Onoulphus as a Thuringian on his father's side and Scirian on his mother's. The Thuringian identity of Odoacer's father is denied in the Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire. Hyun Jin Kim thinks the Suda contains a hypercorrection by a scribe who did not recognise the Turcilingi. Jordanes refers to both peoples. Kim argues that they were \\"a Turkic-speaking tribe under Hunnic rule ... probably of mixed origin ... with possibly a Germanic and Turkic (Hunnic) mixture.\\" Cahen, too, argued they were Turkic-speaking Huns. Etymology The problem of identification is related to the problem of etymology. Both are related to the question whether the Turcilingi were Germanic or not. The root Turci- has led some scholars to suggest that they were a Turkic-speaking tribe. The -ling suffix is Germanic, denoting members of a line, usually one descended from a common ancestor. Kim believes the name is a Germanization of Turkic name. ReferencesSources *Cahen, Claude (1973). \\"Fr√©degaire et les Turcs\\".

Family  Heine emigrated to New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1843, where he married Am√©lie Marie C√©leste Miltenberger, born 25 May 1832 in New Orleans. Together with his brother Armand, they founded the famous Bankhaus Armand & Michel Heine in 1883, with Rothschild-Fr√®res & Co. in Paris and New Orleans.  Banque Fould and Banque Heine  In 1795, Beer L√©on Fould founded a bank whose name would change repeatedly, from B L Fould and Fould Oppenheim, to Fould Oppenheim und Co., and eventually to Fould Co. In 1883, Armand and Michel Heine, having previously been partners in Fould & Co, founded their family bank under their own names. The new enterprise became extremely successful. The bank was already involved in numerous transactions in Spain under its old name, regarding investment in the railways. After the emergence of the US business and the end of the American Civil War, the growing business' opportunities in Europe extended. Due to its French and German ties, and extensive network of branches in the Eastern United States of America, the bank was securely set up. In 1891, the bank made a number of purchases, including the Panama Railway. After the American Civil War, the Heines returned to France with their daughter Marie Alice (who was 16 years old), and fitted successfully into society as realtors and architects. They also acquired a reputation as constructors for luxury villas in the style of French castles in and around Paris. Michel and Am√©lie Marie lived in the Heine residence at 21, Rue Hoche in Paris. Michel invested in business, including in cotton, and supported the French regent Louis XVIII. Michel Heine died in Paris; after their deaths, both Michel and Am√©lie Marie were buried in the family tomb in the cemetery at Richelieu.

Although they have not been built yet, some futurists have been giving considerable thought to the concepts involved. High-population-density cities, to be built near the Arctic Rim and in Antarctica, New Zealand, Tasmania, and Patagonia, with sustainable energy and transportation infrastructure, will require substantial nearby agriculture. Boreal soils are largely poor in key nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, but nitrogen-fixing plants (such as the various alders) with the proper symbiotic microbes and mycorrhizal fungi can likely remedy such poverty without the need for petroleum-derived fertilizers. Regional probiotic soil improvement should perhaps rank high on any polar cities priority list. James Lovelock's notion of a widely distributed almanac of science knowledge and post-industrial survival skills also appears to have value.  History  The polar cities climate retreat living pod concept is a worst-case scenario prediction\\"We should plan for the worst-case climate scenario\\" Ken Caldeira, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists 29 July 2008 based on the ideas of British chemist and inventor James Lovelock: life in polar cities\\"‚ÄúPolar Cities‚Äù is an idea whose time I hope never comes\\" arrayed inland and around the shores of an ice-free Arctic Ocean in a greenhouse-warmed world. Dr. Lovelock, who in 1972 conceived of the Earth's crust, climate, and veneer of life as a unified self-sustaining entity,Gaia hypothesis foresees humanity in full pole-bound retreat within a century as areas around the tropics roast ‚Äî a scenario far outside even the worst-case projections of climate scientists. After reading a newspaper column\\"James Lovelock: The Earth is about to catch a morbid fever that may last as long as 100,000 years\\", The Independent 16 January 2006 in 2006 in which Dr. Lovelock predicted disastrous warming, Danny Bloom, a freelance newspaper reporter and climate blogger, teamed up with Deng Cheng-hong, a Taiwanese artist, and set up websites showing designs for self-sufficient Arctic communities.\\"Global Warming and Polar Cities\\" Mr. Bloom's intent is to conduct a non-threatening thought experiment that might prod people out of their comfort zone on climate change.  Popular culture  In 2012, two books about polar cities were published. Polar City Red, by Jim Laughter, is a climate fiction novel about life in a polar city in the year 2075 in Alaska. Polar City Dreaming: How Climate Change Might Usher In The Age Of Polar Cities, by Stephan Malone, is a nonfiction history of polar city ideas.  Design  The design of polar cities climate retreat living pods is currently (2008) driven entirely by volunteers under the name of \\"The Polar City Project\\". Danny Bloom is currently leading this effort. The defining design characteristics are efficiency, both for operational costs as well as construction costs, and a desire for the city to be a Zero energy building.

Some Pirate Cinema groups perceive their actions within a political context, by deliberately screening copyrighted movies, or movies that document the current copyright debate. In connection with showing copyrighted movies the Pirate Cinema group in Helsinki had confrontation with the local police. Pirate Cinema groups are also active in Amsterdam, Stockholm, Paris and London.pirate cinema berlin  Brazil  The first pirate cinema initiative in Brazil was Cine Falcatrua (\\"Cine Hoax\\"), an academic film society based on the state of Esp√≠rito Santo.VJ Theory: Cine Falcatrua Cine Falcatrua started its activities around 2003, downloading movies from P2P networks and screening them in open weekly sessions on the whereabouts of the Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo.Videoclube Falcatrua video documentation Most of the movies were exhibited by the film society long before they officially got into Brazilian movie theaters. Some of them, like Kill Bill and Fahrenheit 9/11, were screened more than two months before their official release. They were subtitled in Brazilian Portuguese by the very members of Cine Falcatrua. On June 2004, the University that hosted the project was prosecuted by a couple Brazilian film companies that held the rights to distribute these films in national territory. Nevertheless, the film society did not stop its activities. On October 2009, the Growing Minds Project started \\"Cinema Pirata S√£o Paulo\\", another initiative to encourage free screenings and the popularization of free culture in Brazil. They promote free screenings in many places, theatres, streets, parks, etc., promoting free culture and conscience on the Intellectual Property revolution.

He attended University College, Oxford, where, in his rooms, the historic meeting between Robert Southey and Coleridge took place. He was also an associate of Hazlitt and William Godwin, and a number of scholars have speculated that he was responsible for the acquaintance of Lamb and William Godwin. Coleridge lamented in a letter that Godwin was having a negative influence on Allen and had cause him to become a religious sceptic. Allen married a widow much older than himself who had children as old as he was. Lamb is known to have strongly objected to the marriage. Sadly for Allen his wife died shortly after they were married. In 1797 Allen was appointed Deputy Surgeon of the Second Royal Dragoons in Portugal. And in 1802 he spent time in the Lake District with John Stoddart, the brother-in-law of William Hazlitt.

The railway vehicle was designed and built in 1835 by the British railway pioneers George and Robert Stephenson in the English city of Newcastle. It was delivered to the Bavarian Ludwig Railway (Bayerische Ludwigsbahn) for service between Nuremberg and F√ºrth. It ran officially for the first time there on 7 December 1835. The Adler was a steam locomotive of the Patentee type with a wheel arrangement of 2-2-2 (Whyte notation) or 1A1 (UIC classification). The Adler was equipped with a tender of type 2 T 2\\\\.  History  Earlier locomotives in Germany = The Adler is often cited as the very first locomotive used by a railway company on German soil, but as early as 1816 a serviceable steam locomotive was designed by the Royal Prussian Steelworks (K√∂niglich Preu√üische Eisengie√üerei) in Berlin. During a trial run this so- called Krigar locomotive hauled one railway wagon with a payload of 8,000 German pounds (about ). But this vehicle was never used commercially.Bulletin about the Berlin steam locomotive that was to be used in a coal mine in the Saar (German)Report on the Berlin steam engine, that was to have been used in a coal mine in the Saar (German) Nevertheless, the Adler was undoubtedly the first successfully operated locomotive in regular use in Germany. = Origin = Bill for the Adler of the Bavarian Ludwig Railway, issued by the locomotive factory Robert Stephenson and Company on 27 August 1835 During the construction of the Bavarian Ludwig Railway, founded by Georg Zacharias Platner, the search for a suitable locomotive started in England. The first letter of enquiry was sent via the London company, Suse und Libeth, to Robert Stephenson & Co. and Braithwaite & Ericsson. The locomotive was to be able to pull a weight of ten metric tons and cover the distance between Nuremberg and F√ºrth in a time of eight to ten minutes. Carriages were heated with charcoal. Stephenson replied that a locomotive of the same build class as those on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, with four wheels and a weight of between 7.5 and 8 metric tons, could be supplied. A lighter engine would not have the necessary power of adhesion and would be more expensive than a heavier engine. In any case, on 16 June 1833, Johannes Scharrer asked for a quote for two locomotives with a weight of 6.5 metric tons and the necessary package of accessories. Stephenson quoted a cost of about 1,800 pounds sterling. The German company, Holmes and Rolandson from Unterkochen near Aalen, offered a steam locomotive with a power of between two and six horsepower at a price of 4,500 Gulden. Negotiations with Holmes and Rolandson stalled, and this avenue of enquiry was dropped. A further bid came from Josef Reaullaux located in Eschweiler, near Aachen. At the end of April, Platner and Mainberger from Nuremberg were in Neuwied near Cologne. There they wanted to award a contract for the railway track. On 28 April they travelled to Cologne to meet with a friend of Platner called Consul Bartls. Bartls told them about the Belgian engineering works of Cockerill in Li√®ge. As a result, Platner and Mainberger travelled to Li√®ge. There they discovered that Cockerill had not yet built a locomotive, though they did find Stephenson was in Brussels at that time. They reached Brussels on 1 May and stayed in a guesthouse in Flanders, where Stephenson and several of his engineers were staying. Stephenson wanted to be present at the opening of the railway line from Brussels to Mechelen which was scheduled for 5 May. On 3 May, both parties signed a letter of intent. Stephenson wanted to deliver a locomotive of the Patentee type with six wheels and a weight of about six metric tons for a price of between 750 and 800 pounds sterling. On 15 May 1835 the new locomotive was ordered from Stephenson's locomotive works in Newcastle upon Tyne to those specifications. Furthermore, a tender for a bogie passenger coach and a goods wagon were ordered. Later it turned out that the locomotive would cost about 900 pounds sterling instead of the sum quoted in Brussels. Stephenson originally promised in Brussels that the locomotive would be delivered by the end of July to RotterdamMarkus Hehl: Der \\"Adler\\" - Deutschlands erste Dampflokomotive. Weltbild, Augsburg 2008, p. 32. Different units of measurement were used in Nuremberg and England; the English foot and the bavarian foot were different. The track gauge was predefined to be the same as that of the Stockton and Darlington Railway which was . Stephenson persisted with this gauge which meant the existing track had to be relaid, because its track gauge was too narrow by 5/8 inches. The delivery of the locomotive to Nuremberg, together with all its spares comprising over 100 individual components in 19 boxes with a total weight of 177 hundredweight, came to a cost of 1,140 pounds, 19 shillings und 3 pennies. The boxes were shipped late, on 3 September 1835, on the ship Zoar from London to Rotterdam. The freight rate from Rotterdam to Cologne was 700 francs, from Cologne to Offenbach am Main 507 South German gulden and 9 kreuzer and from Offenbach to Nuremberg 653 gulden and 11 kreuzer. The board of directors of the Bavarian Ludwig Railway wanted the purchase to be exempted from import duty. The locomotive was declared as an item of a formerly unknown product which was to be used by factories in the Bavarian interior. After several difficulties the Ministry of Finance approved the tax-free import with Johann Wilhelm Spaeth as the recipient of the consignment.Wolfgang M√ºck: Deutschlands erste Eisenbahn mit Dampfkraft. Die kgl. priv. Ludwigseisenbahn zwischen N√ºrnberg und F√ºrth. F√ºrth 1985, p. 115‚Äì126. The transport boxes containing the locomotive were shipped by the barge van Hees (owned by its captain, van Hees) and pulled upriver by the steamboat Hercules on the Rhine until it reached Cologne.Peter Heigl: Adler ‚Äì Stationen einer Lokomotive im Laufe dreier Jahrhunderte. Buch & Kunstverlag Oberpfalz, Amberg 2009, , pp. 37‚Äì38 As the waterline in the Rhine was low, Captain van Hees had to use horses to pull the barge instead of the steamboat, as originally planned. On 7 October, the train of barges reached Cologne; the remaining distance to Nuremberg had to be covered by road because the Main was too shallow to be navigable by barge. The transport on land was disrupted by a strike of the freight forwarders in Offenbach am Main, and a different freight forwarder had to be ordered. On 26 October 1835 the transport reached Nuremberg. The steam engine was assembled in the workshops of the Johann Wilhelm Spaeth engineering works, with the assembly being observed by Stephenson's engineer William Wilson, who had travelled with the locomotive to Nuremberg. They used the help of the technical teacher Bauer and local carpenters. On 10 November 1835, the board of directors of the Bavarian Ludwig Railway expressed their hope that the locomotive would be serviceable soon. The locomotive was a symbol for power, daringness and rapidity.Peter Heigl: Adler ‚Äì Stationen einer Lokomotive im Laufe dreier Jahrhunderte. Buch & Kunstverlag Oberpfalz, Amberg, 2009, , p. 30 Both bogies delivered by Robert Stephenson & Co. turned out as too heavy for use at Nuremberg. The German constructor Denis had planned that the railway wagons should be pulled either from the steam locomotive, or from horses, making a lighter construction necessary. Several companies built the wagons: * the bogies were produced by Sp√§th, Gemeiner und Manhard; * the wooden coachwork were delivered by the wheelwright Stahl from Nuremberg. As these companies were used to capacity with different orders three bogies and 16 wheels were produced by the company Stein in Lohr near Aschaffenburg. Denis threatened these companies to place future orders in England if they would not work faster. At the end of August 1835 the first wagon was completed. In the second half of October that year, the further wagons were nearing completion, with nine wagons produced before the opening of the Bavarian Ludwig Railway. The wagons consisted of two wagons for third class passengers, four for second class and three for first class. On 21 October 1835, the first test run with one horse-pulled wagon took place. Denis had constructed a brake for the wagons which was tested at this opportunity. The wagon could be stopped in each situation without any effort by the horse. On 16 November, the first test run of the steam locomotive from Nuremberg to F√ºrth and back again was accomplished. Due to the cold weather that day, the speed was slowed down. Three days later five fully occupied wagons were transported on the track in between 12 and 13 minutes. On the way back the brakes and also boarding and disembarking of the passengers were tested. During the following tests it was discovered if wood was burned in the locomotive the sparks which came out of the chimney of the locomotive singed the clothing of the passengers. The participation at the test run costed 36 kreuzers, and the revenues from this were donated to the welfare of the poor. = Construction and bodywork =  Locomotive  The Adler was built on a wooden framework which was covered with sheet metal. Both wet steam driven cylinders were placed horizontally inside the frame and drove the driving wheelset which was placed in the middle of the three axles. The driving wheels had no wheel flange, so the locomotive could be operated on small radius curves. The forged spokes were rivetted to the rim. The original wheels were made of cast iron and were encircled with a forged tyre made of wrought iron. The original wheels made of brittle cast iron were replaced later through wheels made of wrought iron. The hollow spokes had a core made of wood to make them more flexible to cushion unevenness of the track. All wheels of the locomotive were unbraked. A mechanical railway brake braked both wheels of the tender on the right side where the fireman was located. There was a fixed connection between the locomotive and the tender. The buffers were made of wood. The horseshoe-shaped water box surrounded the coal stored in the tender. At first coke was burned in the firebox, later bituminous coal was used.Peter Heigl: Adler ‚Äì Stationen einer Lokomotive im Laufe dreier Jahrhunderte. Buch & Kunstverlag Oberpfalz, Amberg 2009, , p. 25‚Äì26.Georg Rebenstein: Stephenson's Locomotive auf der Ludwigs-Eisenbahn von Nuernberg nach Fuerth. Nuremberg, 1836.  Railway coaches  The passenger wagons had the same bodies that were used for horse-drawn carriages. They were mounted on a bogie made of iron. The shape of coup√©-carriages with two axles and three separated compartments in line was the archetype for the first German railway wagons. Specific bogies for passenger coaches were first developed in 1842 by the Great Western Railway. All wagons were painted in yellow which was the colour of stagecoaches at that time. The third class wagons originally had no roof, three compartments with eight to ten seats and the entrances had no doors. The second class wagons had originally a roof made of canvas, had doors, unglazed windows and curtains originally made of silk later made of leather. All wagons were of the same width but from the cheapest to the most expensive class the number of seats in one line were reduced by one. The first class wagons were lined with a precious blue foulard, had windows made of glass, the door handles gilded and all metal fittings were made of brass. The second class wagon No 8 which still exists was rebuilt between 1838 and 1846, it has a length of 5,740 mm, a weight of about 5 t and has 24 seats. = Operation and retirement = Photo of the Adler made in the early 1850s Wooden second class passenger wagon No 8 of the Bavarian Ludwig Railway (built 1835, rebuilt between 1838 and 1846) in the Nuremberg Transport Museum On 7 December 1835 the Adler, driven by William Wilson, ran for the first time on the 6.05 kilometres long track of the LudwigsbahnUlrich Scheefold: 150 Jahre Eisenbahnen in Deutschland. Munich, 1985, p. 9. in nine minutes. 200 guests of honour were on the train and 26-year-old Scotsman William Wilson was in the cab. In time intervals of two hours two more test runs were made. The locomotive was in use with up to nine wagons with 192 passengers as a maximum. In normal use it drove at a maximum speed of 28 km/h because the locomotive should be preserved. The normal run time was about 14 minutes. Demonstration trial could be done at a maximum speed of 65 km/h. In most cases horses were used as working animals instead of the steam locomotive. Because the coal was first very expensive most services were done as a horsecar. Goods were transported additionally to the passengers beginning from the year 1839. One of the first goods which were transported were beer barrels and cattle. In 1845 there was a considerable transport of goods. After running successfully for twenty-two years the Adler was now the weakest locomotive on the European continent. Moreover, the consumption of coal of newer steam engines was much more efficient until then. The locomotive was used in Nuremberg as a stationary steam engine. 1858 the railway company sold the locomotive with the tender but minus its wheels and further accessories to the iron dealer Mr. Director Riedinger located in Augsburg.Peter Heigl: Adler ‚Äì Stationen einer Lokomotive im Laufe dreier Jahrhunderte. Buch & Kunstverlag Oberpfalz, Amberg 2009, , p. 54. A probably unique photograph of the Adler taken around 1851, and probably the only one in existence, is in the Nuremberg city archives (Stadtarchiv N√ºrnberg).Adler_home.html Der \\"Adler\\". auf: N√ºrnberg online. However, neither the age of the photograph is documented definitely nor is known if the picture shows the original locomotive or only a model. The second class passenger wagon No 8, built in 1835 and rebuilt between 1838 and 1846, was preserved because Ludwig I of Bavaria is supposed to have travelled in it.  Replicas  Serviceable replica of 1935 = Adler at the Eiserner Steg on the Frankfurt City Link Line in Frankfurt am Main, May 1985 Adler (1935 replica) in Nuremberg in 1999 In 1925 the establishment of the Nuremberg Transport Museum was planned. It was decided that the Adler, which had been scrapped in 1855, should be reconstructed. The exact plans from that era were lost. Only one engraving from the time of the historical Adler provided information. In 1929 these plans were halted by the Great Depression. To celebrate the centenary of the railways in Germany in 1935, a replica of the Adler was built beginning from 1933 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in the Kaiserslautern repair shop (Ausbesserungswerk), which was largely true to the original. The original idea of the President of the Reichsbahn Julius Dorpm√ºller and the members of his staff was to use the Adler-replica as an instrument of propaganda for the \\"new era\\" in the city of the Reichsparteitag Nuremberg. They planned to contrast the Adler with modern gigantic steam locomotives like the high-speed DRG Class 05. For the realisation of the replica they used the results of the planning in 1925. Besides of different technical data the replica differed from the original with thicker boiler casing and additional cross bracings and spokes wheels made of steel.Peter Heigl: Adler ‚Äì Stationen einer Lokomotive im Laufe dreier Jahrhunderte. Buch & Kunstverlag Oberpfalz, Amberg 2009, , p. 57‚Äì59. The replica attained an average speed of 33.7 km/h in tests on an 81 kilometre stretch of line. The route had gradients of between 1:110 and 1:140. From 14 July until 13 October 1935 visitors could travel with the reconstructed Adler-train on a track length of two kilometres on the area of the centenary exhibition in Nuremberg. On the driving cab were also the President of the Deutsche Reichsbahn Julius Dorpm√ºller and the Gauleiter of Franconia Julius Streicher. The Adler-replica was in use after that in 1936 at the Cannstatter Wasen in Stuttgart and during the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. During the 100-years-jubilee of the first Prussian railway in 1938 the Adler-train was in service between Berlin and Potsdam. After this event the Adler-train was sent to the Nuremberg Transport Museum. In 1950 the Adler-train was displayed by the Deutsche Bundesbahn on a street transport vehicle for rolling stock during a parade of the 900-years- jubilee of Nuremberg.Peter Heigl: Adler ‚Äì Stationen einer Lokomotive im Laufe dreier Jahrhunderte. Buch & Kunstverlag Oberpfalz, Amberg 2009, , p. 69. For the 125th anniversary of the railway in Germany the Adler-train was in service on the track of the tram between Nuremberg (Pl√§rrer place) and F√ºrth Hauptbahnhof. The inner sides of the wheels were needed to turned of for operating on the tram track.Peter Heigl: Adler ‚Äì Stationen einer Lokomotive im Laufe dreier Jahrhunderte. Buch & Kunstverlag Oberpfalz, Amberg 2009, , p. 77 ff. In 1984 it was rebuilt for the 150th anniversary by the Deutsche Bundesbahn in the Offenburg repair shop. The inner sides of the wheels which were turned of in 1960 for driving on a tram track had to welded again. The steam boiler was checked under notice of current safety regulations. The Adler was displayed on the great jubilee exhibition in Nuremberg and took part of numerous events in west Germany like for example in Hamburg, Konstanz and Munich. On 22 May 1984 it was used for public tours between N√ºrnberg Hauptbahnhof and Nuremberg East.Peter Heigl: Adler ‚Äì Stationen einer Lokomotive im Laufe dreier Jahrhunderte. Buch & Kunstverlag Oberpfalz, Amberg 2009, , p. 99‚Äì123. The locomotive was out of service from 1985 until 1999. For the planned services in 1999 it had to be refurbished during several months. On 16 September 1999 the Federal Railway Authority gave the approval of operation.\\"R√ºckkehr des Adler\\". In: Eisenbahn-Revue International. Heft 11, Jahrgang 1999, , p. 456f. For the 100th anniversary of the Bavarian Railway Museum and the successor Nuremberg Transport Museum in 1999 the Adler-train was in service at three Sundays in October and took part in the great parade of rolling stock at the Nuremberg classification yard. In the following years the Adler-train was used for several classic railway tours in Germany.Peter Heigl: Adler ‚Äì Stationen einer Lokomotive im Laufe dreier Jahrhunderte. Buch & Kunstverlag Oberpfalz, Amberg 2009, , p. 125 It stood in the Nuremberg Transport Museum until 2005 when it was damaged by fire.eisenbahn magazin 1/2008, S. 9 At a fire in the museum's roundhouse at the Nuremberg West locomotive depot on 17 October 2005, which at that time contained 24 locomotives, the still-working Adler replica was one of many engines that were badly damaged. Nevertheless, the management of the Deutsche Bahn decided to restore it. The wreck was lifted from the ruins of the roundhouse on 7 November by a mobile crane in a four-hour operation by a recovery gang from the Pre√ünitz Valley Railway and taken by special low-loader to the Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works. It was discovered that the boiler at least, thanks to its being full of water, was relatively undamaged, although its entire wooden cladding had been burnt and many plates had melted, and it could therefore be used for the reconstruction in 2007. = Reconstruction in a serviceable state in 2007 = DB Museum in Koblenz-L√ºtzel The reconstruction started in mid- April 2007 and was finished by the October.Photo gallery on the subject \\"Adler wieder unter Dampf\\" (Adler in steam again') Th√ºringer Allgemeinen newspaper of 24.10.2007 The metal-sheathed wooden frame was however so badly damaged, that it had to be completely built from scratch. A third-class wagon that had been stored at a different location and so had survived the fire, served as a template for the new coach-like wagons that were built by a Meiningen carpenter's shop. The cost ran to about a million euros, of which 200,000 euros was donated by the public.Reconstruction of the historic \\"Adler\\" train has started The director of the DB Museum Nuremberg assuaged fears before the reconstruction began that the rebuilding work would not be able to replicate the details of the locomotive damaged by the fire and explained: \\"No compromises will be made!\\" It was even more accurately built by using historical drawings, so for example the reconstruction of the chimney damaged in the fire was not based on the 1935 replica, but on the original design. The biggest problem was the one-piece driving axle. This could not be made in the Meiningen works, so at short notice the company Gr√∂dlitzer Kurbelwelle Wildau GmbH was found which could carry out the work. For the frame of the locomotive between eight and twelve years seasoned wood from fraxinus-trees was used. This was flexible enough for vibrations by the power transmission during a run. The base frame of the tender was built from hard wood taken from oak- trees.Peter Heigl: Adler ‚Äì Stationen einer Lokomotive im Laufe dreier Jahrhunderte. Buch & Kunstverlag Oberpfalz, Amberg 2009, , p. 148. On 23 November 2007 the restored Adler returned to display at the museum together with an old third class wagon from 1935 and two new ones from 2007 in a locomotive shed near the Nuremberg Transport Museum. In the museum the non- serviceable replica from 1950 is displayed and also the original second class 1835 built and 1838 and 1846 rebuilt passenger wagon No 8 of the Bavarian Ludwig Railway which has not been put on track again because of conservation reasons. On 26 April 2008 the replica was in use between Nuremberg and F√ºrth accompanied by German members of parliament of various parties, a member of the DB management board and the Bavarian minister-president, Beckstein. In May special runs in Nuremberg, Koblenz and Halle (Saale) were following during the summer. In April 2010 during the 175th anniversary of the railway in Germany the Adler was in use of the area of the DB Museum in Koblenz-L√ºtzel. In May and June runs with visitors between N√ºrnberg Hauptbahnhof and F√ºrth Hauptbahnhof were made.

It is to be found as a display model in the Nuremberg Transport Museum.Peter Heigl: Adler ‚Äì Stationen einer Lokomotive im Laufe dreier Jahrhunderte. Buch & Kunstverlag Oberpfalz, Amberg 2009, , p. 73. = Further replicas and pictures = Since 1964 a 1:2 scale, motorised replica, the \\"Mini-Adler\\", had run at Nuremberg Zoo. It started in the vicinity of the entrance and shuttled to the children's zoo. In the course of the dolphin lagoon project this line had to be closed, but an extension or move of the route is planned. The G√∂rlitzer Oldtimer Parkeisenbahn uses a replica on a narrow gauge railway with a track gauge of . This replica is in fact a diesel locomotive. As part of the town's millennium celebrations \\"1000 years in F√ºrth\\" a bus was decorated with the Adler, and advertised an exhibition, at which donations for the reconstruction were collected. In the stamp-volumes of the Reichspost from 1935, the Deutsche Bundespost from 1960, the Deutsche Post of the GDR from 1960 and the Deutsche Bundespost from 1985 the Adler was appreciated to the jubilees of \\"100\\", \\"125\\", and \\"150\\" years of German railways. At the 175th anniversary in 2010 a 55 eurocent commemorative stamp with a picture of the Adler was issued by the Deutsche Post AG.

A. Turner as Jim Joyce * Tammany Young as McGee's Henchman Plot The film begins with a short prologue explaining the science of Eugenics; contrasting the careful selection observed in the animal world with the less predictable breeding habits of humans. This is illustrated by the story of the Joyce family, headed by Jim Joyce (Turner), a cruel and senseless man. Joyce's son Larry (Harron) is by nature a sensitive kid, but Jim Joyce turns him into a heartless monster, strangling a cat as a sort of coming of age ritual. Larry Joyce contracts a case of syphilis, and seeks out treatment from Doctor Von Eiden (Moore), who also takes a keen interest in Larry's sister May (Sweet). Von Eiden encourages May to make a break with her family, and she succeeds. However she is unable to find employment and enters into a relationship with a wealthy senator (Lewis) as a kept woman. While May will not marry the Senator, her sister Jennie (Marsh) does marry a man named \\"Bull\\" McGee (Crisp), an abusive lout just like her father. Their infant child is killed when McGee trips over its cradle in a drunken stupor, and Jennie becomes delusional, endlessly rocking the cradle with a doll inside. McGee is repulsed by her condition and puts Jennie away quietly through selling her into prostitution. May manages to wrest Jennie away from this peril, but Jennie expires soon after. Von Eiden, however, has managed to restore Larry's original sensitivity through a surgical procedure; May has broken off the relationship with the Senator and agrees to marry Von Eiden. Historical background and legacy The Escape was based on a play by Paul Armstrong, a prolific playwright best known for his properties Alias Jimmy Valentine (1910) and Salomy Jane (1907). Griffith's film version was begun first, finished second, but released third among the cycle of five films he made at Reliance-Majestic Studios between his ouster at Biograph Company and the advent of The Birth of a Nation (1915). Filming of The Escape began in New York City, but was completed in Los Angeles partly due to an illness in the cast. There was a long delay in getting it out; although Mutual Film finally released it on June 1, 1914, response to The Escape was of a mixed character and the film was dumped on the States' Rights market by the end of the year.The Escape at afi.com Lillian Gish recalled The Escape as one of the finest films Griffith ever made,Lillian Gish with Ann Prentice -- The Movies, Mr. Griffith and Me.

Facts When reaching the age of 65, Mr Palacios was notified of the automatic termination of his contract of employment on the ground that he had reached the compulsory retirement age as provided for in art.19(3) of a collective agreement and that, on July 2, 2005, a national law had been published, a single transitional provision which authorised such a measure. That single transitional provision provided that: > ‚Äúclauses in collective agreements concluded prior to the entry into force of > this Law, which provide for the termination of contracts of employment where > workers have reached normal retirement age, shall be lawful provided it is > ensured that the workers concerned have completed the minimum period of > contributions and satisfy the other requirements laid down in social > security legislation for entitlement to a retirement pension under their > contribution regime‚Äù. Mr Palacios fulfilled the last two conditions. He brought an action before the referring Court, requested that this notification be declared null and void on the ground that it was in breach of his fundamental rights and, more particularly, his right not to be discriminated against on the ground of age, since the measure was based solely on the fact that he had reached the age of 65. The referring Court, inter alia, asked whether the prohibition of any discrimination based on age in employment and occupation must be interpreted as meaning that it precluded national legislation such as that in the main proceedings, pursuant to which compulsory retirement clauses contained in collective agreements were regarded as lawful, where such clauses provided as sole requirements that workers must have reached retirement age, set at 65 years by the national legislation, and must fulfil the other social security conditions for entitlement to draw a contributory retirement pension. Judgment The European Court of Justice decided that national legislation was not prohibited under Directive 2000/78/EC. It did fall under Article 2, because, * Directive 2000/78 was applicable to a situation such as that giving rise to the dispute before the national court. [42-7] * The aim of the Directive was to combat certain types of discrimination, including discrimination on grounds of age, as regards employment and occupation with a view to putting into effect in the Member States the principle of equal treatment. National legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings must be regarded as directly imposing less favourable treatment for workers who had reached that age as compared with all other persons in the labour force. Such legislation therefore established a difference in treatment directly based on age, as referred to in Art.2(1) and (2)(a) of the Directive. [49]-[51] But there was a justification based on Article 6(1) * Article 6(1)(1) of the Directive provided that such inequalities would not constitute discrimination prohibited under Art.2 \\"if, within the context of national law, they were objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim, including legitimate employment policy, labour market and vocational training objectives, and if the means of achieving that aim were appropriate and necessary\\". [52] * The single transitional provision was adopted, at the instigation of the social partners, as part of a national policy seeking to promote better access to employment, by means of better distribution of work between the generations. It was true that that provision did not expressly refer to an objective of that kind. However, that fact alone was not decisive. Placed in its context, the single transitional provision was aimed at regulating the national labour market, in particular, for the purposes of checking unemployment. [53]-[62] * The legitimacy of such an aim of public interest could not reasonably be called into question. In accordance with the first indent of Art.2(1) EU and Art.2 EC, the promotion of a high level of employment was one of the ends pursued both by the European Union and the European Community. Furthermore, encouragement of recruitment undoubtedly constituted a legitimate aim of social policy. That assessment must evidently apply to instruments of national employment policy designed to improve opportunities for entering the labour market for certain categories of workers. [63]-[65].ITC (C-208/05) [2008] 1 C.M.L.R. 15 , followed. * Therefore, an objective such as that referred to by the legislation at issue must, in principle, be regarded as \\"objectively and reasonably\\" justifying \\"within the context of national law\\", as provided for by Art.6(1)(1) of the Directive, a difference in treatment on grounds of age laid down by the Member States. [66] The means of pursuing these legitimate aims were furthermore held \\"appropriate and necessary\\". As Community law stood, the Member States and, where appropriate, the social partners at national level enjoyed broad discretion in their choice, not only to pursue a particular aim in the field of social and employment policy, but also in the definition of measures capable of achieving it. Such was the case as regards the choice which the national authorities concerned might be led to make on the basis of political, economic, social, demographic and/or budgetary considerations and having regard to the actual situation in the labour market in a particular Member State, to prolong people's working life or, conversely, to provide for early retirement.

They related to Right to property under Article 1 of the First Protocol and Prohibition of Discrimination under Article 14 of the Convention. In Reynolds's case there was also Article 8 of the ECHR, the right to respect for \\"private and family life\\" to consider as well as Article 3 of ECHR, the prohibition of torture, and \\"inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\\".  Background  Annette Carson was a UK pensioner who had relocated to work in South Africa in 1989. In April 2002, she brought this case under the Human Rights Act 1998. Carson contended that the failure of the UK Government to pay to pensioners resident in certain countries abroad the inflation uprating of their UK State pensions, while paying the annual uprating in other countries, contravened the UK Human Rights Act of 1998 (based on the European Convention on Human Rights)) on grounds of discrimination. Annual uprating to the UK State Pension is payable in countries like the UK, the (EEA) and a number of disparate countries (the United States, for example), whilst not being payable in predominantly Commonwealth countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. Joanne Reynolds was under 25 and living in a council flat in England. She was receiving the Jobseekers Allowance and Income Support. She received less that she would have received if she had been over 25. This allegedly breached: #Article 1 of the First Protocol of the ECHR; #Article 14, taken in conjunction with Article 1 of the First Protocol of the ECHR; #Article 8 of the ECHR; #Article 3 of ECHR. The two Claimants - Carson and Reynolds - had separate Administrative Court hearings in 2002 but their Appeal hearing in 2003 to the Supreme Court of Judicature Court of Appeal (Civil Division) and to the House of Lords in 2005 were consolidated since the UK courts decided that the points of law raised in the Administrative courts were similar. The Carson Case was pursued as a class action in the ECHR in 2008, where she was joined by 12 other Applicants who, because they were resident in Australia and Canada, were in a similar position to her. Reynolds was not involved in this class action.  Chronology and Judgments R(Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] EWHC 978 (Admin) = Royal-courts-of-justice This case was heard in the Administration Court of the Queen's Bench Division in the High Court of Justice before the Honourable Mr. Justice Burnton. Justice Burnton said that he understood how: \\"Very many of the expatriate UK pensioners who do not receive uprated pensions have a strong and understandable sense of grievance......They feel that they have been deprived of an increasingly substantial part of the fruit of their contribtions......as a result, they have formed associations to press their cause for equal treatment\\" para 6 The response from the Secretary of State for the DWP was that successive Governments have taken the view that increases in the UK State Pension were based on economic factors within the UK, and it would be unfair on UK tax payers to incur additional taxes to support those residents that have chosen to live abroad. para 34 The United Kingdom is the only OECD country that discriminates between pensioners living in different overseas countries. para 36. Justice Burnton also stated that: \\"...a government may lawfully decide to restrict the payment of benefits of any kind to those who are within its territorial jurisdiction, leaving the care and support of those who live elsewhere to the governments of the countries in which they live. Such a restriction may be based wholly or partly on considerations of cost, but having regard to the wide margin of discretion that must be accorded to the government, I do not think it one that a court may say is unreasonable or lacking in objective justification\\". para 73. Justice Burnton concluded that the decision as to whether expatriate UK pensioners received state pension benefits (including any annual increases) was a political decision, rather than a judicial one and he therefore dismissed the case, but he gave leave to appeal. paras 76 & 77 Costs were awarded against Carson. Cited as: [2002] EWHC 978 (Admin), [2002] 3 All ER 994 =Reynolds, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] EWHC 426 (Admin) = This case was heard in the Administration Court of the Queen's Bench Division in the High Court of Justice before the Honourable Mr. Justice Wilson. Reynolds contended that under the 1998 Human Rights Act and the European Convention of Human Rights her Article 1 of the First Protocol, Article 14, taken in conjunction with Article 1 of the First Protocol, Article 8 of ECHR and Article 3 of the ECHR rights had been breached. Judge Wilson decided that entitlement of Income Support is not a \\"possession\\" within Article 1 and that the demarcation line drawn by the Government i.e. between the ages of 24 and 25 were made clear by Parliament in 1987. These were extended in 1996. He concluded that it was an issue of social policy, and that the Government had demonstrated that there was \\"reasonable foundation\\" for the demarcation. It was also his opinion that: \\"Article 3 describes ill treatment of a depth which the level of payment to Reynolds wholly fails to reach\\". However, Reynolds contended that the demarcation between the age of 24 and 25 in terms of receiving state benefits was irrational. Judge Wilson disagreed, and dismissed Reynolds application. Justice Wilson found in favour of the Secretary of State, but gave Reynolds leave to appeal. Cited as: [2002] EWHC 426 (Admin). =Carson & Anor v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions - Carson & Reynolds [2003] EWCA Civ 797 = Two High Court cases which had been heard independently were brought together for the purposes of this appeal before the Supreme Court of Judicature Court of Appeal (Civil Division) before Lord Justice Simon Brown, Lord Justice Laws, and Lord Justice Rix which was heard on 17 June 2003: :1. R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions from the Administration Court of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice] in England and Wales before Justice Burnton; :2. Reynolds, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] EWHC 426 (Admin) (7th March, 2002) from the Administration Court of the Queens Bench Division of the High Court of Justice]in England and Wales before Mr. Justice Wilson. Lord Justice Laws conceded that the current situation was \\"haphazard\\", quoting the UK Minister of State Jeff Rooker who, on 13 November 2000, said: :\\"I have already said I am not prepared to defend the logic of the present situation. It is illogical. There is no consistent pattern. It does not matter whether it is in the Commonwealth or outside it. We have arrangements with some Commonwealth countries and not with others. Indeed, there are differences among Caribbean countries. This is an historical issue and the situation has existed for years\\". para 54 The UK Government's position has always been that successive UK Governments have taken the view that and increases to the UK state pension are based on economic conditions in the UK and that it would be unfair on UK taxpayers to pay a higher level of taxes in order to pay pension increases to people who have chosen to become resident elsewhere in the world. Motions to pay the annual increases to those UK pensioners living abroad who do not currently receive these increases have been submitted to both Houses of Parliament in June and July 1995 during the passage of the Pensions Bill, which called for uprating to be paid. All were defeated with significant majorities\\". para 52 The UK only uprates the State Pension where there is a legal liability to do so - this includes all UK pensioners living in the UK, the EEA, and a number of other countries where there are bilateral agreements in place relating to the UK State Pension. Whilst bilateral agreements were agreed with Australia (1953), New Zealand (1956) and Canada (1959), they did not include the uprating of the UK State Pension. Australia cancelled its bilateral agreement with the UK in 2001 because the UK Government would not uprate the State Pension for those UK pensioners who had emigrated to Australia. This was not an issue when the UK joined the EEC since bilateral agreements were in place for all of the EEC countries except Denmark. These bilateral agreements did facilitate the uprating of the UK State Pension. para 53 In rejecting Reynolds's case, Lord Justice Laws said: \\"in my view, the Secretary of State has demonstrated a perfectly reasonable justification for the differential payments of Job Seekers Allowance.\\" The three Law Justices dismissed both appeals - however, leave was given to Carson and Reynolds to appeal to the House of Lords. Cited as: [2003] 3 All ER 577, [2003] HRLR 36, [2003] EWCA Civ 797 =Carson, R v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions - House of Lords - Carson & Reynolds [2005] UKHL 37 = Lord Hoffman, one of the Appellate Committee Lords of Appeal The Carson/Reynolds appeal was heard by the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords on appeal from the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) before the Appellate Committee made up of: Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, Lord Carswell. Carson argued that she was being unfairly treated. She says she had paid the same National Insurance Contributions (NICs) as a United Kingdom resident and therefore she should receive the same pension. She is supported by associations of expatriate pensioners in South Africa and elsewhere. Lord Hoffman said: \\"Carson's case is typical of over 400,000 United Kingdom pensioners living abroad in countries which do not have reciprocal treaty arrangements under which cost of living increases are payable. Arrangements exist for countries within EEA countries (European Union countries, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and a number of other countries such as the United States (\\"treaty countries\\"). However, there are no such treaties with South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and many other countries\\". para 6. The House of Lords accepted the Secretary of State's arguments with regards to Reynolds. Lord Walker and Lord Nichols referred to case law saying they would intensely scrutinise race, sex and orientation justifications. But age was not in that. It is \\"a personal characteristic,\\" said Lord Walker, \\"but it is different in kind from other personal characteristics. Every human being starts life as a tiny infant and none of us can do anything to stop the passage of the years. Lines must be drawn somewhere, and \\"drawing lines which create distinctions is peculiarly a legislative task and an unavoidable one. Perfection in making the necessary classifications is neither possible nor necessary\\". The key issue was whether the Secretary of State had the right to deal with Job Seekers who were under 25 in a different way to those who were over the age of 25. paras 36 & 37 It was also noted that the age qualification had replaced a previous unworkable qualification of householders and non-householders. Lord Carswell agreed with the other judges in rejecting Reynolds's appeal but allowed Carson's appeal and declared that regulation 3 of the Social Security Benefits Up-rating Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/910) was unlawful. para 104 In addition, he cited a number of other for allowing Carson's appeal. paras: 96-104 The judgment of the Law Lords was 4 to 1 in favour of the Secretary of State. Cited as: [2005] 2 WLR 1369, [2006] AC 173, 18 BHRC 677, [2006] 1 AC 173, [2005] UKHL 37, [2005] UKHRR 1185, [2005] HRLR 23, [2005] 4 All ER 545 =Carson and Others v. The United Kingdom (Application No. 42184/05) ‚Äì Fourth Section= European Court of Human Rights Courtroom Carson was joined by 12 other Applicants from Australia and Canada who were in the same position as she was, and they had formed a class action to appeal the UK House of Lords judgment. The case was considered in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), Fourth Section (Lower Chamber) in Strasbourg, France on appeal from the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords in a hearing before Lech Garlicki (President); Nicolas Bratza; Giovanni Bonello; Ljiljana Mijoviƒá; David Th√≥r Bj√∂rgvinsson; Ledi Bianku; Mihai Poalelungi on 4 November 2008. The applicants argued that the entitlement to a basic state pension was a \\"possession\\" within Article 1 of Protocol 1, and the Government were depriving them of part of that \\"possession\\" i.e. the annual uprating. They were being denied this uprating because they resided in mainly Commonwealth countries that the UK Government claimed did not have reciprocal agreements with the UK and these were termed \\"frozen countries\\". All of these applicants had been adversely affected financially as they were not receiving the annual uprating to their UK state pension that was intended to help counteract inflation. As a result, their UK state pension was being eroded and it had less buying power year on year. para 59 In addition, the applicants claimed that Article 14 also applied in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol 1. They believed that previous interpretations of case law had been too narrow and superseded by more recent case law. Whilst the UK Government had maintained that moving abroad was a freedom of choice, for many, this was the only way they could be near their family. They felt that they were being unfairly discriminated against. This discrimination, based on grounds of where a person chooses to reside is central to the enjoyment of certain human rights such as the right to family life, freedom of movement, and human dignity. This is likely to have a greater impact on women since, statistically, they will live longer. Given this, the court is right to scrutinise the UK Government. para 60 Age Concern were a \\"third party\\" in this case and they had carried out a number of focus groups that identified that receiving the annual increase to the UK state pension was important to retirees. In carrying out surveys of older Chinese immigrants one of the main reasons why they had not returned to their home of birth was because they would no longer receive the annual increase to their UK state pension. In addition, in terms of the \\"most desirable\\" countries for emigration, five out of the top 10 are \\"frozen\\" countries (Australia, Canada, China, New Zealand and South Africa), and therefore, it is highly likely that a large proportion of the older population had families residing in countries where the UK state pension was not uprated. para 64 :\\"Pensioners become more frail as they get older - it is important that they have a support and welfare infrastructure around them, and in many cases this will be family\\". Where families live abroad, then at some stage their parents are more likely join them and the Institute for Public Policy Research has produced a report that showed that 20% of older people had emigrated to be with family or for personal reasons i.e. not work related. para 63 The UK Government argued that because the applicants were from outside the UK, it was fair and reasonable to treat them differently. Social Security benefits, of which the State Pension was one, were meant for residents of the UK such that they could enjoy certain minimum standards. Systems that existed in other countries were also tailored to individuals living in those countries. para 56 In Carson's House of Lord's Appeal, Lord Hoffmann stated that those in need were \\" generally recognised to be national in character ... it does not extend to inhabitants of foreign countries‚Äù, and that this was enshrined in UK domestic legislation. The Government agreed with Lord Hoffmann that it could not be the law that the United Kingdom was prohibited from treating expatriate pensioners generously unless it treated them in exactly the same way as pensioners at home. para 57 The applicants contended that discrimination only occurs if similar situations are treated differently and that there is no difference between the three cohorts of pensioners (those residing in the UK, those living abroad in \\"frozen countries\\" and those living abroad where the uprating is paid)- they all share one common characteristic, and that is they spent the same time in the UK and paid the same social security contributions into the National Insurance Fund. In addition, the applicants contended, the need for a reasonable standard of living is the same for all three groups of pensioners. All of the UK domestic courts (other than Lord Carswell in the House of Lords appeal) agreed that the three groups of pensioners do not have to be treated the same when it came to uprating the UK state pension. para 77 The UK state pension is designed to provide a \\"minimum standard of living for those living in the UK\\", and the Court found that the three groups of pensioners were not in relevantly analogous positions and therefore the UK Government had the right to treat them differently. As far back as 1983, there was case law regarding a British Pensioner who had emigrated to Australia who was denied an uprated pension. In addition, in Carson's House of Lords appeal, the Government could have made the decision to not pay any UK state pension to \\"frozen\\" pensioners at all. para 78 When looking at all UK pensioners living overseas, the Court could not find similarity between those pensioners who were resident in \\"frozen\\" countries and those resident in \\"unfrozen\\" countries. Social security contributions are used for other purposes besides paying the state pension - the National Health Service, for example. Even in those cases where there is proximity between \\"frozen\\" and \\"unfrozen\\" countries - Canada and the United State, for example, there is still differences in their social security provision, taxation, rates of inflation, interest and currency exchange rates to make it difficult to compare them. para 79 The Court considers that these differences are \\"objective and reasonable\\" such that the UK Government can treat them differently, even though Age Concern in England made some powerful arguments as to why pensioners emigrate in the first place - ultimately, it is down to a matter of \\"personal choice\\". In addition, the UK Government claimed that it had made people aware that if they moved abroad, they may be moving to a \\"frozen\\" country where their UK state pension would not be uprated. para 80 The Court decided that the Government can decide which countries it wants to have reciprocal social security agreements with and which ones it doesn't, based on its own economic policies, therefore, in the Court's opinion, the Government has not violated Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. para 81 & 82 The court therefore decided by six votes to 1 that there had been no violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No 1. The dissenting opinion came from the President of the Court, Lech Garlicki. He thought that the difference in treatment of different cohorts of pensioners had no objective and reasonable justification.

The United Kingdom (Application No. 42184/05) ‚Äì Grand Chamber= Annette Carson and other applicants and their legal team prior to first hearing before the ECHR Grand Chamber - 2 September 2009 Carson and the 12 other Applicants appealed the decision from the ECHR Fourth Section. The case was heard publicly in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), Grand Chamber in Strasbourg, France on 2 September 2009 and 27 January 2010, with judgment handed down on 16 March 2010.

The applicants argued that their following human rights had been violated: para 52 :1. Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 \\\\- \\"Right to property\\" on its own and in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention :2. Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights in conjunction with Article 14 (six applicants) The applicants argued that they were being discriminated against because they were not receiving the annual increase to their UK state pension whilst others in a similar position to them were. The Court maintained that, under UK domestic law an under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the applicants do not have a right to receive the annual uprating. This had been dismissed by the ECHR Fourth Section and cannot be appealed. para 57 The Court did not accept the UK Government's objections to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for the 12 applicants that had not filed domestic proceedings in the UK, and given that Carson had already brought test cases which had failed in the UK domestic courts, there was no point in the applicants litigating in the UK. para 58 The applicants maintained that the treating of \\"residence\\" was an aspect of \\"personal status\\" and was consistent with case law. In addition, their position is that whilst moving abroad is a question of \\"free choice\\" it is not so if it is driven by the need or desire to be close to family members. para 67 The Government had conceded in the UK domestic courts that Carson's \\"foreign residence\\" was protected under Article 14, but argued that moving abroad was a matter of choice. para 68 The third parties, Age Concern and Help the Aged, emphasised the importance of family support in old age. para 69 The Government argued that National Insurance Contributions paid into the National Insurance Fund cannot be equated to contributions to an occupational or private pension schemes. With regard to the UK state pension, there are no guaranteed entitlements. para 81 The Court agreed unanimously that the complaint under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 8 inadmissible; The rejected unanimously the UK Government's preliminary objection concerning the admissibility of the complaints of the applicants, other than Carson herself; they agreed by eleven votes to six that there had been no violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The six dissenting judges published their joint opinion setting out their reasons for dissent: Joint dissenting opinion The UK Government prevailed; Carson and the other Applicants lost their appeal and they had run out of Courts to appeal to.

It debuted in November 2002 with the first issue having a January 2003 cover date. Based on Shueisha's popular Japanese magazine Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump, Shonen Jump is retooled for English readers and the American audience, including changing it from a weekly publication to a monthly one. It features serialized chapters from four manga series, and articles on Japanese language and culture, as well as manga, anime, video games, and figurines. Prior to the magazine's launch, Viz launched an extensive marketing campaign to promote it and help it succeed where previous manga anthologies published in North America had failed. Shueisha purchased an equity interest in Viz to help fund the venture, and Cartoon Network, Suncoast, and Diamond Distributors became promotional partners in the magazine. In conjunction with the magazine, Viz launched new imprints for releasing media related to the series presented in the magazine, and other sh≈çnen works. This includes two new manga imprints, an anime DVD imprint, a fiction line for releasing light novels, a label for fan and data books, and a label for the release of art books. Targeted towards young adult males, the first issue required three printings to meet consumer demand, with over 300,000 copies sold. It was awarded the ICv2 \\"Comic Product of the Year\\" award in December 2002, and continued to enjoy high sales with a monthly circulation of 215,000 in 2008. Approximately half of its circulation comes from subscriptions rather than store sales. After the end of its physical circulation, sealed polybagged issues of Shonen Jump are now considered highly sought after among fans and comic book collectors. Shonen Jump published its final issue in April 2012 when Viz decided to focus on a weekly digital manga anthology. Weekly Shonen Jump (initially named Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha) launched in January 2012. Based on Shueisha's popular Japanese magazine Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump, Weekly Shonen Jump is an attempt to provide English readers with easily accessible, affordable, and officially licensed editions of the latest installments of popular Sh≈çnen Jump manga soon after their release in Japan, as an alternative to popular bootleg scanlation services. Viz Media published its final digital issue of Weekly Shonen Jump and launched the Shonen Jump digital vault on December 10, 2018, providing access to a limited number of free digital chapters and a subscription service to access their back catalogue of Shonen Jump titles. A global version of Shonen Jump+ was also launched on January 28, 2019 called Manga Plus by Shueisha. History In June 2002, Viz Media (at the time called \\"Viz Communications\\"), and Shueisha announced that Viz would begin publishing Shonen Jump, an English spin on Shueisha's highly popular manga anthology Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump. Cartoon Network, Suncoast, and Diamond Distributors signed on as promotional partners. Though based on Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump, Viz noted that it would not be a \\"word for word\\" copy. Rather, Viz would select series for its magazine that it felt were the most appropriate for its American readers. Viz's version was also set to be monthly, rather than having weekly, to better fit the American comic distribution system. Jason Thompson, one of Viz's manga editors for series including Dragon Ball was selected as the magazine's first editor-in-chief. Initially, Viz hoped to have the magazine targeted to all age groups, however to allow for greater freedom on content, the decision was made to mark the magazine as being for readers 13 years of age and older. However, with greater attention being focused on manga as it became available in mainstream outlets, some titles were edited for content. Thompson noted that it was a challenge working with some of the artists whose works would appear in the first issue, who worried about excessive alterations. With manga anthologies having met with little success in North America, Viz desired Shonen Jump to have a circulation of 1 million within its first three years. To aid in this goal, Viz launched the magazine with a multimillion-dollar advertising budget, they advertised and distributed the title through mass market outlets rather than just pop culture stores, ensuring the magazine included series already popular with the North American audience due to their airing on Cartoon Network. To help fund the lengthy, expensive marketing campaign developed around Shonen Jump, Shueisha purchased an equity interest in Viz in August 2002. Unlike with most magazine launches, Viz decided to allow retailers to return the first two issues. This gave retailers a chance to see how well the magazine would sell in markets where manga anthologies were an unknown. Retailers were also given a quantity of free samples, distributed 100,000 free samples at Comic Con, and another 100,000 were made available to its partner Suncoast. Cartoon Network began providing sample chapters and streaming video content to its Adult Swim website, along with prominent links to Shonen Jump's official site. The first issue was released November 26, 2002, with a January 2003 cover date. It premiered with five series: Dragon Ball Z, Sand Land, Yu-Gi-Oh!, YuYu Hakusho, and One Piece. With the launch of the magazine considered successful, Thompson was offered an opportunity to intern in Japan with Shueisha's editors, but declined, due to a lack of interest in the management aspects of the business and a desire to work on his own projects. After six issues had been released, Thompson desired to work on authoring and illustrating his own comic The Stiff. Reflecting back later, he states in an interview with The Comics Journal that \\"I basically told Viz that I wanted to work part time or I'd quit. It probably wasn't a really nice thing to do.\\" He eventually stepped down as editor-in-chief, being replaced by his former boss Yumi Hoashi. In February 2005, Viz announced the creation of Shojo Beat, a sister publication of Shonen Jump geared towards female readers. The first issue was released in June 2005 with a July 2005 date cover; it ran for 47 issues until it was discontinued with the release of the July 2009 issue. In 2006, Marc Weidenbaum was named as the Editor-in-Chief for both magazines. Weidenbaum remained the magazine's editor until February 13, 2009, when Viz announced that he had left the company; the magazine's new editor-in-chief has not been named. As of the June 2011 issue, only 10 issues were published in a year. The magazine is printed at Transcontintental Printing RBW Graphics in Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada. In October 2011, Viz announced that Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha, a weekly digital version of the magazine would be made available to the public beginning on January 30, 2012. Viz also released its final Shonen Jump print publication in March of that year after Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha was released. Features The bulk of each issue of Shonen Jump is composed of chapters from the seven manga titles currently in serialization. Each issue also includes product reviews for anime and manga related games and toys, articles on Japanese language and culture, interviews with manga artists, anime and manga related news, fan related sections such as fan art and letters from readers, and interactive games and trivia sections. Issues also regularly include free premiums, such as rare cards for manga and anime collectible card game adaptations, DVD previews, and video game demo discs. The magazine's official website includes information on all series released under the \\"Shonen Jump\\" label, biographies of the manga artists whose works have been serialized in the magazine, and previews of upcoming issues. Subscribers to the magazine have access to an additional area of the site where they can view preview chapters of manga series in the magazine and being published under the various \\"Shonen Jump\\" imprints, download desktop wallpapers, send e-cards, and play games. As with Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump, special edition stand alone issues of Shonen Jump are released several times a year that focus on a manga series. These issues, which are considered collector's items, include extensive details on the series plot and characters, information on related adaptations of the series, and free premium items, such as full-size posters. Anniversary editions are released yearly, usually featuring higher page counts, color manga pages, and higher end premiums. To celebrate the fifth anniversary of the magazine, Viz also introduced hardback \\"Collector Editions\\" of some of the magazine's most popular series as a part of their main \\"Shonen Jump\\" manga imprint. The new editions were larger sized, with color dust jackets and higher quality paper than the normal volumes. They also included several full- color pages not seen in the initial releases. Viz also released Shonen Jump Fifth Anniversary Collector's Edition, a hardcover book containing chapters from its best selling series, along with various articles and interviews that appeared in the magazine during its first five-year history, a timeline tracking the history of manga, and essays written by editors from Shonen Jump and Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump. =Series= The premiere issue of Shonen Jump contained chapters from five different manga series, before it was expanded to include chapters from seven series. Fourteen series were featured in the magazine, with seven having ended their runs to be replaced with other series. Only four of those remained in the magazine until all of their chapters had been published. Each title serialized in the magazine is also published in tank≈çbon volumes under the company's related \\"Shonen Jump\\" and \\"Shonen Jump Advanced\\" labels. This is a complete list of all titles to be serialized in Shonen Jump. It does not include previews of titles. The titles that were running in the magazine when it was discontinued are highlighted. =Imprints= In conjunction with the Shonen Jump anthology, Viz Media has created multiple new imprints in its various divisions. \\"Shonen Jump\\" is the primary manga imprint for releasing the tank≈çbon volumes of the series that have appeared in the magazine, as well as other similar sh≈çnen titles that were serialized in other Jump magazines in Japan. A second manga imprint, \\"Shonen Jump Advanced\\", was launched in April 2005 to target older teenage and young adult readers with more \\"mature themes.\\" In October 2005, Viz expanded the \\"Shonen Jump\\" imprint into their home video releases. \\"Shonen Jump Home Video\\" offers anime series and original video animations adapted from manga series appearing in Shonen Jump. In 2006, the \\"SJ Fiction\\" imprint, part of the Viz Fiction line, was announced. The imprint is used for light novel releases related to manga series appearing in Shonen Jump. \\"SJ Profiles\\" prints fan books, data books, and other similar works for the Shonen Jump series, while art books are released under the \\"Art of SJ\\" imprint. Circulation and audience The initial issue of Shonen Jump sold over 300,000 copies, far exceeding Viz's expected 100,000 copies and making it one of the top comic titles in 2002. The first printing of 250,000 copies was sold out before the issue was released, and two additional printings were necessary to fully meet the demand. After the initial launch, the magazine had an average monthly circulation of 190,000, but it quickly grew to 305,000 by its first anniversary. The August 2003 issue, which included a demo version of an upcoming Yu-Gi-Oh! PC game, was the top issue with 540,000 copies sold. As of 2008, the magazine had a circulation of 215,000, with subscriptions constituting 54% of the copies distributed. Though targeted towards \\"tween & teen male consumers\\", according to Viz Media the magazine enjoys a relatively high number of female and adult readers as well, comprising 36% and 37% of its readership, respectively. The Shonen Jump reader has a median age of 16 years, and over half of the audience is between the ages of 13 and 17. Official measurements by Simmons notes that among minor age readers the female readership is slightly lower and the median age is 12. Reception Shonen Jump is considered the \\"most successful and widely read\\" manga anthology in North America. In addition to the unparalleled circulation numbers, the \\"Shonen Jump\\" manga imprint has had consistently high sales, with many of its titles being top sellers. Naruto has been the line's top seller, accounting for nearly 10% of all manga sales in North America in 2006. In December 2002, the magazine received the ICv2 Award for \\"Comic Product of the Year\\" due to its unprecedented sales numbers and its successfully connecting comics to both the television medium and the Yu-Gi-Oh! collectible card game ‚Äì one of the top CCG games of the year. In the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Awards from 2009, Shonen Jump was the winner in the category \\"Best Publication\\". Reviewers of the magazine applauded the selection of series and the various articles included in each issue. In his coverage of the magazine's debut issue, John Jakala of Anime News Network, compared it to the debut issue of competing work Raijin Comics and was surprised to find himself preferring Shonen Jump, despite it being targeted for a younger age group than Raijin Comics. Calling it an \\"impressive debut issue\\", Jakala predicted that its high quality content and high value for the price would result in the anthology becoming a successful anthology in North America. In succeeding reviews, Jakala stated that Shonen Jump put \\"American comics to shame\\", particularly in terms of the size of the magazine for the price versus the normal size of a similarly priced issue of a regular comic book. He did, however, note that the episodic nature of some of the series included had started to become repetitive after three issues, and that while the articles might appeal to many readers, he himself skipped over them. In addition to praising the value for the dollar, Comic Book Bin's Leroy Douresseaux felt that each of the chapters included were \\"a self-sustaining and satisfying tale with a beginning, middle, and end\\" that, coupled with the character and story summaries included for each series, made it easy for readers to keep up with a series even if they missed an issue.

Originally, it was intended to be used both in the anti-aircraft and tank destroyer roles, but it proved to be ineffective against Soviet tanks like the KV-1 tank. Therefore, it was primarily utilized against lightly armored vehicles and for air defense.  Design  The 40M Nimr√≥d was as previously mentioned a license built variant of the Landsverk L-62 Anti I SPAAG. The L-62 Anti I was based on the chassis of the Landsverk L-60 tank which was already produced under license in Hungary as the 38M Toldi. The L-62 did differ though from the original L-60 chassis. It was longer and wider and had one more roadwheel per side. Besides that the 40M Nimr√≥d differed on its own from the original L-62 Anti I design. While the chassis was basically the same as the L-62 Anti I, although utilizing parts from the 38M Toldi, the turret was modified to house one more crew member from the original 5 of the L-62 Anti I. The crew of the 40M Nimr√≥d consisted of six men: commander, driver, two loaders and two gunners. The vehicle's armament consisted of a single 40 mm 36M anti-aircraft gun, a Hungarian license built 40 mm Bofors L/60 with a rate of fire of 120 rounds per minute. The gun fired the usual ammunition of the 40 mm Bofors: proximity-fuze, impact-fuze and armour-piercing as well as a Hungarian dedicated anti-tank round. It had a penetration of 46 mm at 100 m and 30 mm at 1000 m. The Nimrod carried 640 rounds split into 4 stowages of 160 rounds each. Late in the war, the vehicle was issued with the 42M \\"Kerngranate\\" round. This was a rocket grenade fitted over the muzzle in the fashion of a rifle grenade.  Service history  The 40M Nimr√≥d was manufactured by the Manfred Weiss Works. A first batch of 46 vehicles powered by a German B√ºssing-NAG L8V/36TR engine was followed by another batch of 89 vehicles powered by a Hungarian Ganz IP VGT 107 Type II (built under license from B√ºssing-NAG). Although it was originally intended for anti-tank use, in 1943 the 40M Nimr√≥d was reclassified for anti-aircraft use; as it was unable to penetrate the armor of the tanks in use by the Red Army. The following units have employed this vehicle: * 51st Heavy Armor Battalion, 1st Hungarian Armored Division * 52nd Heavy Armor Battalion, 2nd Hungarian Armored Division * 1st Hungarian Cavalry Division A total of 135 Nimrods were built, most of which were deployed by the 51st and 52nd Armoured Autocannon Battalions of the 1st and 2nd Hungarian Armoured Divisions, respectively. Nimrod batteries attached to armoured and motorized battalions were allocated six vehicles each. A platoon consisted of two vehicles.  Gallery  M√°ty√°sf√∂ld, √öjsz√°sz utca 41-43.

He alleged discrimination under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, saying that a comparator ought to be a homosexual woman, and that he was therefore less favourably treated on grounds of his sex. Both the tribunal and the EAT found against him, because they held it was sexuality discrimination, not gender discrimination that he suffered. Judgment Ward LJ held that the tribunals had failed to ask themselves whether a homosexual woman would not have been less favourably treated. That was the correct question, which they would have to try to do again. The suggestion was, that Barbara would not have been malicious and violent towards a gay woman, and therefore there probably was discrimination.

The effective diagnosis of organizational culture, and structural and operational strengths and weaknesses are fundamental to any successful organizational development intervention. As BeckhardOrganizational Development: strategies and models - Beckhard 1969 said in the preface to his seminal work: > ... in our rapidly changing environment, new organization forms must be > developed; more effective goal-setting and planning processes must be > learned, and practiced teams of independent people must spend real time > improving their methods of working, decision-making and communicating. > Competing or conflicting groups must move towards a collaborative way of > work. In order for these changes to occur and be maintained, a planned, > managed change effort is necessary - a program of organizational > development. This was written in 1969 and while much has been learnt it is just as true today. Since the beginnings of organizational development as a profession, diagnosis has moved from the purely behavioral towards a strategic and holistic business diagnostic approach, and from looking at human interventions in isolation to exploring the interactions of people in the context in which they operate. As organizations are more collaborative in nature, the traditional silo approach to diagnostics is becoming increasingly rare. Organizational development and in particular the diagnostic phase of activities is spreading from the occupational psychologists towards mainstream business. This is important for OD practitioners as the role is increasingly holistic. The organizational diagnosis models The following models have been introduced for organizational diagnosis: # Force Field Analysis (1951) # Leavitt‚Äôs model (1965) # Likert system analysis (1967) # Weisbord‚Äôs six-box model; (1976) defined by focusing on one major output, exploring the extent to which consumers of the output are satisfied with it, and tracing the reasons for any dissatisfaction. # Congruence model for organization analysis (1977) # Mckinsey 7s framework (1981-1982) # Tichy‚Äôs technical political cultural (TPC) framework (1983) # High-performance programming (1984) # Diagnosing individual and group behavior (1987) # Burke‚ÄìLitwin model of organizational performance and change (1992) All models are based on open system (Open System Theory, OST): From the General System Theory defined by Von Bertalaffy (a system complex of interacting elements), Katz and Kahn (1978) apply the concept of Open System Theory (OST), looking at the relationship between the organizations and the environment in which they are involved. This focus reflects on the organization's ability to adapt to changes in environment conditions (with or without the need for information processing). (Boulding, 1956; Katz and Kahn, 1978) # Falletta‚Äôs organizational intelligence model (2008) # Semantic Network Analysis (2014) (by Zarei, Chaghouee and Ghapanchi) The consulting process The organizational diagnostic phase is often integrated within an overall OD process, commonly called 'a consulting process'. An example of such a process is: Entry ‚Üí Diagnosis ‚Üí Action Planning ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí TerminationManagement Consulting - Kubr As the second phase in the consulting cycle, it is also the first fully operational phase of the consulting process or cycle. The purpose of the diagnosis is to examine the problem faced by the organization in detail, to identify factors and forces that are causing the problem and to prepare the collected information to decide how to implement possible solutions to the identified problems. The diagnosis of the problem is a separate phase from the solutions themselves.

Facts Ms Stedman, a Christian, had worked at an employment agency since 1990. From December 1991 the applicant, along with other staff, was required to work on Sundays. In the period from December 1991 to May 1992 she worked on 10 out of a total of 25 Sundays. On 27 April 1992 Ms. Stedman gave the manager one month's notice that she was no longer prepared to work on Sunday. On 7 May 1992 she was told that her contract of employment was to be amended to include Sunday as a normal working day, on a rota basis, with no enhanced rate of pay. The applicant refused to sign the new contract and said that she would continue working under her existing contract. On 4 June 1992 she was dismissed after 22 months of employment, and paid one month's pay in lieu of notice. She claimed this was a breach of her right to freedom of religion under Art.9 ECHR. Under Art.1 the MS must secure Convention rights. She also complained of breach of her right to a family life under Art.8, because she was bound to work some Sundays, and her husband did not. Judgment The European Commission of Human Rights (i.e. the case was not admitted to the actual court) stated by a majority that Ms Stedman resigned because she did not want to work. She was not dismissed because of her religion. Even if she had been employed by the state and dismissed in similar circumstances, there would not have even been an interference with her Art 9(1) rights. The application was ‚Äòmanifestly ill founded‚Äô under Art 27(2) ECHR. For Art 8, ‚Äògiven the almost inevitable compromise and balance between work and family commitments, particularly in families where both partners work‚Äô there was no interference, to constitute any violation. Other challenges under Art.14 and Art.6 were similarly dismissed, and the case was inadmissible.

Previous MP  The seat had become vacant when the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Sir Sidney Herbert had died on 22 March 1939. Herbert had held the seat since an unopposed 1932 by-election.  Previous Result  Candidates  The Conservative candidate was Harold Webbe. The Labour candidate in 1935, William Kennedy, had been reselected to contest the next General Election; however, the Labour party decided not to contest the by-election. The Communist party, who had not contested the seat before, chose Dr Billy Carritt. In an attempt to revive the Popular Front strategy, Carritt stood as an Independent Progressive. Campaign Carritt's campaign chairman was Liberal MP, Richard Acland. Both the constituency Liberal and Labour parties actively supported his campaign. Those who came to speak for him in the constituency included Liberal MP Wilfrid Roberts, expelled Labour MPs Sir Stafford Cripps and George Strauss and other public figures such as J.B.

Result  Carritt attracted the highest ever percentage poll of any anti- Conservative candidate in this seat. The performance revived interest nationally in electoral co-operation to defeat National Government candidates at a General Election, expected to take place later in the year.  Aftermath  In the 1945 general election, Carritt stood in Westminster Abbey as a Communist.

Samuelson's plans for the film were ambitious with outdoor scenes filmed at Cheddar Gorge in Cheddar, Somerset, England doubling for Utah in the United States. James Bragington was an employee of Samuelson's company and was cast purely due to his resemblance to Sidney Paget's famous illustrations of Holmes.

It carried out a few assassinations of British officials, after which the Savarkar brothers were convicted and imprisoned. The society was formally disbanded in 1952.  History  Vinayak Savarkar and Ganesh Savarkar started Mitra Mela, a revolutionary secret society in Nasik in 1899. It was one among several such melas (revolutionary societies) functioning in Maharashtra at that time, which believed in the overthrow of British rule through armed rebellion. In 1904, in a meeting attended by 200 members from various towns in Maharashtra, Vinayak Savarkar renamed it Abhinav Bharat, taking after Giuseppe Mazzini's Young Italy. In 1906, Vinayak Savarkar left to London to study law. In the same year, he compiled a volume called Mazzini Charitra, a translation of the Italian revolutionary Mazzini's writings with a 25-page introduction added. The book was published in Maharashtra in June 1907 and the first edition of 2000 copies is said to have sold out within a month. Mazzini's techniques of secret societies and guerilla warfare were fully embraced by Savarkar. He wrote regular newsletters to his compatriots in India as well as carrying out revolutionary propaganda in London.  Activities  Savarkar's revolutionary propaganda led to the assassination of Lt. Col. William Curzon-Wyllie, the political aide-de-camp to the Secretary of State for India, by Madanlal Dhingra on the evening of 1 July 1909, at a meeting of Indian students in the Imperial Institute in London. Dhingra was arrested and later tried and executed. A. M. T. Jackson, the district magistrate of Nasik, was assassinated in India by Anant Laxman Kanhare in 1909 in the historic \\"Nasik Conspiracy Case\\". The investigation into the Jackson assassination revealed the existence of the Abhinav Bharat Society and the role of the Savarkar brothers in leading it. Vinayak Savarkar was found to have dispatched twenty Browning pistols to India, one of which was used in the Jackson assassination. He was charged in the Jackson murder and sentenced to \\"transportation\\" for life. Savarkar was imprisoned in the Cellular Jail in the Andaman Islands in 1910.

Both the Treaty of Amsterdam and the EU Framework Directive on Employment left open the definition of disability, which allowed the Court to adopt its own definition. The judgment has been criticised by academics as potentially being too close to a medical model of disability (although it does not require medical diagnosis of a disability), rather than the social model of disability. Facts Ms Navas, an employee of a catering company, was sick and waiting for an operation. The ECJ decision does not contain any detail about what illness prevented her from working for eight months. After eight months her employers wrote to her purporting to end her employment. In the letter they admitted that the termination was 'unlawful' (Spanish industrial law allows unlawful termination with financial compensation). She claimed that the termination was instead 'void' and sought reinstatement according to anti- discrimination provisions. She made her claim to the Spanish Courts under the disability provisions of Spanish law, which were in turn based on the EU Framework Equality Directive 2000/78/EC. JudgmentDomestic courts= The domestic Spanish labour courts agreed with Ms Navas' employers that illness did not amount to 'disability', which was the subject of the EU directive and that Spanish law allowed Eurest to fire Ms Navas based on their cost benefit analysis (i.e. financial compensation versus continuing to employ her). This interpretation allows employers to discriminate against sick people, as opposed to people with disability. =Advocate General= Advocate General Ad Geelhoed issued an opinion based on a medical model of disability. He also stated that an ‚Äòautonomous and uniform‚Äô Community meaning should be given to \\"disability\\". He said disability is tied to the concept of a permanent limitation on activities, and while acknowledging that disability could arise from sickness, sickness was a separate concept that did not mean disability. He found that sickness by itself is not enough to trigger protection under the Directive. This reasoning was adopted by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). =European Court of Justice= The ECJ started with Article 136 TEC, which states that the Community exists with \\"a view to lasting high employment and the combating of exclusion.\\" It referred to the mention of disability in the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, para 26. Significance In the absence of a definition in the Directive, the ECJ used the medical model of disability, which focuses on a person's impairment. The judgement has also been criticised for failing to refer to the social model of the disability which had been referred to in European Commission documents underpinning the Directive. One reason for the absence of the judges' opinion of the applicability of the social model is that the ECJ does not publish dissenting views of judges on its bench, but instead must issue a collegiate (i.e. joint) judgment. The ECJ found that a worker who is dismissed only on grounds of sickness is not protected by the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of disability. The judgement has been generally regarded as setting the scene for further judgements relating to the definition of disability, as there is no discussion of Ms Navas' illness having been anything more than a 'sickness' (e.g. not a limitation that amounted to 'disability'). The Framework Directive on Employment did not define 'disability', which given the importance of the Directive and the well known laws in other countries (such as the US's Americans with Disabilities Act) was probably intentional. Some academics saw this as an opening for a wider more social definition of disability. However, on the other hand, this lack of definition left the door wide open to a Court exercising its power to narrow, not expand, the definition. The ECJ case leaves uncertainty about what sicknesses would result in disability, such as episodic mental illness, or sicknesses that take time to become full-fledged permanent limitations. The consequences of the case mean that the ECJ has protected employers in their actions against employees who lose capacity due to minor or temporary illnesses, in the case of Spanish law allowing them to make a cost-benefit analysis to pay compensation and rid themselves of an individual. The opposite conclusion in Navas would have meant that employers would have had to backfill the position of Ms Navas until she could return to work. The ECJ's interpretation has limited the definition of disability as well as medicalising it, which stands in contrast to EU policy makers attempts, at some levels, to introduce the social model, which is now entrenched in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The ECJ decision, with its inherent uncertainty, and reliance on the medical approach, may reinforce the medical model in the EU member states, and perhaps other international jurisdictions, like the US. Lisa Waddington, Professor and European Disability Forum Chair in European Disability Law, Maastricht University, has suggested that the decision may have helped countries to insert a clear social model definition into the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as the EU representative withdrew their opposition to an explicit social model definition following the publication of the ECJ decision.,Prof. Lisa Waddington's Powerpoint presentation on the Navas decision NotesReferences * External links *EU rapid press release on the ECJ decision Category:Spanish case law Category:Disability case law Category:European Union labour case law Category:2006 in European Union case law ","title":"Chac√≥n Navas v Eurest Colectividades SA"},{"id":"18060724","text":"Normandie Avenue is one of Los Angeles County's longest north-south streets, with a stretch of about .

John Green, a shipwright opened the first yard at Wapping in 1814, having been admitted as a burgess in October 1812. This yard was probably used only for boatbuilding, and in 1815 he leased a second much larger premises at Tombs' dock and building yard at Dean's Marsh from Waring & Fisher. Building at both yards continued until 1817 when he left Wapping to concentrate the business at Dean's Marsh, likely owning the whole site and drydock by 1821, leading to the dock being renamed Green's Dock. The first vessel identified as built by Green‚Äôs was the schooner Hunter in 1826. =Shipyard= Ships were later built at the head of the drydock and launched through it into the River Frome. The most well known ship built by Green‚Äôs was the Clifton, launched in 1835, a large 579 ton East Indiaman, which sailed under the flag of its builder.

Dickinson is best known as the artillery officer of the small garrison, and the husband of one of the only three non-Mexican survivors to live through the battle, Susanna Dickinson, as well as the father to their infant daughter Angelina, whose life was also spared. He is a member of the Immortal 32 and Old Eighteen. Early life and becoming a soldier Dickinson was born in Tennessee, learning the trade of blacksmithing. He later enlisted in the US Army as a field artilleryman. He and Susannah married when she was just 15, on May 24, 1829, and two years later they moved to the Mexican province of Texas, where they became settlers in the Dewitt Colony. He received a league of land along the San Marcos River, where he started a blacksmith shop, and partnered with George C. Kimble in a hat factory. On December 14, 1834, their only child, Angelina, was born. Following a number of Indian raids on settlements, he joined a band led by fellow settler Bart McClure and took part in hunting down hostile Indians. In the fall of 1835, Dickinson served as one of the defenders during the Battle of Gonzales, which marked the beginning of Texas' war for independence. He was elected as First Lieutenant of Artillery in December 1835.p.630 Hansen, Todd The Alamo Reader: A Study in History 2003 Stackpole Books He then joined a band of volunteers going to defend San Antonio and became an aide to General Edward Burleson during the Siege of Bexar, with a rank of Lieutenant in the Texian Army. A few weeks later, his home where Susannah and Angelina had remained was looted by members of a Texian Militia, prompting her to join him in San Antonio. They set up residence in the Musquiz house, on the southwest corner of Portero Street and the Main Plaza. When Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna and his troops arrived on February 23, 1836, Dickinson moved his family inside the Alamo. Battle of the Alamo By this time, Dickinson held the rank of Captain, and was in command of the Alamo's artillery of twenty-one cannon. Some accounts list him with a rank of Lieutenant at the Alamo, but it is believed he was promoted. The commander, Lieutenant Colonel William Barrett Travis, led a force of between 180 and 250 men. This included Dickinson and others considered to be regular troops, as well as several bands of volunteers, led by frontiersmen James Bowie and Davey Crockett. Historians have established that the Alamo was not lower or higher than those two figures, with most believing the number to have been 182. One of the dispatches sent out by Travis gave the figure of 150 and at least 32 others are known to have arrived after that. Antonio Ruiz, the Mayor of San Antonio at the time, said that after the battle Mexican soldiers had burned 182 bodies of Alamo defenders and that tends to be the accepted strength of it. Santa Anna had under his command between 5,000 and 6,000 Mexican troops. From the time of his arrival, a siege began. A Mexican bombardment continued through the morning of February 25, 1836. At approximately 10am, about 200‚Äì300 Mexican soldiers, mainly cazadores from the Matamoros Battalion, crossed the San Antonio River and took cover in abandoned shacks approximately 90 yards (82 m) to 100 yards (91 m) from the Alamo walls. They were intending to use the huts as cover to erect another artillery battery, although many Texians assumed that they were actually launching an assault on the Alamo. Travis called for volunteers to burn the huts, despite the fact that it was broad daylight and they would be within range of enemy muskets. Charles Despallier, Robert Brown, James Rose and a few others volunteered for the mission. To provide cover, Dickinson and his men fired 8-lb cannon, filled with grapeshot and canister, at the Mexican soldiers in the huts. Crockett and his men fired rifles, while other Texians reloaded extra weapons for them. Within two hours, the battle was over. As soon as the Texians saw flames erupting from the huts they threw open the Alamo gate and the Texians re-entered unscathed, although Rose was almost captured by a Mexican officer. The Mexicans retreated with two killed and four wounded, while several Texians had been mildly scratched by flying rock. After learning that a relief force under James Fannin had failed to reach the Alamo and that there was unlikely to be any further reinforcement, a group of 25 men set out from Gonzales at 2pm on Saturday, February 27. The party would number 32 upon its arrival at the Alamo, and was led by Albert Martin and George Kimbell, the latter of whom had been Dickinson's business partner. As they approached the Alamo in the early morning hours of March 1, a rider appeared in front of them and asked, in English, if they wished to go into the fort. When they assented, he turned and told them to follow him. One became suspicious and the rider bolted away. The volunteers were afraid they had been discovered and galloped towards the Alamo. In the darkness, the Texians thought this was a party of Mexican soldiers and fired, wounding one of the volunteers. They finally managed to convince the defenders to open the gates. At some point, either on March 3 or March 4, 1836, Travis, seeing that their position was hopeless and their fate sealed, called the troops of his garrison together. He informed them of the situation and gave them the opportunity to either stay or to go at that point. Only one man, Moses Rose, chose to flee, with the rest deciding to remain and fight to the death. He would be remembered, even to the present day, as the \\"Coward of the Alamo\\", while Dickinson and the rest of the defenders would achieve immortality as heroes. Climax of the battle and death Dickinson survived until the last day of the battle. In the early morning hours of March 6, 1836, Santa Anna sent an assault force which breached the walls of the Alamo with its third charge. Dickinson had hidden Suzanna and Angelina inside the chapel. By her own account afterward, near the end of the battle Dickinson rushed inside where she was hiding, frantically exclaiming \\"Great God, Sue! The Mexicans are inside our walls! All is lost! If they spare you, love our child.\\" He then returned to his post. By that time there was intense fighting inside the Alamo, which eventually became hand to hand. By reliable Mexican accounts, Dickinson was one of the last defenders killed in action. According to the Mexican Army accounts, the last of the Texians to die were the eleven men manning the two 12-lb cannon in the chapel. The entrance had been barricaded with sandbags, over which the Texians were able to fire. A shot from the 18-lb cannon destroyed the barricades and Mexican soldiers entered the building after firing an initial musket volley. Dickinson's crew fired their cannon from the apse into the soldiers at the door. With no time to reload, the Texians, including Dickinson, Gregorio Esparza, and James Bonham, grabbed rifles and fired before being bayoneted to death. Texian Robert Evans was master of ordnance and had been tasked with keeping the gunpowder from falling into Mexican hands. Wounded, he crawled towards the powder magazine but was killed by a musket ball with his torch only inches from the powder. If he had succeeded, the blast would have destroyed the chapel, killing the women and children hiding in the sacristy. Dickinson's body was burned along with those of the other defenders killed during the battle. Susannah, Angelina, and a freed former slave to Travis named Joe were spared. It is generally accepted that over the course of the battle, the Mexican forces lost an estimated 400 to 500 soldiers killed, while the Texian defenders suffered a total loss of between 182 and 189. Dickinson has since, along with many of the other defenders, become a legend in Texas history for the heroic stand.

History Sir Harry Verney, Bart The Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway Company was incorporated on 6 August 1860, and the line opened on 23 September 1868 connecting Aylesbury and Verney Junction and serving intermediate stations at Waddesdon Manor (renamed Waddesdon on 1 October 1920), Quainton Road, Grandborough (renamed Granborough Road on 6 October 1920), and Winslow Road. The A&BR; was never extended to Buckingham. In the late 1880s the Metropolitan Railway planned to extend its projected Aylesbury line northwards to , to make a junction with the East and West Junction Railway. Instead, the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway Company was absorbed by the Metropolitan Railway on 1 July 1891 and it thus formed the northward progress of the Metropolitan Railway. The section of line from Morton Pinkney to just north of Quainton Road railway station was built later as part of the London Extension of the Great Central Railway, joining the, by then, Metropolitan Railway tracks into London, and forming the Great Central Main Line which opened for passenger traffic on 15 March 1899. In April 1906 the Metropolitan Railway section from Harrow-on-the-Hill station to Verney Junction was leased to a Joint Committee of the Metropolitan Railway and Great Central Main Line: it was worked on a five-yearly basis alternately by the joint lessees. Passenger services on the line were withdrawn between Quainton Road and Verney Junction from 6 July 1936, having last run on the 4th, and the intermediate stations of Granborough Road and Winslow Road closed. The last through service, a parcels train from Verney Junction, was on 6 April 1947. The line was officially closed on 8 September 1947 but was retained as a siding to a point near Winslow Road until at least 1963. On 14 September that year a railtour ran on this part of the line. Current and future developments In December 2008 a section of track between Aylesbury and the newly opened Aylesbury Vale Parkway station was reinstated for regular passenger use. There are plans to continue the reinstatement north of Aylesbury Vale as part of new the East West Rail Consortium route around London. However the route would use only the section just to the north of Quainton Road, continuing via the Great Central route and the Calvert curve towards . There are no firm plans for stations between Aylesbury Vale and nor a reinstated station at Verney Junction.

Life Pereira was born at Ruzafa, near Valencia, in Spain. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1552 and taught successively literature, philosophy, theology, and sacred scripture in Rome, where he died. Works He published eight works, and left a vast deal of manuscript. (Sommervogel, infra, mentions twelve sets.) His main philosophical work is De communibus omnium rerum naturalium principiis et affectionibus libri quindecim (Rome, 1576). The main difficulties of the Book of Genesis are met in Commentariorum et disputationum in Genesim tomi quattuor (Rome, 1591‚Äì1599). This is a mine of information in regard to the Deluge, Noah's Ark, the Tower of Babel, etc., and was highly rated by Richard Simon (Histoire critique du Vieux Testament, III, xii). The \\"Commentariorum in Danielem prophetam libri sexdecim\\" (Rome, 1587) are much less diffuse. Other writings published by Pereira were five volumes of exegetical dissertations on: \\"Exodus\\", 137 dissertations (Ingolstadt, 1601); \\"The Epistle to the Romans\\", 188 dissertations (Ingolstadt, 1603); \\"The Apocalypse\\", 183 dissertations (Lyons, 1606); \\"The Gospel of St. John\\", 214 dissertations on the first nine chapters (Lyons, 1608); 144 dissertations on five following chapters (Lyons, 1610). To the fourth volume of the dissertations is appended a work of twenty- three dissertations to show that Mohammed was not the Antichrist, of the Apocalypse and of Daniel. Debate against Clavius Pereira was an outspoken opponent of Christopher Clavius at the Collegio Romano., p. 68 The debate concerned the nature of mathematics. Pereira argued that mathematical demonstrations point to complex relations between numbers, lines, figures, etc., but lack the logical force of a demonstration from true causes or the essence of things. Furthermore, mathematics does not have a true subject matter; it merely draws connections between different properties (Alexander, p. 69). Clavius responded in \\"Prolegomena\\" that the subject of mathematics is matter itself, since all mathematics is \\"immersed\\" in matter. The debate had broad ramifications with regard to inclusion of mathematics as a basic subject in the Jesuit curriculum.

Its original purpose was to describe and propose the ideal standard for poets writing in the Scottish tradition, a tradition which includes James' direct ancestor, James I (1394-1437).See for instance: The Kingis Quair: an Introduction. James VI, as a young poet-king, was both the head and patron of the Castalian Band, a fairly loose circle of court poets which he both established and composed with as peers in the 1580s and early 1590s. It is certain that the treatise was intended to set the aesthetic standard for the writing he wished to advocate. The Castalian poets included Alexander Montgomerie, William Fowler, William Alexander, John Stewart and Alexander Hume and others variously. James' patronage as Scottish king also attracted poets from Northern England, such as Thomas Hudson. Like most of James' writing, Reulis and Cautelis (Rules and Cautions) was written in his first language, Middle Scots. Because of its subject, it was one of the few manuscripts by the King that was not anglicised by his London publisher Thomas Waldegrave for publication in England.N Rhodes, J Richards, J Marshall (eds).

Background Flying Ebony was a dark bay or brown horse bred by John E. Madden, who had already bred four Kentucky Derby winners, and was raced by New York City carpet manufacturer, Gifford A. Cochran. In 1925, Flying Ebony's training was handled by future U.S. Hall of Fame member William B. Duke, who had returned from France that year where he had been training Thoroughbreds since 1888, notably for the Haras du Quesnay racing stable of Willie K. Vanderbilt. Racing career Top jockey Earl Sande was aboard for the Kentucky Derby in which good luck was on his side. A downpour just before racetime turned Churchill Downs into a quagmire that perfectly suited Flying Ebony, who won the 51st running of the Derby by one and a half lengths. This Derby was the first ever to be broadcast on the radio. Flying Ebony raced three more times after the Derby without winning and was retired to stud duty. Retirement and stud record His son Flying Heels, who raced for owner Gifford Cochran, won multiple top races such as the Pimlico Futurity, Remsen Handicap, Manhattan Handicap, and two editions of the Carter Handicap. Flying Ebony was also the sire of Dark Secret, the Wheatley Stable's colt who won several important races including two editions of the Jockey Club Gold Cup. Flying Ebony was eventually sold to Californian Charles Elliot Perkins, who stood him at his stud at his Alisal Ranch near Santa Barbara. Flying Ebony was humanely destroyed in the summer of 1943.

In the 16th to mid-17th centuries, the donas de fuera also played a role in the witch trials in Sicily.  The Fairies of Sicily  In historical Sicilian folklore, the do√±as de fuera would make contact with humans, mostly women, whom they took to Benevento (\\"the Blockula of Sicily\\"). The fairies were called do√±as de fuera, which was also a name for the women who associated with them. They were described as beauties dressed in white, red or black; they could be male or female, and their feet were the paws of cats, horses or of a peculiar \\"round\\" shape. They came in groups of five or seven and a male fairy played the lute or the guitar while dancing. The fairies and the humans were divided into companies in different sizes (different ones for noble and non-noble humans), under the lead of an ensign. Every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, the fairies met the humans belonging to their company in the woods. In March, several companies gathered, and their \\"Prince\\" instructed them to be benevolent creatures. A congregation called The Seven Fairies could transform themselves to cats and something called aydon; ayodons were able to kill. The fairies could easily be offended by humans. In one story, a man who was not associated with the fairies and was unable to see them developed a painful cramp after hitting one of the fairies who was listening to him play music. Another story involves several people who had disturbed the fairies while they nocturnally travelled from house to house, eating and drinking as they routinely embraced the town's infants. On those occasions, the person in question paid one of the people associated with the fairies to be the host of a dinner at their homes, meeting the fairies while the owners of the house slept. Between 1579 and 1651 there were a number of recorded witch trials in Sicily. The trial summaries, sent to the Spanish Inquisition's Suprema in Madrid by the Sicilian tribunal, reflected a total of 65 people, eight of them male, many of whom were believed to be associates of fairies, who were put on trial for sorcery. The Inquisition denounced them as witches, but often did not take these cases seriously as the accused never mentioned the Devil in their confessions. The Inquisition did occasionally associate meetings with the elves as events similar to a Witches' Sabbath, but as the local population generally held a positive view of the phenomena, the Inquisition did not press the matter. The accused said that they had become associated with the fairies because they had \\"Sweet blood\\", and that in most cases, went to the meetings in a non-corporeal fashion, leaving their actual bodies behind. This is similar to the concept of astral projection and was something they had in common with the Benandanti, a related group that also faced scrutiny by the Inquisition.  Witch trials in Sicily  Compared to surrounding countries, the witch trials in Sicily were relatively mild: in most cases, the accused were either freed, sentenced to exile, or jailed, rather than sentenced to death. Though the accused occasionally testified that some nobles took part in these activities, the accused themselves are generally described as poor, and most often, female. The accused evidently gave their testimonies to the Inquisition without being tortured. Fairy folklore was commonplace during this time and, according to reports, the accused were not ashamed of their actions, and some may not have realized their beliefs would be disliked by the Christian church. According to some of the accused, the fairies did not like speaking about the Christian God or the Virgin Mary, but despite this, the accused themselves did not regard this belief to be contrary to the values of Christianity. Ultimately, the Inquisition did not show much interest in the Sicilian fairy trials, instead attempting to make the accused change their freely given testimonies and direct it toward the traditional Witch's Sabbath that involved demons and devils rather than fairies. During the course of the trials they did succeed in some cases, but in general, the long-held belief that fairies were benevolent creatures remained in Sicily long after the Inquisition. In 1630, the medicine woman Vicencia la Rosa was sentenced to banishment and banned from ever mentioning anything about the elves again. After her sentence, la Rosa continued to tell stories about her personal elf named Martinillo, who took her to \\"Benevento\\" where she had sex and learned medicine. She was arrested again and exiled from Sicily for the rest of her life.  The fisherwife of Palermo  The fisherwife of Palermo was an unnamed Italian woman who was put on trial for witchcraft by the Sicilian Inquisition in Palermo in Sicily in 1588. She claimed to associate with fairies and her confession was among the first that describes contact between elves and humans on Sicily. Her case was among the first of many witch trials in Sicily associated with elves and her confession was typical for such elf-related cases. She told them that when she was a child of eight, she had flown through the air with a group of women on goats to a vast field on the mainland of the Kingdom of Naples called Benevento, where a red-coloured teenage boy and a beautiful woman sat on a throne. According to her confession, they were called the King and the Queen. She said that the leader of the women who took her there, who was called the Ensign, told her that if she fell to her knees in front of the King and Queen of the elves and gave them allegiance, they would give her riches, beauty and handsome men, with whom she could have sex, and that she was not to worship God or the holy Virgin. The Ensign also added that she should not mention the Virgin Mary, as it was bad manners to do so in the presence of the Elves. The fisherwife then agreed to worship the King as a god and the Queen as a goddess, and she swore her allegiance in a book containing many letters which was held for her by the ensign, and promised her body and soul to the divine couple. After this, tables with food were set forward, and everyone ate, drank and had sex with each other. She also claimed that she had sex with multiple men in a short period of time, after which she reported that she had awoken as if from a dream. She claimed that she was not aware that this was sinful before the priest told her, after she had told him this, that such things were the work of Satan. She said that she had continued with it anyway, because it had made her so happy. On some occasions, she said, the elves had fetched her before she had gone to sleep for the night to prevent her husband and children from noticing anything. She claimed that she was awake the whole time. She also stated that the King and Queen had given her medicine to cure the sick, so she could earn money and alleviate her poverty. = Protocol of statement = The protocol of the Inquisition states how the fisherwife and the other women flew through the air on goats to: > a land called Benevento which belongs to the Pope and is situated in the > kingdom of Naples. There was a field and in its center a platform with two > chairs. On one was a red teenage boy and on the other a beautiful woman, > whom the called the Queen, and the man was the king. The first time she came > there -she was eight- the \\"ensign\\" and the other women in her company told > her that she must kneel and worship the king and the queen and to all they > commanded for they could help her and give her riches, beauty and young men > to make love to. And they told her not to worship God or the holy Virgin. > The Ensign made her swear on a book with large letters that she would > worship the two others. The king as if he was God and the Queen as if she > was the holy virgin, and gave herself to them with body and soul.....And > after she had so worshipped them, they made the tables and ate and drank, > and thereafter the men had intercourse with the women and with her many > times in a short period of time. All of this seem to her as if a dream, for > when she awoke, she did so in her bed, naked as if she had gone to rest. But > sometimes they had called upon her before she had gone to bed so that her > husband and children would not notice it, and without having gone to sleep > before (as far as she could tell), she left and arrived fully clothed. She > further claimed that she at that time did not realise that it was sinful > before her confessor had opened her eyes and told her that it was Satan and > that she was not allowed to do it further, but she still continued it until > two months ago. And she left filled with happiness of the joy she received > from it....and because (the king and the queen) gave her means to cure the > sick so that she could earn some money, because she had always been poor After this freely given statement, the Inquisition interrogated her and asked her leading questions. The attitude of the Inquisition was that fairies did not exist, but were a remnant of pagan superstition which should be eradicated and not be taken seriously. Therefore, the events she described must have been either a dream, in which case they could accept her story about the fairies, or, if it did happen, it must have been a witch's sabbath. Therefore, they asked her leading questions to make her identify the events as either a dream or reality. If it were the former, she would be released, and if it were the latter, she would be a witch. The fisherwife, however, passed this interrogation of leading questions: the protocols state that in the end, she came to the conclusion that \\"all of this seem to her to have happened as if in a dream\\", and that it had truly all been just a dream, \\"as far as she could estimate the matter\\".

The organisation's website states that its vision is to bring the whole good news of Jesus Christ within the legal world. History The Lawyers' Christian Fellowship was founded in 1852 as the Lawyers' Prayer Union, and was subsequently renamed Lawyers' Christian Fellowship. The LCF states on its website that it has a long history of uniting and equipping Christian lawyers and witnessing to members of the legal profession. The LCF claims that in its 150 years of activity it has impacted both individual lives and the wider legal landscape through its commitment to the Bible's teaching. Since its inception as a prayer union, the scope of LCF's work has grown with the support of such patrons as Lord Denning and Lord Mackay of Clashfern. In 2008 they made representations regarding the passing of the Human Fertilisation and Embryo Bill. Current activity Based in Southwark, work of the LCF has developed into three main areas: the legal workplace, amongst law students and young lawyers and internationally. Local workplace groups meet across the UK to study, pray and encourage evangelism. The LCF has particularly strong international links in East Africa, where the organisation partners with Christian lawyers and legal aid projects in Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda. The support from the LCF includes sending interns, teams of law students and practitioners, and financial support. The LCF also has links with Christian legal groups in the US, Europe and Burundi and Mozambique. Vision According to the LCF website, its members aim \\"to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God\\" (Micah 6:8). The LCF website states that the LCF's vision is encouraging its members to: * Speak the good news: from within the legal profession. * Live the good news: living as godly lawyers. * Apply the good news: applying God's justice on the ground. * Promote the good news: working for good laws. The LCF also believes in enabling its members through information, teaching, and support to fulfill their full potential as lawyers for Christ. They believe in witnessing to the legal profession by speaking of the Christian gospel and demonstrating God's character of justice and compassion by upholding Christian values in the administration of law at home and overseas. Notable media coverage In May 2008, the British current affairs programme, Dispatches, presented a feature entitled In God's Name. The programme explored the growing influence of the Christian evangelical movement in the UK and highlighted LCF's involvement in lobbying the UK government on issues such as abortion, gay rights and laws relating to blasphemy. The activities of the then LCF Director of Public Policy, Andrea Minichiello Williams, were examined, including footage of her meetings with Conservative politicians Norman Tebbit and Nadine Dorries. Williams was reported as making a number of controversial statements, including claims that the Human Fertilisation bill was \\"the work of the devil\\", that abortion should be illegal, homosexuality is sinful and the world is just 4,000 years old. Williams no longer works for LCF and is presently employed by Christian Concern.

The diocese was restored in 1961. It is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels. Its see is the Cathedral of Our Lady. History In the Middle Ages Antwerp was within the see of Cambrai. In 1559, at the instance of Philip II of Spain, a new arrangement of the episcopal sees of the Low countries was made by Pope Paul IV. Three archiepiscopal and fourteen episcopal sees were created, and all external jurisdiction, however ancient, abolished. Antwerp became one of the six suffragans of Mechlin, and remained such until the end of the eighteenth century. This step did not meet with the goodwill of the merchants of the city, who feared the introduction of the Inquisition and the costliness of an episcopal establishment, and urged the transfer of the new see to Leuven, where it would be less offensive to the non-Catholic elements of their city. Catholic monastic interests were active, being now called on by the Pope to provide for the support of the new see. Finally, the famous theologian Franciscus Sonnius (from Son in Brabant) was transferred from the diocese of Bois-le-Duc to Antwerp in 1569 as first bishop of the new see, and governed it until his death in 1576. Ten years of religious and political conflict elapsed before another bishop could be appointed in the person of Laevinus Torrentius (Lieven van der Beken or Li√©vin van der Beken), a Leuven theologian, graceful humanist, and diplomat. He died in 1595. The scholarly Joannes Miraeus (or Le Mire) was Bishop of Antwerp from 1604 to 1611, and was succeeded in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by a series of fifteen bishops, the last of whom was Cornelius Franciscus Nelis, librarian of the University of Leuven and Bishop of Antwerp from 1785 to his death in 1798. In accordance with the Concordat of 1801, Pope Pius VII suppressed the see on 29 November 1801, by the Bull Qui Christi Domini vices, its former Belgian territory transferred to the Archdiocese of Mechlin, the Dutch portion to the Diocese of Breda.Johannes Franciscus Foppens, Historia Episcopatus Antuerpiensis, Brussels, 1717; Ram, Synopsis actorum eccl., Antwerp, Brussels, 1856. The diocese was restored in 1961 by Pope John XXIII. It comprises the territory of the Belgian province of Antwerp, minus eight municipalities in the south which belong to Mechelen-Brussels including Bonheiden, Duffel, Mechelen and Sint-Katelijne-Waver, and the municipality of Zwijndrecht, which belongs to the Diocese of Ghent. The abbeys and convents of Antwerp were long very famous centres of its religious life. In the twelfth century the Canons Regular of St. Norbert (Premonstratensians) founded the abbey of St. Michael, that would become one of the principal abbeys of the Low Countries, sheltered many royal guests, and eventually excited greed and persecution by reason of its wealth. The Cathedral of Antwerp was originally a small Premonstratensian shrine known familiarly as \\"Our Lady of the Stump.\\" Many other religious orders found a shelter in Antwerp, Dominicans, Franciscans (1446), Carmelites (1494), Carthusians (1632), and female branches of the same. The Cistercians had two great abbeys, St. Sauveur, founded in 1451 by the devout merchant Peter Pot, and St. Bernard, about six miles from Antwerp, founded in 1233.Papebroch, \\"Annales Antuerpienses,\\" to the year 1600, ed.

Early years \\"Brian O' Brien was born in Denver, Colorado in 1898 to Michael Phillip and Lina Prime O' Brien. His education started in the Chicago Latin School from 1909‚Äì1915, and continued at the Yale Sheffield scientific school where he earned a Ph.B. in 1918 and a Ph.D. in 1922. He also did course work at MIT and Harvard. In 1922 he married Ethel Cornelia Dickerman and they had one son, Brian, Jr. After Ethel Cornelia died, he married a second time to Mary Nelson Firth in 1956. He was a research engineer at Westinghouse Electric Co. from 1922 to 1923. During this period he developed, along with Joseph Slepian, the auto-valve lightning arrester, which is still in use. In 1923 he moved to J. N. Adam Memorial hospital in Perrysburg, N.Y., a tuberculosis sanitarium run by Buffalo's Public Health Department. Prior to the use of antibiotics, the primary treatment for tuberculosis was fresh air and sunshine. There was some evidence that sun tanning did help in the remission of the disease, but Perrysburg‚Äî40 miles south of Buffalo‚Äîhad very little sunshine in the winter. Therefore, O'Brien, as a physicist on staff, developed a carbon arcs with cored carbons that very closely matched the solar spectrum. With this development the patients could have sun therapy year-round. Due to a general interest in biological effects of solar radiation, he published some of the early work on the ozone layer and erythema caused by the sun. O'Brien moved to the University of Rochester in 1930 to hold the chair of physiological optics. Shortly thereafter he became the director of the Institute of Optics. His continuing interest in the biological effects of solar radiation led to research in vitamin chemistry. The need for vitamin D, especially in the diet of children, had been recognized for preventing rickets. At that time there was no synthetic vitamin D, but the dehydrocholesterol in milk can be converted to vitamin D by radiation with ultraviolet light. The carbon arcs developed at Perrysburg were an ideal source of ultraviolet, but for proper irradiation, the milk had to be in a very thin film. ... A film of high enough flow volume for commercial application was produced, and vitamin D-fortified milk became widespread.\\"Stroud 2004: pp. 58-59 War and peace: 1940 - 1953 \\"By the end of 1940, The Institute of Optics was already involved with optical problems for government agencies; by the end of the academic year 1941-42, it was becoming more and more deeply involved.\\"Stroud 2004: pp. 43 At the time the Institute was dealing with a spike in number of students and attempted to tailor the curriculum for military usefulness. O' Brien's right-hand man was R.E. Hopkins, a young instructor with a B.S. from MIT who had just received his MS from the Institute of Optics, helping with lens design and geometrical optics. The National Defense Research council became involved with the Institute December 1942 and continued the relationship until January 1946. They were looking for someone to make infrared sensitive phosphors. Franz Urbach, an escaped Viennese expert, was working in the physics department and was quietly transferred to the Institute of Optics to help develop the \\"metascopes\\" for night vision. It was in relation to this work, in 1948, that Albert Noyes and O'Brien were awarded The Medal of Merit by President Harry S. Truman, the highest civilian award given by government. In a report sent to President Valentine, O' Brien estimated that the Institute had \\"spent\\" about one million dollars for the war effort \\"including overhead allowances to the University.\\"Stroud 2004: pp. 44 There was also a marked increase in undergraduate students during this time period. Recognizing his own personal research involvement O' Brien decided to no longer accept graduate students. The Institute emerged from the war a little brighter and a little less worse for wear. However the school still had a very small faculty, \\"only one full- time professor and a few junior faculty.\\"Stroud 2004: pp. 45 Despite this limitation \\"five master's degrees and two Ph.D.s were awarded to students already enrolled.\\" In his '47 report, O'Brien pointed out the number of government and industry requests made for the Institute to conduct research. He enjoyed the projects, but recognized the research would get in the way of \\"quality teaching ... and that fair balance must be achieved.\\"Stroud 2004: pp. 46 He decided he was much more interested \\"guiding research and advanced degree students than in the tiresome details of undergraduate instruction.\\" M. Parker Givens, a Cornell Ph.D, joined the Institute during this growth spurt. This permitted an increase in students. \\"Fourteen, he said, should be graduating, in 1948, and the total student enrollment was 53, about equally divided through the classes.\\" One of the hallmark innovations developed following the war was a camera with a six-inch f/1 lens for night aerial work, \\"giving excellent definition over a curved surface, the film being curved by compressed air between the lens and film.\\" Another, first described at a meeting of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers in 1949, was a high-speed camera, \\"used for observations at the Bikini bomb test, later much improved to make rapid sequences of pictures at speeds up to 20 million frames per second.\\" NotesReferences  * * External links * Memorial Tributes: National Academy of Engineering, Volume 7 * Air Force Space Command: High Frontier - Not Related to Reconnaissance in Any Way: An Interview with Dr. F.

An Explanatory Memorandum was issued with the Regulations and a fuller Explanatory Memorandum presented to Parliament. The Architects Act 1997 had resulted from the policy of allowing certain restrictions to apply (for well over 60 years, in the United Kingdom) to the use of the simple word \\"architect\\" in connection with a statutory Register of Architects operated under Westminster primary legislation by which the executant body was renamed as the Architects Registration Board from 1997 (previously the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom). The amendment (under the European Communities Act 1972) has introduced pages of complicated text to a piece of legislation which was otherwise tolerably trim, neat and comprehensible in its consolidated form in the 1997 Act. But the amendment has been made pursuant to a European Directive made in 2005Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and the treaty obligations binding upon the United Kingdom and other states of the European Union, and in that respect an amendment under the European Directive was inevitable. Non-departmental public body The Architects Registration Board has been assigned the function of the \\"competent authority\\" which has to be designated by every European Union state. It has been classed as a \\"non- departmental public body\\" in the language being used by government departments. The majority of the Board is appointed by one such government department under the provisions of the Architects Act 1997. Impact In connection with architects registration in the United Kingdom it is likely that as a result of the amendment of 2008 there will be a commensurate need to expand the human and other resources employed for giving effect to the additional activity prescribed for the Architects Registration Board to perform; and that the impact upon the annual fee which the Act enables the Board to demand is unlikely to be favourable to architects in the United Kingdom who, by application or retention, choose to become registrants on what, by the amendment, has become \\"Part 1\\" of the Register. The general effect on teaching and practice, or on the inter-disciplinary process in the service of the built environment, is uncertain. Independent observers may consider (as had the author of the Warne Report, concerning the reform of architects registration which preceded the amending legislation of 1996) that the public is best served by means of statutory regulations of universal application (such as Building Regulations) on the one hand and arrangements free from the taint of monopoly on the other (for which see the article on the Warne Report and the legislative changes concerning trade descriptions and consumer protection, introduced in May 2008, that are referred to in the article on Architects Registration in the United Kingdom).

They all have similarly shaped flowers (which led to the name turtlehead due to their resemblance to the head of a turtle), which vary in color from white to red, purple or pink. Chelone cuthbertii, C. glabra, and C. lyonii are diploid and C. obliqua is either tetraploid or hexaploid, depending on their slight differences in morphology and localities. Relationships to other plants The closest relative of Chelone is Nothochelone from western North America. [3] [6] Nothochelone nemerosa is the species most closely related to the genus [3] [6]. Chelone is more closely related to it than to other members of the family such as snapdragons, plantains, and foxglove. Species Chelone cuthbertii is found in two areas: the Blue Ridge of North Carolina and the coastal plain of Virginia. [5] [6] Chelone glabra is the most widely distributed species of the genus: from Georgia to Newfoundland and from Mississippi to Manitoba; [5] [6] the other three are found in more restricted areas. Chelone lyonii is found in the Blue Ridge of Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina. [5] [6] Chelone obliqua is found as tetraploids in the Blue Ridge, or hexaploids in two areas: Tennessee to Arkansas and Michigan, or the Atlantic coastal plain from South Carolina to Maryland. [5] [6] The relationship between the different populations is complicated and it appears that C. obliqua in fact has arisen several times from diploid ancestors of the other three species.

Land registry Under Jordanian rule, land in Issawiya was registered under the owner's name, but registration stopped in 1967.

He is not the same person as the Scoto-Norman poet William the Clerk, who wrote the Roman de Fergus, sometimes wrongly attributed to the Norman. William was married with a family. Both the Catholic Encyclopedia and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (ODB) maintains that he lived for a time in England, but it remains that he did not write in the Anglo-Norman dialect. He was originally from Normandy and his works suggest that he resided in the Diocese of Lichfield in England. William authored \\"six religio-didactic works for lay audiences\\" (ODB). The oldest, dated to 1210 or 1211, and most popular--it survives in twenty manuscripts--is the Bestiaire divin (\\"Divine Bestiary\\"), a work of natural history and theology. It is dated on the basis of a reference to the sad state of the English Church in 1208. It contains many descriptions of animal life. It is dedicated to William's lord, a certain Radulphus, whose name is the object of an etymology given in the epilogue. Radulphus may be Ralph of Maidstone, who was treasurer of Lichfield in 1215. The Bestiaire was given several printings between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. William's also wrote the Vie de Tobie for one William, prior of Kenilworth in Arden (1214‚Äì27), also in the diocese of Lichfield, and Les joies de notre Dame (or nostre Dame), which survives in only a single manuscript. The legendary Vie de Sainte Marie- Madeleine, a short biography of Mary Magdalene, belongs to an unknown date. The Besant de Dieu, an allegorical poem, William composed in 1226 or 1227. For this William drew on several recent events: the publication of De miseria conditionis humanae by Pope Innocent III, the Fourth Crusade, the interdict placed on England by Innocent in 1208‚Äì13, the Albigensian Crusade, and the Albigensian campaigns of Louis VIII of France. William also comments on the oppression of the peasantry by their rulers. William's last piece, Les treis moz de l'evesque de Lincoln, was written between 1227 and 1238 for Alexander Stavensby, the Bishop of Lichfield. Several fabliaux have been erroneously assigned to William: Du prestre et d'Alison, La male honte, and La fille √† la bourgeoise. There is no grounds for these ascriptions.

He was the second son, and third child of Sir John Gladstone and the brother of William Ewart Gladstone who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom four times. Robertson was a successful merchant, businessman, property developer and local politician. One of the youngest men elected Mayor of Liverpool, he was religious but increasingly tolerant of nonconformity, emphasised by a move towards semi-socialist politics. Early years Robertson, along with his siblings was brought up in Liverpool at the Gladstone home in Rodney Street and then at Seaforth House from 1813. He studied at Eton College along with his older brothers Thomas and William.George W. E. Russell, The Right Honourable William Ewart Gladstone (Harper & Brothers Publishers, New York, 1891) However, he did not seem to have the motivation to become a politician and his father felt that Eton did not suit him. The incessant beatings from Mr Keate the headmaster were deemed necessary if the Gladstones were to earn a rite of passage into the upper- middle class. John Gladstone decided that Robertson, entirely at his own concurrence, should become a merchant, first as his assistant, and then as partner.Jenkins, Gladstone, pp.9-10 In September 1821, sixteen-year-old Robertson was sent to attend Glasgow College, where his cousin Steuart Gladstone studied before becoming an intelligent merchant-businessman. John Gladstone's sister, Mary, and her husband, Dr John Nimmo, lived in Glasgow, and Robertson boarded there with his aunt and uncle while he studied mathematics, moral philosophy and natural philosophy at the university.S. G. Checkland The Gladstones: a family history 1764‚Äì1851, (Cambridge University Press 1971 ) He then returned to Liverpool work in the offices of his father's company. On 28 September 1827 Gladstone travelled with his brother Thomas to spend the winter in Naples. Whilst there they viewed an eruption of Vesuvius. On his return to England he proposed that he should be allowed to visit the family estates in the West Indies, and his father agreed. Leaving on 12 October 1828 he travelled to Demerara, British Guiana, arriving in November and remained for three months until March 1829. Robertson Gladstone made a record of this journey in his Journal of a Voyage & Residence in the Colony of Demerara which is held in the library of the Liverpool Athenaeum. He returned to England via the United States of America where he stopped in at Philadelphia. In 1830, Gladstone built a home at Cuckoo Lane, Woolton, Liverpool. In 1833 he joined a freemason's lodge in Liverpool. He was the first Mayor of Liverpool under the age of forty, and as he got older his politics moved to the left, as with his youngest brother William. Robertson was a large, slightly depressive man-mountain of 20 stones. He had a large family of children who were all spinsters and bachelors, and his home life was entirely dependent on his wife's talent for housekeeping. Her death in 1865 left him bereft. Marriage and family Gladstone became engaged at age 30 to Mary Ellen Jones (d. 23 September 1865), daughter of a notable local banker, Hugh Jones. They married on 28 January 1836 in St George's Church, Liverpool. The marriage caused disagreements within the Gladstone family: the Jones family were unitarians, while the Gladstones were evangelicals of the Church of England. After the marriage a mansion house called Court Hey Hall was built in the same year as their family home. They had eight children together. # John Gladstone (b. 1838 - d. 13 October 1852 at Court Hey) # Mary Ellen Gladstone (b. 1840 - d. 17 September 1895) # Arthur Robertson Gladstone, Capt (b. 1841 - d. 30 March 1896, late of Court Hey) # Hugh Jones Gladstone (b. 1843 - d. 1 September 1874 at Court Hey) # Robertson Gladstone (b. 14 September 1844 - d.

Political and community activities  Active in radical Liverpool politics, he was elected as one of the councilors in Liverpool's Abercromby ward as part of the 1838 Municipal Elections. This was his third attempt at taking the seat, which was reported as a \\"The scene of a great Tory triumph, however it was achieved.\\"The Municipal Election - Liverpool Mercury, Friday 2 November 1838; Issue 1434. He served as mayor of the city between 1842 and 1843. In 1846 he was one of the 'gentlemen' present during the visit of Prince Albert to the Liverpool Sailors' Home. As a measure of his continued importance he was still a member of seven of the thirteen town council committees in 1859. In 1862 he unsuccessfully supported Charles Mozley as candidate for mayor. In November 1863 he again proposed him for mayor, and with a majority of five Mozley became the first Jewish mayor of Liverpool. He was also a Justice of the Peace (J.P.) for Lancashire, a trustee of the Liverpool Union Mill and Bread Company and a member of the Health Committee.  Commercial interests  In the fullness of time after his marriage, Robertson obtained a partnership in Heywood's Bank, where his father-in-law was a partner. In August 1845 he was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Grand Junction Railway and was also on the committee of the Birmingham and Oxford Junction Railway. Robertson was part owner in plantations in West Indies and Mauritius, as well as the Trent Valley line, Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway and several other rail lines. He was the first President of the Liverpool Financial Reform Association after it was instituted at 6 York Buildings, Dale Street, Liverpool on 20 April 1848., a body which was noted as \\"the most persistent and single-minded free trade body England had ever known\\". Robertson inherited his father's Liverpool firm after John Gladstone's death in 1851. His Gladstonian principle of thrift and self- help for financial reform can be neatly summarised in the following notice of 2 February 1852: OBJECTS. 1\\\\. To use all lawful and constitutional means of including the most rigid economy in the expenditure of the Government, consistent with due efficiency in the several departments in the public service. 2\\\\. To advocate the adoption of a simple and equitable system of direct taxation, fairly levied upon property and income, in lieu of the present unequal, complicated, and expensively collected duties upon commodities. Political partisanship is distinctly disowned, the Association being composed of men of all political parties. ROBERTSON GLADSTONE, President Gladstone purchased the patronage of St Andrew's Church in Renshaw Street, Liverpool, a church which was built by his father. He was also the owner of 24 Abercromby Square which is now part of the University of Liverpool. Robertson owned many properties in Liverpool's bourgeois merchant district, all of which were sold at auction on his death. Five years after marriage he became more tolerant of religious difference, in contrast to William's High Anglicanism. Perhaps this was partly due to localism in his character, and partly his wife's unitarian background in nonconformity.Jenkins, p.73 But in any event it did not impair the success of his commercial ventures. He developed the land north of Seaforth that was used for the new dockyards, while the house itself was allowed go derelict. The deal put together in late 1853 with partner, brother William resumed their old friendship in the city of their birth. The family-minded celebrated the two churches father, John had built, confirming the Gladstones infinite capacity for nostalgia.Jenkins, ibid., pp.179-80 He lost around ¬£6,000 of his brother William's share of the Seaforth estate.  Later life and death  He died on 23 September 1875 at Court Hey. Much of his extensive property portfolio was sold at a Liverpool auction the following year between 7 and 9 February. This included dozens of homes on Liverpool‚Äôs most prestigious streets including a row of townhouses in Rodney Street and stables, workshops and homes in Dale Street and Hope Street. The executors of his estate were his sons Robertson and Arthur. His will was \\"proved in the Liverpool District Court of Probate. The personalty was sworn under ¬£120,000. A sum of ¬£500 was bequeathed to local charities and schools.\\"  Notes  References = Bibliography  * Births, Deaths, Marriages and Obituaries - Liverpool Mercury, Friday 28 December 1849; Issue 2154. * * The Liverpool Mercury, Newspaper articles, 1800‚Äì1900 * * Category:1805 births Category:1875 deaths Category:British classical liberals Category:Younger sons of baronets Category:Politicians from Liverpool Robertson Gladstone Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Councillors in Liverpool Category:Mayors of Liverpool ","title":"Robertson Gladstone"},{"id":"18062169","text":"Gilles Berolatti (born 4 May 1944) is a French fencer and olympic champion in foil competition.

It was first broadcast on CBS over three nights in November 1983. It was directed by Jerry London, and stars Charlton Heston, Keith Carradine, Stephen Collins, Danny Glover, Wayne Rogers, and Billy Dee Williams. It received three Emmy Award nominations and one Eddie Award nomination. Plot The miniseries is set in the fictional town of Delano, Georgia, loosely modeled after Manchester, Georgia, situated at the base of Pine Mountain, itself based on the Pine Mountain Range overlooking Manchester. The plot follows three generations of Delano police chiefs - Will Henry Lee (Wayne Rogers), Sonny Butts (Brad Davis), and Tyler Watts (Billy Dee Williams) - as they investigate a series of murders. The story begins in 1924 as town patriarch Hugh Holmes (Charlton Heston), whose character intermittently narrates the story, decides that the town has grown large enough to require a jail and a full-time police officer. The town appoints farmer Lee its first police chief, and, even though he has no law-enforcement experience, Lee becomes known as fair-minded and effective. Lee's farm employs a black family, the Coles, who regard their new and less benevolent employer, the Ku Klux Klan member Hoss Spence, with trepidation. Not long after his appointment, Chief Lee has to investigate the death of a young boy who fell down a ravine while apparently fleeing an attack that had sexual characteristics. He also discovers that a number of other young male vagrants and hitch-hikers have been observed traveling towards Delano, but have not been seen leaving the area. He is unable to obtain the cooperation of Sheriff 'Skeeter' Willis or the police chiefs of the neighboring counties, in pursuing his investigations. Despite this, Lee discovers that loner \\"Foxy\\" Funderburke (Keith Carradine) is responsible for the boys' murders, but Lee is mistakenly shot by a delirious man (his former employee Jesse Cole) before he can arrest Funderburke. Funderburke hovers in the background in the hospital room while the dying Lee tries to gasp out the truth about his guilt, but Lee's wife fails to understand. Despite the feverish delirium that caused him to believe that the police chief was trying to kill his son, Jesse Cole is executed, but not before urging his son Joshua to run away. Now again free from suspicion, Funderburke continues a decades long spree of sexually motivated murders. Shortly after World War II, violent Army veteran Sonny Butts is appointed to the post of assistant police chief in Delano because he is a war hero. When the serving chief dies of a heart attack, the city council appoints Butts to fill the vacancy. Butts figures out Funderburke's guilt, just as town father Holmes tells Butts he is about to take his badge due to a series of depredations culminating in Butts's murder of a Medgar Evers-like figure. Sure that solving the decades-long mystery will save his job, Butts goes to Funderburke's land and catches him in the very act of burying his latest victim. But as Butts chortles over his victory, letting down his guard, Funderburke strikes Butts with the shovel in his hands, shoots Butts with his own police revolver, and buries his body on the spot‚Äîalong with his police motorcycle. No one makes the connection between the disappearance of Butts and the long-unsolved murders. Running parallel to the story of the continual investigation is that of Chief Lee's son, Billy. A young boy at the time of his father's death, Billy Lee comes home from World War II an officer and war hero. He becomes a lawyer and, boldly for the time and place, a liberal. He enters politics and becomes first a state senator, then lieutenant governor, and there is talk of his elevation to national office. Around that time, Tyler Watts, a retired, decorated military officer and experienced criminal investigator, takes the bold step for a black man in 1962 of applying for the vacant position of police chief in a southern town. With the support of Billy Lee and Mayor Holmes, Watts is appointed police chief of Delano, however much to the silent disapproval of the all-white council whose members were not initially aware of Watts's ethnic background when Billy Lee read out Watts's r√©sum√© to them. In these respects, Chief Lee's son, Billy, is acting in a manner similar to that of Jimmy Carter, who was from Plains, Georgia, and who also served in the state senate and as Governor of Georgia, and who then ran for, and was elected to, the office of President of the United States. Like everyone else, Billy Lee assumes that Watts is a genuine newcomer in town. He does not recognize Watts as his boyhood friend Joshua Cole, son of the man who shot his father, because the child fled the town following the shooting and assumed another name. Watts encounters resistance from some members of his own force and from Sheriff Skeeter Willis, all of whom resent the arrival of a black chief of police. Yet Watts also uncovers the truth of the unsolved serial murders and of Funderburke's guilt. Unable to obtain a local search warrant for Funderburke's farm, Watts and Lee seek the FBI's assistance in the case. One of the FBI agents accompanying Chief Watts trips over the jutting handlebar of Butts's buried police motorcycle. As the agents begin digging up the dirt with their bare hands, Funderburke goes for his shotgun, and wounds Watts in the arm. Then Funderburke is immediately shot to death himself by the agents, thus escaping a public reckoning for four decades of murders. Aged Holmes grieves for his town as the bodies of young boy after young boy are unearthed from the ground surrounding Funderburke's house (evoking the discovery of the bodies of the victims of John Wayne Gacy). Watts, however, is now an acknowledged hero, and he decides to tell Billy Lee who he really is. Distribution Chiefs premiered on CBS as a six-hour miniseries. The first two hours aired beginning at 8pm November 13, 1983. The second part aired November 15 at 9pm, and the final part aired November 16 at 9pm. Reception John J. O'Connor of The New York Times said Chiefs was \\"an ambitious yet flawed project that overall, works powerfully well.\\" Director London has \\"a keen sense of what the sweeping saga entails, though there are weaknesses.\\" He criticized the ending of the miniseries for not following the novel's ending, in which Holmes realizes that, for all the decades of work he did to make Delano a decent place, it will now always be remembered as the site of a perverted series of murders; the film, by contrast, ends with Lee and Watts recognizing each other and embracing in an upbeat moment of friendship. Nevertheless, he noted that the performances of Davis (Sonny Butts), Sorvino (Skeeter), Carradine (Foxy Funderburke), and Glover (Marshall Peters) were outstanding. Among the flaws is a whipping scene in which a young white man is flogged, supposedly for having sexual intercourse with a black woman. The scriptwriters have that backwards. In the years of segregation, continuing the tradition since slavery, a young white man was free to gain experience with a willing (or perhaps even unwilling) black woman. What terrified white southerners was the thought of a black man having sex with a white woman. This historical inaccuracy may have been included because the white man is the implied victim of homosexual rape at the hands of Foxy Funderburke (Carradine), and the thought of a white man and a black man engaging in homosexual sex‚Äîor, indeed, of men of the same color having homosexual sex‚Äîwould have been equally or more repugnant to the sensibilities of the time.

Gass, published in 1966. Writing and publication Gass began writing Omensetter's Luck around 1954. He was working on the last chapter of the novel in 1958 when the manuscript was stolen off of his desk, forcing him to begin rewriting the book from scratch. He says of this time, \\"I was in a funk, a kind of fugue state. I reconstructed the book by working almost nonstop for about six months.\\" The novel was eventually published in 1966 and has gone through many editions, both foreign and domestic, and remains in print today. Plot Omensetter's Luck takes place in the 1890s in the fictitious town of Gilean, Ohio. The story is bookended by the story of Brackett Omensetter who arrives with his family to settle down. The middle (and the bulk) of the novel is devoted to the spiritual and mental degradation of the town's priest, Jethro Furber, who is jealous of Omensetter's magnetic personality and the luck that seems to underpin Omensetter's existence. After a meeting to receive his monthly rent, Omensetter's landlord, Henry Pimber, disappears and is found much later, dead. Omensetter's luck changes soon after, forcing him to abandon Gilean, leaving the locals to question the role of Omensetter in Pimber's death. Style Omensetter's Luck employs many literary techniques associated with the modernist literary movement, such as the inclusion of several unreliable narrators and the use of stream of consciousness. The novel is structured in three sections: \\"The Triumph of Israbestis Tott,\\" \\"The Love and Sorrow of Henry Pimber,\\" and \\"The Reverend Jethro Furber's Change of Heart,\\" each of which is narrated in the third person. The Jethro Furber section, which is told in stream of consciousness and takes up the majority of the novel, is reported by many readers to be the most difficult section to follow.

It is slightly sweeter than London Dry, but slightly drier than the Dutch Jenever, thus is sometimes called \\"the missing link\\".Cocktail-DB - Profile (accessed 21 June 2008) The name Old Tom Gin purportedly came from wooden plaques shaped like a black cat (an \\"Old Tom\\") mounted on the outside wall of some pubs above a public walkway in 18th- century England. Owing to the Gin Craze, the British government tried to stem the flow of gin with prohibitive taxes and licensing, which drove the scene underground. Under the cat's paw sign were a slot to put money in and a lead tube. From the tube would come a shot of gin, poured by the bartender inside the pub. Old Tom Gin was formerly made under licence by a variety of distillers around the world; however, one was recently relaunched by Hayman's distillery based on an original recipe. Since then a number of other companies have followed suit, such as: Booth's; Secret Treasures; The Liberty Distillery; Tanqueray; Langley's; Jensens; Ransom; Master of Malt; The Dorchester Hotel; The London Distillery Company Ltd; and Sacred Spirits. An Old Tom Gin made by J. Wray and Nephew Ltd. of Jamaica is also commonly found on the market. Old Tom Gin is specified for Jerry Thomas' cocktail called the Martinez in his 1887 Bartender's Guide, How to Mix All Kinds of Plain and Fancy Drinks. The first record of it being used in the Tom Collins cocktail was the 1891 book, The Flowing Bowl: When and What to Drink.

It was founded in 2004 by the British activist Alexander McLean, who is currently the director.  Organizational history  Donated books arriving at Kamiti Prison In 2004, Alexander McLean was volunteering at the Mulago hospital in Kampala, Uganda. He worked with a group of prisoners from Luzira Upper Prison. McLean observed that prison inmates were chained to their beds, with no opportunity for sanitation and no proper medical care. Despite of being terminally ill, many patients were left unsupervised. McLean visited the prison during his stay. He purchased materials to renovate the prison's infirmary, and with the support of the prison authorities, supervised the prisoners while they were renovating their own infirmary. One of the questions McLean posed to the inmates was about their needs, he observed an expressed desire for education. McLean returned to the UK where he fundraised and collected books to provide health care facilities to prisons in Uganda and for the establishment of a library at Luzira Upper Prison, to bring education about the law to prison inmates. This event marked the beginning of APP. Today, McLean is a member of the Tearfund Inspired Individuals Programme, along with Kelvin Mwikya.  Projects  APP is a growing UK charity and registered NGO in East Africa, with permanent bases in Kampala and Nairobi, the APP community consists of local full-time staff members and a small group of permanent volunteers in the UK. There are a number of projects that APP is leading on, as part of the recently launched 2017 - 2020 strategy. A key priority area of work is establishing the world's first prison-based law college and law firm, in addition to launching the Okimanyi Project in Kenya. As APP continues to evolve and offer basic health and education services, the organization will continue to focus on access to justice and creating robust programmatic structures which will be handed over to Ugandan Prisons Service (UPS) as a legacy project.  Condemned Choirs  While working in the condemned section of Luzira Maximum Security Proson, McLean observed that groups of condemned prisoners, male and female, had formed choirs to sing at Sunday services, but had also been singing anti-death penalty songs. McLean mentioned to the British volunteer Martyn Ryan, that he would like to record these songs. Martyn Ryan and his son Ben Ryan gathered up a group of volunteers in the UK and the team headed to Uganda in December 2007. They spent several days in the prison, recording songs by three separate choirs. Upon return to the UK, the volunteers mixed and produced an album, Freedom Cry. APP used the album to raise awareness of the ongoing constitutional challenge against Uganda's death penalty.  Awards  APP and McLean have won several high-profile awards. * In 2006, McLean was named the Charity Times Volunteer of the Year in the UK Charity Awards. The award was presented to McLean by Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. * In June 2007, McLean was named Alumnus of the Year by the University of Nottingham and the first Alumni Laureate at an alumni awards ceremony. * In September 2007, McLean was awarded the Real World Graduate of the Year award. Two months later, in November 2007, McLean was not only presented with the Beacon Prize for Young Philanthropist 2007, in recognition of his work, he was also named the Beacon Prize Overall winner. The honour came with a cheque for ¬£30,000 for APP. * In September 2008, APP was a finalist in the \\"Best New Charity\\" category of the Charitytimes UK Charity Awards. *In 2018, APP was a recipient of the Google Impact Challenge Award (Kenya).

The film played the festival circuit in 2006 and in 2007 received the audience award at the Deep Focus Film Festival in Columbus, Ohio.Columbus Alive! It was signed by Indican Pictures for theatrical, DVD, and TV release. The film was released on DVD on November 11, 2008. In January 2009 the film was nominated for an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Documentary. Overview Dare Not Walk Alone is about the civil rights movement and its aftermath in St. Augustine, Florida, the site of prolonged interracial tension and protests by the NAACP and the SCLC.Martin Luther King, Jr., Peter J. Ling, 2002, Routledge The most notable protests, including the Monson Motor Lodge swimming pool integration immediately preceded, and arguably precipitated, the signing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Background [Dare Not Walk Alone was conceived in 2003 by artist Jeremy Dean, who was then living and working in the Florida tourist town of St. Augustine, \\"America's oldest city.\\" When Dean volunteered to help restore the stained glass windows in an historically black church he learned of the events of 1964, the protests, the beatings, and the brilliant campaign of civil disobedience that led to the passage of the first civil rights act. While Dean felt honored working to preserve a place where Dr. King had once stood side-by-side with Jackie Robinson to rally supporters, he was stunned that he had never heard of these events before, so he set about researching them. He uncovered archive footage that had never been aired. He sat down with the people who were there, who put their lives on the line in the fight for equality and freedom from segregation. Waiting tables to finance the project, Dean created the first cut of the film in 2005 and in 2006 the first public screening of Dare Not Walk Alone took place at the historically black Ritz Theatre (Jacksonville), Florida in an event attended by Florida State Senator Anthony C. Hill. Within days, Senator Hill had organized a summit of civic leaders to address housing conditions in St. Augustine's African American community. He later introduced legislation to expunge the criminal records of all persons arrested for peacefully protesting segregation in Florida. Release and reviews By the end of 2007 the film had been signed for non-theatrical release by THINKFilm and in April 2008 the film began its theatrical release in Los Angeles with Hollywood-based distributor, Indican Pictures. When Dare Not Walk Alone made its theatrical debut in Los Angeles, Sara Schieron of Boxoffice Magazine declared it \\"has the potential to do real good in the world\\" and Eric Monder of Film Journal International noted, \\"The racial politics of the current presidential election make this film all the more significant.\\"Film Journal International Dare Not Walk Alone has been screened at universities such as Notre Dame and a number of historically black colleges and universities. The film was released on DVD in October 2008. Awards In 2007, Dare Not Walk Alone won the Audience Award at the Deep Focus Film Festival in Columbus, Ohio.

The play takes its title from an FBI code name for Monroe.People (magazine) (October 19, 1992) Lorenzo Carcaterra, Carol Peace, Jill Rachlin, Ralph Novak, Eric Levin. Section: Picks & Pans. Page 36. (writing, \\" The uninitiated -- for whom the line between fact and fiction will be all but blurred -- may simply tire of repetitive accounts of Marilyn popping pills and the FBI's bugging every room that Strawhead (Monroe's code name) visited.\\") According to Mailer, Strawhead represents \\"(Marilyn's) ironic, whimsical, tortured way of thinking.\\" Mailer sees the fictional Monroe character in the play as \\"having an immensely dialectical mind; no sooner does she have a thought, than she comes on its opposite. That's the way life presents itself to her - in contrasts and sudden shifts.\\" In January 1981, Hannum and Hunter were listed as the producers of the play and O'Horgan was listed as the director. At that time, Mailer had hoped that the play would open on Broadway in the spring 1981 or the fall 1981, but had not yet cast the Monroe character. In addition, Hannum still was working on the play construction and Mailer was working on the play dialogue from his writing desk in Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn.Time (magazine) (January 5, 1987) Most of '86, Section: Show Business; Page 74. To move the script along, Mailer presented the beginnings of Strawhead for critique to the Actors Studio Playwright And Directors Unit, an exclusive group to which Mailer belonged.Greer, Bonnie. (November 12, 2007) The Independent Farewell to a feisty, fearless keeper of the flame. Section: Comment; Page 36. The early draft had a clich√©d Monroe giving a blowjob to the Mailer-interviewer character. In response to former Marilyn Monroe roommate and Academy Award winning actress Shelley Winters blasting Mailer's effort, Mailer rewrote the part to be a burly Maileresque feminist who burst into the play from the audience. Production With the script finished, Mailer and the others set out to find the lead actress for the play. In October 1982, Mailer was attending a Park Avenue dinner party given by Claus von B√ºlow, who at that time was on trial for the attempted murder of von B√ºlow's wife, Sunny, and had been out of jail only two days on US$1 million bail.Writer, Larry. (September 2, 2006) Australian Magazine (News Limited pubs.) Dream Dates - The food Issue 2006. Section: Magazine 1; Page 37. (Tagline: \\"Kate Fitzpatrick and other well-known Australians tell Larry Writer about their most memorable dinner companions.\\") Also attending the party was Australian-based theatre actress Kate Fitzpatrick. Fitzpatrick was introduce to Mailer and spoke with Mailer during dinner after Mailer swapped the place cards to seat Fitzpatrick beside him. After deciding that Fitzpatrick was perfect to play Marilyn Monroe in Strawhead, Mailer, Hunter, and Hannum met with Fitzpatrick to give her the script.The Canberra Times (April 11, 2004) A few good stories and some. Fitzpatrick turned down the part, since she already was committed to playing Marilyn Monroe in Terry Johnson's 1982 play, Insignificance. The producers made additional efforts to find a noted actor to play the lead role. Prior to 1983, Mailer, Hunter, and Hannum also courted American actress Susan Sarandon to play the Marilyn Monroe character. Sarandon declined the lead role with the query, \\"Why should I perpetuate someone else's legend when I should be creating my own?\\" On March 7, 1983, the American Repertory Theatre at Mailer's alma mater Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, presented a staged reading of Strawhead.McKinnon, George. (February 27, 1983) The Boston Globe Marquee Dancin' in the street!' to reopen as cabaret. Section: Arts/Films. The presentation was part of the theaters noted Monday night series at the Loeb Drama Center. ART actor Karen MacDonald played the lead role. At this point, the play was an unproduced spec script, Mailer thought the play needed trimming, and there were no immediate plans to produce Strawhead. In June 1983, it was announced that Strawhead would be produced by Marshall Oglesby at Provincetown Playhouse in Manhattan.Kelly, Kevin.

In late August 1983, Strawhead was presented at Provincetown Playhouse. In November 1985, Mailer brought his play to the Actors Studio, an Off Broadway theater and school that gained worldwide recognition under the leadership of Lee Strasberg. The scenes presented were workshop scenesKing, Larry L.; Holland, Richard. (October 1999) A Writer's Life in Letters, Or, Reflections in a Bloodshot Eye. Page 296. Publisher: Texas Christian University Press and Mailer put himself in position of director of the two-act production. In addition to the cast including Robert Heller, Mickey Knox and Patrick Sullivan, Mailer added his wife Norris Church to the cast. There was no admission charge to the workshop. Debut and aftermath In January 1986, Strawhead was debuted in full at the Actors Studio, with actor and playwright John Jiler playing Mr. Charles.Jiler, John. (1995) Avenue X: The a Capella Musical. Page i. Publisher: Samuel French, Inc. . American playwright and critic Bonnie Greer, who shared a close relationship to Mailer and reviewed an initial version of the play, stated that what Mailer put on stage ultimately was not Monroe. Rather, the play was more about \\"chronicling all Mailer's life as The Great, White, Male Heterosexual, \\"Big Daddy\\", \\"The Man.\\"\\" In April 1986, it was first reported that Mailer's daughter Kate Mailer was added to the cast in the lead role. The choice was in interesting one since the play characterizes a fictional interaction between Monroe and Mailer and an early draft had a clich√©d Monroe giving a blowjob to the Mailer-interviewer character. In explaining Mailer's choice of casting his 23-year-old, unknown actress daughter in his play, Mailer stated, \\"She was the best prep-school actress I'd ever seen.\\" To bring publicity to the play and to sell the Vanity Fair magazine, Kate Mailer appeared on the April 1986 Vanity Fair cover as the Marilyn Monroe character in Strawhead. In October 1987, the New York Times describe Kate Mailer's portrayal of Monroe as teenage punk rocker who is \\"less identified with her role.\\"Klein, Alvin.

In her 2005 book The Many Lives of Marilyn Monroe, author Sarah Churchwell notes that Strawhead was a commercial failure. In April 2008, Harvard University received the papers of the co-author of the play, Richard G. Hannum,houghtonmodern. (April 24, 2008) Houghton Library Mailer at Harvard.

Included with those papers were correspondence with Mailer and drafts and final script for Strawhead. The drafts and final script evidence the literary techniques used in Strawhead and Mailer's efforts to continually improve his own writing for Strawhead and that of Hannums. Importantly, they convey research and teaching about how the style and substance of Strawhead was developed through layers of revision.

Its ruling dynasty was related to the main ruling dynasty of Munster known as the E√≥ganachta. Its ruling branch was called the E√≥ganacht Locha L√©in or Ui Chairpri L√∫achra. Their center was around Killarney, County Kerry at Loch L√©in. The name Iarluachair means west of the Sliabh Luachra mountains. The dynasty was established in the 5th century with the kingdom becoming semi-independent of the Munster kings at Cashel in the 6th century. They ruled over smaller kingdoms in west Munster such as the Ciarraige Luachra, Corcu Duibne and Corcu Lo√≠gde and at the height of their power may have ruled over areas of west Thomond including the Corcu Baiscinn and Corco Mruad and perhaps even had some sovereignty over the U√≠ Fidgenti of County Limerick and the E√≥ganacht Raithlind of County Cork. Their power was broken in the late 8th and early 9th centuries. The transference of the overlordship of the Ciarraige Luachra to direct Cashel control in the reign of Feidlimid mac Cremthanin (died 846) signified this. The last time the title King of Iarmuman was used in the Annals of Innisfallen was 791 and in the Annals of Ulster 833. The dynasty then begins to use the title king of Loch L√©in.

The codex is currently kept in the Great Lavra monastery (B' 52) on the Athos peninsula.  Description  The codex originally contained the entire New Testament except for the Book of Revelation, with lacunae at both the beginning and end.

Text  The Greek text of this codex is described as representative of the Byzantine text-type, but with a large portion of the Alexandrian, as well as some Western readings. Despite being unusually mixed text, Von Soden lists it as generally Alexandrian because the Gospel of Mark and the General epistles are in the Alexandrian text-type.Codex Sangallensis 48 also represents the Alexandrian text-type in the Gospel of Mark, and the Byzantine text-type in rest of the Gospels. In Gospel of Luke and John the Byzantine element is predominate, but with larger proportion of Alexandrian readings than in Codex Sangallensis 48. The Byzantine element is predominant in the Acts and the Pauline epistles The text of the General epistles appeared to be the same type found in Codex Alexandrinus, 33, 81, and 436.

History  The manuscript was first seen by C. R. Gregory on August 26, 1886. He described it as the first of its kind. In 1892 it had not examined by J. Rendel Harris, who was inspecting the Septuaginta manuscripts. Von Goltz and Wobbermin had collated text of Acts, General epistles, and Pauline epistles for Hermann von Soden. The codex was examined by Kirsopp Lake in 1899, who thoroughly examined the Gospel of Mark and collated the text of the Gospel of Luke and John. He did not examine the text of Acts and the Epistles because, according to Soden's opinion, their text was ordinary. In 1903, Lake published the text of the Gospel of Mark 9:5-16:20, and a collation of the Gospels of Luke, John, and Epistle to the Colossians in Studia Biblica et Ecclesiastica.K.

His writing career started in 1975 and ranged through at least 2010. Two of his six books won Lambda Literary Awards.  Life  Miller was born in Kingston, New York in 1945 and graduated from Kingston High School and Brown University. He was the news editor of the Gay Community News, the first weekly gay and lesbian newspaper in the United States, from 1975 to 1978, and also served as the paper's features and managing editor. He worked as a staff writer at the Boston Phoenix in the early 1980s. Writing Miller's most acclaimed book, In Search of Gay America, published in 1989, was the first book to examine gay and lesbian life outside the large metropolitan areas. Miller's subjects include the openly gay mayor of a small Missouri town, gay dairy farmers in Minnesota, a lesbian coal miner in West Virginia, and gay Native Americans in South Dakota. The book won a Lambda Literary Award in 1991 and was honored by the American Library Association. His second book, the ambitious Out in the World (1992), looked at gay and lesbian life in twelve countries around the world, including South Africa, Egypt, Thailand, Japan, Australia, and Denmark. His next book, Out of the Past, was an international survey of LGBT history beginning in 1869 which was the first time the word \\"homosexuality\\" appeared in print. First published in 1995, the book ranged in scope from the story of Plains Indians to the Nazi persecution of homosexuals to America in the age of AIDS. A revised, updated version appeared in 2006. His interest in gay history led him to write Sex-Crime Panic, an investigative account of the round-up and incarceration of 20 gay men in Sioux City, Iowa, during the McCarthy period. The round-up followed the brutal, unsolved murders of two small children. Although the men were never linked to the crimes in any way, they were labeled as \\"sexual psychopaths\\" and incarcerated in a locked ward of a state mental hospital until they were deemed \\"cured.\\" Sex-Crime Panic received a Lambda Literary Award in 2002, as well as the Randy Shilts Award for Gay Nonfiction from the Publishing Triangle. The story was almost completely unknown until Miller discovered it, tracking down participants and victims in detective-like fashion. In a departure, Miller's 2008 book, Kartchner Caverns was a nonfiction account of the discovery of stunning limestone caves in southern Arizona by two young men in 1974, and their 25-year quest to save them from environmental degradation. The caves have been preserved as Kartchner Caverns State Park. Kartchner Caverns was the winner of the 2009 Arizona Book Award for \\"best book,\\" awarded by the Arizona Publishing Association. It also received a Southwest Book Award for 2008 from the Border Regional Library Association. Miller's latest book, Banned in Boston is an account of the New England Watch and Ward Society's 90-year role as Boston's \\"moral guardian,\\" censoring books and plays and raiding places of gambling and prostitution. The powerful organization was funded by Boston's \\"Brahmin\\" elite. The book was published by Beacon Press in the fall of 2010. Miller's freelance articles have appeared in the Boston Globe Magazine, the Los Angeles Times, the Cleveland Plain-Dealer, CommonWealth Magazine, the Unitarian Universalist World, The Advocate, and Out. He teaches journalism and nonfiction writing at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts.

It was built for Princess Khatun (also known as Mamakhatun), the wife of Prince Vache I Vachutian who had purchased the district of Aragatzotn from the Zakarian brothers. The architect Vardapet Aghbayrik designed Tegher and the monasteries of Saghmosavank and Hovhannavank during the 13th century. The monastery survived intact during a time when Mongol invasions plagued the lands. Ruins of the 9th century village of Tegher (Old Tegher) sit a short distance walk from the monastery. Numerous foundations may be seen, along with the remains of a Tukh Manuk funerary chapel of the 5th century. Nearby is also the medieval to 19th century cemetery with some mausoleums and khachkars.  Architecture  Church = The church of Surb Astvatsatsin was built in 1213, and is constructed from dark gray basalt. It is a cruciform type plan with a chamber in each of the four corners and a semicircular apse at the end of the hall. A central tall round drum rests above with a tent style dome, supported by the corners of the square which is supported by columns below. The roof of the church is gabled. The structure is simply decorated except for the cornice moldings and accentuation of the arches in the main area. From the exterior, the building is rectangular with two wall niches and windows on the north, east, and south. = Gavit = The gavit adjacent to S. Astvatsatsin was finished in 1221. It is a large central-plan with four large columns. Intersecting arches support the square on which a dome with an oculus sits. Situated towards the front of the gavit at either corner, are two second-story rooms where students of the monastery once lived and were able to escape persecution from potential invading forces. Above these rooms are towers that are similar in construction to the main dome and drum of the church. On one of the columns of the gavit is an inscription that gives credit to the architect Vardapet Aghbayrik for designing S. Astvatsatsin and its gavit. In this same structure are numerous graves, one of which is the noble Princess Khatun and another is her husband Prince Vatcheh Vatchutian. Just outside the gavit, upon the front fa√ßade above the portal are a grouping of cross designs carved into the stone. Each is a memorial to a wealthy donor who supported the construction of the monastery, and is thus given \\"free passage\\" to heaven.

While there, he met his future wife Donya Fein. Orlinsky then completed a year of post-doctoral work at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Upon his return to the United States, he started working at the Baltimore Hebrew Teachers College (1936-1944). During this time he also studied at Johns Hopkins University with William F. Albright. Because of World War II, Albright was unable to secure the necessary funds for Orlinsky to become a permanent member of the faculty at Hopkins. Instead, Orlinsky, with the help of Albright, was able to secure a post with the Jewish Institute of Religion in 1943 (now merged with the Hebrew Union College) and it is here that Orlinsky spent the rest of his career. Orlinsky married Donya Fein in 1934 and they had two sons, Walter (Velvel) and Seymour (Zeke).Harry Meyer Orlinsky Papers at ead.ohiolink.edu Orlinsky died on Saturday 21 March 1992 at North Oaks Retirement Community in Owings Mills, MD. He was 84 years old.Dr_ Harry Orlinsky, 84, Professor Specializing in Biblical Literature - The New York Times by Wolfgang Saxon, 24 March 1992 Work as a translator Perhaps the greatest result of Orlinsky‚Äôs work on Torah translation was the creation of a gender-free translation of the Bible. Since the translator must interpret and explain the text, it behooves him (or her) to understand why certain words were used. If a language has a preference for masculine pronouns, is that because the reference is really to males, or does it have to do with the way a language functions? A similar example from modern times is the use of \\"guys\\" to refer to a group of people in general, regardless of gender. If the rest of the text did not use a masculine pronoun but rather used a more gender-neutral term such as \\"one,\\" then Orlinsky felt it was safe to say that the translator can use that term as well for the masculine pronouns within a given text.Hancock, Elise. \\"Male-Oriented Language in New Bible Translations.\\" Johns Hopkins Magazine, March (1978): 47-48 Orlinsky's work earned him the position as a key translator on not one but two new Bible translations. Starting 1952, he helped the Protestant National Council with their Revised Standard Version (RSV) of the Bible and then again with the New Revised Standard Version (1989). Walter Harrelson, the vice-chairman of the 1989 translation committee, said that Orlinsky was instrumental in the translation. He helped to keep the committee on track in using the older Massoretic text rather than the easier-to-translate Septuagint, which is a Greek translation. Harrelson recalls Orlinsky's constant reminder, \\"We‚Äôre translating Hebrew Scriptures. We're not translating from the Greek Hebrew Scriptures.\\"Briggs, David. \\"Bible Scholar Defended Integrity of Text.\\" The Associated Press Following the success of the RSV in 1952, Orlinsky turned his attention to a new translation of the Bible for Jews. He urged the Jewish Publication Society of America (JPS) to take up the task, since it was they who were responsible for the 1917 version still in use at the time. Orlinsky became the editor-in-chief for the Torah, which was published in 1962. He was also instrumental in helping to get The Prophets (1978) and The Writings (1982) published as well. Orlinsky helped move the translation of the Bible away from the literalism of the King James Version to the exegesis that was the hallmark of JPS‚Äôs 1917 translation and Orlinsky‚Äôs translation work. Mr. Green Affair In 1954, the Israeli government sought to authenticate four Dead Sea Scrolls being sold in New York City. The Metropolitan of the Syrian Monastery of St. Mark in Jerusalem ran a small ad in The Wall Street Journal, which was then brought to the attention of the Israeli Consulate in New York. The scrolls themselves had been at the center of a negotiation between the Metropolitan and Professor Eleazar Lippe Sukenik, the founder of the Hebrew University Department of Archaeology, which had been founded following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Unfortunately, since the newly founded State of Israel was unable to fund the purchase of the scrolls in 1948, the Metropolitan then moved the scrolls to the United States and deposited them in the Trust Company of New Jersey in Jersey City. It was at this point that the existence of the scrolls came to the attention of Yigael Yadin, from the office of the Consul- General of Israel in New York. Yadin felt that these scrolls belonged to Israel and should be housed there. He was positive, though, that the Metropolitan would not willingly sell the scrolls to Israel. This meant that he had to find someone who was knowledgeable about the scrolls but was not directly connected to Israel. On July 1, 1954 at noon, Orlinsky received a phone call from Yadin and was summoned Israeli Consulate. Once there, Orlinsky was ushered into the presence of Mr. Harman, the Israeli Consul-General, and Mr. Yadin. They then revealed that the reason for the strange summons was that the Dead Sea Scrolls were currently sitting in the vaults of the Trust Company of New Jersey. Orlinsky was told to assume the name of Mr. Green and examine the scrolls for the Israeli Government. Orlinsky was instructed to take a taxi to the Lexington Avenue entrance of the Waldorf-Astoria hotel and make sure that he was not being followed. Once there, he would meet with Sydney M. Estridge. Each man had been given a code to identify the other. Once this had been accomplished, they would proceed together to a vault located in the basement and meet with a representative of the Metropolitan. Finally, he was to examine the scrolls, keep his speech to an absolute minimum, and respond to no other identification than Mr. Green. Following the authentication process, Orlinsky called an unlisted number and spoke the code \\"lechayim,\\" confirming the scrolls' authenticity. Later, at the Consulate, Orlinsky signed a statement confirming the same, and after he and his wife were sworn to secrecy.Orlinsky, Harry. \\"Focus on The Dead Sea Scrolls: The Mysterious Mr. Green.\\" Reform Judaism, Spring (1992): 46-48.

The firm announced positive financial results in 2013, after major successes with this oil field, which achieved record gross production in August 2013. A strong growth in revenues was also reported thanks to these successes in Nigeria, as well as in Russia. Investors were also boosted by the news that the firm had expanded its portfolio in a promising region of Papua New Guinea and Tanzania, with drilling to commence on new sites in these areas in 2014. In October 2013, Heritage Oil considerably expanded its exploration portfolio after it agreed to farm-in two licences onshore Papua New Guinea, an increasingly attractive area for oil exploration and a region in which the firm now has four licences. In November 2013, Heritage signed a joint venture agreement with Bayelsa Oil Company Limited, the state-owned oil company of the Bayelsa State government, to establish an indigenous Nigerian oil company called Petrobay Energy Limited. The deal positioned the company to become a significant contributor to the development of the Nigerian oil and gas industry as Bayelsa contains many of the largest crude oil and natural gas deposits in the country. The deal also opened up access to further oil ventures and opportunities in Nigeria. In February 2014, Heritage Oil's stock jumped the most it had in 18 months after a report on massive production increases at the firm's OML 30 well in Nigeria, as well as the successful conclusion of tax rebate negotiations in the country. The prospect of a dividend pay-out for investors also contributed considerably to the firm's share price rise. In June 2014, the company was acquired by a fund owned by the former chief executive of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund. Operations The company is the operator and holds 50% interests in two licences in the Albert Basin of the Western Rift Valley of Uganda. Recent exploration activity has focused on the eastern shores of Lake Albert, which straddles the border of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Kurdistan. The company is also active in Russia, Malta, Libya, Pakistan and Tanzania. Ownership In 2006 Micael Gulbenkian stepped down from his position as CEO and Chairman of Heritage Oil. He was replaced by Michael Hibberd, who was appointed as Chairman and Tony Buckingham, who was appointed as CEO. As of 31 December 2008, Tony Buckingham owned 33.1% of the company. In 2014, Heritage Oil was acquired for $1.6 billion by Energy Investment Global, a subsidiary of Al Mirqab Capital, a Qatari investment fund. Terms of the sale included Buckingham remaining as an advisor with a 20% holding for five years. In December 2017, Naeem-Atiq Sadiq was appointed as CEO of Heritage Oil.

Helder also played the keyboard and flute. Writing their own music, the band also included Guy Wendon, Chris Woodman, Mathew Dermody and Steve Lott. Creamy Jobe were selected to play for the BBC Music Live Week in 2000, which saw them tour music venues around the Swansea area and culminated in a performance on the BBC stage in Singleton Park, Swansea on 20 May 2000. This coincided with their only album release - Creamy Jobe Greatest Hits II - Voices on Vinyl. Helder appeared with Creamy Jobe on 23 August 2014 in a reunion to celebrate 15 years since the original formation of the band. Karnataka From 2001 to 2004, Helder was a member of the Welsh band Karnataka, along with Jonathan Edwards and two other members of Panic Room (Paul Davies and Gavin John Griffiths). When the band split in 2004, these four continued to work together, which is where the ideas and music for Panic Room were born. Karnataka bassist Ian Jones later reformed the band without any of the other former members. Solo album Helder released her solo EP The Contact in November 2004, which received positive reviews and secured airplay on BBC Radio 2, with DJ Bob Harris declaring: \\"this is very dramatic music\\".

Panic Room In 2006 Helder began working with a group of musicians, including Paul Davies, Jonathan Edwards, and Gavin Griffiths, all of whom she had performed with previously in Karnataka, to start a new band project. This band evolved to become Panic Room. In 2008 they released their debut album Visionary Position, and in 2010 the follow-up album Satellite was released. The multi-award-winning album also secured Helder her first award as an individual, for her voice: she was voted Best Female Vocalist in the 2010 Classic Rock Presents Prog magazine Reader's Poll, and has gone on to win the award for an unprecedented second year running. Panic Room toured extensively to promote the Satellite album, and in 2011 played their largest run of dates yet, performing over 20 shows in 6 weeks in the UK alone. At the beginning of 2012 the band signed a record deal with Esoteric Antenna and Cherry Red Records, for their next album S K I N. This would be Panic Room's first album released on a label, having been purely independent up until this point. The first two albums and Incarnate from 2014 were released on the band's own label Firefly Music, of which Helder is a business partner.

In early 2008, there were many shuffles to the line-up of the band, and as both Gordon and keyboardist Chris Johnson left to pursue other projects, Helder was invited to join them to play keyboards, acoustic guitar, flute and backing vocals. Helder recorded vocals and flute with Mostly Autumn on the 2008 album Glass Shadows, and has appeared on every album since. * She has supported Steve Hackett in 2013 on his Genesis Revisited II tour. * She has also performed guest vocals on the Icon project by John Wetton and Geoff Downes, the dance album Electronica by Geoff Downes, and albums by other artists including Dave Kilminster, Parade (now Halo Blind) and The SKYS.

The town is administratively subdivided into two Union Councils, including Hadali-Ii.Local Government Elections - Government of Pakistan Location of Hadali - Falling Rain Genomics History Khushab District was a forested agricultural region during the Indus Valley Civilization. The Vedic period was characterized by Indo-Aryan culture that invaded from Central Asia and settled in the Punjab region. The Kambojas, Daradas, Kaikayas, Madras, Pauravas, Yaudheyas, Malavas, and Kurus invaded, settled and ruled the ancient Punjab region. After overrunning the Achaemenid Empire in 331 BCE, Alexander the Great marched into the Punjab region with an army of 50,000. The Khushab region was ruled by Maurya Empire, Indo-Greek kingdom, Kushan Empire, Gupta Empire, White Huns, Kushano-Hephthalites and Shahi kingdoms. In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin. In 1005, he conquered the Shahis in Kabul in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of the Punjab region. The Delhi Sultanate and, later, the Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikh Empire invaded and occupied the Khushab District. During the period of British rule, Khushab district increased in population and importance. The predominantly Muslim population of Khushab District supported the Muslim League and Pakistan movement. After independence in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslim refugees, Rajputs, from India settled in the Hadali after Partition of India and Pakistan in 1947.

MEGHA-TROPIQUES: water cycle in the tropical atmosphere in the context of climate change.(Access date 06-21-2008) A collaborative effort between Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and French Centre National d‚ÄôEtudes Spatiales (CNES), Megha-Tropiques was successfully deployed into orbit by a PSLV rocket in October 2011. Megha-Tropiques was initially scrapped in 2003, but later revived in 2004 after India increased its contribution and overall costs were lowered.India and France Resurrect, Redesign Megha-Tropiques Mission , PETER B. de SELDING And K.S. JAYARAMAN. 24 February 2004ISRO and French Space Agency, CNES, Sign MOU on Megha-Tropiques Satellite Mission November 12, 2004 With the progress made by GEWEX (Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment), Megha-Tropiques is designed to understand tropical meteorological and climatic processes, by obtaining reliable statistics on the water and energy budget of the tropical atmosphere. Megha-Tropiques complements other data in the current regional monsoon projects such as MAHASRI and the completed GAME project. Megha-Tropiques also seeks to describe the evolution of major tropical weather systems. The focus will be the repetitive measurement of the tropics. Design Megha-Tropiques provides instruments that allow simultaneously observation of 3 interrelated components of the atmospheric engine: water vapor, condensed water (clouds and precipitations), and radiative fluxes, facilitating the repetitive sampling of the inter-tropical zone over long periods of time. Its microwave radiometer, Multi-frequency Microwave Scanning Radiometer (MADRAS), complements the radiometers of the other elements of the Global Precipitation Measurement mission. Payload Instruments fulfill a role to other on geostationary satellites. In this, microwave instruments are essential. * Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric Structures (MADRAS) is a microwave imager, with conical scanning (incidence angle 56¬∞), close from the SSM/I and TMI concepts. The main aim of the mission being the study of cloud systems, a frequency has been added (150 GHz) in order to study the high level ice clouds associated with the convective systems, and to serve as a window channel relative to the sounding instrument at 183 GHz. * Sounder for Probing Vertical Profiles of Humidity (SAPHIR) is a sounding instrument with 6 channels near the absorption band of water vapor at 183 GHz. These channels provide relatively narrow weighting functions from the surface to about 10 km, allowing retrieving water vapor profiles in the cloud free troposphere. The scanning is cross-track, up to an incidence angle of 50¬∞. The resolution at nadir is of 10 km. * Scanner for Radiation Budget (ScaRaB) is a scanning radiative budget instrument, which has already been launched twice on Russian satellites. The basic measurements of ScaRaB are the radiances in two wide channels, a solar channel (0.2 - 4 ¬µm), and a total channel (0.2 - 200 ¬µm), allowing to derive longwave radiances. The resolution at nadir will be 40 km from an orbit at 870 km. The procedures of calibration and processing of the data in order to derive fluxes from the original radiances have been set up and tested by CNES and LMD. * Radio Occultation Sensor for Vertical Profiling of Temperature and Humidity (ROSA) procured from Italy for vertical profiling of temperature and humidity. Launch The Megha-Tropiques satellite was successfully placed in an 867 km orbit with an inclination of 20 degrees to the equator by the Indian Space Research Organisation through its Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C18) on October 12, 2011. The PSLV-C18 was launched at 11:00 am on October 12, 2011 from the first launch pad of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SHAR) located in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. The satellite was placed in orbit along with three micro satellites: the 10.9 kg SRMSAT built by the SRM University, Chennai, the 3 kg remote sensing satellite Jugnu from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur(IIT Kanpur) and the 28.7 kg VesselSat-1 of Luxembourg to locate ships on high seas.

The one species in this genus, Samburupithecus kiptalami, is known only from a maxilla fragment dated to discovered in 1982 and formally described by . The type specimen KNM-SH 8531 was discovered by the Joint Japan-Kenya Expedition at the SH22 fossil site in the Samburu District, a locality where several other researchers found no ape fossils. Samburupithecus lived during the so-called \\"African ape gap\\" , a period from which very few hominoid fossils have been found in Africa until relatively recently. This apparent gap, however, is now populated by a diversity of apes such as Nakalipithecus, Chororapithecus abyssinicus, Otavipithecus, and Nacholapithecus. Characteristics Jaw fragment Samburupithecus was approximately and was most likely a frugivorous terrestrial quadruped. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions indicate that Samburupithecus most likely lived in a wooded habitat surrounded by savannah. Defining cranial traits of this genus include low, broad zygomatics, straight alveolar process and large maxillary sinus. Defining dental traits include three-rooted premolars, thick enamel and bunodont cusps. The teeth in the Samburupithecus type maxilla are comparable in size to those of the type mandible of Nakalipithecus, roughly the size of a modern female gorilla. The upper premolars of both are elongated mesiodistally (along the row of teeth), but those of Samburupithecus have more inflated cusps that are positioned more centrally, so that occlusal foveae and basins (depressions at top of teeth) are very restricted. This suggests that Samburupithecus was strongly specialized compared to other Miocene and extant apes. Another distinguishing feature between the two is the higher relief of the dentine/enamel junction in Samburupithecus. These elongated teeth are unlike many other Miocene hominoids, linking Samburupithecus the taxon to gorillas, chimpanzees and hominins, but its relationships within this clade is at present unclear. Because of this mixture of primitive and derived traits in the KNM-SH 8531 specimen, it has been proposed that Samburupithecus lived before the gorilla-chimpanzee-hominin split and, therefore, that it is a common ancestor to these primates alongside Ouranopithecus.

On May 19, 2012, during rock throwing clashes after settlers, apparently from the nearby Yitzhar settlement, came to the village, a settler shot and wounded Fathi Assayara, a 24-year-old Palestinian.Israeli settler shoots at Palestinians while IDF soldiers stand by, By Gili Cohen, May. 20, 2012, Haaretz Five Palestinians were injured by the rock throwing. According to B'Tselem, IDF soldiers \\"didn't take any measures to stop the settlers from throwing stones, lighting fires, and firing live rounds at the Palestinians\\". B'Tselem published several videos of the incident.Beginning of 'Asira al-Qibliya event, 19.5.2012, B'Tselem Abraham Benjamin, spokesman for the Yitzhar settlement, said settlers were responding to series of fires set by \\"the Arabs from the town\\" and that \\"it can be plainly seen that the use of weapons by the IDF or the security team was warranted by a real danger to life\\". In mid-2013, the US government requested protection by the IDF for a USAID project that is building a water cistern Asira al-Qibliya. The project and its employees had been repeatedly attacked by settlers from Yitzhar. The settlers of Yitzhar would routinely claim that the villagers of Asira al- Qibliya provoked them. The Palestinian villagers were then, in 2012, given cameras to document the attacks, and the video evidence they provided (and published on YouTube and elsewhere) forced the IDF to act. The result was that the Yitzhar settlers attacked the IDF. By 2014, calls were mounting to classify these Israeli settlers as terrorist. The villagers of Asira al- Qibliya found it a case of \\"too little, too late.\\" One villager put it: \\"It is only words.

K. Lim is a low perennial plant found in dry fields and around gardens and cultivated grounds in Europe, North America, and in Argentina. C. nobile is, along with Matricaria chamomilla, an important source of the herbal product known as chamomile. Description Chamaemelum nobile has daisy-like white flowers and procumbent stems; the leaves are alternate, bipinnate, finely dissected, and downy to glabrous. The solitary, terminal flowerheads, rising above the ground, consist of prominent yellow disk flowers and silver-white ray flowers. The flowering time in the Northern Hemisphere is June and July, and its fragrance is sweet, crisp, fruity and herbaceous. Although the plant is often confused with German chamomile (M. chamomilla), its morphology, properties and chemical composition are markedly different. Etymology The word chamomile, and the genus name Chamaemelum come from the Greek œáŒ±ŒºŒ±ŒØŒºŒ∑ŒªŒøŒΩ (chamaimƒìlon), \\"earth- apple\\",Chamaimelon, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus from œáŒ±ŒºŒ±ŒØ (chamai), \\"on the ground\\" + ŒºŒÆŒªŒøŒΩ (mƒìlon), \\"apple\\", so-called because of the apple-like scent of the plant. (Note: The \\"ch-\\" spelling is used especially in science and pharmacology.). The plant obtained the name \\"nobile\\" (Latin, noble) because of its putative therapeutic properties, which were believed to be better than those of the German chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L.)European Medicines Agency (EMA) (2012). Assessment Report on Chamaemelum nobile (L.) All., flos. EMA, London.  History  Roman chamomile (C. nobile L.) is known as a medicinal plant from the middle ages. The European cultivation of the plant started in England in the 16th century. The plant was listed first in the pharmacopoeia of W√ºrtenberg as a carminative, painkiller, diuretic and digestive aid.Lukacs M. (1990) [The phytochemical investigation of Anthemis nobilis L.] PhD Thesis, Szent-Gy√∂rgyi Albert Medical University Szeged. Non-medicinal use The plant is used to flavor foods, in herbal teas, perfumes, and cosmetics. It is used to make a rinse for blonde hair, and is popular in aromatherapy; its practitioners believe it to be a calming agent to reduce stress and aid in sleep. It can also be used to create a fragrant chamomile lawn. A chamomile lawn needs light soil, adequate moisture, and sun in order to thrive. Each square meter contains 83-100 plants. The lawn is only suitable to light foot traffic or in places where mower access is difficult. Folk medicine In folk medicine, it may be applied directly to the skin to reduce pain and swelling, with several scientific studied giving credence to such purported analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. According to MedlinePlus It is not recommended to be taken orally in medicinal amounts during pregnancy as it is believed it may cause a miscarriage. There are no known interactions with other herbs and supplements or foods.

Cricket careerCricket Player= Anurag Thakur played a Ranji Trophy match against Jammu & Kashmir in November 2000 when he was the president of HPCA. He has played one match in first-class cricket representing Himachal Pradesh and leading the team as captain in a match against Jammu and Kashmir in the 2000/2001 season. Jammu and Kashmir won by 4 wickets. He picked himself for the match so as to fulfill the BCCI criterion (which requires state administrators to have at least one first-class match experience) for becoming a selector at the state level. After the match, he appointed himself as the chairman of selectors of HPCA Ranji trophy cricket team. He was involved in a legal struggle between the Himachal Pradesh State Government and the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association over the rights to the International Cricket Stadium at Dharamshala. = Cricket Administrator = He was the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) until Supreme Court of India sacked Anurag Thakur as president on 02/01/2017. Early on in his administrative tenure, he gained fame for possibly being the first cricketer to have made his first-class debut after taking over as the President of the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) in July 2000, at which time his father was the Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh. This debut was his one and only first-class cricket match. This experience in first-class cricket enabled his induction into the BCCI national junior selection committee, satisfying the condition that only first-class players could be national selectors. Thakur continued to rise up the ranks in cricketing administration bodies to the position of Secretary for BCCI. On 22 May 2016, Thakur became the president of BCCI, and in January 2017, he was removed from the post by the Supreme Court from the post of BCCI president for not complying with its orders and making false statements under oath before the Supreme Court.

The book presents a view of the foundations of mathematics and Meinongianism and has become a classic reference. It reported on developments by Giuseppe Peano, Mario Pieri, Richard Dedekind, Georg Cantor, and others. In 1905 Louis Couturat published a partial French translationLouis Couturat (1905) Les Principes des math√©matiques: avec un appendice sur la philosophie des math√©matiques de Kant. Republished 1965, Georg Olms that expanded the book's readership. In 1937 Russell prepared a new introduction saying, \\"Such interest as the book now possesses is historical, and consists in the fact that it represents a certain stage in the development of its subject.\\" Further editions were printed in 1938, 1951, 1996, and 2009. Contents The Principles of Mathematics consists of 59 chapters divided into seven parts: indefinables in mathematics, number, quantity, order, infinity and continuity, space, matter and motion. In chapter one, \\"Definition of Pure Mathematics\\", Russell asserts that : > The fact that all Mathematics is Symbolic Logic is one of the greatest > discoveries of our age; and when this fact has been established, the > remainder of the principles of mathematics consists in the analysis of > Symbolic Logic itself.Bertrand Russell, Principles of Mathematics (1903), > p.5 There is an anticipation of relativity physics in the final part as the last three chapters consider Newton's laws of motion, absolute and relative motion, and Hertz's dynamics. However, Russell rejects what he calls \\"the relational theory\\", and says on page 489 : :For us, since absolute space and time have been admitted, there is no need to avoid absolute motion, and indeed no possibility of doing so. In his review, G. H. Hardy says \\"Mr. Russell is a firm believer in absolute position in space and time, a view as much out of fashion nowadays that Chapter [58: Absolute and Relative Motion] will be read with peculiar interest.\\" Early reviews Reviews were prepared by G. E. Moore and Charles Sanders Peirce, but Moore's was never published and that of Peirce was brief and somewhat dismissive. He indicated that he thought it unoriginal, saying that the book \\"can hardly be called literature\\" and \\"Whoever wishes a convenient introduction to the remarkable researches into the logic of mathematics that have been made during the last sixty years [...] will do well to take up this book.\\" G. H. Hardy wrote a favorable reviewG. H. Hardy (18 September 1903) \\"The Philosophy of Mathematics\\", Times Literary Supplement #88 expecting the book to appeal more to philosophers than mathematicians. But he says : :[I]n spite of its five hundred pages the book is much too short. Many chapters dealing with important questions are compressed into five or six pages, and in some places, especially in the most avowedly controversial parts, the argument is almost too condensed to follow. And the philosopher who attempts to read the book will be especially puzzled by the constant presupposition of a whole philosophical system utterly unlike any of those usually accepted. In 1904 another review appeared in Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society (11(2):74‚Äì93) written by Edwin Bidwell Wilson. He says \\"The delicacy of the question is such that even the greatest mathematicians and philosophers of to-day have made what seem to be substantial slips of judgement and have shown on occasions an astounding ignorance of the essence of the problem which they were discussing. ... all too frequently it has been the result of a wholly unpardonable disregard of the work already accomplished by others.\\" Wilson recounts the developments of Peano that Russell reports, and takes the occasion to correct Henri Poincar√© who had ascribed them to David Hilbert. In praise of Russell, Wilson says \\"Surely the present work is a monument to patience, perseverance, and thoroughness.\\" (page 88) Second edition In 1938 the book was re-issued with a new preface by Russell. This preface was interpreted as a retreat from the realism of the first edition and a turn toward nominalist philosophy of symbolic logic. James Feibleman, an admirer of the book, thought Russell‚Äôs new preface went too far into nominalism so he wrote a rebuttal to this introduction.James Feibleman (1944) Reply to the Introduction of the Second Edition, pages 157 to 174 of The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell, P.A. Schilpp, editor, link from HathiTrust Feibleman says, \\"It is the first comprehensive treatise on symbolic logic to be written in English; and it gives to that system of logic a realistic interpretation.\\" Later reviews In 1959 Russell wrote My Philosophical Development, in which he recalled the impetus to write the Principles: :It was at the International Congress of Philosophy in Paris in the year 1900 that I became aware of the importance of logical reform for the philosophy of mathematics. ... I was impressed by the fact that, in every discussion, [Peano] showed more precision and more logical rigour than was shown by anybody else. ... It was [Peano's works] that gave the impetus to my own views on the principles of mathematics.Russell, My Philosophical Development, p. 65. Recalling the book after his later work, he provides this evaluation: :The Principles of Mathematics, which I finished on 23 May 1902, turned out to be a crude and rather immature draft of the subsequent work [Principia Mathematica], from which, however, it differed in containing controversy with other philosophies of mathematics.Russell, My Philosophical Development, p. 74. Such self-deprecation from the author after half a century of philosophical growth is understandable. On the other hand, Jules Vuillemin wrote in 1968: :The Principles inaugurated contemporary philosophy. Other works have won and lost the title. Such is not the case with this one. It is serious, and its wealth perseveres. Furthermore, in relation to it, in a deliberate fashion or not, it locates itself again today in the eyes of all those that believe that contemporary science has modified our representation of the universe and through this representation, our relation to ourselves and to others.Jules Vuillemin (1968) Le√ßons sur la primi√®re philosophie de Russell, page 333, Paris: Colin When W. V. O. Quine penned his autobiography, he wrote:W. V. O. Quine (1985) The Time of My Life, page 59, MIT Press :Peano's symbolic notation took Russell by storm in 1900, but Russell‚Äôs Principles was still in unrelieved prose. I was inspired by its profundity [in 1928] and baffled by its frequent opacity. In part it was rough going because of the cumbersomeness of ordinary language as compared with the suppleness of a notation especially devised for these intricate themes. Rereading it years later, I discovered that it had been rough going also because matters were unclear in Russell's own mind in those pioneer days. The Principles was an early expression of analytic philosophy and thus has come under close examination.Peter Hylton (1990) Russell, Idealism, and the Emergence of Analytic Philosophy, chapter 5: Russell‚Äôs Principles of Mathematics, pp 167 to 236, Clarendon Press, Peter Hylton wrote, \\"The book has an air of excitement and novelty to it ... The salient characteristic of Principles is ... the way in which the technical work is integrated into metaphysical argument.\\" Ivor Grattan-Guinness made an in-depth study of Principles. First he published Dear Russell ‚Äì Dear Jourdain (1977),Ivor Grattan-Guinness (1977) Dear Russell ‚Äì Dear Jourdain: a commentary on Russell‚Äôs logic, based on his correspondence with Philip Jourdain, Duckworth Overlook which included correspondence with Philip Jourdain who promulgated some of the book‚Äôs ideas. Then in 2000 Grattan-Guinness published The Search for Mathematical Roots 1870 ‚Äì 1940, which considered the author‚Äôs circumstances, the book‚Äôs composition and its shortcomings.Ivor Grattan-Guinness (2000) The Search for Mathematical Roots 1870‚Äì1940: Logics, Set Theories, and the Foundations of Mathematics from Cantor through Russell to G√∂del, Princeton University Press .

A prolific composer of madrigals, he was resident at the Gonzaga court of Mantua in the 1590s, where he was a close associate of Giaches de Wert, and a rival of his younger contemporary Claudio Monteverdi. Biography Ducal palace at Mantua, where Pallavicino was employed variously as singer, composer, and music director, from 1583 until 1601. He was born in Cremona in either 1550 or 1551. While little is known about his early life, a mid-17th century document by Cremonese writer Giuseppe Bresciani indicates he served as an organist at several churches in the Cremona region while young, and it is possible he studied with Marc' Antonio Ingegneri, the same man who was the teacher of Monteverdi. His older brother Germano was also a prominent local organist.Monteath, \\"Germano Pallavicino\\", Grove online The Gonzaga family employed Benedetto at Sabbioneta beginning in 1579 and probably lasting until 1581, first as a singer, and in 1583 he began service with the Gonzagas in Mantua, a musical center of immense importance in the last decades of the 16th century; he stayed there for the rest of his life. While there he associated with some of the most famous composers of the last two decades of the 16th century, people such as Giaches de Wert, Francesco Soriano, Giovanni Giacomo Gastoldi, Francesco Rovigo, Alessandro Striggio, and Claudio Monteverdi, over 15 years his junior. According to the music historian K. Bosi Monteath, his relationship with Monteverdi was one of considerable animosity, although he offers no direct evidence of this.Monteath, \\"Benedetto Pallavicino\\", Grove onlineEinstein, Vol II p. 602 A letter of 29 October 1583, preserved in the Biblioteca Comunale in Mantua, is the earliest surviving documentation of his service to the Gonzaga family. While in their service ‚Äì first for Guglielmo Gonzaga, and then for Vincenzo, when Guglielmo died in 1587 ‚Äì he made periodic trips to Venice in an official capacity, to examine singers at St. Mark's, and to supervise musical publications (since Venice was the center of music printing at the time, and other cities such as Mantua depended on their services). In 1589, likely dissatisfied at his low pay at the Gonzaga court, Pallavicino began seeking other employment, such as the position of maestro di cappella at Verona Cathedral; he was, however, unsuccessful, as the position went to Giammateo Asola. In 1596, on the death of renowned composer Giaches de Wert, he was finally appointed to the premier musical position in the Gonzaga establishment, the maestro della musica, a position he was to retain until his own death in 1601, at which time it was given to Claudio Monteverdi, his most bitter rival. The preference of Pallavicino over Monteverdi for the post is unsurprising, considering that Monteverdi at the time had none of Pallavicino's popularity, and was only in his twenties, while Pallavicino was in his mid-forties; and Pallavicino had served the Gonzaga family for a long time.Arnold, Monteverdi, p. 11. That considerable animosity existed between the two composers has been inferred from contemporary writings, particularly the exchange of letters following Giovanni Artusi's famous attacks on Monteverdi's style in 1600 and 1603, as well as the habit both men had of taking madrigals written by the other, and \\"improving\\" them. In his later years, for which documentation is scant, he received support from the Accademia Filarmonica of Verona, an organization founded about sixty years before, with whom many other earlier composers had been associated, including prominent musicians such as Jan Nasco, Vincenzo Ruffo and Marc' Antonio Ingegneri, the teacher of Monteverdi. In September 1601 there is a note in the Mantuan archives indicating that Pallavicino pleaded for a debt to be forgiven, as he had children to support, and many other debts, and he died in the next month. His death certificate lists \\"fever\\" as the cause, and his age at death as 50, thus establishing his birth year as either 1550 or 1551. According to Alfred Einstein, he spent the last years of his life as a monk of the Camaldolese order of Benedictines.Einstein, Vol II p. 834 Benedetto Pallavicino had a son named Bernardino; the similarity of their names, and apparent continuation of Benedetto's publishing activities, caused many musicologists to believe he lived well into the 17th century, until the discovery of his death notice, which gave a precise date. His son was a monk of the Camaldolese order of San Marco, and published several volumes of his father's work posthumously, including his seventh and eighth book of madrigals. Music and influence Pallavicino was famous mainly for his secular music, in particular his madrigals, of which he wrote ten books, the last two of which were published posthumously by his son. In addition to his madrigals, he also left a small body of sacred vocal works. Either he wrote no solely instrumental music, or none has survived. =Madrigals= His madrigals use from four to six voices, and show the influence of several of the prominent stylistic trends of the time. There is a gradual progression from an early dense imitative and polyphonic style, to one making use of most of the trends current at Mantua and Ferrara, including the seconda pratica style of declamatory writing, which was one of the musical characteristics defining the beginning of the Baroque era. Unlike Monteverdi, for whom it was a defining characteristic of his polyphonic madrigals, Pallavicino generally ignored the possibilities for dramatic characterization inherent in the texts he set, especially in his earlier books. This was the period in which the precursors of opera were being written, and one of the prominent madrigalian trends was to take dialogue, monologue, or straight narrative texts and set them with appropriate characterization. In this respect he was a conservative. Yet he also experimented with unprepared dissonance in precisely the way which Artusi so fiercely criticized Monteverdi ‚Äì and remained on the list of composers which that famous reactionary critic considered to be exemplars of correct polyphonic practice ‚Äì but most likely because Artusi had never heard his last books of madrigals.Einstein, Vol. II p. 852-3 The ten books of madrigals show a gradual absorption of the styles of other composers in the orbit of the courts of Mantua and Ferrara, particularly Wert. In the first book, Pallavicino wrote mostly in an imitative style similar to that of previous generations of composers, and related to the polyphonic style of sacred music. By the fourth book, Pallavicino was experimenting with sudden and extreme contrasts of texture rhythm, devices later taken to an extreme in the works of Carlo Gesualdo, but seen earlier in Wert. The influence of Luzzasco Luzzaschi is also evident in this book, particularly in the virtuosic writing for high female voices, including ornamentation and voice exchange techniques reminiscent of the music being composed for the famous three singers, the Concerto delle donne, of Ferrara. It is in his sixth book of madrigals, published in 1600, the year traditionally (and arbitrarily) marking the end of the musical Renaissance, that his shift to the new style of the seconda pratica is most prominent. The madrigals, mostly based on texts by Giovanni Battista Guarini ‚Äì by far the favorite poet of madrigal composers of the time ‚Äì are written in a largely homophonic and declamatory style which is highly attentive to text accentuation and rhythm. It is also in this book that he uses some of the musical devices that were to make Monteverdi famous, such as the unprepared dissonance that so horrified Artusi, as well as previously forbidden melodic intervals such as diminished fourths; he also exploits cross relations for expressive effect. Curiously, he also frequently uses the interval of the falling sixth, a characteristic of Monteverdi's ‚Äì though which learned it from the other is uncertain.Arnold, 62-63 =Sacred music= In his sacred music, which consists of masses, motets, and psalm settings, Pallavicino shows the influence of the Venetians, with large, spatially separated choirs, and he often wrote music for relatively large forces. He published books of motets for 8, 12, and 16 independent voices. These compositions are mainly homophonic in texture, aiming more for effect through alternation of sonority than counterpoint, a characteristic of the Venetian polychoral style. His masses are for four to six voices, and in the conservative polyphonic style of the High Renaissance; they use the parody technique, and some are based on motets by Lassus and Giaches de Wert. It is not known which churches he wrote his music for; the church where he worked, Santa Barbara, contains no mention of his compositions in their archives, and it has been suggested that he may have written them for other churches in Mantua, such as San Andrea and San Marco. =Influence and modern appraisal= Pallavicino's music was popular at the time, and printed and reprinted after his death, in both Venice and Antwerp; his popularity is attested by the numerous reprints and copies of his madrigals, especially in anthologies, in locations as far away as England. Indeed, he is second only to Marenzio in the manuscript Drexel 4302 containing 100 of his madrigals, and his music appears in at least 20 separate English sources. While Pallavicino was respected by most of his contemporaries, his achievement had been completely overshadowed by that of Monteverdi, at least until the last decades of the 20th century, during which the musical culture of cities such as Mantua and Ferrara has received considerable study, and Pallavicino's originality has again been appreciated.

It was established in 1994 and provides office, rehearsal, tuition and performance space for a wide range of music groups. The centre is adjacent to the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament and now consists of a group of four heritage buildings formerly the convent of the Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions and Sacred Heart College, a Catholic secondary school for girls founded in 1881 which was amalgamated with Xavier College, a neighbouring Catholic boys' school to form Catholic Cathedral College in 1987. The chapel, built in 1907, by Joseph Munnings, Samuel Hurst Seager and Cecil Wood, is the primary performance space. It is one of the only examples of Byzantine revival architecture in the Southern Hemisphere. The three-storey main convent building, designed in 1882 by Francis Petre is the oldest building in the complex. It was opened in 1894. The Portery was added in 1902 to extend the convent. It was restored with the girls‚Äô boarding hostel for Sacred Heart College, constructed in 1930. Both buildings became part of the music centre in 2004 The buildings were badly damaged in the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Two of the centre's four buildings sustained significant earthquake damage. The three-storey main building has been demolished. It is hoped that the music centre will reopen on the existing site. The Christchurch School of Music, one of the tenants of the Music Centre, had about 800 students attending weekly classes taught by 80 teachers at the Music Centre and the adjacent Catholic Cathedral College.

Career Kazushi Miyamoto will forever have the distinction of being the first post-split graduate of the All Japan Pro Wrestling dojo. While in the Dojo Miyamoto was trained by Hiroshi Hase, Johnny Smith, and his mentor Toshiaki Kawada. Miyamoto was so serious about wrestling for All Japan, he originally asked Giant Baba in 1996, but was denied due to his young age. After completing training in the Dojo, Miyamoto debuted on August 19, 2001 against Hiroshi Hase. A Jr. Heavyweight when he debuted, for the remainder of the year he opened cards and wrestled different veterans to help him hone his craft. He started 2002 off by pickingup his first pinfall victory in a tag team match, and a couple days later he had his first singles victory over Yasu Urano. For the rest of 2002 he continued wrestling towards the beginning of the card, waiting for his chance to elevate to a more meaningful role. In 2003, Miyamoto would finally get that chance. In the \\"Royal Road Initiation 7 Match 'Intense' Series\\", Miyamoto would face off against Genichiro Tenryu on 2/16/03. Also in February 2003 he formed a tag team with Tomoaki Honma called \\"Turmeric Storm\\". As Turmeric Storm they would be staples of the mid-card, picking up victories over teams such as Shigeo Okumura and Taichi Ishikari, Hideki Hosaka and Ryuji Hijikata, Gran Naniwa and Jun Kasai, and many others. On February 11, 2004 they would challenge Great Kosuke and Shiryu for the All Asia Tag Team Championship, but they would lose when Shiryu pinned Miyamoto. Soon after, Miyamoto would begin his excursion, traveling to America. Miyamoto would stay in America for over a year, wrestling for a variety of wrestling promotions. Wrestling both as himself and \\"The Great Kazushi\\" (a gimmick similar to The Great Muta), Miyamoto wrestled in Professional Championship Wrestling, USA Pro Wrestling, Border City Wrestling, River City Wrestling, and others. He also wrestled in TNA Wrestling debuting on TNA Impact! and would be featured there several times, including in a match against Triple X. On June 23, 2004 he appeared on PPV to team with NOSAWA to wrestle America's Most Wanted challenging for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. His last appearance for the company would be at Victory Road 04', where both he and NOSAWA competed in a X-Division Gaunlet, which was won by Hector Garza. Besides TNA, Miyamoto made two appearances in Ring of Honor. On July 23, he defeated Shawn Daivari and on July 24 he wrestled in a six man match with Trent Acid winning. Overall gain much experience as he had experienced wrestling in many different promotions and even won the River City Wrestling Heavyweight Championship in 2005. During the summer of 2005, Miyamoto would return to All Japan. On July 15, 2005 he wrestled Akira Raijin in his return match, winning in less than four minutes to show his growth. His return to All Japan would not last long, however, as on November 22, 2005 it was announced that Miyamoto was leaving All Japan for a new promotion called Kings Road. Originally Kings Road was rumored to have Toshiaki Kawada as their ace, but Kawada never appeared for the promotion. Defecting with Miyamoto included All Japan wrestler Shota Takanishi and Genichiro Tenryu. On the main event of the first Kings Road event, Miyamoto main evented against legend Genichiro Tenryu, with Tenryu picking up the victory. Miyamoto continued being the ace of Kings Road, main eventing against Takao Omori on the February event and teaming with Taichi Ishikari against Mitsuya Nagai and Daisuke Ikeda at the April event. By now the promotion was in serious trouble, as Kawada's participation never materialized and they had no wrestlers that were draws as Tenryu had only wrestled on the first event. Their next two events would be held in much smaller venues (with the attendance under 500 for both), and on July 1, 2006 the main event would be a special 5 vs. 5 match against Zero-One Max, with the stipulation being that if Kings Road lost then they would disband. Kings Road would lose the match resulting in Kings Road folding for good. After Kings Road went under, Miyamoto failed to gain entrance back into a major promotion. He had wrestled in New Japan during his Kings Road stint, facing Tanahashi on March 19, 2006, but it did not lead to a permanent position. On January 20, 2007 he appeared in Osaka Pro Wrestling as the secret new member of Bad Force Stable, but he only wrestled on one card and was not seen again. He also wrestled for Riki Choshu's Lock Up Promotion in mid-2007 but he was not invited back. Unable to find steady work, Miyamoto created his own promotion in the fall of 2007 called Super Bulls with himself being the ace of the promotion. After a few brief months Super Bulls held its last show in December 2007. he wrestled Great Sasuke in the main event with Sasuke picking up the victory by DQ. Miyamoto is still young, in 2008, Miyamoto still has not found his way onto a full-time roster although he has gotten a look from Pro Wrestling Noah, wrestling for there spinoff promotion Pro Wrestling SEM as well as Tatsumi Fujinami's Dradition promotion. In January 2014, Miyamoto began working for Wrestle-1, billed as the \\"Japanese Million Dollar Man\\".http://www.w-1.co.jp/news/detail.php?id=2390 In February 2015, Miyamoto began working for Union Pro Wrestling, where he formed a heel stable with Fuma and Sagat.

Biography  Ricardo Araujo Ricardo Araujo was born in 1978 in Bogota (Colombia). Since his very youth, he evolved in the abstract universe of painting and music. He began his musical studies in 1989 with pianist Lile Tiempo, and in 1990, as Marie-Louise Toupouzien's student, he was awarded by Belgium Superior Jury in the excellence category. At 12, he gave his first piano recital in Brussels, playing Bach and Mozart. Seven months later, he made his debut with Brussels' Royal Conservatoire chamber orchestra, when Martha Argerich noticed him. In 1991, back in Colombia, he simultaneously went on with his pianist, music director and composer training. He quickly became Dimitr Manolov's assistant, then second music director of the Colombia Symphony Orchestra. Before leaving Colombia in February 1998 to settle in Paris, Ricardo Araujo chose to dedicate himself exclusively to music writing and orchestras' direction. As a musician, he has favoured reflexion and search for a union between the composer's thoughts and his own identity. Through the years, he has tended to put aside immediate virtuosity in favour of discovering colours and thoughts in order to modernize works. \\"Music from the past should help us to understand our present because great men's work must be looked at with contemporary eyes to be reborn and to talk to us plainly\\". Since 1993, Ricardo Araujo has given many concerts in Latin America: Bogota, Caracas, Vina del Mar, Santiago, Buenos Aires, as well as in Europe: Brussels, Namur, Paris, Chartres, Dijon, Vienna, Bonn, Dresden, Bamberg, Nuremberg, Lausanne, London, Rome, etc. As a conductor and besides his part in the Colombia Symphony Orchestra, he was in charge of creating several works during the 1997 Bogota contemporary music festival. He then has directed Mozart concertos from his piano with Rome's Santa Cecilia Orchestra. Ricardo Araujo has worked with keys figures such as Michel Merlet, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Marek Janowski, Henri Dutilleux and Mstislav Rostropovitch. He has performed in Royal Conservatory of Brussels, Caracas Teatro Teresa Carreno, Municipal Theatre of Santiago, Buenos Aires Teatro Col√≥n, in Paris Salle Cortot, Bamberg Symphony, Lausanne Salle Metropole, Konzerthaus, Vienna, etc. He has directed Colombia Symphony Orchestra since 1996, and since 1998, Paris Opera Orchestra, Stuttgart Radio-Sinfonieorchester, Bayerische Staatsphilarmonie and many more. In 2003, he became William Christie's assistant during the Paris National Opera creation of J.P. Rameau's Bor√©ades and then, Armin Jordan's with a new interpretation of Mozart Cos√¨ fan tutte. The very same year, he has been invited to play two recitals in Colombia. Both have been unanimously greeted by the national press. Since February 2004, he has been a regular guest at Paris Cercle de l'Union Interalli√©. As a committed artist, Ricardo Araujo has been actively offering his help to Colombia Rotary Club supervising the \\"Mecenazgo Rotario\\" project which promotes young talents and offer them the opportunity to perform several concerts and to record a CD. In 2005, the Rotary Club has invited Ricardo Araujo to play Mozart's concerto n¬∞23 to celebrate the International Rotary centenary. In March 2005, he was named as musical director of Cartagena de Indias New Opera and Festival, and has been in charge of musical programming. As a composer, some of his works came into being during events such as Colombia Contemporary music festival in Bogota, or Gerberoy festival in France. Some of the interpreters were Eduardo Herrera, Oscar Hernandez, Dimitr Manolov, and Anne-Julie Kerkhello. In 2001, he has worked for the IRCAM, when he composed two works of electronic music which would be re-arranged for symphony orchestra afterwards. In 2007, willing to gather Latin American young talents, he has founded with the help of Latin American diplomatic missions the New Latin American Philharmonic Orchestra and became its musical director. Under his influence, the Orchestra has aimed to promote his continent symphonic repertoire.

Early life Chapple was born in Alexandra in Central Otago, New Zealand. His parents were the farmer John Cole Chapple and Elizabeth McEwan Chapple (n√©e AllanNote that the source spells her maiden name 'Allen', but given that sons commonly adopted their mother's maiden name at that time, the spelling is presumably a mistake). He received his early education at Alexandra Primary School. He commenced a medical degree at Otago University and in 1888 went to King's College Hospital for one year. He returned to Otago in the following year to complete his degree, and graduated in 1890 with MB ChB. He was first registered as a medical professional on 10 May 1890 and went to Motueka, where he became Public Vaccinator and Native Medical Attendant for the Nelson district. He became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1897, became MRCP&S; in Ireland in 1897 and obtained further qualifications in Dublin (Dip State Med, DPH). He obtained his Doctor of Medicine (MD) from Otago University in 1899. Chapple married Sarah Douglas Turnbull on 1 January 1891 at St Johns Presbyterian Church in Willis Street, Wellington. His wife, five years younger than him, was born in San Francisco. Her father was the Wellington architect Thomas Turnbull. At the time, Chapple was still living in Motueka, but later that year, his father-in-law designed him a large house to be built on the corner of Willis and Dixon Streets in Wellington. He moved to Wellington in 1892, where he continued to practice medicine. He was interested in issues of education and was a philanthropist. He was the president of the Wellington Swimming Club. He served on the Victoria College Council (these days the Victoria University of Wellington) until 1907. Member of Parliament Chapple was associated with the New Zealand Liberal Party. He unsuccessfully stood as an Independent Liberal against William Henry Peter Barber in the Newtown electorate in the 1902 and 1905 general elections. William Chapple represented the Tuapeka electorate in the New Zealand House of Representatives from June to October 1908 after a by-election, but was defeated in the 1908 general election by Robert Scott. Later, Chapple was a Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons at Westminster. He represented Stirlingshire from January 1910 until the constituency was abolished at the 1918 general election. On the reorganisation of constituencies in 1918, he was unsuccessful in Clackmannan and Eastern Stirlingshire, but returned at the 1922 general election as MP for Dumfriesshire, holding that seat until his defeat at the 1924 general election.

Professional wrestling career Tsukioka made his professional wrestling debut in 1999, working under his real name for International Wrestling Association of Japan for the first year of his career. When Tsukioka joined Osaka Pro Wrestling he adopted a masked clown gimmick, the comedic character \\"Kuishinbo Kamen\\" who wore a clown suit and even had a hat with yellow pom-poms attached to the mask. He quickly developed a storyline feud with another comedic masked wrestler known as Ebessan. Kamen defeated Ebessan to become the first ever holder of the Osaka Meibutsu Sekaiichi Championship (roughly translated into the \\"World's Best Osaka Attraction Championship\\"). On June 29, 2002 he became a double champion winning a battle royal to become the Osaka Pro Wrestling Battle Royal Champion). A title he would hold for a month and a half before losing it in another battle royal. February 2, 2003 Kurishinbo Kamen's feud with Ebessan hit its peak as Ebessan defeated Kurishinbo Kamen to win the Osaka Meibutsu Sekaiichi Championship, but more importantly the loss forced Tsukioka to give up the Kurishibo Kamen character. He would return to the ring a week later as \\"\\"Super Robo K\\", a robot gimmick completed with a more mechanical wrestling style. The character change only lasted for a couple of months before Kurishinbo Kamen returned to the ring. He regained the Meibutso Sekaiichi Championship on February 21, 2004 almost a year to the day he lost it. In March 2003 Kurishinbo Kamen and other Osaka Pro Wrestling representatives traveled to the United States of America, where they were part of the 2004 World X-Cup in TNA Wrestling.

The dance reenacts the invasion led by Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado and his confrontation with Tecun Uman, ruler of K'iche' kingdom of Q'umarkaj. Although the dance is more closely associated with Guatemalan traditions, it has been performed in early colonial regions of Latin America at the urging of Catholic friars and priests, as a method of converting various native populations and African slaves to the Catholic Church. The danceOrigins= The dance is based upon the Spanish Baile de los Moros (\\"Dance of the Moors\\") which recounts and commemorates the expulsion of the Moorish rule from Spain.Video of Baile de los Moros performance in Chiquimula (SPANISH) The Baile de la Conquista borrows its structure directly from the Baile de los Moros. =Baile de la Conquista in Guatemala= The dance begins in Q'umarkaj (also known by its Nahuatl translation, Utatl√°n), the capital of the kingdom, where the Rey K'iche (\\"King K'iche'\\") receives word of the Spaniards' approach from Aztec ruler Moctezuma II in Tenochtitlan. The king then sends his sons and daughters to Xelajuj Noj (now Quetzaltenango) to recruit Tecun Uman to lead the army against the approaching foes. Following scenes depict the K'iche' chieftains and then the Spanish officers swearing allegiance to their respective leaders. Soon after, a battle ensues between the Spanish and native troops, culminating with the battle between Alvarado and Tec√∫n Um√°n. The K'iche' army is soon defeated, and echoing the Baile de los Moros, the dance concludes as the K'iche' warriors submit peaceably to Spanish rule and embrace Christianity.Barbara Bode. 1961. The Dance of the Conquest of Guatemala. New Orleans: Middle American Research Institute, Tulane University. The confrontation between Tecun Uman and Pedro de Alvarado is the central theme of the Guatemalan version of the Baile de la Conquista. =Tecun Uman= The true existence of a historical Tecun Uman is subject of ongoing debate. One piece of evidence to suggest he lived comes from a letter written by Alvarado to Hern√°n Cort√©s. However, the letter is quite sparing in details, with Alvarado only mentioning of the battle that ensued: \\"in this affair one of the four chiefs of the city of Utatl√°n was killed, who was the captain general of all this country.\\"Pedro de Alvarado. 1969. An Account of the Conquest of Guatemala in 1524 by Pedro de Alvarado. Sedley J. Mackie, ed. New York: Kraus Reprint Co. Alvarado did not provide a name for the K'iche' general, nor did he mention how or by whose hand the man was killed. Several other indigenous documents describe the arrival of Alvarado in what would become Guatemala, including the T√≠tulo C'oyoi which describes the battle in terms similar to the modern legend. This document also contains the earliest known reference to the K'iche' leader as Tecum Umam. The Popol VuhDennis Tedlock. 1996. Popol Vuh: The Definitive Edition of the Mayan Book of the Dawn of Life and the Glories of Gods and Kings. confirms the observations of Bartolom√© de las Casas and the T√≠tulo de Totonicap√°n, which record that four lords ruled the K'iche' at the time of the Spanish conquest. The first-born son of the Keeper of the Mat (the most powerful of the lords) was expected to prove himself by leading the K'iche' army and was given the title \\"nima rajpop achij\\", the same title given to Tecun Uman in the T√≠tulo K'oyoi. This is all tied together by the genealogy of the K'iche' lords that is given near the end of the Popul Vuh and a section of the T√≠tulo de Totonicapan, which both refer to the son of the Keeper of the Mat as \\"Tecum\\" at the time of Alvarado's arrival. A second explanation for the absence of greater detail in Alvarado's letter is that Tecun Uman actually did battle with one of Alvarado's subordinates by the name of Argueta. This suggestion is based on the claim of Argueta's descendants that the lance they keep as an heirloom of their predecessor is stained with the blood of the K'iche' hero.Tecum Umam: ¬øPersonaje M√≠tico o Hist√≥rico? (SPANISH) Since there is little documentation to prove the existence of a lord named Tecun Uman, it has been suggested that his name was created in order to replace the role of the \\"Moorish prince\\", the central antagonist of the Baile de los Moros. This theory has yet to be proven, and is given little attention in light of pre- existing documents speaking of a historical Tecun Uman long before the first performances of Baile de la Conquista. =Variations= The Baile de la Conquista is not unique to Guatemala; variations of the dance have been performed throughout Latin America with differences based on local folklore. The one constant in all forms of the dance is the resolution, a religious conversion of the native or ‚Äúpagan‚Äù population.

He is the son of former Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance wrestler Mitsu Hirai. Professional wrestling careerSuper World Sports (1991‚Äì1992)= Hirai originally trained in the SWS dojo under wrestling legend: Genichiro Tenryu and debuted for Super World Sports on April 25, 1991. During his time in SWS, Hirai was never pushed as he spent the time paying his dues and gaining experience. Hirai would remain with SWS until it folded in June 1992. =WAR (1992‚Äì2000)= After SWS folded, Hirai joined Tenryu's new promotion: WAR. In WAR, Hirai continued to remain in the midcard for most of the early-to mid 1990s. While working in WAR, Hirai also made appearances in New Japan Pro Wrestling. In March 1994, Hirai took part in New Japan's Young Lion Cup defeating Tatsuhito Takaiwa in the first round but would unable to win the tournament with Satoshi Kojima eventually emerging as the winner. In May 1994, Hirai participated in a few live events for the WWF during their Japanese tour as he took on wrestlers such as Doink the Clown, Headshrinker Samu, and The Smokin' Gunns. He also took part in a Royal Rumble. By 1997, Hirai began to move up the card. On July 25, 1997, Hirai teamed with Mitsuharu Kitao and Tommy Dreamer in a match for the vacated WAR World Six-Man Tag Team Championship but lost to Koki Kitahara, Nobutaka Araya, and Lance Storm. On October 27, Hirai would finally win his first title when he teamed with Kitao and Masaaki Mochizuki to defeat Kitahara, Araya, and Storm to win the WAR Six-Man Tag Team Titles. In November 1997, Hirai took part in a tournament to crown the first J-1 World Heavyweight Champion but lost in the first round to Nobutaka Araya. On July 1, 1998, Kitao would retire from wrestling and the WAR Six Man Tag Titles were vacated.

In July 2003, the team took part in the All-Asian Tag League tournament for the vacated All Asia Tag Team Championship but they finished in last place with 3 Points. On September 6, Hirai and Okumura challenged Kohei Sato and Hirotaka Yokoi for the All-Asia Tag Team Titles but they came up short. In early 2004, Hirai would briefly change his name to Mitsu Hirai Jr. but the name change did little for his career. On January 8, 2004, Hirai and Okumura received another shot at the All-Asia Tag Titles against Great Kosuke and Shiryu but lost. In late 2004, Hirai would form a new team with Nobutaka Araya and the two entered the 2004 World's Strongest Tag Determination League but they finished in last place of their block with 0 points. From 2005 to 2008, Hirai would spend his time in the low midcard and as a jobber as he wouldn't compete for titles and was left off tournaments.

On November 3, at Pro Wrestling Love in Ryogoku Vol. 6, Hirai teamed with TARU and brother YASSHI to defeat Suwama, Kaz Hayashi, and Ryuji Hijikata with Hirai pinning Hayashi. Afterward, Hirai would change his name to Hate and would proceed to change his look by wearing facepaint and would use a fire extinguisher as a weapon. Hate would team with TARU in the 2008 World's Strongest Tag Determination League where they finished in 7th place with 4 points. In 2009, Hate would lose weight and drop to the junior heavyweight division. On October 25, Hate would challenge Kaz Hayashi for the World Junior Heavyweight Championship but lost. In April 2010, Hate would team with Minoru in the 2010 Junior Tag League, where they finished in 4th place with 2 points. In early 2011, Hate would become Super Hate and would enter the 2011 Junior Tag League teaming with MAZADA but the two finished in last place with 2 points. On May 29, 2011, Hirai was involved in a backstage fight with TARU, which led to Hirai suffering a stroke after competing in a match. He would eventually undergo successful surgery. Following the incident, all Japanese members of the Voodoo Murders (TARU, Minoru, KONO, and MAZADA) were suspended indefinitely from All Japan, the Voodoo Murders stable was disbanded and Keiji Mutoh resigned as the president of the promotion. As of February 2013, Hirai was still recovering from the incident, but was looking to eventually return to professional wrestling.http://www.cyzo.com/2013/02/post_12483.html =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2004)= Hirai competed in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's 2004 World X-Cup Tournament as a member of Team Japan where they finished the tournament in last place with 2 points.

Behind the modern day park lays a history which can be traced back to the medieval period, when the first park was laid out. Over the following centuries the park went through many changes, from arable fields to an enclosed designed 18th century park and hall and finally at the beginning of the 20th century into the public park of today. The park has many features that mark this history: ancient veteran trees, historic lost roads, old arable field patterns, the 18th century park and buildings and the remains of a Second World War army camp.

It was developed in the early 20th century by Harry S. Lamon, who was the senior poultry expert at the Bureau of Animal Industry, an agency that was eventually replaced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service. History Working at the Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland, Lamon crossed White Plymouth Rocks, Silver-Gray Dorkings and White Leghorns to produce the Lamona. The effort began in 1912 and by 1933 it was recognized as a breed by admittance into the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection. A bantam version was miniaturized from the standard Lamona, and it was recognized by the APA in 1960. Due to their strong production characteristics, Lamonas endured a brief popularity in the first half of the 20th century. But after the 1950s, commercial chicken farms switched to the two breeds that dominate the industry into the 21st century: the Cornish-Rock hybrid for meat and the White Leghorn for eggs. By the 1980s, Lamonas were close to extinction. The work of a few dedicated preservationists, such as Marion Nash of Illinois, perpetuated the breed for a time. But today, the original Lamona is very rare. There are reports from American Livestock Breeds Conservancy and anecdotal sources, the most recent circa 2005, of one or two breeding flocks still in existence, but none of these breeders offer Lamonas for sale. One line of Lamonas was created in the early 2000s by Steve Gerdes of Illinois. He recreated this line using the same methods that were used by Harry Lamon to create the originals. After his death in 2012 these birds went to two separate breeders who are still working on them. Since the disappearance of the original large Lamona, Jeremy Trost used the breeds known to have first been used in its creation to reconstitute a new bantam Lamona which was finalized in the first five years of the 21st century. Characteristics Lamonas weigh more than the light Leghorn, but less than the large Plymouth Rock and Dorking. They have yellow skin and white plumage, which makes them ideal meat birds for the U.S. market. They have single combs and red earlobes, and while chickens with red earlobes usually lay brown eggs, Lamonas lay large white eggs. Also unlike most chickens, Lamonas were once said to retain quality as a meat bird after they had passed their egg laying prime (2-3 years).

The first version of the Sonata movement, completed around 1919 (although Ives stated in his \\"Memos\\" that it was actually \\"finished\\" in 1913), had many simplified passages, and omitted several passages that had been some of the \\"Centrifugal Cadenzas\\" of the Concerto (this version was published in 1921). These cadenza passages became \\"Studies\\" for piano. The passages that were retained in the Sonata movement that had been simplified were restored to their original state in the \\"Four Transcriptions from 'Emerson'\\" that were assembled between 1915 and ca. 1923. When Ives recorded the Transcriptions in the 1930s, he restored most of these cadenza passages to the Transcriptions, and one photostat copy of the Transcriptions (\\"Copy C\\") shows how they were to be reinstated in writing (cf. the CD \\"Ives Plays Ives\\" for his recordings). Most of the more complex original text passages of the Sonata movement were restored to the Sonata in its second edition, in the 1940s. The Concerto was edited from all the extant sources: the existing Concerto sketches, the Sonata movement, the Studies, the Transcriptions, and verbal memoranda regarding the evolution of the music that Ives wrote as program notes to the Sonata movement. The manuscript sources for each have many verbal memoranda that refer back to the original idea of the Concerto, identifying materials for piano cadenzas, and for specific orchestral instruments. The \\"viola part\\" to the Sonata movement is not to be played by a viola. It is simply \\"the viola part\\" from the last page of the original Concerto sketch (where it is doubled by bassoon, and the downbeats to each triplet figure are doubled by tubular bells). When Ives added the line back to the Sonata movement (in the copy of the Transcriptions made by copyist Reiss), in both pencil sketch and ink patch, he simply called it \\"viola part\\". Ives never intended it to be played by a viola. This is not the same as the optional flute part in the \\"Thoreau\\" movement, where a flute player is explicitly called for.

Platt specialized in kidney disease research, but he is remembered for the 1940-1950s Platt vs. Pickering debate with George White Pickering over the nature of hypertension. Platt's position was that hypertension was a simple disease caused by perhaps just one genetic defect, and he presented evidence of its autosomal dominant inheritance and a bimodal distribution of blood pressures, indicating that hypertensives were a distinct subpopulation in humans. In contrast, Pickering's viewpoint was that blood pressures varied continuously and unimodally, with hypertensives representing the upper end of the bell curve. Though Platt's view was favoured during his lifetime, Pickering's view ultimately dominated and is the basis of current understanding and treatment policies. During his lifetime, Platt held the salaried position of head of the Central Manchester Health authority, and he later (1957‚Äì1962) became the president of the Royal College of Physicians. During his presidency he was influential in the writing and publication of the first College report on Smoking and Health, which assembled all the evidence for a causative relationship. It predated the first report on smoking and lung cancer from the US Surgeon General, which appeared in 1964. On 14 July 1959 he was made a Baronet 'of Grindleford'. On 16 January 1967 he was created a life peer as Baron Platt, of Grindleford, in the County of Derby. On his death the baronetcy was inherited by his son: the life peerage became extinct. His autobiography, titled Private and Controversial, was published in the UK by Cassell and Company in 1972.

After the Portuguese were expelled by Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia, it was changed to its present name Fort Olimpo. History Initially, Fort Borb√≥n was established as a guard post by order of King Carlos IV of Spain with the purpose of withstanding attacks by the natives and the Portuguese on the lands under Spanish jurisdiction. On October 17, 1791, Viceroy of R√≠o de la Plata ordered the creation of Fort Borb√≥n. The governor of the province of Paraguay, Joaqu√≠n Al√≥s y Br√∫, ordered the establishment of two forts in the north: Borb√≥n and San Carlos del Apa to restrict the advance of the cavalry. To this effect he ordered the commander of Villa de Concepci√≥n to prepare food supplies and other elements for the troops who would march from Asunci√≥n to those places. Fort Borb√≥n was founded on September 25, 1792 by the King‚Äôs Chief of Dragoons (cavalry), Jos√© Antonio Zavala y Delgadillo, with Jos√© de Isasi as its first commander. The Mbay√° and Guan√° natives inhabited the lands near the fort, and there was always distrust among them. The natives were encouraged by the Portuguese to steal and murder the people in the Spanish states. The stolen cattle were then sold to the Portuguese in exchange for weapons and liquor. View of Fort Borbon. The Spanish tried to gain the friendship of the caciques (chiefs of the tribe) mbay√°s but they attacked Villa Real de Concepci√≥n in 1796, and because of it the military forces in the village massacred the families of the natives settled nearby, killing about 75 of them. With the passing time, the interactions between the natives and the soldiers of Fort Borb√≥n and Villa de Concepci√≥n became friendlier, and the authorities of Asunci√≥n signed temporary peace treaties with Chief Lorenzo. Fort Borbon. In spite the temporarily friendly arrangements, the owners of state in Concepci√≥n continued to suffer because the siege of several Mbay√° tribes kept the village in a state of constant danger. Borb√≥n was fortified. Once the news of the war in 1801 between Spain and Portugal became public, Governor L√°zaro de Rivera proposed pointlessly to take the Portuguese fort of Coimbra and settle more to the north in the lands of the Spanish Crown. Maintaining the 100 soldiers stationed in Borb√≥n became more difficult as time passed, due to the long distance and the lack of communication. The history of the fort records episodes of hunger, misery and abandon. Shipments of food from Concepci√≥n were irregular and insufficient. There are records that troops from the fort participated in the 1810 fight against the invasion of general Belgrano. On that occasion, the fort was abandoned; the Mbay√°s took possession of it and later also the Brazilian forces of Coimbra. The Junta Superior Gubernativa (Superior Government Council), instituted by the revolutionaries in 1811 after the independence of the country, called Fernando de la Mora to recover the fort by force, which was not necessary because the Portuguese retreated and it was given back to the Paraguayans. During the dictatorship of Rodr√≠guez de Francia, around 1817, the fort was reinforced with a stone wall three kilometers long and new housing was built for the occupants. Current times Since 1823, was renamed as Fort Olimpo in demonstration of the breaking bonds with the Spanish Crown. Nowadays, the remains of the impressive defensive wall can still be found, and from the top of it, it‚Äôs possible to have a strategic view of great of the Paraguay River. With the new political distribution in 1992, the town of Fort Olimpo became the capital of the Alto Paraguay department and this, the place of the town council.

Early life Born in Christchurch in 1874, Hunter was a farmer, storekeeper, carter, and trade unionist. Political career Hunter stood for the Christchurch East electorate in the New Zealand House of Representatives in for the Labour Party (original), for the Social Democratic Party and for the New Zealand Labour Party. His best result was losing by 136 votes in 1911 in a close three-way contest, and failing to qualify for the subsequent run-off election by just four votes. He was President of the LRC (1911‚Äì1913) and of the Social Democratic Party (1913‚Äì1915). In , he contested the Mid-Canterbury electorate as an Independent Labour candidate against Jeremiah Connolly, but was unsuccessful. During the 1930s, Hunter became increasingly disillusioned with the NZ Labour Party and argued that: \\"We have learned much of socialisation through its application in Russia. The result has been servility for the workers under the domination of dictators and, what seemed a book of beautiful ideal in 1915 has turned out to be in practice, a horrible reality\\".(The Christchurch Press, 6 October 1938) In 1938 he stood for the conservative National Party against his former Labour comrade Dan Sullivan who beat him by a three to one margin, with the election-night crowd booing him so loudly his speech could not be heard leaving Hunter with an undignified end to his public career. Hiram Hunter was a member of the Christchurch City Council for ten years (1911‚Äì1915; 1917‚Äì1923). Death Hunter died in 1966 at Ashburton.

An early member of the KNIP, he briefly served as the head of government during the Indonesian Revolution when fellow revolutionaries Sukarno and Hatta were captured. Following the independence war, he served under Sukarno's cabinet in multiple positions before being arrested and removed due to his involvement in the PRRI rebellion. Early life Sjafruddin was born in Anyer Kidul, Banten on 28 February 1911, of a Bantenese-Minangkabau father and Bantenese mother.Akmal Nasery Basral, Presiden Prawiranegara: Kisah 207 hari Syafruddin Prawiranegara Memimpin Indonesia, 2011 In 1931, he graduated from AMS in Bandung. He wanted to continue his study in Leiden, but his family could not afford this, so he studied at the Law Faculty in Jakarta and earned a Meester in de Rechten degree in September, 1939. In 1939‚Äì1940 he was an editor of Soeara Timur, a journal sponsored by Soetardjo Kartohadikoesoemo. Syafruddin was more strongly nationalist than this however, refusing to join the Stadswacht (home guard), though he did in 1940 join the Dutch department of finance. He retained his job under the Japanese occupation, working as a tax inspector. Political career After the proclamation of independence on 24 August 1945, he joined the KNI (Indonesian National Committee), becoming one of fifteen members of its Central Committee. In 1946, he joined Masjumi, the Islamic political party, publishing 'Politiek dan Revolusi Kita' (Our Politics and Revolution). He espoused a religious socialist philosophy, which led to his appointment as deputy minister of finance in Sjahrir's second cabinet from 12 March 1946 to 27 June 1947, Minister of Finance for Sjahrir's third cabinet from 2 October 1946 to 27 June 1947, as well as being Minister of Finance under Hatta's non- party cabinet and the continuation from 29 January 1948 until full independence in December 1949. The resistance to the Dutch was limited to Java and Sumatra, and increasing military success in Java made the position of the revolutionary leaders in Java increasingly weak. In anticipation of the Dutch overrunning the revolutionary Indonesian capital at Yogyakarta, Hatta was given authority to set up a republican government in defensible Central Sumatra. Hatta was to return to Java for UN-led peace talks, however, so Sjafruddin was given the role of Prime Minister-in-waiting. When the Dutch captured Sukarno, Hatta, and others, he assumed the role of president in the Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia in Bukittinggi, West Sumatra, liaising by radio with remaining nationalists in Java to organize resistance to the Dutch. From this position he was able to maintain the republican effort until the Dutch released Sukarno and Hatta. After Indonesia obtained full independence, Shafruddin continued to serve as minister of finance from 1 January 1950 to 6 September 1950 and 6 September 1950 to 20 March 1951 under Natsir leadership. He was then appointed as Governor of the Bank Indonesia until 1957. PRRI rebellion Sjafruddin in 1957 came into conflict with the President over his opposition to nationalization of Dutch economic interests, and his opposition to Guided Democracy, culminating in the writing of a letter to Sukarno on 15 January 1958, from Palembang, South Sumatra, where Sjafruddin was in talks with the rebellious Colonel Barlian, telling Sukarno to return to the Indonesian Constitution. He was sacked as Bank Indonesia governor as a result, as Sjafruddin became more involved with the rebels called Pemerintahan Revolusioner Republik Indonesia. Sjafruddin was less reckless than some of his PRRI colleagues, opposing the five-day ultimatum (on strategic military grounds) on 10 February 1958 to Prime Minister Djuanda Kartawidjaja to establish a new Cabinet with Hatta and Hamengkubuwono IX, the Sultan of Yogyakarta, at its head. Therefore, on 15 February 1958, Sjafruddin became Prime Minister of PRRI; his signature, which had appeared on banknotes of the republican period (1945‚Äì1949), and as governor of Bank Indonesia (1951‚Äì1958), appeared on the notes of PRRI. Sjafruddin opposed the establishment of a separate country of Sumatra, instead seeing PRRI as a movement for Indonesian integrity, opposed to the centralization of power in Indonesia. Then, the rebellion was a failure, and on 25 August 1961, Sjafruddin surrendered to the army. He was imprisoned until 26 July 1966, although he was granted official amnesty in 1961. Post rebellion Upon release, Sjafruddin tended to express himself more through religion, preaching against corruption under Suharto, and leading the Petition of Fifty, and opposing the concept of Pancasila as the sole guiding principle for all groups, especially religious ones, in Indonesia. On 7 July 1983 he wrote an open letter to Suharto to protest against the provision in the draft law that endorsed the concept. Due to this activity, Suharto banned Sjafruddin from leaving the country except for medical treatment. Death He died of a heart attack on 15 February 1989. Personal life He married to Tengku (Princess) Halimah, daughter of the Camat of Buahbatu and descendant of the Minangkabau Rajah of Pagaruyung on 31 January 1941.

He left to form the Henry Paul Band but then returned to the Outlaws. He also is a founding member of the country band BlackHawk.  Biography Early life= Henry was born in Kingston, New York, and lived on a farm in nearby Hurley, but when his father and mother divorced, Henry, his sisters Anselma and Helen, and his mother moved to Temple Terrace, a suburb of Tampa, Florida, as a young boy. At the age of 17, he played his first music gigs at High School folk festivals and playing at the 18th String Coffee House and Music Emporium in Tampa, and by 1969, he had moved back north to Greenwich Village, New York, to pursue a career in music. While living in New York he retraced the footsteps of his hero Bob Dylan and played on the streets to make a living while cutting demos for Epic Records. With an invitation to play a concert in his hometown, he returned to Tampa in 1971. There, Henry and Jim Fish formed the country rock group Sienna with future Outlaw members Monte Yoho and Frank O'Keefe. =The Outlaws= In 1972 the group Sienna disbanded and Paul joined the group \\"The Outlaws\\" which had been formed in 1967. They started playing clubs around the Tampa area and added Billy Jones. By 1974 they were on the road opening shows for several established Southern rock groups including Lynyrd Skynyrd. Clive Davis of Arista Records discovered them and signed the group to their first record deal; they became the fledgling label's first rock band. Their self-titled debut album quickly went gold on the success of hits like \\"Green Grass and High Tides,\\" and \\"There Goes Another Love Song.\\" In 1977, after recording two more albums with the Outlaws, Henry left to pursue a solo career. After several short lived \\"reunions\\" and the death of Hughie Thomasson, the Outlaws 2008 came to fruition due to the efforts of Henry Paul and Monte Yoho. In 2012 the Outlaws released the critically acclaimed album, \\"It's About Pride\\". The band still tours extensively throughout the United States with the current lineup which includes Henry, Monte Yoho (drums), Randy Threet (bass guitar), Dave Robbins (keyboards), Dale Oliver(lead guitar) and Steve \\"Grits\\" Grisham (guitars). =Henry Paul Band= Within a year after leaving The Outlaws Henry founded the Henry Paul Band, debuting in 1979 with the album Grey Ghost. It included songs such as \\"So Long\\" and \\"Grey Ghost\\", which was dedicated to the memory of Lynyrd Skynyrd's Ronnie Van Zant. Henry Paul told Songfacts that he wrote \\"Lonely Dreamer\\" while visualizing a painting of a girl with the words \\"Lonely Dreamer\\" underneath. The band recorded three more albums including Feel The Heat in 1980, which had more of a rock edge and included the title track as well as \\"Whiskey Talkin'\\" and \\"Longshot\\" that went to #3 on the Billboard Bubbling Under The Hot 100 Singles Chart in 1980. Their third album was released in 1981, Anytime, included the hit \\"Keeping Our Love Alive\\" #50 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart and #23 Billboard Top Tracks(Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart) in 1982 with background vocals by Richard Paige of Mr. Mister & Bill Champlin of Chicago.

Henry's last, self-titled album was released in 1982, with the Henry Paul Band featured the songs \\"Hold On\\", Heat Of The Night\\" and the haunting song \\"Tragedy\\" . During the Henry Paul Band era, he also did Voice over work at WYNF-FM (95ynf) in Tampa Bay, Florida . In 1983, the Henry Paul Band disbanded as Paul reunited with Hughie Thomasson of the Outlaws. Their collaboration led to the 1986 release of The Outlaws' Soldiers of Fortune. Paul remained with the band until 1989, when he left again to start a new career in country music, founding BlackHawk in 1991. Van Stephenson and Dave Robbins joined Paul in BlackHawk to create a new blend of country music, using three-part harmonies and introspective songs. =Blackhawk= BlackHawk's No. 11 debut, \\"Goodbye Says It All\\", was heavily promoted on CMT during 1994. Following the platinum success of their self-titled debut album, they developed into a touring band. They have produced five studio albums, BlackHawk, Strong Enough, Love & Gravity, The Sky's the Limit, Spirit Dancer and one compilation album, Greatest Hits. In 2002, the group left Arista for Columbia Records, with one album ‚Äî 2002's Spirit Dancer ‚Äî being released on that label. The 2008 lineup is signed to Radiance Records. In July 2014 BlackHawk released its first studio album in 12 years called \\"Brothers of the Southland.\\" The title track is a tribute to Southern Rock bands and all those who have passed on.

The Association also provides professional development through an annual Music Educators' Conference. The Acronym The association name Amis is also French for the word friends. The founders of AMIS choose this name with the purpose of the association in mind. Amis symbolizes friendships established by children all over the world who attend AMIS Festivals. AMIS' vision is to create a music festival atmosphere that is a place of learning, laughing and most importantly coming together; this is reflected in its name. Although the association AMIS is based out of the United Kingdom, the association chose a French (as opposed to an English) name to represent the numerous nationalities that participate in and contribute to AMIS festivals all over the world. Mission statement Two girls captured wearing the 2013 European Middle School Honor Girls‚Äô Festival Shirt. ‚ÄúThe Association is an international, non-profit, non-sectarian, politically neutral organization dedicated to the promotion of excellence at all levels of music education. Its objectives are to advance the education of school pupils and teachers throughout the world by developing their understanding, knowledge and appreciation of music; to advance the education of young people and their teachers in global issues and cultural diversity through the performance and study of music; to promote high standards of musical performance in school pupils of all ages and abilities throughout the world; to promote furtherance of educationally valuable music repertoire.‚ÄùAMIS Mission Statement at www.amis-online.org.uk (accessed 2008-06-18) AMIS Festivals Once a year, there is a festival for each of the different categories. (See Festival Categories for list). Each festival is hosted by an AMIS Membership school, rotating between them yearly. To qualify for band, strings, and all High School auditions, students must audition by recordings, which are judged by a blind panel of music educators. Middle School Choir auditions are conducted by each participating school's teacher. The successful students travel to the host school and participate in the practice days and the final concert. The format is usually: travel Wednesday, rehearse Thursday-Saturday, concert Saturday evening, travel home Sunday.

AMIS' member schools mainly lie in Europe and Asia, with some participants in Africa (although at the moment there is one membership school that participates in festivals and hails from Central America). Founded in London, AMIS slowly grew across Western Europe and now has many festivals reserved only for Asian schools. Festivals are conducted in English, though due to the participants coming from within international school populations, most students (and many teachers) speak multiple languages. Concert repertoires always include multiple languages; and concert speeches and introductions are usually held in the (festival's) host country's language in addition to English. (For example: The 2014 European Middle School Honor Girls‚Äô Choir, hosted in Stavanger, Norway, had concert services conducted in Norwegian as well as English.) Conductors AMIS selects a different conductor for each festival. Often, conductors are teachers in international schools who are well respected and recommended by their peers. At the high school level, the Association contracts premiere conductors from around the world. Music The repertoire style depends on the AMIS festival and the songs that the conductor wants to play. Many times, AMIS has commissioned works by authors, making the band/choir present world-premiere songs. Such authors include Philip Sparke, David Brunner, Dr. Richard Prior, Christopher Marshall, and more.

The house, thought to be one of the oldest standing farmhouses in the county, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Background  Beginning when the original 1839 land grant was issued by President Martin Van Buren, the property was an active working farm until mid-1942 when then owner George Wright Young was infirm and left the property to live with relatives in central Mississippi. After he vacated the house, the property was then rented for several years. The house subsequently was closed and remained unoccupied for over six decades. Over time, weather and decay caused all outbuildings, including the barn, to fall but the house remained primarily due to the integrity of the corrugated metal roof. The house‚Äôs isolation in the woods hid and protected it from potential vandals. One of the first recent photographs of the c1840 Mitchell ‚Äì Foster ‚Äì Young House. This photo, taken c2003, with weatherboard peeling away, reveals the log timbers used for construction and shows the massive original stone fireplace. Rotting at the corners where vines and moisture encroached finally threatened to undermine the integrity of the structure and the unoccupied house was in danger of collapsing in 2005, when a plan to repair it was created. Those plans were abandoned when termite and other animal-caused damage was discovered. The house had been originally built too close to the ground, making it impossible to avoid future similar damage if the house was simply repaired without a proper higher foundation. Alternatively, a plan was implemented to dismantle the house it nail-by-nail and board-by-board and completely restore the house. A newly built barn housed the methodically marked and cataloged timbers and boards, until a new, raised foundation was built. Then, in reverse order, the timbers and boards were reassembled and reinstalled. Several unanticipated and yet to be explained building techniques and materials used in the house‚Äôs original construction were discovered during the restoration process. Additionally, a detailed review and assessment of each prior owner was performed using property and US Census records. Collectively, they established more clearly the phases and dates of construction.  History  Several years after the Treaty of Pontotoc Creek between the Chickasaw Nation and the government was signed in October of 1832, land grants were sold. The treaty ceded land that is now north Mississippi and western Tennessee. In Lafayette County, created in 1836, the more popular and in-demand land grants were near the rivers west of the town of Oxford. The land to the east was hillier and relatively less desirable for farming. In 1839, the US government issues a land-grant for the Mitchell ‚Äì Foster ‚Äì Young property, east of the town of Oxford, to Benjamin M. Mitchell, who apparently did not live on the property, but did live in Lafayette County. He applied for and received a brand from the newly formed Lafayette County, and used the property for his cattle that roamed freely. He likely built the original 20‚Äô x 20‚Äô log cabin c1840 for his overseers. John Cooper Hathorn, Early Settlers of Lafayette County Mississippi, Skipwith Historical and Genealogical Society, Inc, 1980. The original owner sold the property in 1847 Lafayette County Book of Deeds to the Fosters, a farming family of six that lived in the Paris community of Lafayette County, just south of Oxford. They were responsible for renovating the one room log cabin, converting it to a three-room house with a east-to-west gable roof. It took them several years to construct the addition to the house. In the 1860 US Census, US Census 1860 - Lafayette County, Paris, M653 Roll 585 Page 173 they were still living in the Paris community. The Fosters likely completed the house and moved before the outbreak of the Civil War. By the time of the 1870 US Census, US Census 1870 ‚Äì Lafayette County, Beat 1, M593, Roll 743 Page 498a, Part of Township 8, page 32 they are living in the house. This large farming family owned the house until 1894. Lafayette County Book of Deeds During the time they owned the property and lived in the house, it is likely the final construction was completed. George W. Young‚Äôs father-in-law, Edward Henry Woodward, bought this property and the adjacent property to the east in 1900, and along with his son, James Richard Woodward, moved their families from the Caswell Community just northeast of Oxford. Their families lived on the adjoining parcels of land and they shared the farming responsibilities. Things were going so well that Richard bought two more quarter sections bordering on the farm in 1902. They now owned 540 acres. Then everything changed for Richard. Henry died in 1904, and Henry‚Äôs wife, Richard‚Äôs mother, died a year later. Richard or someone very close to the family successfully convinced his sister Claudia and her new husband George W. Young to sell his farm in Panola County and to move to the property, where Claudia‚Äôs parents had lived until their recent death. George, Claudia, and their three children moved from Sardis to Lafayette County in 1905, and he farmed the property until 1942.  Description  The George Wright Young House is located east of Oxford, Mississippi.Lafayette County: \\"Tax Records\\", 2007. The house is a two story, side-gabled, center- hall planter‚Äôs cottage with a rear ell. The original c1840 cabin was a one- room structure with the massive stone fireplace, a north-to-south gable roof, no windows, and a door facing the north. The house was augmented in at least three phases and is believed to have taken its present form c1859. The main fa√ßade facing north is three bays wide (room 1, foyer hall and room 2) featuring double four-paneled door entrance in the central bay, flanked by a pair of six-over-nine, double-hung ‚Äúcottage‚Äù windows in each of the outer bays. An undercut gallery with plain square wood columns spans four-fifths of the fa√ßade and features a wooden deck. The west fa√ßade is also three bays wide (room 2, room 3 and room 4) featuring a brick shouldered chimney outside room 2 flanked by a pair of four-over-four windows on the main floor and a pair of two-over-three windows in the second floor attic, a pair of six-over-six windows in room 3, and an exit door in room 4. The rear of the house facing south is three bays wide (room 4, center hall and room 1). There are no windows at the end of ell, but there is a six-over-nine window on the rear of room 1. The rear has a single exterior door from the hall. The east fa√ßade is also three bays wide (room 4 and room 3 in the ell, and room 1) featuring a small two-over-two window in room 4, a single exterior door from room 3 and a massive sandstone shouldered chimney outside of room 1 flanked by a pair of two-over-three windows in the second-floor attic. The house rests on stone piers and the roof is clad in corrugated metal. The walls of the entire fa√ßade are clad in weatherboard siding.  Construction Phases  Constructed c1840, the house was originally a single 20‚Äô x 20‚Äô room (room 1) with a massive fireplace on the east wall. Artist‚Äôs concept of how the c1840 cabin looked. The building was constructed with large hand-hewn heart of pine timbers. Using a broad axe, the timbers were hewn flat on both the exterior and the interior sides. The rectangular hewn timbers were typically in excess of seventeen- inches high and six-inches deep. They were stacked horizontally from just above the ground to a height of approximately 12 feet at the eve of the gabled roof, which ran north-to-south. On the east side, the eve was just below the top of the chimney. The timbers, some twenty feet long, were joined at the corners with square notching. The sill timbers were supported at the corners with piers composed of stacked local rocks. There were generally two reasons that builders of the period hewed the exterior and/or the interior of the timbers into a flat surface. One, was to remove the bark and sapwood layers which, over time, promoted rotting, and the second reason was to apply weatherboard siding on the exterior and/or wall boards on the interior. The building likely had both interior wall boards and exterior weather strip siding. The interior ceiling in the cabin was eight feet high and the ceiling rafters were notched into the fourth from the top course of timbers, leaving about four feet of attic space at the eves, and approximately seven feet at the gable ridge. With a hole in the ceiling and a wall mounted ladder, occupants of the cabin likely used the space for sleeping and storage. The fireplace chimney on the exterior of the east wall extends to the original height of room 1 and is constructed from large blocks of local sandstone. The house was augmented with phase 2 c1859 with the center foyer hall, and the second room (room 2, the right front fa√ßade bay), a small front gallery, and a second story attic accessible by stairs in the hall. In phase 3, a third room, room 3, built c1870 directly behind the room 2, was constructed on a beam base using 2‚Äù x 4‚Äù wall studs spaced irregularly. Room 3 measures 15‚Äô 4‚Äù x 14‚Äô 0‚Äù. The interior wall of room 3 facing room 2 has the exterior weatherboard of room 2. Room 3 was built abutted to but not structurally integrated into the main house except with the roofing. The 9‚Äô 6‚Äù x 13‚Äô 6‚Äù room, room 4, was built behind room 3 at the same time, and is also built on a beam base using 2‚Äù x 4‚Äù studs spaced irregularly. Room 4, used as a kitchen, has an insulated chimney sleeve for a stovepipe. The original kitchen was built probably during phase 2 and detached from the house to isolate accidental fires. The vertical pine timber materials used in room 4 are similar to those used in room 2. The interior wallboard materials in room 4 are believed to be the wood that was used for the original detached kitchen when it was built during phase 2. The interior boards have square nail holes, indicating that they had been used prior to phase 3. In phase 3, the kitchen was attached to the house. Since the completion of phase 3 c1870, no significant alterations have been made to the house. Boyd, Charles P.: \\"NRHP Application\\", 2007.  Construction Techniques Phase 1: c1840 Log Cabin = The c1840 log cabin was built from pine logs laid horizontally and interlocked with notches on the ends. The logs were stacked to a height of eight feet, and the top rail notched to accommodate the ceiling rafters. Then logs were stacked for an additional four feet of height to accommodate a nominal amount of room in the attic. The attic, likely used for storage and sleeping, was accessed through a hole in the ceiling and a wall mounted ladder. The cabin roof was gabled, running north-to-south. The old-growth trees used had few limbs (knots) and were straight with little taper. The corner notches were not uniformly cut, indicating that each log‚Äôs corner notch was cut to match the specific cut of the adjoining log to minimize the size of the gap between the logs and reduced the amount of chinking (sticks or rocks) needed to fill the gap. The height of trees on the property determined the length of the available logs used in each wall. The cabin‚Äôs corners were set on large stones and additional stones were used for support at other points along the sill (bottom log). Here several of the near rotted log timbers have been replaced. The sill beams are visible as are the stone piles on which the house rests. The cabin was anchored on a fieldstone chimney; with mud applied to seal any gaps in the tight-fitting stones. The fireplace was used for cooking and for heat in the winter. There is no evidence that there were windows. Specifically, the west wall, where a door was cut in phase 2, was composed of 20‚Äô timbers. The entrance door was to the north; where, today, a window is installed. This photo shows the position of the original door centered on the north wall where a window is installed today. It is clear where the west corner was and how the old is incorporated into the phase 2 addition. Note the vertical board with the ‚ÄúPosted‚Äù sign has rail holes at the bottom for both at the top and lower rail of the original phase 2 porch. Also note that there are multiple sills supporting the cabin. This photo shows the northeast corner of the original cabin. The space under the window in the lowest course of logs, indicate that the original opening here was a door that was subsequently replaced by this window. =Phase 2: c1850 Addition = The second owner, who ultimately lived on the property, bought it in 1847 and held it for forty-seven years until 1894. Most of the phase 2 and subsequent construction probably occurred during this period. During this timeframe, balloon framing was a popular and inexpensive technique for many farm houses in the 19th century. Requiring no specialized skills, it utilized long continuous framing members (studs) that ran from sill plate to eave line with intermediate floor structures nailed to them, with the heights of window sills, headers and next floor height marked out on the studs. Surprisingly, balloon framing was not used on the c1850 addition, but rather a more complex method of mortise and tenon joinery that typically requires highly skilled workmen. The foyer, room 2, gable roof, and the attic were built to the right of room 1. The room 1 ceiling height of 8 feet was used throughout the addition. Framing - The vertical posts on the north and south side for room 2 and the foyer, built on an irregular beam base, were extended in length above the interior room ceiling to the top attic rail. The length was designed to match the height of the original room 1 roof. The vertical posts were long enough to extend about four feet above the ceiling joists. A top rail across the front (north side) of room 2 and the foyer and another across the rear (south side) of room 2 and the foyer tied the vertical beams all together. Each vertical post had a hand-made mortise at interior ceiling height to receive each ceiling joist, which had a tenon at each end. A wood peg secured each joint. The peg holes were chisel-cut with a square hole by hand, as opposed to round holes made with a drill, indicating construction in early 1800‚Äôs. The pegs were hand-formed with an ax from small cut blocks of wood and sized to each hole. Additionally, vertical water saw marks marking are on the vertical posts. Neither the room 2 nor the foyer framing used nails. During the restoration, the removed interior walls revealed that one of the vertical posts was larger than others and had an unused mortise. This indicated that mistakes were as common then as they are now, and that the builder found a way to adapt and use all available material. Interior Finishing - The foyer and room 2 had interior wall, floor, and ceiling boards installed. Included also at this time was a wainscot in the foyer and room 2. Room 1 also had interior wall and ceiling boards installed for the first time. Exterior Openings - The exterior doors into the house, a double door in the front and single door in the back, were now through the foyer. The original room 1 door facing the north was closed in and replaced by a window identical to the one used in the new room 2 windows. An interior door was cut through the massive beams in the west wall of room 1 for passage into the foyer. Windows - There may have been glass windows installed for the first time with phase 2. Alternatively, wooden shutters closed in the evenings would have been used. Around 1935 the current glass single pane windows were installed, replacing the prior windows or alternatively replacing the shutters. West Chimney - A brick fireplace and chimney was installed on the west end of room 2. The fireplace chimney in room 1 was extended in height to accommodate the gable roof height with brick similar to that used in the fireplace in the room 2. Roof - The complete building (room 1, foyer, and room 2) was covered by a gable roof that ran east-to-west. The roof material was cedar shakes. The shake roof was later replaced by corrugated metal. Attic - The gabled roof facilitated an attic. The current stairs were not installed until later, so access to the attic would have been in the foyer, perhaps with a ladder attached to the wall. Also, some attic flooring was added. The space was there, and probably badly needed and yet accessible only with a ladder. Porch ‚Äì Originally, a small undercut gallery with plain square wood posts spanned the width of the double front door and featured a wooden deck and a side rail. It may or may not have had a cover. This small porch was later replaced by the current large gallery porch. A larger undercut gallery with plain square wood posts spanning four-fifths of the fa√ßade and featuring a wooden deck and box columns replaced the original. Two exterior boards on either side of the front door have the mortise holes for the top and bottom porch rail of the original porch. Exterior Finishing - The entire house was covered with cedar weatherboard. At the front eave an intricate molding was installed. Similarly, across the rear a decorative molding was installed. Kitchen - The outdoor kitchen was probably built at the same time. Timbers similar to those used for the interior walls of room 1 and room 2 were used in the standalone kitchen.

Since 2008 it has also been referred to as Forvik Island as a result of Stuart \\"Captain Calamity\\" Hill's protest around constitutional matters. Location Detailed location map About south of Forewick Ness headland on Papa Stour and north of Melby on the Sandness peninsula. A small islet called Scarf's Head is accessible from Forewick Holm at low tide. Name The island is officially named Forewick Holm. Wick is an anglicisation of vik, a Norse and modern Norwegian word for bay. F√•r is sheep in modern Norwegian, Danish and Swedish. Holm is a common name in the Orkney and Shetland islands, and elsewhere, for a small, rounded island, an example is Stockholm. History There are no records of the island being permanently inhabited at any time, and in 2008 Stuart Hill was residing there for a few days a year. Its small size renders it unable to support any significant population. However, there is some evidence of a circular construction on its SSE tip, which could represent anything from a sheep pen, to a Pictish era building. The SS Highcliffe was wrecked on the islet on 6 February 1940. It was carrying a cargo of iron ore from Narvik, bound for Immingham.\\"Highcliffe\\" Shetlopedia. Retrieved 12 August 2008. Current ownership of the islet is in dispute between Papa Stour resident Mark King and Cunningsburgh resident Stuart Hill. Hill is an Englishman who settled in Shetland after being shipwrecked there in 2001 during a failed attempt to circumnavigate the British Isles, earning him the nickname \\"Captain Calamity\\". Hill claims that the island's udal title (allodial title) was donated to him in 2008 by the owner Mark King. He claims to have a signed, witnessed document confirming this. King has stated this is not the case, but that he had agreed to sell the island to Hill. In March 2009 King still claimed ownership stating that Hill had not paid for the island as agreed. =Declaration of Dependence= On 21 June 2008, Hill unilaterally declared Forvik Island to be a British Crown Dependency, and thus not a part of the United Kingdom or of the European Union. Initially the official name was the Crown Dependency of Forvik, although this was later changed to the Sovereign State of Forvik. The name Forvik was coined by Hill. \\"Forvik\\" is not a recorded historical form, but a pseudo-Norse version of \\"Forewick\\", which is the name of a headland on the adjacent island of Papa Stour. Forewick Holm from Sandness on Mainland Shetland with Papa Stour in the background In 2008 there were no full-time residents or permanent structures on the island. Hill announced his intention to erect a structure on the island, without planning permission. He travelled to and from the island on a small flat-bottomed plywood home made boat; in September 2008 he had to be rescued by a Coastguard helicopter and RNLI Lifeboat after his vessel began to sink. His boat was described as \\"ramshackle\\" and a \\"floating wardrobe\\" and was criticised by his rescuers for having no lifejacket or radio aboard. In July 2008 Hill announced that he was inviting companies to bid for oil exploration rights in Forvik's territorial waters. He claimed what he was trying to do with Forvik is illustrate to Shetlanders what they could achieve if they asserted their legal rights and similarly seceded from the United Kingdom. He is involved in other related secessionist activities in Shetland. Constitutional arguments Hill cited an arrangement struck in 1469 between King Christian I of Denmark/Norway and Scotland's King James III, whereby Christian effectively pawned the Shetland Islands to James in order to raise money for his daughter's dowry. He contended that, as the loan was never repaid and no other legal agreement ever put in place, Shetland remains in a constitutional limbo, and should properly enjoy the status of Crown Dependencies such as the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands. The validity of this was not accepted by the British government. Flag of the Sovereign State of Forvik Other activities Hill has sold \\"citizenships\\" for between ¬£60 and ¬£540: in 2008, he had sold around 100. Membership conditions were later changed to ¬£20 per annum, and in 2015 Hill claimed there were 218 members. Hill has refused to pay road tax or insurance to the UK government, instead creating documents issued by Forvik. In 2011 he was found guilty of driving offences arising from this.

A subdistrict of the Uptown/Carrollton Area, its boundaries as defined by the City Planning Commission are: South Claiborne Avenue, Leonidas and Fig Streets to the north, South Carrollton Avenue to the east, the Mississippi River and Jefferson Parish to the west. Although an official city planning district name, the name \\"Leonidas\\" is not widely used nor has it any historical usage and the area is usually referred to simply as \\"Carrollton\\". The designated neighborhood incorporates the upper-river half of what had been the town of Carrollton, Louisiana, in the 19th century. It is commonly known to locals simply as \\"Carrollton, or to distinguish this section, \\"Upper Carrollton\\" or \\"West Carrollton\\". The portion closer to the river is often called the \\"Riverbend\\" or \\"Carrollton Riverbend.\\" The section closer to the Jefferson Parish line is sometimes known as \\"Pigeon Town/Pension Town\\". Leonidas is a neighborhood in the city of New Orleans more commonly known to the locals as Pigeon Town / Pension Town. Today the area thrives on its commercial businesses but it also includes a large residential community. The formal name for the neighborhood, Leonidas, came from the famous Spartan King of 490 B.C. The name also is connected with the street that intersects the neighborhood, Leonidas Street. The informal name, Pigeon Town, has been passed down through generations. The name has its roots in the word, pidgin. It is defined as a simplified speech used for communication between people with different languages. Landmarks in the neighborhood include the Camellia Grill, Carrollton Streetcar Barn, Palmer Park, the Water Works, and the Oak Street commercial district including the well known Maple Leaf Bar. \\"Pegion Town Food Market\\" Leonidas Street  History  The Leonidas neighborhood area has history dating all the way back to the 1700s. Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, a French colonizer and the founder of the city of New Orleans, began a plantation in the area circa 1719. The land went on to remain a plantation for different types of agriculture well into the 1800s. The area was then bought by the New Orleans Canal and Banking Company and was divided into sections. In 1835, the first house was built and soon emerged a new neighborhood of the city of New Orleans. The Leonidas neighborhood is a part of a bigger whole called the town of Carrollton. In the 1850s, Dublin was the main street of the town of Carrollton. Fast forward almost a century and a half later in 1980, the town of Carrollton along with the Leonidas neighborhood was purchased and divided the city into 13 districts and 72 neighborhoods by the New Orleans City Planning Commission.

Relations between Nigeria and China have expanded on growing bilateral trade and strategic cooperation. China is considered one of Nigeria's closest allies and partners. China is also one of Nigeria's important trading and export partners. According to a 2014 BBC World Service Poll, 80% of Nigerians view China's influence positively, with only 10% expressing a negative view, making Nigeria the most pro-Chinese nation in the world. 2014 World Service Poll BBC Although Nigeria maintains trade relations with Taiwan, and has a representative office in Taipei, it issued a joint communiqu√© with China in 2005, reaffirming that Beijing was \\"the only legitimate government representing the whole of China and Taiwan is an unalienable part of its territory\\".China and Africa: A Century of Engagement, David H. Shinn, Joshua Eisenman, University of Pennsylvania Press, 10 Jul 2012, page 87 Development of bilateral relations Nigeria and the People's Republic of China established formal diplomatic relations on February 10, 1971. Relations between the two nations grew closer as a result of the international isolation and Western condemnation of Nigeria's military dictatorships (1970s-1998). Nigeria has since become an important source of oil and petroleum for China's rapidly growing economy and Nigeria is looking to China for help in achieving high economic growth; China has provided extensive economic, military and political support. In 2004 and again in 2006, Chinese President Hu Jintao made state visits to Nigeria and addressed a joint session of the National Assembly of Nigeria. Both nations signed a memorandum of understanding on establishing a strategic partnership. China has supported Nigeria's bid for a seat in the U.N. Security Council. As of February 2013, the Chinese Ambassador in Nigeria is Deng Boqing. Strategic cooperation In response to the hesitation of the United States and other Western countries to aid Nigeria in their efforts to combat insurgents in the oil-rich Niger Delta region, the Nigerian government has developed close military cooperation with China, which has supplied arms, equipment, training and technology to the Nigerian armed forces. Both nations also signed a US$311 million agreement to develop cooperation in communications and space programs; China helped develop and launch the Nigerian communications satellite (NigComSat-1) by 2007 to expand cellular and internet networks in Central Africa. Commerce Countries which signed cooperation documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative Bilateral trade reached US$3 billion in 2006 ‚Äì up from $384 million in 1998. During Chinese President Hu Jintao's visit in 2006, China secured four oil drilling licenses and agreed to invest $4 billion in oil and infrastructure development projects in Nigeria, and both nations agreed to a four-point plan to improve bilateral relations ‚Äì a key component of which was to expand trade and investments in agriculture, telecommunications, energy and infrastructure development. Furthermore, China agreed to buy a controlling stake in the Kaduna oil refinery that would produce . Nigeria also promised to give preference to Chinese oil firms for contracts for oil exploration in the Niger Delta and Chad Basin. In 2006, China also agreed to grant a loan of $1 billion to Nigeria to help it upgrade and modernize its railway networks. In 2005 Nigeria agreed to supply PetroChina with of oil for $800 million. In 2006 the CNOOC purchased a share for $2.3 billion in an oil exploration block owned by a former defence minister. China has also pledged to invest $267 million to build the Lekki free trade zone near Lagos. However, the \\"flooding\\" of Nigerian markets with cheap Chinese goods has become a sensitive political issue, as ‚Äì combined with the importation of second-hand European products ‚Äì it has adversely affected domestic industries, especially in textiles, and led to closure of 65 textile mills and the laying-off of 150,000 textile workers over the course of a decade. Nigerian militants have also threatened to attack Chinese workers and projects in the Niger Delta. In 2010, trade between the two countries was worth US$7.8 billion. In 2011 Nigeria was the 4th largest trading partner of China in Africa and in the first 8 months of 2012 it was the 3rd. Chinese development finance to Nigeria From 2000 to 2011, there are approximately 40 Chinese official development finance projects identified in Nigeria through various media reports.Austin Strange, Bradley C. Parks, Michael J. Tierney, Andreas Fuchs, Axel Dreher, and Vijaya Ramachandran. 2013. China‚Äôs Development Finance to Africa: A Media-Based Approach to Data Collection. CGD Working Paper 323. Washington DC: Center for Global Development.http://china.aiddata.org These projects range from a $2.5 billion loan for Nigerian rail, power, or telecommunications projects in 2008,< to an MoU for $1 billion construction of houses and water supply in Abuja in 2009, and several rail networks.Strange, Parks, Tierney, Fuchs, Dreher, and Ramachandran, China‚Äôs Development Finance to Africa: A Media-Based Approach to Data Collection.http://aiddatachina.org/projects/1851 Since 2000, trade relations have risen exponentially. There has been an increase in total trade of over 10,384 million dollars between the two nations from 2000 to 2016.LeVan, Carl; Ukata, Patrick (2018). The Oxford Handbook of Nigerian Politics. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 751. However the structure of the Sino-Nigerian trade relationship has become a major political issue because Chinese exports accounted for around 80 percent of total bilateral trade volumes. This has resulted in a serious trade imbalance with Nigeria importing ten times more than it exports to Chin Nigeria's economy is becoming over-reliant on cheap foreign imports to sustain itself resulting in a clear decline in Nigerian Industry under such arrangements.LeVan, p. 754-756.

The wealth of the Abbey was based on banking, as much as land ownership. The abbey played an important role in the development of German settlements in the area, as the first villages of German-speaking inhabitants were founded close to the abbey.

The cremation facilities, the only ones built inside a concentration camp in Italy, were installed by Erwin Lambert, and were destroyed before the camp was liberated. Today, the former concentration camp operates as a civic museum. Background The building was erected in 1913 and first used as a rice- husking facility (hence the name \\"Risiera\\"). During World War II, German occupation forces in Trieste used the building to transport, detain and exterminate prisoners. Many occupants of Risiera di San Sabba were transported to the German Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau in Occupied Poland. Historians estimate that over 3,000 people were killed at the Risiera camp and thousands more imprisoned and transported elsewhere. The majority of prisoners came from Friuli, the Julian March and the Province of Ljubljana. Boris Pahor was also held at the camp before being transported to the concentration camps of Dachau and Natzweiler-Struthof. After the war, the camp served as a refugee camp and transit point in the 1950s, where many people, especially ethnic Italians fled Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

He was assaulted by a group of on-duty police officers after being arrested for disorderly conduct at a bar in Houston's Mexican-American East End neighborhood. The officers convicted for the death of Torres, at the state level, received minimal sentencing; 1 year probation and a $1 fine. Torres' murder and sentencing sparked community outrage and lead to multiple community protests, with one gathering escalating to a riot. His death lead to advocacy based and HPD official's negotiations leading to the addition of policies addressing racial relations. After Torres' arrest at the bar, the officers took him to the city jail for booking. But, he was struck so brutally that authorities refused to book him into the jail. Instead, the police officers were ordered, by a supervisor, to take Torres to a local hospital for immediate medical treatment. The officers did not comply with the supervisor's order. Three days later, on Mother's Day, Sunday, May 8, 1977 his dead body was found severely beaten and floating in the Buffalo Bayou, a creek on the outskirts of downtown Houston. Terry W. Denson and Steven Orlando two of the arresting officers were charged with murder following the discovery of Torres' body. Three other officers were fired from the HPD by Police Chief B.G. Bond, but no criminal charges were brought against the fired officers. A rookie officer who was present at the scenes of Torres' torture and drowning was a key witness for the prosecution. Denson and Orlando were convicted for Torres' death and found guilty of negligent homicide (a misdemeanor), sentenced to one year of probation and a one dollar fine. The all white jury, minimized criminal convictions, and sentencing sparked community outrage leading to multiple protests and the 1978 Moody Park Riot. The investigation of Torres' murder proved controversial. Following the State of Texas convictions of the two former officers, the Torres case was reviewed at the federal level by the U.S. Department of Justice. Which led to three of the officer's federal convictions, for violating Torres' civil rights. Torres' murder generated significant newspaper articles across the United States, while national televised mainstream media has no history of 'special' reports nor any episodes reporting the circumstances leading to his murder. Newspaper outlets initially focusing on his assault and drowning soon turned their attention to the historic racism, lack of HPD over watch and the reoccurring absence of state and federal investigations. Torres' murder lead to a locally produced, 30-40 minute documentary entitled The Case of Joe Campos Torres revealing the murderous event and the repeated history of police misconduct in Houston. The year following his death, a poetic song by vocalist and activist Gil Scott- Heron, titled \\"Poem for Jos√© Campos Torres\\" was created reflecting the struggles of racism and police criminal actions. Background Torres was born in a Houston barrio to a family of Mexican descent, and was raised within poverty. Unfortunately, he only achieved an eighth-grade education level. It is believed a side effect of the poverty he experienced led to his constant struggle with his social demeanor. According to family and friends, his dream was to run and own a karate school. He wanted to open the school near his East End Houston neighborhood, allowing him to teach young ones the art of self- defense. To pursue his dream, he realized that he needed a General Education Diploma (GED), a driver's license and a job as a lineman with a telephone company. Richard Vargas, Torres' longtime friend, said that when Torres was 23 he was still lost emotionally and was fighting a sporadic problem with alcohol. Torres would occasionally become very intoxicated; friends and family say this would trigger his aggression, in wanting to fight. Torres' younger brothers, Gilbert, 20 and Ray, 16 acknowledged that Torres had an occasional problem with alcohol abuse. \\"Alcohol really got to him sometimes.\\" Vargas said, \\"Sometimes when he drank a lot he wanted to fight ... I didn't like to be around Joe when he was drinking. When he got drunk, he'd start practicing his karate. He'd yell and kick and punch at the air.\\" When Torres was a teenager he got into a lot of fights, but had confided with Vargas and told him he knew the fighting would not get him anywhere. Torres' father, Jos√© Luna Torres Jr., 46, said his son spent two years in the United States Army (U.S. Army). During his military service, he was accepted and undergoing Army Ranger training at Fort Bragg North Carolina. While in ranger training, he was separated from the service in September 1976, under a 'general discharge.' It is reported his abuse of alcohol and anger outbursts are what ultimately led to his early release from the U.S. Army. His brother Gilbert said, \\"Before the service, Joe was bum and a drifter, but after he got out he really cut down on the drinking ... The normal Joe was different from the drunk Joe.\\" He said, \\"The drunk Joe got rowdy easy and he [take] things the wrong way sometimes.\\" Just two weeks before his death, Torres found employment as a glass contractor earning $2.75 an hour. Vargas said, Torres had difficulty staying employed since his discharge from the U.S. Army. He said Torres resented his restriction to tedious, low paying jobs due to his low education level and nominal military skills. Even though Torres had received, while in the military, training as a telecommunication's lineman not having his GED and a driver's license were barriers to employment with a potential telecommunications provider. Vargas said, Torres' true passions were physical fitness and the art of karate. After his return from the U.S. Army he was working to receive a black belt (expert) rating in karate. In addition to his progress in karate, he also under went weight training and jogged, frequently attaching weights to his feet. Incident Torres had been arrested for disorderly conduct at a bar in Houston's predominantly Hispanic East End neighborhood. The six police officers who responded took Torres to a spot called \\"The Hole\\" next to the Buffalo Bayou and beat him. The officers then took Torres to the city jail, who refused to process him due to his injuries. They were ordered to take him to Ben Taub Hospital, but instead of doing so, the officers took him back to the banks of Buffalo Bayou and pushed him into the water. Torres's body was found two days later. Trials Officers Terry W. Denson and Steven Orlando were tried on state murder charges. They were convicted of negligent homicide and received one year of probation and a $1 fine. Denson, Orlando and fired officer Joseph Janish were later convicted of federal civil rights violations in 1978, and served nine months in prison. Moody Park Riot On the one year anniversary of Jos√© Campos Torres' murder a riot was started at Moody Park located in Houston's Near Northside neighborhood. The riot broke out on the evening of Saturday, May 7, 1978 at approximately 7:30 pm, once a fiesta event ended at the park. Between five and six thousand people attended the celebration. Police arrived at the park in response to a call for an incident of disorderly conduct. It remains unclear on how the riot started. Some reports reflect that the officers were making a few arrests and this is when people in the event began yelling, \\"No you are not taking them\\" and \\"You'll kill them the way you killed Jos√© Campos Torres\\". The crowd's initial yelling immediately lead people to begin chanting in unison \\"Justice for Joe Torres\\" \\"Viva Joe Torres\\" and \\"A Chicano's life is worth more than a dollar!\\" The crowd then began throwing bottles and rocks at the officers. The Fulton Village shopping center's stores at 2900 Fulton street, were looted and set on fire. Abe Weiner, an owner of a department store in the shopping center, said it took the fire department over an hour to respond to his emergency 9-1-1 call for help. Three large buildings and two smaller ones in the shopping center were looted and stripped by fires. The rioting escalated to over a area adjacent to Moody Park. A total of six stores and one gasoline station were set on fire. Officers were promptly deployed in riot gear to try and control the gathering of approximately 1,500 people according to police (other estimates reflect 150-300) who took part in the riot. Some rioters had flipped cars over and set them on fire, fourteen of the eighteen smashed and burned cars were police cars. The property damage of businesses and police vehicles reached $500,000. At least 28 people were taken into custody after the violence started in the predominantly Mexican-American neighborhood. The incident and all the fires were finally under control at 3:00 am. Houston police officer Tommy A. Britt suffered a broken leg when hit by a car while trying to close off one of the streets involved in the riot. The driver Rogelio Castillo did not pull over, but was apprehended a few blocks away from the incident.KPRC-TV The first news reporters to arrive at the scene were KPRC-TV reporter Jack Cato, and reporter/photographer Phil Archer. Both were beaten and stabbed. Cato suffered a punctured lung from a stab wound in the lower back. Archer was hit in the face with a brick and then stabbed in the left hip while lying unconscious on the pavement. Rioters attempted to smash the camera he was carrying. It was later recovered, badly damaged. Cato managed to bring out the video shot during the attack which shows some of the rioters surrounding a burning Houston Fire Department ambulance supervisor's car. The riot's violence left a total of five police officers, two news personnel and eight rioters injured and hospitalized. None of the fifteen hospitalized people died due to their injuries. Popular cultureBooks= Author Dwight Watson dedicated the chapter \\"The Storm Clouds of Change: The Death of Jos√© Campos Torres and the Emergence of Triracial Politics in Houston\\" in the book Race and the Houston Police Department, 1930‚Äì1990 A Change Did Come. The chapter covers the impact of Torres' murder on society and changes in Houston's policing policies. =Music= Poem for Jos√© Campos Torres Vocalist and activist Gil Scott-Heron, known as the \\"Godfather of Rap\\" and for his sociology charged spoken word performances in the '70s. Scott-Heron's best-known recording is the 1971 released \\"The Revolution Will Not be Televised\\", this artwork characterizes unashamed consumerism. Scott-Heron's artistry based on self- fortitude and resentment of racism spanned across racial cultures and was popular among both African-Americans and Latinos. In 1978, the year following Torres' murder, he targeted community awareness of the murder and created a poetic song focusing on America's systemic abuse of Asian-Americans, African- Americans and Hispanics in the heartfelt \\"Poem for Jos√© Campos Torres.\\" The song was released as track 4 of the album titled; The Mind of Gil Scott-Heron. Scott-Heron saw Torres as a brother and made his familial tie to Torres in the lyrics, here is a quote from the song: El Ballad De Jos√© Campos Torres Charanga Cakewalk is the stage name for Michael Ramos, a self-described Latino Chicano Mexican who is also a citizen of the world. Ramos, from Austin, TX, is an instrumental artist who passes a distinguishing sound of Latino music onto the next generation of artistry. Ramos has played numerous instruments in studios and on-tours for John Mellencamp, Patty Griffin, Los Lonely Boys, Paul Simon and multiple notable artist. His artwork is self-styled as Cumbia-Tronic that soars between absorbed Electronic Dance and cultivated genres of Cumbia, Ranchera, Folklorica, and Garage Rock. In March 2006, Charanga Cakewalk released the album Chicano Zen. The album has multiple instrumental songs, track 11 the closing song is the instrumental titled: \\"El Ballad de Jos√© Campos Torres\\", with a synth, accordion and piano drift inspired by the life of Torres: Moody Park Riot (Jos√© Campos Torres) In 2014 Nu√±o Records published, via SoundCloud, the song \\"Moody Park Riot (Jos√© Campos Torres)\\" written by Juan Nu√±o performed by Jesse James at Houston, TX. The lyrics depict Torres' beating and drowning along with events tied to the 1978 Moody Park Riot. =Television= Interview with Janie Torres Art Browning hosted a television interview with Torres' little sister Janie Torres. The episode, produced by Green Watch Television (GWTV), is titled: \\"Joe Campos Torres, 40 years ago\\", first aired: Wednesday, April 26, 2017, duration: 24 min. When Browning asked about her thoughts on the establishment of Black Lives Matter she replied: At the closing of the interview, Janie Torres, who was only a when her brother's life was taken, announced plans for an annual solidarity walk in memory of her brother. The walk is targeted across all generations with the focus on awareness of police racism across the nation. The second annual walk and rally occurred on May 6, 2017 in Houston, Texas. Janie plans on continuing to hold the walks annually, to be held on the yearly anniversaries of her brother's murder. For social awareness she has posted the walk on a Facebook homepage; \\"Joe Campos Torres Solidarity Walk For Past & Future Generations\\". =Films= The Case of Joe Campos Torres The documentary The Case of Joe Campos Torres recounts the calendar of events and ensuing community-protest assemblies, community/police department discussions, along with the legal actions taken by the Torres family against the Houston Police Department and the City of Houston. Filmed around Houston, the documentary records the Latino communities reaction to what they witnessed as an act of racial injustice against their population. The documentary, approximately 30 ‚Äì 40 minutes in length, replays raw footage taken from local news station's archives. The footage is used as a reminder to viewers that before video cameras were able to bring police misconduct to light, the family of Torres had to rely on community support to help them find justice. The film was produced in 1977 by Tony Bruni and Houston's KPRC-TV, Channel 2. Carlos Calbillo both wrote and edited the film and it was reported by John Qui√±ones, who is now with ABC News and hosts the series What Would You Do?.

It aired between 4 June 2008 and 15 November 2008. Background ITV had introduced ITV Play to some criticism, attracting significant negative publicity for the group, initially for the perceived poor quality of the shows provided. More criticism was to come when several British TV companies were caught up in a series of scandals related to the manipulation of phone-in quizzes, and the significant revenues generated from Premium rate telephone numbers. Following investigation by UK regulator Ofcom, the ITV Play channel was axed shortly afterwards but with programmes retained on the ITV Network after midnight. It was announced on 12 September 2007 that ITV was to close the ITV Play brand and its shows on the ITV Network 'by the end of 2007'. The final edition of Glitterball was broadcast on 30 September 2007. Make Your Play was then extended to 6 nights a week, until the closure of the brand on 23 December 2007. ITV Play on digital channel ITV2 ended at the start of November 2007. The ITV Play website was renamed as ITV Games in September 2007, with the ITV Play brand only used for itv.com's Bingo, Casino and Poker websites. Having introduced a documentary series Nightwatch with Steve Scott to fill the slot, ITV advertisers wanted a return to a more youth- oriented game show format. Format Bingo Night Live was a simple and free bingo game, split into: *Four (originally three) games of bingo (green, orange, blue and - added later - purple cards). Prizes were given for: **One line **Two lines **A \\"Golden Jackpot\\" prize, starting at ¬£25,000 on launch night, given for a full card with less than 32 numbers called **A full ticket ('Full House') The show originally aired five times per week (Tuesday to Saturday), and were presented by a total of three presenters: *a game caller (Anthony Crank, Michael Underwood or Mike Toolan) *a statistician (Nichola Dixon) *a supporting presenter for the phone-in segments of the show (Melinda Messenger or Jenny Powell) Before play started, UK astrologer Russell Grant gave a pre-recorded view of the players' possibilities of winning according to their astrological sign. At moments during each bingo game, the game was stopped and statistician controller Nichola Dixon provided player statistics, lucky star signs, facts and figures, based on live data of players active during that specific show. Each of the first two games were followed by phone- in interactive games, initially fronted by Melinda Messenger. These provided additional cash prizes to be won, with normally two extra games played, such as \\"Magic Numbers\\" and \\"Minute to Win It\\". Later, this was reduced to one phone-in game. After her departure, Jenny Powell replaced Messenger as hostess of this part of the show, until Powell's absence through pregnancy led to Nichola Dixon being required to cover. This meant that occasionally there were only two presenters for the whole programme. On 30 August 2008, it was announced a fourth game of Bingo (the purple game) would be introduced, to compensate for the reduction in the number of shows from five to three per week. \\"Minute to Win It\\" was removed, though the \\"Magic Number\\" game remained. New segments such as \\"Movie Reviews\\" were introduced. The podium from where the phone-in games were played was moved closer to statistician's desk, meaning that only two presenters were required. The section of the stage where all three presenters had stood at the start of each show was removed. On 2 October 2008, it was announced that the Golden Jackpot bonus, which had been increasing by ¬£500 since launch night without being won, would be given away on 10 October 2008 to the winner of a full house on the final game, provided it was not won through the normal rules before that point. The amount guaranteed to be given away was ¬£60,000. On the night, Michael from Margate won a total of ¬£60,500 on the blue game, the winning prize including the full house win of ¬£500 plus the jackpot of ¬£60,000. At the end of the show, it was announced by an official adjudicator of the Guinness Book of World Records that the Bingo Night Live players had made a world record for the world‚Äôs largest online bingo game, and that every valid player involved in the show would get their own Guinness World Record certificate. On 19 October 2008, the \\"Minute To Win It\\" phone-in game returned each Saturday, giving magic number winners from Wednesday, Thursday and Friday the chance of a ¬£500 win. From this point, the show increased to four nights per week (Wednesday to Saturday). Additionally, the purple bingo game was turned into a turbo round where there was no one-line or two-line win, only the full house win with a chance of the golden jackpot. The numbers were read out at twice the normal speed, accompanied by a faster remix of the original background music. On 8 November 2008, it was announced that Bingo Night Live would be coming to an end, with the final show being aired on 15 November 2008. During the show on 14 November 2008, it was announced that - as with the show on 10 October 2008 - the Golden Jackpot would be won again on the final show, if not won beforehand. Mike Toolan and Jayne Sharp were the presenters of the final show, during which it was announced that over the 6 months of broadcasting, prizes totalling ¬£500,000 had been won by 15,000 winners. Production The show was produced in a one-hour format by A2 Media Group on behalf of ITV, with the first show televised from 4 June 2008. The programme was broadcast from the studios of Granada Television in Manchester. The registration service and the actual game was technically run by partner The Gaming Channel, a division of Mirada plc, via its subsidiary Gaming Channel Bookmakers Ltd which was licensed to run the game by the UK Gaming Commission. Participants could then either play by printing out their cards and playing in standard \\"dobbing\\" format with a pen; online live where the computer marks their card in front of them; or online automatically, whereby the participant did not need to watch the show. ITV plc claimed that Bingo Night Live boasted the biggest Bingo set on television ‚Äì \\"all designed to give viewers all the entertainment, tension and drama you'd expect from a great game of Bingo ‚Äì but all in the comfort of your own home.\\" The numbers drawn during each game show up on the large \\"Wall of Numbers\\" and were marked as they are called by the presenter. The game was stopped as both participants won the various prizes, as well as to increase player tension when statistician controller Dixon showed player statistics, lucky star signs, facts and figures. CriticismSTV= Bingo Night Live was not broadcast on STV (the ITV broadcaster in northern and central Scotland), reportedly owing to a dispute over costs and associated advertising revenues. However, viewers in the two STV regions (STV North and STV Central) could view the show through Sky Digital on the ITV London AD feed, on Virgin Media on the ITV audio description service, or online at itv.com. =Technical breakdowns= Bingo Night Live was ITV's first interactive televised/web programme. At launch there were various problems with the reliability of the web interface. On 17 July 2008 Bingo Night Live was not shown due to a power cut in the Greater Manchester area. The show was replaced with re-runs of Creature Comforts and TV's Naughtiest Blunders. An email explaining the fault was sent to all players telling them \\"You do not need to do anything further; your cards will be automatically carried across to tonight‚Äôs show and entered into the next games\\". Further technical problems were encountered on 26 October 2008 where the second game of the show ran into difficulties after the second number was called. The game was abandoned whilst on air, although it continued to run via the Bingo Night Live website. The show was temporarily replaced with a rerun of Creature Comforts while the problems were resolved, before coming back on air for the two remaining games of the night.

Its bishop has been Iosif PƒÉule»õ since 2019. Between 1990 and 2019 its bishop was Petru Gherghel, previously Apostolic Administrator since 1978. Auxiliary Bishop since 1999 has been Aurel PercƒÉ, Titular Bishop of Mauriana, appointed Archbishop of Bucharest in 2019.  History  It was established in 1818 as the Apostolic Vicariate of Moldavia (a pre-diocesan missionary jurisdiction; exempt, i.e. directly subject to the Holy See, not part of an ecclesiastical province, but entitled to a titular bishop), on territory split off from the suppressed Diocese of BacƒÉu, which had originally been set up at Siret by Pope Urban V in 1370, due to work done by Franciscans and Dominicans; its seat was transferred to BacƒÉu at the beginning of the 15th century. Abandoned in 1497 due to Muslim persecutions, the See of BacƒÉu was re-established in 1611, and had a succession of twenty prelates until 1789, when it was suppressed. The Catholics of Moldavia were then placed under the spiritual direction of Apostolic prefects, generally chosen from the Conventuals in charge of the mission. The Apostolic Vicariate of Moldavia was promoted on 27 June 1884 by Pope Leo XIII to Diocese of Ia≈üi (J√°szv√°s√°r in Hungarian) covering Romanian Moldavia, with Ia≈üi as residence. In 1921 it gained territory from the Diocese of Tiraspol. On 5 June 1930 it gained territory from the Ukrainian Latin Metropolitan Archdiocese of Lviv. On 28 October 1993, it lost territory to establish the Apostolic Administration of Moldova (now the diocese of Chi»ôinƒÉu).  Special churches  Its Cathedral see is the Our Lady Queen of Ia»ôi Cathedral, in Ia≈üi, where it also has the former cathedral: the Assumption of Mary Church. Other former cathedrals are the Biserica de vizitarea Maicii Domnului, in BacƒÉu, and the ruined Biserica de Maicii Domnului, in Baia. A Minor Basilica is the Bazilica Minora Sanctuarul de la Cacica, in Cacica.  Extent and statistics  As per 2014 its pastorally served 232,132 Catholics (5.3% of 4,359,762 total) on 46,378 km¬≤ in 149 parishes, 420 priests (297 diocesan, 123 religious) with 704 lay religious (282 brothers, 422 sisters) and 125 seminarians. The diocese covers the Romanian region of Moldavia--the counties of Suceava, Boto≈üani, Neam≈£, Ia≈üi, BacƒÉu, Vaslui, Vrancea and Gala≈£i. 5.2% of the inhabitants are Roman Catholic, with concentrations around BacƒÉu and Roman. Its adherents are predominantly ethnic Romanians, with small Cs√°ng√≥s (old Hungarian dialect) and Polish communities.

It is indicated for use in conjunction with castration in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). It is taken by mouth. Side effects of enzalutamide when added to castration include asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, arthralgia, and hot flashes. Rarely, it can cause seizures. It has a high potential for drug interactions. Enzalutamide is an antiandrogen, and acts as an antagonist of the androgen receptor, the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. In doing so, it prevents the effects of these hormones in the prostate gland and elsewhere in the body. Enzalutamide was first described in 2006, and was introduced for the treatment of prostate cancer in 2012. It was the first second-generation NSAA to be introduced. The medication is available throughout the world. Medical usesProstate cancer= Enzalutamide is clinically effective in the treatment of mCRPC. An up to 89% decrease in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels have been reported after a month of taking the drug. PSA level decreased more than 50% in 40 of 65 chemo-naive patients and 38 of 75 chemotherapy-treated patients. Median time to radiographic progression was 56 weeks for chemo-naive patients and 25 weeks for the post-chemotherapy population. Medivation, the developer of enzalutamide, conducted an international phase III trial that began in September 2009 known as AFFIRM. The aim of this trial was determine the safety and effectiveness of enzalutamide in patients who have previously failed chemotherapy treatment with docetaxel. In November 2011, this trial was stopped early after an interim analysis revealed that patients given the drug lived for approximately 5 months longer than those taking placebo. FDA approval was granted in August 2012. Another phase III trial known as PREVAIL is investigating the effectiveness of enzalutamide with patients who have not yet received chemotherapy. On October 22, 2013, Medivation and Astellas announced that the PREVAIL trial met both co-primary endpoints of overall survival, with a 30% reduction in the risk of death compared with placebo (hazard ratio = 0.7; 95% confidence interval, range of 0.59‚Äì0.83), and radiographic progression-free survival, with an 81% reduction in risk of radiographic progression or death compared with placebo (hazard ratio = 0.19); 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.23). In addition, a phase II trial began in March 2011 comparing enzalutamide with bicalutamide in prostate cancer patients who have progressed while on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue therapy (e.g., leuprorelin) or surgical castration. Addition of Enzalutamide with testosterone suppression in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer showed better survival compared to standard nonsteroidal antiandrogen therapy. =Other uses= Enzalutamide can be used as an antiandrogen in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women. =Available forms= Enzalutamide is provided in the form of 40 mg Capsule. It is taken orally at a dosage of 160 mg once per day (four capsules). Contraindications Enzalutamide is contraindicated in women during pregnancy. It may cause fetal harm. Side effects Notable side effects of enzalutamide seen in clinical trials have included gynecomastia, breast pain/tenderness, fatigue, diarrhea, hot flashes, headache, sexual dysfunction, and, less commonly, seizures. Other \\"common\\" side effects reported in clinical trials have included neutropenia, visual hallucinations, anxiety, cognitive disorder, memory impairment, hypertension, dry skin, and pruritus (itching). Enzalutamide monotherapy is regarded as having a moderate negative effect on sexual function and activity, significantly less than that of GnRH analogues but similar to that of other NSAAs such as bicalutamide. =Central adverse effects= Seizures have occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated with enzalutamide in clinical trials. This is thought to be due to enzalutamide crossing the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and exerting off-target binding to and inhibition of the GABAA receptor in the central nervous system (it has been found to inhibit the GABAA receptor in vitro ( = 3.6 ŒºM) and induces convulsions in animals at high doses). In addition to seizures, other potentially GABAA receptor-related side effects observed with enzalutamide treatment in clinical trials have included anxiety, insomnia, vertigo, paresthesia, and headache. Due to its ability to lower the seizure threshold, patients with known seizure disorders or brain injury should be closely monitored during enzalutamide treatment. NSAA-induced seizures are responsive to benzodiazepine treatment, and it has been suggested that GABAA receptor inhibition by enzalutamide could be treated with these drugs. In dose-ranging studies, severe fatigue was observed with enzalutamide at doses of 240 mg/day and above. =Rare adverse reactions= There is a single case report of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) with enzalutamide treatment. The mechanism of action of the side effect is unknown, but it was proposed to a consequence of inhibition of the GABAA receptor by enzalutamide. Overdose Enzalutamide may cause seizures in overdose. Interactions Enzalutamide is a moderate to strong inducer of multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 and hence has a high potential for clinically relevant drug interactions. Circulating concentrations of enzalutamide may be altered by inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, and should be avoided if possible. In a clinical study of enzalutamide for -positive breast cancer in women, enzalutamide was found to decrease serum concentrations of the aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and exemestane by 90% and 50%, respectively, which could reduce their effectiveness. PharmacologyPharmacodynamics= Enzalutamide acts as a selective silent antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Unlike the first- generation NSAA bicalutamide, enzalutamide does not promote translocation of AR to the cell nucleus and in addition prevents binding of AR to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and AR to coactivator proteins. As such, it has been described as an AR signaling inhibitor in addition to antagonist. The drug is described as a \\"second-generation\\" NSAA because it has greatly increased efficacy as an antiandrogen relative to so-called \\"first-generation\\" NSAAs like flutamide and bicalutamide. The drug has only 2-fold lower affinity for the AR than DHT, the endogenous ligand of the AR in the prostate gland. When LNCaP cells (a prostate cancer cell line) engineered to express elevated levels of AR (as found in patients with advanced prostate cancer) were treated with enzalutamide, the expression of androgen-dependent genes PSA and TMPRSS2 was down regulated in contrast to bicalutamide where the expression was upregulated. In VCaP cells which over-express the AR, enzalutamide induced apoptosis whereas bicalutamide did not. Furthermore, enzalutamide behaves as an antagonist of the W741C mutant AR in contrast to bicalutamide which behaves as a pure agonist when bound to the W741C mutant. Dose-ranging studies of enzalutamide in men with prostate cancer have been performed. Changes in hormone levels Enzalutamide monotherapy at a dosage of 160 mg/day has been found to increase circulating levels of testosterone by 114.3%, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 51.7%, estradiol by 71.7%, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) by 100.6%, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) by 9.6%, androstenedione by 51.1%, luteinizing hormone (LH) by 184.7%, follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) by 47.0%, and prolactin by 16.8%. These changes in hormone levels are similar to those with high-dose bicalutamide monotherapy. The median maximum decrease in levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels was 99.6%. Comparison with other antiandrogens Enzalutamide has approximately 8-fold higher binding affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) compared to bicalutamide. One study found an of 21 nM for enzalutamide and 160 nM for bicalutamide at the AR in the LNCaP cell line (7.6-fold difference), while another found respective IC50 values of 36 nM and 159 nM (4.4-fold difference). In accordance, clinical findings suggest that enzalutamide is a significantly more potent and effective antiandrogen in comparison to first- generation NSAAs such as bicalutamide, flutamide, and nilutamide. Also, unlike with the first-generation NSAAs, there has been no evidence of hepatotoxicity or elevated liver enzymes in association with enzalutamide treatment in clinical trials. Resistance mechanisms in prostate cancer Enzalutamide is only effective for a certain period of time, after that the growth of the cancer is not inhibited by this antiandrogen. The mechanisms of resistance to Enzalutamide are being intensively studied. Currently, several mechanisms have been found: * AR mutations * AR splice variants * Glucocorticoid receptor bypass * Increase in flux of glycolysis * Autophagy mediated resistance * Wnt signaling activation * Increase in intra-tumoral androgen biosynthesis mediated by AKR1C3 enzyme * Interleukin 6 signaling mediated resistance Cytochrome P450 modulation Enzalutamide is reported to be a strong inducer of the enzyme CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, and can affect the circulating concentrations of drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. =Pharmacokinetics= The bioavailability of enzalutamide in humans is unknown, but is at least 84.6% based on the amount recovered from urine and bile in excretion studies. Similarly, the bioavailability of enzalutamide in rats is 89.7%. Steady-state concentrations of enzalutamide are achieved within 28 days of treatment initiation. The plasma protein binding of enzalutamide is 97 to 98%, while that of N-desmethylenzalutamide (NDME), its major metabolite, is 95%. Enzalutamide is primarily bound to albumin. The medication is metabolized in the liver, mainly by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. CYP2C8 is primarily responsible for the formation of NDME. Enzalutamide has a long elimination half-life of 5.8 days on average, with a range of 2.8 to 10.2 days. The elimination half-life of NDME is even longer, at about 7.8 to 8.6 days. Enzalutamide is eliminated 71.0% in urine, 13.6% in bile, and 0.39% in feces. Chemistry Enzalutamide is a synthetic diarylthiohydantoin derivative and is structurally related to the earlier first-generation NSAAs such as flutamide, nilutamide, and bicalutamide as well as to newer second-generation NSAAs like apalutamide and proxalutamide. History Enzalutamide was discovered by Charles Sawyers who is now at Memorial Sloan‚ÄìKettering Cancer Center and Michael Jung at the University of California, Los Angeles. They and their colleagues synthesized and evaluated nearly 200 thiohydantoin derivatives of RU-59063, an analogue of nilutamide, for AR antagonism in human prostate cancer cells, and identified enzalutamide and RD-162 as lead compounds. These compounds were patented in 2006 and described in 2007.Sawyers, C., Jung, M., Chen, C., Ouk, S., Welsbie, D., Tran, C., ... & Yoo, D. (2006). U.S. Patent Application No. 11/433,829. https://www.google.com/patents/US20070004753 Enzalutamide was developed and marketed by Medivation for the treatment of prostate cancer. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mCRPC in the United States in August 2012, and for the treatment of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in July 2018. Enzalutamide was the first new AR antagonist to be approved for the treatment of prostate cancer in over 15 years, following the introduction of the first-generation NSAA bicalutamide in 1995. It was the first second-generation NSAA to be introduced.

The film stars Christopher Plummer as Tolstoy and Helen Mirren as his wife Sofya Tolstaya. The film is about the battle between Sofya and his disciple Vladimir Chertkov for his legacy and the copyright of his works. The film premiered at the 2009 Telluride Film Festival. Plot In 1910, the last year of Leo Tolstoy's life, his disciples, led by Vladimir Chertkov, manoeuvre against his wife, Sofya, for control over Tolstoy's works after his death. The main setting is the Tolstoy country estate of Yasnaya Polyana. Tolstoy and Sofya have had a long, passionate marriage, but his spiritual ideals and asceticism (he is opposed, for example, to private property) are at odds with her more aristocratic and conventionally religious views. Contention focuses on a new will that the \\"Tolstoyans\\" are attempting to persuade him to sign. It would place all of his copyrights into the public domain, supposedly leaving his family without adequate support. The maneuvering is seen through the eyes of Tolstoy's new secretary, Valentin Bulgakov, who finds himself mediating between the two sides. He also has a love affair with one of the Tolstoyans, Masha. Ultimately, Tolstoy signs the new will and travels to an undisclosed location where he can continue his work undisturbed. After his departure, Sofya unsuccessfully attempts suicide. During the journey, Tolstoy falls ill. The film ends with his death near the Astapovo railway station where Sofya is allowed by their daughter to see him just moments before his death. The closing credits state that five years after his death the Russian senate reverted the copyrights of Tolstoy's work to Sofya.

At 1,463 pages, it is the longest Australian work of fiction ever written, and the longest single-volume novel to have been written in the English language.Australian Authors - Xavier Herbert (1901-84) Poor Fellow My Country won the 1976 Miles Franklin Literary Award (for books published in 1975), Australia's most prestigious such award.\\"In Brief : Literature\\", The Canberra Times, 28 April 1976, p3, archived by National Library of Australia, accessed 1 February 2020Miles Franklin Award website, accessed 1 February 2020 It was Herbert's final novel. Plot summary The novel takes place between 1936 and 1942, with a brief epilogue set in 1974, and is set primarily in Australia's Northern Territory. Three social outcasts - Prindy, a half-Indigenous boy; Jeremy, his white grandfather, well-known for his outspoken rants against bigotry and conservatism; and Rifkah, a female Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany - find themselves facing oppression as Australia faces a war and ongoing questions about its place in the world. =Book One: _Terra Australis_ = _Subtitle: \\"Blackman's Idyll Despoiled by White Bullies, Thieves, and Hypocrites\\"_ 1936\\\\. Jeremy Delacy is a middle-aged Anglo-Australian who owns a property, Lily Lagoons, in the Northern Territory. Jeremy is an outspoken critic of Australian government and culture. His views often set him apart from his fellow white Australians, especially on the subject of Australian nationalism, as he rejects Australia's fealty to the British Empire, and on the subject of the treatment of Aboriginal Australians. Jeremy supports land rights and reparations to Aboriginal Australians, as he believes that it is morally and culturally wrong to expect them to \\"integrate\\" with white society and be reliant on welfare and a culture that is not their own. Jeremy's first wife, Rhoda, and his adult sons are pillars of society in the fictional town of Beatrice (modelled on towns such as Katherine). However Jeremy's second wife, Nanago, is Indigenous, and they live a life largely separated from society. Jeremy has a grandson, Prindy, on the cusp of adolescence, whose mother is Indigenous and whose father is Jeremy's son, Martin. Prindy is technically a ward of the state, like all Aboriginal Australians, and is torn between his two cultures. Prindy is not fully accepted by white society, although because of his light skin and his unusual musical abilities he is often seen as a figure of fascination by white people. At the same time, because he has a white father and has not been raised in Aboriginal culture, he is disconnected from this world also. One of the elders of Prindy's tribe, Bobwirridirridi (known as the Pookarakka), takes the boy to initiate him properly into the tribe. But Prindy's mother Nell and her Chinese husband, who believe that white culture is superior for the boy, pursue them into the bush. In the confrontation, Nell's husband is killed and Bobwirridirridi is arrested for the crime. As a result, Nell is placed into an institution for Indigenous women while Prindy is taken by the state and relocated to Port Palmerston, a fictional version of Darwin. Jeremy causes a scene at Bobwirridirridi's trial, complaining that the trial is a farce given that the defendant doesn't speak fluent English and has not been provided with an interpreter. In Palmerston, Prindy bonds with his new schoolmistress, Mrs Alfrieda \\"Alfie\\" Candlemas, although her progressive views on Aboriginal education see her trade blows with many of the locals. Jeremy joins forces with Alfie and her husband Frank to embarrass Lady Rhoda and the other members of conservative white society. Alfie is attracted to Jeremy, and one night she stays at Lily Lagoons with the intention of seducing him. Jeremy rejects her, and it becomes clear that - despite her progressive views - Alfie still regards Indigenous people, such as Jeremy's second wife Nanago, as inferior. Ultimately Alfie leaves the Territory to go back to Sydney, convinced that integration of Aboriginal people has to be the goal, rather than the self- determination which Jeremy believes in. Nell escapes her institution and finds Prindy. The two plan to get back to Jeremy, with the help of two other Indigenous people, Queeny and \\"King George\\", and they undergo a lengthy and dangerous journey. En route, the women realise they have been betrayed by King George. He plans to take Prindy to a secret location in the bush to continue the initiation process. As this is \\"men's business\\", the women are not permitted to be involved. Nell and Queeny do not want Prindy to be initiated into the tribe, as they want him to have the chance of a life in white society, and they track the men. In a violent confrontation, all three adults die, and Prindy wanders alone until he is rescued by an Indian travelling salesman, Ali Barbu, whose young daughter Savitra quickly falls for the boy. =Book Two: _Australia Felix_ = _Subtitle: \\"Whiteman's Ideal Sold Out by Rogues and Fools\\"_ 1938\\\\. Prindy is pursued several times by police sergeant Dinny Cahoon and Eddy McCusky, administrator of the Aboriginal people, both of whom have their own patronising views of the boy's future. He finally ends up in Jeremy's care. Australia agrees to take in thousands of Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany and two of them, Dr. Kurt Hoff and Rebecca \\"Rifkah\\" Rosen arrive in Beatrice. They claim to be there as part of the plan to build a Jewish State in Australia. The pair have suffered horrors at the hands of the Nazis, including forced sterilisation, and Rifkah especially finds herself in love with the Australian landscape and the Aboriginal people. Several men in town, including Jeremy, are forcefully attracted to Rifkah, however she rejects them all, in part because she is sterile and believes that any husband will eventually want children. Rifkah remains at Lily Lagoons where she develops a close relationship with Prindy and Nanago. Alfie comes to visit Lily Lagoons. She has joined a group of Australians called the Free Australia Party (based on the real-life Australia First Movement) who are nationalists who also believe in the White Australia policy and are strongly anti-semitic. Alfie claims to have proof that Kurt and Rifkah are actually members of the Communist Party in Australia to recruit members. Kurt confesses to Jeremy that this is true, and Jeremy's connections smuggle Kurt out of the country to save him. Concerned that Rifkah will be deported, Jeremy's son Clancy plots to marry her, thus giving her Australian citizenship. She explains to Clancy that she does not want to marry him but, one night, a drunken Clancy attempts to rape Rifkah and she flees. She finds herself in open water, being attacked by sharks, and is saved by Father Stephen Glascock, the minister at a mission for Aboriginal Australians on Leopold Island. Robert Menzies becomes Prime Minister of Australia and Aboriginal policy changes. There is now greater fear Prindy will be taken by the state again, so Jeremy arranges to transport him to the island mission also, where the boy and Rifkah can live discreetly out of the public eye. Jeremy heads to Sydney, at Alfie and Frank's invitation, where he is introduced to the men who run the Free Australia Party. The party is a mix of communists and fascists, who believe strongly in the supremacy of white Australians. Despite claiming to be supporters of Jeremy's outspoken views, many of the members are openly racist when they learn that his wife is Indigenous. At a party meeting, Jeremy is invited to speak only to cause uproar by claiming that the movement is fatally flawed. He argues that the movement is racist and conflicted with itself, and that the true Australian spirit has been lost, comparing the group's tactics to Nazism. He argues that the party needs to focus less on bigotry and more on getting seats in government to bring about real positive change. Jeremy is attacked by the mob. This attack is captured in the media but misinterpreted to make Jeremy look like a Nazi sympathiser who was attacked by Australian patriots. Returning home to the Territory, Jeremy spends a night in the bush where he has a strange experience with a seeming hallucination of a black man. Jeremy seeks advice from a local donkey trader, Billy Brew, who advises that this may have been an old Aboriginal tradition from the area of a person's \\"second shade\\", which follows the person through life. Billy Brew suggests that if Jeremy his second shade, he is truly an Australian. =Book Three: _Day of Shame_ = _Subtitle: \\"A Rabble Fled the Test of Nationhood\\"_ World War II begins. Jeremy is dragooned into the military by his old British friend, General Mark Esk, and journeys to Melbourne at the General's request. Esk and Jeremy want to increase Australia's focus on the Asia-Pacific theatre of the war, as they both believe that Menzies has committed the country's troops primarily to fighting in Europe, whose consequences for Australia will be far less dire than the actions of Japan and its allies. However during drinks at the officer's mess, Jeremy meets a General who commanded his brother during the Gallipoli campaign in World War I. Jeremy's brother was killed, and officers agreed that this general was a tyrant who did not care for his men. Jeremy causes such a scene that he is forcibly removed from the army. Esk - who vouched for Jeremy - is sent back to Europe, and dies in combat. In Sydney, Jeremy finds that Alfie is pregnant (with his baby, from his previous visit) and is writing an anti-British propaganda novel, in which loyal Australians bomb the RMS Queen Mary in Sydney Harbour, leading to an uprising in which Australia secedes from the British Empire and the War. At a military parade, Jeremy and Alfie cause a scene and they are brutally beaten by a mob of Australians. Alfie loses her baby and Jeremy is severely injured. He wakes up in hospital with gangrenous testicles, but manages to convince the doctor not to amputate them, and he manages to recover. The pair are put on trial for treason. Their lawyer argues successfully that the pair were only misguided. He manages to claim that Alfie's unfinished book - which is the key piece of evidence - was going to end with the rebels being defeated. Jeremy returns home. In late 1941, Australia's new prime minister, John Curtin, declares the entire Northern portion of the continent to be a Combat Zone, which is to be fought and ceded to the Japanese if necessary during an invasion, so as to protect the rest of the country. All white people are required to move to southern cities, while all Aboriginal people will be rounded up and taken to camps in the bush to keep them safe. Jeremy and Nanago, outraged by this, go separately into hiding in the bush, rather than retreat south. Rifkah, Prindy, and the Indian girl Savitra, are supposed to have been evacuated also, but Father Glascock agrees to hide them at the Mission. During this time, Prindy and Savitra - now teenagers - declare themselves engaged and become sexually active. Rifkah and Father Glascock fall in love also, although they manage to keep it a secret from everyone except a jealous young lay-preacher, David. He wants Rifkah for himself and, when he is rejected, betrays her to the government. The three refugees are captured on board a ship and taken back to Port Palmerston however, just as the ship is pulling in, the town is the victim of an air-raid by Japanese forces. Numerous characters are killed, and the survivors either flee town on tightly-packed trains or resort to rioting and looting. The prisoners in the jail are freed, and Prindy is at last reunited with Bobwirridirridi. The two of them, along with Savitra and Rifkah are rescued by train driver Pat Hannaford, who gets them out on the final train under cover of darkness. The group are reunited with Jeremy in the bush, and are soon joined by Alfie Candlemas and Fergus Ferris, an anthropologist and pilot who has proven a loyal ally to Jeremy. Alfie has fled Sydney, where she was going to be interned as an enemy of the state, and plans on travelling to Portuguese Timor where she will make radio broadcasts back to Australia, trying to convince people that their views on the war are wrong. Alfie's anti- semitic views have intensified, and she is immensely hostile to Rifkah. During a trip to the coast, to be reunited with Father Glascock, the group come across Japanese forces again. Glascock is captured, and Alfie and Fergus engage in an aerial battle with a Japanese seaplane. However their plane blows up during the confrontation, and both are killed. While exploring, Savitra and Prindy come across a group of Aboriginal men conducting secret business. They reject Prindy because he is with his wife. Jeremy attempts to convince the teenagers that they need to be careful. Since Savitra is a woman, she cannot view these rituals, and since she is not Indigenous she will not be entirely trusted by Prindy's people. One night, Bobwirridirridi takes Prindy into the bush, to finally conduct the initiation rituals with members of the tribe. Prindy undergoes a number of trials, including circumcision. Savitra has not listened to advice, and she follows him. She is captured by the members of the tribe and brutally killed as punishment. When the girl does not come back to camp, Jeremy follows. He meets Bobwirridirridi, who tells him not to interfere in Indigenous business. Despite his own professed beliefs in self- determination, Jeremy cannot stop himself from intervening. He arrives at the ritual as Prindy is being attacked by spears and having to fight them off with a boomerang. Jeremy's arrival distracts Prindy, who misses one of the spears and is killed. Jeremy chases the Aboriginal men with his rifle and is ultimately speared by Bobwirridirridi. The two men take Prindy's body to a cave, where Jeremy also dies. Rifkah is the only survivor left, and she joins a nomadic Aboriginal tribe to survive until she is finally reunited with Nanago, and both women survive the war. In an epilogue set in 1974, we learn that after the War, much of the area was bought by corporations and mining trusts, or used for military purposes by the Americans. Although Indigenous Australians are given citizenship and welfare, they continue to be treated as second class citizens. Rifkah ends up marrying Pat Hannaford, who has lost an arm, a leg, and an eye in the War, so she can retain Australian citizenship. They become an outspoken pair on the fringes of society. During a visit by Prince Charles to the area, where he is speaking about conservation, Rifkah raises the issue of Indigenous Australians, and asserts that the only way for them to save their culture is to be given amounts of good land for them to own without qualifications. The Prince is willing to listen, but the mob is angry, and they attack Pat, pushing him into the flooding river. No-one will help him, so Rifkah jumps in after him. Both of them appear to drown, but not before Rifkah notices a formation in the water which looks like Prindy's face. Composition Herbert conceived of the novel as early as 1936 and - after the publication of his first novel, Capricornia (1938) - he applied for a grant from the Commonwealth Literary Fund to write his new novel, then titled Yellow Fellow. By 1940 Herbert was struggling to make progress De Groen 1998, p.120 and Herbert continued with his career, publishing two further novels and an autobiography. In 1964, Herbert returned to the abandoned draft.De Groen 1998, p.208 He drew extensively on his own life experiences and those of interesting people he had met around Australia, especially in the Northern Territory.De Groen 1998, p. 209 and passim Herbert's interest was in portraying the stories of disadvantaged and displaced people, with an especial interest in Aboriginal Australians. His first book, Capricornia, had been deliberately released in the same year (1938) as the country's sesquicentenary, when Aboriginal groups in New South Wales held the first Day of Mourning in protest at colonialism and racist policies by the Australian government.De Groen 1998, p.90-99 By the 1960s, as Herbert wrote Poor Fellow My Country, Aboriginal rights were a key topic in Australia, with a 1967 referendum receiving 90.77% of the vote in favour of recognising Aboriginal Australians in the country's population (they had been excluded in the Constitution of Australia) and raise the expectations of the country as to the welfare of Aboriginal Australians.Australian Parliament House Parliamentary Library, The 1967 Referendum, accessed 1 February 2020 Herbert intended his novel to be a key statement on contemporary Australian politics.De Groen 1998, p.222-235 passim The novel was completed (except for the epilogue) by Boxing Day 1973.De Groen 1998, p.237 Publication Herbert refused to commit to a publisher while writing the novel, enjoying being courted by the major Australian publishing houses. Among those considered were Angus & Robertson, represented by his longtime friend and literary advisor Beatrice Deloitte Davis, whom he rejected due to growing animosity over their usage of the copyright for his earlier novels,De Groen 1998, p.234-235 and the University of Queensland Press, represented by Craig Munro, whom he rejected when Munro gave him honest feedback including suggesting the novel be published in three volumes due to its size.De Groen 1998, p.236-237 In July 1974, Herbert signed a contract with William Collins, Sons.De Groen 1998, p.240 The publication process ran into some troubles when a Jewish project manager, Alan Rein, attempted to point out some inaccuracies with the scenes of Jewish life in the novel, to which Herbert - not Jewish himself - took exception.De Groen 1998, p.241 By the time of the novel's publication, the Australia Council for the Arts had been founded, with rapidly increasing amounts of funding available for Australian artists and writers. On the strength of Herbert's name, Poor Fellow My Country was awarded over $20,000 in subsidies to assist with typing and printing, allowing the novel to be sold at $20 - a low amount for a book weighing more than 4 pounds and containing 1,463 pages. On 16 September 1975, the publisher organised a week of festivities in Sydney to celebrate the release of the novel. Herbert and his wife Sadie attended.De Groen 1998, p. 244 Herbert was 74 when the novel was published, and it secured his financial security for the remainder of his life.De Groen 1998, p.249 In 1980, the novel was translated into Japanese by Professor Michio Ochi in 11 volumes, under the title of Kawais√¥ na watashi no kuni .Index Translationum, accessed 1 February 2020 Reception The book sold 30,000 copies within a year of publication and 70,000 within five years, rendering it a success in Australian literary terms.De Groen 1998, p.245 Australian reviewers were mixed but overall positive.De Groen 1998, p.245-246 The Adelaide Advertiser review was entitled \\"A Passionate Cry for a Land and a People\\", while the Courier-Mail called it a \\"big blockbuster\\". Historian Manning Clark, in the Canberra Times, however, titled his review \\"Artist Turns Angry Prophet\\". The Sydney Morning Herald ran two conflicting reviews: one entitled \\"Compelling Power\\" and the other \\"Foaming River of Prose\\". Much criticism centered on the novel's length, with the reviewer for the Nation Review joking about \\"poor fellow Xavier Herbert's typewriter\\". Reaction to the book was more muted from some of Herbert's fellow writers. Randolph Stow thought that Poor Fellow My Country might be \\"the Australian classic\\" but expressed reservations at the character of Jeremy Delacy, who \\"is a bore on a colossal scale\\", and whom Stow believed to be a mouthpiece for Herbert's views rather than a character.De Groen 1998, p.246 Patrick White, Australia's only Nobel laureate, admitted privately that in spite of the \\"beautiful landscapes\\", he found it full of \\"cartoon dialogue and cartoon characters\\" and would never read the entire novel.De Groen 1998, p.255 The novel won the 1976 Miles Franklin Award, beating Frank Hardy's But the Dead Are Many and Thomas Keneally's Gossip from the Forest.De Groen 1998, p.249 Interpretation Sean Monahan has argued that the book's conclusion serves a double purpose. Despite being the most open-minded white person in the book, Jeremy ultimately cannot leave the Aboriginal people alone at this climactic moment, and his need to \\"follow the logic of the white man's thinking\\" and interfere is what causes the tragedy . Prindy, meanwhile, was defined by Herbert as \\"the symbol of the tragedy of the Australian Dream\\" Monahan 2003, p.310 and his death symbolises the inevitable failure of the Australian nation unless it finds a better way forward for its Indigenous people Monahan 2003, p.258.

Often portraying villains, Marcuse's sinister, hulking countenance was enhanced by a shaven head. Early years Marcuse was born in Seattle, Washington to Margaret and Theodore M. Marcuse, a World War I veteran and co- owner of Klementis-Marcuse, Co., fur retailer. After growing up in San Francisco, he studied dramatic arts at Stanford University and was active in theatrical productions there. Later he received a master's degree in classical literature from Stanford.  Military service  Marcuse served with the Navy during World War II and was awarded a Silver Star, Bronze Star Medal, and a Presidential Unit Citation for his heroism while serving as a lieutenant on the famed submarine USS Tirante. Other officers on board included future Massachusetts governor Endicott Peabody and author Edward L. Beach, Jr., who wrote the submarine classic Run Silent, Run Deep.  Career  Marcuse's love for William Shakespeare's plays led to a desire to act on the stage. He trained under Guthrie McClintic in his theatre company, along with Charlton Heston, and appeared on Broadway with Katharine Cornell, Maurice Evans and others. In 1948-1949, he toured nationally for nine months in a production of Medea. On television he appeared on many series, including The Beverly Hillbillies, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, The Wild Wild West, Have Gun ‚Äì Will Travel, Bonanza, Hogan's Heroes (the 1967 episode \\"The Hostage\\", as General von Heiner, filmed not long before his fatal car accident, first airing two and a half weeks after his death), Batman, Star Trek (episode \\"Catspaw\\", first airing, fittingly, the week of Halloween in 1967, one month before his death), The Time Tunnel, I Spy, The Monkees, Perry Mason, Peter Gunn, The Untouchables, The Twilight Zone episodes \\"The Trade-Ins\\" and \\"To Serve Man\\", and The Man from U.N.C.L.E. episodes \\"The Re-collectors Affair,\\" \\"The Minus-X Affair,\\" and \\"The Pieces of Fate Affair\\". His film career included roles in The Two Little Bears (1961), Hitler (1962, as Julius Streicher), A Tiger Walks (1964), The Cincinnati Kid (1965), Mara of the Wilderness (1965), Harum Scarum (1965), The Last of the Secret Agents?

The song has been recorded by numerous artists and is considered an early jazz standard. Composition Tin Pan Alley songwriters Jean Schwartz and William Jerome began their partnership in 1901, and collaborated successfully for more than a decade. They composed many popular songs together, including million-sellers \\"Mister Dooley\\" and \\"Bedelia\\". \\"Chinatown, My Chinatown\\" is considered their biggest hit, but it did not catch on when they wrote it in 1906, and the musical revue it was added to in 1910, Up and Down Broadway, was not especially successful.Garrett, Struggling to Define a Nation, p. 136. By the time \\"Chinatown, My Chinatown\\" became a national hit in 1915, the two were no longer collaborating. Schwartz incorporated Chinese musical forms into Western music for the melody. The original tempo of the song was slow; later it was adapted to a fox-trot tempo, reflecting the popularity of the dance.Garrett, Struggling to Define a Nation, p. 153. Still later, jazz musicians played the song at a \\"hot jazz\\" tempo.Garrett, Struggling to Define a Nation, p. 121.Magee, The Uncrowned King, p. 100. Recording history \\"Chinatown, My Chinatown\\" has been recorded by numerous artists. Several recordings in late 1914 presaged its popularity in 1915 when the American Quartet with Billy Murray had a number one record on Victor, and Grace Kerns and John Barnes Wells also had a popular recording on Columbia. The same year, Columbia also released a version by Prince's Orchestra,Garrett, Struggling to Define a Nation, p. 126. in a one- step medley with Alabama Jubilee and Sam Ash recorded an abbreviated version of it for the Columbia-affiliated, bargain-priced Little Wonder Records.Hoffman, Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound, p. 96.

Fletcher Henderson, Louis Armstrong, Louis Prima, and Lionel Hampton were among the many jazz artists who recorded this song in the 1930s.Crawford & Magee, Jazz Standards, p. 14.

Built between 1629 and 1641, it is one of the finest extant examples of hybrid Spanish Colonial and Puebloan architectural styles. It was named for Saint Stephen I of Hungary. The church was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970, and and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Description The San Est√©van del Rey Mission Church stands at the northern end of the large plaza that takes up the southern end of the mesa top that houses Sky City, the traditional Acoma pueblo settlement that has been continuously occupied since prehistoric times. It is a large adobe structure, built in a wall and beam construction style. Its main walls are thick at the base, one measuring in thickness, and rise to a height of and a thickness of over . The roof masonry, about six inches of adobe weighing several tons, is supported by large ponderosa pine vigas over which roughly-hewn wooden planks are laid. The interior is finished in gypsum, with an original native painting on the back wall of the sanctuary. Adjacent to the church is a small single-story convento, which served as the domicile for the priest. The mission also had other buildings, but these are in ruins. History Spanish colonial explorers first discovered Acoma in 1540. Spanish colonial authorities took authority over Acoma by force of arms in the 1599 Acoma massacre, making it part of the province of Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico. In 1629 Father Juan Ram√≠rez began construction of the mission, using enslaved Acoma and craftsmen. Materials for the construction were hauled up the steep trails on the sides of the mesa, and the viga beams were transported some from Mount Taylor, the nearest source for such timbers. During the 1680 Pueblo Revolt, the Acoma killed the local priest, but the church survived the uprising, and the Spanish return to power in 1692. The church has undergone relatively minor repairs, in 1799‚Äì1800, 1903, and 1924.

At an executive meeting on October 2, 1903, it was revealed that school President Francis Preston Venable announced that former North Carolina Supreme Court justice William Preston Bynum donated $25,000 to have a gymnasium built in honor of his grandson who was a student at the university and had died due to typhoid fever. Architect Frank P. Milburn drafted plans for the structure, which were then approved by Bynum and the university's Board of Trustees. The building was designed to have a Greek architecture influence and had three stories with an above-ground basement. It originally contained a swimming pool, gymnasium. office spaces, and other rooms for various sports like boxing and fencing. Construction was expected to begin in mid-May, but construction was delayed because the company supplying the bricks were not organized. The building had started construction by June and had various target dates that were pushed back for undisclosed reasons and eventually the building was completed in February 1905. Background and construction On October 2, 1903, during an executive University committee meeting on hosted in Governor Daniel Lindsay Russell's office, school President Francis Preston Venable revealed former North Carolina Supreme Court justice William Preston Bynum donated $25,000 to the school to build a gymnasium. The donation was made in honor of Bynum's late grandson William Preston Bynum Jr. who died on vacation after becoming sick with typhoid fever before the close of his sophomore year after attending between 1889 and 1890. The building was officially announced by Dr. Eben Alexander to students in the chapel the same day to \\"vigorous and prolonged applause.\\" The University had expressed desire before Bynum's donation about needing a gymnasium for faculty and students. News outlets reported different sites intentionally for the gym's location. Plans were to be started at once and then sent to Bynum for approval before construction could begin quickly. It was hoped that the construction would be completed by September 1904. At the time it was the second largest gift ever to the university, after a $38,000 donation by Mary Ann Smith. Venable commented that: \\"The University is getting along finely in every way and we are greatly cheered by Judge Bynum's gift.\\" A sketch of the proposed Bynum Gymnasium from a 1904 edition of alt=A building. Architect Frank P. Milburn created plans for the building. In February 1904, President Venable announced that the building's plans had been approved by Bynum and the trustees and work will begin \\"at once,\\" weather permitting. It was to be , with three stories and an above ground basement. The building itself was created with a Greek influence and was to feature a Powhatan grey mottled brick and terra cotta trimmings. The roof was to be slate and the front would feature a central portico. There were to be arched openings and pilasters on the sides of the venue for the gymnasium. It was designed symmetrically and has quoins at each corner. The building included a main gymnasium floor and equipment, a swimming pool, locker rooms with eleven showers, a running track gallery that was above the floor, a room for \\"Swedish movements,\\" and rooms for fencing and boxing, among other amenities. In addition, there were lounges for the students and office spaces for faculty. The building was expected to be heated by a hot water system, along with electrical work for lighting. The prospect of building the new gym caused some relief with regards to Memorial Hall, which had been hosting physical activities and suffered many broken windows. The Morning Post reported on May 10, 1904, that material for the gymnasium had arrived to campus and work was expected to be starting that week. At this point the location of the building was more defined as to be between Smith library and the Carr Building. Mr. Waring of Columbia, South Carolina was announced to be the contractor responsible for building the structure, along with building the Campus Y building concurrently. The construction was revealed to be delayed because the company supplying the bricks did not have their plant properly set up initially. The construction was expected to be uninterrupted during the 1904 summer. By mid-July, it was thought that the construction of the gym would be completed in the fall. An update in November on construction was published by The Evening Tribune, where it stated that the building was coming along rapidly, but the new target finish date was in February 1905. Student newspaper The Tar Heel wrote a column in early February 1905, where it commented on the beauty of the building and pleaded to the student body to keep it in good condition. On February 20, it was announced that the gym had been completed. The building was regarded as one of the most completely equipped gyms in the south, as well as being a \\"handsome\\" and \\"modern\\" structure. alt=A newly finished building. History Following the gym's opening, the swimming pool was filled in early April. It was reported that the first few days students used the pool, the water was freezing cold. It was announced that the building would be formally presented at the spring 1905 commencement on May 30 at noon. Bynum was unable to attend the event in part due to his age at the time. Instead, Venable read two letters from Bynum aloud to the crowd, one where he expressed desire to sponsor the gymnasium and a formal letter presenting the gymnasium to the university. In addition, he explained his reasoning for choosing the University of North Carolina because \\"[the school] has accomplished and is accomplishing so much for the educational growth and prosperity of the state.\\" Dr. Richard H. Lewis officially accepted the building for the university and commented: \\"Nothing appeals more to lusty youth than athletics in all its forms.\\" He also hoped that the Athletic Association of the university would stand \\"to the athletic world.\\" The gym was placed under control of a faculty member that was a trained physician and an assistant. Dr. Robert Lawson (who had coached the baseball team) was revealed later to be the first faculty in charge and his assistant was K. L. Wardlaw. In addition, Lawson was found to be a skilled gymnast and a favorite of the students. One of the main reasons why the Tar Heels did not have a program until 1910 was due to difficulty of finding a place that had a comfortable temperature to play in. Bynum Gymnasium had been used for student's gymnastics beforehand and in ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Tar Heel‚Äô‚Äô, the author wrote that Bynum could be used as the spot for the basketball team to practice because the building wasn‚Äôt used at night. Bynum was known to have many issues including: the floors being slick, the backboard's were \\"a good deal liver\\" than most, and lighting was poor. The Tar Heels stopped playing in Bynum in 1924, and moved into the Tin Can. It replaced Bynum Gymnasium, a venue known for its unusual running track suspended above the court. The gymnasium housed a swimming pool and a suspended indoor track. There was a parallel exercises ladder, which often had the best view of the games. During one game in Bynum, the ladder gave way due to their weight and students were injured. While playing in Bynum Gymnasium, the Tar Heels joined the Southern Conference prior to the 1921‚Äì22 season. The team won the regular season championship in 1923 and 1924, while winning their post‚Äìseason conference tournament in 1922 and 1924. The Tar Heels played thirteen seasons in Bynum and ended with a record of 61‚Äì15 (.803) in 76 total games. After the Tar Heels' departure On January 15, 1924, it was announced that the remodeling of Bynum Gymnasium was completed and it was reopened to students. The renovation was performed by Atwood and Nash. The modifications included reinforcing of the gallery and roof. The Tar Heel wrote that with the men's basketball team's relocation to the Tin Can, that it would not be as highly trafficked, thus allowing for more physical education courses. In October 1938, it was announced that $25,000 had been granted towards the gym again. Upon completion of the renovation, the facility would host the University press that had been using the basement floor. In addition, a third floor will be added to house the journalism department and news bureau. It was thought that the new location for the would greatly relieve the press' previous crowded conditions. Atwood and Weeks announced that the construction would start in December 1938. The building now maintains an administrative purpose including containing the cashier's office and contains offices for the Dean of Graduate Studies and the University counsel.

Originally the center of a small Mexican and Indian 18th Century agricultural community. Built between 1772 and 1816 replacing an earlier church in that location. New Mexico was then part of the Vice-Royalty of New Spain. It is a fine example of a New Mexico Spanish Colonial Church, and is a popular subject for artists. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970. Description San Francisco de As√≠s is located about south of Taos, New Mexico, at the center of the main plaza in the unincorporated community of Ranchos de Taos on the south side of New Mexico State Road 68. It is a large adobe structure, about in length, with a cruciform plan. An adobe wall extends from the back of the church and one of the transepts to form an enclosed rectangular area on the building's south side. Adobe buttresses project from several portions of the main walls, including architecturally distinctive beehive-curved buttresses at the ends of the transepts. The roof is formed out of adobe laid on planking supported by timber vigas, set in distinctive doubly corbelled mounts. The vigas are also more closely spaced than is typically found in other examples of Spanish colonial architecture. The entrance is flanked by a pair of bell towers.

The company was founded in Lahaina, Hawaii in 1980. As of 2015, the company was the third- largest producer of sunglasses in the world. History The company's roots began in 1980 when a fisherman named Jim Richards began selling sunglasses on the beaches of Maui, Hawaii. He was known as the original \\"Maui Jim\\". Several years later, the company developed polarized sunglasses to protect eyes from glare and ultraviolet rays. In 1991, Walter Hester, a boat captain turned oilman, purchased the company after trying the sunglasses. He named the company Hester Enterprises, Inc. In 1994, Illinois-based RLI Vision became the mainland distributor for the company, then called Maui Jim Sunglasses. In 1996, the company bought RLI Vision from its parent company, Peoria, Illinois- based RLI Corp., and named the new combined entity Maui Jim Inc. The transaction was structured such that RLI Corp became a major shareholder in Maui Jim, and the company moved its headquarters to Peoria. The company kept an office in Maui. In 2004, the company opened a distribution center in Braunschweig, Germany, a location that eventually became its European headquarters. In June 2006, the company opened its first prescription lab in Peoria, IL. In 2011, the company bought Zeal Optics, a Boulder, Colorado-based designer and manufacturer of action-sport polarized goggles and sunglasses. By 2015, the company had approximately 500 employees. Also in 2015, the company became the title sponsor of college basketball's Maui Invitational Tournament. In March 2018, the company started selling optical eyeglasses. In July, the company opened its first prescription lab outside of Peoria, located at its European headquarters in Braunschweig. Products As of 2016, the company sold 125 different styles of polarized sunglasses in over 100 countries. In addition to their non-prescription sports and fashion sunglasses, Maui Jim also produces prescription lenses for their designs including progressive lenses. The company's glasses incorporate a patented polarization technology called PolarizedPlus2.

The forest is named after the ancient region of Hyrcania. Since 5 July 2019, the Hyrcanian Forests have been a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Setting Concentrated in Iran, this ecoregion comprises a long strip. This is the coast along the Caspian Sea and the northern slopes of the Alborz Mountains. It covers parts of five provinces, from east to west: North Khorasan, Golestan ( being its south and southwest plus eastern regions of the Gorgan plain), Mazandaran, Gilan and Ardabil. The total wood production from these forests is estimated at . The Golestan National Park and Shastkolateh forest watershed are in Golestan, Mazandaran (where the Hyrcanian forest is estimated at .

The commercial utilization is and the non-commercial utilization is . The Masooleh, Ghaleh Roodkhan and Astara forest watersheds are in Gilan province) and Ardabil Province. At higher elevations to the south, the ecoregion grades into the Elburz Range forest steppe. Its rest is in southeast Azerbaijan. There the ecoregion equates to the Lankaran Lowland and the Talysh Mountains. The ecoregion‚Äôs climate is, where lower, humid subtropical, at mid- altitude, oceanic, and in the mountains, humid continental. Summer is a humid but dry season. The Alborz mountain range is the highest mountain range in the Middle East which captures, by relief precipitation and dew point mists much of the evaporation of the southern Caspian Sea. Annual rainfall ranges from in the east to in the west, making the forests much lusher than the desert, semi- desert, and steppe ecoregions (land) which it borders. Flora thumb200pxMap of biotopes of Iran Broadleaf deciduous forest in Gƒ´lƒÅn Province, Iran The natural forest vegetation is temperate deciduous broadleaved forest. 32.7 percent of volume of Hyrcanian forest is of Oriental Beech (Fagus orientalis). A main feature of the region is the lack of conifers; only relics of coniferous species are present, which include European yew (Taxus baccata), Junipers (Juniperus spp.), Mediterranean Cypress (Cupressus sempervirens var. horzontalis) and Chinese Arborvitae (Platycladus orientalis). The Caspian Sea coastal plains were once covered by Chestnut- leaved Oak (Quercus castaneifolia), European Box (Buxus sempervirens), Black Alder (Alnus glutinosa subsp. barbata), Caucasian Alder (Alnus subcordata), Caspian Poplar (Populus caspica) and Caucasian Wingnut (Pterocarya fraxinifolia), but these forests have been almost entirely converted to urban and agricultural land. (Mosadegh, 2000; Marvie Mohadjer, 2007) The lower slopes of Talysh and Alborz Mountains below harbor diverse humid forests containing Chestnut-leaved Oak, European Hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), Persian Ironwood (Parrotia persica), Caucasian Zelkova (Zelkova carpinifolia), Persian Silk Tree (Albizia julibrissin), and Date-plum (Diospyros lotus) along with shrubs holly (Ilex hyrcana), Ruscus hyrcanus, Dana√´ racemosa and Atropa pallidiflora,Rechinger, Karl Heinz and Sch√∂nbeck-Temesy, Eva 1972.

Persian Ironwood is endemic to the Talysh Mountains and northern Iran and nearly pure stands of the tree can be particularly dramatic, with lichen- covered branches twisting together and only dead leaves in the deep shade of the forest floor. In addition, the ironwood's yellow leaves turn a faint lilac in the fall. At middle elevations between , Oriental Beech is the dominant tree species in this cloudy zone in pure and mixed stands with other noble hardwoods such as Chestnut-leaved Oak, Caucasian Oak (Quercus macranthera), European Hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), Oriental Hornbeam (C. orientalis) and Sweet Chestnut (Castanea sativa). From its floristic composition, these beech forests are linked with European forests and with affinities to the beech forests of the Balkans. However, local conditions of aspect and edaphic factors, such as soil moisture and depth, are all of importance in determining the composition of the vegetation, which leads to the establishment of different beech subcommunities. (Mosadegh, 2000; Marvie Mohadjer, 2007) Upper mountain and subalpine zones are characterized by Caucasian Oak, Oriental Hornbeam, shrublands and steppes. Alpine tundra and meadows occur at the highest elevations. Other native tree species include Caspian Locust (Gleditsia caspica), Velvet Maple (Acer velutinum), Cappadocian Maple (Acer cappadocicum), European Ash (Fraxinus excelsior), Wych Elm (Ulmus glabra), Wild Cherry (Prunus avium), Wild Service Tree (Sorbus torminalis) and lime tree (Tilia platyphyllos). Fauna The Caspian tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) until a time between the 1970s and its 2003 extinction roamed these mountains. Remaining large mammals here are the Caucasus leopard (Panthera pardus ciscaucasica), lynx (Lynx lynx), brown bear (Ursus arctos), wild boar (Sus scrofa), wolf (Canis lupus), golden jackal (Canis aureus), jungle cat (Felis chaus), badger (Meles meles), and otter (Lutra lutra). This ecoregion is the main green resting area for birds migrating between central-northern Russia and Africa so a key habitat for many bird species. Notable birds seen here are the greylag goose (Anser anser), white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons), Little bustard (Tetrax tetrax), glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus), Eurasian spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia), night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), red-breasted goose (Branta ruficollis), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus), Western cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), squacco heron (Ardeola ralloides), greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus), white-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala), and Caspian snowcock (Tetraogallus caspius). Protected areas The diversity and endemism of the species make the Caspian Hyrcanian forests a priority and unique feature for species conservation. Habitats are threatened by conversion into tea, vegetable, fruit, and vine plantations, unsustainable forestry and poaching.

In 1978 the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1991 the bridge was burned down by an arsonist who was trying to fraudulently collect insurance money. The bridge took three years and $300,000 to rebuild and was rebuilt to match the bridge as it was in 1930 after having been reinforced. Most of the cost of reconstructing the bridge was covered by insurance. On 4 July 1994 the bridge officially reopened for the public. In October 2013 the bridge was damaged twice by vehicles, but quickly repaired both times. As photographed by Carol M.

When associated with anemia, it is known as microcytic anemia.  Causes  Microcytic anemia is not caused by reduced DNA synthesis. Thalassemia can cause microcytosis. Depending upon how the terms are being defined, thalassemia can be considered a cause of microcytic anemia, or it can be considered a cause of microcytosis but not a cause of microcytic anemia. There are many causes of microcytosis, which is essentially only a descriptor. Cells can be small because of mutations in the formation of blood cells (hereditary microcytosis) or because they are not filled with enough hemoglobin, as in iron-deficiency-associated microcytosis. Red blood cells can be characterised by their haemoglobin content as well as by their size. The haemoglobin content is referred to as the cell's colour. Therefore, there are both \\"normochromic microcytotic red cells\\" and \\"hypochromic, microcytotic red cells\\". The normochromic cells have a normal concentration of haemoglobin, and are therefore 'red enough' while the hypochromic cells do not; thus the value of the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. The most common cause of microcytosis is iron deficiency anemia. Every time Hb synthesis being impaired in bone marrow microcytosis can occurs such as iron deficiency and Hb pathy may occur in fact when Hb production was impaired: size of each RBCs is decrease in early stage to save mean corpuscular Hb concentration : ie MCHC: so MCV is decreased as compensating mechanism TreatmentSee also * Macrocytosis References External links  Category:Red blood cell disorders Category:Clinical pathology Category:Abnormal clinical and laboratory findings for RBCs de:Mikrozytose ","title":"Microcytosis"},{"id":"18066931","text":"Coirpre Luachra mac Cuirc (flourished mid 5th century) was the ancestor of the E√≥ganacht Locha L√©in branch of the Eoganachta, the ruling dynasty of Munster.

Overview Before Spanish colonialists settled in the Taos area in 1716, the area was home to Taos Native Americans who ranched and farmed in the area. There was a Spanish settlement in the Ranchos de Taos area by 1742 and there may have been residents of the Taos Pueblo who had farmed in the fertile area before that, in which case they sought the shelter of the Taos Pueblo during attacks by Comanche tribes. The plaza is the original location of the village of Ranchos de Taos, built in the late 1770s. In 1776, Francisco Atanasio Dom√≠nguez wrote that \\"the settlement consists of scattered ranchos, and their owners are the citizens who live in the pueblo.\\" At that time, Ranchos de Taos was the largest Spanish settlement in the Taos Valley. It is believed the fortified plaza was built by 1780 when Juan Agustin de Morfi wrote that \\"the settlement forms a square plaza, very capricious. Its houses were almost finished in 1779 with towers at proportionate distances for their defense.\\" The plaza included an observation platforms in round towers and torreones for defense. Fray Jose Benito Pereyro, priest of the Taos Pueblo, agreed to serve the settlers of the village. Around 1815, the San Francisco de Asis Mission Church was built under his direction. In 1840 Matt Field wrote during his travels through New Mexico of Ranchos de Taos: \\"This town called the ranch lies at the base of a gigantic mountain and is watered by a swift stream that rushes from the ravine... It contains about 300 houses, and those are built completely together, forming a wall, enclosing a large square, in the center of which stands a church.\\" A video of the art and history of the mission church may be viewed at the parish office and gift shop, where santos and retablos made by local artists are sold. Along the plaza are adobe buildings that are now retail stores, galleries, and restaurants, one of which was a historic trading post, now Trading Post Cafe.Jeanie Puleston Fleming. \\"The Powerful Simplicity of Ranchos de Taos.\\" Sunset.

Biography The Night escorted by the geniuses of Love and Study, 1886 He moved to Rio de Janeiro in 1854, where he was granted a scholarship to study in the Academia Imperial de Belas Artes (Imperial Academy of Fine Arts). Later he furthered his studies in Europe, at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, being a pupil of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Hippolyte Flandrin and Carle-Horace Vernet, winning much praise for his paintings, and achieving the Doctorate in Sciences at the University of Brussels, in 1868. Returning to Brazil, he produced one of the most well known works of art in Brazil: Independence or Death!, depicting the moment when Prince Peter declared the country independent from Portugal, a work that has illustrated History books for elementary schools in Brazil for decades.

Massimo Filippo Antongiulio Maria Freccia (19 September 1906 ‚Äì 16 November 2004) was an Italian American conductor. He had an international reputation but never held a post as music director of a major orchestra or opera house. Unusually for an Italian, he built his career around symphonic music rather than opera. For several years he was an assistant to Arturo Toscanini, whom he venerated, and he was regularly invited by Toscanini to conduct the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Massimo Freccia came from a wealthy background and counted royalty and aristocrats among his friends. He was born on 19 September 1906 in the Tuscan village of Valdibure, near Pistoia, not far from Florence. His father was a solicitor and landowner, his mother from an aristocratic Pistoian family. She was a good amateur pianist, and encouraged Massimo's growing interest in music, engaging a violin teacher for him when he was six. He had no formal school education. When World War I broke out, his Russian great-aunt came to live with them. Brought up by his mother on Vivaldi and Corelli, he was introduced to Tchaikovsky, Schumann and Wagner which his great-aunt played for hours on the piano. She recounted tales of her youth in Saint Petersburg when she met Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov. In 1923, when he was 17, Freccia went to the Florence Conservatory of Music, where he became friends with the composer Luigi Dallapiccola, who introduced him to the music of the contemporary school of Italian non-operatic composers such as Gian Francesco Malipiero, Giorgio Federico Ghedini, Goffredo Petrassi and Alfredo Casella. Freccia began to conduct in a garage adjoining the family's villa in Florence, which he converted into a studio where he and his fellow-students played through works for small orchestra. He was entirely self-taught as a conductor, learning mainly by watching others. He obtained a job as apprentice at the opera in Florence, playing the celesta in the pit and then rushing backstage to play the harmonium so that the prima donna could stay on pitch. From Florence he went to Vienna, where he heard Richard Strauss conduct his operas, Mozart masses in the churches, and Bruckner and Mahler symphonies in the concert-halls. At an Italian Embassy party he met Franz Schalk, then music director of the State Opera. When Freccia expressed his admiration for the young Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler's concerts, Schalk turned frosty and described Furtw√§ngler as a \\"talented amateur\\". But he gave Freccia a pass to attend rehearsals at the Opera, where he heard singers such as Elisabeth Schumann, Lotte Lehmann, Leo Slezak and Alfred Piccaver. He also heard Schalk conduct the Vienna premiere of Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex. Freccia then moved for two years to Paris, where he met Jean Cocteau, Stravinsky and Picasso. He also met the pianist Arthur Rubinstein and the composer Maurice Ravel, to whom he showed a tone-poem which he had composed in Vienna. Ravel played some of it, studied the score, complimented Freccia on his technique and orchestration and ended by saying: \\"But my dear young man, all that is very good, but it's all Ravel!\\" His friendship with the composer Joaqu√≠n Nin led to his first engagement in 1929. When a ballet company was formed in Paris around the dancer Antonia Merc√© y Luque (known as La Argentina), Freccia was appointed assistant conductor. This led to a post as conductor of a group specialising in contemporary Italian music. After a spell with them, he returned to Vienna to conduct the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, where he was noticed by a Hungarian who had just founded the Budapest Symphony Orchestra. Freccia was appointed conductor and met Zolt√°n Kod√°ly and B√©la Bart√≥k. He conducted the first performance of the orchestral version of the latter's Transylvanian Dances. In 1934 Freccia took the orchestra on an Italian tour. Benito Mussolini attended the concert, in Rome, and summoned Freccia to meet him next day in the Palazzo Venezia to discuss his views on the string section. While on a visit to New York in 1937, Freccia was invited - on Toscanini's recommendation - to return the following year to conduct the New York Philharmonic in a series of summer concerts at the Lewissohn Stadium. Sensing that war in Europe was inevitable, he sought a residence visa for the United States. Through Arthur Judson, the NYPO manager, he accepted an engagement with the Havana Philharmonic Orchestra, thereby being able to return from Cuba on a permanent Italian visa. He found the orchestra a poor ensemble, but trained it skillfully and was appointed its music director 1939-43. Soloists of the quality of Arthur Rubinstein and Jascha Heifetz played with it. It was in Cuba that he forged a friendship with George Gershwin and met his future wife Maria Luisa (Nena) Azpiazu. After four years Freccia returned to New York on a special visa. He was rejected for the U.S. Army, and in 1944 became conductor of the New Orleans Symphony Orchestra, where he remained for eight years. He returned to Cuba in 1945 to marry Nena. In 1952 he left New Orleans for the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Freccia made his London debut in October 1954 with the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO) in the Royal Festival Hall, conducting the British premiere of Samuel Barber's oratorio Prayers of Kierkegaard. This had not been a success at its American premiere, but Freccia had liked it and persuaded Barber to revise and cut it. The composer told him: \\"It's practically your work.\\" Freccia returned to London for several years as guest conductor of the LPO, the Philharmonia, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) and the BBC Symphony Orchestra. In 1959 Freccia returned to Italy for six years as conductor of the RAI Orchestra. During that time he twice conducted concerts for Pope John XXIII. Freccia made some international tours, conducting in Japan in 1967 and then in Australia. In later years he conducted frequently in Monte Carlo. For four years he conducted concerts with the Juilliard Orchestra in New York. He returned to Vienna in 1981 to conduct the Radio Orchestra and conducted the RPO in London in 1983 and 1986 in concerts for the RAF Benevolent Fund. His last London appearance was on 15 June 1987, when he conducted Verdi's Requiem at the Festival Hall in the presence of Diana, Princess of Wales in commemoration of the 30th anniversary of Toscanini's death. Freccia lived in London for many years. His last concert was in 1998 when, at the age of 92, he conducted Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in the square at Montepulciano. He made fine recordings of Berlioz‚Äôs Symphonie fantastique with the RPO, and Shostakovich‚Äôs Fifth Symphony with the LPO, as well as several discs of the Russian and Italian repertoire. He accompanied soloists such as Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli and Earl Wild in the piano concerto repertoire. Massimo Freccia published an autobiography, The Sounds of Memory, in 1990 when he was 84, in which he expressed candid views on other conductors. Most of them, he wrote, were too conceited, mistrustful and even occasionally vicious. Sir Thomas Beecham, for instance, \\"emphasised his pomposity\\" by his poses and pretensions. \\"Not once have I been touched by his performances. I always found his artistry superficial.\\" Herbert von Karajan was \\"not a nice man\\". Leopold Stokowski produced a lush sound, yet \\"one had the feeling that underneath there was something false. His speech was particularly affected... He gave the impression of a glittering, multi- coloured painted shell; when one looked inside one found an infinite emptiness.\\" Only Toscanini escaped savage censure, although Freccia conceded that his reputation for strict observance of the score was a myth. He died on 16 November 2004, aged 98, survived by his wife. They had no children, although she had a daughter from her first marriage.

When Bertie gets involved with a chorus girl, Alice O'Neil (Carole Lombard), and Marion falls in love with Henry Morgan (Charles Starrett), an auto mechanic, the family tries to intervene to prevent their children from marrying beneath themselves.TCM Full synopsis Cast * Miriam Hopkins as Marion Lenox * Carole Lombard as Alice O'Neil * Frank Morgan as Bronson Lenox * Charles Starrett as Henry Morgan * Henry Wadsworth as Bertie Lenox * Winifred Harris as Carrie Lenox * Herbert Yost as George Grafton * David Hutcheson as Lord Rockingham * Ilka Chase as Millie Montgomery * Herschel Mayall as Judge Summers Cast notes: A typographical error in the title cards for this film turned starlet \\"Carol Lombard\\" into \\"Carole Lombard\\", a name she kept for the remainder of her career.Erickson, Hal Plot synopsis (Allmovie) Production David Gray and Avery Hopwood's play, The Best People, opened on Broadway on 19 August 1924 and ran for 142 performances. (It was later revived in 1933 when it ran for a more modest 67 performances.) Hopwood was a prolific and successful playwright, many of whose plays were adapted into films - his 1919 play The Gold Diggers provided the template for the Warner Bros. series of movie musicals. The Best People was made into a silent film in 1925, The Best People, before Paramount had it refashioned into a vehicle for Miriam Hopkins, an established Broadway star who had just signed with the studio after making the short subject The Home Girl for them in 1928. Fast and Loose was her second film appearance. Fast and Loose was also Preston Sturges' second Hollywood assignment, after The Big Pond (and its French-language version La grande mare). Carole Lombard, on the other hand, had appeared in over 40 films by the time Fast and Loose was released, all as \\"Carol Lombard.\\" ReferencesExternal links  * * lobby poster Category:1930 films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:American films based on plays Category:Films directed by Fred C.

Built in Japan and going by the alternative name \\"Pro-8\\" in some markets, this was one of the last synthesizers produced by the company and was assigned model number 608. It was released in 1985 at a list price of $1,199 (or $1,195; this number varied between advertisements). This and some other Sequential Circuits synthesizers (the Six-Trak, Multi-Trak and MAX) were built around the Curtis Electronics CEM 3394 \\"synth-on-a-chip\\" integrated circuit, and used a Z80 as their central microprocessor. Features and Cabinet Brief Summary of Features= This electronic keyboard is an 8-voice polyphonic, bi-timbral analogue synthesizer with the ability to split or layer two sounds (\\"double\\" mode). It has 64 memory locations for sounds (\\"patches\\"). Patches may be \\"linked\\" in memory so that calling up one automatically calls up the second for a split or layer. A monophonic mode, with all eight oscillators producing the same sound at once, is also possible. Polyphonic portamento is also available. The instrument features MIDI, including the capability to save and restore patches with system-exclusive data (see MIDI for more detail about this process). =Front Panel= 300px The front panel has two volume knobs (one for each available sound), a master tuning knob, a data entry knob for programming patches, modulation and pitch wheels, various buttons for mode (layer, or \\"double\\", split) and program selection, and a four by eight grid for programming (with all parameters labelled on the grid; see Figure 1). Some other functions are also listed on the panel as a reminder of which buttons to press. The case is metal with light blue graphics and lettering, red LED indicators, and black painted wooden end pieces. =Back Panel= The back panel has quarter-inch jacks for recording data to cassette tape (one also doubling as a footswitch input), MIDI in and out DIN connectors, separate quarter-inch audio outputs for each of the two sounds and a mix audio out (both sounds combined), a power switch, and a fuse socket. =Keyboard= The keyboard is five octaves (61 notes, C to C) and is unweighted. It has no velocity or aftertouch sensitivity. Voice Architecture and Sound Programming Voice Architecture= 300px The synthesizer voices are based on the Curtis Electronics CEM 3394 chip. This allows for one voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) per voice, with on/off toggles for any combination of sawtooth, triangle and variable pulse waveforms. There are coarse (up to 4 octaves) and fine (to just under a semitone) tuning parameters. A \\"poly mod\\" parameter allows the audio output of one voice to feed another's voltage-controlled filter (VCF) when they are layered in \\"double\\" mode. This results in a sound with 4-voice polyphony with no audio from the second voice's oscillators, processed through two filters in series. The single low-frequency oscillator (LFO) is free-running (i.e. doesn't restart when a key is depressed), with programmable rate (0.25 to 20 Hz according to the manual), and has programmable depth and waveform (triangle or square). This can modulate any combination of filter cutoff frequency, pitch, or oscillator pulse-width. There is a chorus with fixed rate and frequency. Filter cutoff frequency, resonance (to self-oscillation), keyboard tracking (off, half or full) and envelope amount can be programmed, but the envelope cannot be inverted. The two ADSR envelopes modulate the VCA and the 24 dB/octave VCF. The rate for the polyphonic portamento is programmable. \\"Unison\\" (monophonic mode) can be programmed for each patch. In this mode, the envelopes are re-triggered only after all keys are released (\\"legato\\", with low-note priority), and a delay of four oscillators relative to the other four can be programmed (fixed at 20, 40 or 80 milliseconds). A program can be \\"linked\\" to another so that both are called up and assigned correctly in a split or layer. There is also a programmable output level for each patch to help balance loud and soft sounds. =Performance Controls= There are separate volume knobs for channels A and B (i.e. the two patches in a split or layer). The footswitch can be programmed to momentarily change patches, or change one of several patch parameters: filter cutoff frequency, ADSR envelope amount or attack; VCA decay or release; voice volume (the momentary value of any of the preceding being user-defined); chorus on/off, or portamento on/off. The parameter value knob can be used to alter one parameter in real-time, although the value will \\"jump\\" to the knob's current setting as soon as it is moved and some parameters stairstep badly when treated this way. The pitch- bend wheel is not spring-loaded and is centre-detented. Oscillator tuning can be initiated from the front panel, with this process taking about twenty seconds. During tuning, the instrument is silenced. =MIDI Implementation= The Split-8 has quite advanced MIDI implementation for an instrument of this vintage. OMNI mode, wheel controller reception/transmission and program change can be toggled on or off. All MIDI operation (in and out) can be disabled, and there is the capability for saving and loading patches. The MIDI receive channel (1-16) can be set for each patch. Four voices can be assigned to one patch that is controlled only via MIDI, with the other four playing a patch controlled only from the keyboard. In this case, wheel effects can be disabled for the MIDI-controlled patch. The Split-8 also recognizes incoming pitch-bend and modulation wheel data as well as note number, note on and off, program change, and tuning request. Some MIDI functions are accessed through a special \\"MIDI Expand\\" mode. This is entered by holding down the RECORD button and pressing PROGRAM SELECT 5. All of the LEDs for the PROGRAM SELECT buttons blink, and pressing one of these PROGRAM SELECT buttons now performs one of the following: # Selects MIDI mode 1 (OMNI on/poly). If the instrument is in SPLIT mode, data from the MIDI in port will be passed to both programs (as though the synth were in DOUBLE mode). This is the reverse of using button 3, below. # Initiates a 2,240 byte system exclusive dump consisting of patch data. The LED for PROGRAM SELECT 2 remains lit during the few seconds that this takes. # Selects MIDI mode 3 (OMNI off/poly). This is the reverse of using button 1, above. # Not used. # Toggles between enable and disable of program changes. Transmission and reception of program changes via MIDI is disabled by default when the synthesizer is switched on. # Toggles between enable and disable of both the pitch-bend and modulation wheels. On power-up, MIDI transmission and reception for both is disabled by default. When sending MIDI program (system-exclusive) information to the Split-8, the 64 patches are sent as a string of single-patch packets, so loading single patches at a time is possible. When sending all 64, the synthesizer will sporadically \\"lose\\" some patches, presumably because it cannot handle MIDI data transmitted at the speed that modern computers can send it. Most music software allows the user to insert a short delay between packets of sysex information, circumventing this problem. A 50 millisecond delay is adequate. According to the manual, it is possible to have the Split-8 respond to a system-exclusive dump-request, but the manual does not indicate what the request bytes are, nor is there a byte-map of the sysex data. The Split-8 does not respond to the MIDI \\"all notes off\\" message, and pitch-bend depth is fixed at +/- a major third. Other information Use in Recorded Music= An audio sampling CD entitled ‚ÄúAstral Ambience‚Äù, produced by Martin Newcomb of the Museum of Synthesizer Technology, features a large list of vintage synthesizers, including the Split-8. The CD was very favourably reviewed in the June 1996 issue of Keyboard magazine, although no explicit mention is made of the Split-8 sounds.Keyboard Magazine, June 1996, pp. 77-80. =Spare Parts and Manuals= A source of spare parts and manuals for the Split-8 is Wine Country Productions. They also have Split-8 owner‚Äôs manuals and cassette tapes of the original preset sounds (data that can be uploaded into the instrument). =Literature= Advertisements of about a third of a page in size can be found in contemporary issues of Keyboard Magazine.Keyboard Magazine, July 1985, p. 60; Sept 1985, p. 62. The owner's manual and service schematics are available from Wine Country Productions.

It opened in 1958 and hosts the NHRA's Mopar Mile-High Nationals. The facility has a seating capacity of 23,500 spectators. History In 1958, John Bandimere Sr. purchased a parcel of land on the west side of Denver nestled up against the Hogback leading up to the Rocky Mountains. He and his family began the process of constructing a small but efficient drag strip that was to be used to augment their auto parts business. It also was the fulfillment of a dream of John Sr.'s to provide a safe environment for young people to learn about cars and race them off the streets. In 1988 the Bandimere family made the decision to undergo a much-needed $4 million improvement project, which included a year sabbatical on the national event circuit. The many facility improvements allowed for diversity of events, more spectator seating, better pit areas for race vehicles, improved spectator parking and access to all areas of the facility, and an unsurpassed venue for sponsor involvement with improved sign visibility. The ability to host larger spectator events added a tremendous amount of exposure opportunities for the facility and its sponsors. Seating capacity of the grandstands was increased from approximately 8,000 to over 23,500. Now, nearly 50 years later, the only thing at Bandimere Speedway that has not changed is the facility's location. Nearly every original building has been replaced including the original spark plug-replica timing tower and the event schedule has grown nearly 10 times its original size to host a variety of specialty events, including the NHRA Mello Yello Mopar Mile- High Nationals. \\"This speedway was the fulfillment of a life-long dream of dad and mom's,\\" relates John Bandimere, Jr., track president. \\"It gives me great joy to know that through the efforts and support of many dedicated people over the years, we are enjoying over 45 years as a successful full-time racing facility and look forward to many more years in the business.\\" The track has several quirks that make it unique within the NHRA's schedule of events. First, and foremost, is the altitude. At over 5,000 feet above sea-level, the air is much thinner than any of its sea-level counterparts, which translates out to less air being pushed over the rear wings, and a loss of downforce, the thinner air also slows the cars down dramatically, a 330 mph run on any other track would barely top 320 at Bandimere, while a sub-4 second run would be over the 4 second mark. The NHRA also adjusts the indices in their bracket categories, typically by six tenths. Super Comp runs to 9.50, Super Gas to 10.50, and Super Street is run to 11.50 seconds. All bracket racing-based classes are also reindexed because of altitude. The track is also the only NHRA sanctioned track with a downhill staging area, and uphill shut down strip. The latter being a substantial safety measure.

It features a quarter-mile dragstrip, a road course, an off-road course, and motorboat racing lake. History The facility opened as Firebird International Raceway in 1983 and hosts the NHRA's Arizona Nationals. It held one IMSA GT race, in 1987. Due to its warm climate, it is a popular winter testing spot for NHRA and IndyCar teams. In December 1992, Three-time Formula One World Driving Champion Ayrton Senna famously tested an IndyCar at this facility (then still called Firebird International Raceway) with Team Penske. Senna was intrigued, but eventually decided to stay in Formula One. The venue currently hosts an array of auto enthusiast events, such as the NHRA Nationals, Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series, Lucas Oil Regional Off-Road Racing Series, Red Bull Global Rally Cross, Bug-o-Rama, Formula Drift, Friday Night Drags, Drift & Drag Nights. The 600 acre multi-use facility is currently used by dragsters, monster trucks, off-road races, and drag boats. Some of the biggest brands in motorsports, including Lucas Oil, Coca-Cola, CARQUEST and Ford have sponsored the circuit. The park includes four race tracks: a 1/4 mile NHRA sanctioned drag strip; 1.6 mile road course; a 10-turn 1.25 mile road course; and a 1.1 mile road course, incorporating 11 tight turns and a 3/8 mile straight-away. It also features a 2.4 mile IHBA- and APBA-sanctioned oval lake. On February 24, 1985, in one of the most chilling accidents ever seen at the lake, Drag Boat Racer Sunny Moon was nearly killed after jumping out of his drag boat when he jammed his throttle going around 160 MPH, which launched into the air after hitting the shore and exploded into flames after slamming into a row of high tension power lines. Moon was knocked unconscious after hitting the water at 160 MPH, but amazingly, he suffered only minor injuries in the accident. The accident was filmed by cameraman Terry Fox.

Matthew V. Scannapieco, he was charged with illegally accepting cash payments to influence planning processes and tax evasion. Legal problems Scannapieco pleaded guilty to accepting $245,000 in bribes from several land developers. On June 20, 2008, Matthew Scannapieco was sentenced to serve nearly two years in prison. The sentence was reduced from 15 years as the ex-mayor helped authorities in their probe of corruption in the Monmouth County township, specifically, the prosecution of three major developers including Anthony Spalliero. The former mayor also pleaded guilty to tax evasion, specifically for failing to pay federal taxes on the money he accepted from several land developers involved with W.B. Associates.http://newark.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel10/nk012910.htm =Specific payments= Scannapieco admitted receiving the following corrupt payments in exchange for his official action: *$25,000 in 1997, in exchange for supporting the developer's project on Texas Road; *$60,000 in 1997 and 1998, in exchange for supporting the rezoning of property south of Woodcliff Boulevard. *$25,000 in 1999, for working to settle a dispute between the developer and Marlboro Township regarding the developer's rights on Dutch Lane, Vanderburg Road, and Pleasant Valley Road. *$100,000 in 2001 and 2002, for supporting rezoning property located on and around the former Marlboro Airport site. *$10,000 in 2001 or 2002, for persuading an elected state official to assist the developer in procuring an easement across a railroad line near Dutch Lane and Buckley Road. *$25,000 in 2002 and 2003, for supporting approvals to construct a large retail store on Routes 9 and 520. In pleading guilty to tax evasion, Scannapieco admitted that he did not report to the IRS any of the bribe payments he received from the developer. A certified public accountant and certified financial auditor, Scannapieco also admitted that he regularly purchased cashier's checks and postal money orders - in structured amounts and with cash to avoid federal cash-transaction reports - and used the cashier's checks and money orders for personal expenses. Scannapieco admitted that between tax years 1998 and 2002, he failed to pay more than $80,000 in additional taxes. Rape In August 2015, he pleaded guilty to child sexual abuse. His victim, a relative, was six years old at the start of the abuse, which lasted two years. Scannapieco sexually abused the girl over a three-year period while awaiting sentencing in federal court after pleading guilty to the tax and bribery charges in 2005.

Although considered less than completely successful, it saw extensive service.Page of Navweapons 267 guns were built.  Design  QF 5.25-inch Mark I turret on Unlike its French and Italian contemporaries of similar size the QF 5.25 was designed as dual- purpose gun capable of engaging both aircraft and surface targets. Combining the secondary and heavy anti-aircraft armament allowed a significant weight savings for the s, which were designed to meet the Washington Naval Treaty limit of 35,000 tons. The gun fired an shell, which was considered the largest that a gun crew could easily handle while still having the rate of fire needed for anti-aircraft use. In 1944, VT-fuzed shells became available, making the gun significantly more effective against aircraft. The 5.25 was carried in Mk I twin mountings by the King George V class and in Mk II twin mountings on 9 of the first 11 anti-aircraft cruisers, the exceptions being and , which mounted QF 4.5-inch Mk III guns due to shortages of the 5.25-inch gun. The last five of the Dido class also known as the Bellona-class anti-aircraft cruisers mounted the 5.25-inch in the Remote Power Control RP10 Mk II mountings, which offered much-improved training and elevating speeds. The number of turrets on the Bellona class were reduced from five to four, and the number of light AA guns were increased. The RP10 Mk II mountings were also later used to replace the Mk I mountings on . The last of the Royal Navy's battleships which was commissioned after the war, , featured MK I turrets with enlarged gun houses compared to those fitted to the King George V and Dido- class ships, although the width between the guns remained the same.Campbell, p.46 A slightly more powerful Mk II variant was also deployed by the British Army as an anti-aircraft and coast-defence gun.

The ballistic performance of the QF 5.25 was very good, with a maximum range of 24,070 yd (22,010 m) at 45 degrees with an 80 lb (36.3 kg) HE shell.Navweapons site, QF Mark I In comparison, the French Mle 1934 guns as used on the s had a maximum range of 21,872 yards (20,000 m) at 30 degrees with an 88 lb (39.9 kg) SAP shell.Navweapons site, Model 1934 and Model 1934 R1938 The Italian 135/45 mm gun as used on the s had a maximum range of 21,435 yards (19,600 m) at 45 degrees with a 72.1 lb (32.7 kg) AP shell.Navweapons site, Models 1937 and 1938 The QF 5.25 guns performed well on during Operation Halberd, escorting a convoy to Malta under, but later Prince of Wales was overwhelmed and sunk while operating as part of along with Repulse when Force Z was attacked by Japanese aircraft, due to factors unrelated to the guns performance.Battleship, Middlebrook No Dido-class cruisers were lost to air attack, although four were sunk by submarine or surface-launched torpedoes.Raven, Dido Class Cruisers However , a Bellona-class cruiser (Improved Dido), was sunk at anchor in 1944 by a Luftwaffe guided missile. According to postwar publications the gunhouses were cramped, and the heavy projectile and cartridge cases resulted in a reduced sustained rate of fire to seven or eight rounds per minute rather than the designed twelve rounds per minute.Garzke&Dullin;, 1980. pp. 228‚Äì229 However, these factors do not appear to have reduced HMS Euryaluss rate of fire, over a one-minute period, which was typical for a World War II AA engagement.Hodges, Tribal Class Destroyers, p 32: Diagram of High Level Bomber Attack: A 240 mph target, at 12 thousand feet altitude could expect to be under for fire about 75 seconds, from the time it enters the effective range of the HACS until it flies to within the minimum range of a 5.25 gun elevated to 70 degrees. A Tribal-class destroyer would be able to engage the same target for about 37 seconds. The dual-mount turrets 10 deg/s traversal speed was considered too slow to engage higher- speed aircraft at close range.A 270-knot (500 km/h) target crossing the line of sight at right angles, at 2000 yards (1829 m) range, will move across the line of sight at 4.5 degrees per second. This simple fact of geometry appears to contradict the assertion that a 10-degree-per-second traverse rate was too slow to track a high-speed aircraft. Nevertheless, these elevation and traverse rates were still higher than some contemporary weapons, such as the 10.5 cm SK C/33 twin mounts carried on the German battleships and .Navweaps 10.5 cm/65 (4.1\\") SK C/33 Inside a 5.25-inch gun turret on HMS King George V in 1943.

None was forthcoming. However, later that year Anti-Aircraft Command in UK acquired three twin-gun turrets from the Admiralty, which were installed around London in permanent positions. Trials and use led the army to design a single gun mounting in two marks, both with an underground engine room to provide electrical and hydraulic power for traverse, elevation, fuze setting, ramming and other tasks. Fitted with the standard army Machine Fuze Setter No 10, these guns had a rate of fire of 10 rds/min and a maximum height of 50,000 ft, with an effective height of 36,000 ft.Routledge 1994, page 87, 78. \\"Effective height\\" was the greatest at which a 400 mph target could be engaged for 30 seconds using Predictor No. 10 (the all-electric US Bell AAA Computer) : hence with a realistic prospect of damaging the target. The shell could travel up to 50,000 ft but with little tracking capability, hence little effectiveness. Mark 1A was a mild steel turret for anti-aircraft use only, Mk 1B was an armoured turret for anti aircraft and coast defence use. The gun was designated Mk 2. By the end of 1943 only 16 of the new guns had been installed, far below projections. By the end of the war 164 guns had been produced.Routledge 1994, page 92 The high-explosive shells were fuzed with the standard army No 208 mechanical time fuze, used with 3.7 and 4.5-inch anti- aircraft guns. The guns remained in service after World War II, and in 1953 11 guns were installed in Gibraltar.Hogg pg. 105-106Routledge pg 77, 92,204, 207, 432 Late in World War II, seven guns were mounted in Australia and three in New Guinea, in enclosed single-gun anti-aircraft/coast defence turrets.DW Spethman, \\"The garrison guns of Australia 1788-1962\\", pages 145-6.

It was a member of the Thor family of rockets, and was derived from the Thor-Able. The Ablestar second stage was an enlarged version of the Able, which gave the Thor-Ablestar a greater payload capacity compared to the Thor-Able. It also incorporated restart capabilities, allowing a multiple-burn trajectory to be flown, further increasing payload, or allowing the rocket to reach different orbits. It was the first rocket to be developed with such a capability and development of the stage took a mere eight months. Nineteen Thor-Ablestar were launched between 1960‚Äì1965, of which four failed, and a fifth resulted in a partial failure, as only one of two payloads separated from the upper stage. The first failure was the launch of Courier 1A, an experimental communications satellite, on 19 August 1960 when the first stage shut down 30 seconds earlier than planned and was destroyed by the Range Safety officer. On 30 November, another launch involving a Transit satellite failed in practically identical fashion. This episode nearly created an international incident as parts of the Thor landed in Cuba. Cuban leader Fidel Castro subsequently sold off the Thor's engine to the Soviets and the Chinese received its thrust vectors, which ended up proving valuable to the latter's development of a ballistic missile capability. To prevent this from happening again, future Thor Ablestar launches had their flight paths modified to avoid passing over Cuba. The launch of a Transit satellite on 22 February 1961 was successful, but its companion Lofti satellite failed to separate from the second stage. On 29 June 1961, a Thor-Ablestar successfully inserted a Transit-4A into orbit, but two hours later the Ablestar exploded for unknown reasons into hundreds of pieces, which remained in orbit. The third launch failure occurred on 24 January 1962 when the second stage produced insufficient thrust to achieve orbital velocity for several piggybacked satellites. The fourth and final failure was the launch of an Anna geodetic satellite on 10 May 1962 when the second stage completely failed to ignite. Two versions were built; the Thor-Ablestar 1, with a DM-21 Thor, and an AJ-10-104 second stage engine, and the Thor-Ablestar 2, which had a DSV-2A Thor first stage, and an uprated AJ-10-104D engine on the second stage. Thor- Ablestar 1 launches occurred from LC-17 at Cape Canaveral, and Thor-Ablestar 2 rockets were launched from LC-75-1 at Point Arguello, which has since become part of Vandenberg Air Force Base and is now designated SLC-2.
