Biography He was the only son of John Danby Palmer, by Anne, daughter of Charles Beart, of Gorleston, Suffolk, and was born at Yarmouth on 1 January 1805. He was educated at a private school run by Mr. Bowles in Queen Street, Great Yarmouth, and in 1822 was articled to Robert Cory, F.S.A., an attorney, under whom he had previously served for two years, in order to qualify himself to become a notary public. He was admitted an attorney in June 1827, and practised at Yarmouth until his retirement. For many years he resided at No. 4 South Quay, in an Elizabethan house which his father had purchased in 1809. He became an alderman of the old corporation, and in August 1835 was elected mayor; but the passing of the Municipal Corporations Act prevented his taking the oath in the following September, and the new corporation elected Barth as chief magistrate. Palmer occupied a seat in the reformed corporation as a representative of the south ward. In 1854 he was elected mayor, and was re-elected in the following year. He also served as deputy-lieutenant for the county of Suffolk. He was the chief promoter of the Victoria Building Company; and as a result of his attention, the Priory Hall was restored and converted to a \\"National\\" school, and the whole of the seafront was developed as a seaside resort, with the new Marine Parade and the erection of a series of buildings, notably the Britannia Terrace, the Carlton Hotel (as it became), the Assembly Rooms (Masonic Lodge), and the Wellington Pier. In 1830 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He died at his residence, Villa Graham, Great Yarmouth, on 24 September 1882. He married Amelia Graham, daughter of John Mortlock Lacon, but they had no children.

Retrieved on April 30, 2009 was a made man and a caporegime who ran major loansharking and illegal gambling operations for the Chicago Outfit. He is best known as a central figure in Operation Family Secrets and the subsequent Federal trial. Calabrese, who was battling myriad ailments, died on Christmas Day 2012 at the Federal Medical Center, Butner, in North Carolina.  Early life  Frank Calabrese Sr. was born in Chicago, Illinois on March 17, 1937 to James and Sophie Calabrese.Calabrese, Frank Jr. (2011) Operation Family Secrets: How a Mobster's Son and the FBI Brought Down Chicago's Murderous Crime Family. New York: Broadway Books. pg. 6. Calabrese grew up on the West Side of Chicago, dropped out of school in the fourth grade and sold newspapers on Grand Avenue, he told jurors during a trial in 2007. He also told jurors that his family was so poor that they would eat oatmeal for dinner. Calabrese enlisted in the U.S. Army, however he went AWOL 5 days after boot camp.  Career in the mob  Calabrese's arrest record dates from 1954, when he served two years in prison for a violation of the Dyer Act (auto theft).UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v. JOSEPH FRANK LaMANTIA: 1993 pg 15. Retrieved on April 30, 2009 He was The Outfit's Chinatown, or 26th Street, crew boss who provided loans to hundreds of customers at exorbitant interest rates that varied from one percent to 10 percent per week. The federal government estimates that Calabrese's crew grossed more than $2,600,000. Calabrese instructed his crew members to, \\"do anything you have to do\\", to collect the loans. If a debtor did not have the money, the Calabrese crew would seize the debtor's car, home and business. Calabrese reported to Angelo J. LaPietra \\"The Hook\\", who was the ultimate boss of the 26th Street Crew and founder of the Italian American Club from where operations were handled. At one point, Calabrese gained control of an auto repair shop in River Grove, Illinois, when the owner, Matthew Russo, fell behind on a loan. In 1990, Calabrese entered an agreement with a car dealership in Elmhurst, Illinois, to direct car repair work to this mob- controlled repair shop in exchange for kickbacks. However, Russo had become an undercover government informant and recorded the mobsters at one meeting at the dealership. Calabrese and eight of his crew members‚Äîsons Frank Calabrese Jr., and Kurt Calabrese, brother Nick Calabrese, Louis Bombacino, Philip Tolomeo, Kevin Kudulis, Terry Scalise and Philip Fiore‚Äî were eventually arrested.  1995 arrest and subsequent conviction  On July 28, 1995, Calabrese, his brother, Nick, and two sons, Frank and Kurt, were all indicted by federal authorities and charged with using threats, violence and intimidation to enforce their loansharking racket from 1978 until 1992. On March 21, 1997, Calabrese and his sons pleaded guilty to the charges, just weeks before they were set to go to trial. \\"I'm very sad that this brings my kids into something that should never have happened\\", Calabrese told U.S. district judge James F. Holderman. On October 15, 1997, Calabrese was sentenced by Holderman to 118 months in federal prison. He apologized to the court and his family for, \\"all the trouble I have caused.\\"  Operation Family Secrets trial  The investigation which led to the Family Secrets trial began when Calabrese's imprisoned son, Frank Jr., wrote to the FBI and volunteered to wear a wire on his father and uncle. He did not ask for sentence reduction or financial gain in exchange for doing it. Viewing this as a great opportunity, the FBI agreed to Frank Jr.'s proposal. During their imprisonment, Frank Jr. recorded his father admitting to multiple murders. Faced with the evidence gathered by his nephew, Frank Sr.'s brother Nicholas Calabrese also agreed to testify against the Chicago Outfit. On April 25, 2005, Frank Calabrese Sr. and a large number of high-profile Chicago Outfit gangsters were charged with murder, racketeering, extortion, and running an illegal gambling business as part of the federal-government initiated \\"Operation Family Secrets\\" investigation. The Family Secrets trial began on June 19, 2007. Among the prosecution witnesses were Calabrese's brother, Nick Calabrese, and Frank Calabrese Sr's. son, Frank Calabrese Jr. An unusual aspect of the Family Secrets trial was that several members of the Chicago Outfit took the stand in their own defense. Calabrese testified on August 16, 2007 that he was not a \\"made\\" member of the Chicago Outfit, but he acknowledged that he put out street loans and that he paid a mob boss some of the proceeds. On September 10, 2007, Calabrese and other Outfit defendants were convicted of a racketeering conspiracy that included murder, extortion, and loansharking. On September 11, 2007, during a court hearing to determine whether Calabrese and other defendants were also guilty of various murders related to the case, Calabrese exclaimed, \\"Them are lies!\\" in response to a prosecutor's statement that Calabrese had left \\"a trail of bodies, literally.\\" On September 27, 2007, jurors found that Calabrese had committed seven of the 18 murders in the indictment (of the 18 murders, Calabrese had been accused of taking part in 13 of them). After the verdict, news came out that a juror had alleged that on August 27, 2007, Calabrese had said or mouthed, \\"You are a fucking dead man\\", to Prosecutor T. Markus Funk. On April 10, 2008, Judge James Zagel denied a request to order a new trial in the case, saying that he did not believe that the threat had tainted jurors. However, the threat resulted in Calabrese being placed in highly restrictive lockdown during his stay in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago while awaiting sentencing. On January 28, 2009, Judge Zagel sentenced Calabrese, then 71, to life in prison for his crimes and called the acts he had committed, \\"unspeakable\\". On finding prosecutors had proven the murder allegations, the judge sentenced Calabrese for all 13 slayings.  Later criminal accusations  On June 8, 2011, Calabrese was indicted on charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States and attempting to prevent seizure of Calabrese's property. The charges were announced the next morning by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago. Calabrese was accused of plotting with a former prison chaplain to recover a violin hidden in a Wisconsin house.  Personal life and death  Calabrese and his first wife, Dolores, divorced in 1984. He has four children: Frank Jr., Kurt, Nick and Emmilio by a long time Cuban mistress from New York by the name of Flor Sosa. During an interview, Kurt stated that the youngest Calabrese son, Nick, did not get involved with their father's criminal enterprise, presumably due to the age difference between Nick and his two elder brothers. Calabrese resided in Oak Brook, Illinois, until his imprisonment in the mid-1990s. Calabrese died at the age of 75, on December 25, 2012, at the Federal Medical Center, Butner, North Carolina.

The chain consists of seventeen restaurants. The restaurant has its origins in Dallas with the original owner, Dick Chase's opening of a \\"fine-dining\\" establishment in 1985. The establishment was a complete failure, which resulted in bankruptcy. Rather than continue with the upscale restaurant motif, Dick retooled his efforts and decided to \\"go sloppy.\\" Dick's likeness is still featured on their t-shirts and promotional materials. The end result was a success, leading to the creation of more locations. In 1995, the company attempted to expand to Europe and opened a restaurant in London, but the effort was abandoned and the restaurant was sold in early 1996. The company is now owned by Deja Vu, a large entertainment and restaurant conglomerate, and the concept has expanded to dozens of states. Atmosphere Dick's Last Resort teaches its servers to be obnoxious. In addition to the staff, the decor is considered to be \\"wacky.\\" The restaurant uses picnic-style tables and paper tablecloths. Patrons of Dick's are expected to be insulted, or placed in uncomfortable situations. Adult bibs and large, hand-made, paper hats are given to diners to wear during their stay. There are no napkins on the tables; they are generally thrown at the customers by the serving staff. Menu Dick's menu is influenced by Southern cuisine, consisting of hamburgers, barbecue, and seafood items. In addition to food and drink, Dick's offers souvenirs such as \\"Real Women Love Dick's\\" T-shirts and \\"I Love Dick's\\" bumper stickers.

Bulletin des Sciences, par la Societe Philomatique 1816: 198 in French They are native to the southeastern United States from Louisiana to Virginia. Plants of this genus are known commonly as chaffheads.Carpephorus. Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS). Description These are perennial plants that grow from a caudex and fibrous root system. The stems are erect and unbranched, usually reaching 20 to 60 centimeters (8-24 inches) in height, and taller at times. The leaves are alternately arranged and point upward, sometimes pressed against the stem. The blades vary in shape and are hairy to hairless and generally glandular. The flower heads are borne in open inflorescences. Each head contains up to about 35 disc florets, usually lavender to dark magenta or pinkish purple, sometimes blue. The fruit is a ribbed, rough-textured cypsela with a pappus of bristles.  Classification  Some authors separate certain species into separate genera, Trilisa and Litrisa, on the basis of certain floral characters. The species are similar enough in other aspects that other authors maintain them in Carphephorus. Molecular data may support the separation of at least some of the taxa. Carphephorus is in the tribe Eupatorieae of the aster family. Like other members of this tribe, the flower heads have disc florets and no ray florets. It is also in the subtribe Liatrinae along with, for example, Liatris and Garberia. ;Species and varietiesFlann, C (ed) 2009+ Global Compositae Checklist Biota of North America Program 2013 county distribution maps *Carphephorus bellidifolius - sandywoods chaffhead - Georgia South Carolina North Carolina Virginia *Carphephorus carnosus (syn.

Prior to joining Williams, he was the race engineer for Felipe Massa at Ferrari. After eight years, both moved to Williams; Smedley as Head of Vehicle Performance, and Massa as driver. Smedley's radio transmissions to Massa have even achieved cult status, with many Ferrari fans putting his messages on their mobile phones as ringtones. Biography and career Smedley attended St Peter's School in South Bank before going to St Mary's Sixth Form College. He lived in Normanby until he was 18, before going to Loughborough University and beginning his rise through the ranks in motorsport. He initially studied a degree in mathematics and mechanical engineering, before going on to complete a master's degree. With his main field of activity in chassis engineering, after leaving university, Smedley began working with Pilbeam Racing Designs on the MP80 Peugeot in 1997 where he worked as a suspension design engineer for the touring car team. He then went on to work in Formula 3000 and the Williams touring car team before making his first foray into Formula One with the Jordan Grand Prix team. Initially at Jordan, Smedley worked as a data acquisition engineer, overviewing all of the telemetric data that was used by the team's race engineer to support the racing driver. During 2002 and 2003 he went on to be a track engineer for Jordan, before moving to the Ferrari test team at the end of the 2003 season. Smedley initially chose to work on the Ferrari test team because of the possibility to make more technical input, something which is more limited in the race team. In the middle of the 2006 season, he replaced Gabriele Delli Colli as Felipe Massa's race engineer. Almost immediately Massa's form improved; his previously common errors became less frequent, and in August 2006, Massa took his first Formula One pole position and victory at the Turkish Grand Prix. Smedley is noted for his very frank and occasionally humorous radio transmissions to Massa. This includes at the 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix when he was heard clearly saying \\"Felipe baby, stay cool\\" after Massa was complaining about not having a clear visor for the wet race which was being restarted. Following Massa's injury at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, Smedley carried on with the role of race engineer for stand-in drivers Luca Badoer and Giancarlo Fisichella as they took over Massa's seat for the remainder of the 2009 season. Smedley had previously worked with Fisichella at Jordan. On 31 January 2014 it was announced by Ted Kravitz (Sky Sports F1) on the last day of testing at Jerez, that Smedley would once again resume his professional relationship with Massa by joining Williams for the 2014 season. In November 2018, Smedley announced he would leave Williams at the end of the 2018 season. Smedley was awarded an honorary degree (\\"Doctor of Professional Studies\\") from Teesside University in 2009. In July 2015 he was also awarded an honorary Doctor of Technology from Loughborough University in recognition of his outstanding contribution to Formula 1 and race engineering. 2010 German Grand Prix At Hockenheim Smedley delivered a very terse radio instruction, \\"OK, so, Fernando is faster than you. Can you confirm you understood that message?\\", towards the end of the race when Massa was in the lead. Massa then allowed Alonso to overtake him and win the race. Following the pass on lap 49 Smedley added 'OK mate good lad, stick with him now, sorry.' After the race Ferrari were fined $100,000 for breaching race regulations concerning team orders but the result was allowed to stand.

Zero-byte files cannot be loaded or used by most applications. Even a file describing an empty word processor document, an image file with zero-by-zero dimensions, or an audio file of length zero seconds usually still contains metadata identifying the file format and describing some basic attributes of the file; it results in the file with some positive size. Some very simple formats do not use metadata, such as ASCII text files; these may validly be zero bytes (a common convention terminates text files with a one- or two-byte newline, however). Conversely, zero-byte files must use some disk space to be indexed by a filesystem (though none for content, in most cases). In some cases, zero-byte files may be used to convey information like file metadata (for example, its filename may contain an instruction to a user viewing a directory listing such as , etc.); or to put in a directory to ensure that it is nonempty, since some tools such as backup and revision control software may ignore the empty directories. There are many ways that could manually create a zero-byte file, for example, saving empty content in a text editor, using utilities provided by operating systems, or programming to create it. On Unix-like systems, the shell command \`$ touch filename\` results in a zero-byte file . Zero-byte files may arise in cases where a program creates a file but aborts or is interrupted prematurely while writing to it. Because writes are cached in memory and only flushed to disk at a later time (page cache), a program that does not flush its writes to disk or terminate normally may result in a zero-byte file. When the zero-byte file is made, file system does not record the file's content on storage, but only updates its index table.

Alongside rheumatic heart disease, Kawasaki disease is considered to be the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children worldwide. Early life and education Tomisaku Kawasaki was born on 1 February 1925 in the Asakusa district of Tokyo, as the youngest of seven children. He was \\"very interested in plants and fruit, and surprised to learn how the 20th-century pear had suddenly appeared\\", but eventually abandoned plans to study botany because his mother favored him to be a physician. He studied medicine at Chiba University, graduating in 1948. Career Kawasaki conducted his medical internship year in Chiba and decided to specialize in pediatrics, because of his fondness of children. Medical residency in post-war Japan was unpaid and as his family suffered financial problems, his advisor recommended him take up a paid position at the Japan Red Cross Medical Center in Hiroo, Tokyo. He would later practice as a pediatrician there for over 40 years. After 10 years of researching milk allergy and unusual host-parasite cases, he saw a 4 year old boy presenting with a myriad of clinical signs he later termed \\"acute febrile mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome\\" (MCLS) in 1961.Clinicians' Battles, Doctors whose names are found in the disease, (2000), edit. Itakura E. Medical Sense, Tokyo, in Japanese, quoteIt was in January 1961 that I encountered a child patient, aged 4 years and 3 months, who was to become the first known case of Kawasaki disease. Fifty years have elapsed since then. At the time, I had no choice but to discharge the patient as ‚Äùdiagnosis unknown.‚Äù Fortunately, the child suffered no sequelae, and is currently enjoying a full and active life as an adult. Since then the incidence of Kawasaki disease has continued to grow. Why? Why can‚Äôt we stop this disease? The reason, unfortunately, is that its cause is not known. At the time I first described the disease, I felt that we were on the threshold of discovering its cause, since its symptoms were extremely clear-cut. Despite the efforts of numerous researchers, however, we are still searching. It is my strong hope that young researchers will be able to identify the root cause of this disease.\\" In 1962, he saw a second patient with the same constellation of symptoms. After he had collected a series of seven cases, he presented them at a meeting of the Japanese Pediatric Association. Reviewers rejected his submission for publication because they did not believe it was a new disease entity. Opposition from several academics over the alleged discovery of the new disease lasted several years. Only after he had collected a total of 50 cases, his 44-page paper was published in the Japanese Journal of Allergy in 1967. The paper included comprehensive hand-drawn diagrams of each patient's rashes and has been described as \\"one of the most beautiful examples of descriptive clinical writing\\". Other colleagues across the country soon reported similar cases. It was not until 1970, that the Ministry of Health and Welfare eventually established a research committee on MCLS headed by Dr. Fumio Kosaki. This committee conducted a nationwide study on the disease, confirming it was a new disease which specifically targeted arteries across the body. In 1973, a pathologist discovered the connection to cardiac disease when he found a child with Kawasaki disease had coronary artery thrombosis at an autopsy. Kawasaki headed the Kawasaki Disease Research Committee which published its findings in the journal, Pediatrics finally in 1974; He has been called \\"part Sherlock Holmes and part Charles Dickens for his sense of mystery and his vivid descriptions\\". It was the first time MCLS was published in English and brought international attention to the disease. Kawasaki retired in 1990, and established the Japan Kawasaki Disease Research Center, which he led as director until 2019 and honorary chairman until 2020. Only in 1992, Kawasaki disease was officially added to Nelson's Textbook of Pediatrics, a leading textbook in the specialty, cementing international recognition of the disease. In 2007, Kawasaki estimated over 200,000 cases of Kawasaki disease had been diagnosed in Japan since the research committee's findings in 1970. Kawasaki himself never referred to the disease by its eponymous name but conceded that the original name was too long. Personal life and death Kawasaki was married to fellow pediatrician Reiko Kawasaki who died in 2019. He died on 5 June 2020 of natural causes at the age of 95 years old. He was survived by his two daughters and a son. Obituaries paying tribute to Kawasaki were published in medical journals worldwide in the aftermath of his death.

The park attracts 400,000 visitors per year. The park first opened in 1989 and is generally open year-round, but is closed for a few days of the week during term time. History In 1999 Mo Chaudry's family trust bought Water World from Rank Leisure for ¬£1.5m, at the time the park was operating at a loss. Early in the 21st century WaterWorld began turning profits. In summer 2019, four new rides came to Waterworld as part of their 30th anniversary, and Stormchaser and Hurricane opened on 21 August, while the other two, Thunderbolt and Cyclone, opened a few days later on 24 August. The tallest rides in Tornado Valley overtake the Twister and become the tallest rides in the park. WaterWorld hosted events run by British Naturism for 20 years but these were suspended in September 2020 following abuse of WaterWorld staff by anti-naturism protestors. Rides The park's rides and attractions include: Black Hole, The Nucleus, Space Bowl, Super Flume, Twister, Python, Rapids, Medium Sized Flumes, Toddler Slides, Bubble Pools, Outdoor Pool (seasonal), Interactive Jungle House, The Lily pads, Racing Slides, Wave Pool, Toddler Slide and the Assault Course. =The Nucleus= The Nucleus is an indoor water rollercoaster which transports the ride participant through 375 feet of ups and downs in a rubber ring. You must be 1.1 metres to ride the Nucleus. You climb the stairs after you've queued to collect your rubber ring and the lifeguard will then push you off and down you go. a blaster boosts you and you enter a tunnel before a drop into a second blaster which sends you up and over, through a tunnel and down to the final drop where a water blaster slows you down and if there's a queue, you hand your ring to another person. =Space Bowl= The space bowl is themed inside the water park acting as a UFO. The ride takes you to the UFO that is a spiral leading to a drop into a 2-meter tub of water. It is said to be only for strong swimmers. It depends on how you'll drop out of the UFO, sometimes you might drop out head first and most of the time you fall out of the UFO on your side. However, some people come out feet first but it's quite rare. =Rapids= The rapids make you feel like you're in a current. It's formed in a shape like a circle and has a pirate theme. It's also only for strong swimmers aged over 8. You can try to escape the strong current by holding onto bars but sometimes the rapids will overpower you. =Twister= The Twister was the tallest flume at Waterworld until 2019 when four new rides (Stormchaser, Hurricane, Cyclone and Thunderbolt) were built for Waterworld's 30th anniversary. You climb a ladder to a platform where the entrance to the Twister is. Goggles are not permitted to be worn on the Twister and you slide down a tube at a fast speed twisting around the corners where a mini water effect might catch you by surprise. you end off creating a tidal wave of water that falls into a pool beneath the exit to the Twister. At the end there's a sign that says run because sometimes they might want to speed up the operating faster. It used to have a skull for the entrance to the Twister but that was removed in 2017. =The Three Flumes= The Three Flumes are the Super Flume, Python and Black Hole and they are slides that are next-door to each other and they end up in the same pool. Tornado Alley Tornado Alley opened in 2019 and consisted of four new rides. Stormchaser, Hurricane, Cyclone and Thunderbolt.

The place of \\"Mississippi Rag\\" in the genre Since being rediscovered during the first ragtime revival during the 1950s, \\"Mississippi Rag\\" has traditionally been regarded as the first ragtime instrumental published. Some musicians, for example Bill Edwardshttp://www.perfessorbill.com/pbmidi5.shtml prefer to classify the piece as a cakewalk, that is of a slightly earlier precursor style from which ragtime developed. To support this, Edwards points to the paucity of true syncopation in the written score. On the other hand,like many cakewalk pieces, \\"Mississippi Rag\\" readily lends itself to syncopated embellishment by the performer, as Edwards' own rendition of the piece demonstrates.http://www.perfessorbill.com/midi/mississi.mid References *Blesh, Rudi, and Harriet Janis.

It was documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1934. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 13, 1972, and its boundary was increased on March 9, 1983.  History  The Cashier's House was designed by Philadelphia-architect William Kelly and was built as part of a three- structure complex, in 1839. The Coach House and Old Custom House were also part of the complex. It was built primarily as the residence for the chief executive officer of the next door Erie Branch of the Bank of the United States. The bank closed in 1841, but the cashier of the bank continued to live in the house until his death in 1843. In 1850, the house was sold for $4,000 ($ in present-day terms) at half of its original cost. The Cashier's House was bought by Samuel Woodruff in 1872. The Woodruffs occupied the Cashier's House until 1913, leading the house to sometimes be referred to as the \\"Woodruff Residence\\" or \\"Woodruff House.\\" HABS photo of Cashier's House, next to the Old Custom House, in 1934 The state of Pennsylvania bought the Cashier's House on July 17, 1963 for $30,800 ($ today).

On March 9, 1983, the boundary of the site‚Äîas defined by the National Register‚Äîwas increased to include the Coach House. On March 12, 2013, ownership of the Cashier's House and the adjacent Old Custom House, was transferred by the Pennsylvania Historical & Museum Commission to the Erie Art Museum, which has occupied the Custom House since October 1983. = Coach House = The Coach House, located on East 4th Street, was built at the same time of the Old Custom House and the Cashier's House. The house was sold to a marble dealer in 1882 and was sold, again, in 1904 to a blacksmith. The depth of the house was expanded to nearly triple the original size by the blacksmith to house heavy machinery.  Design  The Cashier's House is wide and deep.

Recall that an idempotent morphism p is an endomorphism of an object with the property that p\\\\circ p = p. Elementary considerations show that every idempotent then has a cokernel.Lars Br√ºnjes, Forms of Fermat equations and their zeta functions, Appendix A The pseudo-abelian condition is stronger than preadditivity, but it is weaker than the requirement that every morphism have a kernel and cokernel, as is true for abelian categories. Synonyms in the literature for pseudo-abelian include pseudoabelian and Karoubian.  Examples  Any abelian category, in particular the category Ab of abelian groups, is pseudo-abelian. Indeed, in an abelian category, every morphism has a kernel. The category of associative rngs (not rings!) together with multiplicative morphisms is pseudo-abelian. A more complicated example is the category of Chow motives. The construction of Chow motives uses the pseudo-abelian completion described below.  Pseudo-abelian completion  The Karoubi envelope construction associates to an arbitrary category C a category kar(C) together with a functor :s:C\\\\rightarrow kar(C) such that the image s(p) of every idempotent p in C splits in kar(C). When applied to a preadditive category C, the Karoubi envelope construction yields a pseudo-abelian category kar(C) called the pseudo-abelian completion of C. Moreover, the functor :C\\\\rightarrow kar(C) is in fact an additive morphism. To be precise, given a preadditive category C we construct a pseudo-abelian category kar(C) in the following way. The objects of kar(C) are pairs (X,p) where X is an object of C and p is an idempotent of X. The morphisms :f:(X,p)\\\\rightarrow (Y,q) in kar(C) are those morphisms :f:X\\\\rightarrow Y such that f=q\\\\circ f = f \\\\circ p in C. The functor :C\\\\rightarrow kar(C) is given by taking X to (X,id_X).

The Commonwealth War Cemetery is located north of the commercial center of the neighborhood.Jacobs, 1998, p.455. History Shuja'iyya dates from the Ayyubid period in Gaza, and is named after Shuja' al-Din Uthman al-Kurdi, an Ayyubid emir (\\"commander\\") who died fighting against the Crusaders in 1239.Haldimann and Humbert, 2007, p. 195According to Al-Maqrizi, cited in Cohen and Lewis, 1978, p. 119 The district is the first extension of Gaza beyond its Old City, and was a mixed quarter, as opposed to other quarters of Gaza.Meyer, 1907, p. 108 It was generally a commercial district, but also partially residential. During the Middle Ages, the neighborhood's houses were poorly built and its roads were narrow and unpaved. However, it also boasted many extravagant mosques and Muslim sanctuaries.Sharon, 2009, pp. 30 -31 The 14th-century Ibn Uthman Mosque and al-Zufurdimri Mosque are located in Shuja'iyya, The 15th-century Mahkamah Mosque is also located there. Being built outside the city's wall, Shuja'iyya had more potential to grow than the al-Daraj, Zaytoun, and al-Tuffah quarters. It eventually grew to become the largest neighborhood in Gaza. It was divided into separate northern and southern parts along ethnic lines. The southern part of the area is called al- Turkuman because of the concentration of Turkoman clans who settled there during the reign of Ayyubid sultan as-Salih Ayyub between 1240-49. The northern part was called al-Judaida or Shuja'iyya al-Akrad. It was populated by Kurds originally from the Mosul area. The Ottoman census of 1525 shows a relatively equal population of Turks and Kurds, with 89 and 90 households, respectively. The Jews were the single largest ethnic group with 95 households, while the Christians had 82. In 1538, however, the Kurdish and Turkoman populations grew dramatically, especially the former. The Kurds had 278 households while the Turks had 181. In 1549, the Kurdish population grew sharply to 406 houses, while the Turkomans maintained a steady growth to 195 houses. The remnants of Mamluk military units resided in their own separate small community in Shuja'iyya. Their population consisted of 44 households in 1557 which dwindled to 66 persons in 1597.Cohen and Lewis, 1978, pp. 120-5; cited in Sharon, 2009, pp. 30 -31 =Modern era= The Shuja'iya Primary School for Girls was founded in the neighborhood in 1967.

The clash resulted in the death of an IDF officer and four Islamic Jihad militants, and the day has been commemorated by the latter as the \\"Battle of Shuja'iyya.\\" On the first anniversary of the operation, in 1988, the Islamic Jihad called for a general strike against Israel.Abu 'Amr, 1994, p. 107 The neighborhood is a long-term stronghold of Hamas.

A new development began initiated by III of Orlando, Florida and guided by Dr. Ferguson. Original plans called for both VM/CMS and new VSE versions. However, part way into development, Westinghouse began to break up the division during the outsourcing thrust of the Reaganomics era. Through badly managed negotiations, Westinghouse ended up with neither developers or outsourcing partners, which spelled the end for one of the industries foremost software groups.  Marketing  North American marketing was conducted by the WEMS marketing group based in Pittsburgh, and included first level tech support. Westinghouse Electric Management Systems, SA (WEMSSA), Paris, London, Geneva, Z√ºrich, Munich, and Amsterdam, was given world marketing rights, initially for Europe, Africa, and the Far East.

The Palacio de la Exposici√≥n is a building on Colon Avenue in downtown Lima, Peru. It was constructed in the 19th century with the Park of the Exposition to house the International Exposition of Lima in 1872. Since 1957, it has been home to the Lima Art Museum.  History  The building was constructed in unison with the Park of the Exposition and was ordered built by president Jose Balta in 1869 for the international exposition that was to take place in Lima in celebration for fifty years of Peruvian independence. The construction of the building took place between 1870 and 1871. The building is of a neo-Renaissance style and was designed by the Italian architect Antonio Leonardi. Its design was considered a pioneer of its time in South America as it was one of the few buildings constructed of steel. In July 1872, both the palace and the park were inaugurated and the exposition took place soon after. After the exposition, the palace was home to the Society of Fine Arts. During the War of the Pacific the building loote. After the looting it was used as a hospital and later a garrison for the Chilean army. In 1889, the Peruvian government ceded the building to the Municipality of Lima. In 1905, the building became home to the National Museum of History and the Ministry of Public Works. Later, throughout different time periods, it was used by the Chamber of Deputies, the Direction of Traffic, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Municipality of Lima. Art Museum of Lima In 1954, the Municipality of Lima ceded the building to the Patrons of the Arts civil association for refactioning and remodeling to convert it into an art museum. The Lima Art Museum () opened in 1957 while its official inauguration took place in 1961.

He later operated a successful clothing and export business that manufactured camouflage clothing to governments in the United States, Israel, and Libya. He was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1988. Youth in Kansas Heydt was born in Wellington, Kansas, and graduated from North High School in Wichita in 1936. In August 1935, Heydt set a new record at the Missouri Valley A.A.U. championship, swimming the 150-yard backstroke in 1:46.6. He enrolled at the University of Iowa in the Fall of 1936. Championship swimmer After swimming for Iowa in his sophomore year, Heydt transferred to the University of Michigan to work with legendary coach Matt Mann of the Michigan Wolverines swimming and diving team. After transferring, Heydt became eligible to compete for Michigan in February 1940, and won the Big Ten championship in the 150-yard backstroke in both 1940 and 1941. At the Big Ten Conference swim meet in early March 1941, Heydt set a new conference record for the 150-yard backstroke with a time of 1:41.6. At the NCAA tournament later that month, Heydt shaved nearly four second off his time, swimming the 150-yard backstroke in a time of 1:37.7, winning the individual championship. Two years later, another Michigan swimmer, Harry Holiday, broke Heydt's record, swimming the 150-yard backstroke with at time of 1:33.5. Heydt also participated in Michigan's NCAA 300-yard medley relay championships in 1940 and 1941. Heydt's performances also helped Michigan win the NCAA team championships in both 1940 and 1941. =Honors= Heydt was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1988. Business career After graduating from Michigan with a business degree, Heydt and his wife opened a clothing store, Lee's Men and Boys Store, in Mission, Kansas. In 1956, Heydt purchased a larger clothing store in Hutchinson, Kansas. He sold the store in 1959 and purchased a clothing factory in Oswego, Kansas, later opening a second factory in Commerce, Oklahoma. Operating as the Francis E. Heydt Company, Heydt later opened additional factories in Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Tennessee. Heydt specialized in manufacturing camouflage clothing, flight suits, and other clothing for the United States and other countries, including Israel and Libya. He also sold airport runway sweepers, dog tag making machines, file cabinets, batteries, pipelines and airplanes. In the 1980s, Heydt's company became involved in a dispute with the government over allegations that the company paid a government official a $10,000 gratuity in exchange for a contract to manufacture 56,800 night camouflage desert trousers. The government sought to disbar the company from conducting business with the government and refused to pay invoices totaling $175,000. In 1991, the company sued Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney in a suit that resulted in a published decision from the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. Francis E. Heydt Co. v. U.S. and Richard Cheney, 948 F.2d 672 (10th Cir. 1991). In 1983, Heydt received further public attention when former CIA agent and explosives smuggler Edwin P. Wilson was charged with smuggling guns and 21 tons of C-4 plastic explosives to Libya. Wilson was also charged with taking out contracts for the murder of two prosecutors and six witnesses. The indictment stated that Heydt was on Wilson's \\"hit list\\" and that Wilson offered $500,000 for Heydt's murder.

Characteristics These regular troops played an important role in the initial conquest of the various colonial possessions of the Kingdom of Italy. They subsequently acted as garrison and internal security forces in the Italian Empire, and finally served in large numbers during the Italian conquest of British Somaliland and the East African campaign of 1940-41 .History of Eritrean Ascari (in Italian) History > Except for the German parachute division in Italy and the Japanese in Burma > no enemy with whom the British and Indian troops were matched put up a finer > fight than those Savoia battalions at Keren (Eritrea).

These troops comprised infantry, cavalry and some light artillery units. They were recruited initially from Eritreans and subsequently from Somalis, with Italian officers and some non-commissioned officers. The Italian Askaris fought in the First Italo‚ÄìEthiopian War, the Italian-Turkish War, the Second Italo-Abyssinian War and World War II (East African Campaign).Ascari: the brave Italian soldiers of color Out of a total of 256,000 Italian troops serving in Italian East Africa in 1940, about 182,000 were recruited from Italian Eritrea, Italian Somalia and the just recently occupied (1935‚Äì36) Ethiopia. In January 1941, British Commonwealth forces invaded Ethiopia and the majority of the newly recruited Ethiopian Ascaris serving with the Italian Army in East Africa deserted. Most of the Eritrean Ascaris however remained loyal until the Italian surrender four months later.Ascari:the lions of Eritrea Development of the Ascari The name \\"ascar\\" is the Arab word for \\"soldier\\". The Eritrean Ascari originated from a mercenary Arab group employed by the Ottoman Empire and called Basci Buzuks. This irregular force was created in Eritrea by the Albanian adventurer Sagiak Hassan, who worked for local Eritrean tribes in the second half of the 19th century. In 1885 the Italian colonel Tancredi Saletta, commanding officer of the Italian troops during the conquest of Eritrea, brought the Basci Buzuks (with their armaments and families) into Italian service as irregular auxiliaries. In 1889 the first four regular battalions of Eritrean soldiers were created in Asmara. Those Eritrean troops were incorporated into the Italian colonial Army with the name Ascari. They were successfully used in battle by the Italians, for the first time, against the Dervisci in Sudan.The Eritrean Ascari against the Dervisci Initially the Eritrean Ascari comprised only infantry battalions, although Eritrean cavalry squadrons (Penne di Falco) and mountain artillery batteries were subsequently raised. By 1922 units of camel cavalry called \\"meharisti\\" had been added. Those Eritrean camel units were also deployed in Libya after 1932. During the 1930s Benito Mussolini added some armored cars units to the Ascari. Prior to World War I service with the Ascari had become the main source of paid employment for the indigenous male population of Eritrea. During the expansion required by the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1936, 40% of eligible Eritreans were enrolled in these colonial troops.Ascari: the brave Italian soldiers of color Uniforms and ranks Eritrean regiments in Italian service wore high red fezzes with coloured tufts and waist sashes that varied according to each unit. As examples, the 17th Eritrean Battalion had black and white tufts and vertically striped sashes; while the 64th Eritrean Battalion wore both of these items in scarlet and purple. The Eritrean Ascari had the following ranks, from simple soldier to senior non commissioned officer: Ascari - Muntaz (corporal) - Bulukbasci (lance-sergeant) - Sciumbasci (sergeant). The Sciumbasci-capos (staff-sergeants) were the senior Eritrean non-commissioned officers and were chosen according to their fighting performance in battle. All of the commissioned officers of the Eritrean Ascari were Italian, who wore similar uniforms and insignia to their counterparts in the regular Italian Army Ascari del tenente Indro (in Italian) Until 1915 Eritrean units wore white uniforms comprising long coats and loosely cut trousers for all occasions. Khaki drill clothing was subsequently adopted for active service and ordinary duties, though the white uniforms were retained for ceremonial duties. Performance in battle Graves of unknown Ascaris killed in 1941 during the Battle of Keren The Eritrean Ascari were considered the best of Italy's colonial soldiers, with a reputation similar to that of the Gurkhas in the British Empire forces. They were accordingly widely employed in other Italian colonial possessions in Africa. Eritrean NCOs were seconded to newly raised Somali and Ethiopian units after 1936. Notable events in the history of Italy's Eritrean Ascaris included: # Battle of Agordat - (Mahdist War) # Battle of Kassala - (Mahdist War) # Battle of Coatit - (First Ethiopian War) # About six thousand Eritrean Ascaris, serving in both infantry and artillery units, were present at the Battle of Adwa where they fought against 120,000 Ethiopians on 1 March 1896. Of these, 2,000 ascari were killed and 800 were captured and mutilated by having their right hands and left feet amputated by the victorious Ethiopians, who considered them as traitors.Raffaele Ruggeri, \\"Le Guerre Coloniali Italiane 1885/1900\\", Milano 1988 # In the Italian conquest of Ethiopia (1935‚Äì1936) the veteran Eritrean Ascaris, with their high morale and aggressive spirit, played a key role, often taking the lead during attacks.David Nicole , \\"The Italian Invasion of Abyssinia 1935-36\\", About 60,000 Eritreans served in both regular ascari units and in irregular bands. Nearly 5,000 Eritrean Ascaris were killed in this war. # During World War II a number of Eritrean Ascari were awarded the Gold Medal for Military Honor at both the Battle of Cheren and at the Amba Alagi. Some of the remaining Ascari fought with lieutenant Amedeo Guillet in his Italian guerrilla against the Allies after the Italian Army surrender in Gondar in November 1941. Amedeo Guillet and his \\"Gruppo Bande Ertirea\\" One of the most famous Italian officers who commanded groups of Eritrean Ascari in Ethiopia and Eritrea was Amedeo Guillet. Amedeo Guillet and his Amhara cavalry At the beginning of World War II the Italian Viceroy Amedeo Duke of Aosta gave lieutenant Guillet command of the 2,500 strong Gruppo Bande Ertirea, an irregular unit made up mainly of recruits from Hamasien. This force was primarily a cavalry one, but also included camel mounted troops and some Yemeni infantry led by Eritrean Ascari NCOs. At the end of 1940 the British Empire forces faced Guillet on the road to Amba Alagi close to Cher√π. He was charged with the task of slowing the allied advance from the North-West. His Eritrean ascaris had some success in doing this but suffered many casualties. Guillet's most important battle happened towards the end of January 1941 at Cher√π when he decided to attack enemy armoured units. At dawn the Gruppo Bande Tigre, armed only with sabres, rifles and hand grenades charged an allied column which included armoured vehicles. They passed unhurt through the British force who were caught unaware. Guillet then turned to charge again. In the meantime however, the British had organised themselves and fired horizontally with their howitzers, inflicting heavy losses on the Italian-led troops and their horses. This was the last cavalry charge the British faced and the last but one in the history of Italian cavalry.British article on Guillet's life and his Gruppo Bande tigray Guillet's Eritrean ascaris suffered losses of about 800 in little more than two years. In March 1941 his forces found themselves stranded outside the Italian lines. Guillet began a private war against the British. Hiding his uniform near an Italian farm, he conducted guerrilla raids with his remaining ascaris against British and Ethiopian forces for almost eight months. He was one of the most famous Italian \\"guerrilla officers\\" in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia during the Italian guerrilla war against the Allies occupation of the Italian East Africa. Eritrean Ascari after World War II Many Eritrean Ascari fought for the independence of Eritrea after WWII. Among these was Hamid Idris Awate, nicknamed the Father of Eritrea because he fired the first shots of the Eritrean War of Independence against the Ethiopians.Photo of Hamid Idris Awate as Eritrean Ascari officer After the official end of the Italian Empire in 1947, the Italian government had created organizations dedicated to the welfare of former Ascaris living in Italy and Eritrea. In 1950 the Italian authorities created a pension fund for nearly 140,000 Eritrean Ascari who had served in the Italian Colonial Army. Even if the amount was minimal (the equivalent of $100 yearly), this was paid through the Italian Embassy in Asmara and was of some value in the underdeveloped economy of Eritrea after World War II. During the 1992-93 UN Intervention in the Somali civil war, an elderly Ascari joined an Italian unit with his original uniform and rifle, stating that he had sworn a lifetime oath to \\"Italy, to the King and to the Duce.\\" By the end of the mission he had been given the rank of marshal.https://italiacoloniale.com/2017/05/01/viva-il-duce-viva-il-re-lonore- di-scire-lascaro-ancora-fedele-allitalia/ In 1993, 1,100 Ascari were still living in Eritrea.

Originally a group of eight segregation academies, the membership grew to 60 by the 1971‚Äì72 school year. In 1990, the group voted to change its name to the Alabama Independent School Association. In 2008, an all-black school, Restoration Academy joined the AISA with no serious incidents. Today, the AISA serves 70 member schools. Most member schools are located in the state of Alabama, but one member school is located in Meridian, MS and one affiliate member is located in Smyrna, TN The association offers its members with the opportunity to participate in numerous academic competitions, professional development programs, athletic programs and legislative tracking services as well. In addition to the opportunities to participate in academic competitions, professional development and athletics, the AISA also maintains an accreditation partnership with AdvancED and offers member schools the opportunity for dual accreditation through AISA & AdvancED. This partnership was formed in 2012 after the long history of accreditation being offered through the AISA. The athletic department of the Alabama Independent School Association sanctions and oversees high school athletics for approximately 50 private schools in the American state of Alabama. Sanctioned varsity and junior varsity sports include the following: football, basketball, baseball, fast-pitch softball, track and field, volleyball, golf, tennis, soccer, and cheerleading. Schools are classified into three classes, according to student enrollment, with championships awarded by class. The AISA also sanctions youth football for second grade through sixth grade. The AISA offices are located on the campus of Huntingdon College in Montgomery, Alabama.

The Buddha rejected this and the opposite concept of ucchedavada (annihilationism) on both logical and epistemic grounds.

Page from 1976 to 1979, and Karl Edward Wagner from 1980 to 1994. The series was discontinued after Wagner's death. It was a companion to DAW‚Äôs The Annual World‚Äôs Best SF and The Year's Best Fantasy Stories, which performed a similar function for the science fiction and fantasy fields. Each annual volume reprinted what in the opinion of the editor was the best horror short fiction appearing in the previous year. The series also aimed to discover and nurture new talent. It featured both occasionally recurring authors and writers new to the horror genre. Veterans among the contributing authors included Brian Lumley, Eddy C. Bertin, Kit Reed, R. Chetwynd-Hayes, Ramsey Campbell, Dennis Etchison, Richard Matheson, Robert Bloch, and Tanith Lee; some of the relative newcomers to the field featured were Stephen King, Al Sarrantonio, Lisa Tuttle, Jessica Amanda Salmonson, David Drake, Juleen Brantingham, and Nina Kiriki Hoffman.

Glendon (c. 1920 - December 25, 2008) was an American attorney who specialized in issues relating to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and represented The Washington Post in the Pentagon Papers case. Early life and education Glendon was born in Medford, Massachusetts and grew up in Stoneham, Massachusetts. He attended College of the Holy Cross and enlisted in the United States Navy in 1941 following graduation. He served on a troop transport ship as a communications officer and earned five battle stars for his participation in the amphibious invasions of North Africa, Italy and the Normandy Landings. He left the Navy with the rank of lieutenant.Grimes, William. \\"William R. Glendon, 89, Dies; Argued for Right to Publish Pentagon Papers\\", The New York Times, January 3, 2009. Accessed January 4, 2009. Career After ending his military service, he attended the Georgetown Law School, graduating in 1947. He served as an assistant district attorney in Washington, D.C. and joined the firm of Rogers & Wells (now part of Clifford Chance), and relocated to the firm's Manhattan office in 1956. In 1971, the Nixon Administration sought to suppress publication of the Pentagon Papers, a top-secret history prepared by the United States Department of Defense documenting American political and military involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967, citing claims that publication of the classified material could cause irreparable injury to the national interest. On this basis court injunctions were issued to prevent publication of the material in these documents by The New York Times and The Washington Post. Together with Alexander M. Bickel who was serving as chief counsel for The Times, Glendon appeared before the Supreme Court of the United States in New York Times Co. v. United States to argue that the government should not be allowed to exercise prior restraint to prevent publication. Glendon argued in a response to Justice Byron R. White that \\"when you bring a case you are supposed to prove it, and when you come in claiming irreparable injury, particularly in this area of the First Amendment, you have a very, very heavy burden.\\"Staff. \\"Transcript of Oral Argument in Times and Post Cases Before the Supreme Court; Classification of Government Documents Discussed by Lawyers Before High Court Transcript of Arguments on the First Amendment Issue at the Court Hearing\\", The New York Times, June 27, 1971. Accessed January 4, 2009. The court, by a 6-to-3 majority, agreed. In the 1977 securities fraud case Santa Fe Industries Inc. v. Green, Glendon successfully argued that a party challenging a securities transaction permitted under state law must prove fraudulent deception and not just a breach of fiduciary responsibility. Glendon was elected as mayor of Scarsdale, New York in 1985. After a group of residents objected to a Nativity scene that had been displayed on municipal property by a private group as a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, the village trustees voted to prohibit its display. Glendon personally supported the cr√®che, but acting as the village's attorney he argued on behalf of the ban in a series of court cases. In 1985, the Supreme Court voted 4 to 4 with a ninth judge absent, keeping intact the reversal of the decision by the United States Court of Appeals which ruled that the village's ban amounted to an unconstitutional infringement on \\"religious speech\\", and allowing the cr√®che to be displayed after a five-year gap.Greenhouse, Linda. \\"Supreme Court Roundup; Restrictions on Religious Displays to Be Weighed \\", The New York Times, October 4, 1988.

UsesVeterinary= Deslorein is used in veterinary medicine. One commercial form of deslorelin acetate is marketed by Peptech with the brand name Ovuplant.Peptech official Ovuplant site Another form is available in the United States, Sucromate Equine,Thorne BioScience official Sucromate site which was FDA-approved for use in horses in November 2010.FDA Approval Release This is manufactured by Thorne BioScience LLC and was introduced to the United States market following the withdrawal of Ovuplant. The deslorelin products are currently approved for use in veterinary medicine and to promote ovulation in mares as part of the artificial insemination process. It is also used to stabilize high-risk pregnancies, mainly of livestock. Unlike other GnRH agonists, which are mainly used to inhibit luteinizing hormone and follicle- stimulating hormone by their ultimate downregulation of the pituitary gland, Deslorelin is primarily used for the initial flare effect upon the pituitary, and its associated surge of LH secretion. Suprelorin is a slowly releasing deslorelin implant used for chemical castration of dogs and ferrets. It is marketed by Virbac. Deslorelin is also used to treat benign prostate hyperplasia in dogs. PharmacologyPharmacokinetics= Bioavailability is almost complete. Chemistry Deslorelin is a synthetic analogue of naturally occurring gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). History Deslorelin was successfully trialed in the U.S. and was approved for veterinary use under certain circumstances. In Europe, it was approved for use in equine assisted reproduction.Deslorelin Acetate - European Medicines Agency Ovuplant was withdrawn from the U.S. market following issues with mares which did not become pregnant failing to return to estrus in a timely manner. Techniques were developed where the implant was removed 48 hours after implantation in the mare, however compounded biorelease Deslorelin products were at the time available as well as more commonly used ovulation promoters such as hCG, which did not produce the same failure effect. Upon \\"Sucromate Equine\\" receiving FDA-approval, the compounded products were no longer legally available within the U.S., however they remain available in Australia and New Zealand where an approved version is marketed. It is also being trialed in humans to study its efficacy in treatment of breast cancer in women, and in treating precocious puberty and congenital adrenal hyperplasia in male and female children. As of August 2011 this drug was not approved for general use outside the FDA-licensed functions in the U.S., other than within approved clinical trials. Orphan drug status has been designated in the U.S., though approval had not been issued as of 2011. Research Deslorelin was under development for the treatment of endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, precocious puberty, prostate cancer, and uterine fibroids in humans and reached phase III clinical trials for prostate cancer but development was discontinued for all of these indications by 2001.

An early courtroom drama, it depicts a trial by jury in which the defendant is reluctant, if not unwilling, to talk about the crime he has allegedly committed. In 1938 the novel was turned into a film of the same title. Plot introduction After the death, assumedly from cancer, of his former wife Mingo Swieter, Dr Sigismondo Deruga, a 46-year-old nose and throat specialist, is accused by the deceased woman's cousin, a Baroness, of having poisoned her. A post-mortem is performed, and indeed traces of curare are found in the woman's body. Deruga leaves his medical practice in Prague and travels to Munich, where his wife lived after their divorce, only to learn that rumour has it that he murdered Mingo Swieter out of greed, as he now stands to inherit a considerable fortune. Deruga on the other hand claims that he did not know he was the beneficiary of her will, and that he did not communicate with her in any way for the last seventeen years of her life. Also, he maintains that at the time of the murder he was unavailable for his patients not because he was travelling to Munich to kill his ex-wife but because he was spending three days in the flat of a woman whose name he refuses to disclose as he does not want to taint her reputation. Plot summary The novel opens with the beginning of the trial, which takes place in pre-1914 Munich. Right from the start Deruga, who has not been taken into custody so far, attracts the attention of everyone present through his conspicuous behaviour, which ranges from seemingly unmotivated emotional outbursts to complete indifference as to what is going on in the courtroom--at one point he even seems to have fallen asleep. Part of his idiosyncratic demeanour is attributed to his Italian ancestry--Deruga was born and raised in poor circumstances in an Italian mountain village and only came to Germany and Austria to read medicine-- but the rest is ascribed to his choleric temperament. As the trial proceeds, Deruga turns out to have been living a life somewhat outside the bourgeois society which would normally harbour people of his professional standing: he neglects his run-down practice, has debts not only with one of his colleagues but also with his restaurateur, tailor, and hairdresser, shuns the local medical society, and has frequent and irregular love affairs. While Deruga himself does not seem to care one way or another, there are clearly two opposing parties: one group, headed by the Baronin Truschkowitz, who feel strongly that a murderer must be brought to justice; and another, motley group of people who have crossed the defendant's path at some point in their lives and who, summoned to testify as character witnesses, insist that, despite his occasional rudeness, he has always been a witty, kind, sympathetic, helpful, even philanthropic, man whose lack of interest to accumulate money would never have induced him to kill his ex-wife on the sheer hope that he might be included in her will. They also point out his unblemished professional record, and therefore say that he must be acquitted. The discovery of a handwritten letter from Mingo Swieter to Deruga finally triggers a turn of events in Deruga's favour. It is found in the inside pocket of a man's suit which was carelessly thrown into a canal in Munich and retrieved by a poor woman who was going to sell it to a clothes peddler. In the letter, which is the first communication between the ex-spouses since their divorce, the dying woman appeals to Deruga to shorten her suffering by performing euthanasia on her. On the last day of the trial, Deruga at last explains how he received the letter, immediately took the train to Munich, disguised himself as a peddler, stole into Mingo Swieter's flat while her daily help was away on errands, talked to the dying woman, administered the poison, waited until she was dead, and travelled back to Prague, happy to have been able to assist his ex-wife in her hour of need. In the end Deruga is acquitted. The final chapters of the novel also throw some light on the individual characters' motives to act the way they do. Deruga's arch enemy, the Baronin Truschkowitz, who appears throughout the trial as an embittered and vengeful woman only out to get her cousin's inheritance, turns out to be a highly moral person trapped in a boring marriage who intended to use the money to buy her freedom from her dull husband now that their daughter Mingo has come of age. Neither her unfading beauty, which has not gone unnoticed by Deruga, nor her joie de vivre have ever tempted her to be unfaithful to her husband, but after her cousin's death she thought the time had come to divorce him. When she meets Deruga after the end of the trial, they are surprised to see that their attraction is mutual, and Deruga admits that she is the reason why he has decided to close down his practice and go abroad for good--as far away as humanly possible. Further complications arise when Mingo von Truschkowitz declares her love for Deruga, although he is 25 years her senior. The Baroness actually offers him her daughter's hand, but Deruga is too sensible to accept and sticks with his decision to move on.

Etymology L'Anse aux Meadows is a French-English name which can be translated as the bay with the grasslands. How the village itself came to be named \\"L'Anse aux Meadows\\" is debated. One possibility is that \\"L'Anse aux Meadows\\" is a corruption of the French designation ', which means \\"Jellyfish Cove\\".William B. Hamilton, The Macmillan book of Canadian place names, 2e √©dition (1978), Philip 118.Mentionn√© √©galement par Lawrence Millman dans Coins perdus : un parcours dans l'Atlantique nord (titre original : Last Places), Terres d'aventure, 1995 . The shift from ' to \\"Meadows\\" may have occurred because the landscape in the area tends to be open, with meadows.. A more recent supposition is that it is derived from \\"L'Anse √† la M√©d√©e\\", or \\"The Medea's Cove\\" , the name it bears on an 1862 French naval chart. Whether Medea or Medusa, it is possible that the name refers to a French naval vessel.Marie-julie Gagnon, Cartes postales du Canada, √©ditions Michel Lafon, Montr√©al, Qu√©bec, 2017 HistoryPre- European settlements= Before the Norse arrived in Newfoundland, there is evidence of aboriginal occupations in the area of L'Anse aux Meadows, the oldest dated at roughly 6,000 years ago. None were contemporaneous with the Norse occupation. The most prominent of these earlier occupations was by the Dorset people, who predated the Norse by about 200 years. =Norse site (c. 1000)= The 1590 Sk√°lholt Map showing Latinized Norse placenames in North America:http://www.myoldmaps.com/renaissance-maps-1490-1800/4316-skalholt- map/4316-skalholt-map.pdf ‚Ä¢ Land of the Risi (a mythical location) ‚Ä¢ Greenland ‚Ä¢ Helluland (Baffin Island) ‚Ä¢ Markland (the Labrador Peninsula) ‚Ä¢ Land of the Skr√¶lingjar (location undetermined) ‚Ä¢ Promontory of Vinland (the Great Northern Peninsula) The Norse settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows has been dated to approximately 1,000 years ago (carbon dating estimate 990‚Äì1050 CE), an assessment that tallies with the relative dating of artifact and structure types. Today the area mostly consists of open, grassy lands, but 1000 years ago there were forests that were convenient for boat-building, house-building and iron extraction. The remains of eight buildings (labeled from A‚ÄìJ) were found. They are believed to have been constructed of sod placed over a wooden frame. Based on associated artifacts, the buildings were identified as dwellings or workshops. The largest dwelling (F) measured and consisted of several rooms. Three small buildings (B, C, G) may have been workshops or living quarters for lower-status crew or slaves. Workshops were identified as an iron smithy (building J) containing a forge and iron slag, a carpentry workshop (building D), which generated wood debris and a specialized boat repair area containing worn rivets. Other things found at the site consisted of common everyday Norse items, including a stone oil lamp, a whetstone, a bronze fastening pin, a bone knitting needle and part of a spindle. Stone weights, which were found in building G, may have been part of a loom. The presence of the spindle and needle suggests that women as well as men inhabited the settlement. A model depicting the Norse settlement established at L'Anse aux Meadows. There is no way of knowing how many people lived at the site at any given time; archaeological evidence of the dwellings suggest it had the capacity of supporting 30 to 160 people. The entire population of Greenland at the time was about 2,500, meaning that the L'Anse aux Meadows site was less than 10 percent of the Norse settlement on Greenland. As Julian D. Richards notes: \\"It seems highly unlikely that the Norse had sufficient resources to construct a string of such settlements.\\" Food remains included butternuts, which are significant because they do not grow naturally north of New Brunswick. Their presence probably indicates the Norse inhabitants traveled farther south to obtain them. There is evidence to suggest that the Norse hunted an array of animals that inhabited the area. These included caribou, wolf, fox, bear, lynx, marten, all types of birds and fish, seal, whale and walrus. This area is no longer rich in game due in large part to the harsh winters. This forces the game to either hibernate or venture south as the wind, deep snow, and sheets of ice cover the area. These losses made the harsh winters very difficult for the Norse people at L'Anse aux Meadows. This lack of game supports archaeologists' beliefs that the site was inhabited by the Norse for a relatively short time. Eleanor Barraclough, a lecturer in medieval history and literature at Durham University, suggests the site was not a permanent settlement, instead a temporary boat repair facility. She notes there are no findings of burials, tools, agriculture or animal pens‚Äîsuggesting the inhabitants abandoned the site in an orderly fashion. According to a 2019 PNAS study, there may have been Norse activity in L'Anse aux Meadows for as long as a century. Connection with Vinland sagas Different sailing routes to Greenland, Helluland (Baffin Island), Markland (Labrador), and Vinland (Newfoundland) by the characters of the Sagas of Icelanders. Adam of Bremen, a German cleric, was the first European to mention Vinland. In a text he composed around 1073, he wrote that This excerpt is from a history Adam composed of the archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen who held ecclesiastical authority over Scandinavia (the original home of the Norse people) at the time. Norse sagas are written versions of older oral traditions. Two Icelandic sagas, commonly called the Saga of the Greenlanders and the Saga of Erik the Red, describe the experiences of Norse Greenlanders who discovered and attempted to settle land to the west of Greenland, which they called Vinland. The sagas suggest that the Vinland settlement failed because of conflicts within the Norse community, as well as between the Norse and the native people they encountered, whom they called Skr√¶lingar. Modern archaeological studies have suggested that the L'Anse aux Meadows site was not Vinland itself, but rather was within a larger area called Vinland, which extended south from L'Anse aux Meadows to the St. Lawrence River and New Brunswick. The L'Anse aux Meadows site served as an exploration base and winter camp for expeditions heading southward into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The settlements of Vinland mentioned in these two sagas, Leifsbudir (Leif Ericson) and H√≥p (Norse Greenlanders), have both been claimed as the L'Anse aux Meadows site. =Discovery and significance (1960‚Äì68)= Anne Ingstad at L'Anse aux Meadows, 1963. Anne, along with her husband, led an archeological excavation of the site. In 1960, the archaeological remains of Norse buildings were discovered in Newfoundland by the Norwegian husband-wife team of explorer Helge Ingstad and archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad. Based on the idea that the Old Norse name \\"Vinland\\", mentioned in the Icelandic Sagas, meant \\"wine-land\\", historians had long speculated that the region contained wild grapes. Because of this, the common hypothesis before the Ingstads' theories was that the Vinland region existed somewhere south of the northern Massachusetts coast, because that is roughly as far north as grapes grow naturally. This is a false assumption. Wild grapes have grown and still grow along the coast of New Brunswick and in the St. Lawrence River valley of Quebec.Wallace 2006:98‚Äì99 The archaeological excavation at L'Anse aux Meadows was conducted from 1960 to 1968 by an international team led by archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad. The remains of Norse buildings on display. The remains of seven Norse buildings were uncovered during the Ingstads' excavation of the site. The Ingstads doubted this theory, saying \\"that the name Vinland probably means land of meadows...and includes a peninsula.\\" This speculation was based on the belief that the Norse would not have been comfortable settling in areas along the American Atlantic coast. This dichotomy between the two views could have possibly been due to the two historic ways in which the first vowel sound of \\"Vinland\\" could be pronounced. The word used in the sagas clearly relates to grapes. In fact, the discovery of butternuts in the Norse stratum of the bog on the site by Parks Canada archaeologists proves that the Norse ventured at least as far as the coast of New Brunswick, where butternuts grow (and have grown for centuries) alongside wild grapes. The Norse thus would have had contact with the grapes of the sagas. In 1960, George Decker, a citizen of the small fishing hamlet of L'Anse aux Meadows, led Helge Ingstad to a group of mounds near the village that the locals called the \\"old Indian camp\\". These mounds covered with grass looked like the remains of houses. Helge Ingstad and Anne Stine Ingstad carried out seven archaeological excavations there from 1961 to 1968. They investigated the remains of eight buildings and the remains of perhaps a ninth. They determined that the site was of Norse origin because of definitive similarities between the characteristics of structures and artifacts found at the site compared to sites in Greenland and Iceland from around 1000 CE. L'Anse aux Meadows is the only confirmed Norse site in North America outside of Greenland. It represents the farthest-known extent of European exploration and settlement of the New World before the voyages of Christopher Columbus almost 500 years later. Historians have speculated that there were other Norse sites, or at least Norse-Native American trade contacts, in the Canadian Arctic. In 2012, possible Norse outposts were identified in Nanook at Tanfield Valley on Baffin Island, as well as Nunguvik, Willows Island and the Avayalik Islands. Point Rosee, in southwestern Newfoundland, shown by National Geographic and the BBC as a possible Norse site, was excavated in 2015 and 2016, without any evidence of a Norse presence being found. =National historic site (1968‚Äìpresent)= sod longhouse, north of the archaeological site. In November 1968, the Government of Canada named the archaeological site a National Historic Site of Canada. The site was also named a World Heritage Site in 1978 by UNESCO. After L'Anse aux Meadows was named a national historic site, the area, and its related tourist programs, have been managed by Parks Canada. After the first excavation was completed, two more excavations of the site were ordered by Parks Canada. The excavations fell under the direction of Bengt Schonbach from 1973 to 1975 and Birgitta Wallace, in 1976. Following each period of excavation, the site was reburied to protect and conserve the cultural resources. The national historic site remains of seven Norse buildings are on display. North of the Norse remains are reconstructed buildings, built in the late 20th century, as a part of a interpretive display for the national historic site. The remains of an aboriginal hunting camp is also located at the site, southwest of the Norse remains. Other amenities at the site includes picnic areas, and a visitor centre.

Career Born in Chatham, Kent, he adopted the stage name Bobby Valentino in 1975. Valentino's first success was as a founding member of The Fabulous Poodles, but he is most often recognised as the violinist and co-writer of the #1 hit single \\"Young at Heart\\", by The Bluebells. After leaving the Fabulous Poodles in the early 1980s, Valentino was a member of the Electric Bluebirds before joining the Hank Wangford Band at the beginning of 1984: the British country band already included pedal steel guitarist B. J. Cole (Cochise) and former Liverpool Scene/Scaffold/ guitarist Andy Roberts. In the five years that Valentino was part of Wangford's band they recorded three albums; filmed two TV series for Channel 4 ‚Äì The A-Z of C&W; and Big Big Country, which attracted audiences of between two and four million at a time when The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross was being watched by 750,000; performed and wrote an acclaimed and record breaking musical: C. H. A. P. S (Cowboy, Horseriding Acting Performance Studio) at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East (their previous record was held by Oh, What a Lovely War!); toured constantly all over the United Kingdom and Europe and made numerous other radio and television appearances. These included a TV special, Christmas in Strangeways showing the band in concert on Boxing Day with a captive audience in Manchester's Victorian jail. Valentino's violin can be heard on tracks by artists including: Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Bob Geldof, The Alabama 3 and Shania Twain. He is also an occasional member of Mark Knopfler's current band. He has contributed to many recordings by the British folk punk band The Men They Couldn't Hang as well as frequently appearing with them on stage. His own most recent band, Los Pistoleros, sees him teamed up once again with former Hank Wangford bandmates B. J. Cole and Martin Belmont. Valentino is lead singer and guitarist in addition to playing the violin. A part-time actor and model, Valentino has performed in West End musical theatre: in Destry Rides Again with Alfred Molina and Jill Gascoigne and in C.H.A.P.S. at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East. Occasionally he can be seen in films and commercials, usually taking the part of Clark Gable. Solo career Valentino has released three solo albums. You're in the Groove Jackson was recorded during 1990 in Livingstone Studios in Wood Green and GibsonWood Studios in Deptford and was released in 1991 on Big Life Records. The Airplay was significant that many people thought he had had a hit but the distributors, Rough Trade Records went bankrupt the week it was due in the shops. In 1996 You're Telling Me, which consisted of some new tracks and the best of You're in the Groove Jackson, was released by Vireo Records to critical acclaim and Valentino appeared at the 1996 South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas to launch the album. Again, the record company had distribution difficulties. The 2001 release, This is Murder, consisted of new tracks and previous recordings from the earlier recordings and appeared on E.M. Records. All three titles are quotes from the Bob Hope and Bing Crosby film musical, Road to Rio. A 4th album is due for release in June 2011 under the title of Pat-a-Cake, Pat-a-Cake ‚Äì another quote from Crosby and Hope. Valentino is currently working on an album of new material with the working title of 6 ft 3ins. Legal actions In 2002 Valentino won a court case against Robert Hodgens (aka Bobby Bluebell) of Scots pop band The Bluebells for unpaid royalties from his contribution to their 1993 hit \\"Young at Heart\\", co-written by Hodgens and Siobhan Fahey. Valentino's case hinged on convincing the judge that he, rather than Hodgens, had composed the song's distinctive violin part, and that the violin part made a significant enough difference to the song to be considered an original contribution. The song, first recorded by Bananarama in 1983, was then released by the Bluebells with the added violin part in 1984, reaching No. 8 in the UK Singles chart. Valentino was paid a session fee of ¬£75. However his claim against Hodgens only dated back to the time of the single's 1993 re- release and chart-topping performance on the back of a high-profile Volkswagen TV commercial. The court case attracted media attention after Valentino performed the violin part in court to illustrate his point, convincing Mr Justice Floyd to rule in his favour and award him damages of ¬£100,000. A subsequent appeal by Hodgens against the ruling was unsuccessful. In 2008 Valentino brought an action against the American R&B; singer Bobby Wilson (then billed as \\"Bobby Valentino\\") and his then record label Def Jam for \\"Passing off, Trade Mark infringement, and breach of contract, in relation to record sales, recorded content, and artist's live performances\\".

Description Mastigoproctus colombianus range from in length. Color brown and red-end legs. Like the related orders Schizomida, Amblypygi and Solifugae, uropygids use only six legs for walking, having modified their first two legs to serve as antennae-like sensory organs. Whip scorpions have no venom glands, but they do have glands near the rear of their abdomen that can spray a combination of acetic acid and octanoic acid when they are bothered. The acetic acid gives this spray a vinegar-like smell, giving rise to the common name vinegaroon. Behaviour Whip scorpions are carnivorous, nocturnal hunters feeding mostly on insects and millipedes, but sometimes on worms and slugs. Habitat Mastigoproctus colombianus are found in tropical and subtropical areas of Colombia. They usually dig burrows with their pedipalps, to which they transport their prey. They may also burrow under logs, rotting wood, rocks, and other natural debris. They enjoy humid, dark places and avoid the light.

Fuel systems differ greatly due to different performance of the aircraft in which they are installed. A single-engine piston aircraft has a simple fuel system; a tanker (such as the KC-135), in addition to managing its own fuel, can also provide fuel to other aircraft.Taylor 1990, p. 164. Fuel is piped through fuel lines to a fuel control valve (usually known as the fuel selector). This valve serves several functions. The first function is to act as a fuel shut-off valve. This is required to provide the crew with a means to prevent fuel reaching the engine in case of an engine fire. The second function is to allow the pilot to choose which tank feeds the engine. Many aircraft have the left tank and right tank selections available to the pilot. Some Cessna airplanes feed only from both tanks; and many have the option to feed from left, right, or both tanks. The reason to have left only and right only options is to allow pilots to balance fuel load to reduce the banking moment. In some aircraft, the shut-off function is a different valve located after the fuel selector valve. Typically, after the selector valve‚Äîsituated at a low point in the fuel run‚Äîthere is a gascolator ‚Äî a fuel filter that can be opened on the ground and drained of fuel impurities denser than petroleum, mainly water and sediment. Other drainage points are in each tank (often more than one contaminant collection sump per tank) and at the injection pump. Each tank is vented (or pressurised) to allow air into the tank to take the place of burned fuel; otherwise, the tank would be in negative pressure which would result in engine fuel starvation. A vent also allows for changes in atmospheric pressure and temperature. Single-engine aircraft gasoline fuel system  The fuel level indication system in the simplest form in aircraft is a transparent window on the tank side and in its usual application a float- driven potentiometer installed in the tank. After the TWA Flight 800 disaster, a revision was made to aircraft fuel systems to address the potential explosion hazard of electrical components located in the fuel tank. Single- engine piston aircraft fuel level systems moved to utilize float level gauges from the CNG and LPG industries which had the float drive a magnetic coupling and relocated the potentiometer outside the fuel tank. Some single-engine aircraft use capacitive probes in the fuel tanks. As fuel is burned, more air enters the tank and the capacitance increases; this is read by a computer and the fuel amount is calculated and displayed to the pilots. Magneto Resistive Level Sensor Recent advances in magnetoresistive technology have evolved new fuel level sensors for general aviation applications. This system is not affected by any additive or fuel combination to replace 100LL for piston- powered aircraft. Multi-engine aircraft fuel system  Adding tanks and engines increases the complexity of the fuel system and its management. Additional features found in multi-engine aircraft are: *Each wing tank often has its own electric boost fuel pump, and each engine has its own mechanical pump, replicating the fuel system described above for the single engine. *In case of single-engine operation, there is often a method incorporated to \\"cross-feed\\" the engine (left tank feeding right engine, or vice versa). *To balance asymmetric weight, flow valves and pumps often are used to feed both engines from one tank or simply to transfer fuel between tanks. Turbine fuel system All of the considerations made for the twin piston are applicable to turbine fuel systems. Additional consideration apply because of the higher altitudes, different fuel, lower temperatures, and longer flights. To avoid water condensation or the fuel itself solidifying at low temperatures (-55 ¬∞C), fuel tanks have thermometers and heating systems. Many are pressurized with engine bleed air to keep moist air out and ensure positive pressure feed to the pumps. In larger aircraft, fuel tanks also are in the fuselage and their load affects the center of gravity of the aircraft. This imposes limitations on the amount of fuel carried and the order in which fuel must be used. Turbine engines burn fuel faster than reciprocating engines do. Because fuel needs to be injected in to a combustor, the injection system of a turbine aircraft must provide fuel at higher pressure and flow compared to that for a piston engine aircraft. The refueling system of larger aircraft includes a single positive pressure refueling point from which all tanks can be fueled. How much and to which tanks fuel is fed during refueling operations is determined by the controls in the refueling panel, usually installed nearby and accessible to ground crews. External tanks External tanks are used to extend the range of an aircraft. Drop tanks are used by combat aircraft that need to discard them after use for performance reasons. To transfer fuel from the tip tank to the main tank on each side, there must be a fuel pump in the tip tank. ReferencesNotesBibliography= * Taylor, John W.R.

Life and career He belongs to the second generation of the movement initiated by the ‚ÄòGroup of Composers of Bahia‚Äô that was formed in 1966, launching a one-line manifesto ‚ÄúIn principle, we are against all and every asserted principle‚Äù. Lima, Paulo Costa, \\"Group of Composers of Bahia\\", In: Routledge Encyclopedia of Modernism, This manifesto also implies that all suggestions are valid and acceptable, and this inclusivity reflects the cultural diversity and relativity of Bahia - a society created by the encounter and conflict of three civilizations (European, African and Native American). Since 1992 his compositional interests addressed the rhythmic tradition of Afro-Bahian candombl√©, creating universes of hybridization and contradiction, non-sequitur and humor, involving Afro-Bahian and Avant-Garde contexts and ideas.

Composers of Bahia, Channel with video-scores . In recent years he has proposed the notion of compositionality ‚Äì the attributes of that which is composed ‚Äì involving at least five dimensions: i) the ‚Äòinvention of worlds‚Äô (i.e. universes of meaning); ii) the ‚Äòcommitment to critique‚Äô, in the sense that composition requires the construction of interpretation; iii) ‚Äòreciprocity‚Äô or playing with identities - the fact that the designer creates the design as much as the design creates the designer, see Laske (1991); iv) the continuous interaction between theory and practice, there is no such a thing as compositional practice, or theory-free composition; v) and a ‚Äòfield of choices‚Äô, the place in which all these perspectives manifest themselves as potential freedom. These same instances also take part of the analytical process, which he also classifies as creative thinking, not only the traditional conception of reducing the whole to its constituent parts, but also, and spetially, the challenge of identifying (i.e. composing) synthesis that respond to the top-down analytical work.

ABC da Funda√ß√£o Greg√≥rio de Mattos (2008) His administration designed new formats for popular participation such as the Program Mestres Populares da Cultura, which led to the identification and recognition of elderly people with wide knowledge of ethnic-popular traditions, being considered an important contribution to cultural policies and management in Bahia. For him, teaching, writing (texts and music) and management activities are unified by the compositional challenges they involve, closely connected to the political needs of present times. Two examples: in 2005 he organized a cultural manifestation involving 456 capoeira performers, walking and dancing on the streets of Salvador, in order to celebrate the anniversary of the city, but also the adoption of specific cultural policies, by the Ministry of Culture, for this important Bahian and Brazilian cultural activity; in 2001 he was the general Coordinator of a huge program of cultural activities in Salvador, as part of the SBPC Congress (Brazilian Society for the Progress of Science) Sociedade Brasileira para o Progresso da Ci√™ncia, reinforcing the ideal of proximity between arts and sciences.

In 2015, the National Foundation for the Arts (FUNARTE-Ministry of Culture) consulted around 120 Brazilian composers and conductors in order to prepare a list of 30 commissions for the XXIth Biennial of Brazilian Contemporary Music. He obtained the highest number of indications, being classified as the first prize, a clear demonstration of his national prestige and reputation. In 1976 he married Ana Margarida de Almeida Cerqueira Lima (violinist and also Professor of the School of Music - UFBA) and had two sons - Cl√°udio and Maur√≠cio.

To achieve an approximate form of the Bondi accretion rate, accretion is assumed to occur at a rate \\\\dot{M} \\\\simeq \\\\pi R^2 \\\\rho v, . Where: * \\\\rho is the ambient density * v is the object's velocity v_o or the sound speed c_s in the surrounding medium if v_o < c_s * R is the Bondi radius, defined as 2 G M / c_s^2. The Bondi radius comes from setting escape velocity equal to the sound speed and solving for radius. It represents the boundary between subsonic and supersonic infall. Substituting the Bondi radius in the above equation yields: \\\\dot{M} \\\\simeq \\\\frac{ \\\\pi \\\\rho G^2 M^2 }{c_s^3} . These are only scaling relations rather than rigorous definitions. A more complete solution can be found in Bondi's original work and two other papers.  Application to accreting protoplanets  When a planet is forming in a protoplanetary disk, it needs the gas in the disk to fall into its Bondi sphere in order for the planet to be able to accrete an atmosphere. For a massive enough planet, the initial accreted gas can quickly fill up the Bondi sphere. At this point, the atmosphere must cool and contract (through the Kelvin‚ÄìHelmholtz mechanism) for the planet to be able to accrete more of an atmosphere.

It is common on the North Island, and uncommon on the South Island. Description The banded tunnelweb spider (Hexathele hochstetteri) is among New Zealand‚Äôs largest spiders, growing up to 20 mm in body length, and is endemic to New Zealand. The easiest way to distinguish a banded tunnelweb spider is to look for the chevron design on its abdomen. The chevron pattern is described as being yellowish, whilst the rest of the abdomen is a darker brown colour. They also have an orange-brown carapace, and six spinnerets. It is these six spinnerets that ultimately distinguish Hexathele hochstetteri from other genera of Hexathelidae, such as Porrhothele, as they only have four spinnerets. Female banded tunnelweb spider eyes occupy around half their head space, whereas males differ, having slightly smaller lateral eyes. Banded tunnelweb spiders are part of the infraorder Mygalomorphae. Mygalomorphs are a relatively ancient kind of spider that have downward pointing fangs, which have been compared to pick axes. When biting, a tunnelweb spider will press down with these fangs rather than pince together laterally, a trait that is helpful when identifying the spider. Taxonomy Hexethele hochstetteri was first was described by the Austrian arachnologist Anton Ausserer in 1871, and placed in his newly created genus Hexethele. The specific epithet hochstetteri honours Ferdinand von Hochstetter, who brought a specimen back to Austria from New Zealand as part of the Novara expedition.  Distribution and habitat  The banded tunnelweb spider is endemic to New Zealand. Two genera of hexathelids are found in New Zealand, Hexathele and Porrhothele. Tunnel-dwelling spiders are found throughout New Zealand in a range of habitats including the coastlines, bushlines and mountainous areas. Specifically, the banded tunnelweb spider is most common in the upper north island of New Zealand, although they are also sometimes found further south. Other closely related species of Hexathelidae are found further south, but the banded tunnelweb spider is most common in the upper north island of New Zealand. = Habitat preferences = Banded tunnelweb spiders are often found on and under rocks and logs, but are predominantly found in small holes in tree trunks and rocks in which they build a silk tunnel. It is in these holes that they sit and wait for prey to move past the entrance, quickly striking at the opportunity for a meal. They are rarely seen outside these holes, and it is rare to see a female roaming about unless it is moving from one hole to another. Males can be seen roaming around when they are searching for a mate. Life cycle Little is known about the mating habits and reproductive timing of the banded tunnelweb spider, as it has proven difficult to observe them mating inside their silk tunnel constructs. It is assumed that mating takes place inside the burrow of the female spider, although there are no reported sightings of the actual mating taking place. The actual mating of the spiders is assumed to happen in the same fashion as it does with other closely related mygalomorphs. There has been one recorded sighting of the behaviors leading up to mating, although the actual mating was unsuccessful; it was observed that as the male approached the female‚Äôs burrow he outstretched his front pair of legs, exposing his reproductive organs, then whilst vibrating his outstretched legs he moved toward the female. In this instance the female was unresponsive to the male‚Äôs advances, and nothing eventuated from the encounter. When a female is impregnated she lays her eggs in early to mid summer, wrapping them in a loose silk egg sack that is stored near the entrance of her burrow. In approximately thirty days the spiderlings hatch and stay nearby in the mother's web before leaving to construct their own silky tunnel web close by. There is a lack of information on the actual lifespan of the spiders, although the lifespan of the males and females differ greatly. Once leaving their mother the males only have a matter of months to find a mate before they die, but females have been known to live up to six years in captivity, being able to moult their skin and reproduce multiple times. Diet and foraging Banded tunnelweb spiders are known to eat most types of small insects, waiting in the tunnel that they have constructed for prey to walk past the opening. At the entrance to their tunnel, they construct a swathe of silk, which serves as an indicator to when prey is moving past. Once an insect is captured it is dragged into the tunnel. From inspecting the remains found in their dwellings it has been observed that their diet consists mainly of beetles, millipedes and slaters, although they will attack and eat most arthropods. They have also been known to eat snails. Despite the armored defenses of a snail the banded tunnelweb spider are able to bite and drag them into their tunnels. Predators, parasites, and diseases As the banded tunnelweb spider is a relatively undocumented species, there is little to no information on the parasite species that live on the banded tunnelweb spider and the family Hexathelidae. It is known that rodents sometimes eat hexathelid spiders, although this is rare due to their sometimes painful bite. They are also hard to catch as they are usually very reclusive and will retreat inside their burrow at any sign of movement. Other information The banded tunnelweb spider is not dangerous to humans, although its bite can be painful; its venom does not affect people and will only cause some soreness and inflammation. Although large in size, the banded tunnelweb spider is extremely shy. Male banded tunnelweb spiders are sometimes found in sinks and bathtubs, as they may wander inside a home in search for a mate, fall in and become trapped. It is during this time when males are searching for a mate that they are most commonly seen. Although the bite from the banded tunnelweb spider does not cause any severe health complications for humans, it is very closely related to the Australian funnelweb spider, which can be dangerous. Throughout the world there are 85 known species of tunnelweb spider, 25 of those are found in New Zealand.

The SS unit nomenclature can be divided into several different types of organizations, mainly the early titles used by the SS, SS unit titles of the Allgemeine SS, the military formation titles used by the Waffen-SS, titles of commands associated with the SS Security Police, and special units titles used by such SS organizations as the mobile death squad units of the Einsatzgruppen. Early SS commands1920‚Äì1925= From 1920 through 1925, several early paramilitary terms were used to describe the various groups which would eventually become the SS. Among the most were: *Saal-Schutz (\\"Hall-Protection\\"): Formed at the end of 1920. It was a small permanent guard unit made up of NSDAP volunteers to provide security for Nazi Party meetings in Munich. It was disband after Hitler was sentenced to prison in 1924. *Stabswache (\\"Headquarters Guard\\"): Used by several units of the Freikorps, and then adopted by the forerunner of the SS. *Stosstrupp (\\"Shock Troops\\"): A carry over from World War I, early bodyguard unit of the fledgling Nazi Party. A forerunner of the SS bodyguard dedicated to Hitler's protection. *Schutzkommando (\\"Protection Command\\"): Also a title of the Freikorps, this was one of the early names for the SS before the unit adopted its final name of the Schutzstaffel, and was officially recognized in November 1925. =1925‚Äì1929= In September 1925, the then fledgling SS established its first organizational structure, using the following titles: *Oberleitung (\\"Senior Leadership\\"): This was the headquarters staff of the SS (then only a mere battalion of the Nazi Stormtroopers) and was headquartered in Munich. *SS-Gau (\\"SS-Region\\"): There were five SS-Regions established throughout Germany, headed by an SS leader known as an SS-Gauf√ºhrer (Region Leader). *SS-Staffel (\\"SS-Squadron\\"): These was the standard unit of the early SS in the late 1920s. An SS-Squadron contained a company of ten men, headed by an officer known as an SS-Staffelf√ºhrer (this title was quickly shortened to simply SS- F√ºhrer). =1929‚Äì1931= In January 1929, after Heinrich Himmler took over leadership of the SS, old organizational titles were done away with and the following terms came into being: *Oberstab (\\"Senior Staff\\"): This was the name of the SS headquarters, which was under Himmler's command as of January, 1929. *Abteilung (\\"Department\\"): The term Abteilung was used to describe the earliest form of the SS Main Offices and were considered subordinate offices attached to the Oberstab. The SS offices of 1929 encompassed administration, personnel, finance, security, and racial matters. *SS-Oberf√ºhrerbereiche (\\"Senior Leadership Area\\"): By 1930, the old SS-Gaus had been consolidated into three senior leadership areas encompassing east and west Germany (including northern areas of the country) and a region encompassing southern Germany which was considered the most important since this was the location of the main Nazi Party offices. Each Oberf√ºhrerbereich was commanded by an Oberf√ºhrer. =1931‚Äì1933= In 1931, as SS membership began to surpass 100,000, Himmler again reorganized the SS and created these new command titles: *SS-Amt (\\"SS-Office\\"): Originally in 1931 there were three SS offices; the Headquarters Office (SS-Amt), the Race Office (SS-Rasseamt) and the Security Office (Ic Dienst which became the Sicherheitsdienst in 1932). By 1933, these offices would be renamed under the title of Hauptamt which would remain the standard name for an SS main office for the duration of the group's existence. *SS-Gruppen (\\"SS-Groups\\"): These were the earliest division commands of what would become the Allgemeine SS. There were five SS-Groups originally established: North, South, East, West, and Southwest. Each SS-Group was commanded by a Gruppenf√ºhrer. *SS-Brigaden (\\"SS-Brigades\\"): The SS brigades were intermediary commands between the SS-Groups and lower SS regiment commands known as Standarte. Each SS-Brigade was commanded by a Brigadef√ºhrer. Allgemeine SS commands The core of the \\"General-SS\\" were the mustering formations spread throughout Germany, divided into several division sized formations and extending downwards into brigade, regiment, battalion, company, and squad like formations. Most of these formations were \\"part time\\" and mustered weekly or monthly without pay. The Allgemeine SS used unique names for these formations which were different from standard military terms in use by the German military. Initially, General-SS formations were operated strictly in Germany and Austria but were later formed in occupied countries during World War II. Most often, Allgemeine SS units in occupied territories were \\"paper commands\\", formed under the authority of an SS and Police Leader (who would serve as a dual commander) in order to give senior SS officers in occupation commands a command billet within the General-SS. * SS- Oberabschnitt (\\"SS-Senior District\\": This division level command was the main administrative district for the Allgemeine SS and the highest command level in the Allgemeine SS order of battle. The first Oberabschnitt were formed in the 1934 from the older SS-Gruppen units. A Oberabschnitt was usually commanded by a Gruppenf√ºhrer or Obergruppenf√ºhrer. Once World War II began, Oberabschnitt leaders typically served simultaneously as SS and Police Leaders (in occupied countries this was always the case). The Oberabschnitt commander was known by the title of \\"F√ºhrer\\" and was assisted by a staff which typically comprised departments encompassing training, medical affairs, as well as specialty commands such as SS-signals battalions and engineer units. * SS-Abschnitt (\\"SS-District\\"): The Abschnitt commands were formed in the early 1930s from the old SS-Brigades. The function and operation was essentially the same as with the Oberabschnitt, but the units were usually commanded by an SS- Brigadef√ºhrer or Oberf√ºhrer. SS-Abschnitt's were annotated in correspondence with Roman numerals while the Oberabschnitt commands were given proper names. As with the Oberabschnitt commanders, once World War II began many Abschnitt leaders became corresponding SS and Police Leaders for their areas. * SS- Standarte (\\"SS-Regiment\\"): The Standarten was the primary unit of the General- SS, named after the term for a \\"Regimental Standard\\", or flag. The Standarte were organized into regimental-sized formations each with its own number, but also were referred to by other names, such as location, a popular name, or an honorary title; generally SS or NSDAP members killed before the Nazis obtained national power. For example, the 18th SS-Standarte in K√∂nigsberg was named \\"Ostpreu√üen\\" while the 6th SS-Standarte of Berlin was named \\"Graham K√§mmer\\". There were 127 SS-Standarte. The standard rank for the Standarte Leader was that of Standartenf√ºhrer (colonel). * SS-Sturmbann (\\"SS-Storm Unit\\"): The Sturmbann commands were battalion formations within a Standarte, usually three or four in number. These units were commanded by either a Sturmbannf√ºhrer or Obersturmbannf√ºhrer. * SS-Sturm (\\"SS-Company\\"): The Sturm was the company- level formation of the General-SS and the most typical in which an average SS member would associate. Each Sturmbann had 3 to 5 of them. Company commanders usually rated a rank between Untersturmf√ºhrer and Hauptsturmf√ºhrer. * SS-Trupp (\\"SS-Troop\\"): SS-Troops were platoon-sized formations. Each Sturm had 3 to 4 of them. They were commanded by an SS non-commissioned officer initially known as a Truppf√ºhrer. After the Night of the Long Knives, the SS renamed its rank structure and each Trupp then fell under the command of one with the rank of Oberscharf√ºhrer and Hauptscharf√ºhrer. * SS-Schar (\\"SS-Squad\\"): SS-Squads were eight to ten man formations that served as the primary mustering unit within each SS-Company. There were 3 for each Trupp. Such units were commanded by an SS-Scharf√ºhrer with an Assistant Squad Leader rated as an Unterscharf√ºhrer. * SS-Rotte (\\"SS-Section\\"): This was the smallest unit of the General-SS. It usually consisted of four to five SS members. The SS-Section was commanded by an SS-Rottenf√ºhrer and consisted of SS troopers holding the rank of Mann or Sturmmann. =Cavalry commands= The Allgemeine SS also formed several cavalry commands, which were mainly intended to attract German nobility into the ranks of the SS. These formations were little more than equestrian riding clubs and, by the start of World War II, the General-SS Cavalry had mostly ceased to exist except for a handful of members. The command names of the General-SS cavalry were modeled after those of the regular mustering SS formations and were separate from the military cavalry terms of the Waffen-SS. * SS-Reiterabschnitt (\\"SS-Cavalry District\\"): Modeled in the same manner as the SS-Abschnitt commands, only nine of these commands were ever established. They commanded one or more SS-Reiterstandarte. This command level ended in 1936. Thereafter, the SS-Reiterstandarte were under each SS-Oberabschnitt. * SS-Reiterstandarte (\\"SS-Cavalry Regiment\\"): There were twenty-four cavalry regiments established by the Allgemeine SS. These units wore a special crossed lances unit insignia. in comparison to the regular Standarte which displayed a unit patch bearing the Standarten number. Waffen-SS commands The Waffen-SS used standard Army military unit titles, in the following hierarchy. * Army: Only two SS armies were ever established and contained primarily subordinate Regular Army commands * Corps: Several SS Corps existed; these commands were usually the highest operational position in the Waffen-SS * Division: There were 38 full divisions established in the Waffen-SS. Many late war SS divisions never reached full strength, some no larger in reality than a battalion. * Brigades: SS brigades were independently formed at the start of World War II, eventually merged into the higher divisions * Regiments: The main-stay combat unit of the Waffen-SS, typically commanded by an SS- Standartenf√ºhrer * Battalions: Subordinate to a regiment and the first of the \\"front line\\" operational combat units * Companies: Referred to as Kompanie * Platoons: Referred to as Zug * Squads: Referred to as Gruppe. This created an oddity in that a Waffen-SS squad leader (usually a junior NCO) was referred to as a Gruppenf√ºhrer when this title was also a rank equivalent to a lieutenant general. * Teams: Basic fire team formations of five to seven soldiers Senior SS commands By the mid-1930s, the SS leadership had grouped itself into two major senior commands which would last throughout World War II. The two most senior positions in the SS, apart from the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS, were the SS and Police Leaders and the SS Main Office Commanders. =SS and Police Leaders= A wartime office which was granted considerable power was that of the SS and Police Leader. This unique position was a command authority of every SS unit in a given geographical area. SS and Police leaders had control over administrative SS commands, Nazi concentration camps, security forces, and (as World War II progressed) certain units of the Waffen-SS. There were three levels of SS and Police Leaders, these being: * Supreme SS and Police Leader (H√∂chster SS- und Polizeif√ºhrer (H√∂SSPF)): These SS and Police Leaders had command over all SS units in a conquered country. There were only two such commands established, one in the Ukraine and the other in Italy. * Higher SS and Police Leader (H√∂herer SS- und Polizeif√ºhrer (HSSPF)): These commands held authority over a region, district, or state. They were \\"de facto\\" equal in power inside Germany to their \\"often nominal superior\\", the NSDAP regional Gauleiter. * SS and Police Leader (SS- und Polizeif√ºhrer (SSPF)): These SS commands were in charge or specific cities, usually important or significant ones. They were subordinate to the HSSPF. =Main office commands= By 1942 all activities of the SS were managed through twelve main offices. *Pers√∂nlicher Stab Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Hauptamt (Personal Staff of the Reich Leader SS) *SS-Hauptamt (Main Administrative Office; SS-HA) *SS- F√ºhrungshauptamt (SS Main Operational Office; SS-FHA) *Reichssicherheitshauptamt (Reich Main Security Office; RSHA) *Ordnungspolizei Hauptamt (Main Office of the Order Police; Orpo) *Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungshauptamt (Economic and Administration Main Office; SS-WVHA) *Hauptamt SS-Gericht (Main Office of SS Legal Matters) *SS-Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt (SS Office of Race and Settlement; RuSHA) *SS- Personalhauptamt (SS Personnel Main Office) *Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle (Racial German Assistance Main Office; VOMI) *SS-Schulungsamt (SS Education Office) *Hauptamt Reichskommissar f√ºr die Festigung Deutschen Volkstums (Main Office of the Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood; RKFDV) The hierarchy of command in the main offices was: * Office Chief (Chef): The Chief of a Main Office was referred to by the title of Chef followed by the office code. For instance, Reinhard Heydrich was known by the title Chef der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD (Chief of Security Police and SD) or CSSD, while serving as the overall office commander of the Reich Main Security Office. * Department Chief (Amtschef): The title of department chief was the most commonly used and held by countless SS officers and could be extended to sub-department heads, as well. For example, Heinrich M√ºller was department chief of the RSHA \\"Amt IV\\" (Dept. 4): the Gestapo. Adolf Eichmann was the commander of (Referat IV B4) or Sub-Department IV B4 that was the Gestapo's inner department of Jewish Affairs. He was known as the Amtschef, RSHA (IV-B4), and was M√ºller's subordinate. * Chief of Staff (Chef des Stabs): Each department typically had a Chief of Staff, known by the title \\"Chief of the Staff\\" to avoid confusion with the title \\"Stabschef\\", which was a rank of the Nazi stormtroopers. Below the level of Department heads existed a plethora of administrative and bureaucratic titles to indicate positions as Assistant Department Heads, staff officers, and other clerical duties within the various main offices. Security police commands The offices of the Gestapo in major towns and cities were known as \\"Stapo-Leitstellen\\". Smaller towns and some villages maintained smaller Gestapo offices known simply as \\"Stapostellen\\". The Sicherheitsdienst was organized in a different manner, grouped in SD- Abschnitte with smaller SD-Unterabschnitte commands (SD districts and sub- districts). Both the Gestapo, SD, and the similarly organized Kriminalpolizei were overseen by an SS Police official known as Inspektor des Sicherheitspolizei und SD. In occupied territories, this commander was known by the alternate title Befehlshaber. Death's Head commands The Totenkopfverb√§nde maintained a hierarchy of Nazi concentration camp titles, in the following order: * Kommandant * Lagerf√ºhrer * Rapportf√ºhrer * Blockf√ºhrer Special Unit commands The Einsatzgruppen were regimental sized death squads which were further sub-divided into Einsatzkommandos, which were company-sized formations.

A natural example of this phenomenon can be found in the gem opal, where spheres of silica assume a close-packed locally periodic structure under moderate compression.Darragh, P.J., et al., Opal, Scientific American, Vol. 234, p. 84, (1976) Bulk properties of a colloidal crystal depend on composition, particle size, packing arrangement, and degree of regularity. Applications include photonics, materials processing, and the study of self- assembly and phase transitions. A collection of small 2D colloidal crystals with grain boundaries between them. Spherical glass particles (10 Œºm diameter) in water. The connectivity of the crystals in the colloidal crystals above. Connections in white indicate that particle has six equally spaced neighbours and therefore forms part of a crystalline domain.  Introduction  A colloidal crystal is a highly ordered array of particles which can be formed over a long range (to about a centimeter). Arrays such as this appear to be analogous to their atomic or molecular counterparts with proper scaling considerations. A good natural example of this phenomenon can be found in precious opal, where brilliant regions of pure spectral color result from close-packed domains of colloidal spheres of amorphous silicon dioxide, SiO2 (see above illustration). The spherical particles precipitate in highly siliceous pools and form highly ordered arrays after years of sedimentation and compression under hydrostatic and gravitational forces. The periodic arrays of spherical particles make similar arrays of interstitial voids, which act as a natural diffraction grating for light waves in photonic crystals, especially when the interstitial spacing is of the same order of magnitude as the incident lightwave.  Origins  The origins of colloidal crystals go back to the mechanical properties of bentonite sols, and the optical properties of Schiller layers in iron oxide sols. The properties are supposed to be due to the ordering of monodisperse inorganic particles. Monodisperse colloids, capable of forming long-range ordered arrays, existing in nature. The discovery by W.M. Stanley of the crystalline forms of the tobacco and tomato viruses provided examples of this. Using X-ray diffraction methods, it was subsequently determined that when concentrated by centrifuging from dilute water suspensions, these virus particles often organized themselves into highly ordered arrays. Rod-shaped particles in the tobacco mosaic virus could form a two-dimensional triangular lattice, while a body-centered cubic structure was formed from the almost spherical particles in the tomato Bushy Stunt Virus. In 1957, a letter describing the discovery of \\"A Crystallizable Insect Virus\\" was published in the journal Nature. Known as the Tipula Iridescent Virus, from both square and triangular arrays occurring on crystal faces, the authors deduced the face-centered cubic close-packing of virus particles. This type of ordered array has also been observed in cell suspensions, where the symmetry is well adapted to the mode of reproduction of the organism.Watson, J.D., Molecular Biology of the Gene, Benjamin, Inc. (1970) The limited content of genetic material places a restriction on the size of the protein to be coded by it. The use of a large number of the same proteins to build a protective shell is consistent with the limited length of RNA or DNA content.Nobel Lecture: The Isolation and Properties of Crystalline TMV (1946) It has been known for many years that, due to repulsive Coulombic interactions, electrically charged macromolecules in an aqueous environment can exhibit long-range crystal-like correlations with interparticle separation distances often being considerably greater than the individual particle diameter. In all of the cases in nature, the same iridescence is caused by the diffraction and constructive interference of visible lightwaves which falls under Bragg‚Äôs law. Because of the rarity and pathological properties, neither opal nor any of the organic viruses have been very popular in scientific laboratories. The number of experiments exploring the physics and chemistry of these ‚Äúcolloidal crystals‚Äù has emerged as a result of the simple methods which have evolved in 20 years for preparing synthetic monodisperse colloids, both polymer and mineral, and, through various mechanisms, implementing and preserving their long-range order formation.  Trends  Colloidal crystals are receiving increased attention, largely due to their mechanisms of ordering and self-assembly, cooperative motion, structures similar to those observed in condensed matter by both liquids and solids, and structural phase transitions. Phase equilibrium has been considered within the context of their physical similarities, with appropriate scaling, to elastic solids. Observations of the interparticle separation distance has shown a decrease on ordering. This led to a re-evaluation of Langmuir's beliefs about the existence of a long-range attractive component in the interparticle potential.Russel, W.B., et al., Eds. Colloidal Dispersions (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1989) [see cover] Colloidal crystals have found application in optics as photonic crystals. Photonics is the science of generating, controlling, and detecting photons (packets of light), particularly in the visible and near Infrared, but also extending to the Ultraviolet, Infrared and far IR portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The science of photonics includes the emission, transmission, amplification, detection, modulation, and switching of lightwaves over a broad range of frequencies and wavelengths. Photonic devices include electro-optic components such as lasers (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) and optical fiber. Applications include telecommunications, information processing, illumination, spectroscopy, holography, medicine (surgery, vision correction, endoscopy), military (guided missile) technology, agriculture and robotics. Polycrystalline colloidal structures have been identified as the basic elements of submicrometre colloidal materials science. Ref.14 in Mangels, J.A. and Messing, G.L., Eds., Forming of Ceramics, Microstructural Control Through Colloidal Consolidation, I.A. Aksay, Advances in Ceramics, Vol. 9, p. 94, Proc. Amer. Ceramic Soc. (1984) Molecular self-assembly has been observed in various biological systems and underlies the formation of a wide variety of complex biological structures. This includes an emerging class of mechanically superior biomaterials based on microstructure features and designs found in nature. The principal mechanical characteristics and structures of biological ceramics, polymer composites, elastomers, and cellular materials are being re-evaluated, with an emphasis on bioinspired materials and structures. Traditional approaches focus on design methods of biological materials using conventional synthetic materials. The uses have been identified in the synthesis of bioinspired materials through processes that are characteristic of biological systems in nature. This includes the nanoscale self-assembly of the components and the development of hierarchical structures.  Bulk crystals  Aggregation = Aggregation in colloidal dispersions (or stable suspensions) has been characterized by the degree of interparticle attraction. For attractions strong relative to the thermal energy (given by kT), Brownian motion produces irreversibly flocculated structures with growth rates limited by the rate of particle diffusion. This leads to a description using such parameters as the degree of branching, ramification or fractal dimensionality. A reversible growth model has been constructed by modifying the cluster-cluster aggregation model with a finite inter-particle attraction energy. In systems where forces of attraction forces are buffered to some degree, a balance of forces leads to an equilibrium phase separation, that is particles coexist with equal chemical potential in two distinct structural phases. The role of the ordered phase as an elastic colloidal solid has been evidenced by the elastic (or reversible) deformation due to the force of gravity. This deformation can be quantified by the distortion of the lattice parameter, or inter-particle spacing. = Viscoelasticity = Periodic ordered lattices behave as linear viscoelastic solids when subjected to small amplitude mechanical deformations. Okano's group experimentally correlated the shear modulus to the frequency of standing shear modes using mechanical resonance techniques in the ultrasonic range (40 to 70 kHz). In oscillatory experiments at lower frequencies (< 40 Hz), the fundamental mode of vibration as well as several higher frequency partial overtones (or harmonics) have been observed. Structurally, most systems exhibit a clear instability toward the formation of periodic domains of relatively short-range order Above a critical amplitude of oscillation, plastic deformation is the primary mode of structural rearrangement. = Phase transitions = Equilibrium phase transitions (e.g. order/disorder), an equation of state, and the kinetics of colloidal crystallization have all been actively studied, leading to the development of several methods to control the self-assembly of the colloidal particles. Examples include colloidal epitaxy and space-based reduced-gravity techniques, as well as the use of temperature gradients to define a density gradient. This is somewhat counterintuitive as temperature does not play a role in determining the hard-sphere phase diagram. However, hard-sphere single crystals (size 3 mm) have been obtained from a sample in a concentration regime that would remain in the liquid state in the absence of a temperature gradient. = Phonon dispersion = Using a single colloidal crystal, phonon dispersion of the normal modes of vibration modes were investigated using photon correlation spectroscopy, or dynamic light scattering. This technique relies on the relaxation or decay of concentration (or density) fluctuations. These are often associated with longitudinal modes in the acoustic range. A distinctive increase in the sound wave velocity (and thus the elastic modulus) by a factor of 2.5 has been observed at the structural transition from colloidal liquid to colloidal solid, or point of ordering. = Kossel lines = Using a single body-centered cubic colloidal crystal, the occurrence of Kossel lines in diffraction patterns were used to monitor the initial nucleation and subsequent motion caused distortion of the crystal. Continuous or homogeneous deformations occurring beyond the elastic limit produce a 'flowing crystal', where the nucleation site density increases significantly with increasing particle concentration. Lattice dynamics have been investigated for longitudinal as well as transverse modes. The same technique was used to evaluate the crystallization process near the edge of a glass tube. The former might be considered analogous to a homogeneous nucleation event‚Äîwhereas the latter would clearly be considered a heterogeneous nucleation event, being catalyzed by the surface of the glass tube. = Growth rates = Small-angle laser light scattering has provided information about spatial density fluctuations or the shape of growing crystal grains. In addition, confocal laser scanning microscopy has been used to observe crystal growth near a glass surface. Electro-optic shear waves have been induced by an ac pulse, and monitored by reflection spectroscopy as well as light scattering. Kinetics of colloidal crystallization have been measured quantitatively, with nucleation rates being depending on the suspension concentration. Similarly, crystal growth rates have been shown to decrease linearly with increasing reciprocal concentration. = Microgravity = Experiments performed in microgravity on the Space Shuttle Columbia suggest that the typical face-centered cubic structure may be induced by gravitational stresses. Crystals tend to exhibit the hcp structure alone (random stacking of hexagonally close-packed crystal planes), in contrast with a mixture of (rhcp) and face-centred cubic packing when allowed sufficient time to reach mechanical equilibrium under gravitational forces on Earth. Glassy (disordered or amorphous) colloidal samples have become fully crystallized in microgravity in less than two weeks.  Thin films  Two-dimensional (thin film) semi- ordered lattices have been studied using an optical microscope, as well as those collected at electrode surfaces. Digital video microscopy has revealed the existence of an equilibrium hexatic phase as well as a strongly first- order liquid-to-hexatic and hexatic-to-solid phase transition. These observations are in agreement with the explanation that melting might proceed via the unbinding of pairs of lattice dislocations. = Long-range order = Long-range order has been observed in thin films of colloidal liquids under oil‚Äîwith the faceted edge of an emerging single crystal in alignment with the diffuse streaking pattern in the liquid phase. Structural defects have been directly observed in the ordered solid phase as well as at the interface of the solid and liquid phases. Mobile lattice defects have been observed via Bragg reflections, due to the modulation of the light waves in the strain field of the defect and its stored elastic strain energy. = Mobile lattice defects = All of the experiments have led to at least one common conclusion: colloidal crystals may indeed mimic their atomic counterparts on appropriate scales of length (spatial) and time (temporal). Defects have been reported to flash by in the blink of an eye in thin films of colloidal crystals under oil using a simple optical microscope. But quantitatively measuring the rate of its propagation provides an entirely different challenge, which has been measured at somewhere near the speed of sound.  Non-spherical colloid based crystals  Crystalline thin-films from non-spherical colloids were produced using convective assembly techniques. Colloid shapes included dumbbell, hemisphere, disc, and sphero-cylinder shapes. Both purely crystalline and plastic crystal phases could be produced, depending on the aspect ratio of the colloidal particle. The low aspect ratio, such as bulge, eye-ball, and snowman-like non-spherical colloids, which spontaneously self-assembled to photonic crystal array with high uniformity. The particles were crystallized both as 2D (i.e., monolayer) and 3D (i.e., multilayer) structures. The observed lattice and particle orientations experimentally confirmed a body of theoretical work on the condensed phases of non-spherical objects. Assembly of crystals from non-spherical colloids can also be directed via the use of electrical fields.  Applications  Photonics = Technologically, colloidal crystals have found application in the world of optics as photonic band gap (PBG) materials (or photonic crystals). Synthetic opals as well as inverse opal configurations are being formed either by natural sedimentation or applied forces, both achieving similar results: long-range ordered structures which provide a natural diffraction grating for lightwaves of wavelength comparable to the particle size. Novel PBG materials are being formed from opal-semiconductor-polymer composites, typically utilizing the ordered lattice to create an ordered array of holes (or pores) which is left behind after removal or decomposition of the original particles. Residual hollow honeycomb structures provide a relative index of refraction (ratio of matrix to air) sufficient for selective filters. Variable index liquids or liquid crystals injected into the network alter the ratio and band gap. Such frequency-sensitive devices may be ideal for optical switching and frequency selective filters in the ultraviolet, visible, or infrared portions of the spectrum, as well as higher efficiency antennae at microwave and millimeter wave frequencies. = Self-assembly = Self-assembly is the most common term in use in the modern scientific community to describe the spontaneous aggregation of particles (atoms, molecules, colloids, micelles, etc.) without the influence of any external forces. Large groups of such particles are known to assemble themselves into thermodynamically stable, structurally well- defined arrays, quite reminiscent of one of the 7 crystal systems found in metallurgy and mineralogy (e.g. face-centered cubic, body-centered cubic, etc.). The fundamental difference in equilibrium structure is in the spatial scale of the unit cell (or lattice parameter) in each particular case. Molecular self-assembly is found widely in biological systems and provides the basis of a wide variety of complex biological structures. This includes an emerging class of mechanically superior biomaterials based on microstructural features and designs found in nature. Thus, self-assembly is also emerging as a new strategy in chemical synthesis and nanotechnology. Molecular crystals, liquid crystals, colloids, micelles, emulsions, phase-separated polymers, thin films and self-assembled monolayers all represent examples of the types of highly ordered structures which are obtained using these techniques. The distinguishing feature of these methods is self-organization.

Peterson first came to the Giants in September 1962 after a stalwart season with the El Paso Sun Kings of the Double-A Texas League, batting .335 with 29 home runs, 130 runs batted in and an OPS of 1.013. But he never won a regular job with San Francisco and was traded to the Senators in December 1966 in a multi-player transaction that sent future National League Cy Young Award winner Mike McCormick back to the Giants. Peterson appeared in a career-high 122 games for the 1967 Senators, but he batted only .240 with eight home runs and 46 RBI in 405 at bats. During the 1969 season with the Indians, Peterson was reunited with Alvin Dark, the former Giants manager, and he served as a reserve outfielder and pinch-hitter. Overall, he appeared in 536 MLB games, and batted .230, with 269 hits in 1,170 at bats. Peterson played three years of Triple-A baseball after his MLB career ended, retiring after the 1972 season to join his family's construction business.

It has an extensive and well-distributed system of parks that act as venues for a wide array of events and urban life. As a supplement to the regular parks, there are a number of congenial public gardens and some cemeteries doubling as parks. It is official municipal policy in Copenhagen that all citizens by 2015 must be able to reach a park or beach on foot in less than 15 minutes.En gr√∏n og bl√• storby, K√∏benhavns Kommune Parks The Hercules Pavilion seen from the distance King's Garden the garden of Rosenborg Castle, is the oldest and most visited park in Copenhagen. Its landscaping was commenced by Christian IV in 1606. Every year it sees more than 2.5 million visitors, and in the summer months it is packed with sunbathers, picknickers and ballplayers. It also serves as a sculpture garden with a permanent display of sculptures as well as temporary exhibits during summer. Just north of King's Garden a series of parks make up a green strand running right through the centre of the city. These are constructed on the old ramparts of the city and include √òstre Anl√¶g and √òrsted Park as well as the Botanical Garden which is particularly noted for a large complex of 19th-century greenhouses donated by Carlsberg founder J. C. Jacobsen. F√¶lledparken in the northern part of the city is, at 58 hectares, the largest park in Copenhagen. It is popular for sports and hosts an array of annual events, including a free opera concert at the opening of the opera season, other open-air concerts, carnival, Labour Day celebrations and the Copenhagen Historic Grand Prix, which is a race for antique cars. Another popular park is the Frederiksberg Gardens which is a 32-hectare romantic landscape park. It houses a large colony of very tame grey herons along with other waterfowl. The park also offers views of the elephants and the elephant house, designed by the world-famous British architect Norman Foster, at the adjacent Copenhagen Zoo. Some of Copenhagen's newer parks draw from their position by the water. Havneparken established in 1995, covers 2.8 hectares of dockland in the Islands Brygge neighbourhood and has a bandstand roofed by an upside-down old wooden ship, as well as the first of Copenhagen's harbour baths. Amager Beach Park was founded in 1934, but in 2005 a 2.4-kilometre-long artificial island was added, separated from the original beach by a lagoon crossed by three bridges. It is official municipal policy in Copenhagen that all citizens by 2015 must be able to reach a park or beach on foot in less than 15 minutes. In line with this policy, several new parks are under development in areas poor in green spaces.

Cemeteries Inside the Assistens Cemetery Characteristic of Copenhagen is that a number of cemeteries double as parks, though only for the more quiet activities such as sunbathing, reading and meditation. Assistens Cemetery the burial place of Hans Christian Andersen among others, is an important green space for the district of Inner N√∏rrebro and a Copenhagen institution. The lesser-known Vestre Cemetery is, at 54 hectares, the largest cemetery in Denmark and offers a maze of dense groves, open lawns, winding paths, hedges, overgrown tombs, monuments, tree-lined avenues, lakes and other garden features.

It was also the first plant to use the Lurgi process in the Southern Hemisphere.  History  The first of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere, the plant was constructed in the late 1930s to convert otherwise unusable low- quality coal from the nearby Rotowaro Coal Mines into carbon briquettes, which were then used for domestic heating. The coal was carbonised using the Lurgi process, the result being coke and charcoal, with tar and creosote as by- products. The tar was used with the char to create the briquettes. Waste from the plant was discharged directly into the nearby Awaroa stream, which caused heavy pollution of the waterway. Following complaints about the pollution, Waikato Carbonisation Limited trialed a waste incineration programme, but the output of the plant exceeded the capacity of the burners. The excess was pumped into waste pools up until the plant's closure in 1985, when major fire caused a retort to explode. Various ownership changes lead to the complete abandonment of the plant. The plant currently sits on land administered by the Public Trust. Due to the historic nature of the site, the plant is classed as a Category I Historic Place by the Historic Places Trust.Historic Places Trust - Site No 4171  Pollution and Cleanup  After the plant's closure, the plant was owned jointly by the Ministry of Energy and New Zealand Steel. Following the private sale of NZ Steel, the land on which the plant was located passed onto the local regional administration. An environmental evaluation of the site in the 1990s showed that the degree of contamination was at a hazardous level. As a result, Environment Waikato completed a cleanup of the site,Environment Waikato - Cleanup Report and removed all chemicals that posed a risk to human health or to the environment.

Description The National Association of Therapeutic Schools and Programs listed 140 schools and programs as of 2005. The market for this industry appears to be expanding: Educational consultant Lon Woodbury has stated \\"All indications are that the market is still growing. The consensus is that increasing numbers of children are in trouble and are not growing up very well.\\" Therapeutic boarding schools aim to promote growth and learning for their students in a long-term model. Accreditation Therapeutic boarding schools may be accredited by an academic accreditation body, such as the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, AdvanceED divisions, and National Independent Private Schools Association. The National Association of Therapeutic Schools and Programs (NATSAP) is a non-profit association of state-licensed or nationally- accredited therapeutic programs. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) advises that several independent nonprofit organizations, such as the Joint Commission (JACHO), the Council on Accreditation (COA), and the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) accredit mental health programs and providers.  Criticisms  Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, a disability rights organization, opposes placement in therapeutic boarding schools, equating them with residential treatment centers. The organization questions the appropriateness and efficacy of group placements, citing failure of some programs to address problems in the child‚Äôs home and community environment, lack of mental health services, and substandard educational programs. Concerns specifically related to private therapeutic boarding schools include inappropriate discipline techniques, medical neglect, restricted communication (such as lack of access to child protection and advocacy hotlines), and lack of monitoring and regulation. Bazelon promotes community-based services on the basis that they are more effective and less costly than residential placement. From late 2007 through 2008, a coalition of medical and psychological organizations that included members of Alliance for the Safe, Therapeutic and Appropriate use of Residential Treatment (ASTART) and the Community Alliance for the Ethical Treatment of Youth (CAFETY), provided testimony and support that led to the creation of the Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens Act of 2008 by the United States Congress Committee on Education and Labor. The U.S. Government Accountability Office Report has reported on negligence at residential treatment programs including wilderness therapy, boot camps, and academies: > GAO reviewed thousands of allegations of abuse, some of which involved > death, at residential treatment programs across the country and in American- > owned and American-operated facilities abroad between the years 1990 and > 2007.

He originally figures in literature the father of the knight Maleagant, who abducts King Arthur's wife Queen Guinevere in several versions of a popular episode. Bagdemagus first appears in French sources, but the character may have developed out of the earlier Welsh traditions of Guinevere's abduction, an evolution suggested by the distinctively otherworldly portrayal of his realm. He is portrayed as a kinsman and ally of Arthur and a wise and virtuous king, despite the actions of his son. In later versions, his connection to Maleagant disappears altogether. Origins King Bagdemagus first appears in Old French works of the late 12th century, but the principal episode in which he appears, the story of the abduction of Guinevere, developed out of significantly older traditions. Caradoc of Llancarfan's early 12th-century Latin Life of Gildas includes an episode in which Guinevere is kidnapped and taken to the \\"Isle of Glass\\", glossed as Glastonbury Tor, by Melwas, King of the \\"Summer Country\\". This Melwas is generally understood to be the original of Maleagant, Bagdemagus' son in the French works. Some other texts testify to the early popularity of this story; a version of it is alluded to in the Welsh poem known as \\"The Dialogue of Melwas and Gwenhyfar\\", which survives in two variants,Williams, p. 39. and a \\"Meloas\\", lord of the Isle of Glass, is mentioned in Chr√©tien de Troyes' French romance Erec and Enide.Erec and Enide, line 1944. Some writers have suggested that Bagdemagus should be identified with Baeddan, mentioned as the father of \\"Maelwys\\" in the early 12th-century Welsh romance Culhwch and Olwen. This identification relies on the suggestion proposed by E. K. Chambers that Maelwys is an alternate spelling of Melwas. However, this suggestion is rejected by Rachel Bromwich and Simon Evans, among others, who instead connect Maelwys with the historical Irish prince M√°el Umai, son of B√°et√°n mac Muirchertaig.Bromwich and Evans, p. 69. Ren√© Bansard looked on similar legends between king Baudemagus and hagiography of B√¥mer alias Bohamadus in Normandy near Gorron (possibly Gorre of the Arthurian romance), honoured in several parishes. Appearances The character is first mentioned in the 12th century in Chr√©tien de Troyes' Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart, where Bagdemagus (Bagomed√©s) is the king of Gore, a mysterious land connected to Logres only by a bridge as sharp as a sword, where many natives of Logres are kept prisoner; again, his son Maleagant abducts Guinevere, who is later rescued by the hero Lancelot. In the romance Sone de Nansai, Bagdemagus (Baudemagus) is said to be the father of Meleagant and the son of Tadus. The attributed arms of \\"Baudemagu\\" in prose romances The story is repeated, without its supernatural overtones, in the later Vulgate Cycle; King Bagdemagus (various spellings) is presented as a cousin of Gawain and a friend of Lancelot, who condemns his son's evil deeds and acknowledges that his death at the hands of Lancelot was deserved. In the Vulgate Lancelot, Bagdemagus joins the Round Table by taking the seat that had belonged to Ganor who was accidentally killed by Lancelot in a jousting tournament. Bagdemagus is the King of Gorre at the same time as when Morgan le Fay is described as the Queen of Gorre and lives there, but the connection between their characters and their status is not explicitly explained. In Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, the link between Bagdemagus and \\"Sir Meleagraunce\\" disappears, and Bagdemagus is just another knight of the Round Table, linked to Malory's version of Galehaut, until he is accidentally killed by Gawain at a tournament. In both de Troyes and Malory, Bagdemagus also has an unnamed daughter who is an ally and friend of Lancelot, aiding his escape from respectively either Maleagant or Morgan le Fay in return for his helping her at another time. In Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart, she is mentioned as one of his daughters, suggesting that Bagdemagus has at least three children altogether. King Bagdemagus is a very different character in the Post-Vulgate Cycle, in which he is a companion of Gawain and Yvain. Previously, he had also been the one who discovered the fate of Merlin in the course of his knight errant adventures. Bagdemagus fights for Arthur against King Claudas. He also comes close to being cruelly killed by King Pellinore when the latter finds out about the romance of Bagdemagus and his wife, but he is rescued by Gaheris. His death takes place in the Post-Vulgate Queste, after he discovers Mordred raping a young girl and then wounds him in a duel. Gawain, not knowing the identity of the knight who injured his brother, pursues Bagdemagus and gives him a mortal injury, but then despairs upon discovering the truth; Bagdemagus forgives Gawain before dying. In the Stanzaic Morte Arthur, Bagdemagus survives the Grail Quest and joins Lancelot's faction against Arthur in the civil war over Guinevere. ReferencesSources *Bromwich, Rachel, and Evans, D.

Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1048-1049. Built for Theodore Lindsey, the Lindsey Building was constructed in 1917 at a time when Dayton was highly prosperous. During the late 1910s, the downtown was experiencing sustained growth, and numerous commercial buildings such as the Lindsey were being constructed. For much of its history, it has housed financial institutions, including the Miami Savings and Loan Company and the Mutual Home and Savings Association. In 1985, the Lindsey Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places; by the early 2010s, it was one of approximately one hundred such locations in the city of Dayton.

The Creek originated in the Southeastern United States, in what is now Alabama and Georgia. They were collectively removed from the southeast to Indian Territory under the United States' Indian Removal Policy of the 1830s. Before 1832, the Thlopthlocco Tribal Town split from a larger town.

(retrieved 20 July 2011) During the American Civil War, Thlopthlocco Tribal Town was briefly the headquarters of Confederate Col. Douglas H. Cooper. Greenleaf Town, located five miles northwest of Thlopthlocco, was the headquarters of Opothleyahola, a Muscogee leader who worked to resolve conflicts between the Creek factions during the war. He and 5000 others moved north to Kansas to avoid the Civil War. After the war, the Muscogee Creek collectively signed the 1866 Treaty with the United States and freed their slaves. The treaty also called for the Creek Freedmen to have membership in the Muscogee Nation. The freedmen settled new townships in Okfuskee County, including Boley, Bookertee, Clearview, Chilesville, and Rusk. Thlopthlocco Tribal Town retained its tribal identity despite allotments of land to individual households under the Dawes Commission of 1896. From 1898-1906, members among the Five Civilized Tribes were registered on what have come to be known as the Dawes Rolls. After making allotments to households registered with the tribes, the US government declared other formerly tribal land as surplus and sold it to European- American settlers after 1906. This further broke up tribal communal territory. The Thlopthlocco Tribal members organized as a distinct tribe under the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of 1936, which followed the national Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. The original headquarters for the tribe was the Thlopthlocco Methodist Episcopal Church, located between Wetumka and Okemah.

Reception Fears were expressed in the build-up to the launch of the show that it would be the subject of much criticism. RT√â did not send out any advance tapes to the press Reviews of the show were negative. John Boland of the Irish Independent, was unamused with the \\"lame delivery\\" and the lack of a good script. It also failed to generate any great public interest, and was watched by an exceptionally small numbers of viewers. A show source was reported to have expressed the discomfort felt by the actors after encountering the newscasters, weather people and presenters they are parodying in the RT√â canteen, with one such incident occurring in the corridor outside the studio directly after the professional in question was filmed for the first episode. Complaints against the show were subsequently upheld by Ireland's Broadcasting Commission on the grounds of its poor taste in featuring terminally-ill children for comic effect. The first programme attracted 89,000 viewers, according to RT√â. The second programme led to a decrease in viewing figures to 76,00o, and the viewership stayed very low for the remainder of the series. Praise One of the few people to praise the show was the former TV3 television presenter Lorraine Keane who was apparently parodied in it. She thought her character was \\"hilarious\\". The Evening Herald also noted the show's improvement towards the end of its run, believing that a few of the jokes in the final episode were \\"sharper than usual\\", and praised the \\"decent\\" idea of having Hansom copying \\"a Peter Finch-in-Network and getting the sack\\". (Of course, In Network the character played by Peter Finch does not end up getting the sack - but is actually assassinated.)

He held the post of Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Serbia on two occasions, post of minister of education on three occasions, minister of interior on one occasion and leading the foremost liberal political party of that time in Serbia, the Progressive Party. He was also one of the most successful and skilled Serbian diplomats, holding the post of envoy to Constantinople, Paris, Vienna and Saint Petersburg. Noted intellectual, Stojan Novakoviƒá was the president of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, head of the National Library the first president and a founding member of Srpska knji≈æevna zadruga, Professor at the Belgrade's Grande √©cole, member of Serbian, Yugoslav, French, Czech, Polish and Russian academies.Koviƒá, Milo≈°, Srbi 1903-1914: Istorija ideja, Clio, Belgrade, 2015., , p. 471. Stojan Novakoviƒá is considered one of the foremost Serbian historians of the nineteenth century and one of the founders of modern Serbian historiography. Scholarly career Novakoviƒá was the first Serbian-educated scholar of the 19th century that obtained international renown. After finishing his secondary education in Belgrade (1860), he studied law and philosophy until 1863 at the Belgrade Lyceum (') that was eventually transformed into the Belgrade's Grandes √©coles ('). In 1865 he became a professor in this Belgrade institution of higher learning. By 1872 he was the librarian of the National Library and curator of the National Museum in Belgrade. As a young scholar, he was founder and editor of the journal Vila (Fairy Lady) that was published from 1865 to 1868. In the early years of his scholarly engagement, Novakoviƒá translated into Serbian Leopold von Ranke's monumental work Die Serbische Revolution, as well as its revised and updated edition (1864‚Äì1892) as well as the equally famous Histoire de Charles XII by Voltaire (1897) and Joseph Scherr, General History of Literature from German (1872‚Äì1874). An admirer of Adam Mickiewicz, Novakoviƒá translated into Serbian his famous poem Gra≈æyna in 1886 and the famous poem \\"The Captive of the Caucasus\\" by Alexander Pushkin. Stojan Novakoviƒá was one of the founders and first president of the Serbian Literary Cooperative in 1892, a prestigious publishing house for the most important literary and historical works. He was strongly influenced by internationally renowned professors of Slavic philology and literature, in particular by Pavel Jozef ≈†af√°rik, who was living and working in Serbia at the time, and ƒêura Daniƒçiƒá, the translator of the Bible into the vernacular. Under the influence of Daniƒçiƒá, Novakoviƒá wrote \\"The History of Serbian Literature,\\" (Istorija srpske knji≈æevnosti) in 1867 (revised in 1871), and compiled also the first \\"Serbian Bibliography\\" (Srpska bibliografija za noviju knji≈æevnost, 1741‚Äì1867) in 1869, published by the Serbian Learned Society, which resulted in him becoming a corresponding member of the Yugoslav Academy in Zagreb in 1870. He prepared simplified, but complete manuals for Serbian grammar that were widely published and used in various schools. A portrait of Novakoviƒá by Uro≈° Prediƒá In 1865 Novakoviƒá was elected member of Serbian Learned Society in Belgrade, the precursor of the Serbian Royal Academy (), officially founded in 1886. When the Serbian Royal Academy was founded Novakoviƒá was made one of its 16 initial members, while in 1906 he became President of the Academy, a position he held until his death in 1915. It was at the initiative of Novakoviƒá that the Serbian Royal Academy started comprehensive research and collection of various materials available throughout the Serb-inhabited Balkans for the Great dictionary of Serbian literary language. Although a disciple of ƒêura Daniƒçiƒá, who was concentrated primarily on linguistic issues, Novakoviƒá managed to expand the field of research, establishing a multi-disciplinary approach in treating all the social sciences related to national history, culture and tradition. The early works of Novakoviƒá were mainly on poetry and literature, including his own early poetry (Pevanija, 1862) and attracted minor interest, as did his early novels (Nesreƒáni andjelak, Kob, Lepa Nereƒáanka, Vampir, Kaludjer) written between 1862 and 1865. Novakoviƒá was the Serbian counterpart to the prominent Slavist scholars, philologists such as Czech Dobrovsk√Ω or ≈†af√°rik among Slovaks, Jernej (Bartholomeus) Kopitar and Franz Miklosich among Slovenians, and Vatroslav Jagiƒá among Croats. A scholar of Renaissance knowledge and interest, Novakoviƒá was able to use sources published in a dozen Slavic languages, as well as the growing literature in French, English, and German. After learning Latin and Greek, Novakoviƒá, already established as a promising scholar in Slavic literature and linguistics, was able to use medieval sources for his extensive historical research on medieval Serbia and the Balkans. His first major study on historic geography, published in 1877, covered the reign of Stefan Nemanja (Zemlji≈°te radnje Nemanjine). His major work on medieval Serbia, the monograph on late Nemanjiƒá period (Serbs and Turks in 14th and 15th centuries), was published in 1893, while his other important works based on unused documents including the studies of pronoia (Pronijari i ba≈°tinici) from 1887, village life in the medieval epoch (Selo), a comprehensive social and historical study, from 1891, and The Old Serbian Army (Stara srpska vojska), from 1893, as well as a study on medieval Serbian capitals in Rascia and Kosovo (Nemanjiƒáke prestonice: Ras, Pauni, Nerodimlje), published in 1911, were considered as chapters of the comprehensive, multi-volume monograph The People and the Land in the Old Serbian State (Zemlja i narod u staroj srpskoj dr≈æavi) which was never fully completed. The comprehensive volume of medieval documents under the title Legal Documents of Serbian Medieval States (Zakonski spomenici srpskih dr≈æava srednjeg veka), from 1912, still stands as the main source on the subject for medieval Serbia (Rascia), Bosnia, and Dioclea (Zeta). Another major volume is a scholarly edition of the Serbian Emperor Stefan Du≈°an's Code (Zakonik Stefana Du≈°ana cara srpskog), based on the manuscript found in Prizren, and a work on the Byzantine legal sources of Serbian medieval law (Matije Vlastara Sintagmat), a subject he treated on several occasions. His other studies, also based on primary sources and available literature in various languages, covered the modern period, prior and during the Serbian revolution (1804‚Äì1835): The Ottoman Empire prior to the Serbian Insurrection, 1780-1804 (Tursko carstvo pred srpski ustanak 1780-1804), The Resurrection of Serbia (Vaskrs dr≈æave srpske) in 1904 (translated into German and published in Sarajevo in 1912), as well as the detailed analysis of first phase of Serbian Revolution (Ustanak na dahije 1804). In 1907, equally important was the analysis of the struggle between ‚Äúsupreme and central government‚Äù in insurgent Serbia: The Constitutional Question and the Law under Karageorge (Ustavno pitanje i zakon Karadjordjeva vremena). Apart from scholarly work, Novakoviƒá published political analysis mostly under the pseudonym \\"≈†arplaninac\\". These studies on contemporary politics, ethnographic questions, religious strife and national propaganda of various Balkan states, were published as a collection of papers under the title Balkan Questions (Balkanska pitanja) in 1906. In addition to political works, Novakoviƒá published several travelogues, on Constantinople (Pod zidinama Carigrada), Bursa (Brusa) and Turkey-in-Europe (S Morave na Vardar). Political career Novakoviƒá (the first man sitting on the left) representing Serbia at London Conference of 1912‚Äì13 Novakoviƒá became the Minister of Education and Religious Affairs in Jovan Ristiƒá‚Äôs Liberal cabinet in April 1873 and started to prepare the Law on high schools in Serbia. In October 1873 he became anew the Librarian, and in November 1874 again the Minister of Education in the Cabinet of Aƒáim ƒåumiƒá and in 1875 was offered the same ministerial post at the government of Prime Minister Danilo Stefanoviƒá. He became a professor at the Belgrade's Grandes √©coles in 1875, while from 1880 to 1883 he was, for the third time, the minister of education in the Milan Piroƒáanac conservative Progressive government, when he managed to regulate the status and legal position of both primary and secondary schools. Stojan Novakoviƒá, a kind of Serbian Jules Ferry, introduced compulsory primary education for Serbian children, and prepared and made passed dozens of important, often French-inspired bills into laws in the National Assembly. Being an early member of the group of Western-oriented intellectuals that formed the Progressive Party (Napredna stranka) in 1880, soon to be a pillar of King Milan Obrenoviƒá's Austrophile and Turkophile policy, Novakoviƒá was, as other Progressives led by Milan Piroƒáanac and Milutin Gara≈°anin, in favour of enlightened Western-inspired reforms that were to be introduced to the predominantly peasant society of Serbia. In 1883, Novakoviƒá became a member of the State Council (Dr≈æavni Savet), only to be reassigned shortly as Minister of Interior 1884 in Milutin Gara≈°anin's government. He soon stepped down after judging that Gara≈°anin was making too many concessions to King Milan Obrenoviƒá, before eventually returning to a more stable State Council. Novakoviƒá eventually entered into Serbian diplomacy in 1885. He was sent as the Serbian envoy to Constantinople, considered, along with Vienna and St. Petersburg, as one of the most important posts in that period. The diplomatic convention with Ottoman Turkey signed in 1886, due to Novakoviƒá's skillful negotiations, made possible the opening of Serbian consulates in Skopje, and Thessaloniki. Novakoviƒá stayed as Serbian envoy to Constantinople for almost seven years, until 1892. He was instrumental in organizing a huge network of Serbian consulates, secular and religious Serbian schools and Serb religious institutions throughout Turkey-in-Europe, in particular in Kosovo, Metohija and Macedonia between Skopje and Monastir (Bitolj, Bitola). Furthermore, Novakoviƒá initiated the establishment of closer Serbian-Greek cooperation, both with the government in Athens and the Patriarchate of Constantinople. As President of State Council, 1892‚Äì1895, Novakoviƒá was a member of a foreign policy committee that was instrumental to the flourishing of Serbian schools in the Ottoman Empire, as well as to the restoration of the vacant bishopric seat in Prizren in Old Serbia (the Vilayet of Kosovo) to a Serbian Metropolitan. As the Prime Minister under King Aleksandar Obrenoviƒá (1895‚Äì1896), Novakoviƒá managed to convert the state debt, and avoid the financial collapse of Serbia. In order to obtain efficient protection of persecuted Christian Serbs in Ottoman Turkey, Novakoviƒá sided with Russia, laying the ground for further political gains in that area. After resigning from the government, Novakoviƒá, in October 1897, retired from leadership in the Progressive Party. Appointed anew as Serbian envoy to Constantinople (1897‚Äì1900), Novakoviƒá organized the first diplomatic action in order to protect Christian Serbs in the vilayet of Kosovo (Old Serbia), that were being persecuted by Muslim Albanian outlaws. Lacking Russian support, this action, additionally suppressed by Austria-Hungary, did not bring tangible results but raised awareness of both the Serbian and European public of the difficult conditions of the Serbs living under Turkish rule. The correspondence of Novakoviƒá with the Ottoman Foreign Minister was published in a bilingual French-Serbian ‚Äúblue book‚Äù, Documents diplomatiques. Correspondance concernant les actes de violence et de brigandage des Albanais dans la Vieille Serbie (Vilayet de Kosovo) 1989-1889 (Minist√®re des Affaires Etrang√®res, Belgrade 1899). After a brief appointment to Paris in 1900, Novakoviƒá was reassigned to St. Petersburg, where he remained to be the envoy of Kingdom of Serbia until 1904. Bust of Novakoviƒá in his hometown ≈†abac He retired in 1905. Nevertheless, as the most senior of Serbian statesmen, Novakoviƒá was appointed Prime Minister of the all-party government (1908‚Äì1909) during the Bosnian crisis provoked by the annexation of Bosnia & Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary, considered both as a violation of the Treaty of Berlin of 1878 and of legitimate Serbian interests. Novakoviƒá got no tangible results in his mission to Constantinople in order to persuade the Young Turk government to oppose the annexation of Bosnia. After being abandoned by both Russia and France in the annexation crisis, Serbia was obliged to formally accept the fait accompli imposed by Vienna in March 1909. His last, highly successful diplomatic mission as the first delegate was as the head of the Serbian delegation at the Conference of Ambassadors in London summoned after the Balkan Wars (1912‚Äì1913). During difficult deliberations in London, the efforts and expertise offered by Novakoviƒá proved vital in providing significant territorial gains for Serbia in Old Serbia and Macedonia at the expense of Ottoman Turkey. After retirement in 1905, Novakoviƒá published a memoir in 1912 regarding the political situation in Serbia from 1883 to 1903, covering two decades of rule of the two last Obrenoviƒá rulers, various issues regarding the Constitution (he was in favor of two chamber system), and the role of the King and the level of democracy in the then-highly politically divided society of Serbia (Dvadeset godina ustavne politike u Srbiji : 1883-1903 : istorijsko- memoarske zapiske k tome vremenu i k postanju i praktikovanju Ustava od 1888 i 1901). More of a cabinet scholar than a political leader, Novakoviƒá remained famous for his vast knowledge on various sources, strict methodological approach, dispassionate analysis and patriotic interest in discovering unknown historical data on Serbian history. Personal life Novakoviƒá was born as Kosta Novakoviƒá but changed his first name to Stojan. One of his close friends and correspondents was sociology pioneer and jurist Valtazar Bogi≈°iƒá. He was married to Jelena Kujund≈æiƒá, sister of Milan Kujund≈æiƒá Aberdar. Legacy He is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs list. Novakoviƒá received a number of orders and decoration both in Serbia and abroad. Historian Radovan Samard≈æiƒá called hym \\"a great polyhistor\\" and noticed Novakoviƒá's importance on the development of Serbian historiography and his influence on the work of dr Vladimir ƒÜoroviƒá. Selected works Novakoviƒá authored more than 400 works and 50 books. *Srpska biblijografija za noviju knji≈æevnost, 1741-1867, U Biogradu : Srpsko uƒçeno dru≈°tvo, 1869, XXIV+644 pp. *Istorija srpske knji≈æevnosti : pregled ugaƒëan za ≈°kolsku potrebu : s jednim litografisanim snimkom, Drugo sasvim preraƒëeno izdanje, Beograd : izdanje i ≈°tampa Dr≈æavne ≈°tamparije, 1871, XII+332 pp. *Kosovo : srpske narodne pjesme o boju na Kosovu : poku≈°aj da se sastave u cjelinu kao spjev, U Biogradu : u Dr≈æavnoj ≈°tampariji, 1871, 40 pp. *Primeri knji≈æevnosti i jezika staroga i srpsko- slovenskoga, Beograd, Izdanje i ≈°tampa Dr≈æavne ≈°tamparije, 1877, XXVII+593 pp. *Zemlji≈°te radnje Nemanjine, U Beogradu : u Dr≈æavnoj ≈°tampariji, 1877, 83 pp. *Die serbischen Volkslieder √ºber die Kosovo-Schlacht (1389): Eine kritische Studie 1879, pp. 413‚Äì462 *Heraldiƒçki obiƒçaji u Srba : u primeni i Knji≈æevnosti, Beograd, Kraljevsko-srpska dr≈æavna ≈°tamparija, 1884, 140 pp. *Bele≈°ke o ƒê.

He is remembered for his friendships with the composers Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven, and for the biography he wrote of Haydn. Early life and career He was born in Stuttgart on 8 January 1769. His father was Georg Christoph Griesinger (1734/5 - 1782), who was a lawyer and civil servant.Clive (2001, 139-140) He grew up in Stuttgart and attended university, studying theology, in T√ºbingen.Clive (2001, 139-140) He later worked as a tutor in an aristocratic home in Morges, Switzerland.Clive (2001, 139-140) In 1799, he moved to Vienna, in order to work as the tutor of the son of Count Johann Hilmar Adolph Sch√∂nfeld, the ambassador of Saxony to Austria.Clive (2001, 139-140) He remained in Vienna for the rest of his life, but changed careers there in 1804, becoming a diplomat at the Saxon embassy. He first held the rank of secretary, then counsellor and finally (1831) charg√© d'affaires.Clive (2001, 139-140) Relations with Haydn In Saxony Griesinger had become acquainted with Gottfried H√§rtel, head of the Leipzig publishing firm of Breitkopf & H√§rtel. When he moved to Vienna, the firm asked him to help negotiate a publishing agreement with Joseph Haydn. These negotiations were fully successful, and resulted in Breitkopf & H√§rtel producing a \\"complete works\\" edition of Haydn's compositions.Given Haydn's vast output, this edition was hardly complete, but its scope was far greater than anything before it in the publication of Haydn's work. Griesinger became Haydn's friend, and often visited him after his efforts were no longer needed for business reasons. =Haydn biography= Griesinger eventually conceived the idea of writing a biography of Haydn, and when he came home from his visits to the composer, he wrote down the words he remembered, in hopes of increasing the accuracy of his work. The book appeared first as a sequence of eight installments in the Breitkopf & H√§rtel journal Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, then, after revisions, as an independent work in 1810 (Biographische Notizen √ºber Joseph Haydn, Leipzig).Biographische Notizen √ºber Joseph Haydn. Breitkopf & H√§rtel, Leipzig 1810 (). Particularly in comparison to work of other Haydn biographers of the same time (e.g. Giuseppe Carpani and Albert Christoph Dies), Griesinger's stands out for its careful writing, thoughtfulness, care with facts, and reluctance to embellish. Haydn scholar Vernon Gotwals considered it a clear first choice among the early biographies for obtaining facts about Haydn's life.Gotwals 1959 The letters that Griesinger sent to Breitkopf & H√§rtel also serve as a valuable source for the lives of both Haydn and Beethoven. Relations with Beethoven In 1802 the Breitkopf & H√§rtel firm asked Griesinger to negotiate for them with the newly-prominent composer Ludwig van Beethoven. As with the earlier Haydn negotiations, these were successful and led to a long-term friendship between Griesinger and Beethoven. The relationship between Beethoven and Breitkopf & H√§rtel began not at all smoothly. Beethoven offered the firm his String Quintet in C, published by Breitkopf & H√§rtel in 1802 as Opus 29. However, to Breitkopf & H√§rtel's surprise, the rival publishing firm of Artaria also issued an edition of this work, which would have reduced Breitkopf & H√§rtel's profits from it. Gottfried H√§rtel initially felt that Beethoven was responsible for this, and there was acrimonious correspondence between the two. Beethoven's brother Kaspar urged the company to bring in Griesinger onto the case, knowing that Beethoven liked and trusted him. On intervening, Griesinger wrote to the firm, insisting that Beethoven \\"is a man devoid of duplicity and deceit.\\"In fact, there is scholarly disagreement concerning whether Beethoven really did act honorably in this case. Clive (2001) sides with Beethoven, describing the Artaria edition as \\"pirated\\". MacArdle (1948) describes a rather more complicated picture, suggesting complicity (or at least cooperation) by Beethoven and in general depicting the composer in a considerably worse light than Clive does. The dispute was resolved. Beethoven later published with the firm again, and during the years 1809-1812 they were his primary publishers, with Griesinger again serving as intermediary.Source for this paragraph except as noted: Clive (2001, 139-140) Beethoven at one point read Griesinger's biography of Haydn, and he admired it. A note he wrote to Griesinger in 1822 expressing his appreciation is preserved.The web site of the Beethoven-Haus in Bonn includes an image of the note and some discussion; In 1823, Griesinger helped Beethoven find aristocratic patronage for the Missa Solemnis.Clive (2001, 139-140) Death Griesinger died in Vienna on 9 April 1845.

It is thought to play an immune role in the junctional epithelium at the gingival crevice in the human mouth. It is very similar in structure to statherin, a protein contained in saliva. Structure and genetics FDC-SP is a 68-amino acid protein containing a signal peptide at its N terminus, which is used for directing the transport of the protein. Adjacent to the signal peptide, the protein contains a highly charged N-terminal sequence. The C-terminal half of FDC-SP is proline-rich and not highly conserved between species, but the alignment of proline residues within this region is highly conserved. FDC-SP homologues are only easily located within the human, rat, mouse and chimpanzee genome. There is a 70% sequence homology between mouse and rat and a 45% homology between human and mouse. The N-terminal, however, is highly conserved between all three species and is thought to contain potential casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation sites. CK2 is a constitutively and widely expressed serine/threonine kinase that has many substrates related to signal transduction and cell growth regulation. Several casein genes have also been found nearby to the FDC-SP gene. Numerous genes that are expressed in oral tissues, including statherin, mucin, ameloblastin, histatin, enamelin and proline-rich protein are also located in close proximity to the FDC-SP gene. This indicates that the aforementioned genes may be expressed through the same mechanism. The recent evolutionary development of FDC-SP correlates with the development of certain aspects of the mammalian immune system and with the emergence of the follicular germinal centre (GC) reaction in secondary lymphoid tissues. Chromosome 4 Expression In humans, FDC-SP was first found within follicular dendritic cell isolates from the tonsil, and later was found to be specifically expressed within the periodontal ligament. FDC-SP expression can be induced in human FDC-like cell lines by exposure to tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Exposure of human peripheral blood cells to LPS can also result in FDC- SP expression, but TNF exposure does not cause FDC-SP expression and similarly LPS exposure does not cause expression within FDC-like cell lines. Expression in mouse splenocytes can be induced by LPS in a similar manner to that of human peripheral blood cells. In mice, as in humans, FDC-SP is not expressed in B cells, but FDC-SP expression in FDCs can be dependent on B cells after their stimulation by CD40. After stimulation with CD40, B cells have been shown to be able to induce phenotypic changes in FDCs through the B cell's surface TNF expression. It has therefore been suggested that the expression of TNF cytokines by B cells causes FDC-SP expression within FDCs upon contact. This reaction is said to be typical during GC formation. FDC-SP is highly expressed in the junctional epithelium and well as in the tonsils, prostate, lymph nodes and trachea. The proline rich region in the C-terminal half bears some resemblance to the antimicrobial peptide Bac5. FDC-SP may therefore have a role in microbial defense in the oral cavity. Function In transgenic mice engineered to constitutively express FDC-SP, the number and size of GCs formed after immunization with a T-dependent antigen significantly decreased. The position of these GCs is normal, but they do not form centres of highly- proliferating B cells, which us thought be due to FDC-SP affecting the development of GCs. The mechanism by which FDC-SP exerts its effects upon GC development is not currently known. The formation of FDC networks appears to be normal in transgenic mice, as does T cell response. FDC-SP is an amphipathic molecule, similar to surfactant proteins A and D, which are thought to be involved in the innate immune system of the lung. These proteins allow for the phagocytosis of bacteria by binding to them. Stathrin has been proposed to have similar properties, which itself possesses similar properties to FDC-SP. Stathrin can bind oral bacteria, so it has been proposed that FDC- SP acts as part of a host defence mechanism against oral pathogens. FDC-SP is thought to bind target cells through a specific receptor in a similar manner to cytokines and chemokines. Although it shares no sequence homology with chemokines or cytokines, FDC-SP has several properties in common with several inflammatory mediators, including molecular mass and amino acid composition. The FDC-SP gene is also located next to a group of proline-rich salivary peptide genes, which themselves are next several to CXC chemokine genes. FDC- SP has an effect on B cell migration when used in conjunction with L cells, and migration is significantly increased when the B cells are stimulated with anti-CD40 plus IL-4. The addition of anti-CD40 causes the B cells to resemble those found in the GC. Pertussis toxin inhibits the action of G proteins and B cells treated with the toxin were observed to migrate poorly in response to FDC-SP. FDC-SP has been found to have an unusually high level of expression in a number of tumours, including breast carcinoma, epithelial ovarian carcinoma and endometrial carcinoma. It is hypothesised that FDC-SP can influence cell motility by specific receptor binding in a similar manner to chemokines. It is also thought that FDC-SP can regulate the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton, which may have an effect on cell motility.

Facts In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, since 2004, any individual arrested for any recordable offence has had a DNA sample taken and stored as a digital profile in the National DNA Database. Even if the individual was never charged, if criminal proceedings were discontinued, or if the person was later acquitted of any crime, their DNA profile could nevertheless be kept permanently on record. The majority of the Council of Europe member states allow the compulsory taking of fingerprints and DNA samples in the context of criminal proceedings; however the United Kingdom (specifically, England, Wales and Northern Ireland) was the only member state that expressly permitted the systematic and indefinite retention of such DNA profiles. In contrast, DNA samples taken in Scotland when individuals are arrested must be destroyed if the individual is not charged or convicted. The case involved two claimants from Sheffield, England: Mr. S. and Michael Marper. Mr S. was arrested on 19 January 2001 at the age of eleven and charged with attempted robbery. His fingerprints and DNA samples were taken. He was acquitted on 14 June 2001. Michael Marper was arrested on 13 March 2001 and charged with harassment of his partner. His fingerprints and DNA samples were taken. The charge was not pressed because Marper and his partner became reconciled before a pretrial review had taken place. =Procedural history= The decision of the European Court of Human Rights overturned judgments favourable to the government from the United Kingdom's House of Lords, Court of Appeal and High Court. Both claimants had asked the Police Chief Constable for the samples of their DNA that had been taken to be destroyed. The Administrative Division of the High Court refused an application for judicial review in 2002 of the decision not to destroy the fingerprints and samples, and this decision was in turn upheld by the Court of Appeal in 2003. That judgment noted that the Police Chief Constable did retain the power to destroy samples in the rare instance in which he was completely satisfied that the individual was free from all suspicion whatsoever, and when the retention of samples had enabled information to be used for the legitimate purpose of combating crime. On appeal to the House of Lords in 2004, Lord Steyn also observed the considerable value of retained fingerprints and samples, and commented on the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, in that it had been enacted to replace the previous law which had provided that DNA samples could be destroyed following the acquittal of an accused. However, in Baroness Hale‚Äôs observation, later mentioned by the European Court of Human Rights judgment, retention of both fingerprint and DNA data constituted an interference by the State with a person's right to respect for his private life which attracted the protection of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and therefore required justification by the state. =Submissions= When the matter was before the European Court of Human Rights' Grand Chamber, the non-governmental organizations Liberty and Privacy International were granted permission to file third-party submissions and submitted scientific evidence on the private nature of genetic material and information contained in DNA samples. Liberty stressed that general principles of European human rights law dictated that interference by a member state with an individual's rights under the Convention must be ‚Äúnecessary in a democratic society‚Äù and have a legitimate aim to answer a ‚Äúpressing social need\\"; even then an identified interference must be proportionate and remains subject to review by the Court (Coster v United Kingdom (2001) 33 EHRR 479)). The applicants stressed that the nature of DNA samples, which included a myriad highly personal data pertaining to an individual's unique identity, susceptibility to certain medical conditions and was linked to genetic information of their relatives, meant that not only the taking of the data, but its storage, retention and constant automatic corroboration against other samples taken from current criminal investigations, caused them to suffer unwanted stigma and adverse psychological consequences. This was especially so in the case of S, as he was a child at the time of having his samples taken and relied on Article 40 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989, which states that it is the right of every child alleged to have infringed a penal law to be treated in a manner consistent with the promotion of the child's dignity and worth, reinforcing the respect for the child's human rights and fundamental freedoms. In response, the United Kingdom submitted that the use of the DNA samples was permitted under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and did not fall under the scope of Article 8 of the Convention. According to the United Kingdom's government, retention of the data did not impair the physical or psychological integrity of a person, restrict personal development, inhibit ability to establish personal relationships, or the right of self-determination. The DNA profile was merely a sequence of numbers which provided a means of identifying a person against bodily tissue and was not materially intrusive; the retention of data was a legitimate aim because it assisted in the identification of future offenders. Judgment In a unanimous verdict, the seventeen-judge bench held that there had been a violation of Article 8 and awarded ‚Ç¨42,000 to each of the applicants. The Court did therefore not go on to consider whether the retention of DNA was also a breach of Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination) as the applicants had also argued that they had suffered detrimental treatment on the basis of an acquired status. Notably, another part of the United Kingdom, namely Scotland, had provided an example of a proportionate, more rational approach in regard to DNA retention, in that samples were to be destroyed if an individual was not convicted or was granted an absolute discharge; an exemption however exists for the authorities to retain samples if the individual is suspected of certain sexual or violent offences (Retention Guidelines for Nominal Records on the Police National Computer 2006). Through this ruling, the European Court of Human Rights has further developed its body of jurisprudence on what measures are likely to fall outside a state's margin of appreciation. The Court determined that where there is no consensus between member states as to how important a matter at stake is, the margin ought to be wider, however as the facts in this instance involved the interference with intimate details of utmost importance to the individual, the margin allowed to the state was narrow and the United Kingdom had not struck the right balance. Significance In May 2009, nearly 6 months after the court decision, the Home Office announced a consultation on how to comply with the ruling. The government proposed to continue retaining indefinitely the DNA profiles of anyone convicted of any recordable offence, but to remove other profiles from the database after a number of years. The practice of taking DNA profiles upon arrest is not affected by the decision ‚Äì for adults arrested but not actually convicted of any crime, it is proposed that their profiles will deleted from the database after 6 years, except for those whose arrest was in connection with a serious violent or sexual crime; their profiles will be stored for 12 years before deletion. Young people arrested but not convicted will have their profiles removed when they turn 18 years of age, as will youths convicted of some less serious offences. As of January 2011, this consultation remains unimplemented. The Northern Irish High Court has ruled that the regulations Marper declared breached article 8 should be followed despite the Marper decision. They said it was up to the government to change the law. This decision has been criticised, particularly since it was open to the court to declare the blanket DNA retention policy incompatible with the European Convention of Human Rights.http://www.lawthink.co.uk/2011/01/dna-samples-fingerprints-courts-not- giving-effect-to-hra/ In February 2011 the government announced the Protection of Freedoms Bill to limit the scope of the DNA database and comply with the Marper ruling. Under the new scheme the DNA profiles of those arrested or charged with a minor offence would be destroyed if they are not convicted. The vast majority of the one million people on the DNA database who have been arrested but not convicted of a crime would be removed from it within months of the bill becoming law. On 18 May 2011 the UK Supreme Court ruled that the ACPO guidelines allowing indefinite retention of DNA profiles were unlawful, in line with the ECHR ruling. However given that Parliament was already legislating on the issue they decided that no further action should be taken. According to The Independent on 27 July 2011, the UK government \\"has indicated that destroying the DNA of the innocent would be impossible because the records are mixed up in batches alongside the DNA of the guilty.\\" The \\"Home Office minister James Brokenshire has revealed that these profiles will be retained by forensic science laboratories.

The Measure modified the eligibility requirements for Oregon residents to participate in the Oregon Prescription Drug Program. The program intends to make prescription drugs available to participants at the lowest possible cost through negotiated price discounts. It was passed overwhelmingly by voters, garnering 78% of the vote. Background Oregon law authorizes the Oregon Prescription Drug Program, which is intended to reduce prescription drug costs and to make prescription drugs available to participants at the lowest possible cost. At the time the measure was passed, existing law authorized the program's administrator to negotiate price discounts, to purchase prescription drugs on behalf of participants, and to reimburse pharmacies. At the time, only Oregon residents over age 54 whose gross annual income did not exceed 185% of federal poverty guidelines and who had not had private prescription drug benefit coverage for the past 6 months were eligible to participate in the Program. Measure 44 eliminated those restrictions and expands Program eligibility to all Oregon residents who have no prescription drug coverage except Medicare Part D. Description of the Measure Ballot Measure 44 modified the eligibility requirements then in effect for Oregon residents to participate in the Oregon Prescription Drug Program. The program intends to make prescription drugs available to participants at the lowest possible cost through negotiated price discounts. The current program at the time limited to Oregon residents who were: a) at least 54 years old; b) earned less than 185% of the federal poverty level (then $18,130 per individual); and c) have not had private prescription drug coverage for the six months preceding application to the program. Ballot Measure 44 expanded the Oregon Prescription Drug Program by removing those eligibility requirements so that all Oregonians without prescription drug coverage regardless of age or income may participate. Participation in the Oregon Prescription Drug Program is voluntary. Medicare Part D prescription plan enrollees would be eligible to join. Participants receive a card to use at participating pharmacies to purchase prescription drugs at the discounted price. The measure did not call for any state funding for implementation of the measure. Election results During the November 7, 2006 general election and Measure 48 was approved by a large margin, garnering 1,049,594 out 1,346,243 (78%) votes on this ballot line. There was no organized opposition to the measure, and no arguments in opposition were filed for inclusion in the voters' pamphlet.

In 1972, while on foreign study in Tokyo, he was introduced to the Kinko Style shakuhachi master (later designated \\"Living National Treasure\\") Goro Yamaguchi, whom he studied with until Yamaguchi‚Äôs death in 1999. In 1975, Blasdel began learning Aikido under Yasuo Kobayashi and performing with the butoh dancer Akira Kasai at his studio, Tenshikan. Blasdel presently holds a 4th degree black belt in Aikido. In 1978, Blasdel entered the Musicology Faculty at Tokyo National University of Fine Arts (Geidai) with a scholarship from the Japanese government. He studied traditional Japanese and Asian music under the pioneering ethnomusicologist Fumio Koizumi and the Noh scholar Mario Yokomichi. He studied the ancient My√¥an Style shakuhachi from Chikugai Okamoto and ensemble techniques from shamisen/koto master and Living National Treasure Kunie Fujii and gagaku ry√ªteki flute under Sukeyasu Shiba. Blasdel graduated from Geidai with an MFA in 1982. In 1984, he received his shihan master teaching license and professional name, Yohmei, from Yamaguchi‚Äîthe first of only two non-Japanese ever accredited by Yamaguchi.

Two men, Vladyslav Volkovich (–í–ª–∞–¥–∏—Å–ª–∞–≤ –í–æ–ª–∫–æ–≤–∏—á) and Volodymyr Kondratenko (–í–æ–ª–æ–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ö–æ–Ω–¥—Ä–∞—Ç–µ–Ω–∫–æ) were arrested and charged with 16 murders. Most victims were shot with a .22 sporting rifle and stabbed or bludgeoned with a wide variety of weapons ranging from stitching awls to bricks and iron bars. The killers claimed that they began the murder spree in order to prepare themselves for an eventual career as contract killers, practicing on the homeless, and continued killing for profit and for fun. Kondratenko committed suicide in prison during the trial. Volkovich was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. Murders On June 18, 1996, a 44-year-old factory worker named Yevheniy Osechkin was found dead near the Karavaevi Dachi railway station in Kiev. An anonymous tipster called the police and claimed that someone was just shot with a silenced pistol. However forensics uncovered that the victim was actually shot with a .22 round (a single shell casing was recovered), and stabbed multiple times. The tipster was never located. Investigation quickly determined that Osechkin, a factory worker, had no enemies, and robbery was ruled out as a motive as Osechkin still had the salary he received the day of the murder on his person. Investigators then began looking at other murders in the area, and found that some months earlier a homeless man had been shot with a .22 rifle and stabbed in the same area, just 100 meters away from the spot where Osechkin was murdered. Investigators began canvassing the area, and set up surveillance at the train station. Some people that raised the suspicion of the investigators were arrested, but all had alibis for the time of the murders. Two weeks later a well-known local doctor named Oleksandr Yehorov was shot and killed in his car in broad daylight. Some witnesses to the murder were located, who provided a description of a suspect described as a lone man of about 30 years of age. Less than an hour after Yehorov's murder, another male victim was found several blocks away, again shot with a .22 rifle and stabbed. Description of a man seen loitering in the area matched the suspect in the Yehorov and the Osechkin murders. Fingerprints were also recovered from both scenes. However, no match was found for the fingerprints in any databases, and the description offered few leads. The investigation stalled until another murder was reported two weeks later. The new victim was a man named Oleksandr Shpack. Prior to the murder he was at a birthday party with his girlfriend. After getting drunk, Shpack got into an argument with two men who crashed the party. All four then left the party. Shpack was found shot and stabbed a short time later. Shpack's girlfriend provided a description of the two men, which matched the earlier murders. She also remembered that one of the men was named Volodymyr. =More victims= On September 4, another male victim was found in the streets, shot in the head and the chest with a .22 rifle and stabbed. Shell casings found at the scene tied it with the earlier murders. However, the victim was never identified and no witnesses came forward. The investigation stalled again. On September 28 at about 10:30 PM, another male victim aged 35 to 40, this time a man named Petr Gromov, was found shot in his vehicle, a VAZ-2106. After being shot twice in the head, Gromov was stabbed multiple times. The killers pushed the body out of the car and tried to drive away, but the shots broke a window and punctured the roof, and the killers abandoned the vehicle less than a block away, apparently concerned that the damage would draw unwanted attention. Investigators were now convinced that they were dealing with a pair of serial killers who targeted men in mid-to-late 30s. Local militsia (police) was instructed to arrest anyone matching the description on sight. Canvassing apartments near the Hromov murder scene, they located a woman who claimed to recognize one of the suspects as a man named Volodymyr who lived nearby. Police put the building she pointed out under surveillance. Surveillance located an unlocked door in the building, and there was a dead body inside the apartment, also shot and stabbed. The victim was identified as Oleksandr Bykov. His death was estimated to have occurred on September 23. Several unlit matches had been stuck between the door and the frame, which fell out when the door was opened. Investigators surmised that these were markers left by the killers to determine whether the door had been opened in case they ever returned. The apartment was put under constant surveillance, and a man matching the description was seen to approach the building three days later. Unfortunately something spooked him, and the investigators lost the man when he ran into a nearby marketplace. =Capture= By this time, five more murders had been tied to the .22 killings, with a total of 11 known victims. Investigators suspected that there had been some others. Desperate for leads, the investigators pored over older reports. Crime scene photographs from the Bykov crime scene contained the images of a person matching a suspect's description. The man volunteered to assist the police in search for clues and gave them his name. He was identified as Volodymyr Dmytrovych Kondratenko. However, the investigators did not have his address. Continued surveillance on a Sotzialistychna Street block where the Bykov and Gromov murders took place quickly located Kondratenko loitering with another man who also matched a suspect's description. The second man was later identified as Vladyslav Volkovych. By the time the information was sent up the chain and the two men were ordered detained, the pair claimed one final victim, an unidentified woman they struck and killed while driving drunk at a high rate of speed in a stolen VAZ-2102. The car was stolen in preparation for a burglary of a commercial warehouse, where they also planned to murder the lone guard. Once detained, the men quickly confessed to over 20 murders, as well as numerous robberies, carjackings, and burglaries. =Findings= The reasons behind Kondratenko's assistance in the Bykov investigation were quickly uncovered. Apparently Kondratenko had been friends with Bykov for years, and also had an affair with Bykov's wife. Bykov also reportedly owned a pistol that Kondratenko wanted for himself. After the murder he continued to see the victim's wife, and drove her to the morgue and appointments with investigators, ostensibly helping her to look for her husband's killer, all in order to continue their affair. The killers' MO was also explained, shedding light on the reasons why most witnesses only saw one killer with most victims. By the time the men began killing drivers for their cars, Volkovich would hitch-hike, and ask the drivers to go to an address to pick up a \\"friend with a box\\". The waiting friend would be Kondratenko, and the box would contain their .22 TOZ-16 sporting rifle. Kondratenko would immediately shoot the driver, and Volkovich would stab him at the same time. They had apparently murdered at least 7 men for their cars, most of which they later sold. =Trial= The case quickly went to trial. Two more co-conspirators were identified. Andriy Tymoshyn, a former Senior Customs Inspector, was charged with one of the murders and the subsequent auto theft. Serhiy Tretiachenko, a delivery driver, was charged with assisting Kondratenko with attempted auto theft in a murder / burglary scheme that was cut short by the arrest. Two main suspects, Volkovich and Kondratenko, had confessed to over 20 murders, but many of their earlier victims who had been homeless were never located. The two men were charged with only 16 of the murders. Days after the trial began, Kondratenko overdosed on prescription medication and died while in police custody. His death was ruled a suicide. After his death, Volkovich attempted to change his testimony to paint Kondratenko as the only trigger man in all of the murders. Tymoshyn also changed his testimony, claiming that he was unaware that the other men planned to kill their victim, and simply went along to rob a taxi driver. Kondratenko had earlier stated that Tymoshyn had offered them a price to kill that particular victim, who was apparently in conflict with the inspector. After a lengthy trial, all three living suspects were found guilty in August 2000. Volkovich received the sentence of life imprisonment, as the death penalty had been abolished in Ukraine. Suspects According to a psychological profile prepared by the prosecution, Kondratenko had been a model child until he started school, when a constant physical abuse by his father began to take its toll. Kondratenko was initially a good student, but his perfectionist father would severely beat him for any grade below a 5 or Excellent. Kondratenko's personality quickly changed; first he'd get on his knees and beg his teachers not to give him lower grades, but quickly stopped and became shy and withdrawn. After graduation Kondratenko's father, a construction worker, forced his son to go into an architectural college. Kondratenko dropped out after one semester, and at the age of 18 was drafted into the Soviet Army. Army service was reportedly hard on Kondratenko, who was frequently injured, once receiving a serious concussion after falling from a tank. He was also constantly abused in the atmosphere of rampant hazing (dedovshchina). He was discharged after the compulsory service, and reported back home in civilian clothes, instantly inviting a beating from his father for not being in uniform. Kondratenko planned to go back to school, but came down with a severe case of jaundice which left permanent disfiguring marks on his face. Kondratenko was so unhappy with his appearance that he refused to go outside for months. He was eventually committed to a psychiatric institution by his parents, but after some time was deemed sane and released. Unable to find a job, and continuing to stay at home most of the time, the conflict between Kondratenko and his father continued to grow. Kondratenko knew that he needed to move out, and in order to move out, he needed money. Vladyslav Volkovich, according to prosecution, had \\"an even less interesting background than Kondratenko\\". He was reportedly a twin, growing up in an uneventful household with no reported instances of abuse or aggression. Growing up in poverty, Volkovich was always preoccupied with appearances and looking for ways to make money, but did not want a full-time job. He made friends with Kondratenko and the two men often discussed various ways of making money, as well as various philosophical concepts, eventually deciding that \\"there is no such thing as morals or honor in this world\\". Motivation The two men discussed becoming contract killers, thinking that this would be a perfect job for them. They also discussed killing some of their friends for more immediate financial gain. However they did not know how to look for contract work, and were unsure they'd be able to kill a friend on the first try, so they decided to practice on the homeless. They reportedly killed at least five before risking to attack a more dangerous target. They eventually settled on attacking car owners; owning a personal vehicle was a considerable luxury and a sign of wealth in the former Soviet Union of the early 1990s. However the killers admitted that they did not have much luck killing random car owners, as most of them had little if any money on them, and taking and later selling their cars was difficult. By this time however both men admitted that they enjoyed the act of killing by itself, and continued to kill even if it didn't bring financial gain. Speaking of their victims at trial, Volkovich stated that \\"they were nothing to me, not people, just items in a list\\". He then added that murders became like a drug to him. \\"They made me feel like a superman\\", he said. The only victim he expressed any regret over was their last, the woman he had accidentally hit while drunk driving, and the pair's only known female victim.

The PSO-1 was, at the time of its introduction on 3 July 1963 together with the Dragunov sniper rifle, the most technically advanced telescopic sight ever designed for a mass-production designated marksman or sniper rifle.  Design  The PSO-1 was specifically designed for the SVD as a telescopic sight for military designated marksman activities. The current version of the sight is the PSO-1M2. This telescopic sight is different from the original PSO-1 only in that it lacks the now obsolete infrared detector, which was used to detect generation-zero active-infrared night vision devices like the US M2 Sniperscope. The metal body of the PSO-1 is made from a magnesium alloy. The PSO-1 features a battery-powered red illuminated reticle with light provided by a simple diode bulb. It features professionally ground, fully multi-coated optical elements, a baked enamel finish for scratch protection, and an attached, quick-deployable, extendable sunshade. The scope body is sealed and filled with nitrogen, which prevents fogging of optics and was designed to function within a -50 ¬∞C to 50 ¬∞C temperature range. For zeroing the telescopic sight the reticle can be adjusted by manipulating the elevation and windage turrets in at (0.5 mil or 1.72 MOA) increments.Russian PSO-1 sniper scope Considered the higher end of Soviet military side-mount telescopic sights, the quality of the PSO-1 is higher than most other PSO-style telescopic sights. The PSO-1 has neither a focus adjustment nor a parallax compensation control. Most modern military tactical scopes with lower power fixed magnification such as the ACOG, C79 optical sight or SUSAT (intended for rapid close-intermediate range shots rather than long-range sniping) lack such features as well. Modern fixed magnification military high-end-grade sniper telescopic sights scopes intended for long-range shooting usually offer one or both of these features. The positioning of the scope's body to the left of the bore's center line may not be comfortable to all shooters. =Bullet drop compensation elevation turret= The PSO-1 elevation turret features bullet drop compensation (BDC) in or increments for engaging point and area targets at ranges from up to . At longer distances the shooter must use the chevrons that would shift the trajectory by per each chevron. The BDC feature must be tuned at the factory for the particular ballistic trajectory of a particular combination of rifle and cartridge at a predefined air density. Inevitable BDC-induced errors will occur if the environmental and meteorological circumstances deviate from the circumstances the BDC was calibrated for. Marksmen can be trained to compensate for these errors.PSO-1 Manual Besides the BDC elevation (vertical adjustment control) of the reticle, the windage (horizontal adjustment control) of the reticle can also be easily dialed in by the user without having to remove turret caps. =Reticle= The PSO-1 pattern range-finding reticle. The bottom-left corner can be used to determine the distance from a 1.7 m tall target A 1.7 m tall person correctly ranged at The PSO-1 features a reticle with \\"floating\\" elements designed for use in range estimation and bullet drop and drift compensation (see external ballistics). The top center \\"chevron\\" (^) is used as the main aiming mark. The horizontal hash marks are for windage and lead corrections and can be used for ranging purposes as well. To the left is a stadiametric rangefinder that can be used to determine the distance from a tall object/person from (2) to (10). For this the lowest part of the target is lined up on the bottom horizontal line. Where the top of the target touches the top curved line the distance can be determined. This reticle layout is also used in several other telescopic sights produced and used by other former Warsaw Pact member states. The three lower chevrons in the center are used as hold over points for engaging area targets beyond (the maximum BDC range setting on the elevation drum). The user has to set the elevation turret to and then apply the chevrons for , or respectively.PSO-1 Manual, No. 8.3, P.3 The 10 reticle hashmarks in the horizontal plane can be used to compensate for wind or moving targets and can also be used for additional stadiametric rangefinding purposes, since they are spaced at 1 milliradian intervals, meaning if an object is 5 m wide it will appear 10 hashmarks wide at 500 m. The reticle can be illuminated by a small battery-powered lamp.  Mounting system  The telescopic sight propriety mount is adjustable for tension on the SVD rifle's side rail. This side rail is a type of dovetail rail known as the Warsaw Pact rail, which has cut-out portions to reduce weight and allow easier installation. The side rail mount is an offset mounting that positions the PSO-1 telescopic sight axis to the left side in relation to the receiver center axis. The mount has a castle nut that screws into the bottom of the locking lever. The spring-loaded portion of the clamp has to be pressed down to tighten or loosen the castle nut as needed. As a result, the soldier can quickly remove and attach optics and retain the scopes zero.PSO-1 Manual The telescopic sight is factory matched to the rifle by engraving the scope's serial number on to the butt stock of the SVD rifle. Commercial Russian Tigr rifles (based on the SVD military rifle) have the serial number of the rifle engraved in to the PSO-1M2 scope's side mount.  Accessories  The PSO-1 is issued with a lens hood that can be attached to the ocular to reduce/eliminate image quality impairing stray light and a carrying case to protect the sight during transport and storage.

Description The NERV system allows the bacteria cultures within the reactor to be controlled both by type and volume. Fresh bacteria are bred and cultured outside of the reactor; regular dosing ensures that a constant supply of fresh bacteria is always on hand, even during periods of low nutrient values or high toxicity. This ensures that cultures are not 'wiped out' and that immediate recovery of bio-remediation takes place. NERV is more compact than traditional technology and during times of low nutrient levels the bacteria enter the state of endogenous respiration, a situation where they eat their own biomass. This results in dramatically lower sludge production compared with traditional biological systems. This technology benefits from a much smaller footprint than traditional systems and the concept of breeding bacteria outside of the unit removes the reliance on self-generating bacteria within the system giving it the ability to absorb toxic shocks and extreme nutrient variations. Use A typical NERV installation would be a cooked meat production plant with regularly washed down ovens. The effluent from such a factory would be very high in FOG (fats, oils and grease) but would frequently contain cleaning fluids and biocides. The bacteria in a traditional treatment system would be killed by this kind of shock, rendering the systems useless. Some food plants alternate their wash downs to be acidic and basic to avoid build up of resistant organisms, a properly set-up NERV reactor can deal with this variation.

The Detroit Economic Club, headquartered at 211 West Fort Street in downtown Detroit, Michigan, was formed in 1934 as a platform for the discussion and debate of important business, government and social issues. It is known internationally as a top speaking forum for prominent business, academic, and government officials, who address members and their guests at the Club's 35-meeting season. With more than 3,500 members, the DEC is a forum for vital issues. The DEC claims to have hosted every sitting U.S. President since Richard Nixon and is ranked among the top speaking platforms in the world. The DEC is one of the most valued podiums for CEO's in the world and one of the top five executive speaking forums in America.Detroit Economic Club  History  The Detroit Economic Club was founded in 1934 by Allen Crow. The objective of the Club was and still is: to promote an interest in, and to enlighten its members on important governmental, economic and societal issues. The growth in the Club was rapid in the first year, with 275 men joining. Specifically \\"men\\" because women were not admitted until 1973. That was the year after Michigan ratified the Equal Rights Amendment. Within five years of the inception, the Club's membership had grown to 1,100 and post World War II the membership was approaching 2,000. The logo of the Club is an Aladdin's Lamp, which Crow selected it because it was the Greek symbol for enlightenment. That is what the Club is all about. Born out of the Depression, the Club tends to succeed, even when the economy is not. Founder, Allen Crow, had a big idea: \\"Maybe if you gathered a lot of smart people in one room, on a regular basis, they could figure the way out (The Great Depression).\\"  Operation  The main activity of the Club is usually is in the form of a breakfast or lunch/business meeting setting. The Club presents, on average, 35 meetings per year. Where the speaker(s) take the podium/stage and address whatever their topic is at that time. Speakers usually speak for about 20‚Äì30 minutes and there is reserved times for networking and questions. Traditionally, the club would meet on Mondays. The history goes back before commercial air travel and the meetings were scheduled by Allen Crow on Monday's so that the speakers could travel to Detroit by train over the weekend and this would conserve their weekly business time. Originally, annual dues were $5.00 and tickets were $1.50. Over the years the dues have naturally increased to keep pace with inflation and growth. Now the Club has five categories of memberships ranging from Young Leader dues at $75.00 to Gold Membership at $500.00. The Club's meeting place was and still are some of the same venues from the early stages of the Club such as: the Book Cadillac Hotel (now the Westin Book Cadillac), and later a number of the Club's meetings took place at Cobo Hall, and is still a principal location.  Speakers  How The Club obtain speakers, is often asked. In early days, they did pay, but this costly practice was eliminated. Now, the speakers come because they welcome the opportunity to address the Club's prestigious forum, and for the extensive outreach they know their message will receive. In addition to the newspaper coverage that the speakers receive, a number of radio stations use to broadcast the meetings and was carried to about 400,000 Metro-Detroit area homes. Now, there is still the newspaper and radio coverage, but by technology advancing the way that it has, the Club sometimes have a live-stream for viewers at home or members on the road. The Club has always pushed to obtain some of the region's most prominent and well spoken leaders around the globe. To be fair, The Club has hosted a meeting with every President of the United States since former President Nixon. The first woman speaker at the DEC was Catherine Curtis on November 1, 1937 and she spoke on \\"The Housewife as Capitalist.\\" The first Black speaker was Lester Granger, President of the National Urban League on January 19, 1948. In addition to those groundbreaking speakers, there has been a number of international level leaders as well to grace the Club with their wisdom and words of enlightenment such as: Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. Antoly Dobrynin, Bruno Kreisky when he was the Australian Chancellor, Ambassador of the Republic of Cuba to the U.S. Jose Ramon Cabanas Rodriguez, and countless others.  Presidents (DEC Presidents)  The President of the Club, historically was the chief operating officer as well as the president. Nowadays, those titles and tasks are handled by two separate individuals with the same goal in mind. Since the first President and Founder, Allen B. Crow, there has been nine other fantastic Leaders of this great Club. Lester Skene Bork, Walker Lee Cisler, (who was also one of the founding members of the National Academy of Engineering) Russel A. Swaney, Theodore H. Mecke, Jr., Wesley R. Johnson, (also served as President of Woodall Industries and Libbey Owens Ford Plastics before retiring and serving the DEC) Gerald E. Warren, William R. Halling, (served on the Board of Directors for: Compuware and KPMG, LLP and also the third longest presidential term for the Club) and Elizabeth \\"Beth\\" Chappell, who served the Club for 15 years, which is the second longest term after the Founder, Allen B. Crow. The current President and CEO of the Club is Steve Grigorian, who has served since 2017.  Young Leaders Program  The Young Leader Program has been growing steadily over the years since its launch in 2007. The Young Leader members are made up of over 1,200 young professionals in out of the Metro-Detroit area. All YL members are under the age of 40 years, which is the only requirement to join the Young Leaders program. Not only do are the YL members allowed to regular DEC meetings, but also have their very own Young Leader Series meetings of their own. In addition to hosting an annual Young Leader Conference. The Young Leader program is continuously growing with more young professionals who are invested into the economic and political future of the great City of Detroit.  Career Readiness Academy (CRA)  The Detroit Economic Club‚Äôs Career Readiness Academy is a 6-month program that brings high school and Young Leader (YLs) members together for monthly meetings that aim to teach skills that will help the students effectively navigate their high school journey to find greater success in the working world. The same team of YLs and students meet each month which not only provides the opportunity for more personalized attention but also forges important mentor-mentee relationships. The monthly sessions are broke up into 6 groups, specifically to educate these students on career exploration, economic realities, college, and a number of other amazing tools that they will need as they work their way into the career path of their liking. National Summit In June 2009, the DEC assembled some of America‚Äôs top business, government and academic leaders, among others, in debate and dialogue on four issues of vital importance to America‚Äôs future in a global economy - Technology, Energy, Environment, and Manufacturing. The goal of The National Summit was to bring attention to actions that would improve America‚Äôs ability to compete in the 21st century.

It was responded by the Communists' second counter-encirclement campaign at Honghu Soviet (), also called by the communists as the second counter- encirclement campaign at Honghu Revolutionary Base (), in which the local Chinese Red Army successfully defended their soviet republic in the Honghu region against the Nationalist attacks from 1 March 1931, to early June, 1931. Prelude After their defeat in the first encirclement campaign against the Honghu Soviet in early February 1931 and the subsequent forced withdraw to regroup, nationalist forces launched the second encirclement campaign against the communist base in Honghu on 1 March 1931. The nationalists believed that their poorly supplied communist enemy would not have sufficient time to recover from previous battles in the last encirclement campaign, and they must not wait too long to provide more times for their communist enemy. The nationalist commander-in-chief was the same one in the first encirclement campaign against the Honghu Soviet, the 10th Army commander Xu Yuanquan (ÂæêÊ∫êÊ≥â), whose 10th Army was not deployed directly in the campaign, but instead, deployed some distance away from the battlefield as strategic reserve. The brunt of the fighting was to be carried out mostly by troops of regional warlords who were nominally under the command of Chiang Kai-shek. The communists were not jubilant after their victory achieved in first encirclement campaign against the Honghu Soviet, because they were fully aware the nationalist withdraw was only temporary and it was only matter of time before the nationalists resume their assault on Honghu Soviet. To better prepare the defense of their homebase against the new wave of the imminent nationalist attacks which had already begun, communists restructured their organization in Honghu Soviet. In the early March 1931, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CCoCPC) sent Xi√† Xƒ´ (Â§èÊõ¶) to Honghu Soviet for restructuring. To better coordinate administrative activities, CPC Hunan‚ÄìWestern Hubei Bureau was formed, and to better coordinate political activities, CPC provisional Hunan‚ÄìWestern Hubei provincial committee was formed. To better coordinate military affairs, Revolutionary military committee was formed, and Xi√† Xƒ´ was named as the CPC party secretary of the Hunan‚ÄìWestern Hubei Bureau, and the chairman of the revolutionary military committee. Cui Mei (Â¥îÁé´) was named as the party secretary of the CPC provisional Hunan‚ÄìWestern Hubei provincial committee, and he was later succeed by Yang Guanghua (Êù®ÂÖâÂçé). This restructure of communist party apparatus was proven to be catastrophic later on, when Xi√† Xƒ´ carried out huge purges on local communist ranks, resulting in causing more damage than the military actions taken by their nationalist enemy. Order of battle Nationalists: *Newly Organized 11th Division *19th Division *44th Brigade of the 15th Division *2 Brigades (including the 142nd Brigade) of the 48th Division *Newly Organized 2nd Brigade *Newly Organized 3rd Brigade Communists: *9th Division (Brigade-sized) **Independent Regiment **26th Regiment *Hunan‚ÄìWestern Hubei Garrison Regiment *Mianyang Independent Regiment *Training Regiment *Independent battalions of guerrillas First stage On 1 March 1931, the nationalist Newly Organized 11th Division and a brigade of the nationalist 48th Division crossed the Yangtze River and attacked the communist base on the southern bank of the Yangtze River. The local communist force was unable to repel the numerically and technically superior nationalist force, and was forced to fall back, and nationalists took Lotus Pond (Ouchi, ËóïÊ±†), Stone Head (Shishou, Áü≥È¶ñ) as a result. Communists were fully aware that they were no match for the enemy and reasoned that if they were to concentrate their forces and face off the enemy, they would be annihilated. Instead, the communists decided to split their forces into two, operating on both banks of the Yangtze River, and once the nationalists were stretched out too thin, the communists would counterattack. The primary objectives of communists were to defend their base on the southern bank of the Yangtze River, and to reestablish their base in the northern bank of the Yangtze River when possible, and if the enemy was overstretched and provided the needed opportunity, the communist would establish new bases if possible. Under the command of Duan Dechang (ÊÆµÂæ∑Êòå), the communist Independent Regiment and CPC party apparatus crossed the Yangtze River, and began guerrilla warfare in the regions of Qianjiang (ÊΩúÊ±ü), Mianyang (Ê≤îÈò≥) and Jiangli (ÁõëÂà©), deep behind the nationalist line in the heart of the nationalist-controlled area. Under the command Zhou Yiqun (Âë®ÈÄ∏Áæ§), the communist force on the southern bank of the Yangtze River also began guerrilla warfare, and at the same time, a portion of the force penetrated deep into the regions around the Dongting Lake, while another portion of the force escorted the local populace to the Eastern Mountain (Dongshan, ‰∏úÂ±±) region. Second stage In early April, 1931, nationalist 142nd Brigade of the 48th Division, 44th Brigade of the 15th Division, Newly Organized 11th Division, and the 19th Division attacked toward Eastern Mountain region from Tiaoxuankou (Ë∞ÉÂº¶Âè£), Wanyu (‰∏áÂ∫æ), Huarong County, and Yueyang respectively. After two major clashes at regions of Rape-Turnip Temple (Sanweisi, ‰∏âËëëÂØ∫) and Pine Wood Bridge (Songbanqiao ÊùæÊùøÊ°•), the communist attempt to check the nationalist advance was crashed. Local communist regular army and the communist Huarong Guerrillas were forced to withdrew to the north of the Yangtze River by mid-April, and the nationalist force succeeded in taking the Eastern Mountain region. However, by this time, the nationalist force was overstretched, and was unable to eradicate the remaining communist guerrillas in the newly conquered region, and moreover, their rear was constantly harassed by the communists forces that had crossed the Yangtze River, and with the bulk of the force deployed away during the campaign, there was simply not enough troops to stay behind to guard the vast areas in the rear. Realizing the nationalists had overstretched themselves way beyond the threshold, the communists jumped on the opportunity to counterattack. While the crack troops of the nationalist force was penetrating deep into the enemy territory and taking more lands, their rear was guarded by the second rate troops most consisted of poorly trained conscripts who were drafted just shortly prior to the first encirclement campaign against the Honghu Soviet. Seizing the opportunity, communist force on the northern bank of the Yangtze River including the Independent Regiment attacked and took the town of Red River (Zhuhe Êú±Ê≤≥) for four time, annihilated the 2nd Regiment of the nationalist Newly Organized 2nd Brigade in the process, forcing the nationalist brigade to be out of the action for the rest of the campaign. The communist force operated on the northern bank of the Yangtze River also attacked the town of Fengkou (Â≥∞Âè£) twice, completely annihilated two battalions of the nationalist Newly Organized 3rd Brigade in the process. A regiment of the nationalist Newly Organized 3rd Brigade consisted of newly drafted conscripts could not handle the pressure and after suffering a defeat that did not produce too much casualties, the surviving conscripts in the regiment deserted en masse. The destruction of the two nationalist newly organized brigades caused the total collapse in the new nationalist positions on the north bank of the Yangtze river, losing nearly all of the territories newly taken from the communists during their earlier success, and the communists thus successfully reestablished their original base on the northern bank of the river. Third stage The complete recovery of the communists on the northern bank of the Yangtze River marked the beginning of the communist counteroffensive. In April 1931, the communist Independent Regiment was expanded to have a second regiment, the 26th Regiment, and the new formation was renamed as the 9th Division of the 3rd Army, even though the new unit is only a brigade-sized formation at the best, since it only had two regiments. Additional communist military units were also formed, including Hunan‚ÄìWestern Hubei Garrison Regiment, Mianyang Independent Regiment, Training Regiment and the Independent battalions of guerrillas of several counties in the communist base. After the reorganization, communists took the initiative by attacking the nationalists, and in the battle fought in the region of Laoxinkou (ËÄÅÊñ∞Âè£) in mid April, the previously badly mauled nationalist Newly Organized 3rd Brigade was struck again with disastrous result: after each of the two surviving regiments of the nationalist Newly Organized 3rd Brigade lost a battalion completely in the battle, the four surviving battalions of the two regiments of the nationalist Newly Organized 3rd Brigade disintegrated when the conscripts in the surviving units deserted en masse. The nationalist Newly Organized 3rd Brigade ceased to function and only existed in names on papers, and after the devastating defeat, regions including Dragon Gulf (Longhaiwan, ÈæôÊµ∑Êπæ), Bear's Mouth (Xiongkou, ÁÜäÂè£), Han River Mouth (Hanhekou, Ê±âÊ≤≥Âè£), and Dafengkou (Â§ß‰∏∞Âè£) fell back into the communist hand by late April in a domino effect. As warlords' armies begun to crumble, the strategic reserve, Chiang Kai-shek's own troop, the 10th Army could not offer any help because of the heightened tension between Chiang and warlords in Guangdong and Guangxi, so the 10th Army was redeployed to Changsha for the preparation to face off the warlords from the two provinces in case war broke out. Taking advantage of the infighting among the nationalists themselves, the communist force on the northern bank of the Yangtze River attacked toward Jiangling County, and by early June 1931, in a series of battles fought in the regions of Three Official's Palace (Sanguandian, ‰∏âÂÆòÊÆø), Sand Hill (Shagang, Ê≤ôÂ≤ó), Puji Temple (Pujiguan, ÊôÆÊµéËßÇ), Haoxue (ÈÉùÁ©¥), and Wang Family's Bridge (Wanjiaqiao, Ê±™ÂÆ∂Ê°•), communist force on the northern bank of the Yangtze River succeed in killing over two thousand nationalist troops, capturing more than a thousand guns from the defeated nationalists. The communist force on the southern bank of the Yangtze River also made impressive gains in that it retook the Eastern Mountain region, but during the process, their commander- in-chief Zhou Yiqun was killed in action in a battle near Yueyang. However, this nationalist achievement was not enough to avert the strategic failure of the encirclement campaign and the nationalists were forced to withdraw and call off the campaign. The communists not only successfully defended their base, but also further strengthened it by expanding into the regions around Tongting Lake, and the communist force on the southern bank of the Yangtze River crossed the Yangtze River after the campaign, and reorganized into the 26th Regiment of the 9th Division of the 3rd Army of the Chinese Red Army.

Pakistan and the UAE enjoy close and fraternal relations, founded on cultural affinities, shared faith and traditions, and also geographic proximity and identity of interests. These relations date back to the UAE's formation in 1971, and have since evolved into wide-ranging co-operation in various fields. Pakistan was the first country to extend recognition of the United Arab Emirates, while the UAE continues to be a major donor of economic and financial assistance to Pakistan. UAE recognizes Pakistan's contribution to the evolution of key institutions in the Emirates while Pakistan recognizes UAE's investment in Pakistan's economy and infrastructure. Both countries populations share the same faith and are majorly Muslim. In recognition of the UAE's humanitarian support to Pakistan, multiple institutions, bridges, airports and hospitals in Pakistan are named after the UAE's founding father and first president, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, such as the Sheikh Zayed Bridge in Swat Valley and Sheikh Zayed Medical Complex in Lahore.  History  After the British residency in the Trucial States ended, Pakistan called for the UAE the successor of the Trucial States to include Bahrain and Qatar as states of the United Arab Emirates, this however never materialised and relations with the United Arab Emirates were established in 1971. The UAE's founding father and first president Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan made multiple visits to Pakistan and considered it to be his second home. Pakistan have over the years played a vital role in establishing Emirati firms. In 1985, it was Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), the country‚Äôs national carrier, that Dubai turned to when founding its new airline, Emirates. PIA provided technical and administrative assistance to Emirates and leased two aircraft to the new company. As an acknowledgement of its contribution, Emirates selected Karachi as the first destination for its first flight. Throughout history, multiple frequent exchanges of high level visits and regular bilateral consultations between the two countries continue to occur and are reflective of the fact that Pakistan and UAE have laid strong foundations of mutually beneficial relations, friendship and peaceful cooperation over the years. The UAE has emerged as one of Pakistan's major economic and trading partners. Many Pakistani expatriates, numbering nearly 1.2 million are gainfully employed in UAE. The Pakistani expatriates in UAE have contributed in a significant manner to promotion of bilateral understanding and to the economy of Pakistan through their home remittances. The relationship between the two has been dubbed as a special relationship. Pakistanis are the second largest group of foreign residents living in the country. The UAE also has a long cricket relationship with Pakistan, serving as a home ground for the Pakistan cricket team for the past few decades. In 2014, trade between the two countries was valued at $9 billion. In December 2019, the UAE deposited $3 billion in the State Bank of Pakistan to enhance the bank‚Äôs liquidity and foreign currency reserves. However, in recent years, the relationship has been somewhat complicated by the UAE and Pakistan expanding their ties with one another's regional rivals, Qatar and India respectively.https://www.firstpost.com/world/dubai-police- chief-dhahi-khalfans-stinging-tweets-on-pakistan-more-than-outburst-reveal- islamabads-unsteady-relations-with-saudi-led-gcc- bloc-4418471.htmlhttps://www.firstpost.com/politics/where-does-india-uae- strategic-partnership-leave-pakistan-2396814.html In addition, the UAE is opposed to Pakistan's Gwadar Port project with China.http://csef.ru/en/politica-i-geopolitica/326/novyj-dubaj-kakim-obrazom- pakistanskij-port-gvadar-ugrozhaet-regionalnoj-roli-oae-8202 As of 2019, relations again began to improve substantially, with the UAE willing to invest $5 billion in Pakistan's Balochistan province, in order to build an oil refinery.https://www.arabnews.pk/node/1563861/pakistan https://www.dawn.com/news/1508944/uae-to-invest-5bn-in-oil-refinery-project- in-pakistan-by-end-of-2019-report During the COVID-19 pandemic the UAE had started free testing of Pakistanis residing in the Emirates. On 5 May 2020, the authorities of Pakistan raised an issue regarding the repatriation of their citizens from the United Arab Emirates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reuters reported that according to Pakistani officials, the Pakistani workers returning from the Gulf nation had high number of COVID-19 patients. The ministry spokeswoman, Aisha Farooqui highlighted that the situation was officially addressed to the UAE authorities, where the virus was believed to be spreading due to the crowded living conditions in the Emirates. The Pakistani envoy in the UAE refuted the media reports on the high number of Pakistanis being repatriated while being infected, calling them \\"exaggerated\\". The UAE Foreign Ministry stated ‚ÄúEveryone on UAE repatriation flights has been tested before departure, and those found to be infected were not allowed to travel.‚Äù UAE Pakistan Assistance Program On 12 January 2011, the UAE Pakistan Assistance Program (UAE-PAP) was launched in order to help and provide assistance to Pakistan and mitigate the impact of floods by redeveloping infrastructure, as per the directives of Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of the United Arab Emirates. The UAE PAP has worked along a comprehensive redevelopment plan that takes into account the harsh geography and the rough weather conditions of Pakistan while focusing on four main areas of social redevelopment: health, education, water and infrastructure. The Program has taken some vital steps to help the people of Swat district as it provided for the construction of two bridges, 52 schools and 7 hospitals, as well as the initiation of 64 water supply schemes. The program is dedicated to help combat a number of humanitarian crisis in Pakistan. The program aims to support efforts in fighting poverty, develop education, advance healthcare services, and contribute to the creation of new job opportunities for Pakistanis. Under the program, a number of projects such as infrastructure, education, healthcare and access to drinking water have been launched. As of October 2019, more than 30,000 Pakistani students have been enrolled in Schools built by the UAE-PAP in Swat District. In May 2018, the UAE channeled $200 million into the UAE-PAP. The UAE has also orchestrated multiple campaigns to eradicate polio in Pakistan. Since 2014, more than hundreds of millions of polio vaccine were delivered to around 71 million children in Pakistan. Military relations Emirati F-16's, an Emirati Mirage 2000, and a Pakistani F-7, left to right, fly in formation during a multinational exercise, Dec. 9, 2009. Defence relations between Pakistan and the UAE began shortly before the UAE's formation in 1971. Pakistani troops imparted training to members of the Abu Dhabi defence forces as far back as 1968, upon the request of the founder of the UAE Sheikh Zayed, as the British were about to hand over command of the Gulf Trucial States. A protocol was signed in the mid 1970s, and defence cooperation continued for the succeeding decades. Both countries share geographical proximity and a longstanding history of bilateral relations. The Pakistan Army established an armour training school in the UAE, and provided training to UAE commando battalions, as well as all armed and artillery corps officers. Pakistani personnel also held prominent positions as advisers and trainers in the UAE Air Force (UAEAF). The UAEAF is dubbed by Pakistani author Shahid Amin to have been \\"an extension of the Pakistan Air Force\\" at one point. The first Chief of Air Staff of the UAE, appointed by Sheikh Zayed, was Air Cdre Ayaz Ahmed Khan, followed by Ghulam Haider, Jamal A. Khan and Feroz A. Khan, all of whom were Pakistan Air Force (PAF) officers. In total, the first five Chiefs of Air Staff of the UAE Air Force were Pakistanis. The succeeding commanders were native officers, although group captain ranked officers of the PAF continued serving as Deputy Chief of Air Staff. As of 2004, the UAEAF had around 55 Pakistani flying instructors, and there were a few number of Pakistani personnel serving in the UAE Army and Navy. Officers of the Pakistan Navy have served in the UAE while training the local naval force.

Early life White was born in 1906, the daughter of Abram Isaac Elkus and Gertrude Rosalie Hess. Her father was appointed by Woodrow Wilson to be the United States Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. She lived in Constantinople while her father was ambassador there from 1916 to 1919. The family later settled in Red Bank, New Jersey. She graduated from Vassar College in 1928, and on October 3, 1929 married Arthur J. White, a stockbroker who later became the executive secretary of the New York Clothing Manufacturers Exchange. They raised two children in Red Bank (Lawrence Elkus White, b. 1931, and Frances Elkus White, b. 1933). Political career White became involved in local Democratic politics and unsuccessfully ran for Red Bank Borough Council in 1933, losing by thirteen votes. She also ran unsuccessfully as a Democratic candidate from Monmouth County for the State Assembly in 1934, and for Monmouth County Board of Freeholders in 1935. She was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1936, 1940, 1944, and 1948. In 1940 she became a member of the New Jersey Democratic State Committee and would later serve as vice-chair in 1954. In 1950 she ran for Mayor of Red Bank, as the Democratic candidate in a predominantly Republican town. She defeated her Republican opponent, Stanley O. Wilkins, and was sworn in on January 1, 1951 as Red Bank's first female mayor and the first Democrat to serve in more than twenty years. She was re- elected twice, remaining Mayor until 1956. In 1954, Governor Robert B. Meyner appointed her a commissioner of the New Jersey Highway Authority, which operated the Garden State Parkway. In 1955 she became chairman of the Highway Authority, a position she held for ten years. She was the first woman in the United States to head a toll road body. In 1960 she ran for the 3rd congressional district in the House of Representatives, in an unsuccessful bid to unseat incumbent James C. Auchincloss. In 1961 she was named acting New Jersey State Treasurer. Diplomatic career and later life On March 4, 1964, at a Women's National Press Club dinner, President Lyndon Johnson announced White's appointment as United States Ambassador to Denmark. At the same time Johnson also named nine other women to federal posts, pledging an end to \\"stag Government.\\" White served as Ambassador until 1968. After her retirement, she returned to Red Bank, where she worked with local and national organizations, including the United Negro College Fund. She also served on the Board of Governors of Rutgers University from 1976 to 1980. White died at the Riverview Medical Center in Red Bank at the age of 78.

Lloyd E. Ohlin, Expert on Crime and Punishment, Is Dead at 90, The New York Times, January 3, 2009. Accessed January 5, 2009. Life and career Ohlin was born on August 27, 1918, in Belmont, Massachusetts, the son of Elise (Nelson) and Emil Ohlin, Swedish-born immigrants. He received a bachelor's degree in 1940 from Brown University and was awarded a master's degree in sociology from Indiana University in 1942. He later earned a Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Chicago in 1954. He served in the United States Army during World War II, performing counterintelligence in Europe. During the Korean War, he investigated conditions in Korean prisoner-of-war camps for George Washington University's Human Resources Research Office. From 1947 to 1953, Ohlin was a sociologist for the Illinois Parole and Pardon Board where he was responsible for interviewing prospective parolees and making recommendations to the board for their consideration. He directed the Center for Education and Research in Corrections at the University of Chicago from 1953 to 1956. He was hired by the New York School of Social Work in 1956, and was later named director of the school's research center. Together with fellow sociologist Richard A. Cloward, Ohlin wrote Delinquency and Opportunity: A Theory of Delinquent Gangs, which rejected the prevailing assumption that delinquency resulted from irresponsibility of youths and argued that it was a symptom of poverty and the lack of alternative opportunities caused by poverty, and that the conditions underlying delinquency could be resolved through social programs in local communities that addressed the essential causes. As he told the New York Post in 1961, \\"The boy who joins a gang isn‚Äôt in a rut. He has aspirations, but no place to go with them.\\" In the late 1950s, Ohlin was part of the development of Mobilization for Youth, a $12.9 million antipoverty program that was initiated in the early 1960s to prevent delinquency on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. the program was based on principles established by Ohlin in Delinquency and Opportunity, offering job training, psychological counseling, drug treatment and legal assistance, as part of a program that became a prototype for future antipoverty programs administered by the United States government. He joined the faculty of Harvard Law School in 1967 where he was one of the few faculty members who was not an attorney. With his role as research director of Harvard's Center for Criminal Justice, Ohlin focused on investigating the risks that imprisonment poses, especially for young people. In a February 1968 speech in Boston delivered at the 15th annual Legislative Clearing House, Ohlin made the point by stating that \\"by doing nothing but processing children who get into trouble routinely through an overcrowded correctional system, we do more to develop than to stop career criminals\\".Marquard, Bryan. \\"Lloyd Ohlin, at 90; taught criminal law at Harvard\\", The Boston Globe, December 29, 2008.

In addition to his stint as president of the American Society of Criminology, Ohlin devoted time to public service in a number of presidential administrations, including as special consultant on delinquency to the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare under John F. Kennedy, as associate director of the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice under Lyndon B.

The country has the largest number of sites declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO in the Americas. Prehispanic Period Important archaeological finds of the remains of structures built by the indigenous peoples of Mexico have been made in the country. The Mesoamerican civilizations that arose there developed a sophisticated architecture that evolved from simplistic to complex forms; in the north it was manifested in buildings of adobe and stone, the multi-storied housing as seen in Paquim√©, and the cave dwellings of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Monte Alb√°n was long the seat of the dominant political power in the Central Valleys of Oaxaca, from the decline of San Jos√© Mogote until the demise of the city, which occurred around the 9th century. The native name of this city founded by the Zapotecs in the late Preclassic is still the subject of discussion. According to some sources, the original name was Dani Ba√°. It is known, however, that the local Mixtec called the city Yuku k√∫i (Green Hill) in their language. Uxmal Tenochtitlan benches detail Atlantes at Tula Comalcalco is only Mayan city built of baked brick and stucco. Like most of the great Mesoamerican cities, Monte Alb√°n was a city with a multi-ethnic population. Throughout its history, the city maintained strong ties to other peoples in Mesoamerica, especially with the Teotihuacans during the early Classic period. The city was abandoned by the social elite and much of the rest of its population at the end of Phase Xoo. However, the ceremonial enclosure that constitutes the complex of the archeological site of Monte Alb√°n was reused by the Mixtec during the Postclassic period. By this time, the Zapotec people's political power was divided among various city-states, including Zaachila, Yagul, Lambityeco and Tehuantepec. The Maya appear to have founded Lakam Ha about 100 B.C., during the Formative period (2500 B.C. ‚Äì 300 A.D.), predominantly as a farmers' village favored by the numerous springs and streams nearby. The population of Lakam Ha grew during the Early Classic period (200‚Äì600) as it became a full-fledged city; during the Late Classic period (600‚Äì900) it was made the capital of the B'akaal (bone) region in Chiapas and Tabasco. The oldest of the structures that have been discovered were built around the year 600. B'akaal was an important center of Mayan civilization between the 5th and 9th centuries, during which it formed various, shifting alliances, and fought numerous wars with its enemies. On more than one occasion it made an alliance with Tikal, the other great Mayan city of the time, to contain the spread of militant Calakmul, also called the \\"Kingdom of the Serpent\\". Calakmul won two of these wars, in 599 and 611. B'akaal rulers claimed that their royal lineage originated in the distant past, some even boasting that their genealogy dated to the creation of the world, which in Mayan mythology was in the year 3114 B.C. Modern archaeological theories speculate that the first dynasty of their rulers was probably of Olmec ethnicity. During the Tollan phase, the city reached its greatest extent and population. Some authors estimate the urban area of Tollan-Xicocotitlan at the time was between 5 and 16 km¬≤, with a population of between 16,000 and 55,000 people. During this phase the monumental space that constitutes the Tula archaeological zone was consolidated in two pyramidal bases, two courts for the ballgame and several palaces occupied by the Toltec elite. By this time, Tollan-Xicocotitlan had become not only the nexus of the Mesoamerican commercial networks, it also hosted a military-theocratic elite who imposed their rule in various parts of Mesoamerica, whether by military conquest or political alliance, or by establishing colonies in strategic places. Teotihuacan was listed as a World Heritage Site by Unesco in 1987. Teotihuacan archaeological excavations continue to this day, and have resulted in a gradual increase in the quality and quantity of knowledge of the city's history; even so, such important facts as its original name and the ethnic affiliation of its founders are still unknown. It is known that it was a cosmopolitan place, however, by the documented presence of groups from the Gulf coast or the Central Valleys of Oaxaca. Located in the modern town of the same name, Tzintzuntzan was the ceremonial center of the pre-Columbian Tarascan state capital. Its ruins are situated on a large artificial platform excavated into the Yahuarato hillside, with a commanding view of Lake P√°tzcuaro. There, five rounded pyramids called \\"Y√°catas\\" face the lake. The site has a small archaeological museum. =Puuc style= The buildings of Chichen Itza show a large number of architectural and iconographic elements that some historians have called Mexicanized. The influence of cultures from central Mexico, mixed with the Puuc style of the upper peninsula, is visible in its Classic Maya architecture. The presence of these elements from the cultures of the Mexican Plateau was conjectured recently to have been a result of a mass migration to, or conquest of, the Mayan city by Toltec groups. However, recent studies suggest that they may have been the cultural expression of a prestigious and widespread political system during the Early Postclassic in Mesoamerica. Temple of Warriors in Chich√©n Itz√°, Mexico. =Oasisamerican style= The adobe houses of the troglodytes of Cuarenta Casas Oasisamerican peoples, whose influence was marked primarily by commercial exchanges between the north and south of Mexico, had widespread contact with the other peoples of Mesoamerica in the Northern Hemisphere, leading to a unique style of building construction in the Americas. The archaeological record of this style is scant compared to that of Chan Chan in northern Peru. Paquim√© was a prehistoric settlement that had cultural influence in the northwest of the Sierra Madre Occidental, most of modern-day western Chihuahua and some areas of what is now the states of Sonora, Arizona, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico. Researchers estimate that the population probably grew to about 3,500 inhabitants, but their linguistic and ethnic affiliation is unknown. The site is known for its adobe buildings and their \\"T\\" form doors. Only a fraction of its total length is fenced and less is excavated. Its buildings have traits of Oasisamerican culture and demonstrate the skill of the Prehispanic architects of the region who designed multifamily adobe houses up to four stories high utilizing wood, reed, and stone as supplementary building materials. Colonial Period The Cathedral of M√©rida, Yucat√°n is an example of Renaissance style. With the establishment of Spanish rule in Mexico, the first churches and monasteries were built utilizing architectural principles of classical order and the Arabic formalities of Spanish mud√©jarismo. Great cathedrals and civic buildings were later built in the Baroque and Mannerist styles, while in rural areas estate manor houses and hacienda buildings incorporated Mozarabic elements. The syncretic Indian- Christian mode of architecture developed organically as Indians interpreted European architectural and decorative features in the native, pre-Columbian style called tequitqui (\\"laborer\\" or \\"mason\\", from Nahuatl). Organizing local indigenous communities around monastic centers was one of the solutions devised by friars of the mendicant orders in the 16th century to convert the large number of indigenous non-Catholics in New Spain. These were conceived of as fortresses, but based architecturally on the European conventual model, incorporating new features such as the open chapel and atriums with a stone cross at the center; they were characterized by different decorative elements. Early in the history of the Indian reductions (reducciones de indios), the convents became community training centers, so to speak, where the Indians could learn various arts and trades as well as European social customs and the Spanish language, obtain medical treatment, and even hold funerals. These buildings, spread across the central part of what is now Mexico, contain superb examples of the indigenous mastery of architecture and the sculptural arts. Their work, created under the supervision of the Catholic friars, was done in the tequitqui style, which originated in the architectural stone carving and decorative painting practiced by their ancestors before the Spanish conquest. The first cathedrals in Mexico were built beginning in 1521 when New Spain was established; from that time onward ever more elaborate structures were built, a prime example being the M√©rida Cathedral in Yucat√°n, built in the Renaissance architectural style and one of the oldest cathedrals in the New World. =Mexican Baroque= Central courtyard of the government palace of Michoac√°n. The dominant form of art and architecture during most of the colonial period was Baroque. In 1577, Pope Gregory XIII created the Academy of Saint Luke with the purpose of breaking with Renaissance style. Its aim was to use painting and sculpture in and on churches to create iconography to teach and reinforce Church doctrine. In Spain, the first works in Baroque include the Patio of the Kings in El Escorial monastery.Rosas Volume 5, p.2-3. Spanish Baroque was transplanted to Mexico and developed its own varieties from the late 16th to late 18th centuries.Rosas Volume 4, p.14. Baroque art and architecture were mostly applied to churches. One reason for this was that in nearly all cities, towns and villages, the church was the center of the community, with streets in a regular pattern leading away from it. This reflected the Church‚Äôs role as the center of community life. Church design in New Spain tended to follow the rectilinear pattern of squares and cubes, rather than contemporary European churches that favored curves and orbs.Rosas Volume 5, p.6. The spaces of Mexican Baroque churches tend to be more introverted than their European counterparts, focusing especially on the main altar. The purpose was contemplation and meditation. The rich ornamentation was created to keep attention focused on the central themes. This was especially true of the main altar.Rosas Volume 5, p.7. Columns and pilasters were an important element of Mexican Baroque style, in particular the part of the column between the capital and the base, which can be categorized in six types including Salomonic and estipite (an inverted truncated pyramid) in the later colonial period. Even if the rest of the structure was not covered in decoration, such as in the ‚Äúpurist‚Äù style, columns and spaces between doubled columns were profusely decorated.Rosas Volume 5, p.11.Rosas Volume 5, p.12-13. As it developed in Mexico, the Baroque split into a number of sub-styles and techniques. ‚ÄúEstucado‚Äù Baroque was purely decorative and did not employ any architectural features. Features were molded from stucco with intricate detail and either covered in gold leaf or paint. This form reached its height in the 17th century in Puebla and Oaxaca. Surviving examples include the Chapel del Rosario in Puebla and the Church at Tonantzintla. One reason this style fell out of favor was that the stucco work eventually dissolved.Rosas Volume 5, p.8-9. Church of San Francisco Acatepec with Baroque Talavera tiling Talavera Baroque was a variety mostly confined to the states of Puebla and Tlaxcala. The main defining feature was the use of hand-painted ceramic tiles of the Talavera type. This style came into being here because of the pottery industry. Tiles are mostly found on the bell towers, domes and main portals of the exterior. They are also found interspersed on the rest of the facade as accents to brickwork. This type of Baroque first appeared in the 17th century and reached its height in the 18th. While wholesale use of this style is mostly confined to two states, elements of this tile work appear, especially in domes, in many other parts of the country.Rosas Volume 5, p.10. In the late Baroque era artists in the provincial area of New Spain created intricately textured church facades and interiors similar to those of the major cities. It had a more two-dimensional quality, which led it to be called Mestizo Baroque or Folk Baroque. The two-level effect was less based on sculptural modeling and more on drilling into the surface to create a screen-like effect. This has some similarities to pre-Hispanic stone and wood carving, allowing elements of indigenous art tradition to survive. Other Baroque styles in Mexico did not adorn all of the surfaces of the interior or exterior but focused their ornamentation on columns, pilasters and the spaces between pairs of these supports. Medallions and niches with statues commonly appear between columns and pilasters, especially around main portals and windows. Decorative patterns in columns after were wavy grooves (called estr√≠as m√≥viles). Metropolitan Cathedral of Mexico City Details of the Altar of the Kings in the Mexico City Cathedral Another late Baroque style in Mexico is often called Mexican Churrigueresque after the Spanish Churriguera family, who made altarpieces at this time. However, the more technical term for this very exuberant, anti- classical style is ultra Baroque. It originated in Spain as architectural decoration, spreading to sculpture and furniture carving. In Spain, the definitive element of ultra Baroque was the use of the Salomonic column along with the profuse decoration.Rosas Volume 5, p.5. In Mexico, the Salomonic column appears as well but the main distinctive aspect of Mexican ultra Baroque is the use of the estipite column in both buildings and altarpieces. This is not a true column, but rather an elongated base in the form of an inverted, truncated pyramid. This can be seen in the Mexico City Cathedral in the Altar of the Kings and the main portal of the Tabernacle. Ultra Baroque was introduced by Jer√≥nimo Balb√°s into Mexico, whose design for an altar at the Seville Cathedral was the inspiration for the Altar of the Kings, constructed in 1717. Balb√°s used est√≠pites to convey a sense of fluidity, but his Mexican followers flattened the facades and aligned the est√≠pites, with less dynamic results. This is what Lorenzo Rodr√≠guez did to Balb√°s design for the Altar of the Kings. He also created a stronger horizontal division between the first and second levels, which derived Mexican ultra Baroque from the Spanish version. The ultra Baroque appeared when Mexican mines were producing great wealth, prompting numerous building projects. Much of Mexican ultra Baroque can be seen in and the city of Guanajuato and its mines. For this reason, the style became more developed in Mexico than in Spain. Exterior panoramic of the Mission San Xavier del Bac. The combination of Indian and Arabic decorative influences, with an extremely expressive interpretation of the churrigueresque, could explain the variety and intensity of the Baroque in New Spain. Even more than its Spanish counterpart, the American Baroque developed as a style of stucco decoration. Twin towers facades of many American cathedrals of the 17th century have medieval roots. To the north, the richest province of the 18th century, New Spain, the current Mexico, was an architecture fantastically extravagant and visually frenetic that is Mexican churrigueresque. This ultrabaroque style culminates in the works of Lorenzo Rodr√≠guez, whose masterpiece is the Sagrario Metropolitano in Mexico City (1749-1769). Other notable examples are in remote mining towns. For example, the sanctuary of Ocotl√°n (begun in 1745) is a first-Baroque cathedral, whose surface is covered with bright red tiles, which contrast with a plethora of compressed ornament applied generously on the front and sides of the towers. The true capital of Mexican Baroque is Puebla, where the abundance of hand- painted tiles and local gray stone led to a very personal and localized evolution of style, with a pronounced Indian flavor. Church of Santa Prisca in Taxco, Mexican churrigueresque. The New Spanish Baroque is an artistic movement that appeared in what is now Mexico in the late 16th century, approximately, which was preserved until the mid-18th century. From the Portuguese word barrueco meaning unclean, mottled, flamboyant, daring, the most striking example of New Spanish Baroque art is in religious architecture, where indigenous artisans gave it a unique character. Highlights include the Metropolitan Cathedral of Mexico City with his Altar of the Kings, the church of Santa Mar√≠a Tonantzintla in the Puebla State, the Jesuit convent of Tepotzotl√°n in the State of Mexico, the Chapel of the Rosary in the church of Santo Domingo of the city of Puebla, the convent and the church of Santo Domingo de Guzm√°n in Oaxaca, and the church of Santa Prisca in Taxco, Guerrero State. Entry to the Biblioteca Palafoxiana The Biblioteca Palafoxiana, considered by some historians the first public library in the Americas, was founded in 1646 by Bishop Juan de Palafox y Mendoza of Puebla, with a gift of 5,000 volumes to the Colegio de San Juan (which he had also founded), on the condition that they be made available to the general public, and not just to ecclesiastics and seminarians. More than a century later, Francisco Fabi√°n y Fuero ordered the construction of the premises which currently house the library in the vaulted hall on the Colegio's second floor. This was finished in 1773, and has two levels of bookshelves and a retablo, or altarpiece, a delicate work which houses an image of the Madonna of Trapani, an oil painting presumably modeled on the sculpture carved by the Sicilian master Nino Pisano in the mid-14th century. The bookshelves were the work of the viceregal cabinetmakers who carved in ayacahuite pine, cedar, and coloyote wood. The size of the collection continually increased, and a third level of bookshelves was added in the mid-19th century. =Neoclassicism= Palacio de Miner√≠a, Mexico City, designed by Manuel Tols√° As part of the Spanish Enlightenment's cultural impact on New Spain, the crown established Academy of San Carlos in 1785 to train painters, sculptors, and architects in New Spain, under the direction of peninsular Spaniard Ger√≥nimo Antonio Gil.Jean Charlot, Mexican Art and the Academy of San Carlos, 1785-1915. Austin: University of Texas Press 1962, p. 25 The academy emphasized neoclassicism, which drew on the inspiration of the clean lines of Greek and Roman architecture. Neoclassicism in architecture was directly linked to crown policies that sought to rein in the exuberance of the baroque, considered in \\"bad taste\\" and creating public buildings of \\"good taste\\" funded by the crown, such as the Palacio de Miner√≠a in Mexico City and the Hospicio Caba√±as in Guadalajara, and the Alh√≥ndiga de Granaditas in Guanajuato, all built in the late colonial era.James Oles, Art and Architecture in Mexico. London: Thames and Hudson 2013, pp.132-33, 150. 19th and early 20th century architecture Monument to Cuauht√©moc, Mexico City Monument to the Revolution Townscapes changed little during the first half of the 19th century in Mexico, until the French occupation during the Second Mexican Empire in the mid 1860s. Emperor Maximilian I brought a new set of urban design ideas to Mexico. Drawing from the mid-century Parisian redevelopment plan of Baron Haussmann, Maximillain administered the building of a broad new diagonal avenue- Paseo de la Reforma. This elegant boulevard ran for miles from the downtown National Palace to the lush Chapultepec Park where the Austrian ruler lived in the Chapultepec Castle. Along the broad Reforma, double rows of eucalyptus trees were planted, gas lamps installed, and the first mule-drawn streetcars were introduced. The development was the catalyst for a new phase of growth from downtown Mexico City to the west, a direction that would define the city's structure for the next half century. During President Porfirio D√≠az's terms (1876‚Äì1880, 1884‚Äì1911), patrons and practitioners of architecture manifested two impulses: to create an architecture that would indicate Mexico's participation in modernity and the emphasize Mexico's difference from other countries through the incorporation of local characteristics into the architecture. The first goal took precedence over the second during most of the 19th century. Major infrastructure projects of building a railway network and a sanitation project to drain the central lake system (the desag≈±e) near Mexico City necessitated the civil engineers and architects. Railway stations and bridges across ravines were designed and built. Old colonial buildings in the capital, such as the Nacional Palace, were refurbished, and the new penitentiary of Lecumberri was designed, conforming to the precepts of Jeremy Betham's panopticon. A modern, sophisticated Mexico City was the goal of President Diaz. Cast iron technology from Europe and the United States allowed for new building designs. Italian marble, European granite, bronzes and stained glass could now be imported. Diaz was determined to transform the landscape of the nation's capital into one reminiscent of Paris or London. It is not surprising that the most important architectural commissions of the Porfiriato were given to foreigners. Italian architect Adamo Boari designed the Postal Palace built by Gonzalo Garita (1902) and the National Theatre of Mexico (1904). The French architect √âmile B√©nard, who worked on the Legislative Palace in 1903, founded an architectural studio where he took Mexican students. Silvio Contri was responsible for the Secretariat of Communications and Public Works (1902‚Äì11). Neo-Gothic designs incorporated into the monumental public buildings of the early 20th century. The two best examples were the Central post office and the Palacio de Bellas Artes, designed by Italian architect Adamo Boari. President Diaz had enacted a decree in 1877 that called for the placement of a series of political statues of Mexican heroes along the Paseo de la Reforma. Classical designs were used to build structures such as the Angel of Independence monument, the Monument to Cuauht√©moc, the monument to Benito Ju√°rez, and the Columbus Statue. Diaz's conviction about the importance of public monuments in the urban landscape started a tradition that has become permanent in Mexico: public monuments in the 20th century landscape. In the 19th century, Neo- Indigenist architecture played an active part of the representation of national identity as constructed by the Porfirian regime. The representation of the local in Mexican architecture was achieved mainly through themes and decorative motifs inspired by pre-Hispanic antiquity. These representations were essential to the construction of a common heritage by which the nation might be unified. The first building based on the ancient Mexican motifs built in the 19th century was the Monument to Cuauht√©moc executed by engineer Francisco Jim√©nez and the sculptor Miguel Nore√±a. Other 19th-century buildings incorporating pre-Hispanic decorative motifs include the monument to Benito Juarez in Paseo Juarez, Oaxaca (1889). At the beginning of the 20th century, Luis Zalazar enthusiastically encouraged architects to create a national style of architecture based on the study of pre-Hispanic ruins. His writings would be influential for the nationalistic tendencies in Mexican architecture which developed during the second and third decade of the 20th century. After the Mexican Revolution, successive Mexican regimes would use the pre-Hispanic past to represent the nation. Later architects also took inspiration from the architecture of the colonial period and regional architecture as the creation of a genuinely Mexican architecture became a pressing issue during the 20th century. Modern and contemporary architecture Fifteen years after the end of the Mexican Revolution in 1917, government endorsements for federal housing, educational, and health care building programs began. While the development of modern architecture in Mexico bears some noteworthy parallels to its North American and European counterparts, its trajectory highlights several unique characteristics, which challenged existing definitions modern architecture. During the post-Revolutionary period, idealization of the indigenous and the traditional symbolized attempts to reach into the past and retrieve what had been lost in the race toward modernization. Functionalism, expressionism, and other schools have left their imprint on a large number of works in which Mexican stylistic elements have been combined with European and North American techniques. The Institute of Hygiene (1925) in Popotla, Mexico, by Jos√© Villagr√°n Garc√≠a, was one of the first examples of this new national architecture. The studio designed by Juan O'Gorman in San Angel, Mexico City, for Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo (1931‚Äì32) is a fine example of vanguard architecture built in Mexico. =Mid-century Modern= Mexico's first project of high-density, low-cost housing was the Centro Urbano Alem√°n (1947‚Äì49), Mexico City, by Mario Pani. Perhaps the most ambitious project of modern architecture was the construction, begun in 1950, of Ciudad Universitaria outside Mexico City, a complex of buildings and grounds housing the National Autonomous University of Mexico. A cooperative venture, the project was directed by Carlos Lazo, Enrique Del Moral, and Pani. In the new campus the art of the Mexican muralists was incorporated into the architecture, beginning with Rivera's relief in the new Estadio Ol√≠mpico Universitario (1952), by Augusto P√©rez Palacios, Jorge Bravo, and Ra√∫l Salinas. The Rectory (1952), by Pani, del Moral, and Salvador Ortega Flores, includes murals by David Alfaro Siqueiros. The Science Building was designed by Eugenio Peschard and features the mural, The Conquest of Energy, by Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado. Perhaps the most famous integration of mural art with the architecture is seen in the University Library, by O‚ÄôGorman, Gustavo Saavedra, and Juan Mart√≠nez de Velasco, which features a monumental mosaic design on the facade by O‚ÄôGorman. Another architect of note is Felix Candela (Spanish), who designed the expressionistic church Nuestra Se√±ora de los Milagros. This was a period of diverse experimentation and even structural innovation, as seen in the thin- shell concrete structures by the Spanish architect Felix Candela, such as his Church of the Miraculous Virgin (1953) in Mexico City and the Cosmic Rays Pavilion (1951) on the university campus. The integration of art and architecture became a constant in Mexican modern architecture, which can be seen in the courtyard of the Anthropology Museum (c. 1963‚Äì65) in Mexico City, by Pedro Ram√≠rez V√°zquez. Another side of Mexican modern architecture is represented in the work of Luis Barrag√°n. The houses that he designed in the 1950s and ‚Äô60s explored a way to reconcile the lessons of Le Corbusier with the Spanish colonial tradition. This new synthesis created a completely original Modernist architecture that is uniquely adapted to its environment.

The School of Theatre (1994), by TEN Arquitectos, and the School of Dance (1994), by Luis Vicente Flores, express a modernity that reinforces the government's desire to present a new image of Mexico as an industrialized country with a global presence. Enrique Norten, the founder of TEN Arquitectors, was presented with the \\"Legacy Award\\" by the Smithsonian Institution for his contributions to the US arts and culture through his work. In 2005 he received the \\"Leonardo da Vinci\\" World Award of Arts by the World Cultural Council and was the first Mies van der Rohe Award recipient for Latin American Architecture. The refined work of Alberto Kalach and Daniel Alvarez stands out both in their numerous residences as well as in the San Juan de Letr√°n Station (1994) in Mexico City. The residential work of Jos√© Antonio Aldrete-Haas in Mexico City shows both the influence of the attenuated Modernism of the great Portuguese architect √Ålvaro Siza and a continuity with the lessons of Barrag√°n.

It is a common case of the use of a firearm as a blunt weapon. Buttstroke is among the major offensive techniques with the rifle and bayonet in close-at-hand combat and is the recommended method of close combat if the rifleman has no bayonet or sidearm available.  Effectiveness  U.S. Air Force trainee demonstrating a butt stroke on a strike dummy Despite technological changes modern soldiers continue to report that hand to hand combat is a continued occurrence in the field, with soldiers stressing the importance of training in grappling and the use of weapons in hand-to-hand combat. Techniques Buttstrokes are implemented by a variety of combatants, often trained in a series of transitioned movements to prevent wasted motion and ensure that aggressor is able to make repeated attacks or quickly parry or guard following a failed attempt. Buttstrokes can be combined with kicking and kneeing an opponents lower body to further increase effectiveness and provide more variety to routes of attack. Buttstrokes carry the risk of damaging ones weapon and by some schools of thought are considered best a method of last resort, recommending the use of bayonets if possible when engaged in close quarters combat. Even if relying primarily on bayonets, a buttstroke may still prove effective as a transitional move following a failed bayonet charge, bringing the butt of the gun in a vertical, upward swing into the combatants groin. Part of the butt stroke training regiment involves hitting padded dummies, alongside working through drills with partners in order to avoid damaging ones weapon. = United States Techniques = The 1918 United States Navy Landing- force Manual describes the following techniques of buttstroking which would be adopted by the United States National Guard and other branches of the military:Landing-force Manual, United States Navy, 1918 By United States Navy Dept, United States, pp. 508-510 (public domain)  Trench or Vertical Butt Strokes  *Buttstroke I ‚Äì Upward swing: Swing the butt up at the opponent's crotch, ribs, forearm, etc.,-using a half-arm blow or advancing the rear foot. Buttstroke I is essentially a half-arm blow from the shoulder, keeping the elbow rigid, and it can therefore be successfully employed only when the right hand is grasping the rifle at the small of the stock. *Buttstroke II ‚Äì Forward strike: If the opponent jumps back so that the first butt stroke misses, the rifle will come into a horizontal position over the left shoulder, butt leading; the attacker will then step in with the rear foot and dash the butt into his opponent's face. *Buttstroke III ‚Äì Downward cut: If the opponent retires still farther out of distance, the attacker again closes up and slashes his bayonet down on his opponent's head or neck. *Buttstroke IV ‚Äì Side blow: If a thrust has been made at an opponent and parried, the butt can be effectively used by stepping in with the rear foot swinging the rifle to the left and rear, so that the butt leads and is in front of the right forearm. Then dash the butt into the opponent's face, or against the side of his head or jaw. When the opponent is out of distance, butt stroke III can again be used. In individual fighting, the butt can also be used horizontally against the opponent's ribs, forearm, etc. This method is impossible in trench fighting or in an attack, owing to the horizontal sweep of the bayonet to the attacker's left.  Open Ground or Horizontal Butt Strokes  * Buttstroke I ‚Äì Advancing the rear foot, with a half-arm blow swing the butt up at the opponent's jaw with your right hand holding onto the small of the stock. * Buttstroke II ‚Äì If the opponent jumps back, causing the first stroke to miss, the rifle will come into a horizontal position over the left should, butt leading. the attack will the step in with the rear foot and slash the bayonet into the opponent's face.

Japan was among the first nations to recognize Pakistan's sovereignty, doing so three days after the latter's independence on 14 August 1947. Diplomatic relations between the two were officially established in April 1952 following the end of the Allied occupation of Japan. Pakistan played a major role in helping to lift the occupation as well as rebuilding the Japanese economy via mass exports and waiving war reparations owed to the country by Japan. The relationship between the two countries strengthened through the Cold War due to Pakistan's alliance with the U.S.-led Western Bloc, which Japan was a part of. Relations between Japan and Pakistan have generally remained stable, with the exception of the time period in which India and Pakistan were subject to Japanese sanctions due to their nuclear weapons tests in 1998. Relations have once again improved since then, with Pakistan receiving over ¬•260 billion in grants and aid from Japan as well as around ¬•3 billion in investments. As of 2015, there are around 968-2000 Japanese nationals residing in Pakistan whereas about 12,708 Pakistani nationals are residing in Japan. About 20,000 Japanese tourists visited Pakistan between 2007-2008 and continue to express an interest in doing so, focusing on Pakistan's Buddhist sites. Pakistan is primarily represented through its embassy in Tokyo and Japan is represented through its embassy in Islamabad. As of 2015, bilateral trade between Japan and Pakistan stood at US$1.9 billion. Post World War II The newly-founded Dominion of Pakistan played a significant role from 1947-51 in efforts to lift the Allied occupation of Japan and restoring Japan's sovereignty. Pakistan was described by U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles as the 'tower of strength' on the Treaty of San Francisco, a peace treaty signed between Japan and the Allies on 8 September 1951 in San Francisco. Unlike many other Asian countries, Pakistan waived war reparations from Japan to help the latter build its economy. Pakistan was also among the first few countries that ratified the Japanese peace treaty. Pakistan played a leading role in Japan's postwar economic revival in the 1950s by majorly exporting cotton and jute to Japan as textiles was practically the only industry allowed to continue under the Allied occupation. SCAP-Japan sent its first trade mission to Pakistan in May 1948, headed by R. Eaton. Two months later, Japan signed a trade agreement with Pakistan, which was also the first trade agreement signed by Japan with any country after the war. Much of Pakistan‚Äôs export was on deferred payment as Japan was short of foreign exchange. In exchange for cotton and jute, Pakistan imported textile machinery from Japan. Therefore, a mutually beneficial trade relationship emerged between them. Furthermore, a Japanese trading liaison agency was established in Karachi in 1948, which also served as a diplomatic source for Japan after the war. Pakistan sent its first trade mission to Japan under Mirza Abul Isphahani in September 1948 to review the Japanese textile industry for Pakistan‚Äôs benefit. Another SCAP-Japan trade mission, headed by E.B. Blatcheley, visited Pakistan in February 1949 and two more trade missions, led by B.W. Adams and A.B. Snell respectively, visited Pakistan to negotiate cotton and jute for the Japanese industry. These visits paved the way for many other trade delegations to Pakistan to enhance trade and to promote other economic activities between the two countries. Mutual diplomacy Before regular diplomatic relations were established between Pakistan and Japan, the trade liaison offices in Karachi and Tokyo, working since 1948, were the only sources of trade and diplomatic contacts. Both countries established regular diplomatic missions on 18 April 1952, just ten days after the ratification of the Japanese peace treaty. Therefore, Pakistan established diplomatic and trade contacts with Japan since 1948 ‚Äì long before Japanese sovereignty was restored by the Allied Powers. In order to meet the acute shortage of food in Japan caused after the war, Pakistan shipped 60,000 tons of rice through Nichimen vessels to Japan in 1952 and 1953 carrying the signboard ‚ÄòDonated Rice to the Emperor of Japan by the Government of Pakistan‚Äô. Such was the national sentiment between the two sides in the 1950s. High level exchanges Pakistan appointed Mian Ziauddin as its first Ambassador to Japan on 18 April 1952Who was soon replaced by Khan sahib Abdus Salim Khan in 1953 and Japan Ambassador Kiyoshi Yamagata arrived in Karachi on 4 September 1952. Pakistan and Japan exchanged high level visits in April and May 1957. Pakistan's Prime Minister Hussain Shaheed Suharawardy was the first Asian leader to visit Japan in April 1957, which opened up the door for Japan to come back to Asia after World War II. Within a month in May 1957, Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi undertook a visit to Pakistan, which was also the first ever visit by a Japanese Prime Minister to Asia after the end of World War II. However, they differed on the Kashmir dispute, One China policy, and the creation of an Asian Development Bank. Japan remained neutral on Kashmir and initially advocated a plebiscite in Kashmir but later changed its stance. Japan supported Taiwan against the People‚Äôs Republic of China (PRC) but Pakistan recognized the PRC as the sole and legitimate government of the people of China. Regarding the setting up of an Asian development bank, Pakistan wanted Japan to first establish and restore diplomatic relations with all Asian countries as they should not see an aggressive but a cooperative Japan. The mutual diplomacy, however, further encouraged the two sides to promote trading and economic ties, creating the environment for normalizing Japanese ties with other Asian nations such as China and the two Koreas. Moreover, Pakistan and Japan were important players in the US-led Cold War strategy in Asia ‚Äî Pakistan in South Asia and Japan in North East Asia. President Muhammad Ayub Khan paid a visit to Japan on 12‚Äì19 December 1960. The invitation was extended by Japanese Emperor Hirohito in February 1960, another unique aspect in their bilateral relations. Japan wanted to show that it had fully assimilated the spirit of the San Francisco treaty and was willing to boost relations with other Asian nations. For Pakistan, the visit was motivated by economic reasons. Moreover, the United States was encouraging cooperation between its two allies. Ayub‚Äôs visit was the ‚Äògrandest‚Äô event ever seen in Japan those days. He was received by the Emperor ‚Äì an extraordinary welcome as dignitaries were received by the prime minister. Strategically important was Ayub's stopover at Okinawa, a US marine base, where US High Commissioner General Donald Prentice Booth welcomed a non-American and non- Japanese leader to the base for the first time and offered him a Guard of Honour. This showed an explicit trust between Japanese, Americans, and Pakistanis during the Cold War. Following Ayub‚Äôs visit to Japan, Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda visited Pakistan on 17‚Äì20 November 1961 as part of his Asian tour. He offered a loan of 20 million yen ‚Äì Japan‚Äôs first ever to Pakistan (besides India). Promoting mutual diplomacy between Pakistan and Japan, Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko undertook a visit of Pakistan on 23‚Äì29 January 1962 to create the feeling of harmony in Asia, while reparations and normalization were still irritants in improving Japanese relations in Asia. In his welcome address the Emperor admired Japan‚ÄìPakistan ties: ‚ÄúBonded not only by age of old relationship of culture and civilization but also by the modern ties of trade and cooperation, both Japan and Pakistan have first developed a unique identify of thought and we are emphatic in our belief that in between themselves both the governments and the people of these two countries are by virtue of their deep-rooted love for peace capable of exercising an irresistible influence on world opinion‚Äù. Divergence The One China policy continued to drag Pakistan's relations with Japan on a different path, affecting the civil aviation agreement as Japan did not grant landing rights to Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) to fly from inside China in the 1960s. China was supportive of PIA‚Äôs proposed route but Japan did not agree, apparently under US pressure. Pakistan‚Äôs civil aviation route proposal was actually a step toward Sino-Japanese rapprochement, which Japan did not appreciate, thus creating cracks in Japan‚ÄìPakistan relations and pushing more Pakistan towards China and mending fences with Eastern Bloc countries sourced by the Cold War activities. East Pakistan debacle Nevertheless, Pakistan remained high on the Japanese Official Development Assistance (ODA) program and received around 18 percent of assistance disbursed during 1961-71. War in the former East Pakistan and Japanese Red Cross‚Äôs (Seki Juji) assistance to refugees who fled to Calcutta in India, however, created differences between Pakistan and Japan. Japan viewed the crisis in East Pakistan on the basis of Bengali nationalism and supported it. On the other hand, Japan did not support Vietnamese self-determination. Unlike with what Pakistan terms ‚Äúthe Kashmir dispute‚Äù, Japan did not adopt complete neutrality toward the issue of East Pakistan. Japanese political parties and social groups rendered support for the cause of the creation of Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Liberation War soon broke out in East Pakistan; Japan closed its Consulate-General in Dhaka and cut-off aid to Pakistan. Japan recognized Bangladesh within two months on 10 February 1972, inviting more Pakistan‚Äôs criticism. Half of Japan‚Äôs loans were consumed in East Pakistan and it refused to honor and payback those loans as Japan recognized Bangladesh before Pakistan made any decision. Decline of Japanese interest Moreover, Pakistan‚Äôs anti-West stance in the 1970s under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and his industrial nationalization policy resulted in the decline of Pakistan-Japan diplomatic interaction and decreased the interest of Japan entrepreneurs towards Pakistan. No high level exchanges took place during this period. In spite of these strategic changes in Pakistan‚Äôs foreign relations, Japan continued to be an important destination of Pakistan‚Äôs trade. Furthermore, the normalization of China‚ÄìJapan relations in the 1970s sent a positive message to promoting Japan‚ÄìPakistan ties, which were further strengthened during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in 1979. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan renewed the moment of Japan‚ÄìPakistan ties once again, and high level exchanges were made. Japan saw a common danger in the presence of Soviet forces in Afghanistan, since Japan‚Äôs energy lane passing through the Persian Gulf could have been jeopardized if the Soviets came to the warm-water ports in the Arabian Sea. Therefore, Japan extended full diplomatic and political support to Pakistan. Renewal of ties President General Muhammad Zia ul Haq visited Japan on 17‚Äì22 July 1983. Reciprocating, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone visited Pakistan on 30 April 3-May 1984, the first visit by a Japanese Minister in 23 years. His visit clearly indicated that Japan endorsed Pakistan‚Äôs policy toward Afghanistan. This was the revival of the Cold War understandings. After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, Japan focused more on Pakistan's nuclear ambitions at a time when Pakistan just devised the ‚ÄòLook East policy‚Äô with an aim to emulate the example of Japan and other East Asian countries to up-lift its economy after it was badly shattered during the war in Afghanistan. Pakistan‚Äôs Look East Policy Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto attended the funeral ceremony of Emperor Showa in February 1989. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu visited Pakistan on 2‚Äì3 May 1990, the first by a Japanese leader after the demise of the Cold War. He also wanted to mediate in the complicated issues between Pakistan and India as Japan became assertive after the end of the crisis in Afghanistan. Another notable diplomatic visit was undertaken by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan to Japan in November 1990 to participate in the coronation ceremony of the Emperor. Soon after becoming Prime Minister in November 1990, Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif decided to visit Japan in July 1991, introducing a new dimension in Pakistan‚Äôs foreign relations. The visit was, however, put off as a result of domestic upheaval. The visit was made on 16‚Äì19 December 1991, which was purely investment and business related. There was some controversy stirred up about Pakistan‚Äôs nuclear program and Japan also linked up its aid policy with Pakistan‚Äôs nuclear program and delayed its loan package until bilateral discussions were held on the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty (NPT). In fact, Japan followed the American lines on the nuclear issue after the withdrawal of Soviet forces in Afghanistan. Pakistan‚Äôs motorway project between Lahore and Islamabad also invited Japanese criticism as the project was awarded to a South Korean multinational, Daewoo in 1991. In an effort to consolidate further Pakistan-Japan ties, Prime Minister Benazir undertook an official visit to Japan in January 1996 to hold talks with her counterpart, Ryutaro Hashimoto, who eschewed from the complicated Pakistan-India issues especially after nuclear developments in South Asia. Japan wanted that both Pakistan and India should sign the anti-nuclear treaties. Following Pakistan‚Äôs nuclear detonation on 28 May 1998, Japan placed economic sanctions on Pakistan. 9/11 Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori visited Pakistan on 20‚Äì21 August 2000, which was a diplomatic breakthrough in Pakistan-Japan relations after the nuclear blast. The 9/11 events put additional security and economic pressure on Pakistan. The event helped converge Pakistan-Japan security linkages once again like the renewal of their cooperation during the Afghan war. Japan realized the importance of Pakistan to drive the Taliban out from Kabul when the International Conference on Reconstruction was held in Tokyo on 21‚Äì11 January 2002. President General Pervez Musharraf visited Japan on 12‚Äì15 March 2002. The visit was heavily loaded with the task related to combating terrorism in Afghanistan. Pakistan joined Japan‚Äôs Operation Enduring Freedom ‚Äì Maritime Interdiction Operation (OEF-MIO), aiming at combating terrorists in the Indian Ocean. Under the operation, Pakistan received fuel and fresh-water facility from Japanese vessels up to January 2010 besides the vessels of other 26 allied countries. The mission was scrapped as domestic differences rose high in Japan. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visited Pakistan on 30 April-1 May 2005. On the economic side, a major breakthrough made with regard to the resumption of Japanese new yen loan assistance to Pakistan. In response to Koizumi‚Äôs visit to Pakistan, Prime Minister Shoukat Aziz paid a visit to Japan on 8‚Äì11 August 2005. Therefore, Pakistan toed a complicated alliance with Japan from 1951 through to 2010 with many ups and downs and setbacks. Paradigm shift The Japanese so-called idea of the ‚Äòarc of security and freedom‚Äô floated in 2006 in cooperation with India and Australia, a leap forward to India in the shape of civil nuclear cooperation, and approving an India-specific concessions for the supply of nuclear plants and parts at the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) in 2008, have sent negative messages to Islamabad about the growing Indo-Japanese axis in the region. These developments introduced a paradigm shift in Pakistan-Japan relations.

The relationship is largely based on mutual trade and international political cooperation between the two countries. Pakistan is represented in Vietnam by its embassy in Hanoi,Embassy of Pakistan in Vietnam. and Vietnam also maintains an embassy in Islamabad.Vietnam Embassy in Pakistan During the Cold War, Pakistan (a non-aligned nation at the official level) maintained close ties with the United States-led Western Bloc to counter rival India's allegiance with the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the United States was involved in the Vietnam War against Soviet-backed North Vietnam (which emerged the victor of the war and its government superseded that of South Vietnam) while in the same time period, Pakistan had engaged in two major wars with neighbouring India in 1965 and 1971, the latter of which resulted in a devastating defeat for Pakistan and saw the emergence of an independent Bangladesh. Due to the fact that Pakistan was an ally with the United States and had begun to indirectly wage war against the Soviets in Afghanistan with heavy U.S.‚àíbacking, relations became strained between the two, with Pakistan closing its diplomatic mission in Vietnam in 1980 and Vietnam doing the same in 1984. However, relations greatly improved in the 2000s, and Pakistan reopened its embassy in Hanoi in October 2000. Vietnam also reopened its embassy in Islamabad and trade office in Karachi in December and November 2005, respectively. Relations between the two countries have continued to remain friendly, with Vietnam expressing an interest in increased economic and military cooperation with Pakistan. The heads of both nations have in recent times paid official visits to each other, with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf visiting Vietnam in May 2001 and Vietnamese President Tr·∫ßn ƒê·ª©c L∆∞∆°ng also paying an official visit to Pakistan in March 2004. Throughout the following decade, several visits were made by various Vietnamese and Pakistani ministries to each other. A major part of Pakistan's pursuit to enhance its relationship with Vietnam is outlined in Pakistan's \\"Vision East Asia\\" strategy. The emergence of such a strategy came as a result of Pakistan's desire to balance its relations with Vietnam and other East Asian / Southeast Asian states by making an effort to circumvent Pakistan's close relationship with China and Vietnam's growing relationship with India‚Äîthe former being a cause of concern for Vietnam due to its tense relationship with China and the latter being a cause of concern for Pakistan due to its rivalry and history of armed conflict with India. Vietnam provided US$50,000 worth of aid to Pakistan during the catastrophic 2010 floods.Vietnam assists Pakistan‚Äôs flood victims Trade links Trade between the two countries increased from US$10 million in 1999 to US$150 million in 2008.

This is due to the fact that Pakistan is a long-time close ally of China, the latter of which has tense relations with Vietnam. Developments in Vietnam's relations with Pakistan's rival India would prove to be a major problem for Pakistan. To circumvent this, Pakistan's \\"East Asia Vision Strategy\\" was projected in order to balance Pakistani-Vietnamese relations. Pakistanis in Vietnam Areas with a significant population of Pakistanis in Vietnam include the cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.  Vietnamese in Pakistan  Many factors contribute to the limited presence of Vietnamese communities and culture within Pakistan, most notably the latter's close relationship with China. Due to the absence of a strong historical connection and no close relations between the two countries (as well as the geographical distance between them), there continues to be a lack of interaction between the Vietnamese and Pakistani people (not taking into account the diasporas of both communities that are present in countries such as the United States and Canada). Despite this, it is not uncommon for the two communities to cross paths as Pakistan regularly hosts a respectable amount of Vietnamese tourists and small communities of Vietnamese people and cuisine can be found in Karachi.

Modern Egypt regards its founder as Muhammad Ali of Egypt while Muhammad Ali Jinnah is regarded as Pakistan's founder. History Egypt and the land of the Indus Valley (corresponding to modern Pakistan and Northwest India) have had political, commercial and cultural relations since antiquity, including long-lasting trade through the Red Sea-Indian Ocean maritime routes and conquest by the Persians, Alexander the Great and Arabs. The ancient Greeks commented that the people living along the Indus River were most similar to ancient Egyptians in appearance, with Arrian's Indica stating: > \\"The southern Indians resemble the Ethiopians a good deal, and, are black of > countenance, and their hair black also, only they are not as snub-nosed or > so woolly-haired as the Ethiopians; but the northern Indians are most like > the Egyptians in appearance.\\" Egypt and Pakistan established diplomatic relations in 1951.http://www.mfa.gov.eg/English/EgyptianForeignPolicy/EgyptianAsianRelation/BilateralRelations/Pakistan/Pages/History.aspx Arab Republic of Egypt Ministry of Foreign Affairs Retrieved March 8, 2011.

During war Egypt war with Israel, Pakistan Army sent weapons and fighter planes to Egypt. In 1974, President of Egypt Anwar Sadat visited Pakistan to attend the second OIC meeting held in Lahore, Punjab, and generally supported Pakistan's plans to become a nuclear power. But, however, the relations with Pakistan went sour when Pakistan began ties with the former Soviet Union. The worsening of relations of Pakistan with the United States further played a key role. Nonetheless, the relations were normal with Egypt after the removal of Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. In 1980s, President Hosni Mubarak and President Zia-ul-Haq further enhanced the relations; Egypt also played a vital role in Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War where Egypt widely provided manpower (see Afghan Arabs) and military equipment to Afghan mujahideen in their fight against the Soviets. In 1988‚Äì1990 and 1993‚Äì1996, Egypt's relations were soured with Pakistan Peoples Party formerly led by Benazir Bhutto who was generally close with the Soviet Union. 1995 Egyptian embassy bombing In 1995, a disastrous car bombing took place in Islamabad that targeted the Egyptian Embassy which the Egyptian Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for. A massive manhunt was initiated by ISI and all assailants were arrested in 2001 and were extradited to Egypt.

Some scholars partly attributed the development of popular history to the increase of writers-turned- historians such as Benson Lossing, David Pae, and Mary Botham Howitt, who wrote historical events \\"in good style\\" and, thus, more appealing to the public.  Popular historians  Some popular historians are without academic affiliation while others are academics, or former academics, who have (according to one writer) \\"become somehow abstracted from the academic arena, becoming cultural commentators.\\"De Groot, Jerome (2009), Consuming History: Historians and Heritage in Contemporary Popular Culture, Routledge, pg 15. Many worked as journalists, perhaps after taking an initial degree in history. Popular historians may become nationally renowned or best-selling authors and may or may not serve the interests of particular political viewpoints in their roles as \\"public historians\\". Many authors of \\"official histories\\" and \\"authorized biographies\\" would qualify as popular historians serving the interests of particular institutions or public figures. Popular historians aim to appear on the \\"general lists\\" of general publishers, rather than the university presses that have dominated academic publishing in recent years. Increasingly, popular historians have taken to television where they are able, often accompanying a series of documentaries with a tie-in book. Examples Academics = Recent examples of American popular historians with academic affiliations include Stephen E. Ambrose, Doris Kearns Goodwin and Pauline Maier. Recent examples of British popular historians who are also academics include Niall Ferguson, Mary Beard, Christopher Hibbert, Tom Holland, Simon Sebag Montefiore and Simon Schama, and ‚Äì from a previous generation ‚Äì Eric Hobsbawm, Paul Johnson, E. P. Thompson, A. J. P. Taylor (an early pioneer of history on television) and Christopher Hill. Much of Hugh Trevor-Roper's output was also directed at a popular audience. There is also Stella Tillyard and her work Aristocrats, which combined scholarly research with the popular method of presentation. = Non academics = American non-academics include Walter Lord, Bruce Catton, Dan Carlin, Shelby Foote, David McCullough, Daniel J. Boorstin, Max Cutler, Ron Cutler, and Barbara W. Tuchman. John Julius Norwich, Nirad Chaudhuri, Ramchandra Guha, Charles Allen, Rutger Bregman and Tariq Ali are popular British historians who have never been academics.

As the founder of Haunted Montreal, a company that researches ghost stories and offers haunted tours, King hires professional actors to lead the tours and publishes a new ghost story every month on the Haunted Montreal Blog. King is also a performance activist and experimental theatre artist who juggles acting, teaching, directing, dramaturgy, and theory to create dramatic projects that challenge systemic oppression. Known for his commitment to education and community, King assisted with the establishment of the Montreal Fringe Festival in 1991, is the author of Doing Theatre in Montreal and he set up the Montreal Infringement Festival in 2004. Background King holds a Masters of Fine Arts degree in Theatre Studies from the University of Calgary, a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Drama in Education from Concordia University, a Bachelor of Education from McGill University and a Diplome d‚Äô√âtudes Collegiales in Acting from John Abbott College. He is the author of Optative Theatre: A Critical Theory, and he facilitates various activist campaigns and drama classes in Montreal. He has been known to collaborate with other theatre activists internationally such as Augusto Boal, Andrew Boyd of the Billionaires for Bush, Reverend Billy (aka Bill Talen), Stephen Duncombe, Larry Bogad, Kathryn Blume, Kurt Schneiderman, Jason C. McLean, Gary St. Laurent, and many others. As the co-founder of the Optative Theatrical Laboratories (OTL) King strives to revitalise theatre as an agent for social change through experimental practice, critical theory, and sustained performance. The OTL designs interconnected theatrical campaigns such as Car Stories, that target instances of oppression, and employs a diversity of cutting-edge activist performance techniques: culture-jamming, Viral Theatre, Sousveillance Theatre, meme-warfare, Electronic Disturbance Theater, and Global Invisible Theatre, to name a few. In 2006, King took issue with racism inherent in what has been called \\"Canada‚Äôs First Play\\" ‚Äì the 1606 The Theatre of Neptune (Le Th√©√¢tre de Neptune) by Marc Lescarbot. OTL staged a counter-performance called \\"Sinking Neptune\\" in Annapolis Royal on the day of the \\"400th Theatre Anniversary\\" (November 14, 2006), in order to protest the original. In 2012, Donovan King was invited to the first World Fringe Congress in Edinburgh, Scotland, a gathering of Fringe administrators from round the world. Participating with a critical eye to corporate manipulation at Fringe Festivals, King published an article following the Congress called \\" World Fringe Congress to welcome infringement festival\\" that examines some of the more contentious issues, such unethical corporate sponsorship, pay-to-play fees and the trademarking of the word \\"Fringe\\" in Canada. King was invited back to the 2nd World Fringe Congress in 2014, again in Edinburgh, to deliver a workshop called \\"A World Fringe Philosophy\\" where he called on stakeholders to create policies at Fringe festivals to protect artists, spectators and communities from excessive corporate manipulation. The 3rd World Fringe Congress in 2016 was moved to Montreal and hosted by the Canadian Association of Fringe Festivals (CAFF), an organization that trademarked the word \\"Fringe\\" in Canada. King responded by moving the Montreal Infringement Festival from June to November, to coincide with the World Fringe Congress and also created the World Infringement Congress, held immediately after the original event, to examine issues being ignored, such as the \\"Fringe\\" trademark. This time, all potential World Fringe Congress delegates had to apply to participate. The applications of King along with other organizers at the Montreal and Buffalo Infringement Festivals were rejected without explanation, raising questions about exclusion and censorship at Canadian Fringe Festivals. Buffalo burlesque artist Cat McCarthy wrote an article in Buffalo's The Daily Public denouncing the decision and calling for a resolution to the conflict. King responded by inviting CAFF representatives to a Canadian Parliamentary-style debate at the World Infringement Congress regarding their trademark on the word \\"Fringe\\". More recently, King has been challenging systemic racism and discrimination in Montreal's tourism industry, specifically at Tourisme Montr√©al, the Institut de tourisme et d'h√¥tellerie du Qu√©bec, the A.P.G.T. (Association professionnelle des guides touristiques) and the City of Montreal, which has by-Law G-2 that prohibits tour guides outside a cartel of mostly white guides. https://ocpm.qc.ca/sites/ocpm.qc.ca/files/pdf/P100/8-41_donovan_king.pdf King has also been busy as a Director of the Montreal Irish Monument Park Foundation trying to preserve local Irish-Montreal heritage from erasure and desecration. http://www.optative.net/blog/an-open-letter-from-a-city-of- montreal-ambassador-to-mayor-valerie-plante-re-griffintown-rem-proposal-and- negative-international-reaction/ http://www.optative.net/blog/late-submission- for-public-consultation-bridge-bonaventure-sector/  Career  Partial directing = *Grease', JPPS, Montreal, 2006 *The Lysistrata Project, OTL, Montreal, 2003 *Miss Julie: a theatrical experiment into the psychosis of a. strindberg, University of Calgary, 2000 *Waiting For God, Nickel & Dime Productions, Calgary, 1999 *Call Me, Infinitheatre, Montr√©al, 1999 ** MECCA Award ‚Äì Best Production (semi-professional) *Godspell, Lewisham Operatic Society, London, England, 1996 *Mrs. Fieldstone‚Äôs Water Retention Problem, Greene Pressure Theatre, Montr√©al, 1995 *The Tinker‚Äôs Wedding, Wahoo Family Theatre, 1994 *The Misanthrope, Wahoo Family Theatre, 1993 *Tiger Mouth, Kindergarten Players, Montr√©al, 1993 = Filmography = *My Grad Date (2004) *Death by Latt√© (2004) *The Legend of Jackie Robinson (2003) = Partial performance theater = *La Grande Masquerade, Groupe-Conseil L‚ÄôEntracte, 2007‚Äìpresent *Les Fant√¥mes du Vieux-Montr√©al, GuidaTour, 2006‚Äìpresent *Sinking Neptune, OTL, Montreal, 2005‚Äì2006 *Car Stories, OTL, Montreal, 2001‚Äìpresent *Wal*Jam, OTL, Montreal, 2003 *Quartier des contre-Spectacles, OTL/Place des Arts, Montreal, 2003 *Stones Scandal, Galway Arts Festival, Ireland, 2001 *FJOLZ!, Elvagel Performance Festival, Elsinore, Denmark, 2001 *CorporACT, Auckland, New Zealand, 1997‚Äì1998 *Monsterworld Inc., Chateau Greystoke, Montr√©al, 1994 = Partial traditional theater = *The Captives, Knebworth House, England *Ever After, Out Of Our Heads & One Yellow Rabbit, Calgary *The Tempest, Stage 2 Productions, Auckland, New Zealand *Anne of Green Gables, Montreal Concordia Players & ACT, Hong Kong *Manhattan, Je Vous Dis, Theatre 21st Century, Montr√©al *Who Ran Off With Dr. Seuss?, Wahoo Family Theatre Co., Montr√©al Fringe Fest. *The Misadventures‚Ä¶., Concordia University Theatre Department *Rising of the Moon, Wahoo Family Theatre Co., Montr√©al *St. George & the Dragon, Christmas Mummering Company, Montr√©al *L‚ÄôAvare (The Miser)', Cleante Th√© √† l‚Äô√¢tre, Montr√©al Fringe Festival = Bibliography = *A Dramaturgical Toolbox for Sinking Neptune, Optative Free Press, 2005 *Optative Theatre: a critical theory for challenging Oppression and Spectacle, University of Calgary, 2004 *The Warders Bible, Vardon PLC, London, 1997 *Strategies to enhance live entertainments at London and York Dungeons, Vardon PLC, London, 1996 *Doing Theatre in Montreal, Quebec Drama Federation, 1995  References External links * Donovan King at the Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia] * Optative Theatrical Laboratories official website * Infringement Festival official website * Optative Theatrical Laboratories press links * Optative Theatre: A Critical Theory for challenging Spectacle and Oppression * Sinking Neptune Category:Canadian male stage actors Category:Anglophone Quebec people Category:Quebec people of Irish descent Category:Fringe theatre Category:Living people Category:1972 births Category:University of Calgary alumni Category:Concordia University alumni Category:McGill University alumni Category:Male actors from Montreal ","title":"Donovan King"},{"id":"20959155","text":"Milan Piroƒáanac (; 7 January 1837 ‚Äì 1 March 1897) was a Serbian jurist, politician, Prime Minister and the leader and founder of the Progressive Party.  Early life  Milan Nedeljkoviƒá was born in 1837 in Jagodina. His father Stevan Nedeljkoviƒá, born in Pirot (hence his byname), was a Revolutionary veteran and srez chief of Knja≈æevac. His mother Milica, from the Jagodina okrug, was earlier married to vojvoda Pavle Cukiƒá. He finished primary school in Jagodina, gymnasium in Kragujevac and Belgrade. He continued studies in law at the Belgrade Lyceum (1854‚Äì56), after which he at the end of 1856 moved to Paris where he finished the Law University in 1860. In 1861 he studied at Heidelberg, until returning to Belgrade at the end of 1861. He adopted the name Piroƒáanac during his school years.  Politics  Serbian politician Ilija Gara≈°anin recruited Piroƒáanac into the Foreign Ministry of Serbia. After Serbia and Montenegro concluded an alliance in 1866, brokered by Prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá and Prince Nikola I Petroviƒá-Njego≈° so that the two Serb principalities could jointly fight the Ottoman Empire, Piroƒáanac spent several months in Cetinje, as a political representative of Serbia, serving, in addition, as a secretary to Prince Nikola. He began a career as a judge in 1868 and was posted at the Court of Cassation in 1872. Piroƒáanac was elected Minister of Foreign Affairs in the conservative-liberal alliance cabinet led by Jovan Marinoviƒá (November 25, 1874 to January 22, 1875). After the end of his short ministerial term he returned to the Court of Cassation. Being a prominent member of the younger Western-educated Serbian conservatives, Piroƒáanac was the founder of the Progressive Party in 1880, gathered around the journal Videlo (Daylight), which propagated loyalty to the Crown and ‚Äúlaw, freedom and progress‚Äù. Invited by Prince Milan Obrenoviƒá to form a government, Piroƒáanac formed a Progressive cabinet on October 19, 1880, that during its three years in office introduced significant reforms into Serbian society. Under his government Serbia concluded a commercial treaty with Austria-Hungary and started the strategically important construction of a railway (Belgrade- Ni≈° and Ni≈°-Pirot) in order to link Serbia with both Central Europe and Ottoman Turkey. The Education Minister in his government, Stojan Novakoviƒá, made primary school compulsory and modernized school curricula, putting emphasis on liberal and positivist subjects instead of on classical Latin- based education. Prince Milan, together with his Foreign Minister ƒåedomilj Mijatoviƒá, formalized his relations with Vienna, by preparing and signing the \\"Secret Convention\\" in 1881, a document unknown both to the Serbian parliament and the wider public, that put Serbian foreign policy under Austrian tutelage. This was a major point of disagreement between the Prince and his Prime Minister, and in order to avoid any further lack of loyalty from ƒåedomilj Mijatoviƒá, Piroƒáanac took the office of Foreign Minister to himself, leaving Mijatoviƒá solely the post of finance minister. Nevertheless, Mijatoviƒá provoked another scandal, during the bankruptcy of l‚ÄôUnion G√©n√©rale from Paris, by granting them consent to realize a set of state bonds for the railway loan. In order to avoid a financial catastrophe, both Prince Milan and Prime Minister Piroƒáanac asked for the support of Austria-Hungary, having in mind both the survival of the Progressive party government and the need to avoid any radical change of foreign-policy orientation (i.e. towards Russia). Austrian mediation turned to be quite helpful and Prime Minister Piroƒáanac, in order to appease the situation, instead of an extensive financial report, presented to the National Assembly a draft law on the proclamation of the Kingdom of Serbia, with Prince Milan Obrenoviƒá as its new King (the first Serbian king since the Middle Ages), a proposal which was greeted with joy and approval by the deputies. Acceptance of this proposal on 22 February 22 (old style), strengthened, at least for a while, the position of the Piroƒáanac cabinet. The Austro-Hungarian occupation of the Bosnia Vilayet and fears of its annexation presented a new challenge. Piroƒáanac threatened to resign, while in addition negative comments in the Serbian press, as well as Serb press outside Serbia, contributed to the decision in Vienna to postpone the plans for the annexation of Bosnia in 1883. Facing one crisis after another, Prime Minister Piroƒáanac, lacking the support of Prince, later King, Milan, had no room left to prepare a new, more liberal constitution that would replace the old one of 1869. Piroƒáanac, as most other Progressives, was in favour of a two chamber system, advocating the upper chamber of Parliament as an obstacle against populism (‚Äúdespotism of the masses‚Äù), ascribed mostly to the then-opposition National Radical Party of Nikola Pa≈°iƒá. The upper chamber, consisting of intellectuals appointed by the King would, as he proposed, control the irresponsible and uneducated peasant, mostly Radical, deputies. The Piroƒáanac government did manage to, however, pass a set of extremely important democratic Western-inspired laws in that would provide the political framework for future democratic development: the law on judicial independence (February 9, 1881), the law on the freedom of the press (March 28, 1881), on political association and organization (April 1, 1881), as well as the law on creating a standing army (January 3, 1883). With other laws promulgated, in particular on free elections, local autonomy and taxation, the Piroƒáanac government made possible the accelerated modernization and Europenisation of the predominantly patriarchal society of Serbia, therefore being a crucial stage of the country's development, both economic and political.  Resignation and last years  Piroƒáanac resigned on September 21, 1883 after his party was defeated at the general election held the same month. Piroƒáanac remained the party leader until 1886. He resigned from the party leadership of the Progressive party and political life in general after a long quarrel with his deputy Milutin Gara≈°anin over the defeat in the war against Bulgaria the previous year (1885). Piroƒáanac afterwards returned to practicing law and represented foreign companies in Belgrade. His old mansion in Belgrade, at Francuska street no. 7, is now the seat of the Writer's Union of Serbia.

Ties between the two countries are premised upon religious and historical affinity. This is emphasized by the absence of any recurring dispute although there is much potential to augment the level of ties. A number of framework agreements have been concluded between Pakistan and Tunisia in the spheres of trade, tourism, culture, information and industries. However, these have been conspicuous for remaining dormant or being scarcely reviewed at best. Diplomatic Missions Diplomatic relations between both states were established in 1957. Pakistan opened its embassy in Tunis in 1958 at the Charges d' Affaires level which was later upgraded to that of Ambassador/Plenipotentiary in 1964. Tunisia introduced its embassy in Islamabad in 1980. History Pakistan supported Tunisia during its struggle for independence. Members of that generation who are still living fondly recall Pakistan's steadfastness for backing Tunisia's liberation movement. Between 1948 and 1954, Pakistan's first Foreign Minister, Sir Zafarullah Khan, represented Pakistan at the United Nations Security Council where he vociferously advocated for Tunisian freedom from colonial rule. So were the contributions of renowned writer and diplomat, Patras Bokhari, lauded by the Tunisian government for his defence of Tunisian independence. During his tenure as Pakistan's Permanent Representative at the United Nations from 1951‚Äì1954, he delivered an epic speech on the floor of the Security Council for which a road was named after him by Tunisia right after its independence in 1956. For its part, Tunisia has backed Pakistan in the Kashmir conflict but insomuch that it does not antagonize India, with whom it has fostered significant trade relations. Tunisia lies at the confluence of the Euro-Mediterranean strip, North Africa and the Middle East, whereas Pakistan's proximity to the Gulf and the Far East could pay large dividends in value-added trade and when exploring emerging markets. Bilateral Ties There exists also a long tradition of collaboration between the two countries in international organizations particularly at the United Nations, the OIC and NAM in terms of lending support to each other's stance and candidatures .Embassy of Tunisia in Pakistan, Republic of Tunisia Ministry of Foreign Affairs Pakistan backed Tunisia on the issue of its complete control over Bizerte which the French colonial rulers eventually evacuated in 1960. In the context of bilateral interaction at VVIP level, Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto visited in January 1972. while Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto; and, Nawaz Sharif - also in his capacity as Prime Minister - toured Tunisia in May 1990 and February 1991 respectively. The last bilateral VVIP tour occurred when Pakistani President, Pervez Musharraf, was invited to Tunisia in July 2003. On the other hand, no VVIP tour has materialized from Tunisia although leaders of both nations interact at multilateral fora. Tunisian Foreign Minister Habib Chatty represented his country at the Second OIC Summit which was organized in Lahore in February 1974. Small diasporas totalling hardly 100 individuals is a prominent aspect taken for both countries combined. In addition, student exchange is non-existent; nevertheless, madrassa-affiliated participants and tablighi missionaries visit Pakistan for annual jamaats. At this current juncture and in keeping with contemporary times, the general state of ties can be reconfigured to focus chiefly on trade and security. In 2005, when a deadly Earthquake struck the Muzaffarabad region of Pakistan, Tunisia sent a C-130 carrying 14 tons of relief supplies, including food, blankets and medical supplies to Pakistan.International response to the 2005 Kashmir earthquake In 2011 and 2014, Tunisia played host to Pakistani refugees fleeing the violence in neighboring Libya. This gesture has become a prominent feature of bilateral ties. A friendship group exists between Pakistan's National Assembly and Tunisia's Assembly of People's Representatives. Upon the invitation of Pakistan's Jamaat-i-Islami, Ennahdha members visited Pakistan in 2014. On 27 October 2015, Pakistan feted the Tunisian Envoy in Islamabad in recognition of 4 Tunisian civil society organizations being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. There have been proposals from both nations that Islamabad & Tunis and Karachi & Sfax be designated as twin cities. A visa abolition agreement was inked in 2010 which is restricted to diplomatic and official passport holders. In terms of collaboration at the United Nations, both countries occasionally support each other's candidatures at several UN-affiliated agencies. This is premised on the principle of reciprocity and in the recent past, this has been witnessed by mutual backing or withdrawal from the electoral race in favour of the other during rounds of voting. Bilateral Political Consultations Two sessions of this bilateral mechanism have been organized thus far, the last one in September 2012 during the 8th Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC) in Islamabad. Economic Nexus Mutual trade is incommensurate with the equation being enjoyed by the two countries and this has been echoed by the leadership of Tunisia and Pakistan. Trade statistics reveal approximately US$33 million although this could witness a surge once a preferential trade agreement is signed between both countries. Primary goods exchanged in the normal course of trade are textiles, cotton yarn, rice, olives, used garments especially denim, surgical instruments, ceramics, edible oil, phosphates, machinery components. Nevertheless, the share of output in each other's imports is hardly 1%. The Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC) is a mechanism established in February 1982 whereby state ministers representing each country outline the general mode of cooperation and focus on promoting ties in the economic sphere. Going by the latest count, the 7th JMC session was organized in Tunis from 4‚Äì6 May 2010 and was signalled by the signing of four important agreements and memorandum of understanding. Similarly, the 8th chapter was held in Islamabad on 19 and 20 September 2012 wherein 4 agreements were also concluded. It is understood that the 9th session is slated to be organized in 2017, this time in Tunis. The Joint Business Council (JBC) was created in May 2010 to oversee and monitor the activities of the relevant government and private sector agencies in the context of economic ties. At this juncture, the inaugural session of the JBC is yet to occur. The opening meeting of the Joint Working Group (JWG) on textiles was organized in June 2009 in Tunis which was very beneficial for both sides in comprehending the realities of the sector in each country. Pakistan and Tunisia jointly believe that the textile sector is at the cutting edge of bilateral relations. Avenues of cooperation for augmenting trade can be underscored by agrifood technology & implements, software, machinery components, completed articles of clothing, textile weaving & spinning, synthetic fibres, accessories, marble & onyx decorations, olives, dates, sports ware, leather garments & footwear, surgical instruments, rice and spices. Pakistan can tap into Tunisia's reexport potential, citing its access to the European and African markets. In definite terms, this scenario could convert into a pool of approximately 800 million people. For its part, Tunisia can put the China-Pakistan FTA into good use and market its goods there. In the context of interaction between national and regional chambers of commerce, agreements exist between the Islamabad and Tunis Chambers of Commerce & Industry, as well as between the Karachi and Sialkot chambers respectively and Sfax chamber. About 25 treaties, protocols and MoUs of various nature have been signed, with the vast majority needing review and practical application in order to translate into tangible results. Trade delegations from Pakistan visited in 2003, 2006 & 2012\\\\. On the other hand, Tunisian entrepreneurs have been participating only in editions of EXPO and TEXPO PAKISTAN that has culminated in marginal improvement in trade. Deliberations over a Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) are ensuing with progress expected in 2016. Educational Research & Exchanges Collaboration between universities is minimal. In 2008, faculty members of 2 Pakistani educational institutions visited Tunisia. However, student exchange is non-existent, perhaps given the difference in the medium of instruction being used in either country - Pakistan utilises English while in Tunisia it is primarily Arabic and French. Nevertheless, a couple of accords have been signed between Tunisia's Ezzeitouna University and Pakistan's International Islamic University (2012) as well as the University of Tunis al-Manar and COMSATS Institute of Information Technology (2015), also known by its acronym CIIT, in Pakistan. In 1998, Pakistani scholars obtained their doctorates in Islamic Fiqh from Tunisia whereas a few Tunisian students have been imparted religious education at Pakistani madrassas. In addition, a MoU for Cooperation between the Foreign Service Academy of Pakistan and Tunisia‚Äôs Diplomatic Training Institute (2002) exists. Interaction here is also quite limited. Cultural Links Tunisia's national television network had extended an invitation to Sufi singers from Pakistan in 2012 to perform during the month of Ramadan. Consequently, a troupe of Sufi singers led by Fakir Jamaluddin was invited. The troupe rendered performances not only on television but also at five other locations including the capital Tunis. The legendary Nusrat Fateh Ali enthralled fans when he participated at the 1994 Carthage International Music Festival in Tunis. The popular and evergreen singer Abida Parveen also performed at the festival. On a more recent note in July 2015, renowned Qawwal Faiz Ali Faiz attended the same event as part of a duet. Potential exists for the introduction of Pakistani soap operas on Tunisian television networks, of course, dubbed in the local language. In the context of landmarks, Pakistan Street and Islamabad Street have been designated by the Tunisian government as a reminder of the bilateral goodwill prevalent between the two countries. Ties based on sports are negligible and are confined to international events such as the Olympics or tennis tournaments. Defence Collaboration The sphere of defence cooperation is currently punctuated by study tours undertaken by Pakistan's National Defence University (NDU) as well as naval delegations, whereas, no visit has yet transpired from Tunisia. In August 1996 and May 2005, vessels belonging to Pakistan Navy made port calls in Tunis. Since 2012, training of military personnel and exchange of experiences has been the focus of policy makers in both nations. In addition, Tunisia has evinced interest in Pakistani-made small arms, combat/protection gear and ammunition. Given the mutual experience with the fight against terrorism, prospects exist for cooperation in security & counter-terrorism. Parliamentary Friendship Groups Respective parliamentary friendship groups have been created in each country to ensure bilateral interaction between the elected representatives. The last visits/exchanges were recorded in: *1977= Pakistani parliamentarians in Tunisia *1991= Tunisian parliamentarians in Pakistan Pakistan-Tunisia Friendship Association This forum has been in existence since the mid-70s and is mandated with increasing bilateral goodwill and affinity through cultural, trade and social interaction.

Trade between the two countries is generally increasing with time. History Embassy of Pakistan in Paris The foreign relations between Pakistan and France were first established on 31 July 1951 when both countries agreed to open embassy services in each countries. France was one of the first non-Muslim state to recognize Pakistan, Iran was the first, opening its embassy about 2 months after Pakistani independence On August 1960, a farewell trade treaty was signed; followed by import-export treaty that was concluded October 1966. During the Cold war, France considered Pakistan as \\"state deserving attention\\", and had been a major foreign supplier of Pakistan Armed Forces. After the Cold war, France's foreign policy has been noted for decades for its special Gaullist flavour, which was not much altered under the long Presidency of socialist Fran√ßois Mitterrand (1981-1995). French Presidents visited India more often than Pakistan, and Paris has never met the expectations of Islamabad regarding the U.N. resolutions on Kashmir. The relations again suffered many set back in 1998-99 when Paris saw the Kargil episode as a dangerous Pakistan initiative, considering the new nuclearised regional context. Though, France has always been to encourage dialogue between India and Pakistan, without offering mediation in such an intricate issue. There was some impatience in Paris decision-makers circles when the Line of Control was crossed above Kargil in an obviously well prepared operation. =Military and strategic cooperation= Since 1967, France had been an important partner, particularly for PAF and the Navy. In 1967, France sold first batch of its Mirage fighters as well as sold the submarine technology to Pakistan. The PAF bought second-hand batch of Mirage fighters in 1990; followed by a contract signing in 1996 for the acquisition of 40 reconnaissance aircraft. The PAF is the largest customer of France's aerospace industry with numbers of fighter and civilian aircraft having been sold to Pakistan since 1967 till the 2000s. The Navy has also an established defence connection with France, the best known purchasing of Daphn√© class submarine and the submarine technology transfer of the Agost class which was signed in 1994. In 2009, France agreed to provide financial capital to expand the use of nuclear power in Pakistan. While, the officials at Islamabad termed it as \\"significant move\\", the Foreign service office maintained that: \\"France has agreed to transfer civilian nuclear technology to Pakistan.\\" The French Foreign ministry had confirmed that the country was ready, within the framework of its international agreements, to \\"co-operate with Pakistan\\" in the field of nuclear safety. \\"This is so the Pakistan's programme can develop in the best conditions of safety and security\\", the French foreign officials added to APP. After the agreement, France maintained that \\"this is the beginning of a civil nuclear partnership and the cooperation will be limited to nuclear safety.\\" =Trade and Economics relations= The first trade agreement was signed in 1966, and Pakistan is currently ranked as 65th import partner of France. The bilateral trade was reached to US$313 million in 2009.

The name refers to the Greek ambassadors for whom the platform was originally built after the Roman Republic conquered Greece. Placed at the southwest end of the Comitium, the platform was the designated spot for all representatives of foreign nations and dignitaries from the republic and empire's domain. Visiting outsiders were not permitted within the Senate House or Curia and instead may have stood on this platform while waiting to meet with senators or to hear orations from the Rostra to its east side. Although one scholar has disputed this interpretation and argues that it may have served as a viewing platform for entertainment.  Overview  The Graecostasis was, as Niebuhr remarks, like privileged seats in the hall of a parliamentary assembly. The Stationes Municipiorum, of which Pliny speaks, appear to have been places allotted to municipals for the same purpose. When the sun was seen from the Curia coming out between the Rostra and the Graecostasis, it was mid-day; and an accensus of the consul announced the time with a clear loud voice. Much of the history of the structure has been effected in the same way as other known similar monuments. When the orators on the Rostra faced north towards the Curia to speak the Graecostatsis was aligned along a hemicircle believed to have been the outer footprint of the Comitium amphitheater removed when a moratorium against permanent theatre was placed on the city. It is believed this may have been from riots stirred up by political speeches on the Rostra or a political theatrical performance or show. While there have been excavations of the site, the exact location remains unclear. Several layers of rubble in the Comitium show constant changes within a small period of time, which raised the level of the space and, consequently the location of the platform. Many historians believe that the Rostra maintained its location in the Comitium during varied restorations and construction as that platform was a permanent fixture of Roman politics and held in an honored and elevated status, while the Graecostasis was presumed to be a simple wooden structure. A theory has been put forth that the finale phase of the structure was constructed of stone and concrete and is visible in the topmost layer directly beneath the contemporary ground level next to the remains of the original Rostra before it was moved by Julius Caesar. Due in part to confusion over a similarly named structure nearby and the Roman use of many Greek traditions the location has been debated; however contemporary writings from the time do distinguish two separate structures of which the Graecostadium is one, but much larger and a complete architectural building. Its use was for training and exercise and is the ancient equivalent to a large, complicated gymnasium.  Surrounding area  Near the Graecostasis and Rostra was an ancient shrine called the Vulcanal. It and the Lapis Niger represent the oldest parts of the Comitium space. The altar, originally a shrine to the god Vulcan, became the first suggestum or speakers platform, similar in nature to the Rostra and was probably first used for oration by the kings of Rome. The environs of the Vulcanal, Rostra and the Graecostasis is also the site of several historic monuments as well as two trees supposedly planted by Romulus. A cypress and a lotus tree stood close to these structures; the age and size of these trees were so great that it was recorded that their roots had begun to undermine the ground beneath the Forum of Caesar.  History  The original location of the Comitium was on a shelf like slope of the Capitoline Hill. This shelf was wider due to the depression between two summits of the hill and located directly in front of the Tabularium. This is the location of a terrace where the three original races met on neutral ground outside the fortifications of their individual settlements and tribes and provided a location for the first buildings of mutual government. When the Tiber flooded, water would cover the Forum and Comitium stalling all business for days on end. It was for this reason that many of the original buildings were placed upon higher ground and the lower level was reserved for assemblies, elections and public shows, making it necessary to be free from major permanent obstructions. It is believed that both the original Rostra and Graecostasis were just such non-permanent structures, being simple raised, wooden tribunals that could be assembled, disassembled and moved where needed.

The measure would have required that when an unemancipated minor 15 years and older sought an abortion, the medical provider must first give written notice to a parent of the minor, by certified mail, at least 48 hours prior to providing the abortion. It was rejected by voters, with only 45 percent favoring it. Background Current Oregon law provides that a minor 15 years or older may consent to and obtain medical treatment, including abortion, without parent notification, but also that a physician may notify parent without the minor's consent. Minors 14 years or younger on the other hand must obtain parental consent before obtaining treatment. If Measure 43 had passed, it would have required that a provider notify an unemancipated minor's parent 48 hours before performing abortion. Notification meant written notice to parent by certified mail at the parent's residence. Exceptions to notice requirement for documented would be allowed for medical emergencies. This exception did not include cases of rape or incest. Unemancipated minor could apply for administrative hearing requesting abortion without notice to parent. The hearing would be confidential, open only to minor, counsel, witnesses, judge. Under the measure failure to notify parent would subject provider to civil liability to parent. In addition physicians would face administrative sanctions, license suspension, or revocation. Description of the Measure Ballot Measure 43 required that when an unemancipated minor 15 years and older seeks an abortion, the medical provider must first give written notice to a parent of the minor, by certified mail, at least 48 hours prior to providing the abortion. Ballot Measure 43 allowed for an exception to the notice requirement 1) if the parent or guardian is given notice in person, or 2) in the event of a medical emergency which is documented in the minor's medical file, or 3) if the minor obtains authorization from the Department of Human Services or a court.

In 2006, he published an article identifying 19 of the 28 former communist countries as \\"successful\\" transitions with a number of similarities He has since written more pessimistically about the progress of democratization in the former Soviet bloc, however, and urged stronger U.S. interest In 2008 he wrote: \\"Long before the Russians entered Georgia, democracy was clearly on the retreat in postcommunist Europe and Eurasia, as was the leverage of both the United States and the democratic European powers.\\"Adrian A.

The aim was to reduce nitrogen effluent from the water treatment systems during the tanning of leather. Previously tanneries in Europe had only been able to reduce nitrogen in the water by up to a maximum of 30%. The \\"Tanwater\\" project aimed at reducing nitrogen waste by up to 80% and finally was able to achieve 89% nitrogen-waste reduction in the water. This was a major breakthrough for the tanning industry because nitrogen is a pollutant of ground water. Elmo tannery received a grant for the project from LIFE (The Financial Instrument for the Environment). LIFE finances environmental projects in the European Union. Elmo tannery, although producing leather predominantly for the car industry (upholstery leather), also produces leather for handbags and footwear. Since Elmo started this project there have been a number of tanneries that have followed in its steps of improving their water treatment systems in Sweden and Norway.

Thomas Howell. Its title and premise are similar to those of the 2008 remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still (of which The Day the Earth Stopped is a mockbuster) but the film's plot also incorporates elements from other science- fiction films involving aliens, such as Transformers, Independence Day and Earth vs. the Flying Saucers. The film is Howell's second Asylum film in which he was attached as director, the first being War of the Worlds 2: The Next Wave. The film stars director C. Thomas Howell as the protagonist, soldier Josh Myron, who witnesses the arrival of giant alien robots that threaten to destroy the Earth unless they are shown the value of human existence. Myron becomes a fugitive to protect the aliens' messenger Skye (Sinead McCafferty) and tries to meet her demands, while the aliens begin to tilt the Earth on its axis and all military defense is defeated. Plot The film centers on soldier Josh Myron, as six hundred and sixty six gigantic extraterrestrial robots land on Earth. As the robots are landing, two alien humanoids also arrive, one male and one female. Both are eventually captured by the military who try to communicate with them. Eventually, the female starts talking to Myron and reveals that she can read his mind along with others. Myron is told that the entire human race is a threat to the rest of the galaxy and unless she is shown the value of humanity by sunset, the planet will be destroyed. Attempts to communicate with the robots fail as they vaporize anyone that tries to attack them or even fires a rifle to get their attention. An effort is made to destroy the robots using Sidewinder Missiles, delivered by YF-22s. The missiles are ineffective and the attacking planes are destroyed. The woman, who reveals that her name in its closest English translation is Skye, also displays the ability to harness surrounding energy to protect herself. However, after using that, the military officer in charge of the \\"mission\\" starts to use a Taser on Skye, leading to Myron violently intervening and being thrown off the project. He goes AWOL but, as he is driving away, he is telepathically contacted by Skye and he returns to rescue her. The effort proves successful and starts a citywide search for him and Skye. The male alien also manages to escape as the robots begin a systemic attack on the planet, first with an EMP (which aids in Josh rescuing Skye). It is also discovered that the robots are slowing down the Earth's core and stopping the planet's rotation. An effort is made to destroy one of the robots with a nuclear explosion, sacrificing 9000 inhabitants of a small island. When the bomb goes off, the machine emerges unharmed and Skye feels the pain of the people dying and almost passes out. Josh takes the time to comfort Skye before the military finds them again. Myron and Skye come across a married couple and put the wife in the back of a 4x4, as she is in labour. The husband delivers the child but is unaware of a complication until he realizes that his wife has stopped breathing. Myron hands the infant to Skye and tells her that if she wants to know the value of humanity, \\"you're staring at it\\". Myron and the husband try to revive the wife but are unsuccessful. Myron realizes that the wife is dead and stops applying CPR. Skye, despite her earlier statement that she would not get involved, uses her powers to bring the wife back to life. Skye, now convinced of the value of humanity, needs to get to the closest robot to return home and end the invasion, but, before they can get to the robot, Skye is shot by the military. Skye and Myron are taken back to the base where Skye is treated for the injury, as the planet's rotation stops and a major global earthquake hits. The commander realizes that Myron was right and helps Myron move Skye to a vehicle. As they leave, they are chased by the psychologist, who is convinced that keeping Skye will prevent the robots from attacking further. At the feet of the robot, Myron is shot by the psychologist; the robot vaporizes him. The alien male arrives, sees both Skye and Myron possibly dead and uses his own powers to revive both. Skye, in gratitude, hugs Myron before both of the aliens are beamed aboard. The invasion ends and the robots depart, leaving the planet intact but with major damage. Cast * C.

Armstrong patented a method for generating frequency modulation of radio signals.U.S. Patent 1,941,068 The Armstrong method generates a double sideband suppressed carrier signal, phase shifts this signal, and then reinserts the carrier to produce a frequency modulated signal. Frequency modulation generates high quality audio and greatly reduces the amount of noise on the channel when compared with amplitude modulation. Early broadcasters used amplitude modulation because it was easier to generate than frequency modulation and because the receivers were simpler to make. The electronics theory indicated that a frequency modulated signal would have infinite bandwidth; for an amplitude modulated signal, the bandwidth is approximately twice the highest modulating frequency. Armstrong realized that while a frequency modulated signal would have an infinite bandwidth, only the first few sets of sidebands would be significant; the rest could be ignored.The ARRL Handbook for Radio Communication, American Radio Relay League, 2008, p. 9.30 An amplitude modulated voice channel bandwidth would be approximately 6 kilohertz; a common frequency modulated voice channel bandwidth could be 15 kilohertz.  How it works  The Armstrong method begins by generating a carrier signal at a very low frequency, say 500 kilohertz. This frequency is below the AM broadcast band and much below the current FM broadcast band of 88 to 108 megahertz. This carrier signal is applied to two stages in the transmitter: a balanced modulator and a mixer. To understand how a balanced modulator works it is necessary to understand amplitude modulation and how it works. Most people describe amplitude modulation as a method of changing the strength of the carrier (amplitude) in sync with the modulating audio. This is true, the power output does change with modulation, but it changes because any AM modulator generates two sidebands, one above and one below the carrier. As power goes into these sidebands, the power output increases. The amplitude modulated signal, then, consists of a constant strength carrier and two sidebands. The sidebands carry the information and the carrier just goes along for the ride. The carrier can be removed at the transmitter and reinserted at the receiver to allow the transmitter to put all the power in the sidebands. A frequency modulator also generates sidebands, but instead of one sideband on each side of the carrier, it generates many sidebands on each side of the carrier. The FM bandwidth is wider because of the many sidebands. The power output from an FM transmitter is constant with modulation, so as power goes into the sidebands, the carrier power is reduced. A balanced modulator mixes the audio signal and the radio frequency carrier, but suppresses the carrier, leaving only the sidebands. The output from the balanced modulator is a double sideband suppressed carrier signal and it contains all the information that the AM signal has, but without the carrier. It is possible to generate an AM signal by taking the output from the balanced modulator and reinserting the carrier.Hayward, Campbell, and Larkin. Experimental Methods in RF Design, American Radio Relay League, 2003, p. 9.49 In the Armstrong method, the audio signal and the radio frequency carrier signal are applied to the balanced modulator to generate a double sideband suppressed carrier signal. The phase of this output signal is then shifted 90 degrees with respect to the original carrier. The balanced modulator output can either lead or lag the carrier's phase. The double sideband signal and the original carrier signal are then applied to the mixer, and the original carrier‚Äî90 degrees out of phase‚Äîis reinserted. The output from the mixer is a frequency modulated signal. Reinserting the carrier without the phase shift produces an AM signal. Reinserting the carrier with the 90 degree phase shift produces a PM signal. If the intelligence is integrated before being applied to the resulting phase modulator, this equivalent to a FM signal. One of the problems with the Armstrong method is that the frequency deviation‚Äîthe amount of modulation‚Äîmust be kept small to minimize distortion.U.S. Patent 1,941,068 The maximum deviation is a fraction of 1 kilohertz, but FM broadcast requires 75 kilohertz deviation and a typical FM voice channel deviation is 5 kilohertz. To solve this problem, Armstrong multiplied the signal many times to a higher frequency to obtain the necessary deviation. For example, to generate an FM signal with 5 kilohertz deviation at 146.94 megahertz, the transmitter would generate a signal at 6.1225 megahertz with only 0.2 kilohertz deviation, and then multiply the signal 24 times.  Legacy  The Armstrong method is no longer used commercially. Frequency modulation is most commonly generated at the operating frequency with the required deviation. While the system was being used in the 1930s and 1940s it provided a high quality FM audio signal  References  Category:Radio modulation modes Category:Radio technology Category:Broadcast engineering ","title":"Armstrong phase modulator"},{"id":"20959698","text":"Hydnellum aurantiacum is an inedible fungus, commonly known as the orange spine or orange Hydnellum for its reddish orange or rusty red colored fruit bodies. Like other tooth fungi, it bears a layer of spines rather than gills on the underside of the cap. Due to substantial declines in sightings, this species is listed as critically endangered in the United Kingdom. Taxonomy Hydnellum aurantiacum was first described by the German naturalist August Batsch in 1789, with the name Hydnum suberosum var. aurantiacum. It was given its current scientific name by Petter Karsten, who transferred it to Hydnellum in 1879. Hydnellum aurantiacum has acquired several synonyms in its taxonomic history, including Hydnum stohlii, published by Gottlob Ludwig Rabenhorst in 1873, and Hydnellum complectipes, published by Hall in 1972. Additional synonyms resulting from generic transfers include Hydnum aurantiacum (Johannes Baptista von Albertini and Lewis David de Schweinitz, 1825); Calodon aurantiacus (Karsten, 1881); and Phaeodon aurantiacus (Joseph Schr√∂ter, 1888). The specific epithet aurantiacum is derived from the Latin for \\"orange\\". Common names for the fungus include \\"orange spine\\", \\"orange corky spine fungus\\", and the British Mycological Society approved English name \\"orange Hydnellum\\". Description Young fruit body Fruitbodies are shallowly funnel- shaped (infundibuliform), and up to 15 cm in diameter. The upper surface is orange or orange-brown in the centre, with a lighter margin. It may be velvety or tomentose when young, but will become wrinkled or lumpy in age. The flesh is tough and woody, pale to dark orange-brown in color, without any distinctive odor but a bitter or mealy taste. The teeth are short (up to 5 mm long), white, but the tips gradually turn brown with age. The stipe is up to 4 cm long and 0.5‚Äì2 cm thick, orange to dark brown in color, with a velvety surface. The spore print is brown. This species is inedible, due to the toughness of the flesh. Basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are between 35‚Äì46 by 8‚Äì11 ¬µm, club-shaped (clavate), without clamp connections, and four-spored. The sterigmata (extensions of the basidia bearing spores) may be up to 6 ¬µm long. Basidiospores are roughly spherical in shape, with rough warty outgrowths (tubercles), nonamyloid, and have dimensions of 5.5‚Äì8 by 5.5‚Äì6.5 ¬µm. =Similar species= The orange Hydnellum resembles the polypore Phaeolus schweinitzii when viewed from the top of the cap surface, but it has teeth instead of pores on the hymenium. Closely related and morphologically similar species in the genus Hydnellum include H. congenum (has thin flesh in the cap), H. ferrugipes and H. earlianum (has a smoother cap, and spines have sulfur-yellow tips, not white). Distribution and habitat This species is typically found growing solitary or in clusters on the ground in conifer and mixed woods. Rarely, fruit bodies may have their stipes fused together. Hydnellum aurantiacum has been reported from Australia, Europe, North America, and Asia, including China India, and Korea. It is one of the most frequently encountered Thelephorales species found in the Sverdlovsk region of Russia. Chemistry Skeletal formula of aurantiacin The pigment responsible for the characteristic orange color of H. aurantiacum has been identified as the p-terphenyl compound named aurantiacin. This dark red pigment, a derivative of the compound atromentin, has subsequently been identified in other species of Hydnellum. The compounds dihydroaurantiacin dibenzoate and thelephoric acid have also been reported. Hydnellum aurantiacum is used in mushroom dyeing, in which it produces grayish to greenish-gray colors depending on the mordant used.

Its facade is remarkable for its allegorical sgraffiti. Background Paul Cauchie was sixteen when he began his architectural studies at the Antwerp Royal Academy of Fine Arts (in the classes of Joseph Schadde and L√©onard Blomme). Very soon afterwards, he enrolled at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts (in the class of Constant Montald), where he studied painting (as a pupil of Jean Portaels) and the sgraffito technique, and followed courses in decorative painting (1893‚Äì1898). From 1895, whilst still pursuing his studies, Cauchie started to work for a living. Apart from his own house, only three houses built by Cauchie are known: two others in Brussels and one at Duinbergen. As Cauchie was more of a decorator than an architect, he specialised in designing sgraffiti for architecture. Cauchie met his future wife in the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. Carolina 'Lina' Voet achieved a very good level in painting, enabling her to teach drawing and painting privately. They married in 1905 and decided to build a house on the -wide plot of land Cauchie bought next to the Cinquantenaire Park. He designed the front of the house with the intention of advertising and selling their work: sgraffiti for him and art teaching for her. As the house was easily seen from the neighbouring roads, it drew the attention of passers-by and demonstrated their know-how. Building '\\"\\" (), a joint work intended for private use At the very centre of the facade, Cauchie drew the words \\"\\" (). The house was designed, from the very beginning, as a joint work intended for private use. Cauchie did the drawings for the house but worked together with his wife to design and decorate their home-workshop. Cauchie and his wife filled the house with their multiple works of art (paintings, wall coverings, furniture, etc.) The Cauchie House is a good example of the application of the principle of \\"total art\\" in architecture. Cauchie and his wife wanted that the distinction between the main art forms (architecture, painting, sculpture) and the minor art forms (decorative arts) disappeared to become part of the global ≈ìuvre. Tintin Museum in the Cauchie House In 1979, the saving of the Cauchie House led to the idea of using it to house an Adventures of Tintin museum in cooperation with their creator, Herg√©. Symbolically, on Christmas Day, 1980, Herg√© gave Dessicy his official agreement to the project. Dessicy undertook an intensive study with Bob De Moor, who laid the bases of the scenography. A scale model was made by the Studios Herg√©. Dessicy started to look for sponsors and supports. In the meantime, he devoted himself to saving another building, the former Magasins Waucquez, work of the Belgian architect Victor Horta. Despite many steps taken to find sponsors, Dessicy did not succeed in creating sufficient interest to complete his project of a Tintin Museum at the Cauchie House. Eventually, Desiccy succeeded in turning the Magasins Waucquez into the Belgian Comic Strip Center. The Cauchie House today The basement, containing the cellars and Paul Cauchie's workshop, has been converted into a vast gallery, exhibiting photos, paintings, and archive documents, meticulously collected over the years by the Maison Cauchie ASBL. They illustrate the stages of the house restoration and the artistic activities of Paul and Lina Cauchie. The ground floor freed of the unfortunate alteration carried out by the successive occupants after Paul's death has recovered its original appearance. The two upper floors of the house have been converted into apartments and renovated in accordance with contemporary needs.

It is a favourite food of North Queensland‚Äôs iconic flightless bird, the southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius). The cassowary plum can grow to about 30 metres. At the age of three years, it begins to produce white flowers during July, with red centers, which become the signature fruits. The fruit is egg shaped, large, smooth, and blue and ripens from January on. Cassowaries commonly eat cassowary plums, hence the name. The plums' sap is poisonous to most animals, including humans, but not to cassowaries, which consume the fruit with no ill effects, because of their short and fast digestive system, which passes the fruit relatively intact. The cassowary's stomach also contains a unique combination of digestive enzymes, making it immune to the toxins. The cassowary and the cassowary plum have a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship. The plum provides food for the cassowary, while the cassowary spreads the seeds of the tree. The bird eats the plums whole and passes them out mostly intact. The cassowary's stomach is said to massage the fruit, helping it grow. Cassowary plums are more likely to grow once they have been through a cassowary. Another of the few animals that can eat the fruit is the white-tailed rat (Uromys caudimaculatus). However, it does not assist in the growth of the seeds as the cassowary does, as it tears all of poisonous skin off and feeds on the seeds within.

Dr. John Morrow (28 June 1931 - 1 January 2009) was a Presbyterian minister and peace activist in Northern Ireland. He was integral in the 1965 founding of the Corrymeela Community, a Christian group committed to promoting peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. He succeeded Corrymeela's founder Ray Davey as the leader of the community in 1980 and served as its leader until 1993, providing it with a sense of cohesion and direction in its work of ecumenical Christian leadership and help for families during the Troubles. Education Morrow grew up on a dairy farm near Dundonald, on the outskirts of Belfast. He was educated at Campbell College grammar school and then at Queen's University, where he took primary and master's degrees in agriculture. He then decided to become a minister and completed his theological training at New College Edinburgh and at the former Assembly's College, now Union Theological College. Early career Morrow's first charge was at Seymour Hill Presbyterian Church near Lisburn, where he served as minister and pursued a career in the difficult and often controversial area of ecumenical relations. From 1958 to 1971, he was a member of the Iona Community, which greatly shaped his philosophy and Christian witness. Leader of Corrymeela In 1965, Morrow was a founding member of the Corrymeela Community, a Christian group committed to promoting peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. He served as the community's leader from 1980 - 1994, taking over the role from Corrymeela founder Ray Davey. He was involved with human rights issues, such as playing a role in the foundation of the Committee on the Administration of Justice, campaigning for the UDR Four, working as a member of the Faith and Politics Group, and helping with many other campaigns for justice on behalf of those affected by the Troubles. He also developed important links with church figures in the Netherlands, including the controversial Roel Kaptein, who shared with Corrymeela some of the stimulating philosophy of the noted critic and Bible commentator, Ren√© Girard. During the darkest days of the Troubles, Morrow regularly arranged sanctuary for families being intimidated by paramilitary organisations on both sides of the political divide in Northern Ireland. As Corrymeela's leader, Morrow promoted dialogue with the main political parties and met regularly with parties connected to paramilitary organisations, including Provisional Sinn F√©in and the Ulster Loyalist Democratic Party; the political wings of the Irish Republican Army and the Ulster Defence Association respectively. University chaplain Morrow also served as university chaplain to overseas students in Glasgow from 1967. From 1971, he was a student chaplain in Dublin where he helped to establish the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation. In 1975, he became the Presbyterian chaplain at Queen's University, where Ray Davey had been a founding predecessor. Morrow quickly demonstrated his own breadth of vision as chaplain, as well as his sturdy independence and leadership qualities. He was described by his students as having inspired them to take the vision of better relationships and understanding into the wider world. As Presbyterian Chaplain at Queens University, he encouraged the movement known as The Peace People, under the leadership of Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan. Later work After his time at Corrymeela, Morrow worked in association with the Irish School of Ecumenics as a lecturer and Northern Ireland co-ordinator. He published his memoir, entitled On the Road of Reconciliation: A Brief Memoir, in 2004. Morrow received an honorary doctorate from the University of Ulster in 2006. Personal life Morrow married Shirley Duncan on 29 December 1959; Shirley died on 8 July 2004. The couple had four children; Duncan, Philip, Alison, and Neil. John died in his sleep on 1 January 2009.

The molecular weight of polyDADMAC is typically in the range of hundreds of thousands of grams per mole, and even up to a million for some products. PolyDADMAC is usually delivered as a liquid concentrate having a solids level in the range of 10 to 50%. It is a high charge density cationic polymer. The charge density makes it well suited for flocculation. History PolyDADMAC polymers were first prepared and studied in 1957 by Professor George Butler at the University of Florida.G. B. Butler, R. J. Angelo: J. Am. Chem. Soc., 79, 3128 (1957) It was remarkable as it was soluble in water in contrast at the time to other known synthetic polymers formed by polymerization of monomers containing more than one vinyl functionality. The structure and reaction path was determined in 2002 with NMR studies. Synthesis The monomer DADMAC is formed by reacting two equivalents of allyl chloride with dimethylamine. PolyDADMAC is then synthesized by radical polymerization of DADMAC with an organic peroxide used as a catalyst. Two polymeric structures are possible when polymerizing DADMAC: N-substituted piperidine structure or N-substituted pyrrolidine structure. The pyrrolidine structure is favored. :Polymerization of PolyDADMAC (shown as favoured pyrrolidine structure) ApplicationsEffluent treatment= PolyDADMAC is used in waste water treatment as a primary organic coagulant which neutralizes negatively charged colloidal material and reduces sludge volume compared with inorganic coagulants. =Pulp and paper industry= PolyDADMAC is used for controlling disturbing substances in the papermaking process. It provides superior fixing of pitch from mechanical pulp and of latex from coated broke. Used in the short circulation of a paper mill to enhance retention and dewatering. In addition, it can be used to improve the efficiency of disk filters and flotators, and for cationization of fillers to provide maximal filler retention. =Water purification= PolyDADMAC is used as a coagulant in water purification. It is effective in coagulating and flocculating inorganic and organic particles such as silt, clay, algae, bacteria and viruses. At high concentrations the organic polymer can remove natural organic matter such as humic and fulvic acids resulting in fewer disinfection byproduct precursors and less color.Edzwald, James K., ed.

His mother was the Hasmonean princess Mariamne. The unfortunate fate which persistently pursued the Hasmonean house overtook this prince also. As heir presumptive to the throne by right of descent on his mother's side, he was sent to Rome for his education in the year 23 BC. He remained there in the household of Asinius Pollio until about the year 17 BC, when Herod himself brought him and his younger brother Aristobulus, who had been with him, home to Jerusalem. Shortly afterward Alexander received in marriage the Cappadocian Princess Glaphyra, the daughter of King Archelaus of Cappadocia. Glaphyra bore Alexander three children, two sons: Tigranes, Alexander and an unnamed daughter. Demise Alexander's handsome presence and frank bearing made him a favorite with the people, and they longed for the day when the house of the Maccabees should mount the throne instead of the half-Jew Herod. But, on the other hand, a certain degree of vanity and a spirit of vindictiveness, which marked him no less than his prepossessing qualities, rendered him extremely unpopular with the partisans of Herod, who had much to fear from a future King Alexander. Josephus was writing for a Roman audience, after a major rebellion and this may not genuine criticism. Salome repeatedly warned Herod of danger threatening him from Alexander and his brother Aristobulus. The king felt that it was not impossible that his sons meditated revenge for Mariamne's execution; and on the other hand, the open antipathy expressed by them against their father combined to open the king's ear to the calumnies of Salome and her fellow-plotters. Herod's attempt to humiliate Alexander by restoring to honor Antipater, an older son by another wife, resulted disastrously. Antipater's insidious plotting and the open enmity to Herod shown by Alexander widened the breach between father and son to such an extent that in the year 12 BC, Herod felt himself constrained to bring charges against his sons before Augustus. A reconciliation was brought about, but it was of short duration; and shortly afterward (about 10 BC) Alexander was thrown into prison upon the evidence of a tortured witness who accused him of planning the murder of Herod. Intercepted letters were produced which revealed Alexander's bitterness against his father. In vain did Archelaus, Alexander's father-in-law, endeavor to bring about better relations between them; the reconciliation was again a brief one, so that once more the intrigues of Antipater and Salome succeeded in securing the incarceration of Alexander and Aristobulus (about 8 BC). This was dynastic conflict, in the key territory bridging West and East and the context was instability erupting across the Roman Empire. Conviction Herod lodged formal complaint of high treason against them with Augustus, who put the matter into Herod's own hands, with the advice to appoint a court of inquiry to consist of Roman officials and his own friends. Such a court of hirelings and favorites was naturally unanimous for conviction. The attempts of Alexander's friends, by means of petition to King Herod, to avert the execution of the sentence, resulted in the death of Tero ‚Äî an old and devoted servant of Herod who openly remonstrated with the king for the enormity of the proposed judicial crime ‚Äî and of 300 others who were denounced as partisans of Alexander. The sentence was carried out without delay; about the year 7 BC, at Sebaste (Samaria) ‚Äî where thirty years before Mariamne's wedding had been celebrated ‚Äî her sons suffered death by the cord.

Denean Sharpley-Whiting - An insightful collection of essays about then- candidate Barack Obama's 2008 speech on race in Philadelphia. Los Angeles Times, August 09, 2009.  The speech  The speech was delivered on March 18, 2008 in the course of the contest for the 2008 Democratic Party presidential nomination. Speaking before an audience at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Obama was responding to a spike in the attention paid to controversial remarks made by the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, his former pastor and, until shortly before the speech, a participant in his campaign. Obama framed his response in terms of the broader issue of race in the United States. The speech's title was taken from the Preamble to the United States Constitution. Obama addressed the subjects of racial tensions, white privilege, and race and inequality in the United States, discussing black \\"anger,\\" white \\"resentment,\\" and other issues as he sought to explain and contextualize Wright's comments. His speech closed with a plea to move beyond America's \\"racial stalemate\\" and address shared social problems. On March 27, 2008, the Pew Research Center called the speech \\"arguably the biggest political event of the campaign so far,\\" noting that 85 percent of Americans said they had heard at least a little about the speech and that 54 percent said they heard a lot about it. Eventually, The New Yorker opined that the speech helped elect Obama as the President of the United States.Hendrik Hertzberg, \\"Obama Wins, The New Yorker, November 17, 2008, p. 40, found at The New Yorker website. Accessed November 18, 2008. The speech itself was widely praised as eloquent and honest and concerned racial issues in the United States.

Over the course of the team's history, the team has had several logos while wearing virtually the same uniforms over the years, with subtle changes made to give the uniforms an updated look. The team colors, uniforms, and logo are often ranked as being among the best in the NFL. Colors The Steelers have used black and gold as their colors since the club's inception, the lone exception being the 1943 season when they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles and formed the \\"Steagles\\"; the team's colors at that time were green and white as a result of wearing Eagles uniforms. These are the colors of the city's official flag which are the colors of the city's namesake Sir William Pitt. The colors black and gold are also representative of the two ingredients to create steel, coal and iron ore. Originally, the team wore gold colored helmets and black jerseys. Unique to Pittsburgh, the Steelers' black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city, including the Pittsburgh Pirates in baseball and the Pittsburgh Penguins in ice hockey. Logo The Steelers (then known as the Pittsburgh Pirates) first logo was the city coat of arms. Current logo of the Steelers. The Steelers have had several logos in the early part of their history, among them including the crest of Pittsburgh, a football with Pittsburgh's then-smoggy skyline, as well as a construction worker hanging onto a chain holding a pennant. Another logo showed the worker punting a football on a steel beam. It is rumored that mascot Steely McBeam was based on the latter logo. Since 1963, the team has used a stencil typeface for its script logo. Since then, many team-related typefaces have used stencil font. The team's current primary logo was introduced in 1962 and is based on the flag originally designed by Pittsburgh's U.S. Steel and now owned by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). Ironically, it was Robert Sexton, an employee out of the Pittsburgh office of Cleveland-based Republic Steel, that suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo. It consists of the word \\"Steel\\" surrounded by three astroids (hypocycloids of four cusps). The original meanings behind the astroids were, \\"Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure, and widens your world.\\" Later, the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel-making process: yellow for coal, orange for iron ore, and blue for scrap steel. While the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word \\"Steel,\\" the team was given permission to add \\"ers\\" in 1963 after a petition against AISI. While the logo still resembles the original Steelmark logo, the team has made subtle changes over the years in order to own a trademark on the logo, most notably making the three astroids thicker in shape and changing the orange astroid to red. The Steelmark logo itself has actually been heavily redesigned since then, using two variants, one of which uses a more modern design and uses three shades of blue for the astroids while another one used concurrently has a strong resemblance to the recycling symbol. One alternate variation the team used in the 1980s‚Äîthough rarely used today‚Äîcombined the logo with the team's signature stencil-script typeface, replacing the regular \\"Steelers\\" typeface used with the team's longtime script logo. Helmets The Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side). Longtime field and equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets; however, its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently.Official site of the Pittsburgh Steelers - Logo History Since then, several college football teams such as Michigan State have followed the Steelers approach at one point or another and had their logo on only one side of the helmet. At the end of the 1962 season, they switched to black helmets for the 1962 Playoff Bowl to make it stand out more, and adopted the black helmets full time from the 1963 season onward. In 1977, the Steelers switched facemask colors from gray to black. Another feature of the helmet is that a player's uniform number appears on both the front and back (the Steelers are one of only two teams in the NFL to do so, with the other team being the New York Giants). Just like the Giants, the Steelers have the two digit helmet numbers located to the left and right of the center stripe on both the front and back of the helmets. Also just like the Giants, the Steelers have the one digit helmet number located on the center stripe on both the front and back of the helmets. The numbers traditionally do not appear on the front of the helmet during the exhibition season, and also do not appear on the front of the throwback helmets. The Steelers re-introduced gold helmets in 2007, paired with their 1962 throwback uniforms. The gold helmets featured the current Steelers logo rather than the original version of the Steelmark that was worn in 1962, and were also paired with black facemasks. These helmets continued to be used through the 2011 season. When the Steelers replaced the 1962 throwback with the 1933 horizontally-striped \\"bumblebee\\" throwbacks in 2012, the team retired the gold helmets. UniformsEarly years= The Steelers have made only a few changes to their jerseys over the years. Originally, the team had vertically-striped jerseys that resembled prison uniforms at the time, with some variations having the city of Pittsburgh crest on the front, a la NHL uniforms. The team would later wear these uniforms as throwbacks in 1994. A horizontally-striped uniform with the uniform numbers placed on rectangular panels also appeared in the 1933 season; this design was worn as a throwback from 2012 until 2016. The team adopted more standard NFL uniforms in 1936 and added Northwestern striping to the sleeves, and with the team finishing 0.500 for the first time in team history that season (at 6-6), the stripes have largely remained on the uniforms since. The striping pattern is named for Northwestern University, the college that is believed to have originated the pattern. One exception that the stripes were omitted prior to the 1960s was from the aforementioned \\"Steagles\\" season because the team wore the Eagles uniforms as a cost-saving measure. The Eagles' jerseys at the time were green with white shoulders and no stripes. The Rooneys have acknowledged that because the combined team wore the Eagles uniforms that year, it is the only time in team history that the colors were something other than black & gold. =Two white jerseys= Due to uniform experimentation in the 1960s, on two separate occasions the team's stripes were omitted. The first time came in 1962, when the Steelers began to wear two types of white jerseys, one of which featured a gold diamond on the sleeves in place of the stripes, with the \\"TV numbers\\" situated on the diamonds. These jerseys were primarily worn in home games when the team didn't wear their black jerseys, since the NFL at the time was encouraging teams to wear white jerseys so fans could see the team colors of their opponents. The other jersey featured gold sleeves and a black version of the stripes, and were worn in road games when the home team elected to wear their colored jerseys. The team continued this way through the 1965 season. =Caped Crusaders= Batman\\"-style uniforms the team experimented with in 1966-1967. Perhaps the most infamous uniforms the team has ever worn came in 1966, when the team experimented with the \\"Batman\\"-themed uniforms, named as such because they were similar to the Batman outfits Adam West wore on the popular TV series. The jersey had no stripes on either the black or white jerseys and had a gold triangle-like diamond covering the shoulders. Although they have been commonly called the \\"Batman\\" uniforms, Dan Rooney later made public his reasoning behind the uniforms. With his father still running the team and the Vince Lombardi-led Green Bay Packers being the class of the NFL, the younger Rooney (who still had a much smaller role with the team at the time) didn't want to follow the lead of other NFL teams trying to copy the Packers and wanted the Steelers to have a unique look. Coinciding with this was the development of the Golden Triangle in the city of Pittsburgh in the 1960s, so Rooney decided to give the uniforms a connection to the growing downtown district with the gold triangle-like diamond. Although both Rooney and NFL Films's Steve Sabol liked the look (Sabol mentioned that you could easily tell when the Steelers played),http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/dailycourier/bridal/s_527501.html the players didn't, adding that they looked like clowns or Batman, which is likely where the \\"Batman\\" rumors began. Due to primitive washing techniques at the time (as well as NFL teams frequently reusing the uniforms, unlike today where current supplier Nike gives teams new uniforms every game), the Steelers had trouble washing the uniforms because the gold triangle faded easily. Rooney was even asked on a radio show in Dallas when the team was playing the Cowboys on October 30, 1966 if the team was wearing the uniforms for Halloween. The uniforms were retired after two seasons. The team has mentioned publicly as recently as 2007 that they will never wear them in a game again. However, in 2008, the team began to sell customized versions of the jerseys on their official Web site. Fittingly, several Steelers players appear in the 2012 Batman film The Dark Knight Rises in a scene which was filmed in Heinz Field. =Modern classics= After just two years with the \\"Batman\\" uniforms, the current uniform designs were introduced in 1968. The design was a modernized version of the pre-1966 black design and consists of gold pants and either black jerseys or white jerseys, except for the 1970 and 1971 seasons when the Steelers wore white pants with their white jerseys; the TV numbers were uniquely positioned between the sleeve and shoulder, at the apex of the shoulder. After a two-year hiatus, the Northwestern-style stripes returned for good, with the black jerseys getting white stripes in the two gaps of the gold stripes while the white jerseys got black outlines on the gold stripes, essentially making the stripe pattern the same on both jerseys. Both variations have been heavily used in team apparel. Although the stripes initially went all the way around the sleeves, since the 2000 season they now stop in the middle of the jersey; this is due to football jerseys in general shortening the sleeves to reduce holding calls. As the sleeves continued to become shorter, and especially with the NFL's changeover to Nike as their league-wide uniform provider in the 2012 season, the full stripe pattern is no longer worn by most players, as the stripes are truncated at the bottom of the wide gold stripe. One exception to this trend is quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who, like a number of other starting quarterbacks, has continued to wear longer sleeves with the full striping pattern. The helmet is solid black with a gold central stripe and small white player numbers on the forehead. Last names were added to the jerseys in 1970, as part of a new NFL mandate resulting from the AFL-NFL merger (the AFL teams had last names on the back of their jerseys). The names have always been gold with black trim on the white uniforms, except from 1970‚Äì71 when it didn't have black trim, and during the 1997 season when it was colored black. On the black uniforms, the player names were in gold without any additional trim. In 1997, the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font (Futura Condensed) on the helmets (though during the preseason and Week 1, player names remained in a block lettering), and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey; the TV numbers moved fully to the shoulder pad with these changes. The Steelers are often praised and recognized with their uniforms due to their traditional style while other teams such as the Arizona Cardinals, Atlanta Falcons, Denver Broncos and Minnesota Vikings have introduced more radical uniforms in recent years. When Reebok signed a contract to become the exclusive uniform supplier to the NFL in 2000 (replacing Nike, whom the Steelers had from 1997-2000, and had Starter before Nike) Reebok had announced that all NFL teams would be changing their uniforms for the 2002 NFL season, when Reebok's contract took effect. Dan Rooney, one of the league's most influential owners, stated several times in public that the Steelers would NOT be changing their uniforms despite Reebok stating otherwise. Eventually, Reebok rescinded its proposal due to several owners protesting after taking Rooney's lead. (The Buffalo Bills and Seattle Seahawks redesigned their uniforms for 2002 anyway.) Aside from introducing throwbacks in 2007, the Steelers did not made any changes to their uniforms during Reebok's time as the NFL's uniform supplier. When the league switched to Nike in 2012, the Steelers again stood pat on their uniforms, although they did replace their throwback design. In 1979, the team gave the Big Ten's Iowa Hawkeyes permission to use the Steelers uniform designs, since both teams had the same color scheme. Aside from Iowa using its Tigerhawk logo as well as continuing to use the block numbers that the Steelers themselves replaced with the rounder numbers in 1997, the two uniform sets remain identical today. =Black at home= The Steelers are one of a dwindling number of NFL franchises that strictly wears its team color jerseys at home, always opting for black. They are the only ones in the AFC North to practice this. The Cleveland Browns have traditionally had on again/off again periods of wearing white at home, while the Baltimore Ravens and Cincinnati Bengals, like some other NFL teams, wear white in their home opener before wearing their darker jerseys in their remaining home games. The Steelers last wore white at home on a regular basis in 1969, Chuck Noll's first season as coach and the last year the team played in Pitt Stadium. Because of the team's unofficial policy of always wearing their black jerseys in home games, the team gained some notoriety when, as the designated \\"home\\" team for Super Bowl XL, the team elected to wear their white jerseys, becoming just the third NFL team to elect to wear white as the \\"home\\" team in the Super Bowl (Denver would later elect to wear white as the home team in Super Bowl 50 and New England would elect to wear white as the home team in Super Bowl LII). But while the other two teams that have elected to wear white as the \\"home\\" team in the Super Bowl (Dallas in Super Bowl XIII and Super Bowl XXVII, and Washington in Super Bowl XVII) traditionally wear white at home, a variety of reasons were rumored as to why the Steelers elected to wear white in Super Bowl XL. Reasons included the fact that the team wore white in all three playoff victories that year (all on the road) to former head coach Bill Cowher's comments that since it wasn't at Heinz Field, it was a road game (a statement contradicted by the fact that ten years earlier in Super Bowl XXX, Cowher's squad was the \\"home team\\" and chose to wear their black jerseys away from Three Rivers Stadium, where they had played both playoff games‚Äìand did so against the Cowboys, whose opponents will often wear white at home simply to force them to use their \\"unlucky\\" blue jerseys). The game took place in Detroit, which is only a five-hour drive from Pittsburgh and with the league preferring to have the Super Bowl in subtropical or Mediterranean climates or in domed/retractable roof stadiums due to the winter weather, is likely the closest the Steelers would have to a home game in a Super Bowl in the foreseeable future. (Not surprisingly, there were also an overwhelming number of Steelers fans at the game compared to the number of supporters of their opponent, the Seattle Seahawks. One ESPN.com columnist suggested that Steelers fans outnumbered Seahawks fans by a ratio of 25 to 1.ESPN - Steelers get past Seahawks for fifth Super Bowl win in club history - NFL Football Recap) Having been the Cowboys' opponent in XIII, the Steelers are the only team to have worn both white jerseys for a \\"home\\" Super Bowl and colored jerseys for an \\"away\\" one. =Throwback uniforms= Hines Ward wearing the Steelers 75th anniversary uniform in 2007. At a press conference on April 27, 2007, it was announced that the Steelers would wear a throwback uniform for two home games during the 2007 season, as part of the celebration of the Steelers' 75th Season. They were worn for the Steelers' home opener against the Buffalo Bills on September 16 and again during the Monday Night Football game on November 5 against the Baltimore Ravens. Both games resulted in victories. The jersey is black with the numbers, names and stripes all in gold and it also contains a 75th Season logo on the right side of the upper chest part of the jersey. The jersey is considered to be from the 1960 season. The pants are white with a single gold stripe running down the length of the outside of each leg, surrounded by thinner black stripes on either side of the gold stripe. The helmets are gold with the Steelers logo on the right side and a single black stripe running down the center from front to back. The helmet was worn during the 1962 season, which was the first year that the present Steelers logo began to appear on their helmets. The only two differences are that the logo on the original helmet read 'Steel', whereas Steelers appears on the helmet that the team wore for the two games in 2007 and that the face mask on this version of the helmet is black, whereas the original face mask color on the gold helmet was gray. The throwbacks, minus the \\"75th season\\" patch, are now officially the team's alternate uniform as of the 2008 season, and are usually worn for games that honor the team's alumni.A fun weekend for Steelers alumni Since their introduction in 2007, the Steelers have worn the throwbacks the NFL maximum of twice per year, with the team's annual home matchup against the rival Baltimore Ravens receiving one of the allotments each year. The other matchups have included the Buffalo Bills in 2007, the New York Giants in 2008 (the first loss in the throwbacks), and the San Diego Chargers in 2009 (Sunday night contest). 2010 saw the team sporting the throwback uniforms at the October 17 game against the Cleveland Browns, and for the November 14, Sunday Night Football game against the New England Patriots (their second loss). In 2011, they wore throwback uniforms for the November 6 home game against the Baltimore Ravens (which was their third loss in the throwbacks) and December 8 home game against the Cleveland Browns. The throwback gold helmets have often been worn in practice in addition to the regular black helmets, a highly unusual move among NFL teams whose throwbacks use a different helmet than their current design. The uniforms worn by the Steelers in 2012‚Äì13, including the throwback kit honoring the 1934 team. For the 2012 season, as part of their 80th anniversary, the Steelers wore horizontally-striped throwback uniforms inspired by the 1934 Pittsburgh Pirates football team. The Steelers wore the throwbacks for their October 28 game against the Washington Redskins and for their November 18 game against the Baltimore Ravens.Games announced for throwback jerseys The uniforms have drawn major media attention. USA Today said that the Steelers looked like \\"bumblebee[s] in a Depression-era chain gang.\\"Steelers' jailbird bumblebee throwbacks causing a stir 65% of respondents to an ESPN poll said they hated the throwback uniforms.Poll results: Steelers throwback uniforms NBC Sports' Pro Football Talk blog said the 2012 throwback uniform \\"ranks among the worst ever fashioned for any NFL team.\\"Steelers breaking out new throwbacks this week The throwbacks were officially retired after the 2016 season. For the 2018 season, the Steelers will wear throwback black uniforms based on the design worn by the Steel Curtain teams of the 1970s. It is similar to their current uniforms but without the Steelers logo on the left chest and using block lettering and numbers instead of Futura Condensed. =Color Rush= As part of the NFL Color Rush program, the Steelers debuted all-black uniforms in the 2016 season. The jerseys feature the same stripes as the standard black jersey, with the only change being that the white stripes are now also gold. The numerals are in gold as well, although in the traditional block font instead of Futura Condensed. The pants are black with a thick gold stripe, the reverse of their normal gold pants. Solid black socks and shoes completed the uniform, although some players were permitted to wear gold shoes.

Webb of New York for the Merchants Steamship Company. One of Narragansett Bay's so-called \\"floating palaces\\", the luxuriously outfitted Bristol and her sister ship Providence, each of which could carry up to 1,200 passengers, were installed with the largest engines then built in the United States, and were considered to be amongst the finest American-built vessels of their era. Both ships would spend their entire careers steaming between New York and various destinations in and around Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. Bristol was eventually destroyed by a fire while in port in 1888. Development Bristol and Providence owed their existence to a short-lived company known as the Merchants Steamship Company, which placed the initial order for the vessels with the Webb shipyard in about 1865. Merchants Steamship was an amalgamation of three existing Narragansett Bay shipping lines, the Commercial Line, Neptune Line and Stonington Line. The Company intended to run the two steamers between New York and Bristol, Rhode Island in competition with the Fall River Line, which ran a similar service from New York to Fall River, Massachusetts (both Lines then linking up to railway lines that continued on to Boston).Covell, pp. 4-5. Construction Casting the mammoth cylinder of either Bristol or Providence--probably Bristol--at the Etna Iron Works, February 3, 1866 Work on both Bristol and Providence was delayed by a long strike, but Bristol was eventually launched on 4 April 1866,\\"Launch of the Sound Steamer Bristol\\", The New York Times, 1866-04-05. and Providence on July 28 of the same year.\\"General City News\\", The New York Times, July 28, 1866. Between December 1865 and December 1866 however, the Merchants Steamship Company lost three of its existing ships, all of which were uninsured, thereby bankrupting the Company. Bristol and Providence remained in an uncompleted state at the shipyard until a new company, the Narragansett Steamship Company, which was partly owned by financier Jim Fisk, bought the new vessels in early 1867 and paid for their completion.Covell, p. 11. =Engines= Bristol and Providence were both fitted with massive 110-inch-cylinder (9 foot 2 inch), 12-foot stroke walking beam engines, the largest engines ever fitted to American vessels up to that time - larger even than the 100-inch-cylinder engines for the mammoth ironclad built at the Webb shipyard around the same time. The steamboats' engines, which operated at the stately pace of 19 rpm, were designed by Erasmus W. Smith and built by the Etna Iron Works, which had only recently installed a lathe capable of boring such huge cylinders. The lathe itself was one of the two largest machine tools in the United States, the other being a planer installed by the same company.Swann, p. 20. Description When completed, Bristol and Providence were amongst the largest and most lavishly outfitted American vessels of their time. They were the largest wooden-hulled steamers ever built for service on Long Island Sound and the first to have two full passenger decks above the main deck.Dunbaugh: \\"Long Island Sound nightboats in 1900.\\" Each ship had 240 staterooms and over 300 berths, capable of accommodating 1,200 passengers, 840 of them in sleeping quarters. Their freight capacity was estimated at 40 railroad freight cars each. Their wooden hulls and paddle-boxes were strengthened with iron cross- bracings, while for safety they were installed with watertight compartments. The ships had gas lighting, and later on, steam heating and steam-powered steering. The decks, which were built of white oak, included an extra \\"gallery tier\\" deck from which passengers could view their surroundings.Covell, pp. 21-22. Interior of Bristols saloon, showing the lavish appointments Contemporary American observers gushed over the size and sophistication of the ships, lauding them as \\"world renowned mammoth palace steamers\\", \\"so far in advance of the type of steamboats heretofore built that they were looked upon as marvels\\" and \\"the finest specimens of marine architecture of their day.\\" One observer described the interiors thus: > ... The painting, by George C. Barker & Son, and the decorating by Hayman, > of this city, have been a source of enormous outlay, but the result is an > equivalent to the cost, for the passenger, on arriving at the Quarter Deck > and proceeding to the Grand Saloon, must certainly imagine that he is in the > halls of enchantment, only read of in the Arabian Nights' Entertainments. In > each panel of the quarter-deck is painted a piece of statuary, while every > nook and corner is covered with paint of the most delicate hue and finished > off with an abundance of gilt.

Here, there, and everywhere, are flowers and birds, the one, in > some cases, just appearing to blossom and the other, apparently, just > waiting to spring from a branch, whereon it is perched, so naturally is > everything done. In the main saloon, ladies' saloon, and social hall, may be > seen very delightful specimens of good taste in the selection of the new > velvet carpets, rugs, mats, silk curtains, lace curtains, etc., all of which > are of the very costliest kind.

As a finishing touch, flamboyant owner Jim Fisk had 250 canaries in cages installed in each ship, each bird personally named by Fisk himself. Bristol and Providence began a tradition of luxury travel on Narragansett Bay that would remain a popular attraction to travellers for the next fifty years. For a modest price, an ordinary working person could gain a glimpse of the opulent lifestyles of the wealthy just by taking a cruise on such a vessel.\\"The Fall River Line and Other Steamers\\" , by Kay Davis, University of Virginia. Service history Bristol underway, illustration by Stanton On the cover of Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, the Bristol is one of the ships shown passing under the newly-completed Brooklyn Bridge . Bristol made her maiden voyage in June 1867, and for the next two years was to maintain the run from New York to Bristol, Rhode Island, as part of the Narragansett Steamship Company's Bristol Line. In 1869, the Narragansett Steamship Company merged with the Boston, Newport and New York Steamboat Company, and Bristol and her sister ship Providence thus joined the latter Company's Fall River Line. The two vessels began running from New York to Fall River, Massachusetts, with a stop at Newport, Rhode Island, while the service to Bristol was discontinued. Bristol would subsequently maintain the New York-Fall River route to the end of her career.Covell, p. 21. =Innovations in customer service= An advertisement for Bristol and Providence, emphasizing the onboard musical entertainment When first put into service, the owner of the Narragansett Steamship Company, Jim Fisk, would don an elaborate Admiral's uniform and greet every passenger boarding Bristol (or her sister ship Providence) at the gangway. Right on schedule, Fisk would give the order to sail, and the ship would put to sea \\"with the heavy load of passengers crowding her decks, music playing, flags flying, all her crew in uniform, each man having a badge on his cap showing his office and duty...\\". Fisk would remain on board until the ship pulled well out into the bay, at which time the vessel would stop and he would transfer to a pilot boat which would take him back to the city, after which Bristol would continue on her way.\\"The Old Fall River Line\\" by Oliver Jensen, American Heritage magazine, December 1954, Volume 6, Issue 1, as reproduced at americanheritage.com. This elaborate sailing ceremony was soon discontinued, and Fisk contented himself with remaining on shore to salute the ship in his Admiral's uniform as she put out to sea. Two of Fisk's other innovations however, were to have a more lasting impact. These were, firstly, the supply of uniforms to the crews of his ships, an unusual practice at the time, but one which had an agreeable impact on customers, and secondly, the employment of a band of musicians on each vessel to entertain passengers on their journey. Both of these innovations would thenceforth become traditions on Fall River Line steamers.Covell, pp. 24-27. =Collisions and other accidents= Over the course of her 21-year career, Bristol was involved in several collisions and other accidents, many of them occurring in conditions of heavy fog. The more significant of these are listed below. In July 1869, Bristol collided with and sank a bark near Sands Point, New York. Fortunately the crew of the latter was rescued. In October of the same year, Bristol ran ashore on Bishop's Rock, off Coddington Point, Newport, remaining there for a day before being removed safely and without damage. On 10 August 1872, Bristol ran into and sank the bark Bessie Rogers, which was at anchor outside the Torpedo Station on Goat Island, Rhode Island, in conditions of thick fog. Bessie Rogers was later salvaged and resumed service. Bristol was to run ashore in much the same area about eighteen months later, on April 12, 1874, but no damage was done and the ship was refloated three hours later with the assistance of the revenue cutter Samuel Dexter. Bristol ran ashore again in thick fog on the mud flats near Newport Harbor on June 14, 1877, remaining there until floated off by the rising tide about four hours later.Covell, pp. 27-28. Destruction Bristol departed New York on what was to become her final voyage on December 29, 1888, arriving at Newport Harbor around 3am on December 30. Around 6am, people on the wharf noticed flames breaking through the ship's upper deck near the engine. The flames spread so quickly that the last passengers had difficulty leaving the ship. Firemen arrived but were unable to contain the flames. After several hours, most of the ship except the hull and paddle-boxes, which were too saturated with salt water to burn, had been destroyed, and the ship subsequently sank. The remains of the vessel were raised on January 25, 1889, towed to the south dock and sold. In March a wrecking schooner removed the ship's machinery, after which the hull was presumably scrapped.Covell, p. 28.

Fisk hosted Grant on the voyage, while a number of other business leaders, including financier Jay Gould, also took passage in hopes of making Grant's acquaintance. Fisk went on to accompany Grant to the Boston Jubilee, and dressed once again in his flamboyant admiral's uniform, managed to upstage the U.S. President upon their entry together, from which he was to earn the nickname \\"Jubilee Jim\\".Dayton, Fred Erving (1925): Steamboat Days, Frederick A. Stokes Company, New York, Chapter entitled \\"The Life and Times of Colonel James Fisk, Jr.\\"; pp. 202-204, cited in Covell, p. 26. =Collisions and other accidents= Over the course of her 29-year career, Providence was involved in several collisions and other accidents. The more significant of these are listed below. On September 10, 1875, one of Providence's paddleboxes was damaged in a heavy storm off Point Judith, and the ship was forced to turn around and return slowly to Newport for repairs. On September 28, 1877, a schooner accidentally rammed Providence, the bowsprit penetrating through two staterooms to the inner saloon, but fortunately no-one was injured. On October 19, 1880, off Watch Hill, the port shaft of the eastbound Providence broke. A small propeller steamer named Albatross initially attempted a tow, but the larger City of Fitchburg then arrived on the scene and towed the stricken Providence back to Newport. Mechanical repairs took about two weeks. Providence's most serious accident occurred on June 22, 1887. At high tide, the steamer ran into the sand spit southeast of Hog Island, and could not be refloated for several weeks. The hull suffered considerable damage, requiring extended repairs, and the steamer City of Worcester (1881) was chartered to operate in her place while the repairs were effected. The following year, Providence was involved in another serious accident when she ran into and sank the steam yacht Adelaide.Covell 1933. pp. 28‚Äì30. =Final years= Providence was retired from regular service after the introduction of two new iron-hulled steamers, Puritan (1889) and Plymouth (1890), but was still used on occasion until Priscilla was added to the Fall River Line's fleet in 1894. Thereafter, Providence was only used when there were no other alternatives. Her last commercial voyages are believed to have occurred between December 1895 and early 1896, when she was called upon to operate for a few days when some of the regular steamers were temporarily out of commission. Providence's last years were spent tied up at Briggs Wharf, Newport. In the autumn of 1901, the vessel was sold for scrap and towed to Boston for dismantling. After the removal of her furnishings and machinery, Providence suffered the typical fate of wooden steamers of her time by being hauled onto a beach and burned in order to recover the remaining brass, copper, and other metal fittings.Covell 1933. p. 30.

Biography He received his painting tuition at the Antwerp Academy of Fine Arts under Jozef Jacobs and Mattheus Ignatius van Bree. After 1835 he made many travels including to England and Scotland, Paris and Italy.D. Cardyn-Oomen. \\"De Keyser, Nicaise.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 2 March 2014 He married the genre painter Isabella Telghuys on 6 October 1840. In 1846, he was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician. When in 1855 the leading Belgian Romantic painter Gustave Wappers resigned as director of the Antwerp Academy, de Keyser succeeded him. As with the work of other Belgian history painters such as Edouard de Bi√®fve, Ernest Slingeneyer and Louis Gallait, there was particular appreciation for Nicaise de Keyser's history paintings in German-speaking Europe. De Keyser regularly travelled to Germany and in 1873 he was awarded the famous Prussian order \\"Pour le M√©rite\\". Despite his great success and fame throughout his lifetime, his work, like that of the other Belgian Romantic painters, was quickly forgotten in the 20th century. He had many students, including L√©on Abry, Alo√Øs Boudry, Edgard Farasyn, Godfried Guffens, Edouard Hamman, Joseph Lies, George Du Maurier, Karel Ooms, Ferdinand Pauwels, , Jan Swerts, Eliza Turck, , Jan Verhas, Frans Verhas and Charles Verlat.Biographical details at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Work Battle of the Golden Spurs (1836). De Keyser was an extremely prolific painter and is said to have produced more than 350 paintings. Having debuted with religious pictures, his attention was later drawn to his country's history. His breakthrough as a painter came with the canvas Battle of the Golden Spurs, which was exhibited at the Brussels Salon in 1836. It depicts a scene from an important historical battle between France and Flanders of 1302. Seeing the painting is said to have inspired the Belgian writer Hendrik Conscience to write his book \\"De Leeuw van Vlaanderen\\" (The Lion of Flanders) about the Flemish battle for independence from the French. The success of de Keyser's work was followed by his less impressive work, the Battle of Worringen of 1288. Starting in 1862, de Keyser painted a series of decorative historical paintings that celebrated the Flemish school of art. The paintings were intended for the former Antwerp museum and academy building. When the new Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp was completed in the late nineteenth century, the paintings were transferred to the staircase of the museum. De Keyser belonged to the first wave of Belgian Romantic painters who had typically studied or spent time in Paris where they had come into contact with the new Romantic movement. Others in this group included Gustave Wappers, Louis Gallait, Ernest Slingeneyer, Edouard de Bi√®fve and other minor figures. They chose as the subject matter of their work important historical events in Belgium's history which were regarded as key to the country's national identity. Unlike their French models such as Delacroix, their work, though colourful, lacked true Romantic zest and became popular with the artistic establishment which rewarded the artists with numerous commissions.Johan Decavele, et al. \\"Belgium.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 22 February 2014. Despite the Romantic subject matter and the Baroque compositional techniques of his historical and genre paintings, the finishing of de Keyser's paintings is in academic style, with the use of sharp lines and clearly drawn details. De Keyser also painted genre paintings and elegantly refined portraits.

The phrase \\"underground railroad\\" was resurrected and applied in the 1960s to the extensive network of draft counseling groups and houses used to help Vietnam-era draft dodgers escape to Canada, and was also applied in the 1970s to the clandestine movement of people and goods by the American Indian Movement in and out of occupied Native American reservation lands. (See Wounded Knee).AIM - American Indian Movement Store Since then, the term has come to designate various subcultures such as mod culture, hippie culture, punk rock culture, techno music/rave culture and underground hip hop. Terminology The unmodified term \\"The underground\\" was a common name for World War II resistance movements. It was later applied to counter-cultural movement(s) many of which sprang up during the 1960s. For the first time the printed term \\"underground\\" used art-critic Manny Farber (1957). A way to define it is a quote by Frank Zappa: :\\"The mainstream comes to you, but you have to go to the underground.\\" Applied to the arts, the term underground typically means artists who are not corporately sponsored and generally do not want to be. History The 1960s and 1970s underground cultural movements had some connections to the \\"beat generation\\" which had, in turn, been inspired by the philosophers, artists and poets of the Paris Existentialist movement which gathered around Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus in the years after World War II. Sartre and Camus were members of Combat, a French resistance group formed in 1942 by Henri Frenay. Frenay, Sartre and Camus were all involved in publishing Underground newspapers for the resistance. The French underground culture which inspired Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg in America in the 1940s was steeped in socialist thinking before the cold war began. This, however, was not the monolithic socialism of the totalitarian Soviet state, but rather the free- thinking and expressive socialism of artists and dreamers attempting to re- think society. Jack Kerouac (In Esquire magazine in 1958) Jack Kerouac (1922-1969) Poems, Terebess Asia Online (TAO) said: :\\"The same thing was almost going on in the postwar France of Sartre and Genet and what's more we knew about it‚ÄîBut as to the actual existence of a Beat Generation, chances are it was really just an idea in our minds‚ÄîWe'd stay up 24 hours drinking cup after cup of black coffee, playing record after record of Wardell Gray, Lester Young, Dexter Gordon, Willie Jackson, Lennie Tristano and all the rest, talking madly about that holy new feeling out there in the streets‚ÄîWe'd write stories about some strange beatific Negro hepcat saint with goatee hitchhiking across Iowa with taped up horn bringing the secret message of blowing to other coasts, other cities, like a veritable Walter the Penniless leading an invisible First Crusade‚ÄîWe had our mystic heroes and wrote, nay sung novels about them, erected long poems celebrating the new 'angels' of the American underground‚ÄîIn actuality there was only a handful of real hip swinging cats and what there was vanished mightily swiftly during the Korean War when (and after) a sinister new kind of efficiency appeared in America, maybe it was the result of the universalization of Television and nothing else (the Polite Total Police Control of Dragnet's 'peace' officers) but the beat characters after 1950 vanished into jails and madhouses, or were shamed into silent conformity, the generation itself was shortlived and small in number.\\" It took a few years more, however, for the culture Kerouac describes to grow in numbers and redefine itself variously as the underground culture or the freak scene etc. See also * Alternative culture * Church of the SubGenius * Counterculture * Cult following * English underground * History of subcultures in the 20th century * Notes from Underground * Prague Underground * Soviet Nonconformist Art * Ukrainian underground * UK Underground * Underground comix * Underground film * Underground Literary Alliance * Underground music * Underground press ReferencesExternal links * Category:Subcultures ","title":"Underground culture"},{"id":"20960316","text":"Sweet 75 is the only studio album by alternative rock band Sweet 75, released on August 26, 1997, through DGC.

The computer program solves numerically a large eddy simulation form of the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations appropriate for low-speed, thermally-driven flow, with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires, to describe the evolution of fire. FDS is free software developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the United States Department of Commerce, in cooperation with VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. Smokeview is the companion visualization program that can be used to display the output of FDS. The first version of FDS was publicly released in February 2000. To date, about half of the applications of the model have been for design of smoke handling systems and sprinkler/detector activation studies. The other half consist of residential and industrial fire reconstructions. Throughout its development, FDS has been aimed at solving practical fire problems in fire protection engineering, while at the same time providing a tool to study fundamental fire dynamics and combustion. The Wildland-Urban Fire Dynamics Simulator (WFDS) is an extension developed by the US Forest Service that is integrated into FDS and allows it to be used for wildfire modeling. It models vegetative fuel either by explicitly defining the volume of the vegetation or, for surface fuels such as grass, by assuming uniform fuel at the air-ground boundary. FDS is a Fortran program that reads input parameters from a text file, computes a numerical solution to the governing equations, and writes user-specified output data to files. Smokeview is a companion program that reads FDS output files and produces animations on the computer screen. Smokeview has a simple menu-driven interface, while FDS does not. However, there are various third-party programs that have been developed to generate the text file containing the input parameters needed by FDS.

Biography  Marina Uspenskaya was born in Moscow in 1925. She graduated from the 1905 Art College, where she studied theatre and decorative arts under professor V.A. Shestakov. In 1947 she entered the graphics department of the Surikov Institute in Moscow, where she studied under professor D.E. Dekhtyaryev in the book illustration studio. Works After graduation she found her passion and craft, making illustrations for children's books. Throughout her career, she made illustrations for some 200 children's books in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Russia, France, India and Japan. She worked for several of the largest publishing houses in her native country, including Detskaya Literatura, Detgiz and Malysh. She is particularly famous for her illustrations for classic Russian fairy tales, including Ruslan and Lyudmila and Silver Hoof. Marina Evgenevna was one of the anchor artists on the children's journal Murzilka from 1958 to the late 1960s. In total, her illustrations have been printed in more than 115 million books and postcards. Marina Evgenevna continued the tradition of her grandfather Vasily Navozov, artist and Academy member, and for many years her life was connected to famous Moscow artist and academician Boris Uspensky. Her art changed over time, but always in her very personal and highly recognisable style. Applying water colour, Indian ink and gouache in warm and gentle colours, her illustrations were detailed, yet have a simple light touch. From the late 1960s onwards, she moved away from her classical realism into a more expressionistic and symbolic world. From the late 1980s she watched, and was inspired by, the changes in everyday life happening in the transition from the Soviet Union to the new Russia. This was, for example, reflected in her colourful images, often in red or orange, of the New Russian Women ‚Äì as she called them ‚Äì which she boldly depicted in scenes from every-day life. Her favourite tool in her later years was the colour pencil, with which she depicted daily life in Moscow, be it in the Moscow metro or evenings at the theatre or the ballet.

Etymology The word palengke is a local variant of the Spanish word ', literally meaning \\"(wooden) palisade or stockade\\" and by extension the area enclosed by such a structure for defense, public festivals or some other purpose. The Spanish word is also used to describe a pathway or cluster of tables set up at some place of gathering such as a theatre, tournament or market, and it is from this latter sense that palengke likely derives its usage in the Filipino context. In the former Spanish colonies of New Spain in the Americas palenque also described a gathering-place of indios. One false etymology for palengke/palenque appearing in some popular sources mistakenly presumes that palenque is instead a word from the indigenous Mayan languages of Central America meaning \\"gathering place\\", and that in colonial times the Spanish adopted it to describe a gathering of indigenous groups. While its use in Latin America to describe such a gathering is attested, the word itself originates from Spanish and not any of the indigenous languages; the mistaken belief of the word's indigenous origin is probably reinforced by Palenque‚Äîthe famous Maya archaeological site in Chiapas, Mexico‚Äîwhich was named after the nearby Spanish village when the site was rediscovered in the mid-18th century. Description A palengke is usually composed of several dozen stalls arranged in rows under a shared roof. Management is usually by the local governmental units whose jurisdiction encompasses the physical location of the markets. Certain pieces of legislation, however, such as the Cooperatives Code (RA 7160) and the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (RA 8435) have prescribed that management of the markets be accomplished through cooperatives. There is little control over the day-to-day management of individual stalls, including commodity pricing. This has resulted in what has been called \\"palengke mechanics\\". A cited example would be the price of chicken during the local 2007 holiday season; lack of demand for the product resulted in prices going up rather than down. It was stated that this was the result of local retailers raising prices to recover financial losses from low demand. The Philippine government retains some control over the price of some commodities sold in palengkes, especially critical foods such as rice. The National Food Authority calls this regulation campaign (specifically for rice), Palengke Watch. Issues The concept has its criticisms, citing several drawbacks. Palengkes have been described as sites where illicit electric and water connections are rampant. In 2002, the Caloocan public market was described by city officials as unsanitary. Some are known to use wells, some illegally constructed, as water sources leading to possibly unsanitary water conditions. Another criticism of the traditional palengke is that it is an old concept that must make way for modern development; a Pasig City mayor once opined that the palengke was outdated. The concept of the palengke is usually taken hand-in-hand with the local concept poverty. Because of this, a few local politicians have used as their nicknames, such as \\"Mr. Palengke\\" (or some iteration) to signify affinity with the masses. Prominent local politician Mar Roxas used the nickname \\"Mr. Palengke\\" to his advantage, gaining a Senate seat in the 2004 Philippine elections. =Competition= In recent years, the typical palengke has been supplanted by larger, more commercialized shopping centers. The rise of shopping malls and supermarkets have also been cited as threats to the old-school public markets. In a 2002 article, the president of the National Federation of Market Vendors Cooperatives, a cooperative of market vendors throughout the country, stated that the concept of the palengke was an integral part of Philippine culture. He stressed that the public market instilled a sense of community that was not evident in the more-commercialized shopping malls. In spite of this, at least one traditional market has been renovated to appeal to more commercialized consumers. A specific case is the \\"Mutya ng Pasig Market\\" which was renovated in late 2008, from a traditional palengke into more of a shopping mall.

The team's title sponsor was Cerv√©lo, a Canadian manufacturer of bicycle frames that previously exclusively supplied . They competed in 2010 as a UCI Professional Continental team, but folded after the season. The team formed in 2008 after Team CSC switched frames effective at the end of that season, to Specialized, after years of success with Cerv√©lo. Their registration as a UCI Professional Continental Team was confirmed on December 2. Earlier that year, Carlos Sastre, then a member of Team CSC Saxo Bank, rode a Cerv√©lo bicycle to victory in the Tour de France. Probably the team's most notable cyclist, Sastre said that being able to continually work with Cerv√©lo to develop bicycle technology played a part in his decision to join the new team. The team's first season was marked by success in one-day races, with several victories and podium finishes, and a rider in the top ten in nearly every race they entered. The team was prolific in winning individual stages in stage races, including in all three Grand Tours of the 2009 season.  Team roster As of August 1, 2010. Team origin The founding of Cerv√©lo TestTeam was a direct reaction to Team CSC Saxo Bank switching to Specialized. A press release issued by the team at the time they were first founded indirectly stated that Specialized had outbid them to become Saxo Bank's new supplier. Sastre and Roger Hammond were two of the first cyclists to be rumored to be joining the new team. Cerv√©lo cofounder Gerard Vroomen has said that bicycle manufacturers have for long not gotten much out of sponsorship and supplier deals with professional teams and that their money was better spent fronting their own team. He approached Sastre two days after the conclusion of the 2008 Tour de France and told him about the new team, at which time Sastre verbally indicated to Vroomen that he would join the team. The other highly prominent cyclist on the squad is former Tour de France green jersey winner Thor Hushovd, who needed a new team following the collapse of after the 2008 season, and brought a number of Cr√©dit Agricole riders to the team after signing. In the six months between the end of the Tour de France and the team's first training camp in Portugal in January 2009, a roster of 25 riders and an entire supporting staff was hired. The team is one of the most broadly international in professional cycling, with 13 nations represented by those 25 riders. At the first presentation of the team in Portugal, Vroomen also evoked legendary cyclist Fausto Coppi having ridden for a team sponsored by the bicycle industry (that sponsor being Bianchi Bicycles) as a motivation for sponsorship of the new team. On February 11, the team was one of thirteen assigned \\"Wild Card\\" status by the UCI, allowing the organizers of UCI ProTour events to select them to race in their event despite not having ProTour status as a team. To date, only the Tour Down Under and the Dauphin√© Lib√©r√© have declined to invite the team. 2009 season Philip Deignan during the 2009 Vuelta a Castilla y Le√≥n. The first UCI event in which the team participated was the 2009 Tour of Qatar from February 1-6, an event in which the team had great success, getting a stage win and also winning the points, team, and youth classifications. The next stage race in which the team got a victory was the 2009 Tour of California, with Hushovd winning a mass sprint finish in the third stage, after Cerv√©lo's leadout train successfully outmaneuvered 's. Haussler took two stage wins later in the month at the 2009 Volta ao Algarve. The team has seen great success in one-day races in 2009, winning Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, the Giro del Mendrisiotto, and the GP Triberg-Schwarzwald. The team entered nearly 20 major one-day races in the spring season in 2009, failing to make at least the top ten in only one, the Gran Premio dell'Insubria. Haussler and Hushovd both made the podium in the 2009 Milan ‚Äì San Remo, narrowly missing out on the top spot to Mark Cavendish after a sprint finish. Haussler been in the lead until the final meters, when he was overtaken by Cavendish, and he appeared quite despondent when talking to reporters after the race. The team's first Grand Tour was the 2009 Giro d'Italia. Sastre was the team's leader in the race, with finishing on the podium his explicit goal. Sastre eventually finished fourth, but the team won four stages, two by Sastre in the high mountains, one by Simon Gerrans from a breakaway, and Ignatas Konovalovas won the Giro's closing individual time trial. While the Giro was ongoing, the team also competed at the 2009 Volta a Catalunya, with Hushovd winning two stages. In the 2009 Tour de France, Hushovd won his second career green jersey, holding off the six stage wins of Mark Cavendish by virtue of a stage win of his own, a penalty assessed to Cavendish in a sprint between the two of them, and a lengthy escape on a mountain stage to claim maximum points in two intermediate sprints. The team got another stage win with Haussler in the Tour's second week. Sastre, on the other hand, had his worst Grand Tour in three years, finishing 17th overall. Media Cerv√©lo TestTeam is featured in the documentary Beyond the Peloton, which detailed the team's origins and its first competitive season. It was released online episodically.

Initially a goods line, it was upgraded in June 1876, when presumably the third platform was added. In 1899 permission was given to quadruple the track between Rugby and Nuneaton. However, with more powerful locomotives coming into use, the work was only partly carried out. The station was next to the B4027 road, with the booking office on the overbridge and covered staircases down to each platform on which passenger facilities were limited to a shelter on the down platform. There were two long sidings, one with a loop which passed through a goods shed.Preston Hendry, R., Powell Hendry, R., (1982) An historical survey of selected LMS stations : layouts and illustrations.

The original idea of The Blues Train was inspired by stories of blues musicians playing music on The Mississippi freight trains. The combination listening to music whilst travelling on a train was a success so it kept running. Each year over 10,000 people run the rails. The Blues Train was founded by Hugo T Armstrong and is run by the team at Bay City Events with the help of the volunteers at the Bellarine Railway who maintain and drive the heritage train. Over the last two decades, The Blues Train has welcomed over one hundred amazing music acts, including solo performers, duos and full bands. The Blues Train travels along 16 km of railway between the towns of Queenscliff and Drysdale, on the Bellarine Peninsula. The train begins and ends the journey in Queenscliff. There are three intervals during the events. The train stops for each interval, the first being Suma Park platform followed by Drysdale Station where the train then turns around to return to Queenscliff via another stop at Suma Park. History The Blues Train began operating in 1993 from the coastal town of Queenscliff. Initially running some one or two services a year, the Blues Train now operates around 40 shows per year. The show is primarily run on a Saturday evening from August to May as well as some Friday evenings in December. Modus The Blues Train experience begins at the historic town of Queenscliff home of the Queenscliff Music Festival). The four-carriage train, drawn by a steam locomotive, departs from Queenscliff railway station after customers have eaten, running around the southern shoreline of Swan Bay through saltmarsh before puffing up the hill to the Bellarine plateau and travelling through grazing country. At each of the three stops, Suma Park, Drysdale and Suma Park again, passengers swap carriages to hear another of the four blues acts performing on the train. Drinks are available from a mobile bar in a converted guard's van. At Drysdale the train reverses direction and returns to Queenscliff. Acts The Blues Train has hosted a range of blues acts including Chris Wilson (Australian musician), Jimi Hocking, Claude Hay, Ezra Lee (musician) and other blues acts.

It is one of ten short plays that make up Tonight at 8.30, a cycle written to be performed in groups of three plays across three evenings. The original production, starring Coward and Gertrude Lawrence played in a pre-London tour, and then the West End, and finally New York, in 1935‚Äì1937. Red Peppers has been revived periodically and has been adapted for the cinema and television. The play depicts a second-rate music hall double act, a husband and wife team, who perform two musical numbers, in between which they bicker in their dressing room and quarrel with colleagues. Background In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Coward wrote a succession of hits, ranging from the operetta Bitter Sweet (1929) and the epic Cavalcade (1931), requiring a large cast, gargantuan sets and a complex hydraulic stage, to the intimate comedies Private Lives (1930), in which Coward starred alongside Gertrude Lawrence, and Design for Living (1932).Hoare, p. 249 Coward said that after Private Lives, he felt that the public enjoyed seeing him and Lawrence together on stage, and so he wrote the play cycle Tonight at 8.30 as \\"acting, singing, and dancing vehicles for Gertrude Lawrence and myself\\".Hoare, pp. 268‚Äì270 In the programme for the London run Coward wrote: All the plays in the cycle starred Coward and Gertrude Lawrence. Coward directed the plays and wrote the words and music for songs in four of them. In this play, billed as \\"an interlude with music\\", Coward and Lawrence's characters, George and Lily Pepper, sing the comic duets, \\"Has Anybody Seen Our Ship?\\" and \\"Men About Town\\".Mander and Mitchenson, p. 295 First performances Red Peppers was the third of the Tonight at 8.30 cycle to be presented. It opened at the Opera House, Manchester on 15 October 1935, preceded by two other plays from Tonight at 8.30: We Were Dancing and The Astonished Heart.\\"Theatres\\", The Manchester Guardian, 16 October 1935, p. 11 Tonight at 8.30 opened in London on 9 January 1936 at the Phoenix Theatre,\\"Phoenix Theatre\\", The Times, 10 January 1936, p. 10 In the first programme of three plays, Red Peppers concluded the evening, preceded by Family Album and The Astonished Heart.Parker, p. 21 After a try- out in Boston, the Broadway opening took place on 24 November 1936 at the National Theatre, again starring Coward and Lawrence. Red Peppers was included in the second of the three programmes in the cycle, along with The Astonished Heart and Hands Across the Sea.\\"Tonight at 8:30\\", Internet Broadway Database.

They are seen first onstage, and then in their dressing room, and finally onstage again. They begin in a comedy number, dressed as naval ratings, singing \\"Has Anybody Seen our Ship?\\" ‚Äì two sailors after a spree: :We've lost our way :And we've lost our pay, :And to make the thing complete, :We've been and gone and lost the bloomin' fleet! Their exit dance is marred when Lily drops her telescope and stops to retrieve it before hurrying after George. In their dressing room they argue as they get ready for their second slot. While the next act is on stage ‚Äì a non-musical number by a fading West End actress, Mabel Grace ‚Äì the Peppers receive a visit from the theatre's musical director, Bert Bentley, who asks them to speed up their sailor number. Lily, who blames his over-brisk tempo for her mishap with the telescope, is incensed and a loud row ensues. It is broken off when the call- boy warns Bentley that he is due back in the orchestra pit. The scene ends with a blackout. The lights come up again revealing the Peppers getting into their white ties and tails for their second number. The theatre manager enters, clearly briefed by Bentley, and a further row develops, interrupted by Mabel Grace complaining of the noise. The tumult is interrupted by the call boy who summons the Peppers for their second number. The curtain falls, and then rises on George and Lily's \\"dude\\" number. Their song goes well enough, but for the tap-dance with which the act ends, Bentley vengefully increases the tempo to an impossible speed, George slips and falls and Lily hurls her top hat at Bentley, shouting, \\"You great drunken fool!\\". The curtain falls \\"amid discord\\".Coward, p. 80 Revivals and adaptations Red Peppers has been revived as part of complete, or near-complete cycles of Tonight at 8.30 by the Antaeus Company in Los Angeles in 2007, the Shaw Festival, Canada, in 2009,Belcher, David. \\"Brushing Up Their Coward in Canada\\".

The Phoenix Theatre Orchestra was conducted by Clifford Greenwood. The recording has been reissued on LP, CD and online.Rust and Debus, p. 415 Critical reception Coward wrote of the piece, \\"Red Peppers is a vaudeville sketch sandwiched in between two parodies of music hall songs. We always enjoyed playing it and the public always enjoyed watching us play it, which, of course, was highly satisfactory\\".Mander and Mitchenson, p.296 Coward's friend and confidante Lynn Fontanne, who had commented adversely on We Were Dancing, was much more taken with Red Peppers, finding it \\"very fine and very funny. Their utter third- ratedness is so awfully pathetic. You know exactly why (aside from the pitiful business of their act) they have never been and never could be successful.\\"Quoted in Day, p. xii At the time of the first production, both The Times and The Daily Mail thought Red Peppers the most successful of the plays in the cycle.Morley, p. 66 The critic Charles Morgan wrote, \\"The theatrical success of the evening belongs without question to Red Peppers ‚Ä¶ Here, with quarrels and back-chat, Mr Coward the dramatist is comfortably within his range, and Mr Coward the actor, and above all the dancer, knows how, with Miss Lawrence, to make the most of his own swift nonsense.\\"Morgan, p. 164 NotesReferences   * External links *Photo from Red Peppers at musicals101.com Category:Plays by No√´l Coward Category:1935 plays ","title":"Red Peppers"},{"id":"20960561","text":"Pippi Longstocking is the titular fictional character in a series of children's books by Swedish author Astrid Lindgren.

He was musical director for The March of Time newsreel series. Early life and career Shaindlin was born in Karasubazar, Crimea (at the time part of the Russian Empire) on April 14, 1909 to Chaim and Rachel (Golden). His father owned and operated a coal business and was possibly shot and killed during a robbery of his business. Shaindlin came to North America, via Istanbul, on December 8, 1922 and entered the U.S. under the name Jacob Scheindlin. Shaindlin began his musical career as a pianist in silent movie halls, having relocated to the United States as a young boy (Chicago) along with his mother and brother Leo by winning a music scholarship/piano competition in Russia. He became a naturalized US citizen July 28, 1934. In the late 1940s he was musical director of the Carnegie Pops Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. He was cited by President Truman for his war contributions for his work on the documentary Tanks. He was the founder and President of Triumph Publications, Inc. of New York City, an extensive and progressive commercial sound music recording library with affiliation to BMI. He scored numerous television and cartoon music, including such classic favorites as Deputy Dawg, Rocky and Bulwinkle, Father Knows Best and The Cisco Kid. He also composed the 1951 fanfare for Screen Gems used from 1951http://www.classicthemes.com/studioLogos.shtml He was Musical Director of the Arthur Penn feature film Mickey One, starring Warren Beatty and with musical features by saxophonist Stan Getz. Shaindlin also directed a number of significant documentaries, ranging in scope from travel themes to education, health and Hollywood. Their offices were located in New York City on West 60th Street between Columbus Circle and Eighth Avenue. He collaborated with famed entertainer Gypsy Rose Lee late in her career to produce a musical review in which she intended to star in New York at the El Morocco nightclub, which in the end did not materialize, reportedly due to her health issues. Upon formal retirement in the early 1970s he became a musical consultant to Madison Square Garden. He is the father of Daniel Shaindlin, former operatic tenor and founder of Concert Opera of Manhattan, noted vocal teacher and music director, and artistic director of The Refuge, a theatre company in San Francisco, California. Conductor Shaindlin is in some respects better known today as the conductor of two scores composed by Morton Gould for Cinerama Holiday (1954), the second Cinerama production, and Windjammer (1958), the first (and only) film produced in the rival Cinemiracle format. The original soundtrack albums from these films were released on Mercury Records and Columbia Records, respectively. In popular culture The songs \\"I'm Tickled Pink\\" and \\"Let's Go Sunning\\" are featured in-game \\"Galaxy News Radio\\" station in the 2008 video game Fallout 3.http://www.soundtrackcollector.com./catalog/composerdetail.php?composerid=4244 \\"Let's Go Sunning\\" was used in the February 11, 2012 episode of Saturday Night Live during the \\"Bein' Quirky with Zooey Deschanel\\" comedy sketch. Due to an error, the song was misattributed to the late Cass Elliot in the sketch. The song was additionally featured in a trailer for the 2005 video game Destroy All Humans!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcTF3GUXq1g Also, the opening and closing theme of the TV series Adventures of Superman is accredited to Leon Klatzkin. For some reason, despite the Los Angeles Times listing his many compositions for television shows, some people think Klatzkin was not a composer, but a Mutel employee, a film cutter who helped film editors select appropriate tracks for their pictures and that Shaindlin may have composed the music. The song \\"Let's Go Sunning\\" is used anachronistically in the episode \\"The Good Listener\\" of Boardwalk Empire's fifth season, set in 1931. It is audible when Nelson Van Alden's son is asking him a question for his science class. \\"Let's Go Sunning\\" is also used in the 2019 TV Show Doom Patrol, where it is heard coming from the room of Rita Farr after she opens the door. The song \\"Arizona Fanfare\\" is used in SpongeBob SquarePants associated with Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Additionally, the song \\"Verve\\" plays on Plankton's record player in the episode of the same name.

The original Brandon station was built by the London and Birmingham Railway and was the only one between Coventry and Rugby. It was replaced by a new station nearby, Brandon and Wolston, in 1879.Preston Hendry, R., Powell Hendry, R., (1982) An historical survey of selected LMS stations : layouts and illustrations. Vol. 1 Oxford Publishing There were small sidings on each side of the double track, with a goods shed on the up. For each, until 1903, there were wagon turntables, with track between them passing at right angles across the running lines. Although this was a common arrangement for small wayside stations, the LNWR had removed them elsewhere before 1880. At grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway. There was a fairly substantial timber-built booking office on the up platform, and a footbridge, as was required by the Inspector of Railways for stations built at that late date. The LNWR provided only five trains a day in each direction, less than a third for stations at that time and in that area. By 1938 the LMS was providing about a dozen trains a day but this trade virtually disappeared after the war. The station never generated a great deal of business and was closed on 4 September 1960. The signal cabin which had survived, possibly since 1879, was closed when Rugby power box was opened in September 1964.

It claims to be the world's first organization that represents the Sahajdhari Sikhs. Dr. Paramjeet Singh Ranu is the founder National President of the Party.].Sehajdhari Sikhs back Cong. The Times of India, 20 April 2004.  Mission  SSP aims to spread the teachings and principles of Guru Nanak Dev and the other Sikh Gurus with the preaching of Guru Granth Sahib, to \\"spread the Message of Peace worldwide\\". It also aims to \\"prevent the fascist forces to divide the religion or the nation on caste basis\\".  History  Sehajdhari Sikh Federation was formed on 13 April 2001 by holding Ardas at Gurudwara Tahliana Sahib Raekot by certain likeminded secular persons especially those Sikhs who were born in Sikh families, when resolutions were passed by SGPC to disfranchise the voting right of Sehajdhari Sikhs in SGPC elections. Firstly the organization was registered under the Society Act at Ludhiana and then on November 4, 2001, the Federation held a large congregation of thousands of Sehajdhari Sikhs before Akal Takht at Amritsar and held Ardas by turning the Sehajdhari Sikh Federation into a political out fit and named it as Sehajdhari Shiromani Akali Dal SSAD. Later an application was filed with the Election Commission of India for getting the organization registered as a Political Party under section 29(A) of the Representation of the People Act 1951. The Akali Dals in Punjab opposed the name ‚ÄúSehajdhari Shiromani Akali Dal‚Äù and the Election Commission directed to change the words ‚ÄòShiromani‚Äô and ‚ÄòAkali‚Äô from the title. As the word ‚ÄòAKALI‚Äô means ‚ÄòKHALSA‚Äô(Amritdhari) and Sehajdharis are not Khalsa hence the old name was selected by the National Council of the Organisation and the Election Commission of India registered the name of ‚ÄúSehajdhari Sikh Federation‚Äù as a Political Party under section 29(A) of the Representation of People Act 1951.Now the Election commission has approved the change of name of the Party as SEHAJDHARI SIKH PARTY (SSP). The Party has been contesting a legal battle in the Punjab & Haryana High Court for the voting right of Sehajdhari Sikhs in the SGPC elections which was existing since 1959 and was disfrenchised in 2003 by a notification. The High Court quashed the notification and revived the voting rights of sehajdhari sikhs. The SGPC filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the High Court Verdict and the matter is under adjudication.

Biography Barrett-Hamilton was born in India of Irish parents, who returned and settled at Kilmanock in County Wexford when the boy was three years old. He was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge, spending summer holidays botanising at home under the encouragement of A. G. More. He held a commission in the 5th (Militia) Battalion of the Royal Irish Rifles, where he was appointed captain on 3 March 1897.

He later worked in the Natural History Museum, London, and worked on various Government investigations. He married Maud Charlotte Eland, of Ireland. They had six children. In his work as a natural historian, he described a great number of new species of small mammal on the islands around the British Isles, notably the house mice and field mice of St. Kilda which he called Mus muralis and Mus hirtensis, believing that these had evolved in situ having colonised the islands naturally via land or ice-bridges. Although this has been demonstrated to be wrong, and many of his described species are now regarded as island forms rather than species in their own right, his contribution to natural history was enormous. He was a valued contributor to the Irish Naturalist journal. His papers and correspondence are held at the University of Manitoba.G.E.H.

This correspondence was begun thanks to Constantijn Huygens, who later joined the correspondence, as did Descartes, of whom Ban was a great admirer. Ban also wrote a Dissertio epistolica de musicae natura in 1637 on musical evolution and 'musica flexanima' (melodic intervals and their emotional effects), sending copies to his correspondents. Ban sent Mersenne some of his compositions and, though the latter criticised them heavily and though Mersenne later weighted a musical competition between Ban and Antoine Bo√´sset in favour of the latter, he and Ban continued to correspond. He also corresponded with P. C. Hooft and later Joost van den Vondel wrote a poem in honor of his compositions that were published in 1642 under the title Zangh- Bloemzel Van Ioan Albert Ban Haerlemmer, Dat is, Staeltjes van den zinroerenden zangh, Met dry stemmen, En den Gemeene-Grondstem.

Most of the holdings of Hermann II, Count Palatine fell back to the emperor, when Hermann died without successor. The emperor named Henry count palatine of the Rhine and during the emperor's trip to Italy tasked Henry to hold interim judicial councils.

Polytechnique and the Armenian Academy of Sciences, Milan, OEMME Edizioni; 1989 It is a large and well-preserved structure dating probably from the fifth or sixth centuries.Cuneo, P. 'La basilique de Tsitsernavank (Cicernavank) dans le Karabagh,' Revue des Etudes Armeniennes It stands not far from the so-called Lachin Corridor, a territory that connects Armenia with the Nagorno Karabakh Republic. The word Tzitzernavank originates from the root \\"tzitzern\\" (Armenian: ’Æ’´’Æ’•’º’∂) meaning \\"little finger\\" in Old Armenian. This points to a period in the history of the monastery when it was believed to contain relics of St. George the Dragon- Slayer. In the past, the monastery belonged to the Tatev eparchy and is mentioned as a notable religious center by the 13th-century historian Stephanos Orbelian (Armenian: ’ç’©’•÷É’°’∂’∏’Ω ’ï÷Ä’¢’•’¨’µ’°’∂) and Bishop Tovma Vanandetsi (Armenian: ‘π’∏’æ’¥’° ’é’°’∂’°’∂’§’•÷Å’´) in 1655.Samvel Karapetian.

Tzitzernavank is an active monastery of the Armenian Apostolic Church. Gtichavank Monastery, 13th century, Nagorno Karabakh Churches with a cupola built on a radiating or cruciform floor plan were numerous in Armenia during the seventh century, and are well represented in Artsakh.Shahen Mkrtchian.

Moscow, Incombook, 2000, p. 22 One example is the chapel at Vankasar (Armenian: ’é’°’∂÷Ñ’°’Ω’°÷Ä) where the cupola and its drum rest on the central square of a cruciform floor plan. The chapel is located on the eastern frontier of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic, and was reputedly founded by Artsakh's celebrated monarch Vachagan II the Pious (Armenian: ’é’°’π’°’£’°’∂ ‘≤ ‘≤’°÷Ä’•’∫’°’∑’ø) of the early medieval Arranshahik dynasty (Armenian: ‘±’º’°’∂’∑’°’∞’´’Ø). Another example is the Okhta Trne church at Mokhrenes (Armenian: ’ï’≠’ø’® ’è’º’∂’ß, \\"The Eight-Door Church\\"), probably dating from the fifth to seventh centuries.Murad Hasratian. Early Modern Christian Architecture of Armenia. Moscow, Incombook, 2000, p. 53 Its walls, roughly cut and bonded, enclose a quatrefoil interior with four small diagonal niches. Less common is the free cross plan with a cupola, found in the Chapel of St. Savior (Armenian: ’ç’¢. ’ì÷Ä’Ø’´’π) in the Mardakert District. Artsakh's designs at times differed from the course of the architectural evolution of mainland Armenia. Observations suggest that certain floor plans frequently employed in other regions of Armenia during the seventh century are not found in Artsakh. These include the chamber with a cupola supported by wall braces (e.g. the cathedral in Aruj, in the Aragatsotn Province of Armenia); the cruciform plan with a cupola on four free-standing pillars (e.g. St. Gayaneh Church in the Holy City of Echmiadzin, Armenia), and the radiating type with four rooms in a rectangle (e.g. St. Hripsimeh Church in the Holy City of Echmiadzin, Armenia).Jean-Michel Thierry. Eglises et Couvents du Karabagh, Antelais: Lebanon, 1991, p. 121 Church of St. Grigoris of the Amaras Monastery Another peculiarity of the region is that few of Artsakh's monuments date from the post-Arab period or the rise of Armenian kingdoms (ninth to the eleventh centuries), which was a very productive artistic era in other Armenian provinces. The structures that could be attributed to that period are chapels on the cruciform plan with a cupola, such as the church at Varazgom (Armenian: ’é’°÷Ä’°’¶’£’∏’¥) near Kashatagh, the Khunisavank Monastery (Armenian: ‘Ω’∏÷Ç’∂’´’Ω’°’æ’°’∂÷Ñ) in Getabaks (now‚ÄìGedabey district of Azerbaijan, north to the Nagorno Karabakh Republic), and churches with a single nave, such as the church in Parissos (Armenian: ’ì’°÷Ä’´’Ω’∏’Ω).Jean- Michel Thierry. Eglises et Couvents du Karabagh, Antelais: Lebanon, 1991, p. 87 It was during the post-Seljuk period and the beginning of the Mongol period (late twelfth and thirteenth centuries) when Artsakh's architecture blossomed. Monasteries in this era served as active centers of art and scholarship. Most of them contained scriptoria where manuscripts were copied and illuminated. They also were fortified and often served as places of refuge for the population in times of trouble.Tom Masters, Richard Plunkett. Georgia, Armenia & Azerbaijan (Lonely Planet Travel Guides). Lonely Planet Publications; 2 edition (July 2004). , Chapter: Nagorno Karabakh Several monastic churches from this period adopted the model used most widely throughout Armenia: a cathedral with a cupola in the inscribed cross plan with two or four angular chambers. Examples include the largest and most complex monasteries of Artsakh: Dadivank (Armenian: ‘¥’°’§’´’æ’°’∂÷Ñ, 1214‚Äì1237), Gandzasar (Armenian: ‘≥’°’∂’±’°’Ω’°÷Ä, 1216‚Äì1238) and Gtichavank (Armenian: ‘≥’ø’´’π’°’æ’°’∂÷Ñ, 1241‚Äì1246). In the case of the Gandzasar and Gtichavank monasteries, the cone over the cupola is umbrella-shaped, a picturesque design that was originally developed by the architects of Armenia's former capital city of Ani, in the tenth century, and subsequently spread to other provinces of the country, including Artsakh.Volume 17: Gandzasar.

Polytechnique and the Armenian Academy of Sciences, Milan, OEMME Edizioni; 1987, , p. 14 The famous 13th century Armenian-inscribed double khachkars of the Memorial Bell-Tower of the Dadivank Monastery Like all Armenian monasteries, those in Artsakh reveal great geometric rigor in the layout of buildings. In this regard, the thirteenth century's Dadivank, the largest monastic complex in Artsakh and all of Eastern Armenia, located in the northwestern corner of the Mardakert District, is a remarkable case. Dadivank was sufficiently well preserved to leave no doubt that it was one of the most complete monasteries in the entire Caucasus. With its Memorial Cathedral of the Holy Virgin in the center, Dadivank has approximately twenty different structures, which are divided into four groups: ecclesiastical, residential, defensive and ancillary.Nicholas Holding.

Some appear as simple vaulted galleries open to the south (e.g. in the Metz Arrank Monastery; Armenian: ’Ñ’•’Æ’°’º’°’∂’´÷Å ’é’°’∂÷Ñ); others have an asymmetrical vaulted room with pillars (Gtichavank Monastery); or feature a quadrangular room with four central pillars supporting a pyramidal dome (the Dadivank Monastery).

Polytechnique and the Armenian Academy of Sciences, Milan, OEMME Edizioni; 1968 Although in this period the focus in Artsakh shifted to more complex structures, churches with a single nave continued to be built in large numbers. One example is the monastery of St. Yeghishe Arakyal (Armenian: ’ç’¢. ‘µ’≤’´’∑’• ‘±’º’°÷Ñ’µ’°’¨, also known as the Jrvshtik Monastery (’ã÷Ä’æ’∑’ø’´’Ø), which in Armenian means \\"Longing-for-Water\\"), in the historical county of Jraberd, that has eight single-naved chapels aligned from north to south. One of these chapels is a site of high importance for the Armenians, as it serves as a burial ground for Artsakh's fifth-century monarch King Vachagan II the Pious Arranshahik. Also known as Vachagan the Pious for his devotion to the Christian faith and support in building a large number of churches throughout the region, King Vachagan is an epic figure whose deeds are immortalized in many of Artsakh's legends and fairytales. The most famous of those tells how Vachagan fell in love with the beautiful and clever Anahit, who then helped the young king defeat pagan invaders.Robert D San Souci (Author), Raul Colon (Illustrator). Weave Of Words. An Armenian Tale Retold, Orchard Books, 1998 After an interruption that lasted from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries, architecture flourished again, in the seventeenth century. Many parish churches were built, and the monasteries, serving as bastions of spiritual, cultural and scholarly life, were restored and enlarged. The most notable of those is the Yerits Mankants Monastery (\\"Monastery of Three Infants,\\" Armenian: ‘µ÷Ä’´÷Å ’Ñ’°’∂’Ø’°’∂÷Å ’é’°’∂÷Ñ) that was built around 1691 in the county of Jraberd.

Paradise Laid Waste: A Journey to Karabakh, Lingvist Publishers, Moscow, 1998, chapter: Monastery of the Three Youths Artsakh's architecture of the nineteenth century is distinguished by a merger of innovation and the tradition of grand national monuments of the past. One example is the Cathedral of the Holy Savior also known as \\"Ghazanchetsots\\" (Armenian: ’Ç’°’¶’°’∂’π’•÷Å’∏÷Å ’ç’¢. ‘±’¥’•’∂’°÷É÷Ä’Ø’´’π, 1868‚Äì1888) because it was erected in the historical Ghazanchetsots (’Ç’°’¶’°’∂’π’•÷Å’∏÷Å) borough of Shusha. It stands in Shusha, former capital of Karabakh Khanate and is among the largest Armenian churches ever erected. The cathedral's architectural forms were influenced by the designs of the ancient cathedral of St. Echmiadzin (4th-9th centuries), center of the Armenian Apostolic Church located to the west of Armenia's capital of Yerevan. After the Karabakh War, the Cathedral underwent restoration, and currently serves as an active house of worship of the Armenian Apostolic Church. In addition to the Cathedral of the Holy Savior, Shusha hosted the Hermitage of Holy Virgins (Armenian: ‘ø’∏÷Ç’Ω’°’∂’°÷Å ‘±’∂’°’∫’°’ø, 1816) and three other Armenian churches: Holy Savior \\"Meghretsots\\" (Armenian: ’Ñ’•’≤÷Ä’•÷Å’∏÷Å ’ç’¢. ‘±’¥’•’∂’°÷É÷Ä’Ø’´’π, 1838), St. Hovhannes \\"Kanach Zham\\" (Armenian: ’ç’¢. ’Ä’∏’æ’∞’°’∂’∂’•’Ω, 1847) and Holy Savior \\"Aguletsots\\" (Armenian: ‘±’£’∏÷Ç’¨’•÷Å’∏÷Å ’ç’¢. ‘±’¥’•’∂’°÷É÷Ä’Ø’´’π, 1882).Armenia & Karabagh.

They are linked to the emergence of the Karabakh Khanate, a short-lived, Muslim-ruled principality in Karabakh (1750s-1805). In the city of Shusha, three nineteenth-century mosques were built, which, together with two Russian Orthodox chapels, are the only non-Armenian architectural monuments found on the territories comprising the former Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Region and today's Nagorno Karabakh Republic.  Monuments of civil architecture  From the 17th and 18th centuries, several palaces of Armenian meliks (Armenian: ’¥’•’¨’´÷Ñ, duke) should be noted, especially the Palace of the Melik-Beglarian (Armenian: ’Ñ’•’¨÷Ñ-‘≤’•’£’¨’°÷Ä’µ’°’∂) family in Giulistan (in the Shahumian District), Palace of the Melik-Avanian (Armenian: ’Ñ’•’¨÷Ñ-‘±’æ’°’∂’µ’°’∂) family in Togh (in the Hadrut District), Palace of the Melik-Mnatzakanian (Armenian: ’Ñ’•’¨÷Ñ- ’Ñ’∂’°÷Å’°’Ø’°’∂’µ’°’∂) family in Getashen, Palace of the Melik-Haikazian (Armenian: ’Ñ’•’¨’´÷Ñ-’Ä’°’µ’Ø’°’¶’µ’°’∂) family in Kashatagh (in the Kashatagh-Lachin District), Palace of the Melik-Dolukhanian (Armenian: ’Ñ’•’¨÷Ñ-‘¥’∏’¨’∏÷Ç’≠’°’∂’µ’°’∂) family in Tukhnakal (near Stepanakert) and, finally, Palace of the Khan of Karabakh in the city of Shusha.Boris Baratov.

Chapter: Hadrut-Fizuli Before its destruction in 1920 the main repository of the region's civil architecture was Shusha. In the late 19th century, Shusha became one of the largest cities in Caucasus. In 1913, it hosted more than 42,000 people. Shusha's architecture had its unique style and spirit. That special style synthesized designs used in building grand homes in Artsakh's rural areas (especially in the southern county of Dizak) and elements of neo-classical European architecture. The quintessential example of Shusha's residential dwellings is the house of the Avanesantz family (19th century). Shusha's administrative buildings of note include: Royal College (1875), Eparchial College (1838), Technical School (1881) summer and winter clubs of the City Hall (1896 and 1901), The Zhamharian Hospital (1900), The Khandamirian Theater (1891), The Holy Virgin Women's College (1864) and Mariam Ghukassian Nobility High School (1894). Of these buildings, only Royal College and the Zhamharian Hospital survived the Turko-Muslim attack on the city in 1920.Shahen Mkrtchian.

Northern Artsakh. Yerevan: Gitutiun Publishing House, 2004  History of vandalism and destruction  The first record of damage to historical monuments occurred during the early medieval period. During the Armenian-Persian war of 451-484 AD, the Amaras Monastery was wrecked by Persian conquerors who sought to bring pagan practices back to Armenia. Later, In 821, Armenia was overrun by Arabs, and Amaras was plundered. In the same century, however, the monastery was rebuilt under the patronage of Prince Yesai (Armenian: ‘µ’Ω’°’µ’´ ‘ª’∑’≠’°’∂ ‘±’º’°’∂’∑’°’∞’´’Ø), Lord of Dizak, who bravely fought against the invaders. In 1223, as testified by the Bishop Stephanos Orbelian (died in 1304), Amaras was looted again‚Äîat this time, by the Mongols‚Äîwho took with them St. Grigoris' crosier and a large golden cross decorated with 36 precious stones. According to Orbelian, the wife of the Mongolian leader, Byzantine Princess Despina, proposed to send the cross and the crosier to Constantinople.–°—Ç–µ–ø–∞–Ω–æ—Å –û—Ä–±–µ–ª—è–Ω, \\"–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –°–∏—Å–∞–∫–∞–Ω\\", –¢–∏—Ñ–ª–∏—Å, 1910 In 1387, Amaras and ten other monasteries of Artsakh were attacked by Tamerlane's hordes from Central Asia. According to a local Armenian legend, Tamerlane destroyed Amaras and ordered his soldiers to make up a miles-long line from the monastery all the way to the River Arax. Tamerlane's soldiers were passing on the stones of the demolished buildings from one person to another and throwing them into the water to form a bridge. But as soon as the conquerors left the region, the legend says, the region's inhabitants rushed to the river, brought the stones back and rebuilt the monastery to its original state. It must have been at that time when Amaras' famous scriptorium was established.–°—Ç–µ–ø–∞–Ω –õ–∏—Å–∏—Ü—è–Ω. –ê—Ä–º—è–Ω–µ –ù–∞–≥–æ—Ä–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ö–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ö–∞. –ï—Ä–µ–≤–∞–Ω. 1992 Shortly after the Armenian Genocide and the end of the Caucasus Campaign in 1918, a Pogrom instigated by the Muslim Azerbaijani Population in 1920 resulted in the destruction of the entire Armenian quarter of the city, which had a devastating effect on cities architecture heritage and position as a major trade city and producer of silk in the 19th century. After the entry of Turko-Islamic nomads to Karabakh's highlands in the 1750s, the city became divided into two parts: Armenian and Muslim.

However, during the early 20th century the cities cosmopolitan and tolerant attitude began to fall apart, and became a venue of sporadic inter-communal violence, but it was in March 1920 when it received the deadliest blow of all.

Kaufman, p.51 The city's three out of five Armenian churches were totally destroyed by the Turkic bands: Holy Savior \\"Meghretzotz\\" (Armenian: ’Ñ’•’≤÷Ä’•÷Å’∏÷Å ’ç’¢. ’ì÷Ä’Ø’´’π, built in 1838), Holy Savior \\"Aguletzotz\\" (Armenian: ‘±’£’∏÷Ç’¨’•÷Å’∏÷Å ’ç’¢. ’ì÷Ä’Ø’´’π, built in 1882) and Hermitage of Holy Virgins (Armenian: ‘ø’∏÷Ç’Ω’°’∂’°÷Å ‘±’∂’°’∫’°’ø, built in 1816).Caroline Cox (January 1997). \\"Nagorno Karabakh: forgotten people in a forgotten war\\". Contemporary Review. \\"For example, also in the 1920s, Azeris brutally massacred and evicted Armenians from the town of Shusha, which had been a famous and historic centre of Armenian culture\\" The Cathedral of the Holy Savior (1868‚Äì1888) was desecrated and severely damaged. With as many as 7,000 buildings demolished, Shusha has never been restored to its former grandeur. Instead, it shrank, becoming a small town populated by Azerbaijanis(14 thousand residents in 1987 versus 42 thousand in 1913). It stood in ruins from 1920 up to the mid-1960s, when the ruins of the city's Armenian half were bulldozed by orders from Baku and cheaply built apartment complexes were built on top of them. The Karabakh War (1991-1994) likewise left its deep scars on the architectural face of Nagorno Karabakh. The Azerbaijani Army intentionally targeted Armenian Christian monuments for the purpose of their demolition, using, among a variety of means, heavy artillery and military airplanes. Both Amaras and Gandzasar monasteries suffered in the process.Armenia & Karabagh. Stone Garden Productions; 2nd edition (September 1, 2006). p. 267, Robert Bevan writes: \\"The Azeri campaign against the Armenian enclave of Nagorno Karabakh which began in 1988 was accompanied by cultural cleansing that destroyed the Egheazar monastery and 21 other churches.\\"Robert Bevan. The Destruction of Memory: Architecture at War. Reaktion Books. 2006, p. 57 Two out of the three mosques in the city of Shusha also suffered during the war when Armenian forces captured the town in 1992. The authorities of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic, however, are restoring at least one of the mosques, reportedly with some help from Iranian architects.  Fortresses, castles and princely palaces  The fortresses of the region (called \\"berd\\" in Armenian; ’¢’•÷Ä’§) were usually built on hard-to-reach rocks or on the tips of mountains,using the rugged and heavily forested terrain of the region. Some of the fortresses in Nagorno Karabakh include Jraberd (Armenian: ’ã÷Ä’°’¢’•÷Ä’§), Handaberd (Armenian: ’Ä’°’∂’§’°’¢’•÷Ä’§), Kachaghakaberd (Armenian: ‘ø’°’π’°’≤’°’Ø’°’¢’•÷Ä’§), Shikakar (Armenian: ’á’´’Ø’°÷Ñ’°÷Ä), Giulistan (Armenian: ‘≥’µ’∏÷Ç’¨’´’Ω’ø’°’∂), Mairaberd (Armenian: ’Ñ’°’µ÷Ä’°’¢’•÷Ä’§), Toghaberd (Armenian: ’è’∏’≤’°’¢’•÷Ä’§), Aknaberd (Armenian: ‘±’Ø’∂’°’¢’•÷Ä’§), and Aghjkaberd (Armenian: ‘±’≤’ª’Ø’°’¢’•÷Ä’§). These Castles belonged to Artsakh's aristocratic families, safeguarding their domains against foreign invaders that came from the eastern steppes. The forts were established very early in the history of the region, and each successive generation of their custodians contributed to their improvement.Boris Baratov. Paradise Laid Waste: A Journey to Karabakh, Lingvist Publishers, Moscow, 1998, pp. 50 When the Principality of Khachen forged ties with the Kingdom of Cilicia (1080‚Äì1375), an independent Armenian state on the Mediterranean Sea that aided the Crusaders, a small number of Artsakh's fortifications acquired a certain Cilician look as a result.Robert Edwards.

Kirakos Gandzaketsi's history of the Armenians (New York: Sources of the Armenian Tradition, 1986). Gandzaketsi tells the story of friendship between Hetum, King of Cilicia, and Hasan Jalal, Prince of Khachen The Handaberd Castle, the traditional stronghold of the Vakhtangian-Dopian Princes located in Karvachar (Armenian: ’î’°÷Ä’æ’°’≥’°’º, Azerbaijan's former district of Kelbajar), was rebuilt with a grant received from Cilicia's King Levon I; for that it was also known as \\"Levonaberd\\" (Armenian: ‘º÷á’∏’∂’°’¢’•÷Ä’§). Karabakh's most remarkable pieces of fortifications, though, are the Citadel of Shusha and Askeran Fortress. Backed by an intricate system of camps, recruiting centers, watchtowers and fortified beacons, both belonged to the so-called Lesser Syghnakh (Armenian: ’ì’∏÷Ñ÷Ä ’ç’≤’∂’°’≠), which was one of Artsakh's two main historical military districts responsible for defending the southern counties of Varanda and Dizak.George A.

When the Citadel of Shusha was founded by Panah Ali Khan Javanshir, the founder of the Karabakh Khanate, its walls and other fortifications were built.Mirza Adigozel-bek, Karabakh-name (1845)Mirza Jamal Javanshir (1847), History of Karabakh  Khachkars  A large 13th century Armenian-inscribed khachkar outside of the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist, Gandzasar Monastery Khachkars (Armenian: ’≠’°’π÷Ñ’°÷Ä), stone slab monuments decorated with a cross, represent a special chapter in the history of sculpture, and are unique to historical Armenia.Anatoli L. Yakobson. Armenian Khachkars, Moscow, 1986 In the first stage of their evolution, this type of monuments already existed in Artsakh, as attested by one of the earliest dated samples found on the eastern shore of the Lake Sevan (at Metz Mazra, year 881) which at that time was part of the dominion of Artsakh's Princes of Tzar. A very large number of khachkars is also found on the territory of today's Nagorno Karabakh Republic and adjacent regions. Several thirteenth-century examples look particularly refined, and a few of them deserve a special attention for their superior design. The two khachkars of the Gtichavank Monastery (Armenian: ‘≥’ø’´’π’°’æ’°’∂÷Ñ) dating from about 1246 (one of which is preserved at St. Echmiadzin in Armenia), show the two bishops who founded Gtichavank. There are also the two tall khachkar plaques placed inside the Memorial Bell-Tower at the Dadivank Monastery (1283), which are veritable laceworks in stone.Jean-Michel Thierry and Patrick Donabedian. Les arts arm√©niens, Paris, 1987. p. 231 Artsakh's most well-known example of embedded khachkars‚Äîwhere khachkars standing next to each other form some kind of hooded iconostas-in-stone‚Äîis the Bri Yeghtze Monastery (Armenian: ‘≤’º’´ ‘µ’≤’Æ’ß ’é’°’∂÷Ñ), in the historical country of Varanda (Armenian: ’é’°÷Ä’°’∂’§’°, presently in the Martuni District of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic). The use of embedded khachkars in Bri Yeghtze is the same as in the Tzaghatz Kar Monastery (Armenian: ’ë’°’≤’°’≤ ’î’°÷Ä’´ ’é’°’∂÷Ñ, in Vayots Dzor Province of Armenia) and in the Horomos Monastery near Kars (Armenian: ’Ä’∏’º’∏’¥’∏’Ω’´ ’é’°’∂÷Ñ, now in Turkey).Rev. Hamazasp Voskian. The Monasteries of Artsakh, Vienna, 1953, chapter 3 A large khachkar, brought from Artsakh's Metz Arants Hermitage (Armenian: ’Ñ’•’Æ ‘±’º’°’∂÷Å ‘±’∂’°’∫’°’ø) to St. Echmiadzin, represents a rare type of the so-called \\"winged crosses\\" which resemble Celtic cross stones from Scotland and Ireland. The largest collection of standing khachkars in Artsakh is in the area called Tsera Nahatak, near the village of Badara.  Lapidary inscriptions  Armenian-inscribed text of Queen Arzu of Haterk, Dadivank Monastery (13th century) In most cases, facades and walls of Artsakh's churches and monasteries contain engraved texts in Armenian that often provide the precise date of construction, names of patrons and, sometimes, even name of the architect. The number of such texts exceeds several hundred. Covering the walls of churches and monasteries with ornamented texts in Armenian developed in Artsakh, and in many other places in historical Armenia, into a unique form of decor.Boris Baratov. Paradise Laid Waste: A Journey to Karabakh, Lingvist Publishers, Moscow, 1998. p. 63-73 Compared with other Armenian lands, Artsakh contains a very large number of Armenian lapidary (inscribed in stone) texts per unit of territory, which date from the 5th century. The most notable and extensive of those cover entire walls of the Dadivank and Gandzasar monasteries. A prominent inscription, for instance, details the foundation of Dadivank's Memorial Cathedral; it covers a large area of the Cathedral's southern facade. It begins with the following section: \\"By the grace of God Almighty and his only begotten son Jesus Christ, and by the grace of the most Holy Spirit, I, Arzou Hatun, humble servant of the Christ, the daughter of the greatest prince of princes Kurt and the spouse of the Crown Prince Vakhtang, Lord of Haterk and the whole of Upper Khachen, with utmost hope have built this holy cathedral in the place of the last rest of my husband and my two sons ‚Ä¶ My elder [son] Hasan martyred for his Christian faith in the war against the Turks; and in three months my younger son Grigor died of natural causes and passed to the Christ, leaving his mother in inconsolable mourning. While [my sons] were alive, they vowed to build a church to the glory of God ‚Ä¶ and I undertook the construction of this expiatory temple with utmost hope and diligence, for the salvation of their souls, and mine and all of my nephews. Thus I plead: while worshipping before the holy altar, remember my prayers inscribed on this church ‚Ä¶ Completed in the year [modern 1214] of the Armenian Calendar‚Ä¶\\" Samvel Karapetian. Armenian Cultural Monuments in the Region of Karabakh, Yerevan: Gitutiun Publishing House, 2001, chapter: Dadivank Another historic text inscribed in Armenian is found on the tombstone of St. Grigoris, Bishop of Artsakh, at the Amaras Monastery. St. Grigoris was St. Gregory the Enlightener's grandson who martyred preaching Gospel in the Northern Caucasus: \\"The tomb of St. Grigoris, Katholicos of Aghvank, grandson of St. Gregory; born in [322 AD], anointed in the year [340 AD], martyred in the year [348 AD] in Derbend, by King Sanesan of the Mazkuts; his holy remains were brought to Amaras by his pupils, deacons from Artsakh.\\" Rev. Hamazasp Voskian. The Monasteries of Artsakh, Vienna, 1953, Chapter 1.  Fresco art  Few of Artsakh's frescoes were preserved, but those which survived are important for the history of Armenian fresco art because of their unique compositional features and color schemes. The largest collection of Artsakh's frescos are found inside the Memorial Cathedral (1214), at the Dadivank Monastery. The Memorial Cathedral was built by the orders of Queen Arzou of Haterk.Lydia –ê. Durnovo, Essays on the Fine Arts of Medieval Armenia. Moscow. 1979.[In Russian] The paintings depict St. Mary, Jesus Christ and St. Nicholas, with a group of angels and worshippers. The 13th-century fresco painting of the Holy Virgin inside the Memorial Cathedral of the Dadivank Monastery The fresco on the southern wall shows the Holy Virgin in a long robe with a red kerchief tied around her head. She is holding an oration adorned with crosses. Another fresco portrays the Christ, as he is giving the Gospel to St. Nicholas. The fresco on the northern wall represents the birth of Jesus: St. Joseph stands at St. Mary's bedside, and the three magicians kneel in adoration in front; cherubs fly in the sky above them, singing Glory in Highest Heaven.Nicholas Holding. Armenia with Nagorno Karabagh. The Bradt Travel Guide. Second edition (October 1, 2006). Dadivank. A native of Artsakh and the 13th century author Kirakos Gandzaketsi (Armenian: ‘ø’´÷Ä’°’Ø’∏’Ω ‘≥’°’∂’±’°’Ø’•÷Å’´) hints in his \\"History of Armenia\\" that Queen Arzou (Armenian: ‘±’º’¶’∏÷Ç ‘π’°’£’∏÷Ç’∞’´) and her daughters were gifted with exceptional artistic talent, so it has been theorized that they could have been among those who helped paint the murals.Kirakos, Gandzaketsi, 1201-1271. Kirakos Gandzaketsi's history of the Armenians (New York: Sources of the Armenian Tradition, 1986) Other than at Dadivank, Some other frescoes are found in the main parish church of the town of Arajadzor in Mardakert District.  Illuminated manuscripts  More than thirty known medieval manuscripts originate in Artsakh, Many of which are 13th and 14th century illuminated manuscripts created during the Principality of Khachen. These scripts were created in Ganja, Azerbaijan, as well as at Karabakh's monasteries of Gandzasar, Khoranashat (Armenian: ‘Ω’∏÷Ä’°’∂’°’∑’°’ø), Targmanchatz, Holy Virgin of Tzar (Armenian: ‘æ’°’º’° ’ç’¢. ‘±’Ω’ø’æ’°’Æ’°’Æ’´’∂) and Yerits Mankants (Armenian: ‘µ÷Ä’´÷Å ’Ñ’°’∂’Ø’°’∂÷Å ’é’°’∂÷Ñ).Hravard Hagopian. The Miniatures of Artsakh and Utik: Thirteenth-Fourteenth Centuries, Yerevan, 1989, p. 136 [In Armenian] A group of illuminated works is specific to the regions of Artsakh and Utik; in their linear and unadorned style they resemble miniatures of the Syunik and Vaspurakan schools. These compositions are simple and monumental, often with an iconography that is original and distinct from Byzantine models. Besides depicting biblical stories, several of Artsakh's manuscripts attempt to convey the images of the rulers of the region who often ordered the rewriting and illumination of the texts. Manuscript No. 115 preserved at the Matenadaran Institute of Ancient Manuscripts in Yerevan, Armenia contains a miniature portrait of Prince Vakhtang Tangik (Armenian: ’é’°’≠’©’°’∂’£ ‘π’°’∂’£’´’Ø, Vakhtang the Precious) Lord of Haterk.Hravard Hagopian. The Miniatures of Artsakh and Utik: Thirteenth-Fourteenth Centuries, Yerevan, 1989, p. 137 [In Armenian] During the 12th-15th centuries several dozens of well-known scriptoria functioned in Artsakh and neighboring Utik.Jean-Michel Thierry. Eglises et Couvents du Karabagh, Antelais: Lebanon, 1991. p. 63 The best period of Artsakh's miniature painting may be divided into two main stages. The first one includes the second half of the 12th and the beginning of the 13th centuries. The second stage includes the second half of the 13th century to the beginning of the 14th century. Among the most interesting works of the first stage one can mention the Matenadaran manuscript no. 378, called the Gospel of Prince Vakhtang Khachentsi (produced in 1212), and the Matenadaran manuscript no. 4829, a Gospel produced in 1224 and associated with the name of Princess Vaneni Jajro.  Carpets and rugs  Carpets and rugs are a form of art which is central to the artistic identity of the region. It is known that in the tenth century dyed fabrics and rugs from Artsakh were highly valued in the Arab world. Two accounts by the historian Kirakos Gandzaketsi mention embroideries and altar curtains handmade by his contemporaries Arzou and Khorishah‚Äîtwo princesses of the House of Upper Khachen (Haterk/’Ä’°’©’•÷Ä÷Ñ)‚Äîfor the Dadivank Monastery. In the 19th century, local rugs and samples of natural silk production became part of international exhibitions and art fairs in Moscow, Philadelphia and Paris. The abundance of rugs produced in the modern period is rooted in this solid ancient tradition. Indeed, recent research has begun to highlight the importance of the Armenian region of Artsakh in the history of a broader group of rugs classified as \\"Caucasian.\\" Woven works by Artsakh's Armenians come in several types. Rugs in an \\"eaglebands\\" (Armenian: ’°÷Ä’Æ’æ’°’£’∏÷Ä’£/artzvagorg) or \\"sunburst\\" (Armenian: ’°÷Ä÷á’°’£’∏÷Ä’£/arevagorg) pattern, a sub-type of Armenian rug featuring dragons, whose manufacturing center from the eighteenth century was Artsakh's county of Jraberd, have characteristically large radiating medallions. Other rugs come with ornaments resembling serpents (\\"serpentbands;\\" Armenian: ÷Ö’±’°’£’∏÷Ä’£/odzagorg) or clouds with octagonal medallions comprising four pairs of serpents in an \\"S\\" shape, and rugs with a series of octagonal, cross-shaped or rhomboid medallions, often bordered by a red band.Lucy Der Manuelian and Murray Eiland. Weavers, Merchants and Kings: The Inscribed Rugs of Armenia, Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, 1984 Artsakh is also the source of some of the oldest rugs bearing Armenian inscriptions: the rug with three niches from the town of Banants (1602), the rug of Catholicos Nerses of Aghvank (1731), and the famous Guhar (Gohar) Rug (1700). It should also be added that most rugs with Armenian inscriptions come from Artsakh.Lucy Der Manuelian and Murray Eiland.

Among the many schemes to build a line between Rugby and Leamington was one by the Rugby, Leamington and Warwick Railway Company. This later became known as the Rugby and Leamington Railway and received Royal assent on 13 August 1846. It was sold to the London and North Western Railway almost immediately on 17 November 1846. Birdingbury station in 2010 It was not, however, until 1 March 1851 that the line opened with stations at Birdingbury and Marton, that at Dunchurch opening in 1871. Originally it was a single line, but was doubled in the 1880s, and the driveway leading to its level crossing was private property used by arrangement with the owners. The station building was of plain but substantial brick-built design and, on the opposite down platform, there was a waiting room with an awning (not present on the main platform). On the up side was a short double head shunt, with a siding leading to a loading stage. Unusually, on each platform was a small lever frame which could be used when the signal box was closed.Preston Hendry, R., Powell Hendry, R., (1982) An historical survey of selected LMS stations : layouts and illustrations.

Bos started her acting career in Antwerp, but soon returned to the Netherlands and made her theater debut in 1909. She played mostly bit parts, until she was discovered by movie director Maurits Binger. Binger had just opened his movie studio Hollandia and contracted Bos as the leading lady of the movies. She made her first film appearance in the film De Levende Ladder. Over the next years, she became a well recognized actress, being nicknamed \\"the Dutch Asta Nielsen\\". In 1916, Bos starred in Majoor Frans (1916) and became Holland's first star. She got opportunities to choose her own film roles and attempted to prove her acting skills by playing roles with opposite characters. However, when Hollandia neared bankruptcy in 1920, the studio was renewed and the new movie directors fired Bos, saying she was too old. Bos was offered a contract in the United States, where she was known for her role in the Dutch film Een Carmen van het Noorden (1919), which was released internationally. She arrived in New York City in 1921, where she discovered the studio she was contracted to, didn't exist anymore. Bos stayed in the United States, attempting to get a film contract, but had no success. After playing a small role opposite Pearl White in the American film Without Fear (1922), she travelled to Germany, but didn't have any luck there either. In 1924, she moved back to the Netherlands, where an old friend gave her the lead in Mooi Juultje van Volendam (1924). The film flopped and was removed from cinemas after one week. Bos felt she didn't belong in the new film industry anymore and returned to theater. She acted in the play Madame DuBarry, which got critical claim. Bos finally retired in 1925, to marry Cornelis Loeff. She was soon forgotten by the public. Her death in 1975 reached only one newspaper. Actress Willeke van Ammelrooy portrayed her in a play in 2006.

Florence 1925 ‚Äì d. Florence 2007) was an Italian artist and writer, considered to be one of the fathers of Italian visual poetry. Biography Eugenio Miccini (1925 in Florence ‚Äì 2007 in Florence) is considered to be one of the fathers of Italian visual poetry.  Education and career  Graduated in Pedagogy, in 1963 he founded together with poets, musicians and painters Gruppo '70, creating the Italian term \\"poesia visiva\\" (visual poetry). Visual poetry is an art research characterized by predominance of the image on the typographical text, aimed to obtain compositions where words and images, signs and figures, are integrated without solution of continuity on the semantic plane (Dizionario della lingua italiana Devoto-Oli, Le Monnier). In Italy the 1960s have been rich of activities of Gruppo 70, starting from two meetings organized in Florence in 1963, focusing on \\"Art and Communication\\" and in 1964 \\"Arte and Technology\\", where discussion touched on interdisciplinary, interactivity, this means those practices in the arts characterized by multicode or mixed-media operations, operations that could be classified as \\"total poetry\\", this means realized with the most wide synesthesia, including in the performances sounds and noise, gestures and actions, various materials, newspaper and reviews, and also parfumes and food. Eugenio Miccini has collaborated as expert of semiotic matter to the Cathedra Strumenti e Tecniche della comunicazione visiva of the University of Florence (Architecture Faculty). He was teaching Contemporary Art History in the fine art academies of Verona e Ravenna. Miccini's work is included in the Italian Treccani Encyclopedia and was object of doctoral research also at University La Sorbonne of Paris and at the University of Belgrade. He is included in anthologies and school books in Italy, such as Storia dell'Arte Italiana, by Carlo Bertelli, Giuliano Briganti, Antonio Giuliano, Electa ‚Äì Bruno Mondadori. His works are in many public collections, among them: Biennale di Venezia, Museo della Pilotta of Parma, Museum of Modern Art of New York, Museum BWA of Dublin, and in the public galleries of C√©ret, Mantua, Bologna, Valencia, Anversa, Warsaw, Tokyo, and others. He participated in the most important international exhibitions, such as: Biennale di Venezia (four times), Quadriennale of Rome (as commissar), Stedelijik Museum of Amsterdam, Palazzo Forti of Verona, Palazzo Vecchio of Florence, Museums of Marseille, GAM, Palazzo dei Diamanti of Ferrara. He published more than seventy books, art books and essays. He died in Florence on 19 June 2007.

They functioned from 1637 to 1660.  Origin  The monastery of Port-Royal- des-Champs was more or less abandoned in favour of that in Paris (for health reasons - the site was malarial) when in 1637 Jean Duvergier de Hauranne, abbot of Saint-Cyran, decided to set up a school for 30 children here, headed by his friend, the priest Antoine Singlin. This school shared the building with the Solitaires, intellectuals or politicians who had decided to go into retreat to perfect their spiritual life, many of whom taught at the school. Its teachers' intellectual calibre made Petites √©coles de Port-Royal a place of intellectual excellence, but also of experimentation in teaching methods (based on French and not Latin and thus revolutionary for the time) and in normalization of the French language. They also withdrew from the Jesuit teaching system, which mainly taught in Latin, even when their young students had not mastered Latin. Class sizes were small (never more than 25 children) to create a teacher-pupil relationship that was very strict but also marked by trust and admiration. Discipline was very severe, but many of its teaching rules demonstrate a real concern for what would later be called child psychology.

It stars Shelley Winters, Peter Falk, Lee Grant and Leonard Nimoy. George J. Folsey was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography. Ben Maddow was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award. The film also credits the photographer Helen Levitt as an assistant director, and Verna Fields, who subsequently won the Academy Award for Best Film Editing, as the sound editor. Plot Shelley Winters plays the madam of a brothel where customers play out their erotic fantasies, oblivious to a revolution that is sweeping the country. When her old friend, the chief of police (Peter Falk), asks her to impersonate the missing queen in order to reassure the people and halt the revolution, she offers instead that three of her customers play the general, bishop and chief justice, all of whom have died in the revolution. Reception Shortly after its release, the film was negatively reviewed by The New York Times critic Bosley Crowther, but favorably reviewed in Variety: \\"With Jean Genet's apparent approval, Joe Strick and Ben Maddow have eliminated the play's obscene language (though it's still plenty rough) and clarified some of its obscurations. The result is a tough, vivid and dispassionate fantasy.\\" Following the release of the DVD in 2000, Karl Wareham also reviewed the film favorably: \\"'The Balcony' is recommended for those who like an enigma of a film, one that tugs at your subconscious long after the titles fade. It‚Äôs a film that reaches to the very heart of why our society works in the way it does, and presents unrelenting questions and dilemmas.\\" Preservation The Academy Film Archive preserved The Balcony in 2010.

She was laid down on 10 March 1942 by Canadian Vickers Ltd. in Montreal, Quebec, Canada as the HMS Adur (K296) to serve in the British Royal Navy. She was launched on 22 August 1942 but due to a lack of American vessels for convoy protection she was transferred to the United States Navy prior to completion. On 1 December 1942, she was commissioned in Montreal as USS Asheville (PG-101), a patrol gunboat. She was reclassified PF-1 on 15 April 1943. Initially Asheville served on convoy escort but then transferred to anti-submarine patrols. She was decommissioned in January 1946 at the Norfolk Navy Yard and struck from the Navy Register in February. She was sold in June 1946 and later resold to Argentina where she was renamed Hercules and later Juan B. Azopardo (GC 11). She was stricken in 1973, but her fate beyond that is not reported in secondary sources. Service historyWorld War II=Convoys and patrols After her launch and commissioning, Asheville sailed to Boston, Massachusetts via the Saint Lawrence River and Atlantic Ocean where she was completed. Lieutenant Commander Robert P. Walker was placed in command. On 23 February 1943, Asheville reported to the Commander, Eastern Sea Frontier, for duty. She was assigned to escort convoys between New York City and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She continued this until 2 September, when she was reassigned to anti-submarine patrols. On 17 September, she escorted a burned-out ammunition ship out to sea and scuttled her in the deep waters. Asheville continued antisubmarine patrols until May 1944. Experimental testing In May 1944, Asheville reported to the Boston Navy Yard where experimental anti- submarine warfare (ASW) gear was installed. Once the equipment was installed she began testing it under guidance of the Commander, Antisubmarine Development Detachment, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (COMASDEVLANT). In early September, her experimental testing was interrupted when she joined a hunter- killer group in a search for a suspected German U-boat. The search turned up nothing and she reported back to her experimental testing. On 15 September, she relocated to Port Everglades, Florida, COMASDEVLANT's new surface ship base. She operated out of that port until April 1945, testing several ASW devices. On 13 April 1945, Asheville reported to New York with a new assignment with the Commander, Eastern Sea Frontier, where she returned to antisubmarine patrols. Less than a month later, on 8 May, hostilities ended in Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. With the threat of U-boats gone, Asheville returned to Port Everglades where she underwent more experimental testing. On 19 July 1945, she received orders to return to New York where an experimental radar system was installed. She spent the remainder of 1945 testing the RADAR system along the eastern coast. =Argentine service= On 14 January 1946, Asheville was decommissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Virginia. Her name was struck from the Navy Register on 25 February 1946, and she was sold to the United Boat Service Corporation on 15 June 1946. She was later sold to Argentina and was renamed ARA Hercules (P-31) and later PNA Juan B. Azopardo (GC-11). Her exact fate is unknown.

One-act plays were unfashionable in the 1920s and 30s, but Coward was fond of the genre and conceived the idea of a set of short pieces to be played across several evenings. The actress most closely associated with him was Gertrude Lawrence, and he wrote the plays as vehicles for them both. The Astonished Heart depicts a leading psychiatrist falling passionately in love with an old friend of his wife. She has wilfully led him on but is unprepared for the disastrous effect on him. Increasingly desperate, he watches his own mind lose control of itself, and he finally kills himself. The title is taken from Deuteronomy: \\"the Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart\\". The cycle was first produced in 1935 in Manchester and then toured for nine weeks before opening in London (1936) and New York (1936‚Äì37). It has been revived occasionally and has been adapted for film, television and radio. Background and first productions Short plays had been popular in the previous century, often as curtain-raisers and afterpieces to longer plays. By the 1920s they had gone out of fashion, but Coward was fond of the genre and wrote several early in his career.Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 25‚Äì27 and 52 He wrote, \\"A short play, having a great advantage over a long one in that it can sustain a mood without technical creaking or over padding, deserves a better fate, and if, by careful writing, acting and producing I can do a little towards reinstating it in its rightful pride, I shall have achieved one of my more sentimental ambitions.\\"Quoted in Morley (2005), p. 66 In 1935 he conceived the idea of a set of short plays, to run in varying permutations on three consecutive nights at the theatre. His biographer Philip Hoare describes it as \\"a bold idea, risky and innovative\\".Hoare, p. 268 Coward finished writing all ten of the plays by the end of August 1935.Morley (1974), p. 188; and Hoare, p. 269 The actress most closely associated with Coward was Gertrude Lawrence, his oldest friend, with whom he had first acted as a child in Hannele in 1913.Hoare, pp. 27, 30 and 51 They starred together in his revue London Calling! (1923) and his comedy Private Lives (1930‚Äì31),Morley, (1999), p. viii; and Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 209 and 217 and he wrote the Tonight at 8.30 plays \\"as acting, singing and dancing vehicles for Gertrude Lawrence and myself\\".Quoted in Mander and Mitchenson, p. 283 Coward directed the plays as well as acting in them. They were performed in various combinations of three. Coward loved playing in some of the other plays in Tonight at 8.30, particularly Fumed Oak and Red Peppers, but \\"I hated playing The Astonished Heart. It depressed me.\\"Castle, p. 139 The Astonished Heart was first presented on 15 October 1935 at the Opera House, Manchester, the second play in a programme that began with We Were Dancing and ended with Red Peppers.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 282 The first London performance was on 9 January 1936 at the Phoenix Theatre.\\"Phoenix Theatre\\", The Times, 19 January 1936, p. 15.

As in Manchester, the programme also included We Were Dancing and Red Peppers.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 283 The New York run of the cycle, a limited season, as in London, ended prematurely because Coward was taken ill.

Along with Chris's secretary, Susan, and his assistant, Tim, Barbara is waiting for the arrival of Leonora Vail. Sir Reginald French, a surgeon, enters from a bedroom, asking if Leonora has come yet. Barbara asks, \\"There isn't much time, is there?\\" The doctor replies that he fears not, and that his patient is asking for Leonora in his moments of consciousness. The doorbell rings. Barbara comments \\"It's the same ‚Äì exactly the same as a year ago ... the first time she ever came into this room\\". Ernest, the butler announces Mrs Vail; the lights fade and come up again on the second scene, which is a flashback to November 1934. Barbara, Tim, Susan and Ernest are all in the same positions, though with minor changes of costume. Leonora, an old school friend of Barbara, enters. When Chris looks in for a few moments, his manner to Leonora is vague and uninterested. Leonora tells Barbara that she much prefers his nice assistant, Tim. She leaves, after inviting Barbara, Tim and Chris (\\"if he'll come\\") to lunch. Tim comes in, looking for a Bible: Chris wants a quotation for his next lecture on psychopathology. They borrow the cook's Bible and find the passage he wants: \\"The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of the heart.\\" In the third scene, two months later, Chris and Leonora have become considerably more intimate: they are kissing each other passionately. Leonora confesses that she has deliberately tried to make him fall in love, in revenge for his dismissive manner at their first meeting. He admits that he was deliberately rude to her at first because \\"You irritated me, you were so conscious of how beautiful you looked\\". He adds that despite his affair with Leonora he loves Barbara \\"deeply and truly and for ever\\". The scene ends with another passionate clinch. Three months later, scene four takes place on an early April morning. Barbara has been sitting up all night, waiting for Chris to come home. She greets him calmly but insists on some straight talking. She tells him that his increasingly unhinged mental state, brought on by the strain of his affair, is affecting his work and his life. She says he should go away with Leonora for two or three months, leaving Tim to run the practice. In the fifth scene, in November, Chris and Leonora quarrel bitterly. She says she is leaving him. He throws her to the floor. After she picks herself up and leaves, he drinks two glasses of whisky, goes to the window and jumps out. The final scene is a continuation of the first.

The concept was rejected four times between 2007 and 2015 for the Cosmic Vision programme \\"M\\" medium-class missions. Overview Marco Polo was a mission concept aimed at visiting a small asteroid and returning a sample to Earth for analysis in laboratory. The concept was initially studied by the European Space Agency (ESA) in collaboration with the Japan Aerospace eXploration Agency JAXA, that referred to it as Hayabusa Mk2. Marco Polo was first rejected in June 2007 for the Cosmic Vision program, but was selected for further assessment studies in November 2007. The in-situ investigation and sample analysis would allow to improve knowledge of the physical and chemical properties of a small Near- Earth object (NEO) which is believed to have kept the original composition of the solar nebula in which planets formed. Thus, it would provide some constraints to the models of planet formation and some information on how life ingredients may have been brought to Earth. Information on the physical structure would help defining efficient mitigation strategies against a potential threatening object. Small bodies, as primitive leftover building blocks of the Solar System formation process, offer clues to the chemical mixture from which the planets formed some 4.6 billion years ago. Current exobiological scenarios for the origin of life invoke an exogenous delivery of organic compounds to the early Earth. It has been proposed that carbonaceous chondrite matter (in the form of planetesimals or dust) could have brought these complex organic molecules capable of triggering the pre-biotic synthesis of biochemical compounds on the early Earth. Moreover, collisions of NEOs with Earth pose a finite hazard to life. For all these reasons, the exploration of such objects is particularly interesting and urgent. The Marco Polo proposals were supported by more than 400 scientists worldwide. This concept was in competition for the M1, M2, M3 and M4 missions. It was rejected all four times. Primary objective The principal scientific objective of the Marco Polo mission is to return unaltered materials from a Near-Earth object (NEO) for analyses in terrestrial laboratories, and to obtain measurements that cannot yet be performed from a robotic spacecraft: #Morphological surface properties #Environment conditions (e.g. dust, gravity field) #Mass, volume and bulk density #Mineralogical composition #Surface (and possibly subsurface) mineralogy and thermophysical properties (thermal inertia, conductivity, diffusivity, cohesion of the materials) #Surface elemental composition and distribution #Overall internal structure properties #Global topography #Volatile abundance #Search for organic compounds =Additional objectives= The mission would allow to: *Determine the physical and chemical properties of the target body, which are representative of the building blocks of the terrestrial planets. *Identify the major events (e.g. agglomeration, heating, aqueous alteration, solar wind interactions ...) which influenced the history of the target. *Determine the elemental and mineralogical properties of the target body and their variations with geological context on the surface. *Search for pre-solar material yet unknown in meteoritic samples. *Investigate the nature and origin of organic compounds on the target body. *Understand the role of minor body impacts in the origin and evolution of life on Earth. MarcoPolo-R and MarcoPolo-2D Marco Polo's first two rejections came in the competitions for the European Space Agency's Cosmic Vision program M1 and M2 missions, which were supposed to be launched in 2018 and 2020, respectively. MarcoPolo-R, as it was then renamed and re-submitted, then lost out in the M3 competition in 2014. The mission was then renamed and re-submitted as MarcoPolo-2D to compete for the M4 opportunity, but it was rejected in March 2015 at the first stage of the competition. A baseline mission scenario to asteroid 1999 JU3 included a launch with a Soyuz-type launcher of a Mother Spacecraft (MSC) possibly carrying a lander, a sampling device, a re-entry capsule and scientific payloads. The lander would perform a soft landing, anchor to the asteroid surface, and make various in situ measurements of surface/subsurface materials near the sampling site. Samples would be collected with either one or complementary techniques. Once the sampling and in-situ measurements are completed, the MSC would start the return journey towards Earth and would release the capsule for the high-speed re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. After appropriate space quarantine and sterilization processes, samples would be taken out of the capsule in a dedicated sample curation facility to conduct initial sample characterization, prior to their distribution to designated scientists for detailed analyses. Proposed targets Some proposed targets of the Marco Polo concept were:Potential Targets of MarcoPolo-R Mission Retrieved 15 January 2019. *C-type asteroids 1999 JU3 and 1989 UQ *primitive asteroids type D 2001 SG286 and type T 2001 SK162 *(341843) 2008 EV5 *dormant comet 4015 Wilson‚ÄìHarrington (1979 VA), which can provide insights on the unknown link between asteroids and comets *The primitive C-type binary asteroid 1996 FG3, which can provide insight into binary formation processes Proposed payload The scientific payloads would include a high resolution imaging system, visible and infrared and mid spectrometers, a LIDAR, and a dust monitor.MarcoPolo-R Payload Definition Document.

These instruments would be operated during the approach, hovering and descent phases for science purpose, for landing site selection and for spacecraft safety during near-surface manoeuvres. The Lander would have its own payload for the characterization of the in situ measurements (e.g., close-up camera, panoramic camera, electron microscope, X-ray diffractometer, volatile detector, microbalance, mass spectrometer). Instruments on the lander would be operated in-situ through automatic or Earth commanded sequences. These instruments would also allow to characterize location and surface environment on site of the sampling.

The weapon was never mass-produced and was supplanted in 1964 by an improved design, the M139. History The M134 bomblet, developed as the E130, or E130R1 bomblet, began development in the early 1950s. While the weapon was not yet battle-ready, or ready for mass-production, in 1960, work on the bomblet dated back to at least 1953. By 1964 the bomblet design had been improved and the smaller M139 was adapted for use with the rocket warheads utilized by the M134. Thus, the M134 was never mass-produced; by the time the missile warhead and the M134 were ready for production they had been supplanted. Specifications The M134 bomblet was designed for the M190 Honest John rocket warhead. The bomblets carried sarin nerve agent and after the missile was fired the bomblets were released above their target. At the time of the sub-munitions release a mechanical time fuze would cut the warhead's skin and the bomblets were released. The weapon could effectively saturate an area in diameter with chemical agent. The Honest John held 356 of the 115 mm M134s.Kirby, Reid. \\"The CB Battlefield Legacy: Understanding the Potential Problem of Clustered CB Weapons \\", Army Chemical Review, pp. 25-29, July-December 2006, accessed January 5, 2009. The spherical M134 was 4.5 inches around and constructed of ribbed steel. Its interior held about of sarin (GB). The U.S. Army Chemical Corps originally planned to use the M134 as a VX dispersement method also, but later regarded this use as ineffective and scrapped the plan.\\"Summary of Major Events and Problems - United States Army Chemical Corps: Fiscal Year 1960\\", April 1961 U.S. Army Chemical Corps Historical Office, via Office of Scientific & Technical Information, U.S. Department of Energy, accessed January 5, 2009. Issues The warhead meant to carry the M134 was classified and went into production on April 14, 1960, the M134, however, was not yet ready for production. The M134 had a host of issues which impeded its development. Problems with the fuze system, and a tendency toward unacceptable pressure build-up in filled munitions were among the problems encountered during development. The problems with the M134 delayed the rocket-delivered nerve agent program. By 1964 the successor M139 bomblet was ready for production.Smart, Jeffery K.

A view months later Ursula S completed mittageisen as bass-player and the band recorded a demo-tape with six songs, which were partly published on the first album in 1983. Ursula S left the group shortly before the recording-sessions for their first album in the autumn 1982. ; ; As a typical post-punk band mittageisen developed their own individual music style and became thereby > \\"one of the earliest Darkwave/electro Goth bands. These tracks were mostly > recorded from '82 to '85 (seven of them in '82 when Depeche Mode still > couldn't get enough), mixing the emerging Gothic sounds of the Banshees, > Bauhaus and The Cure with the sparse electro of Kraftwerk.

There is, however, a very simple and obvious > reason why this band do not occupy the same privileged position as the > classic Goth bands - they didn't sing in English.

It's the kind of > music you hear as the soundtrack for oppressive, dark German sci-fi films. > The sound does not stay the same all the way through, 'automaten', which is > here in two versions, is a fairly upbeat, electro piece. Others are more > sound-scapey; droning pieces that evoke factory work. This CD is more than > an historical oddity, it is a must for fans of early Sisters stuff, or the > Cure's dark period which culminated in the oppressive 'Pornography'\\". Beside the music the sociocritical, expressive lyrics written by Bruno W, supplemented the music arrestingly and attract the attention of the critics. Among various concerts - also with other bands such as Liliput, The Vyllies and Propaganda - mittageisen became one of the most shaped Swiss new wave band, especially with the release of the first album in March 1983. They earned extraordinarily positive reviews and their album became ‚Äòrecord of the week‚Äô on Swiss Radio and the songs were played often on various radio stations especially in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. After the departure of Markus Sch (guitar) and the completion with Manuela H (synthesizer) mittageisen published in January 1985 the 12\\" single \\"automaten\\", with a for that time new electro sound. As Bruno W said in an interview the band wasn't satisfied with the first studio-version of \\"automaten\\" and he travelled to Cologne to mix the final-version in collaboration with Detlev K√ºhne (Die Hornissen) and Tom Dokoupil (The Wirtschaftswunder) at their studio. The 12\\" single found the way into the legendary John Peel show on BBC1 and became an 'indie disco' hit. After last recording sessions in 1986 the band split up. Mastermind Bruno W published some years later under the name \\"mittageisen v2\\" the single \\"geld ‚Äì arbeit / money ‚Äì work\\", which was published in two editions with different versions. On the second edition he worked together with Marco Repetto, a member of the famous NDW-band Grauzone, Techno and Ambient DJ, musician and producer.

Anthoine Singlin began his priestly career beside Vincent de Paul, at the hospice de la Piti√© in Paris. He was then a devoted disciple of Jean du Vergier de Hauranne, abbot of Saint-Cyran and spiritual director of the monastery of Port-Royal. When he was imprisoned in the Bastille on the orders of cardinal Richelieu (from 1638 to 1643), he declared Anthoine Singlin's spiritual training complete and made him his intermediary between prison and the nuns and Solitaires at the monastery. When Jean du Vergier de Hauranne died in 1643, some months after leaving prison, Anthoine Singlin accepted the post of almoner and spiritual director of the community, despite his own wishes to live a more retired life. Even so, in 1637 he set up Port-Royal-des- Champs's famous Petites √©coles de Port-Royal, with Jean Hamon and the other Solitaires. His correspondence, recently studied and annotated, is a valuable witness to the practicalities of the monastery's life. Anthoine Singlin continued Saint-Cyran's work spiritually, gaining a great reputation due to his words' simplicity. Uncompromising, charitable and renouncing the world, he became official confessor of Port-Royal in 1648. The problems caused by the signing of the formulary of Alexander VII in 1661 forced him to flee the monastery, then to try not to sign, all to cause as little scandal as he could.

Early life Thomas Potter born on 5 April 1774 in Tadcaster, Yorkshire, the seventh of nine children of John Potter, a draper, and his wife Anne Hartley. His brothers were Richard who became MP for Wigan, and William. His father, John Potter, was born on 7 December 1728 in Tadcaster and died there on 28 November 1802. He is buried in grave 40655 at St Mary the Virgin's Church in Tadcaster. He worked as a journeyman in London and on the death of his father, also John Potter, on 16 June 1758, and his mother, Anne, on 2 May 1762, he succeeded to their draper's shop in Tadcaster. He took a farm at Wighill where he dealt in sheep and wool.From Ploughshare to Parliament, by Georgina Meinertzhagen p.3 On 23 December 1785 an indenture was made for the lease of Wingate Hill Farm between Sir Walter Vavasour and John Potter Indenture concerning the lease of Wingate Hill Farm \\"The produce of it (Wingate Hill Farm) having been successively on the advance, his shop, too, having been conducted by his wife and children, all his concerns prospered, and enabled him to set two of his sons (William and Richard) up in Manchester at the beginning of this year (1802) with a capital possessed by few beginners (¬£ 14,000). And he died worth twelve thousand pounds, which, on the death of his spouse, he left equally to his sons and daughters.\\"From Ploughshare to Parliament, by Georgina Meinertzagen, extract from Son Richard's Diary in 1802, p.3 William and Richard Potter opened a warehouse in Manchester at 5 Cannon Street, and a few months later they were joined by Thomas. The firm of William, Thomas and Richard Potter was established on 1 January 1803. William stood down from the business in 1806 when it became Thomas and Richard Potter.English Merchants, by H.R. Fox Bourne, p. 267 First Little Circle The Potter family were wealthy Unitarians who attended Cross Street Chapel, and were concerned with the welfare of the poor. Thomas and Richard Potter became concerned with unfair representation of the people in parliament in rapidly expanding industrialised towns such as Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and Salford in the Victorian era and decided to form a group to promote change. In 1815 the first Little Circle was formed, around a core of members from the Cross Street Chapel who were influenced by the ideas of Jeremy Bentham and Joseph Priestley. The founding members included John Edward Taylor (cotton merchant), Joseph Brotherton (a non-conformist minister and pioneering vegetarian), Thomas Preston, and Thomas and Richard Potter.English Merchants by H. R. Fox Bourne Meetings were held in a room at the back of the Potters' Cannon Street counting-house, generally known as the \\"plotting-parlour\\", and its core membership was Unitarian. Group member Archibald Prentice (later editor of the Manchester Times) called them the \\"Little Circle\\"; other members were John Shuttleworth (industrialist and municipal reformer); Absalom Watkin (parliamentary reformer and anti corn law campaigner); and William Cowdroy Jnr (editor of the Manchester Gazette). After group members witnessed the Peterloo Massacre in 1819, and the closure of the liberal Manchester Observer by successive police prosecutions,'Manchester Gazette,' 7 August 1819, quoted in David Ayerst, 'The Guardian,' 1971, p 20 it decided the time was right to advance its liberalist agenda. In 1820, Brotherton, Shuttleworth and Thomas Potter founded the Manchester Chamber of Commerce. In the following year, the group supported John Edward Taylor found the liberal newspaper the Manchester Guardian to which they all contributed. Published by law only once a week, Taylor continued to edit the newspaper until his death. Business career Whilst his brother, Richard, applied himself almost exclusively to political movements and reform, becoming Member of Parliament for Wigan in 1830, Thomas was left in charge of the management of the warehouse which developed into the largest concern of its type in Manchester. Second Little Circle In 1821, 12 merchants met in Thomas and Richard Potter's \\"plotting parlour\\" in Cannon Street, and began a fund to support the Manchester Guardian Seven were Unitarians, including five from the Cross Street Chapel: Thomas and Richard Potter; Abasolm Watkin; Mark Philips, John Shuttleworth, John Benjamin Smith, and brothers Edward and William Baxter (all cotton merchants); Fenton Atkinson (prominent Manchester attorney); William Harvey; John Edward Taylor. The group supported social reform issues discreetly: Taylor survived a trial for libel; Shuttleworth organised the defence of plebeian reformers accused of administering an illegal oath. The group initially proposed that the seats of rotten boroughs convicted of gross electoral corruption should be transferred to industrial towns, citing and later targeting example boroughs including Penryn and East Retford. But when Parliament refused to take action, in 1831 Absalom Watkin was tasked with drawing up a petition asking the government to grant Manchester two Members of Parliament. As a result, Parliament passed the Reform Act 1832, and the group gave Manchester its first two post-reform MPs: Mark Philips and Charles Poulett Thomson. Richard was elected MP for Wigan in 1832, holding the seat until 1839. Later life Thomas became more involved in the business life of Manchester. Between 1832 and 1835 he led a successful campaign against church rates. After the passing of the Municipal Corporations Act in 1835, Thomas was elected to the Manchester Borough Council and became first Mayor of Manchester between 1838 and 1840. On 1 July 1840 he was granted a knighthood. Personal life Potter married Elizabeth Palmer, daughter of John Westorby Palmer, of York in January 1808. They had two children, Elizabeth and Anne but his wife died in February 1810. After her death he married Esther Bayley daughter of Thomas Bayley of Booth Hall, Blackley in Manchester in September 1812 in the Collegiate Church. They had four children; Esther (born July 1813 and died February 1814), John, Mary (born October 1816 and died March 1817) and Thomas. His second wife died in June 1852 at Buile Hill in Salford and was buried in Ardwick Cemetery in June 1852. In 1818 she founded Lady Potter's Schools at Irlams o' th' Height enabling 80 girls to receive an education. In 1825 Thomas Potter commissioned the architect, Sir Charles Barry, to design him a house at Buile HillThe Georgian Group in Salford. This is the only house where Barry used Greek revival architecture. It was completed in 1827. After the death of Sir Thomas's first son, Sir John Potter, Buile Hill was inherited by Sir Thomas's second son, Thomas Bayley Potter, whose youngest son, Richard Ellis Potter, was born there on 3 October 1855.

He was born in Dublin on 18 December 1829 and died in Holyhead on 14 December 1904. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated with an honours BA in mathematics (1851).http://www.steamindex.com/people/mcdonnell.htm He brought order and standardisation to the workshops and locomotive designs of the Great Southern and Western Railway of Ireland, and was later employed to do the same for the North Eastern Railway in England, although resistance to his changes meant little progress was made before he left. Career McDonnell was apprenticed at Newall and Gordon in Westminster before working as an engineer at the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway ‚Äì later to become part of the Great Western Railway.Alexander McDonnell (at the LNER Encyclopedia) From 1864 to 1883 he was Locomotive, Carriage and Wagon Superintendent of the Great Southern and Western Railway of Ireland at Inchicore. McDonnell reformed the GS&WR; workshop practices and improved their speed and efficiency. He also introduced practices then in use at Crewe Works and standardised parts between locomotive classes. McDonnell was noted for his ability to recognise, and employ, men of talent. By doing this, he initiated the \\"Inchicore school\\" of locomotive engineers, who would include Sir John Aspinall, H.A. Ivatt, and R.E.L. Maunsell. From 1 November 1882, McDonnell was Locomotive Superintendent of the North Eastern Railway (NER) in England; he succeeded Edward Fletcher, who had retired. He found that Fletcher's locomotives, although good, did not use standardised components. McDonnell decided that in future, locomotives would use shared standard parts where possible, and that locomotive design and construction would utilise the practices which he had used at Inchicore. His first locomotive design for the NER, the '38' class 4-4-0, incorporated a number of unpopular features; and some popular features of Fletcher's engines were omitted. Worse, although the new locomotives were larger than Fletcher's most recent designs, they were no more capable. His only other design for the NER, the '59' class 0-6-0, were also unpopular; in this case, the engines were of similar size to Fletcher's most recent 0-6-0, but were less powerful. As a consequence, McDonnell resigned from the NER in September 1884, receiving a year's salary as severance pay. McDonnell was not replaced immediately, the NER's locomotive department then being managed by a committee chaired by Henry Tennant.

After finishing high school, he briefly studied veterinary medicine, however he switched to general medicine following an accident involving his younger brother. He graduated from the University of Oslo in 1973. He describes growing up in a \\"very political household\\" with many political discussions. He describes his parents as well informed about the world and his father specifically as very well read. He describes his mother as an inspiration, who taught him to think critically and awareness about siding with the weak.  Political career  Gilbert's political activism was sparked by the Vietnam War, and he initially became a member of the Solidarity Committee for Vietnam (Solkom). He later joined the Marxist-Leninist SUF(m-l) and the maoist AKP(m-l), and was an active member (the latter party only accepted \\"active membership\\") during the 1970s. He is currently a member of the revolutionary socialist Red Party, and has represented its direct predecessor, the Red Electoral Alliance, the electoral front of the AKP(m-l) in the Troms county council for three terms, from 1979 to 1987 (two terms), and from 1995 to 1999.

On behalf of the government, Under-Secretary of State in the Foreign Ministry B√•rd Glad Pedersen said that \\"Gilbert has for many years played an important role in assisting the Palestinian health care system, and his travels to Gaza are vital to continue this work.\\"https://www.msn.com/nb-no/nyheter/norge/statssekret%C3%A6ren- ringte-ambassad%C3%B8ren-om-gilbert/ar-BBdJiVo The Labour Party secretary Raymond Johansen said that \\"Israel's punishment of medical staff who make a vital contribution in a war situation seems like a desperate act.\\"Krever at Israel-ambassad√∏r m√• inn p√• teppet, 14.11.2014, VG The Israeli government later explained that the ban imposed on Gilbert did not regard the Gaza Strip, but rather Israel, where his presence is regarded as constituting a security problem and that the ban from entering Israel is not necessarily permanent. Given the Egyptian closure of the Rafah passage, the only way to access the Gaza Strip is via an Israeli point of entry, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz commented. Emmanuel Nachson, spokesperson for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, however claimed that Gilbert was \\"welcome in Israel\\", contradicting other claims by Israel. He also denied reports that Gilbert was banned for life from Gaza, saying it was \\"not permanent\\". = Boycott of M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res = Gilbert criticized and encouraged people to boycott M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res in 2006 for not taking a position on conflicts, saying he would \\"not give a dime\\" to the annual Norwegian TV-aksjonen, a national collection charity of the state broadcaster NRK. Previously, in 2001, the leader of the Norwegian branch of M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res had sharply criticised Gilbert for voicing support to the September 11 terror attacks, stating that doctors with \\"such attitudes\\" could \\"never become a member of the organisation\\". On being a doctor as well as a politician, Gilbert has said the two roles are indistinguishable, and that \\"there is little in medicine that isn't politics\\". Gilbert also worked against the training of new Norwegian medical personnel assigned to the ISAF forces in Afghanistan. His activism resulted in the ceasing of training of medical personnel at his medical department, and a following shortfall of qualified doctors in both the Norwegian military force and humanitarian effort in Afghanistan.\\"Legeaksjon mot Afghanistan-tjeneste\\"  Personal life  Since 1974, Gilbert lives in Troms√∏. He explained that upon first seeing the town, he felt \\"intensely\\" that he had come home. He is unmarried and has two daughters. He enjoys kayaking during the summer, and mountaineering during the winter, with the Lyngen Alps his favourite peaks.

The mosque, built in the 7th century, was home to Ali ibn Abi Talib, the 4th Rashidun caliph; and contains the remains of Maytham al-Tammar, Ali's companion; Muslim ibn Aqeel, first cousin of ImƒÅm Husayn ibn Ali, his companion Hani ibn Urwa; and the revolutionary, Al-Mukhtar. In recent history, the mosque has seen numerous renovations primarily under the purview of the Dawoodi Bohras, led by Mufaddal Saifuddin.  Origin  Sources attribute the construction of the Great Mosque of Kufa in the middle of the 7th century to the Caliph Omar. There is a legend that says the edifice was built on a temple constructed by Adam while another claims that Adam's bones were buried on the site, having been carried by Noah on board the Ark. It is also believed that the angel Gabriel was referring to the mosque when he declared, \\"Twelve miles of lands from all directions of the mosque are blessed by its holiness.\\" The site was identified in Shia Islam as the place where Noah must build his Ark. The family members of the first Shiite imams and their early supporters were buried within. Architectural excavations revealed that the mosque, which dates from 670, was built on top of much older foundations. Architecture The area of the building measures approximately . The mosque contains nine sanctuaries and four traditional locations. As to its design, experts recognized similarities to the design of the palaces of pre-Islamic Persia. It has four minarets and is accessible through five gates: Gate of the Threshold ('), Gate of Kinda ('), Gate of al-Anmat ('), Gate of the Snake ()., and Gate of Hani ibn Urwa. Renovation The Great Mosque of Kufa has previously underwent sporadic renovations. One historical account, for instance, noted enlargement of section as well as a raised flooring for the main building in comparison to earlier level. In 1998, head of Dawoodi Bohra community, Late Dr. Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin started renovating the mosque, which was then completed in early 2010. The renovation included decorations with gold and silver, the Mihrab being made with a gold zari, and the whole interior being surrounded with verse of the Quran. In addition, the courtyard is covered in white marble from Makrana, India.

Compared to its predecessors, Oberon and Oberon-2, Active Oberon adds objects (with object-centered access protection and local activity control), system-guarded assertions, preemptive priority scheduling and a changed syntax for methods (aka type-bound procedures in the Oberon terminology). Objects may be active, which means that they may be threads or processes. The operating system A2 aka Bluebottle, especially the kernel, synchronizes and coordinates different active objects.

History  In April, 1902, on the campus of Northeast Missouri State University, four girls formed a \\"friendship club\\". The club grew to nine members and the name T.T.C. was adopted. When the club grew to twelve members, the name was changed to A.O.T. It is reported that one member \\"could not keep her pledge\\", so a more \\"permanent\\" organization was formed. Thus begins the Alpha chapter of Sigma Delta Chi sorority.Ryle (1972), p. 619. In the summer months of 1902, the \\"initiatory and christening service\\" were crafted, along with important documents. In the fall of 1902, the Beta Chapter at Warrensburg Teachers College (Central Missouri) was chartered. Two years later, the Gamma chapter was chartered at Forest Park Academy and Delta at Northwest Missouri State University.Ryle (1972), pp. 619‚Äì620. Conclaves were held every two years, beginning in 1906. The final conclave, in 1912, ruled that the sorority would only charter at normal schools. The Gamma chapter was lost as a result. The Delta chapter dissolved in 1915 per a university ban on secret organizations. Northwest Missouri State University records gave the final date as March 18, 1914.Tower (2000), p. 161. With only two chapters left, members decided to petition a national sorority. In October 1915, Alpha chapter sent a petition to Sigma Sigma Sigma. On November 11, 1915, the Mu chapter of Sigma Sigma Sigma was installed. Ryle's history book stated, \\"All indicators point to a very pleasant evening, yet the girls must have thought of the old Sigma Delta Chi, now taking its place permanently in the history of the college.\\"Ryle (1972), p. 620.  Insignia  The emblem of A.O.T. was a crescent encircling a clover, with the club's initials on the leaves. The pin of Sigma Delta Chi was a gold bow and arrow; the colors turquoise and wine; the flower the white carnation.

His first tutor was Martin de Barcos, the nephew of the Abbot of St. Cyran. He was then sent to the college of Lisieux in order to finish his studies. In his memoirs, he describes himself as a gentle man who could not win the affection of his father, who had high hopes placed upon another of his sons. During his campaign, he showed courage and composure, however, he wrote in his memoirs that luck was not on his side. In 1643, wanting to serve under one of his uncles, he applied for a patent of aide he thought he deserved it, it was however refused. He submitted to the will of his father, but he was not treated any better. Deprived of his support, he turned to his uncle, Henri Arnauld, abbot of Saint-Nicolas, and he followed him to Rome where the priest was sent in 1645. Shortly after, the abbot of Saint-Nicolas was named bishop of Angers. In 1674, Louis XIV conferred on him the abbey of Chaumes-en-Brie which was to his liking because it was in the vicinity of the properties his family. Upon the disgrace of his brother, he withdrew to the residency of the bishop of Angers, in whom he entrusted the administration.

It is one of ten short plays that make up Tonight at 8.30, a cycle written to be performed in groups of three plays across three evenings. The original production, starring Coward and Gertrude Lawrence played in a pre-London tour, and then the West End, and finally New York, in 1935‚Äì1937. We Were Dancing has been revived periodically and was adapted for the cinema in 1942. The play depicts a married woman who falls in love with a divorced man at a dance on a South Pacific island. They plan to go to Australia, but in the cold light of morning, they realise that they have nothing in common and go their separate ways, Background In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Coward wrote a succession of hits, ranging from the operetta Bitter Sweet (1929) and the epic Cavalcade (1931), requiring a large cast, gargantuan sets and a complex hydraulic stage, to the intimate comedies Private Lives (1930), in which Coward starred alongside Gertrude Lawrence, and Design for Living (1932).Hoare, p. 249 Coward said that after Private Lives, he felt that the public enjoyed seeing him and Lawrence together on stage, and so he wrote the play cycle Tonight at 8.30 as \\"acting, singing, and dancing vehicles for Gertrude Lawrence and myself\\".Hoare, pp. 268‚Äì270 In the programme for the London run Coward wrote: We Were Dancing was the first of the Tonight at 8.30 cycle to be presented.

As they leave, Louise Charteris and Karl Sandys waltz in, locked in mutual fascination. They kiss, and are discovered by Louise's husband, Hubert, and his sister Clare. Hubert listens civilly to Karl's protestations of love for Louise, and admits to Karl that he himself is no longer madly in love with Louise after 13 years of marriage, although he still cares for her greatly. The exchange is interrupted by the entrance of Major Blake, looking for his wife, Eva. Clara fobs him off by saying that Eva is with mutual friends, the Baileys and he goes out. Hubert remains concerned that Louise is so sure that she wants to be with a man she has only just met.

They part on good terms and she leaves. Eva Blake and George Davies return furtively from their illicit excursion hoping not to have been missed.

Deployed to Karachi, India; Chakulia, India; and Yangkai, China. While in Calcutta, India, the unit converted to the Douglas A-26 Invader attack bomber. During World War II, the unit earned two Distinguished Unit Citations and participated in nine separate campaigns. Personnel demobilized in India after the war, and the 22d was inactivated as a paper unit in the United States in November 1945. =Strategic Air Command= On 16 June 1950, the 22d Air Refueling Squadron was activated at March Air Force Base, California, flying the Boeing KC-97 Aircraft. The squadron relocated to McChord AFB, WA on 15 June 1960 where it later upgraded to the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker. The squadron was inactivated on 1 July 1962. The Squadron was reactivated at March on 1 July 1963, flying the KC-135 and EC-135 aircraft. In 1962, SAC established an airborne command post at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, nicknamed Looking Glass, to ensure continuity of command and control of SAC forces in the event of a nuclear attack. Looking Glass was soon augmented by auxiliary aircraft stationed with the headquarters of SAC's three Numbered Air Forces. The 22d received Boeing EC-135C aircraft to operate SAC's Western Auxiliary Command Post's airborne element for Fifteenth Air Force. The 22d continued to operate PACCS aircraft until 1 April 1970, when SAC reorganized its airborne command post aircraft and withdrew them from vulnerable bases near the coasts like Westover and assigned them to the 2d, 3d, and 4th Airborne Command and Control Squadrons, stationed at bases closer to the heartland of North America. It was deployed to Andersen AB, Guam whereupon it supported the Vietnam War until mid-1973. The squadron was inactivated on 1 December 1989. On 19 Sep 1985 the 22d Air Refueling Squadron was consolidated with the 22d Bombardment Squadron (Medium), a unit that was last active 2 Nov 1945. This action was directed by Department of the Air Force Letter DAF/MPM 662q Attachment 1 (Active Units), 19 Sep 1985. The Consolidated Unit retained the Designation of 22d Air Refueling Squadron, Heavy. =Mobility unit= Reactivated on 1 October 1992 at Mountain Home AFB, ID, it was assigned seven KC-135R model aircraft as part of the Air Force's first Composite Air Intervention Wing. The squadron was consecutively awarded the 366th Wing's Silver Bolt Award for foreign object damage prevention during fiscal year 1997-1 and 1997‚Äì2, as well ACC's Best Tanker Award for 1993. The squadron garnered the 366th Wing's only \\"Outstanding\\" rating during the July 1995 ORI and its deployed maintenance won the ACC IG Superior Performance Team Award during the 366th Wing's 1997 AEF and first ever combat zone ORI. The 22d ARS was the only squadron in the 366th Wing to display nose art on the entire fleet. It was also awarded the Outstanding Unit Award, 1 June 1998 through 31 May 1999. The squadron was inactivated in 2002. The unit was reactivated as the 22nd Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron in 2003 as an AFCENT provisional squadron deployed to combat areas as part of the Global War on Terrorism in Afghanistan.

The village is situated just off the A38 road between Bromsgrove and Droitwich Spa, and on the River Salwarpe. In the 2001 census, the parish, which also contains the small hamlet of Cooksey Green, had a population of 291. The village, in the south-east corner of the parish, is situated between two major roads, the M5 motorway to the west and the A38 to the east and south. East of the village, on the boundary with Dodderhill, is the Worcestershire Wildlife Trust's Christopher Cadbury Wetland Reserve, a nature reserve and a popular location for birdwatching. The reserve consists of several pools created by subsidence as a result of brine extraction in the area.

It was part of the former Ilkeston borough and is largely regarded today as a part of the much larger town of Ilkeston which adjoins it to the north east. Since 1974 Kirk Hallam has been part of the borough of Erewash. Kirk Hallam is a ward of the Erewash Borough Council showing a population of 6,417 at the 2001 Census, reducing to 6,216 at the 2011 Census. History Kirk Hallam is one of several 'Hallams' in the locality which include West Hallam, Little Hallam and the Hallam Fields area of Ilkeston, all within a few miles. The name 'Halum' appears in the Domesday Book and this may refer to West Hallam, Kirk Hallam or both. In any case, the village is long established. Originally a small agricultural parish, Kirk Hallam's population expanded dramatically in the 1950s and 1960s when large housing developments were carried out, firstly of public sector housing by Ilkeston Corporation and local employer Stanton and Staveley in the 1950s (the 'St Norbert Drive' area to the South) and a mix of public and private housing in the 1960s and 1970s to the north (the 'Godfrey Drive' area). The westernmost part of the 'Godfrey Drive' development is in fact in the parish of Dale Abbey. These two large developments form a rough oval shape, either side of the main Ladywood Road (A6096) from Ilkeston towards Derby. Kirk Hallam's population at the 2001 census was given as 6,417. All Saints' Church Kirk Hallam's Parish Church dates from the late Norman period and until 1539 was administered by Dale Abbey, who provided its priests. The earliest recorded vicar is the monk Simon de Radford in 1298.A history of All Saints' Church Kirk Hallam, by Esther A. Collington He was followed by another fifteen monk vicars up to Roger Page who stayed on as vicar after the Abbey was dissolved. The canons of Dale were largely responsible for turning the heavily forested land around Kirk Hallam into the fertile arable and pasture which predominated up to the 1950s. After the dissolution of Dale Abbey in 1539, the right to appoint vicars (the advowson) in Kirk Hallam eventually passed to the Newdigate family in the mid-18th century. The church was in such a ruined state it was lucky to escape demolition in 1778 and a public subscription organised by the Newdigates in 1858 supplied funds for a substantial and much needed renovation. All Saints' Church is now a Grade I listed building. Schools Kirk Hallam has four schools, Kirk Hallam Community Academy and St John Houghton Catholic Voluntary Academy are secondary schools while Dallimore and Ladywood are primary schools.

Born in Garioch, Farquhar abandoned his medical studies at King's College, Aberdeen to join the British Army as a surgeon during the Seven Years' War. He later worked as an apothecary in London and qualified as a physician, becoming popular with royalty and politicians and receiving a baronetcy for his services. Life Farquhar was born in 1738, the son of Robert Farquhar, the minister at Garioch. His mother was Katherine (n√©e Turing), the daughter of another minister. Farquhar took a degree at King's College, Aberdeen and began to study medicine under James Gregory. In 1760 however he abandoned his medical studies in Edinburgh and Glasgow and joined the 19th Regiment of Foot in the British Army as a surgeon. In 1761, the regiment was sent to Belle √éle and subsequently to Gibraltar, where it remained at the end of the conflict. Farquhar left the regiment at Gibraltar and spent 18 months travelling and studying medicine in France, working with Claude Nicolas le Cat in Rouen. In 1769, citing ill-health, Farquhar retired from the army and moved to London, opening an apothecary shop in Great Marlborough Street with his wife Anne Harvie, widow of a London doctor. Farquhar's practice gradually developed a steady clientele and he became a physician, awarded his MD from King's College, Aberdeen in 1796. He was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and a licenceate of the Royal College of Physicians in the same year. Among Farquhar's clients were many prominent figures of the period, including the Prince of Wales, Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger and prominent politician Lord Melville. This patronage led to him being awarded a baronetcy in 1796 and was soon appointed physician-in-ordinary to the Prince of Wales. With his reputation secured, Farquhar ran a very successful business until his retirement in 1813 with health problems. Farquhar died in London in March 1819 and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields in Westminster. His baronetcy passed to his eldest son, Sir Thomas Harvie Farquhar, 2nd Baronet, although it was his second son Robert Townsend Farquhar who was most successful, becoming the governor of Penang and Mauritius and subsequently a Member of Parliament. In 1821 he was awarded a baronetcy separate to that of his father. Although Sir Walter Farquhar was a very successful physician of his day, he did not publish or develop any medical knowledge and thus he had no lasting impact on British medicine.Farquhar, Sir Walter, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, (subscription required), J.

It was primarily used for advanced combat training of B-25 Mitchell medium bomber units and replacement pilots. It was used as a training base in early 1942 for Doolittle's Raiders. It was closed during the summer of 1945, and turned over for civil use as the Columbia Metropolitan Airport. History Origins = In 1940 the United States Army Air Corps indicated a need for the Lexington County Airport as part of the buildup of its forces after World War II began in Europe. The earliest recorded Air Corps use of the airport was when the 105th Observation Squadron began flying Douglas O-38 and North American O-47 light observation aircraft beginning on 24 September. In 1941, the airport came under formal military control and an immediate construction program began to turn the civil airport into a military airfield. Construction involved runways and airplane hangars, with three concrete runways, several taxiways and a large parking apron and a control tower. Several large hangars were also constructed. Buildings were ultimately utilitarian and quickly assembled. Most base buildings, not meant for long-term use, were constructed of temporary or semi-permanent materials. Although some hangars had steel frames and the occasional brick or tile brick building could be seen, most support buildings sat on concrete foundations but were of frame construction clad in little more than plywood and tar paper. While under construction, the 65th Observation Group used the unfinished facilities at the airfield between 1 September and 1 December 1941, flying a mixture O-47s, O-49 Vigilant and O-52 Owl light observation planes as part of the \\"Carolina Maneuvers\\" in the Fall of 1941 performing reconnaissance and aerial photo duties. =World War II= Doolittle Raid B-25Bs aboard USS Hornet A-26B-15-DL (41-39186) On 8 December 1941, the Columbia Army Airbase was activated with Lt. Colonel Dashe W. Reeves as commander. It was assigned to Third Air Force, III Air Support Command. The 121st Observation Squadron was moved to the new air base from nearby Owens Field, replacing the 105th OS which was sent to Langley Field, Virginia and the Marine Corps airfield at Cherry Point North Carolina to fly antisubmarine patrols. The 121st OS, which had also been flying observation flights as part of the \\"Carolina Maneuvers\\", began antisubmarine patrols over the Atlantic coast using O-47s and L-4 Grasshoppers. The 96th Air Base Squadron was initially assigned as the base host unit for ground support squadrons, being replaced by the 19th Air Base Group in February 1942. The antisubmarine patrol mission was reassigned to Charleston AAF which was much better suited for it, as Charleston was located right on the Atlantic coast. Columbia Army Airfield's mission was changed become a training base for B-25 Mitchell medium bomber aircrews. In addition to the main facility, Columbia AAB had jurisdiction over several satellite and auxiliary airfields in support of the bomber training mission: * Barnwell Army Airfield, Barnwell, South Carolina * Congaree Army Airfield, Eastover * North Army Airfield, North, South Carolina * Walterboro Army Airfield, Walterboro, South Carolina * Johns Island Army Airfield, Johns Island, South Carolina Doolitle Raiders One of the earliest units to train at Columbia AAB was the 17th Bombardment Group, which arrived on 9 February 1942. The squadrons of the 17th Bomb group came to Columbia AAB from Pendleton Field, Oregon to fly antisubmarine patrols off the east coast of the United States. When the group arrived in Columbia its combat crews were offered the opportunity to volunteer for an \\"extremely hazardous\\" but unspecified mission which ultimately turned out to be the famous Doolittle Raid on Japan. On 17 February, 24 full combat crews from amongst the group were detached from Eighth Air Force and transferred to Eglin Field, Florida where they received intensive training for three weeks in simulated carrier deck takeoffs, low-level and night flying, low altitude bombing, and over water navigation. Contrary to popular belief, the volunteers who made up the crews of the Doolittle Raid did not train for the Raid itself at Columbia. B-25 Combat Crew Training The 21st Bombardment Group became the B-25 Operational training unit at Columbia on 21 April 1942, until the unit was reassigned organizationally to Key Field, Mississippi on 22 May. The 21st was replaced by the 309th Bombardment Group, which exchanged designations with the 21st, being reassigned from Key Field. The 329th Bomb Group (and its successor designations) was the major operational training unit (OTU) at Columbia AAB during World War II, providing crew and replacement training in B-25s until 1 May 1944 when the 309th was re-designated as the 329th Bombardment Group. It was subsequently re-designated as the 329th Army Air Force Base Replacement Unit on 1 August 1944. Known B-25 Groups that trained at Columbia AAB were: * 310th Bombardment Group, 16 May-14 August 1942 * 321st Bombardment Group, 1 August‚ÄìSeptember 1942 * 340th Bombardment Group, 20 August-20 November 1942 Beginning in 1943, the 309th performed replacement training, rather than group training. On 1 October 1944, Columbia AAB was reassigned to III Bomber Command, and the training units were again re- designated as the Columbia Combat Crew Training Depot (Medium Bombardment). All sub-bases and satellite airfields were either reassigned or inactivated. On 1 February 1945, Columbia was relieved from assignment to Third Air Force, and was transferred to First Air Force. The base unit was re-designated as the 129th Army Air Force Base Unit (Combat Crew Training Station) (Light), and the mission was changed from training B-25 crews to A-26 Invader Light bombardment crews. The 319th Bombardment Group (light) arrived at Columbia on 28 February 1945 from Twelfth Air Force in Italy for conversion training from B-25s to A-26s. The group left for Okinawa on 27 April 1945. Training at Columbia Army Air Base was phased down during the summer of 1945. Several units arrived at the base from overseas to inactivate during September and October. It was inactivated on 30 November and returned to civil authorities, which converted it back to an airport, however, the 350th Bombardment Squadron was assigned to Columbia Metropolitan Airport on 16 July 1947 as part of the Air Force Reserve, but it was never equipped or manned. It was inactivated on 27 June 1949 File:Columbia-aab-photo-3.jpgColumbia Army Air Base historical marker File:Columbia-aab-photo-1.jpgBombardment Groups historical marker File:Columbia-aab-photo-2.jpg319th Bombardment Group historical marker File:Columbia-aab-photo-6.jpgThe Doolittle Raiders historical marker Lake Murray B-25 Bomber On 19 September 2005, a North American B-25C Mitchell medium bomber (AAF Ser. No. 41-12634 (c/n 82-5269)) was recovered from Lake Murray, about fourteen miles northwest of Columbia Army Airfield. It crashed into Lake Murray on 4 April 1943 due to engine failure. All of its crewmen were able to abandon the plane and were picked up by local fishermen as the plane sank to the bottom in about 100 feet of water. The starboard engine was ripped off in the crash and landed elsewhere, but it was also recovered by divers in 2005. During the war, Air Force records indicate that 23 B-25s crashed into the lake during training missions, many at night with very inexperienced crews. Many of the airmen in these bombers were killed in these training accidents. The B-25 recovered from the lake was later shipped to the Southern Museum of Flight, Birmingham, Alabama to undergo preservation (not restoration). In December 2005 the front section went on display there. See also * South Carolina World War II Army Airfields References * Maurer, Maurer (1983). Air Force Combat Units Of World War II.

It is situated about 110 km northwest of Polokwane and Mokopane. Many former residents of Mat≈°it≈°ileng have moved to urban areas such as Mokopane, Polokwane, Tshwane, Ekurhuleni, Johannesburg and other urban centres. Mat≈°it≈°ileng continues to rely on traditional farming and livestock farming. Demographics The language spoken in Mat≈°it≈°ileng is Northern Sotho (commonly referred to as \\"Sepedi\\"). Although there is some ethnic diversity, like Tsongas (the Ndlovus, Mokwenas and the like), most of the people call themselves Bakone under Kgosi Matlala in Bavaria Ga-Mathapo, though he is not the King of Mat≈°it≈°ileng. The bona- fide king of the village is Kgo≈°i Mmat≈°haka of the Batlokwa tribe, though the inhabitants of Mat≈°it≈°ileng respect Kgo≈°i Matlala for his position as a King of the Matlala area. On 27 December 2016, the people of Mat≈°it≈°ileng went to the polls and elected Mr Lesetja Modiba (commonly known as \\"Afrika\\") to be their new Induna for a fixed term of five years. Schools * Mafasa High School * Ratinke Primary School, formerly known as Mat≈°it≈°ileng Community Comprehensive School The people of Mat≈°it≈°ileng have embraced education as the key factor to the success of every family. However, there are no institutions of higher learning in Mat≈°it≈°ileng. Those who wish to further their studies have to go to Mahwelereng or Seshego for a teacher's diploma, or Mankweng for the University of Limpopo (Turfloop campus) for other qualifications, while some opt for Gauteng and job hunting. Employment Seventy-eight percent of the people in Matjitjileng are teachers, 6% in the military, 2% police, 2% health, 2% other and 10% unemployed (stats to be verified). Infrastructure There is some infrastructure in Matjitjileng. The roads are mostly graveled roads and some were created by cattle tracks over centuries. There is one visible road that crosses Matjitjileng from Ga-Thapedi supermarket and post office. Mat≈°it≈°ileng does not have a source of water like a river. Back in the days before people started having their own boreholes, they used to get water from the local well next to the famous Ga-Mahlatjie property (sedibeng) and the community borehole (pomping ya setshaba). Now there is a water supply, thanks to a government initiative. Ga-Thapedi was a white-owned store where the locals used to buy anything from salt to school uniforms, wedding gowns and suits. It was known as Treves as it was a postal area code. The post office has now been moved to Ga-Mathapo, but the postal code (0618) still remains the same.

Early life Campbell was born in New York City on March 25, 1900. Campbell received an Artium Baccalaureus from Columbia University in 1924. Career He worked as an accountant at Lingley, Baird, and Dixon from 1925 until 1927. He was an assistant comptroller and a comptroller at The Valspar Corporation between 1927 and 1932. He was a partner at R. T. Lingley & Co. in 1932 and 1933. He became a CPA in New York State and Connecticut in 1933. He was a partner at Joseph Campbell & Co. from 1933 until 1941. He served as an assistant treasurer at Columbia University beginning in 1941 and on March 13, 1949 was elected Treasurer by the Board of Trustees. He was the tenth Treasurer in the history of the university. During the early 1950s Campbell served as a member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission and in several other capacities within the federal government. When Comptroller General Lindsay Carter Warren retired Congress was deadlocked over selecting a replacement, so President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Campbell with whom he was familiar with due to Eisenhower's term of presidency at Columbia University. Campbell departed the office before his 15-year term of office concluded due to health issues. Personal life His first marriage was to Marjorie Louise Goetze (d. 1973) on September 1, 1925. She later served as president of the board of governors for the Mansfield Training School. Together the couple had five boys: * Frederick Campbell (1927‚Äì2007), who married Patricia Miller and Charlotte O'Loughlin. * Douglas Goetze Campbell (1928‚Äì2018), who married Sandra Woodworth, daughter of Wade Woodworth. * Robert Goetze Campbell, a physician who married Barbara Helen Yoder. * Alan Goetze Campbell, who married Jennie Reed Fowlkes, daughter of Francis Meriwether Fowlkes. * Colin Goetze Campbell (b. 1935), who served as president of Wesleyan University, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and president and chair of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. Colin married Nancy Nash, who later served as chair of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In 1950, he married artist and philanthropist Dorothy Stokes Bostwick. Dorothy, the daughter of Albert Carlton Bostwick and granddaughter of Standard Oil founding shareholder, Jabez A. Bostwick, was previously married to W. T.

Originally written as a replacement for the state song, \\"Old Folks at Home\\" (\\"Swanee River\\"), it was instead designated as the state's anthem in 2008. Background Florida, which became a U.S. state in 1845, did not have a state song until 1913. On May 12, 1913, Governor Park Trammell signed a bill which designated \\"Florida, My Florida\\" as the state song. \\"Florida, My Florida\\" was sung to the tune of the German Christmas song \\"O Tannenbaum\\", whose tune was also used for the official state songs of Maryland (\\"Maryland, My Maryland\\") and Iowa (\\"The Song of Iowa\\"), and for the unofficial state song of Michigan (\\"Michigan, My Michigan\\"). In 1935, a resolution changed the state song to \\"Swannee River\\" . \\"Old Folks at Home,\\" (also known as \\"Swanee River\\", \\"Swanee Ribber\\" [from the original lyrics], or \\"Suwannee River\\") is a minstrel song written by Stephen Foster in 1851. It has lyrics which are widely considered to be racist, with lines such as \\"longing for de old plantation\\" and \\"Oh! darkies how my heart grows weary\\"; The state Department of Education had altered the lyrics in the 1970s for performance in schools, but the official lyrics still contained the racially unacceptable verbiage. In 1983, then-governor Bob Graham suggested adding another, more upbeat state song. In 1997, state Representative Willie Logan introduced a bill to change the song, citing the offensive nature of the lyrics; the bill was strongly opposed by lawmakers who represented the Suwannee River region, and ultimately was withdrawn by Logan. New song sought In 2007, Charlie Crist refused to allow \\"Old Folks at Home\\" to be played at his gubernatorial inauguration, opting for a less controversial and more contemporary piece. He encouraged state Senator Tony Hill, who was the leader of the legislature's Black Caucus, to find a new song. Hill joined forces with state Representative Ed Homan and the Florida Music Educators Association to sponsor a contest for a new state song. Selection of new song The contest received 243 submissions. After narrowing the field down to three finalists, the nominees were voted upon by the general public at a site set up specifically for the contest. \\"Florida (Where the Sawgrass Meets the Sky)\\", composed by Briton Jan Hinton, received more than half of all of the votes cast. Ironically, neither Foster nor Hinton were Florida natives, but Hinton lived in Florida while Foster never visited the state whose official song he wrote. Hinton had emigrated to Florida a dozen years before she wrote \\"Florida (Where the Sawgrass Meets the Sky). Senator Hill introduced SB 1558, which would designate Hinton's contribution as the new state song. Debate and compromise However, similar to the response in 1997, the bill met opposition from northern Florida historians who felt that the new song denied Florida's heritage. Senator Nancy Argenziano stated \\"A lot of people have expressed to me they don‚Äôt agree with the old lyrics which we don‚Äôt use anymore. But Suwannee River is a big part of Florida. While the old lyrics are very objectionable, they haven‚Äôt been used. I‚Äôm trying to listen to my constituents and they really believe you shouldn‚Äôt change that song. So I have a hard time with that one.\\" Senator Jim King suggested a compromise, in which \\"Florida (Where the Sawgrass Meets the Sky)\\" was designated as the State Anthem, and a Bowdlerized version of \\"Old Folks at Home\\" remained as the state song. The new lyrics of \\"Old Folks at Home\\" were approved by scholars at the Stephen Foster Memorial at the University of Pittsburgh. Governor Crist stated that he was not pleased by the \\"two songs\\" decision, but signed the bill, creating a new state anthem and establishing the reworded version of \\"Old Folks at Home\\" as the State Song under state statute, rather than by resolution, like the 1935 decision. Lyrics Florida, where the sawgrass meets the sky, Florida, where our hearts will ever lie, Sitting proud in the ocean like a sentinel true, Always shielding your own, yet giving welcome. Florida, land of flowers, land of light. Florida, where our dreams can all take flight. Whether youth's vibrant morning or the twilight of years, There are treasures for all who venture here in Florida. Mockingbirds cry and 'gators lie out in the sun, Bridges span southward to the Keys and rockets skyward run, The orange blossoms' sweet perfume and fireworks fill the air, And cultures rich our native people share. Florida, where the sawgrass meets the sky, Florida, where our hearts will ever lie, Sitting proud in the ocean like a sentinel true, Always shielding your own, yet giving welcome. Florida, land of flowers, land of light. Florida, where our dreams can all take flight. Whether youth's vibrant morning or the twilight of years, There are treasures for all who venture here in Florida, Florida.

The maximum of a sample of iid random variables after proper renormalization can only converge in distribution to one of 3 possible distributions, the Gumbel distribution, the Fr√©chet distribution, or the Weibull distribution. Credit for the extreme value theorem and its convergence details are given to Fr√©chet (1927), Ronald Fisher and Leonard Henry Caleb Tippett (1928), Mises (1936) and Gnedenko (1943). The role of the extremal types theorem for maxima is similar to that of central limit theorem for averages, except that the central limit theorem applies to the average of a sample from any distribution with finite variance, while the Fisher‚ÄìTippet‚ÄìGnedenko theorem only states that if the distribution of a normalized maximum converges, then the limit has to be one of a particular class of distributions. It does not state that the distribution of the normalized maximum does converge. Statement Let X_1,X_2,\\\\ldots, X_n be a sequence of independent and identically-distributed random variables with cumulative distribution function F. Suppose that there exist two sequences of real numbers a_n > 0 and b_n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} such that the following limits converge to a non-degenerate distribution function: : \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}P\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\max\\\\\\\\{X_1, \\\\dots, X_n\\\\\\\\}-b_n}{a_n}\\\\leq x\\\\right) = G(x), or equivalently: : \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}F^n\\\\left(a_n x + b_n \\\\right) = G(x). In such circumstances, the limit distribution G belongs to either the Gumbel, the Fr√©chet or the Weibull family. In other words, if the limit above converges we will have G(x) assume the form: :G_{\\\\gamma, a, b}\\\\left( x \\\\right) = \\\\exp\\\\left(-(1 + \\\\gamma \\\\, x_{a,b})^{-1/\\\\gamma} \\\\right), \\\\;\\\\; x_{a,b} = \\\\frac{x - b}{a}, \\\\;\\\\; 1 + \\\\gamma \\\\, x_{a,b} > 0 for some parameters \\\\gamma, a, b. Remarkably, the right hand side is the cumulative distribution function of the generalized extreme value distribution (GEV) with extreme value index \\\\gamma, scale parameter a and location parameter b. The GEV distribution groups the Gumbel, Fr√©chet and Weibull distributions into a single one. Conditions of convergence The Fisher‚ÄìTippett‚ÄìGnedenko theorem is a statement about the convergence of the limiting distribution G(x) above. The study of conditions for convergence of G to particular cases of the generalized extreme value distribution began with Mises, R. (1936) and was further developed by Gnedenko, B. V. (1943). Let F be the distribution function of X, and X_1, \\\\dots, X_n an i.i.d. sample thereof. Also let x^* be the populational maximum, i.e. x^* = \\\\sup\\\\\\\\{ x \\\\mid F(x) < 1 \\\\\\\\}. The limiting distribution of the normalized sample maximum, given by G above, will then be: *A Fr√©chet distribution (\\\\gamma > 0) if and only if x^* = \\\\infty and \\\\lim_{t \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\frac{1-F(tx)}{1-F(t)} = x^{-1 / \\\\gamma} for all x > 0. :In this case, possible sequences that will satisfy the theorem conditions are b_n = 0 and a_n=F^{-1}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right). *A Weibull distribution (\\\\gamma < 0) if and only if x^* is finite and \\\\lim_{t \\\\rightarrow 0^+} \\\\frac{1-F(x^* - tx)}{1 - F(x^* - t)} = x^{-1/\\\\gamma} for all x>0. : Possible sequences here are b_n = x^* and a_n=x^* - F^{-1}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right). *A Gumbel distribution (\\\\gamma = 0) if and only if \\\\lim_{t \\\\rightarrow 0^-} \\\\frac{1 - F(t + xf(t))}{1 - F(t)} = e^{-x} with f(t) := \\\\frac{\\\\int_t^{x^*} 1 - F(s) ds}{1 - F(t)}. : Possible sequences here are b_n = F^{-1}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right) and a_n = f\\\\left(F^{-1}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right)\\\\right).

Violacein has antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties. Its antifungal properties are of particular interest, since J. lividum is found on the skin of certain amphibians, including the red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus), where it prevents infection by the devastating chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis).Small Things Considered: What You Don't Know About Janthinobacterium Etymology The genus name, Janthinobacterium, comes from Latin janthinus, which means \\"violet\\" or \\"violet-blue\\" + bacterium, which means rod or staff. The species name is also from Latin, lividum, which means \\"of a blue or leaden color\\".Ibid.  Antifungal properties  This bacterium produces antifungal compounds, such as indole-3-carboxaldehyde and violacein.  Resistance to B. dendrobatidis  J. lividum inhibits the toxic effect and growth of the fungal genus Batrachochytrium. This fungus causes a disease known as chytridiomycosis in amphibians, and is contributing to the massive declines of amphibians around the world, so understanding the uses of these bacteria has been of major interest. A study conducted in 2009 explored the effects of Bd and the use of J. lividium in the lab for survival. The three experimental treatments were: frogs infected with Bd, frogs given the bacterium J. lividium, and frogs with the given bacterium and then exposed to Bd. Nearly all of the frogs exposed to Bd alone experienced mortality, while none of the other treatments had any deaths. This effectively introduced the use of J. lividium as a possible method for Bd prevention in the lab setting.  Textile dyeing  The pigment produced by J. lividum is also being used to colour textile. The biodegradable pigment could be an alternative to synthetic textile dyes that contain harmful chemicals and heavy metals.

Biography Goldie was educated at Wolverhampton Grammar School and then read mathematics at St John's College, Cambridge. His studies were interrupted by war work on ballistics with the Armament Research Department of the Ministry of Supply, eventually taking his BA in 1942 and MA in 1946. Academic career Goldie became an assistant lecturer at the University of Nottingham in 1946. In 1948 he was appointed lecturer in Pure Mathematics at what was then King's College, Durham (and has been the University of Newcastle upon Tyne since 1963) where he was promoted to senior lecturer in 1958 and reader in algebra in 1960. In 1963 Goldie was appointed Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of Leeds. He retired from his chair in 1986 with the title emeritus professor. Goldie won the 1970 Senior Berwick Prize from the London Mathematical Society, where he also served as vice-president from 1978 to 1980. Goldie worked in ring theory, where he introduced the notion of the uniform dimension of a module, and the reduced rank of a module. He is well known for Goldie's theorem, which characterizes right Goldie rings. Indeed, his Independent obituary described him as the \\"Lord of the Rings\\". Personal life Goldie married Mary Kenyon in 1944. They had three children (from eldest to youngest): Isobel (Carlyle), Helen, and John. Both Isobel and Helen completed PhDs in Geography, while John completed a degree in Music. Mary died in 1995 and in 2002 he married Margaret Turner, who survived him.

He was born in Milnsbridge into a wealthy Yorkshire family in 1900, the heir to a successful textiles business which funded his motor racing and other sporting exploits. He is famous for being the only driver to successfully complete the full 24 hours of the 24 Hours of Le Mans race solo, a feat he achieved in 1950. He lived at Kirkburton, near Huddersfield until leaving the United Kingdom on his retirement in the early 1950s to live, initially in South Africa, later in Canada and then Monte Carlo, where he had an apartment overlooking the harbour and part of the Grand Prix circuit. He was married twice, first to Evelyn Muriel (divorced in 1931) and secondly in 1933 to divorc√©e Joan Evelyn Quarmby (n√©e Goddard) who survived him on his death in 1982. Racing career Hall started motor racing in 1922 and was a prolific amateur competitor at many venues including Donington Park, Shelsley Walsh, the Isle of Man and the Mille Miglia until his retirement in 1951. He favoured races that demanded stamina and is mostly remembered today for his multiple drives in the 410-mile (478 from 1933) RAC Tourist Trophy (TT) in Ulster, where he competed every year it was held there (1928 to 1936). In 1960, he presented a perpetual trophy to the B.A.R.C. for the annual winner of their Formula Junior Championship winner (later Formula 3). =Ards TT= The TT was brought to Ireland by industrialist and pioneer of the modern agricultural tractor, Harry Ferguson, and was the largest sporting event in the area at the time, regularly attracting more than quarter of a million spectators. It took place on a closed road circuit encompassing Newtownards, Comber and Dundonald in County Down, Northern Ireland. Like many others at the time it was run on a handicap basis so that cars of very different sizes and performances were able to compete in the same race, which although difficult for spectators to follow during the race did provide some close finishes. In Hall's first TT race in 1928, he drove a 2-litre Lagonda 14/60 Speed model, which ran out of oil and seized causing his retirement from the race just a few laps from the end. In the 1929 race he fared no better, crashing his supercharged Arrol-Aster 17/50 into Ards town hall. 1930 saw him driving an unsupercharged Bentley 4¬Ω Litre and finishing the race for the first time, second in class and twelfth overall. In 1931 he drove a supercharged 746cc MG Midget, again retiring with engine failure, but in the 1932 race in the same model of car he finished first in class and third overall. His performance in 1933 in a supercharged MG K3 Magnette was similar, achieving second in class and fourth overall in a race won by Tazio Nuvolari. For 1934 he asked Rolls- Royce to modify a Bentley 3¬Ω-litre, which they initially refused to do because the company had long since quit racing. Reasoning that as this car was a private entry failure would not reflect badly on the factory, however, Rolls- Royce assisted Hall by increasing the output of his engine from the standard 114 bhp to a more useful 131 bhp. It was the first competition car built at Rolls-Royce since the car built for Charles Rolls which he had driven to win the 1906 TT, and it was also their last. The heavy Bentley was not ideally suited to the tricky street circuit at Ards, but when the series came to an end in 1936 Hall had accumulated 3 second places in it (1934, 1935 and 1936), each time setting the fastest race pace (78.40 mph, 80.36 mph and 80.81 mph respectively), and each time defeated only by the handicap system. The final version of the car had a 4¬º-litre engine producing over 160 bhp and a 40-gallon fuel tank behind the seats, enabling him to complete the distance without stopping. He was one of only two men to have competed in every running of the Ards TT, the other being Earl Howe. =BRDC= Hall was elected to the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC) in 1932 and was awarded their Gold Star in 1933 for his performance at Brooklands when he raced the BRDC 500 Mile Race in a Bentley 4¬Ω Litre, partnered by Dr D.J. Benjafield, and came second on handicap. Theirs was the fastest car in the race, at 112.12 mph. In the BRDC 500 at Brooklands in 1933, Hall drove a works MG K3 Magnette with streamlined bodywork and with his then girlfriend (later second wife), Joan, acting as team Manager and controlling the race from the pits. Together they worked out a novel method of pit control, combining steady driving (calculated to enable the car to outlast its competitors) with a single efficiently-managed pitstop, and these two factors together allowed him to take a famous victory. =Le Mans= Hall had entered the 4¬º-litre Bentley into the Le Mans 24-hour race in 1936, but the race was cancelled due to economic conditions and labour difficulties. There was a swansong performance for that car, however, when Hall drove it in the second post-war Le Mans 24-hour race in 1950, becoming the first (and only) man to drive solo for the entire distance, despite having a co-driver in the pits ready to take over. He completed 236 laps, which equals to nearly 3,200 km (2,000 miles). When asked by Denis Jenkinson what the toilet arrangements were if he never left the cockpit for 24 hours, Hall replied \\"Green overalls, old boy!\\" His final international event was in the 1951 Le Mans race, driving a 4.1-litre Ferrari 340 America Barchetta. He completed 125 laps before being forced to retire with electrical problems. Photography Hall was also a photographer and published a book on the subject of Modern Figure Skating in 1938. The photographic plates consist of action shots of skaters (taken during the European Figure Skating Championships in St Moritz), and a combination of formal and impromptu portraits. T.D. Richardson, author of Modern Figure Skating and Ice Rink Skating, wrote in the introduction to Hall's book \\"it was highly entertaining to see Mr Hall laden with cameras and gadgets, prowling round the rinks, stalking his prey in the hope of catching a new or unusual angle or lying flat on his tummy for hours, so that he might get a single shot. Young skaters are often possessed of 'temperaments', but Mr Hall's patience and good humour overcame all difficulties.\\" Bobsleigh Hall was a member of the victorious Great Britain two-man and five-man bobsleigh crews at the 1927 European Bobsleigh Championship in St. Moritz, and also contested the 1928 Winter Olympics in the Number 2 Great Britain five-man bobsleigh, finishing ninth overall and ahead of the Number 1 Great Britain team.

Redesignated 88th Observation Squadron in 1921 the squadron moved from Langley to support Army ground forces at Fort Campbell, Kentucky; then to Texas in 1927 at Brooks Field to patrol the Mexican Border; to Oklahoma in 1928 to support Fort Sill, then back to Brooks Field in 1931. Squadron moved to California in 1935 and was assigned to the new Hamilton Field near San Francisco, as part of the 12th Observation Group. Became a coastal patrol squadron operating amphibian aircraft, then began to operate modern Martin B-10 bombers in 1936 in the reconnaissance mission when attached as the fourth squadron of the 7th Bombardment Group, 1st Wing, General Headquarters Air Force. The squadron dropped food and supplies and flew photographic missions in connection with flood-relief operations in central California, 12‚Äì13 December 1937; upgraded to the B-18 Bolo in 1938, and in 1939 to early-model Boeing B-17B Flying Fortress for long range reconnaissance patrols. Moved to Fort Douglas, Utah in 1940 when the short runways at Hamilton proved inadequate for B-17 operations, with a secondary move to Salt Lake City Army Air Base in January 1941 where it was upgraded to the B-17E. In October 1941, was ordered to Clark Field, Philippines Commonwealth to build up forces there due to increased tensions between the United States and the Japanese Empire. Due to a lack of planes, some pilots were sent to Seattle to fly new B-17s overseas while the remainder departed on 12 November from Salt Lake City, by train, arriving at Angel Island by ferry; They remained at Angel Island until 20 November, now bound for Hickam Field, Hawaii Territory, on the troopship 'Republic'. The 'Republic' arrived 28 November. After an overnight refueling, they reboarded the 'Republic'; just outside Pearl Harbor they joined a convoy of 13 Freighters and an escort of a light cruiser the \\"Pensacola\\" bound for the Philippines, this was also known as the 'Pensacola Convoy'. 7 December they had reached the Equator. Hearing the news of the attack on Pearl Harbor, they changed course, from the Philippines, now re- directed to Brisbane, Australia via Suva, Fiji. The B-17s ended up coming in under attack during their arrival at Hickam on 7 December. Some of the planes managed to land at Haleiwa Fighter Strip, one set down on a golf course, and the remainder landed at Hickam under the strafing of Japanese planes. =World War II= 436th B-24J Liberator unloading fuel after flying \\"The Hump\\"Aircraft is B-24J-185-CO Liberator, serial 44-40852. Taken at 1944 Kunming, China on 6 September 1944. After the Pearl Harbor Attack, the surviving aircraft operated from Hawaii until February 1942, becoming part of the air defense forces of the Territory. Moved to Australia with the 7th Bomb Group where the squadron reformed in northern Queensland in late February. Became part of the new Fifth Air Force. Moved to Java in the Dutch East Indies an attempt to stop the Japanese advance, however the small force of B-17s could do very little to stem the tide of the Japanese advance, launching valiant but futile attacks against the masses of Japanese shipping and returned to RAAF Townsville in early March. Redesignated as the 436th Bombardment Squadron in April 1942 and left its B-17Es in Australia, being reassigned to the new Tenth Air Force in India where it was re-equipped with long-range Consolidated B-24D Liberators. For the balance of the war, carried out long distance heavy bomb raids over Japanese targets primarily in Burma, Thailand and Indochina; a theater with little news coverage, see China Burma India Theater; although also attacked Japanese targets in Southeastern China attacking airfields, fuel and supply dumps, locomotive works, railways, bridges, docks, warehouses, shipping, and troop concentrations in Burma and struck oil refineries in Thailand, power plants in China and enemy shipping in the Andaman Sea. (A more complete account is available in Lt Col (Ret) William Henderson's book, \\"From China Burma India to the River Kwai\\") Ceased bombing operations in late May 1945 and was attached to the Air Transport Command to haul gasoline from India over the Himalayas to China. Squadron demobilized in India, leaving B-24s to Indian Colonial forces, inactivated as a paper unit in the United States in early 1946. =Strategic Air Command= Reactivated in 1946 as a B-29 Superfortress bombardment squadron and trained in global bombardment operations flying simulated bombing missions over various cities, as well as performing intercontinental training missions over the Pacific and later to Europe. In June 1948 the first Consolidated B-36A Peacekeeper was delivered. Operated B-36s until 1958 when the squadron began conversion to the B-52 Stratoforterss. In 1959 was reassigned to SAC provisional 4238th Strategic Wing, being re-equipped with B-52F Stratofortress intercontinental heavy bombers. Was reassigned to Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana by SAC to disperse its heavy bomber force. Conducted worldwide strategic bombardment training missions and providing nuclear deterrent. Was inactivated in 1963 when SAC inactivated its provisional Strategic Wings, redesignating them permanent Air Force Wings. Squadron was inactivated with aircraft/personnel/equipment being redesignated 20th Bombardment Squadron in an in-place, name-only transfer. =Training operations= Reactivated in as the 436th Strategic Training Squadron at Carswell Air Force Base, Texas to provide training on the Boeing B-52H Stratofortress. The squadron supported the SAC mission through classroom instruction, multimedia production, and training aid fabrication. Due to a realignment of major commands in the Air Force in June 1992, the was reassigned to Air Combat Command and became the 436th Training Squadron. In 1993, the squadron and the 7th Wing moved to Dyess Air Force Base,texas as Carswell became a joint reserve base. The squadron continues to provide classroom instruction for over 10 courses to students from every major command and multimedia productions used throughout the Department of Defense.

Bereket is the administrative centre of the Bereket District. Bereket is located in an oasis in the foothills of the Kopetdag Mountains and on the edge of the Karakum Desert. Bereket is an important strategic railway intersection of the Trans-Caspian Railway (Caspian Sea-Turkmenistan-Uzbekistan-Kazakhstan) and North-South Transnational Railway (Russia-Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan-Iran-Persian Gulf. The city has a large locomotive repair depot and a modern railway station. The city is located approximately west of the Turkmen capital of Ashgabat and east of the Caspian Sea port of Turkmenbashi. The largest cities nearby are Balkanabat to the west, and Serdar to the east. The estimated population of the city is 24,500 as of March 2015.  Etymology  The exact origin of the name is unknown. Gazanjyk is probably derived from a Turkic language word gazan or kazan (meaning a large cooking pot used throughout Central Asia, roughly equivalent to a cauldron, boiler) and -jyk a suffix to denote small in size. The name can be translated into English as small kazan or small cauldron. The present-day name of the city Bereket in the Turkmen language means abundance or prosperity. The word Bereket is borrowed from the Persian word Barakat (ÿ®ÿ±⁄©ÿ™) into Turkmen. Persian in turn has borrowed it from Arabic Barakah (ÿ®ÿ±⁄©ÿ©).  History  Since ancient times the area where city is now located was known as an important junction on the famous Silk Road that connected China with the Middle East and Europe. Aleksey Kuropatkin, the Imperial Russian Army commander of the Turkestan Rifle Brigade, who made an 18-day march in 1880‚Äì1881 across of Karakum desert writes in his memoirs \\"the 5th transition to Kazandjik ‚Äì . A waterless road. The soil is sandy, clayey, alkaline; there are sparse clumps of weeds and even sparser haloxylon trees four feet in height. This transition separates the Balkan mountains from Kyurendag. Kazandjik wells lie in the gorge of the Kyurendag mountains, along the stream of a small river. Water in the wells is fresh and of good quality.\\" After the conquest of the Transcaspian Oblast the Russian Empire started to build the Trans-Caspian railway including towns and settlements along the route. Kazandjik, as an urban city, was founded in 1895 to serve as an important junction on the railway. In 1916‚Äì1942 Kazandjik and the area around the town was the scene of furious battles between Russian Imperial forces, and after 1918 Soviet Red Army, with local nationalist Muslims, during the Basmachi movement. During Soviet period the 61631th army garrison had been built on the outskirts of the city. In 1988 it had stationed strong army units, the 231th tank regiment, the 160th motorized rifle regiment and the 405th artillery regiment. The December 2000 Turkmenistan earthquake (7.0 on the moment magnitude scale) devastated the city center. Geography Kopetdag mountains in early spring, a view from Bereket city. See satellite image of Bereket. The city is located on the most western foothills of the Kopetdag mountains called Kyurendag on the edge of the Karakum deserts. The maximum height of the Kyurendag ridge is . The vegetation of the ridge is quite poor and is represented primarily by species of desert flora, sagebrush, semi-desert and dry steppe and rocky outcrops. Soils ‚Äì gray soils. One can occasionally find juniper trees, single or large groups of tamarisk and small shrubs. Wildlife in recent years has become greatly impoverished. Ungulates are few in number. Argali sheep are seen occasionally, as are bezoar goats and wild boars, gazelles. Predators includewolves, jackals, foxes, hyenas. Among birds klik are rarely seen and stone curlews and jacks very rarely. Reptile species are represented by the steppe tortoise, monitor lizard, boa, agam, etc. The major source of water for irrigation is the Karakum Canal. Demographics The city is divided into several aul ‚Äì neighborhoods. The majority of the inhabitants are Turkmen from the Yomud tribes, with a minority of Teke. Previously strong communities of Azeris, Armenians, Russians, Ukrainians and Persians are now reduced to several families. In the 1990s most of them migrated to larger cities for better economic opportunities. Many Russian families also emigrated to the Russian Federation.

It links Uzen in Kazakhstan with Bereket ‚Äì Etrek in Turkmenistan and ends at Gorgan in Iran's Golestan province. In Iran, the railway will be linked to the national network making its way to the ports of the Persian Gulf. The project is estimated to cost $620m which is being jointly funded by the governments of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Iran. In May 2013, the Bereket ‚Äì Uzen section of the North- South Transnational Railway was completed. In February 2014 long section between Bereket and Etrek was completed.

It is an abrupt rise above the ground of peninsular gneiss as the main rock formation and with an assessed age of about 3,000 million years. Bugle Rock has generated wide interest among the scientific community. Kempe Gowda II (who came to power in 1585), the feudal ruler of Bangalore, is credited with building four watchtowers setting limits for Bangalore's expansion, which included a tower on the Bugle Rock (on the southern boundary) as it commands a panoramic view of Bangalore city. It is said that at sunset a sentry would blow the bugle and hold a torch (Kannada:panju) which was visible from the other three watch towers (one on the southern bank of the Kempambudi tank on the west, the second near Ulsoor Lake in the east and the third tower adjoining Ramana Maharshi Ashram on Bellary Road, namely Mekhri Circle in the north). This was done to inform people that everything was safe at that location and to give a warning bugle call to alert the citizens of any intruders into the city. Most of the rocks on the Bugle Rock, next to the Bull Temple, have hollows, which were once used to light lamps. This landmark spreads over an area of . This rock is contiguous and similar to the rock at Lalbagh tower. Geological age of rock South India is endowed with one of the oldest land formations on earth, namely the Gondwanas of Archaean age. The massive rock exposure at Lal Bagh, which is adjacent to the Bugle Rock exposure, was first examined in 1916 by Dr. W.F. Smeeth of the then-Mysore Geological Department who classified this rock as \\"peninsular gneiss.\\" The antiquity of the rock formation has generated innumerable scientific papers from geologists of the then Mysore Geological Department, the Geological Survey of India (GSI) and the scholars from related academies and institutions abroad. The scientific study of GSI infers: > The Lalbagh hill is composed of dark biolite gneiss of granitic to > granodioritic composition containing streaks of biolite. Vestiges of older > rocks are seen in the form of enclaves within the gneiss. Peninsular Gneiss > of the region is dated 2500 to 3400 million years that accreted in three > major episodes, i.e. 3.4 Ga, 3.3‚Äì3.2 Ga and 3.0‚Äì2.9 Ga. The quarries of > Lalbagh are of great importance for researches on earth sciences towards > evolution of the terrain. The Geological Survey of India has listed this site, one of the 26 such sites in the country, as \\"Geological Monuments of India\\" and has displayed a commemorative plaque in front of the rock tower which states: > Geological Survey of India: National Geological Monument: This monument is > over a typical exposure of peninsular gneiss, a geological term for complex > mixture of granitic rocks extensively developed in peninsular India. The > term was coined by Dr. W.F. Smeeth of Mysore Geological Department in 1916. > The peninsular gneiss is among the oldest rocks of the earth dating back to > 10 years old.

The park  A view of the Bugle Rock garden Amidst the natural rock formations, a small park with waterfalls and fountains has been developed as one of the green lungs of the garden city of Bangalore, which is frequented visited by children, families and the elderly. The park houses three temples. The densely tree-lined park developed by the Horticulture Department of the Government of Karnataka is considered a \\"walkers paradise\\" since over 750 to 1000 visitors (70% of them senior citizens) visit the park every day. One can also hear calls of a number of bats perched on the trees. An amphitheatre, which can accommodate 300 people, has been developed in the precincts of the park. The Hindu temple Dodda Basavana Gudi or Bull Temple, said to be the biggest temple to Nandi (the bull referred to as a sacred Hindu demi-god) in the world, and a Ganesha temple are in the limits of the park. According to an inscription in the Bull Temple, a spring beneath the Nandi is the source of the Vrishabhavathi River, which flows to the west of Bangalore. During the Third Mysore War, a contingent of the Mysore army, regrouped in this rock area under the leadership of Mir Khammar-ud-din before attacking the British Army. Honour to distinguished people Statue of D V Gundappa at Bugle Rock Gardens. Kempe Gowda founder of Bengaluru city and Bharat Ratna Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvarayya are seen behind on the Murals of the old tank wall The outer wall of an old water tank in the confines of the Bugle Rock park has murals of famous people of Bangalore and Karnataka: Kempe Gowda I (1513‚Äì1569), the ruler of Bangalore and Bharat Ratna Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvarayya (1860‚Äì1962), the engineer statesman and the builder of modern Karnataka, behind the statue of D V Gundappa, (1887‚Äì1975) popularly known as DVG, the Kannada litterateur, philosopher erected in 2002‚Äì03 to honour him. It is said that Bugle Rock was the place where D.V. Gundappa used to meet Masti Venkatesh Iyengar, journalist P.R. Ramaiya (of Tainadu newspaper fame, one of the founders of Kannada journalism and the first MLA from the area after independence), artist A.N. Subbarao (founder of Kalamandira which used to be in Gandhi Bazar), lawyers M.P. Somashekhara Rao and Nittoor Srinivasa Rau (who later became the Chief Justice of Karnataka High Court) and several other noted people like Prof. V.T. Srinivasan, founder and principal of Vijaya College, Bangalore. The park has been named in honour of T.R. Shamanna, a humanitarian and local politician. It has been spruced up with landscaping with rocky steps. An impressive entrance has been sculpted with rock pillars and by adding murals on the unused outer wall of the water tank with engravings of the faces of eminent people. Fruit bats Indian Flying-fox (Pteropus giganteus) feeding on Kapok (Ceiba pentandra) In the Bugle Rock park, in a study carried out by bat biologists, fruit bats (Pteropus giganteus) (also called Indian Flying-fox, listed as least-threatened in the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species Chiroptera Specialist Group 1996) have been recorded in roost trees (Ficus sp., Mangifera indica (mango fruit tree), Samanea saman (rain tree), Eucalyptus sp., Glaycindia sp.), and also in Gulmohar (Delonix regia) and jackfruit tree (Artocarpus heterophyllus) in the garden, tree groups and protected areas with a roost size of 650‚Äì710. The roost trees, about 20‚Äì25 and generally tall, are in the central area of the park and are 50‚Äì60 years old. The area is maintained by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA). The farmland, before roost, is stated to be undisturbed and ancient. The study has observed that there is need to conserve urban roosts of bats. It is recorded that the Police Commissionerate on Infantry Road, Bangalore has geared to preserve bats, which have nested in the trees in the Commiserate for many years.

It is a department of the Government of Sweden. It is one of the oldest governmental agencies in Sweden, as it was founded in 1636. It is also Sweden's de facto border guard. History Customs duties have existed in Sweden since the twelfth century, and the current organisation was created in 1636. During this period, the Swedish administration was being developed as Sweden was then a great power. The first Collector-General or Head of Customs was . Customs duties, known as \\"fiscal tolls\\", were first introduced to raise revenue for the state. Other tolls were introduced later to protect Swedish industry, so- called \\"protective tariffs\\". In earlier times, most goods were transported by sea. Vessels arriving in Sweden had to pass through the \\"Great Sea Toll\\" where customs duties were paid. There was also a domestic toll, known as the \\"Little Toll\\". In the case of the Little Toll, Swedes were forced to pay duty on goods they brought into towns to sell, an important source of income for the Swedish monarchy. In line with the arrival of duties, so came the rise of smuggling. Different goods have been smuggled at different times. From the 18th Century to the mid 19th Century, it was common to smuggle cloth. This was because the government was keen to encourage a textiles industry in Sweden and introduced customs duties and an import ban to prevent foreign cloth coming into the country. In the period between the two world wars, 1920-1939, alcohol was the item most smuggled. From the 1960s drug smuggling started to become a problem in Sweden, and remains one today. Another clear trend is the growing trade with other countries with the aid of new technology, such as the internet. Goods ordered from countries outside the EU through the internet are also subject to duty and other charges. Upon joining the European Union in 1995, Sweden also joined the EU customs union, which means the customs regulations are standardised throughout the EU. The joint customs union is slightly different from that of the Schengen Area covering free-travel. Current role Approximately 75 million travellers, ships, containers and vehicles cross Sweden's frontiers every year. Swedish Customs works in the midst of this flow of goods and people. The work of Swedish Customs within the law enforcement field extends across the entire chain of a criminal investigation, from intelligence and checks at the customs channel to a completed preliminary investigation. Border protection officers, customs investigators and customs prosecutors work together to combat criminal activity. Customs officers have the right to stop and search individuals, interview, investigate and to search premises. Customs officers can also be trained to be a Search Dog handler. When the dog retires, at about 10 years of age, the customs officer is offered the dog as a gift, and then can continue, either as a dog handler with another dog, a dog handling instructor, or a regular customs officer.

Background Squirtle Squirt was out of the mare Lost The Code, by multiple Grade I winner Lost Code. His sire was 1991 Hollywood Gold Cup winner Marquetry, who also sired the 1999 Breeders' Cup Sprint winner, Artax. Marquetry was a son of 1982 American Horse of the Year and Belmont Stakes winner Conquistador Cielo. Consigned to the 1998 Keeneland November sale, Squirtle Squirt was sold to Donna Wormser for $30,000. She put him up for auction again at the March 2000 Barretts Auction of 2-year-olds-in-training, where David Lanzman paid $25,000 for the colt with a bad knee. Lanzman turned him over to trainer Jose Garcia, Jr. for race conditioning. Racing career In his two-year-old season, Squirtle Squirt won five of his eight starts, including the Grade III Hollywood Juvenile Championship Stakes in July. In November, he underwent surgery for a persistent knee problem, after which his new owner sent him to trainer Bobby Frankel. In 2001, Squirtle Squirt raced exclusively in sprint races, winning three of his six starts and finishing a close second in the others. Sent east to the Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York, on August 25 the colt won the Grade I King's Bishop Stakes. He then finished second in the Vosburgh Stakes at Belmont Park, where he remained for that year's Breeders' Cup. Entered in the six-furlong Breeders' Cup Sprint, Squirtle Squirt defeated a strong field that included horses such as Xtra Heat (2nd), Caller One (3rd), and the 7:2 betting favorite, Kona Gold. For Frankel, it marked his first win in a Breeders' Cup race after thirty- eight starters. For his 2001 performances, Squirtle Squirt was voted the Eclipse Award as the American Champion Sprint Horse. At age four, Squirtle Squirt won two of four starts, with his best graded stakes result a second- place finish in the G2 Palos Verdes Handicap.

The place dates back to 1135 when it was known as Santflit, meaning \\"a navigable passage through sand\\". In 1622 the Spaniard Ambrogio Spinola constructed a fortification with seven bastions around Zandvliet, to strengthen the defenses of Antwerp against the northern Netherlands. The project lasted six years and gave the town the appearance of a citadel. At the beginning of the 18th century France drove Spain from Zandvliet after which the fortress became derelict. Traces of the original fortress can be seen in the street layout of Conterscherp, Zuidvest and Begijnhoeve. The church in Zandvliet was destroyed during the wars against Spain, but was rebuilt in 1648 by the bishop of Saint Michael's Abbey in Antwerp. After Belgium gained its independence in 1830, J. Bril became the first Belgian mayor of Zandvliet. In 1887 a rail link between Antwerp and Bergen op Zoom also linked to Zandvliet. This line mainly transported sugar beet, but also catered for passengers. In 1958 Berendrecht, Zandvliet and Lillo were incorporated in Antwerp and the polder landscape largely expropriated for harbour development. Since the decentralisation of 2000 these three old communities were joined under the name of Bezali, an acronym used by the media. The people of Berendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo on the other hand were proud of the original names and used them in the hope that they would not be forgotten. The name Zandvliet became a household name, thanks to the 1967 naming of Zandvlietsluis, one of the largest sea locks in the world.

The first London performance was on 18 January 1936 at the Phoenix Theatre.The Times 19 January 1936, p. 15. Coward directed all ten pieces, and each starred Coward and Gertrude Lawrence. Coward said that he wrote them as \\"acting, singing, and dancing vehicles for Gertrude Lawrence and myself\\".Coward, unnumbered introductory page The plays were performed in various combinations of three at each performance during the original run. The plays chosen for each performance were announced in advance, although a myth evolved that the groupings were random.The Times, 20 January 1936, p. 10; 11 February 1936, p. 12; 2 March 1936, p. 12; 6 April 1936, p. 10; 2 May 1936, p. 12; 10 June 1936, p. 14. Matin√©es were sometimes billed as Today at 2:30. The title of the play refers to a wood finishing process that treats the oak with ammonia fumes to darken it and emphasise its rough grain; the finish is dull rather than glossy.\\"Oak Finishes\\", at The Victor-Victrola Page, accessed 26 October 2009 The Observer commented in its review, \\"Mr Coward, as a pale and hairy specimen of suburban revolt throws his supper to the floor and behaves more like Petruchio and looks more like an advertisement for liver pills ... than one could possibly imagine ... he is considerably assisted by Miss Gertrude Lawrence and Miss Alison Leggatt as dowdy shrew and shrew's mama. Miss Moya Nugent, as the dreadful daughter, bravely mutilates her appearance in order to look every inch the adenoid.\\"The Observer 19 January 1936, p. 15 The Broadway openings for the three parts took place on 24 November 1936, 27 November 1936 (including Fumed Oak) and 30 November 1936 at the National Theatre, again starring Coward and Lawrence. Star Chamber was not included.Fumed Oak and other plays at the IBDB database The London and New York runs were limited only by Coward's boredom at long engagements.Kenrick, John. \\"Noel Coward 101: Coward's Musicals\\", Musicals 101: The Cyber Encyclopedia of Musical Theatre, TV and Film Major productions of parts of the cycle were revived in 1948 and 1967 on Broadway (including Fumed Oak in 1948 but not in 1967), in 1981 at the Lyric Theatre in London (omitting Fumed Oak) and at the Chichester Festival in 2006 (Shadow Play, Hands Across the Sea, Red Peppers, Family Album, Fumed Oak and The Astonished Heart). In 1971, the Shaw Festival revived three of the plays, and in 2000, the Williamstown Theatre Festival revived six of the plays, but neither revival included Fumed Oak.Brantley, Ben. \\"How to Savor Fleeting Joys: Smiles Suave, Brows Arched\\", The New York Times, 28 June 2000, However, the Antaeus Company in Los Angeles revived all ten plays in October 2007, and the Shaw Festival did so in 2009.\\"No√´l Coward's Tonight at 8:30 series started with previews of Brief Encounters at the Shaw Festival Theatre\\", Shaw Festival Theatre '09 For a 1952 film Meet Me Tonight, directed by Anthony Pelissier, Coward adapted Ways and Means, Red Peppers and Fumed Oak (called Tonight at 8:30 in the US)Meet Me Tonight (1952) at the IMDB database In 1991, BBC television mounted productions of the individual plays with Joan Collins taking the Lawrence roles.Truss, Lynne. \\"Tonight at 8.30\\", The Times, 15 April 1991 The sheer expense involved in mounting what are effectively ten different productions has usually deterred revivals of the entire Tonight at 8.30 cycle, but the constituent plays can often be seen individually or in sets of three. Roles and original cast *Henry Gow ‚Äì No√´l Coward *Doris (his wife) ‚Äì Gertrude Lawrence *Elsie (his daughter) ‚Äì Moya Nugent *Mrs Rockett (his mother-in-law) ‚Äì Alison Leggatt (Joyce Carey in New York) Plot It is breakfast time in the home of Henry Gow, a downtrodden, middle-aged salesman. He eats silently while the three women in his life exchange unpleasantries. His sloppy wife, Doris, and \\"horrible adenoidal daughter\\", Elsie, argue about her putting her hair up. Doris and his nagging mother-in-law, Mrs Rockett, quarrel about physical complaints, and Doris suggests that her mother move in with another relative. Elsie leaves for school, and her grandmother gives her money despite her mother's objections. Henry leaves the room, and the two women interrupt their argument to focus on him. They prepare to attack Henry, but when he reenters, dressed for work, they become sidetracked, and he departs, as the two continue quarrelling. Later, at 7.30 that evening, Henry comes home (after a few drinks at a pub) unusually voluble. The women are leaving for the cinema, but Doris henpecks Henry on her way out. He demands that they sit, exclaiming, \\"What right have you got to nag at me and boss me? No right at all. I'm the one that pays the rent and works for you and keeps you. What do you give me in return, I'd like to know! Nothing! I sit through breakfast while you and mother wrangle. You're too busy being snarly and bad-tempered even to say good morning. I come home tired after working all day and ten to one there isn't even a hot dinner for me.\\" He explains that he has been putting money aside, and he is leaving. He has transferred the freehold of the house to Doris and recommends that she make money by taking in lodgers (\\"though God help the poor bastards if you do\\"). With a final critique of each of the three women, he leaves them for good (taking his savings with him), saying: \\"Good-bye one and all! Nice to have known you.\\" He happily slams the door behind him as they wail. NotesReferences *Castle, Charles. No√´l, W. H. Allen, London, 1972. *Coward, No√´l.

Overview Seƒçovlje is the last Slovenian settlement before the Slovenia‚ÄìCroatia border on the highway south from Portoro≈æ.Piran municipal site Its main source of income is tourism at Seƒçovlje Saltpans Natural Park. The section of the Parenzana railway path that runs through Seƒçovlje is now a recreational path for tourists. Nearby is the Portoro≈æ Airport, which offers panoramic flights over Slovenian Istria. The Seƒçovlje international border crossing is one of the main crossings from Slovenia into Croatian Istria. History postcard of Seƒçovlje (1903) Archaeological finds and text sources point to a settlement in the area of Seƒçovlje that dates back to the Roman times, the nearby salt pans in the 12th century. Modernisation of the salt pans occurred in the 14th century, and salt production drastically increased in the times of Austria-Hungary, when the mines expanded to an area of 508 hectares and were from the 24 April (St George) to 24 August (St Bartholomew) the source of income for about 500 families.

It performs flight testing on C-130 Hercules, CV-22 Osprey, MH-53 Pave Low, UH-1 Iroquois, and HH-60 Pave Hawk aircraft. The first predecessor of the squadron was first activated during World War II as the 413th Bombardment Squadron. It served in the European Theater of Operations, where it earned two Distinguished Unit Citations for its combat actions. Following V-E Day, the squadron returned to the United States and was inactivated. This squadron was again active from 1947 to 1949 in the reserves, although it was apparently never fully manned or equipped. It was active as a Boeing B-47 Stratojet squadron in Strategic Air Command from 1958 to 1962. The second predecessor of the squadron, the 6513th Test Squadron was activated in 1977 at Edwards Air Force Base, California. In 1992, the two squadrons were consolidated as the 413th Test Squadron. The squadron was inactivated in 2004, but reactivated the following year at Hurlburt Field, Florida. Overview The squadron planned, provided for, and conducted tests of electronic warfare and avionics systems and equipment, on aircraft assigned to the Air Force Flight Test Center between 1977 and 2004. It has planned, executed and managed Development and Qualification Test and Evaluation of fixed-wing aircraft assigned to Air Force Special Operations Command and of all Air Force helicopters since 2005. HistoryWorld War II= Initially established as a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress reconnaissance squadron in early 1942, redesignated as a heavy bombardment squadron and activated in July. Trained under II Bomber Command in the northwestern United States, then moved to Texas for better flying weather in early 1943. Deployed to England and assigned to VIII Bomber Command. Lockheed/Vega B-17G-20-VE Fortress of the 413th Bomb Squadron. AAF Serial No. 42-97627 is in foreground Flew first combat mission over Occupied Europe on 14 May 1943, Participated in the famous Regensburg shuttle mission to North Africa. Took part in the Big Week Schweinfurt mission of 14 October 1943. In addition, the squadron attacked shipyards, harbours, railway yards, aerodromes, oil refineries, aircraft factories, and other industrial targets in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia.Freeman Participated in very long-range mission through heavy clouds and intense anti-aircraft fire to raid important aircraft component factories in Poland on 9 April 1944. Other significant targets included airfields at Bordeaux and Augsburg; marshalling yards at Kiel, Hamm, Brunswick, and Gdynia; aircraft factories at Chemnitz, Hanover, and Di√≥sgy≈ër; oil refineries at Merseburg and Br√ºx, and chemical works in Wiesbaden, Ludwigshafen, and Neunkirchen In addition to strategic operations, missions included bombing coastal defences, railway bridges, gun emplacements, and field batteries in the battle area prior to and during the invasion of Normandy in June 1944; attacking enemy positions in support of the breakthrough at Saint-L√¥ in July 1944; aiding the campaign in France in August by striking roads and road junctions, and by dropping supplies to the Maquis; and attacking, during the early months of 1945, the communications supplying German armies on the western front. After V-E Day, flew food missions to the Netherlands and hauled redeployed personnel to French Morocco, Ireland, France, and Germany. In November 1945 its aircraft were flown back to the United States, and was inactivated on 19 December 1945. =Reserves= Was reactivated as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress reserve squadron in 1947 at Keesler Field (later Air Force Base), Mississippi. Unit may or may not have been equipped with aircraft, possibly was an administrative unit with no personnel assigned. Was inactivated on 27 June 1949Ravenstein, due to budget reductions. =Strategic Air Command= From 1958, the Boeing B-47 Stratojet wings of Strategic Air Command (SAC) began to assume an alert posture at their home bases, reducing the amount of time spent on alert at overseas bases. The SAC alert cycle divided itself into four parts: planning, flying, alert and rest to meet General Thomas S. Power's initial goal of maintaining one third of SAC‚Äôs planes on fifteen minute ground alert, fully fueled and ready for combat to reduce vulnerability to a Soviet missile strike.Schake, p. 220 (note 43) To implement this new system B-47 wings reorganized from three to four squadrons.Schake, p. 220 (note 43) The 413th was activated at Dyess Air Force Base as the fourth squadron of the 96th Bombardment Wing. The alert commitment was increased to half the squadron's aircraft in 1962 and the four squadron pattern no longer met the alert cycle commitment, so the squadron was inactivated on 1 January 1962. =Flight testing= The 6513th Flight Test Squadron (known as the \\"Red Hats\\") was activated at Edwards Air Force Base, California on 1 December 1977 as part of the USAF Flight Test Center. The squadron was assigned to Edwards, although it operated from Tonopah Test Range Airport, Nevada to perform technical evaluations of acquired Soviet Aircraft. A similar organization, the 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron (\\"Red Eagles\\") performed clandestine flight testing of the aircraft. In October 1992 at the end of the Cold War, the squadrons were inactivated with the 6513th being consolidated with the 413th Test Squadron which was reactivated. The Red Hats, however, possibly continued to conduct FME projects, apparently as an unnumbered squadron at an undisclosed location in Nevada.Red Hats 6513th Flight Test SquadronDavies, p. 352 The 413th performed flight testing of electronic warfare assets at Edwards. Inactivated in March 2004 as part of a consolidation and realignment of EW assets, remaining personnel and assets were transferred to Electronic Warfare Directorate North Base. Reactivated at Hurlburt Field, Florida in February 2005, providing flight testing of special operations aircraft and helicopters under the 46th Test Wing. Moved to Duke Field in 2012 due to budget reductions.Rogers, Lineage ; 413th Bombardment Squadron * Constituted as the 23d Reconnaissance Squadron (Heavy) on 28 January 1942 : Redesignated 413th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 22 April 1942 : Activated on 15 July 1942 : Redesignated 413th Bombardment Squadron, Heavy on 20 August 1943 : Inactivated on 19 December 1945 * Redesignated 413th Bombardment Squadron, Very Heavy on 3 July 1947 : Activated in the reserve on 17 July 1947 : Inactivated on 27 June 1949 * Redesignated 413th Bombardment Squadron, Medium on 20 August 1958 : Activated on 1 November 1958 : Discontinued and inactivated, on 1 January 1962 * Consolidated with the 6513th Test Squadron as the 6513th Test Squadron on 1 October 1992 ; 413th Flight Test Squadron * Designated as the 6513th Test Squadron and activated on 1 December 1977 : Consolidated with the 413th Bombardment Squadron on 1 October 1992 : Redesignated 413th Test Squadron on 2 October 1992 : Redesignated 413th Flight Test Squadron on 1 March 1994 : Inactivated on 6 May 2004 * Activated on 25 February 2005 =Assignments= * 96th Bombardment Group, 15 July 1942 ‚Äì 19 December 1945 * 96th Bombardment Group, 17 July 1947 ‚Äì 27 June 1949 * 96th Bombardment Wing, 1 November 1958 ‚Äì 1 January 1962 * Air Force Flight Test Center, 1 December 1977 * 6510th Test Wing (later 412th Test Wing), 1 March 1978 * 412th Operations Group, 1 October 1993 ‚Äì 6 May 2004 * 46th Operations Group, 25 February 2005 ‚Äì 18 July 2012 * 96th Operations Group, 18 July 2012 ‚Äì present =Stations= * Salt Lake City Army Air Base, Utah, 15 July 1942 * Gowen Field, Idaho, 6 August 1942 * Walla Walla Army Air Base, Washington, 16 August 1942 * Rapid City Army Air Base, South Dakota, 29 September 1942 * Pocatello Army Airfield, Idaho, 1 November 1942 * Pyote Army Air Base, Texas, 3 January‚Äì16 April 1943 * RAF Great Saling (AAF-485),Station number in Anderson.
