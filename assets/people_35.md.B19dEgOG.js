The township was named after Edward Cornwallis, the founder of Halifax, Nova Scotia. It bordered Aylesford Township to the west and Horton Township to the south. While the name has fallen into disuse on maps, overshadowed by the growth of individual towns and villages within the township, many historical places and documents refer to Cornwallis. The Parish of Cornwallis, however, is still in use today by several churches after more than 250 years. History After the French colonists, the Acadians were commanded to leave Nova Scotia in the Great Expulsion, the area was relatively desolate. The Township was established by a group historians refer to as the New England Planters. In the early 1760s the Planters brought with them the colonial pattern of land division; each town or township was to contain one hundred thousand acres. While an official town plot was laid out for Cornwallis Township in what is now Starr's Point, towns actually took shape around Planter settlements at Port Williams, Kentville, Kingsport and Canning. A generation after the Planters, a sudden influx of United Empire Loyalist settlers arrived to escape the Revolutionary War in New England further changing township settlements.

At his school age, there were no schools in the whole of Uyo division, and it was difficult to establish any, because of strong opposition by Ibibio people, in and around Uyo. Prior to his birth, his father Chief Nsentip Ekown had signed a treaty with the British Consul ‚Äì Sir Robert Brooks which established Uyo as a British Colonial Administrative station. Chief Nsentip Ekown was a Paramount Ruler amongst his people. He was thus confirmed, honoured, with this title, and crowned as the first Warrant Paramount Ruler of the area through the Consul by King Edward VII in 1902. Chief Nsentip Ekown, in conjunction with Chief Udo-Ekong Umana Ekam of Abak, led the British to establish the Government School at Abak. As a Warrant Ruler, Chief Nsentip Ekown played a prominent role by assisting the British to subdue Essien Inyang Ide of Abak whose parcel of land the school was established. It would be quite unsafe for anybody linked with the name Nsentip to attend the school; hence Ukpong Nsentip Ekown had to adopt the name Elijah Akpan Okon to acquire education at the Abak Government School. This was also an era, which the early missionaries and the colonial teachers in Nigeria preferred to, and renamed the Nigerian students with biblical and European names other than African. In 1940, Chief Elijah Akpan Okon studied Rural Science Education, and community development at Umuahia. He also had a Graduation Certificate in Agriculture and Home Economics in 1947, through the Pennsylvania State College, USA. In 1952 he obtained a Diploma in Business Management and company Secretarial studies from a school in London. After completing his Primary school education in 1929, he took a job as a teacher in a local school, primarily to have the opportunity of encouraging the people to send their children to school. From 1937‚Äì1950, he was a teacher, and Head Master at Ukana Methodist School in Ikot Ekpene. Between 1942 and 1949 Chief Elijah Akpan Okon was the secretary, Nigerian Union of Teachers (N.U.T.) Ikot Ekpene Branch. His passion as a community leader and organizer showed up early in his life. Around 1933‚Äì1939, Chief Elijah Akpan Okon founded Ikono Young-men Meeting whose aim was to raise funds and sponsor the youths of that era to have secondary education from the few colleges such as Government College, Umuahia; Etinan Institute, Methodist Boys' High School, Oron and Uzuakoli etc. Several youths of Ikono availed themselves of that opportunity. In 1950, he returned from Ukana, Ikot Ekpene to his village Ikot Mbon Ikono, Uyo. He was appointed a rural science teacher in the Uyo Federated schools (1951‚Äì1955). He left that post, and brought up his village school Ikono Central School (now the AME Zion Mission School ) where he was a teacher and the Head Master from (1956‚Äì1960). Within 1949, he had attempted, in vain, to form the Ikono Federation but in the process Northern Ikono Federation emerged in 1950. During his tenure as the founder and first President of the Northern Ikono Federation, a community Centre was built which housed a meeting hall, a library, a postal agency, etc. Arrangements were made for the local people to learn weaving, and pottery at the center. At its entirety, the aim of the federation was to raise funds and give scholarships for the local youths to attain higher education. Sir Clement Pleass, K.C.M.G; K.B.E. the British Governor of Eastern Nigeria was invited and he did the inaugural opening of the center on June 29, 1955 . Chief Elijah Akpan Okon was given a Certificate of Faithful Service to the people of Uyo, by the Governor. Chief Elijah Akpan Okon used his political influence and affiliations to establish; and promoted the Primary Education (U P E) programme in Uyo, and the whole of Calabar Province. He set up oil palm seedling nurseries in schools and some communities. He encouraged the local farmers to participate in oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) cultivation which was a major foreign exchange earner for Nigeria. He ensured that certain farm equipment and fertilizer were distributed free to the local farmers. These exercises were in part, programmes of the NCNC led government of Eastern Nigeria which he intended the local farmers to benefit. From 1959‚Äì1961, he became the Chairman of Uyo Federated County Council. He came up with the first master plan for Uyo. It was at this time that the old stadium, the Uyo Motor Park, the streets were established, and named. Pipe borne water and electricity were introduced. He made sure that dispensaries/clinics and maternities were built and operated in the rural areas of Uyo Division. Postal agencies were available for people in the local areas. Within this time he excised the Uyo Council into two distinct and separate administrative entities, Uyo Urban; and Uyo Federated County Councils with headquarters at Uyo and Ikot Ebio, Offot respectively. The aim in this was to allow development to expand into the rural areas. He awarded scholarships to qualified and deserving students to colleges and universities. His efforts in all these had yielded a multiplier effect in terms of human power and resource development to the community. Uyo Division now has numerous indigenous and enviable personnel in almost every field of human endeavours. Chief Elijah Akpan Okon was a Nationalist. His Political Party, National Council of Nigerian Citizens(NCNC), produced Chief (Dr.) Nnamdi Azikiwe as the first indigenous President of Nigeria, who took over the realms of political powers peacefully, from the British Colonial rule, and ushered in a parliamentary democratic system of government. From thence, Nigeria became an independent and a sovereign nation on October 1, 1960. Chief Elijah Akpan Okon held a strong belief and advocated that Ibibio people should participate, and play the politics of the government at the centre and to stay within that centre and struggle for their rights, and amenities. This was his main differential point between his political opponents, who stayed or crossed the carpet, from the National Council of Nigerian Citizens (NCNC) to the Action Group (AG) and derived no benefits from that opposing party. Chief Elijah Akpan Okon was a devout Christian and a Director of Christian education in AME Zion church Nigeria Conference. He was instrumental in establishing the AME Zion mission co-educational Teachers Training College at Ndon Ebom near Uyo. In 1964 he hosted the AME Zion conference at Ikot Mbon Ikono, Uyo. The Presiding Bishop at this conference was Bishop Alfred G. Dunston an African American prelate in charge of the West African Episcopal District of AME Zion mission. In that conference Chief Elijah Akpan Okon along with others succeeded for the church to sponsor four Nigerians to study in the United States of America. This was a prelude to have Nigerian indigenes in the administration of the church. As a result of that initiative, and amongst the four emerged on August 5, 1988 Dr. Samuel Chuka Ekemam, SR, who was consecrated, a BISHOP, and now presides over the affairs of the AME Zion Church in Nigeria Episcopal District and remains the most senior Prelate in AME Zion Church Connection worldwide. The crisis in Nigeria reached its climax in 1966. Party politics and the Nigerian Constitution were suspended by the Military take over of the country. Since he was the chairman of his party (NCNC) for Uyo, he handed all the political papers, other documents, etc. to the Divisional Police officer in Uyo in 1966. He thus lost interest in active politics. He decided to pay more attention to his new role as the General Manager of the AME Zion schools in Nigeria, a post he held from 1962‚Äì1968. In 1966 and 1967, the Military Governor of Eastern Nigeria, Lt.Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu appointed him a member of the Eastern Nigeria Consultative Assembly at Enugu as well as a member of the Provincial Executive Committee of Uyo and later on elected as the Sole Administrator for Uyo. He had no choice but to accept, these positions, much against his will. These were the official posts he held, until his mishap. During the Nigerian Civil War, Chief Elijah Akpan Okon conducted several town hall meetings in a relentless effort to educate the populace on the best ways to comport themselves by words and by deeds to ward off any confrontation by the Biafran soldiers who were under orders to arrest or kill any saboteur. A lot of people had for safety abandoned big cities for their villages. Chief Elijah Akpan Okon utilized this excess manpower in opening up, and widening their different community roads, which are still being used today. He encouraged the people to show interest in improving their community. Common salt was scarce at this time, and chief Elijah Akpan Okon distributed this essential commodity, free of charge to people. Somewhere, around January 1968, the Nigerian army had captured Uyo; and the prevailing latent undertone of anarchy gave rise to angry uprising, thuggery, and looting. Significant and irreversible episodes had reached a perilous magnitude, and surpassed a point of no return. Within that community thugs, and angry mop moved in, disdaining any obstruction on their path, until they reached, and carried out the object of their mission being utter looting, and burning to ashes the spacious and well accommodating GOODWILL LODGE compounds of Chief Elijah Akpan Okon, and other relations. They moved on, vandalized, and looted all they could take away from the Northern Ikono Community Center Building. Okuku Tom Akpan Okon alias Udom Nsentip, a senior brother to Chief Elijah Akpan Okon; and others were detained by the Nigerian army. These excessive, oppressive and distressing news prompted Chief Elijah Akpan Okon to turn himself over to the Nigerian soldiers, mainly, in an effort to rescue and gain freedom to those detainees. Chief Elijah Akpan Okon was courageous throughout the ordeal. He sent a letter to the Nigerian Army commanding officer Uyo specifically stating that he was waiting for them at Northern Ikono Federation center premises. Chief Elijah Akpan Okon was taken to Uyo where he was detained, molested, and eventfully executed, publicly by firing squad, perpetuated by his political opponents, without questions or any form of trial on May 27, 1968 under the orders of Commander Benjamin Adekunle, the Commanding Officer of the Nigerian Army for Uyo. His remains were covered up in a shallow dug up pit, a spot, which now is the present site of magnificent Ibom Connection in Uyo.

Life After finishing primary school and classical gymnasium in Zagreb, he enrolled the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Zagreb where he graduated in 1972 in theoretical linguistics, Latin, Ancient Greek and their literatures. He received his MA in archeology in 1974 with the thesis Greek language of the monuments of Late Antique Salona, and in 1976 his PhD with the theoretical-linguistics thesis titled Linguistics and dialectics. Since 1972, he worked as a professor of Latin and Ancient Greek in a primary school, and from 1974 on at the Classical Gymnasium in Zagreb. In 1977 he received a full- time job, first as a teacher assistant, then as a docent (since 1977), and finally as a regular professor in 1986, re-elected in 1992, at the Department of General linguistics at the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb. During that period, he served as the head of the department, and soon after their foundation, the head of departments of applied linguistics and semiotics. In one turn he served both as the head of the department and a prodean for teaching. In the period of 1996‚Äì2003 he served as a professor of linguistics and semiotics at the Institutum Studiorum Humanitatis, the faculty of post- graduate humanities studies at the University of Ljubljana, where he wrote a post-graduate and doctoral study regarding the speech linguistics and the theory of societal communication, serving as the coordinator of the study. Soon after he returned to his duty of a regular professor of the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb.

The community is located on Farm to Market Road 31, about east of Carthage. Deadwood, previously known as Linus, is on Farm Road 2517 some 10 miles east of Carthage in eastern Panola County. The area was first settled in 1837 by Adam LaGrone and his family, who built a homestead not far from Socogee Creek, after they were granted around 10,000 acres from the Mexican government. Deadwood was the first community east of the Sabine River in Panola County. Men of the LaGrone family fought in the Texas Revolution, the Regulator-Moderator War, and the Civil War. After the end of the Civil War, a grandson of Adam, Confederate veteran Hiram Clark LaGrone built a mill and gin that became the nucleus of the later town. The LaGrone family still owns much of the original land grant and encompasses most of the membership of Deadwood's two churches‚Äîthe Deadwood Methodist Church and the Deadwood Pentecostal Church.https://www.panolacrossroads.com/index.php/magazine- articles/2014-magazines/august-2014/261-deadwood The Rev. Charlie and Clara Alexander LaGrone Family Community Center adjoins the Deadwood Methodist Church. Locally, two LaGrone men, direct descendants of Deadwood's founder, sit on the Commissioners' Court of Panola County. The small settlement was originally known as Linus, but when residents applied for a post office in 1882, another town already had that name, and the new name Deadwood was chosen at a town meeting. A family burial ground was begun on the LaGrone farm in 1847 when Adam LaGrone's wife, Christeena, died. Adam was buried next to his wife nine years later. Although the land did not officially appear in county deed records as a public cemetery until 1859, members of the community were buried here before that time. A testament to early Panola county history, the Deadwood cemetery is still in use and maintained by descendants of pioneer families. By 1885 Deadwood had an estimated population of 50, two churches, a district school, and a steam cotton gin and gristmill. A hotel was built there around 1900, but went out of business a few years later; the local post office was discontinued in 1917. In the mid-1930s, Deadwood had a church, a school, and two stores; its reported population in 1936 was 125. After World War II, the community's school was consolidated with the Carthage district, and the remaining businesses at Deadwood closed. In 1990, Deadwood was a dispersed rural community with a reported population of 106. The population remained unchanged in 2000. Deadwood Cemetery was created when Christeena LaGrone was buried there in 1847. She and her husband were the first Anglos to live west of the Sabine River in Panola County, Texas. In House of 1000 Corpses, the fictional town of Ruggsville is located near Deadwood.

It is bordered by Olneyville to the south, Valley to the east, Manton to the west, and Elmhurst to the northeast, and the Town of North Providence to the north. The major street boundaries that define Mount Pleasant are Academy Avenue to the east, Smith Street to the northeast, Atwells Avenue to the south, and portions of Bullock, Chalkstone, Mera, and Rushmore Avenues to the west. Mount Pleasant is one of Providence's most stable neighborhoods. According to the 1990 census, less than half of all Mount Pleasant residents moved into their current residence in the past five years; nearly four out of ten residents had lived in their present unit for more than a decade, and almost one out of five had lived in his or her current home for more than 20 years.  History  Mount Pleasant Fire Station, on Mount Pleasant Avenue Mount Pleasant was one of the last sections of the city to be developed, and as a result, most of the houses are of medium size on well landscaped lots and tree-lined streets. Although some houses were constructed in the 19th century, most were built in the early 20th century. The majority of the land area in Mount Pleasant served as farm land through much of the 18th century. By the 1730s, two roads had been established to facilitate produce delivery from the outlying farms to the market downtown. The roads included the northern branch along present-day Douglas Avenue and Eaton Street, and the southern branch along Chalkstone Avenue. The area of Mount Pleasant remained sparsely populated until around the end of the 19th century. It wasn't until the 1880s when streetcars traversed Chalkstone Avenue that the neighborhood would see a significant number of houses constructed. In the early 1900s, a neighborhood commercial strip formed along Chalkstone Avenue between River Avenue and Mount Pleasant Avenue. That commercial strip remains a thriving part of the neighborhood today, including a full-service grocery store, a bank, service stations, pharmacies, bakeries, tailors, barber shops, meat markets, restaurants, and pubs.  Landmarks  Mount Pleasant High School Various large educational institutions such as Rhode Island College and Mount Pleasant High School are located in the neighborhood. Along with Triggs Memorial Golf Course, this institutional area is significant in that it provides the neighborhood with substantial open space.  Demographics  By the early 20th century, the Mount Pleasant area was predominantly middle and upper middle-class. The area gradually became more diverse after 1900, as second and third generation Irish-Americans began to move into the area to escape the more congested neighborhoods of Smith Hill and South Providence. By the mid 20th century, second and third-generation Italian-Americans comprised a significant portion of the neighborhood's ethnic composition, many of them having moved to Mount Pleasant from Federal Hill. The median family income in Mount Pleasant in 1989 was $36,073, 27 percent higher than the citywide median. The incidence of poverty in Mount Pleasant increased slightly in all categories over the past decade, although poverty rates remained well below the citywide figures. In 1990, less than 10 percent of all persons were poor, about 7 percent of families were living below poverty, 16 percent of children were poor, and about 12 percent of the elderly had income below the poverty level.

A single engined biplane intended to meet a requirement to replace the Sopwith Snipe, the Basilisk was unsuccessful, only three being built. Development and design In 1918, the British Air Ministry issued the RAF Type 1 specification for a single-seat fighter, powered by the new (and untried) ABC Dragonfly air cooled radial engine to replace the Sopwith Snipe. To meet this requirement, Frederick Koolhoven, (formerly of Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft and before that Deperdussin) chief designer of the British Aerial Transport Company of London, designed the F.K. 25 Basilisk.Lewis 1979, pp.128, 130. Like Koolhovens earlier F.K.23 Bantam, the Basilisk was a two-bay biplane with a wooden monocoque fuselage, but was larger and heavier to accommodate the larger engine and the equipment required by the Specification. Armament was two Vickers machine guns mounted ahead of the pilot, and enclosed in a large fairing that formed the upper coaming of the pilot's cockpit.Mason 1992, p.140.Bruce 1957, p.75. Three prototypes were ordered in early 1918, and the first one flew in September 1918. It was destroyed on 3 May 1919 when attempting to break the World altitude record, its engine catching fire and BAT's test pilot, Peter Legh, being killed after he jumped clear.Flight 8 May 1919, p.616. The second and third prototype were fitted with modified, horn balanced ailerons, with the second prototype tested at Martlesham Heath in October 1919. While its performance was good (although not as good as claimed by BAT), the Dragonfly engine was hopelessly unreliable, with further development or production abandoned earlier in the year, and the Basilisk was abandoned when Koolhoven left BAT at the end of 1919.

The wing, based at NAS Oceana, is also home to the east coast F/A-18 Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) which trains pilots and Weapon Systems Officers (WSOs) in the Hornet and Super Hornet before they are assigned to operational fleet squadrons. The fleet squadrons deploy as part of Carrier Air Wings (CVWs) on aircraft carriers on both the east and west coasts. History The wing was established in 1970 as Commander, Light Attack Wing One (CLAW ONE) at NAS Cecil Field, Florida. With the introduction of the F/A-18 in the late 1980s, the command was redesignated as SFWL on 1 September 1993Naval Aviation News May/June 1994 pg 6. As a result of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) decision to close NAS Cecil Field in 1999, the wing relocated to NAS Oceana, Virginia in 1998. In 2006, SFWL subsumed the staff of Commander, Fighter Wing Atlantic upon the retirement of the F-14 Tomcat and that wing's disestablishment. Mission Strike Fighter Wing's mission is to provide U.S. Atlantic Fleet commanders with combat-ready Strike Fighter squadrons which are fully trained, properly manned, well maintained and supported. The wing is responsible for the readiness, training, administration, and maintenance support of all Atlantic Fleet F/A-18A-F Hornet and Super Hornet squadrons. Although this basic responsibility extends throughout the deployment cycle of individual units, direct operational control of fleet squadrons is generally retained by Carrier Air Wing commanders, whether deployed or not. The Wing is also the lead advocate for issues, maintenance developments and operational readiness factors impacting the VFA community. Organization SFWL is commanded by a Navy captain, who is also known as the Wing \\"Commodore\\". The wing staff consists of approximately 50 officer, enlisted and civilian personnel. CSFWL reports directly to Commander, Naval Air Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet in Norfolk, Va. Assigned units Strike Fighter Wing Atlantic exercises administrative and operational command over one Fleet Replacement Squadron (VFA-106) and administrative command over 16 operational fleet F/A-18 squadrons. Each Strike Fighter squadron normally consists of 10-12 aircraft, 22 officers and approximately 190 enlisted personnel. **VFA-11 Red Rippers **VFA-15 Valions **VFA-31 Tomcatters **VFA-32 Swordsmen **VFA-34 Blue Blasters **VFA-37 Bulls **VFA-81 Sunliners **VFA-83 Rampagers **VFA-87 Golden Warriors **VFA-103 Jolly Rogers **VFA-105 Gunslingers **VFA-106 Gladiators [FRS] **VFA-131 Wildcats **VFA-136 Knighthawks **VFA-143 Pukin Dogs **VFA-211 Fighting Checkmates **VFA-213 Black Lions Additionally, CSFWL exercises command over Strike Fighter Weapons School Atlantic.

Coustos wrote a book detailing his sufferings under the Inquisition and pointed to 1728 as being the year of the first Lodge, although nothing is known of the first years of this Lodge and it was not then recognised by the Grand Lodge of England. Today there are several Masonic Obediences in Portugal. Grande Oriente Lusitano The \\"Grand Orient of Lusitania\\", founded in 1802, is the oldest Masonic Obedience in Portugal. It is recognized by the Grand Orient de France and also belongs to CLIPSAS. The Grand Orient of Portugal is part of the liberal or continental Freemasonry tradition, proclaiming the absolute liberty of conscience and dogmatism. =Rites= Under the auspices of the Grande Oriente Lusitano there are lodges of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite and of the French Rite. These Rites are administered by the respective philosophical Potences with which the Grande Oriente Lusitano has a treaty to confer the symbolic degrees: *The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite for Portugal and its jurisdiction Supreme Council of the Grand Inspector-General of the 33rd Degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite for Portugal and its jurisdiction *French Rite of Portugal (Rose-Croix)Sovereign Grand Chapter of the Cavaliers Rose-Croix - Grand Chapter General of the French Rite of Portugal =Gr√©mio Lusitano= The three potencies are represented in civil society through the Gr√©mio Lusitano, a cultural, recreational and philanthropic society whose headquarters are situated at the Rua do Gr√©mio Lusitano, number 25, in Lisbon. This building, the Masonic Palace, also hosts the Portuguese Masonic Museum, which is open to the general public. Grande Loja Regular de Portugal The \\"Regular Grand Lodge of Portugal\\" (GLRP) was established in 1991 by the Grande Loge Nationale Fran√ßaise (GLNF), in an attempt to introduce regular organised Freemasonry into Portugal. Following internal disagreement, the organisation split in 1996. The founding French authority has since withdrawn recognition, and the residual GLRP enjoys very little international recognition. Grande Loja Legal de Portugal/GLRP Following a dispute over the legality of an election to the Grand Mastership of GLRP, the party disputing the election took control of the civil association under which the Obedience had legal existence. In 1996 a large majority of the members of that body created a new civil association under the name \\"Grande Loja Legal de Portugal/Grande Loja Regular de Portugal\\" (GLLP/GLRP). The GLLP/GLRP considers itself to be entirely continuous with the Grand Lodge founded in 1991, and unconnected with the body which holds legal title to the original name, and which it considers to be a clandestine organization. This position is upheld by the regular Masonic world, which is acknowledged by the United Grand Lodge of England which prints the date \\"1991\\" in its annual Year Book after the entry for the GLLP/GLRP. Almost all Regular Masonic jurisdictions worldwide recognise the GLLP/GLRP as the only (native) regular masonic authority in Portugal. These include the three Home Grand Lodges, which are the three original and oldest Grand Lodges in Freemasonry, the United Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Ireland, and the Grand Lodge of Scotland. As the rather cumbersome legal name exists chiefly for legal reasons, the Grand Lodge is often known in English as simply \\"The (Legal) Regular Grand Lodge of Portugal\\". This is the name used by the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and by the United Grand Lodge of England, although it is further shortened to just \\"Grand Lodge of Portugal (Legal)\\" on the UGLE website. United Grand Lodge of England On 17 April 1735 Lord Weymouth, Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of England received a petition from Brethren residing in Lisbon. This was granted and a Provincial Grand Lodge was created. The United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) is in amity with the GLLP/GLRP, which it recognises as fully regular. However, owing to the sizeable British ex-patriate community in Portugal, there are also several UGLE lodges warranted and operating in the country. These use English rituals, and work in the English language. They are controlled directly from London, and the UGLE appoints a local Grand Inspector for day to day supervision of these English lodges. Other jurisdictions There are several small Co- Masonic groups in Portugal that admit both men and women such as Le Droit Humain. There is also a small unrecognised jurisdiction named Grande Loja Nacional Portuguesa.

It opened in 2006. Much of the complex sits on the former site of the Cascade, the first movie theater of the Warner Bros., hence the name. The complex is at the corner of East Washington Street and Mill Street. As of 2013, the complex is owned by Riverplex Partners, Inc. The top three stories are rented by Refresh Dental Management as their corporate headquarters. History The Warners, residents of nearby Youngstown, Ohio, were sons of Polish Jews wanting to break into the then-fledgling film business. The brothers, after successfully showing a used copy of The Great Train Robbery at Idora Park in Youngstown,Warner (1964), pp. 49-54. traveled to New Castle to screen the movie in a vacant store on the site of what would become the Cascade Center.Warner and Jennings (1964), pp. 54-55. This makeshift theatre, called the Bijou, was furnished with chairs borrowed from a local undertaker. In 1906, the brothers purchased a small theater in New Castle near the Bijou, which they called the Cascade Movie Palace, taking its name from nearby Cascade Park. They maintained the theater until moving into film distribution in 1907. Gradually over time, the building that housed the Bijou would host other business while the Cascade itself would eventually be demolished to make way for a parking lot. The buildings themselves would become abandoned by the 1980s when New Castle, like most other Rust Belt cities, saw the collapse of the steel industry having a ripple effect in the region with the population dropping as well as the general suburbanization effect that had been happening throughout the United States since the 1950s. By the mid-1990s, only two businesses were open on the site that would become the Cascade Center. One of them, Main Street Clothiers & Custom Tailors, is a men's suit shop that was housed in the building that also housed the Bijou. The other would be the B&O; Railroad Federal Credit Union, a credit union that was in a separate purpose- built building on the site bordering Mill Street and the Neshannock Creek and had actually been built on the site of the Cascade after the site was used as a parking lot. In 1996, parts of the wall of the building that housed the Bijou collapsed onto East Washington Street, one of the cities main thoroughfares. The portion that collapsed was next door to Main Street Clothiers, which had just opened three years before on the site. The city of New Castle was very close to issuing a condemnation notice to the building, but at the 11th hour the building's historical significance was discovered, saving the building. The city then announced redevelopment plans to make it what would eventually become the Cascade Center. Development The city took most of the property by eminent domain and stabilized the parts of the wall that had collapsed, closing off the sidewalk in front of the building to prevent accidents until the wall could be completely rebuilt. The city was later able to persuade the B&O; Credit Union‚Äînow the First Choice Federal Credit Union‚Äîto temporarily move into the nearby mall, the Cascade Galleria, so that the property could be bought and made into the Cascade Center. (The credit union eventually moved out of the mall back into their own building out in neighboring Union Township.) Main Street Clothiers was allowed to stay in the building where they remain today, and although their portion of the building is not officially part of the Cascade Center they do advertise in the complex, and have even expanded their business by screen-printing T-shirts as well as serving as the area's J. C. Penney Catalog Center after Rite Aid acquired Eckerd Pharmacy in 2007 and ended the J. C. Penney Catalog Center's in the former Eckerd locations after they were converted to Rite Aid. Coincidentally, Main Street sits next door to a former J. C. Penney (not the side that had the wall collapse) that is currently being remodeled and eventually having a coffee shop open in the building. Although the downtown streets & sidewalks were rebuilt in the early 2000s to resemble the turn of the 19th century, the complex itself wouldn't begin reconstruction until 2003 and was completed in 2006. The interiors of the existing buildings were completely gutted out while the site of the Cascade itself was completely rebuilt into a close replication of the Cascade. Both the old sections and the newly built sections are like one building inside. The city was also able to acquire the former Mellon Bank parking lot and rebuild it as the parking lot for downtown in general and the Cascade Center specifically. The alley that ran along Neshannock Creek behind the buildings was permanently closed and added on to the property of the complex, which became a promenade that leads to an outdoor amphitheater between the former J. C. Penney building and the creek along East Washington Street. The northern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 65 (which runs along East Washington Street) was extended over a mile to near the complex on the other side of the creek. Much like Station Square in Pittsburgh, the complex is an example of adaptive reuse, and focuses on the early years of motion pictures much like Station Square focuses on trains. The complex largely remains vacant, although businesses have started to open up and events being held both inside the complex and at the amphitheater. The complex has also help draw businesses to downtown. Despite the historical connection to the Warner Bros. studio, the complex has no association with Time Warner, the current parent company of Warner Bros. Entertainment. Cass Warner, the granddaughter of Harry Warner, did visit the complex just before it officially opened in 2006. Tenants Although at one point the complex had three tenants, in 2010 all three closed for unknown reasons and the complex was put up for sale. The outdoor promenade and amphitheater, which are publicly owned, are still used by the city for downtown events. Main Street Clothiers and Custom Tailors, while in the building where the Cascade Center is located, is not an official part of the complex, since it has outdoor access only instead of indoor access like the rest of the businesses and also was pre-existing before the creation of the complex. Reinvestment in the center has picked up in recent years, with the Two Rivers Coffee Shop and The Commonwealth restaurant both opening in 2014.

Its only known species, Darwinius masillae, lived approximately 47 million years ago (Lutetian stage) based on dating of the fossil site.Mertz, D. F., Renne, P. R. (2005): A numerical age for the Messel fossil deposit (UNESCO World Heritage Site) derived from 40Ar/39Ar dating on a basaltic rock fragment. Courier Forschungsinstitut Senckenberg no 255: pp 7‚Äì75. The only known fossil, called Ida, was discovered in 1983 at the Messel pit, a disused quarry near the village of Messel, about 35 km (22 mi) southeast of Frankfurt, Germany. The fossil, divided into a slab and partial counterslab after the amateur excavation and sold separately, was not reassembled until 2007. The fossil is of a juvenile female, approximately overall length, with the head and body length excluding the tail being about . It is estimated that Ida died at about 80‚Äì85% of her projected adult body and limb length. The genus Darwinius was named in commemoration of the bicentenary of the birth of Charles Darwin, and the species name masillae honors Messel where the specimen was found. The creature appeared superficially similar to a modern lemur. The authors of the paper describing Darwinius classified it as a member of the primate family Notharctidae, subfamily Cercamoniinae, suggesting that it has the status of a significant transitional form (a \\"link\\") between the prosimian and simian (\\"anthropoid\\") primate lineages. Others have disagreed with this placement.Fossil primate challenges Ida's place Nature 461, 1040 (2009) Concerns have been raised about the claims made about the fossil's relative importance and the publicising of the fossil before adequate information was available for scrutiny by the academic community. Some of Norway's leading biologists, among them Nils Christian Stenseth, have called the fossil an \\"exaggerated hoax\\" and stated that its presentation and popular dissemination \\"fundamentally violate scientific principles and ethics.\\"Amundsen, Trond; Folstad, Ivar; Giske, Jarl; Slagsvold, Tore; Stenseth, Nils Chr. 'Ida' er oversolgt , Aftenposten‚Äì Ida er en oversolgt bl√∏ff, Nettavisen‚Äì Dette er ingen 'missing link', Dagbladet, 20 May 2009 Taxonomy Franzen et al. (2009) place the genus Darwinius in the subfamily Cercamoniinae of the family Notharctidae within the extinct infraorder Adapiformes of early primates. Darwinius masillae is the third primate species to be discovered at the Messel locality that belongs to the cercamoniine adapiforms, in addition to Europolemur koenigswaldi and Europolemur kelleri. Darwinius masillae is similar but not directly related to Godinotia neglecta from Geiseltal. The adapiforms are early primates which are known only from the fossil record, and it is unclear whether they form a monophyletic or a paraphyletic grouping. They are usually grouped under Strepsirrhini‚Äîincluding lemurs, aye-ayes and lorisoids‚Äîand as such would not be ancestral to Haplorrhini, which includes tarsiers and simians.Callum Ross, Richard F. Kay, Anthropoid origins: new visions, Springer, 2004, , p. 100 Simians are usually called \\"anthropoid\\": while this term can be confusing, the paper uses it, as does associated publicity material. Simians (anthropoids) include monkeys and apes, which in turn includes humans. CT image of the skull of Darwinius. Franzen et al. in their 2009 paper place Darwinius in the \\"Adapoidea group of early primates representative of early haplorhine diversification\\". This means that, according to these authors, the adapiforms would not be entirely within the Strepsirrhini lineage as hitherto assumed, but would qualify as a transitional fossil (a \\"missing link\\") between Strepsirrhini and Haplorrhini, and so could be ancestral to humans. They also suggest that tarsiers have been misplaced in the Haplorrhini and should be considered Strepsirrhini. To support this view they show that as many as six morphological traits found in \\"Darwinius\\" are derived characters present only in the Haplorrhini lineage, but absent in the Strepsirrhini lineage, which they interpret as synapomorphies. These include, among others, a cranium with a short rostrum, deep mandibular ramus, loss of all grooming claws. They note \\"that Darwinius masillae and adapoids contemporary with early tarsioids could represent a stem group from which later anthropoid primates evolved, but we are not advocating this here, nor do we consider either Darwinius or adapoids to be anthropoids.\\" =Concerns over cladistic analysis= Paleontologists have expressed concern that the cladistic analysis compared only 30 traits when standard practice is to analyze 200 to 400 traits and to include fossils such as anthropoids from Egypt and the primate genus Eosimias which were not included in the analysis. This contrasts with the motive openly stated by the authors, which was to list 30 anatomical and morphological characteristics \\"commonly used\\" to distinguish extant strepsirrhine and haplorrhine primates. Paleontologist Richard Kay of Duke University thought the data could have been cherry-picked. Paleontologist Callum Ross of the University of Chicago considered the claim that Darwinius should be classified as haplorhine was \\"unsupportable in light of modern methods of classification.\\" The opinion of Chris Beard, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, was that Darwinius was not a \\"missing link\\" between anthropoids and more primitive primates, but that further study of this remarkably complete specimen would be very informative and could reveal relationships amongst \\"the earliest and least human-like of all known primates, the Eocene adapiforms.\\" In an interview published on 27 May 2009, J√∏rn Hurum stated that he had an open mind about the possibility that the fossil might turn out to be a lemur and that a paper on systematics to be published within about a year would mainly focus on the partial counterslab containing the inner ear and the foot bones. Most experts hold that the higher primates (simians) evolved from Tarsiidae, branching off the Strepsirrhini before the appearance of the Adapiformes. A smaller group agrees with Franzen et al. that the higher primates descend from Adapiformes (Adapoidea). The view of paleontologist Tim White is that Darwinius is unlikely to end the argument. Philip D. Gingerich states that the seven superfamilies of primates are commonly associated in the higher taxonomic groupings of suborders Anthropoidea and Prosimii as an alternative to Haplorhini and Strepsirrhini, depending on the position of Adapoidea and Tarsioidea. He puts forward a phylogeny in which the higher primates evolved from Darwinius, which he groups with other Adapoidea. He shows the Adapoidea together with the Tarsioidea as representing early diversification of the suborder Haplorhini and shows the Strepsirrhini as having branched off directly from the earliest primates. The Revealing the Link website uses this taxonomic grouping and states that Darwinius is from an early group of primates just prior to diversification into the anthropoids (monkeys, apes and humans) and the prosimians (lemurs, lorises and tarsiers). Erik Seiffert and colleagues at Stony Brook University argue that Darwinius is on the branch towards the Strepsirrhini and is not a 'missing link' in the evolution of the Anthropoidea. A phylogenetic analysis of 360 morphological characters in 117 extinct and modern primates places Darwinius in a now-extinct group of strepsirrhines along with a newly discovered 37-million-year-old Egyptian primate, Afradapis. Seiffert believes that characteristics that appeared to show a relationship to haplorrhines are due to convergent evolution and has said that \\"the PR hype surrounding the Darwinius description was very confusing.‚Äù Type specimen Counter-slab of the Darwinius masillae holotype fossil (specimen WDC-MG-210 reversed for comparison). Parts 1 and 2 (enclosed in dashed lines) are genuine; remainder of plate B was fabricated during preparation The type specimen is missing only its left rear leg. It has been named Ida after the daughter of J√∏rn Hurum, the Norwegian vertebrate paleontologist from the Natural History Museum, University of Oslo, who secured one section of the fossil from an anonymous owner and led the research. In addition to the bones, remains of Ida's soft tissue and fur outline are present along with remnants of her last meal of fruit and leaves. The animal is about from nose to tail, or roughly the size of a small, long- tailed cat. The lemur-like skeleton of the fossil features primate characteristics of grasping hands with opposable thumbs and nails instead of claws. These would have provided a \\"precision grip\\" which, for Ida, was useful for climbing and gathering fruit. Ida also has flexible arms and relatively short limbs. The fossil is missing two anatomical features found in modern lemurs: a grooming claw on the foot and a fused row of teeth, a toothcomb, in the bottom jaw. Digital reconstructions of Ida's teeth reveal that she has unerupted molars in her jaw, indicating by comparison with modern squirrel monkeys that she was 9‚Äì10 months old and would have reached adulthood at 36 months. The shape of Ida's teeth provides clues as to her diet; jagged molars would have allowed her to slice food, suggesting that she was a leaf and seed eater. This is confirmed by the remarkable preservation of her gut content. Furthermore, the lack of a baculum (penis bone) found in all lower primates means that the fossil was from a female. X-rays performed on Ida revealed that her right wrist was healing from a fracture which may have contributed to her death. The scientists speculate whether she was overcome by carbon dioxide fumes while drinking from the Messel lake. Hampered by her broken wrist, she slipped into unconsciousness, was washed into the lake and sank to the bottom, where unique fossilisation conditions preserved her for 47 million years.Scientists Unveil Missing Link In Evolution An early article on Yahoo.com Discovery and acquisition Map showing where Darwinius (6) and other primates have been found in the Messel pit The events regarding the original unearthing of the fossil are not clear, though some facts are known. It was found at the Messel pit in 1983, a disused shale quarry noted for its astonishing fossil preservation, near the village of Messel about southeast of Frankfurt am Main in Germany. The fossil came as a slab and partial counter slab and was expertly prepared by encasing each slab in resin using the transfer technique necessary to conserve Messel fossils. At some point the slab and counter slab went separate ways. The counter slab was incorporated in a composite of fabricated parts to represent a complete specimen and arrived at a private Wyoming museum in 1991. Analysis by Jens Franzen of the Natural History Museum of Basel, Switzerland revealed the mixed actual and faked nature of this slab.Franzen, J.L. (1994), in Anthropoid Origins (eds Fleagle, J. F. & Kay, R. F.)pp 99-122 (Plenum, New York) A comparison of the two slabs indicates that the forger had access to the whole fossil. Radiographs of the Darwinius holotype fossil, revealing the fabricated parts of the counter-slab The primary slab remained in Germany in the possession of a private collector who kept it secret for twenty years before deciding to sell it anonymously via a German fossil dealer.Fossil Ida: extraordinary find is 'missing link' in human evolution, a 19 May 2009 article from The Guardian Two German museums turned it down as too expensive. A year later at the Hamburg Fossil and Mineral Fair in December 2006, the dealer asked Norwegian vertebrate palaeontologist J√∏rn Hurum, who had done some previous deals, to discuss something privately. The dealer showed Hurum three high resolution colour photographs of the fossil and told him that the asking price was $1 million. Hurum knew that it was a primate and according to Tudge's book \\"was fast concluding that the specimen he was looking at could be one of the holy grails of science ‚Äî the 'missing link' from the crucial time period.\\" He asked for time until after Christmas to organise funding to pay for the specimen and ensure that it had been legally collected, had an export permit and would be legitimately available for study. His first choice was the Natural History Museum of Oslo, but it was beyond their means and he began to think of other museums with sponsors available. He persuaded the Oslo museum to make half the funding available with the remainder to be paid only after X-ray scans proved conclusively that it was not a fake, a process which took several months. He put together a team including leading German experts on the Messel fossils, ensuring international ownership. After its acquisition it was studied in secret for two years by a team of scientists led by Hurum, who was joined by primate evolution expert Professor Philip Gingerich of the University of Michigan and palaeontologists Jens Franzen, who had studied the counter slab, and J√∂rg Habersetzer of the Senckenberg Museum's Research Institute. Publication While studies were in progress, negotiations were put in place for a book and with various broadcasters for documentary programs, all of whom agreed to keep the project secret. A deal went through in the summer of 2008 with The History Channel which has been reported as paying more for this than any other documentary. The team decided to publish their findings online in PLoS ONE, an open access journal of the Public Library of Science. The paper for publication was received by PLoS ONE on March 19, 2009 and accepted on May 12, 2009. On 15 May The Wall Street Journal carried a report with interviews with Gingerich and with Tim White, who cautioned that \\"Lemur advocates will be delighted, but tarsier advocates will be underwhelmed\\". At about the same time a press release headed \\"World Renowned Scientists Reveal a Revolutionary Scientific Find That Will Change Everything\\" announced that the find was \\"lauded as the most significant scientific discovery of recent times.\\" On May 19, 2009 the team revealed their findings to the world at a press conference simultaneously with online publication of the paper in PLoS ONE (for naming purposes, the paper was officially published in print on May 21, 2009). The paper included a statement that the authors were not advocating the possibility that the species could be ancestral to later anthropoid primates; Professor John Fleagle, of Stony Brook University in New York state, asserted that he was one of the anonymous scientific reviewers of the paper and that he had explicitly requested before publication that the authors tone down their original claims that the fossil was on the human evolutionary line. At the press conference the fossil was described as the \\"missing link\\" in human evolution. Hurum said that ‚Äúthis fossil rewrites our understanding of the evolution of primates...it will probably be pictured in all the textbooks for the next 100 years\\" and compared its importance to the Mona Lisa. He also said that Darwinius was \\"the closest thing we can get to a direct ancestor\\" and that finding it was \\"a dream come true\\". Team member Jens Franzen said the state of preservation was \\"like the Eighth Wonder of the World\\", with information \\"palaeontologists can normally only dream of\\", but while he said it bore \\"a close resemblance to ourselves\\" in some aspects, other features indicated that it was not a direct ancestor. Independent experts were quick to question the claims. Henry Gee, a senior editor at Nature, said the term \\"missing link\\" was misleading and that the scientific community would need to evaluate its significance, which was unlikely to match that of Homo floresiensis or feathered dinosaurs. Chris Beard, curator of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, said he \\"would be absolutely dumbfounded if it turns out to be a potential ancestor to humans.\\" Publicity and media coverage Life restoration of Darwinius Having previously experienced how the blogosphere had picked up on his work, and seen Chinese dinosaur finds the object of bad early descriptions from blogging, J√∏rn Hurum decided to orchestrate launch of the fossil in a combined scientific and public event. Atlantic Productions, which had cooperated with Hurum on a program on the Predator X, a giant pliosaur from Svalbard, was brought in on the project in order to \\"take story straight to the masses in a way that would appeal to the average person, especially kids\\". The press conference and paper on the fossil was accompanied by the launch of a website the publication of a book which had already been distributed to bookstores, The Link: Uncovering Our Earliest Ancestor by Colin Tudge,Tudge, Colin. (2009). The Link: Uncovering Our Earliest Ancestors. Little Brown. and the announcement of a documentary (Uncovering Our Earliest Ancestor: The Link), made by Atlantic Productions in the UK, directed by Tim Walker and produced by Lucie Ridout, to be screened six days later on the History Channel (US), BBC One (UK), and various stations in Germany and Norway. The New York Daily News noted that \\"The unveiling of the fossil came as part of an orchestrated publicity campaign unusual for scientific discoveries\\". One of the paper's co-authors, paleontologist Philip D. Gingerich, expressed dissatisfaction with the media campaign, telling The Wall Street Journal that they had chosen to publish in PLoS ONE as \\"There was a TV company involved and time pressure\\" and they had been pushed to finish the study. \\"It's not how I like to do science\\", Gingerich concluded. In an interview, J√∏rn Hurum said that PLoS ONE had been chosen as it was open access and the research had been funded by Norwegian taxpayers who would benefit from free access, it did not restrict the length of manuscript or number of illustrations, and \\"PLoS ONE is the quickest way to publish a large work in the world!\\" At the time its discovery was announced in the scientific and the popularA History Channel documentary, The Link, devoted to the discovery is slated to air 25 May 2009. press, the fossil was characterized as the \\"most complete fossil primate ever discovered\\"; Sir David Attenborough has described it as \\"extraordinary\\".The Implications from revealingthelink.com Google commemorated the unveiling with a themed logo on May 20, 2009. During a ceremony at the American Museum of Natural History Hurum said that \\"This specimen is like finding the Lost Ark for archeologists\\" and \\"It is the scientific equivalent of the Holy Grail. This fossil will probably be the one that will be pictured in all textbooks for the next 100 years.\\" Regarding the publicity, Matt Cartmill an anthropologist from Duke University said \\"The P.R. campaign on this fossil is I think more of a story than the fossil itself\\". Independent experts have raised concern about publicity exaggerating the importance of the find before information was available for scrutiny. Chris Beard, curator of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, was \\"awestruck\\" by the publicity machine but concerned that if the hype was exaggerated, it could damage the popularisation of science if the creature was not all that it was hyped up to be. Paleoanthropologist Elwyn Simons of Duke University stated that it is a wonderful specimen but most of the information had been previously known, and paleoanthropologist Peter Brown of the University of New England said that the paper had insufficient evidence that Darwinius was ancestral to the simians. Others have also criticized claims that the fossil represents the \\"missing link in human evolution\\", arguing that there is no such thing unless evolution is visualized as a chain as there are an enormous number of missing branches, and that while the fossil is a primate, there is no evidence to suggest that its species is a direct ancestor of humans. ScienceBlogger Brian Switek questioned the sensationalist coverage of claims of ancestral relationships made before a full cladistic analysis, and in a column in The Times he stated that a unique opportunity to communicate science had been lost, with press releases forestalling the necessary discovery and debate which should now proceed. Hurum considered that the risk of buying the fossil had paid off, and said that \\"You need an icon or two in a museum to drag people in, this is our Mona Lisa and it will be our Mona Lisa for the next 100 years.\\" He has been described as \\"a modern-era, media-savvy scientist with the right amounts of showmanship, populist sensibility, and disregard for the normal avenues of scientific prestige required to pull this off\\". The debut in \\"an astonishingly slick, multi-component media package\\" required exceptional coordination between networks, museums, producers and scientists while maintaining a level of secrecy which is hard to attain in modern circumstances. In interviews published on 27 May, Hurum stated that it was good that they had got the message out that primates were rooted deep in time, but that some of the slogans were too much and the publicity got completely out of control. He disclosed that he paid nearly $750,000 (¬£465,000) for the specimen, but felt it was worthwhile to make the fossil available for scientific investigation instead of it being bought by a private collector and hidden away. Others including Chris Beard were concerned that the price and publicity could lead to profiteering by amateur collectors, and make acquisition of specimens for research purposes more difficult.

Drawing on the theories of Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud, and Melanie Klein, analytic music therapy involves the use of musical improvisation to interpret unconscious processes.Nordic Journal of Music Therapy: Exploring Relationships Between Mary Priestley's Life and Work (Abstract) Born 4 March 1925 in England, she was the premarital child of English playwright and author, J. B. Priestley, and mother Jane Wyndham-Lewis. Her father was a vocalist skilled at playing by ear while her mother was a trained pianist. Priestley studied piano, violin, and composition in her youth. Her battle with bipolar disorder resulted in psychiatric hospitalizations throughout her life and may be said to have given her insights into psychoanalysis through the combination of verbal processing and nonverbal expression found in improvised music with a structured, purposeful framework. Her interest in music therapy was sparked upon hearing a lecture by music therapist Juliette Alvin. Priestley wrote Music Therapy in Action (1975), subsequently lecturing and educating others in her method. Temple University (Philadelphia) has created an archive of Priestley's published writings, along with those of others on the topic of Analytical Music Therapy.

The ciaramedda is native to the rural areas of Sicily and Calabria, particularly in the provinces of Messina and Reggio Calabria, though it can also be found in the provinces of Catania, Agrigento, Enna, Siracusa and as far north as Catanzaro. The instrument consists of a bag (usually of goatskin), a blowpipe to inflate the bag, and two chanters which play a melody and harmony (or counter-rhythm), which are generally made of heather wood or any type of native grown fruit wood. The three drones, which provide constant harmony, are known as bassu, quatta, and fisciettu. Some pipes just have two drones. In Sicily, often only the middle drone is reeded while the other two remain muted and serve only as decoration. The ciaramedda became less prominent in Sicilian culture with the decline of European pastoral culture, however it survives in the context of religious festivals, particularly during Christmas. In Reggio Calabria the instrument still enjoys secular use and is one of the principal instruments used in communal dances, accompanied by a tambourine to play the tarantella.

In Australia it occurs from Kiama (34¬∞ S) in New South Wales to the Endeavour River (15¬∞ S) in tropical Queensland. It also grows at Norfolk Island, eastern Malesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. In Australia it is commonly known as native celtis or investigator tree. Often seen in coastal areas, but may also be found up to 800 metres above sea level.  Description  The tree grows to 40 metres tall and 90 cm in trunk width, though usually much smaller. The trunk is mostly cylindrical and somewhat buttressed at the base. The bark is thin, greyish brown and smooth, with pustular vertical lines. = Leaves = Leaves are elliptical in shape with a prominent leaf tip. Leaves are alternate and simple, smooth, not toothed, 6 to 10 cm long with a pointed tip. The leaf stalk is somewhat channelled and flattened on the top, and 6 to 10 mm in length. Both sides of the leaf are of a dull green shade. With a hand lens, translucent glands may be seen in the leaves. The base of the leaf is often oblique, that is of unequal length on either side of the leaf stem. Leaf venation is more evident under the leaf. An identifying feature is the intramarginal leaf vein, which starts at the leaf base and travels on either edge of the leaf, a distance of ¬º to ¬Ω the length of the leaf. = Flowers and fruit = Green flowers in axilliary cymes or panicles appear from December to January. The fruit is a black, round to oval shaped drupe, 8 to 10 mm long. containing a single seed. The seed has veiny ridges. Fruit matures from July to March.  Taxonomy & Naming  This plant first appeared in scientific literature as Solenostigma paniculatum in 1833, published in the Prodromus Florae Norfolkicae by the Austrian botanist Stephan Endlicher. The type specimen was collected at Norfolk Island by the artist Ferdinand Bauer. The specific epithet paniculata refers to the tufted and branched flowers.In 1848 Jules √âmile Planchon moved the species to the Celtis genus. Other common names include Native Hackberry, Silky Keltis, Silky Celtis, Tripewood and Whitewood. = Investigator Tree = The original \\"Investigator Tree\\" grew on Sweers Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria, named after Matthew Flinders' ship. The island was an important port on a major thoroughfare for 19th century Australian explorers. Later members of other expeditions in Australia‚Äôs maritime history made carvings on this tree.  Germination and seedlings  Removal of the flesh from the seed is not advised when sowing. Germination takes between 48 to 100 days. The cotyledons are large, about 30 x 25 mm with an apex divided into two acute lobes. The first pairs of juvenile leaves are often toothed. At the tenth leaf stage leaves become oval in shape with a prominent tip. cotyledons  Ecology & Uses  Celtis paniculata is a food tree for the blue beak, common aeroplane, tailed emperor and other butterflies. Many rainforest pigeons and other birds feed on the fruit. An endangered population of the beetle Menippus darcyi feeds on Celtis paniculata. The tree produces a useful general purpose timber, with a specific gravity of 0.70.

The ball was officially presented on 2 December 2007 during the group draw for the final tournament. For the final, a silver version, the Europass Gloria, was used. The same ball but with different design (depending on competition) was used in UEFA Champions League from 2008 through 2009 and in 2009 UEFA Super Cup and 2009‚Äì10 UEFA Europa League. The Terrapass, similar to Europass ball, was used in the 2009 European Under-21 and Women's European Championship, as well as some international matches. Technical Information The ball is made of 14 panels instead of the traditional 32 panels. Its construction is similar to the Teamgeist, which was used for the 2006 World Cup but with new PSC (creeps) surface design. The edges are thermally bonded instead of being stitched and a special adhesive is used for durability and water resistance. Criticism Majority of the criticism the ball faced came from goalkeepers. Germany's goalkeeper coach, Andreas K√∂pke, said to reporters, \\"Basically no one is 100 percent satisfied with this ball.\\" He added, \\"It is pointless to lament this,\\" adding that his team had tried to make the best of it. \\"[But] I don't think we will get more goals because the ball swirls.\\" \\"I have had a few problems with the official balls, I only started working with them a week ago, but they are very different from the ones used for the 2006 World Cup. During the first half, I went to catch the ball and it started to float a bit,\\" German goalkeeper Jens Lehmann had complained. Co-host Austria's goalkeeper, Alexander Manninger, as well as Czech goalkeeper Petr ƒåech, also expressed their dissatisfaction, with the former stating, \\"This ball is not the keeper's friend.\\" Italian goalkeepers likewise were not very satisfied with the ball. Gianluigi Buffon said, \\"Maybe we just have to get used to it. But it won't matter, I'll get the ball anyway.\\" Meanwhile, Marco Amelia told reporters, \\"It changes direction. To not make a mess trying to stop it, it's better to beat it away.\\" Adidas replied to all the criticism by saying, \\"The ball's new surface structure allows players to control and direct it perfectly in all weather conditions.\\" It also pointed out that the ball's new surface texture on the outer skin guaranteed \\"optimum grip between ball and boot\\", as well as better grip between glove and ball for goalkeepers.

In 1945, Kang established the Kyoung Dong Presbyterian Church in Seoul. This church would become the starting point for the spread of the Presbyterian Church within South Korea. After this, he served as General Secretary of the Korean Student Christian Federation in 1948. In 1964 and again in 1980, he was President of the National Council of Churches in Korea. In 1962, Kang founded the Korean Christian Academy to facilitate dialog between South Korea's many religions. He served as its director and president. Through the Academy's committee for interfaith dialogue, Yong sponsored over one hundred meetings among leaders of South Korea's six leading religions. He was arrested in 1979 by the National Intelligence Service of Korea for alleged subversive activity. Kang served two terms as President of the Christian Conference of Asia from 1968 to 1983. From 1975 to 1983, he was a member of the Central Committee and of the Executive Committee of the World Council of Churches. In the early 1970s, he initiated and contributed towards the founding of the ecumenical academy Association of Christian Institutes and Study Centres in Asia (ACISCA). Also in the 1970s, Kong lead movements for human rights and democracy in Korea, holding hundreds of dialogs with military leaders to encourage reconciliation and a return to democratic process. Kang promoted interfaith dialog towards reconciliation in a divided Korea, serving as president of the Asian Conference on Religion and Peace and a chairman of the Korean Foundation for Working Together. Yong was an advocate of ecumenism and co-operation between religions. He worked to provide ways for the church to reach the disenfranchised in Asia so that it could provide a voice for them. Kong was awarded the Niwano Peace Prize in 2000.

The name PSR B1937+21 is derived from the word \\"pulsar\\" and the declination and right ascension at which it is located, with the \\"B\\" indicating that the coordinates are for the 1950.0 epoch. PSR B1937+21 was discovered in 1982 by Don Backer, Shri Kulkarni, Carl Heiles, Michael Davis, and Miller Goss. It is the first discovered millisecond pulsar, with a rotational period of 1.557708 milliseconds, meaning it completes almost 642 rotations per second. This period was far shorter than astronomers considered pulsars capable of reaching, and led to the suggestion that pulsars can be spun-up by accreting mass from a companion. The rotation of PSR B1937+21, along with other millisecond pulsars discovered later, are very stable in their rotation. They are capable of keeping time as well as atomic clocks. PSR B1937+21 is unusual in that it is one of few pulsars which occasionally emits particularly strong pulses. The flux density of the giant pulses emitted by PSR B1937+21 are the brightest radio emission ever observed. These properties of PSR B1937+21, and its unexpected discovery, are credited with helping revitalize research on pulsars. Background Schematic view of a pulsar. The sphere in the middle represents the neutron star, the curves indicate the magnetic field lines and the protruding cones represent the emission beams. The first pulsar was discovered in 1967 by Jocelyn Bell and her PhD supervisor Antony Hewish using the Interplanetary Scintillation Array. Shortly after the discovery of pulsars, Franco Pacini and Thomas Gold independently suggested that pulsars are highly magnetized rotating neutron stars, which form as a result of a supernova at the end of the life stars more massive than about 10 times the mass of the Sun. The radiation emitted by pulsars is caused by interaction of the plasma surrounding the neutron star with its rapidly rotating magnetic field. This interaction leads to emission \\"in the pattern of a rotating beacon,\\" as emission escapes along the magnetic poles of the neutron star. The \\"rotating beacon\\" property of pulsars arises from the misalignment of their magnetic poles with their rotational poles. Discovery In the late 1970s, the radio source 4C21.53 captured the attention of radio astronomers, \\"because of its anomalously high level of interplanetary scintillation.\\" As interplanetary scintillation is associated with compact radio sources, the interplanetary scintillation observations suggested that 4C21.53 might be a supernova remnant, but a pulsar survey carried out at Arecibo Observatory in 1974 by Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor in the region did not discover a pulsar associated with 4C21.53. With the lack of success in finding a pulsar in the region, other explanations for the scintillation were explored, including suggestion of entirely new classes of objects. After realizing in 1982 that previous searches for a pulsar in the region of 4C21.53 were not sensitive to periods short enough to produce the observed scintillation, Don Backer initiated a search in the area that would be sensitive to a wide range of pulse periods and dispersion measures, including very short periods. The initial search plan was to sample at a rate of 500 Hz, which would have been insufficiently fast to detect a pulsar spinning at 642 Hz. To simplify the search apparatus, Backer's then student, Shri Kulkarni, sampled as quickly as was possible, and time averaged the signal over a period of 0.4 milliseconds, thus effectively sampling at 2500 Hz. As a result, Backer et al. determined in November 1982 that the source was a pulsar rotating every 1.558 milliseconds, a rate far beyond anything that astronomers studying pulsars had expected. CharacteristicsAge and spin down rate= When Backer et al. reported their finding in November 1982, they found that the rotation period of PSR B1937+21 was increasing at a rate of 3 seconds per second. Pulsars are expected to slow over time, as the energy that they emit is ultimately drawn from the rotational energy of the pulsar. Using the initially observed values for the period and spin down rate, and assuming a minimum period of 0.5 milliseconds for pulsars, the maximum age for PSR B1937+21 was found to be about 750 million years old. The estimate of the minimum possible period is obtained from the centrifugal break-up limit, which is the rotational period at which the centrifugal force and the self-gravity of the pulsar are equal. The value of the minimum rotational period depends upon the neutron star equation of state, with different models giving values between 0.3 and 1 millisecond, which corresponds to a rotation frequency of 1-3 kilohertz. There may be mechanisms such as gravitational radiation which keep the pulsar from reaching this absolute limit, but pulsars can spin no faster. An age of no more than 750 million years for the PSR B1937+21 was at odds with the observations of the region in other wavelengths. No optical supernova remnant, nor bright x-ray source, had been observed in the vicinity of the PSR B1937+21. If PSR B1937+21 was that young, it would not have had time to move far from the site at which it formed. As neutron stars are formed as the result of supernova explosions, evidence of the explosion should be nearby for a young pulsar. If it was that young, it would also be expected to still be hot, in which case the thermal radiation from PSR B1937+21 would be observable at x-ray wavelengths. Venkatraman Radhakrishnan and G. Srinivasan used the lack of observed supernova remnant to argue that PSR B1937+21 had not formed with such a fast period, but instead had been \\"spun up\\" by a companion star which essentially gave the pulsar its angular momentum, a mechanism now generally used to explain millisecond pulsars. They also made a theoretical estimate of the necessary spin down rate to be 1 seconds per second. Backer et al. revised their estimate of the upper limit of the spin down rate just a month after the initial discovery, to 1 seconds per second, but the currently measured value is more nearly in line with the theoretical estimate, at 1.05 seconds per second. The age of PSR B1937+21 was also later determined to be 2.29 years, a value which is consistent with the observational evidence. The companion which is supposed to have spun-up PSR B1937+21 is no longer present, making it one of few millisecond pulsars which does not have a stellar mass companion. The generally high occurrence of companions to millisecond pulsars is to be expected, considering a companion is necessary to spin-up millisecond pulsars to their short periods. However, millisecond pulsars do not actively accrete matter from a companion, but instead need to have only done this at some time in the past, and thus the lack of companion for PSR B1937+21 is not seen as a being in disagreement with the spin-up model. Possible mechanisms for creating isolated millisecond pulsars include evaporation of the donor star or tidal disruption of the system. =Pulses= During one period of rotation for PSR B1937+21, there are two peaks observed, known as the pulse and interpulse. PSR B1937+21 is unusual among pulsars in that it occasionally produces pulses far brighter than an average pulse. Until 1995, the sole other pulsar known to produce giant pulses was the Crab pulsar, and by 2006, there were 11 pulsars that had been observed to produce giant pulses out of more than 1500 known pulsars. The giant pulses of PSR B1937+21 were first observed in 1984, shortly after its discovery, but difficulty in observing single pulses of PSR B1937+21 due to its fast period meant that the pulses were not studied in more depth until a decade after they were first observed. In more recent follow up observations, more giant pulses have been found. These giant pulses have been observed to occur at the trailing edge of both the pulse and interpulse. The duration of these giant pulses is short compared to the period of the pulsar, lasting on the order of 10 nanoseconds. The flux density of observed pulses is somewhat variable, but has been observed to be as high as 6.5 Wm‚àí2Hz‚àí1 (6.5 janskys). The brightness temperature of a pulse with such high flux density and such low duration exceeds 5 kelvins, making the pulses of PSR B1937+21 the brightest radio emission ever observed. PSR B1937+21 is intrinsically the most luminous millisecond pulsar. In addition to the radio pulses observed, pulses have been detected at x-ray wavelengths, which show the same pulse and interpulse pattern.  Evidence for companions  After the discovery of planetary mass companions around PSR B1257+12 in 1990 by Aleksander Wolszczan, data for PSR B1937+21 and other pulsars were analyzed for the presence of similar companions. By 1994, an upper limit of about one thousandth of the mass of Earth was determined for any companion of PSR B1937+21 within 2 astronomical units. In 1999, Aleksander Wolszczan reported variations in the times of arrival of pulses from PSR B1937+21, as well as previous analysis by Tokio Fukushima which suggested that these timing variations could be caused by a dwarf planet around the pulsar. The data were consistent with a companion having a mass similar to Ceres and located at 2.71 astronomical units from the pulsar, but data over a longer period of time are required in order to verify the proposed companion. More recent observations have not detected any regular periodic signal associated with this companion, but argue that the slight variations in pulse arrival times are consistent with an asteroid belt having a total mass less than 0.05 that of the Earth, but acknowledge that the detection of periodicity in pulse timing variations associated with individual asteroids is necessary to confirm the possible asteroid belt. Significance Until the discovery of PSR J1748-2446ad in 2006, which spins 716 times per second, PSR B1937+21 was the fastest spinning neutron star known. , PSR B1937+21 remains the second fastest spinning pulsar known. In addition to extending the range of periods observed in pulsars by a factor of 20, it also extended the range of magnetic fields observed by a factor of 100, with a magnetic field of 4.2 gauss (42 kT). As the first discovered millisecond pulsar, PSR B1937+21 \\"sparked a 'theory frenzy'\\" by providing a new laboratory in which to study pulsars, neutron stars more generally, and perhaps even some other astrophysical problems such as gravitational waves. For instance, as the density required to spin at such high rates are comparable to nuclear densities, the fastest spinning millisecond pulsars are important in understanding how matter behaves at such densities. The initially high estimate of the spin down rate was also intriguing, as it implied a signal that could be directly detected by gravitational wave detectors, but the actual spin down rate put the expected signal below the sensitivity of current detectors. The currently accepted value spin down rate corresponds to a change in the rotational period of 1.5 Hz over the course of one million years. The stability of rotation of PSR B1937+21 is of the same order of the stability of the best atomic clocks, and is thus a tool used in establishing ephemeris time. The discovery of B1937+21 launched \\"extensive pulsar surveys at all major radio observatories\\" and \\"happened to revitalize pulsar astronomy at a time when most people thought the field was moribund.\\" References Category:Vulpecula Category:Pulsars 12 Category:Hypothetical planetary systems ","title":"PSR B1937+21"},{"id":"22841277","title":"Helen Moulder"},{"id":"22841315","text":"Ruper Ordorika, born at O√±ati (Gipuzkoa) in 1956, is a Basque singer- songwriter.

The Romanian vehicles saw action on the Eastern Front from Operation Barbarossa to the Vienna Offensive. Twenty vehicles were sold to Ethiopia after the war who used them until the Eighties. Romania also created a prototype, called R-1-a.I.Pejƒçoch - Obrnƒõn√° Technikahttp://ftr- wot.blogspot.de/2013/05/romanian-armor-part-i-pre-ww2.html  Description  ƒåeskomoravsk√° Kolben-Danƒõk was determined not to repeat the problems of its earlier Tanƒç√≠k vz. 33 tankette and gave the gunner a turret for better observation and all-around fields of fire for its new AH-IV tankette. It was assembled from a framework of steel \\"angle iron\\" beams, to which armor plates between thick were bolted. The driver sat on the right side using an observation port protected by bulletproof glass and an armored shutter. To his right was a small vision slit. Also to his right, in all models except the Swedish Strv m/37, was a light Zbrojovka Brno ZB vz. 26 or vz. 30 machine gun that was usually locked in place and fired using a Bowden cable. The gunner sat on the left and manned a small turret fitted with a ZB vz. 35 or ZB vz. 37 heavy machine gun in a ball mount. Most of the machine gun's barrel protruded from the mount and was protected by an armored trough. He had a large vision port to the right of the machine gun mount in the turret and a small vision slit on the left side of the superstructure. 3700 rounds were carried for the two machine guns. No radio was fitted.Kliment and Francev, pp. 109-115 The , water-cooled, six-cylinder Praga engine produced at 2,500 rpm. It sat in the rear of the fighting compartment and drove the transmission via a drive shaft that ran forward between the driver and commander to the gearbox. Cooling was designed to draw air in through the commander's and driver's hatches. This had the advantage of rapidly dispersing gun combustion gases when firing, but several disadvantages. The constant draft generated by the engine greatly affected the crew during cold weather, an engine fire would force the crew to evacuate and the engine noise and heat increased crew fatigue. It had a top speed on the road of and a range between . The semi-automatic Praga-Wilson transmission had five forward gears and one reverse gear to drive the forward- mounted drive sprocket. The suspension was a smaller version of that used in the Panzerkampfwagen 38(t). It consisted of four large road wheels per side, each pair mounted on a wheel carrier and sprung by leaf springs. There were two wheel carriers per side. The idler wheel was at the rear and one return roller was fitted. It had a ground pressure of only 0.5 kg/cm2. It could cross a ditch wide, climb an obstacle high and ford a stream deep.  Variants Iran= Iran was the first customer for the AH-IV and ordered fifty plus a prototype in 1935 for delivery the following year. Deliveries began in August 1936 with the last batch arriving in Iran in May 1937, although the armament was shipped separately and wasn't installed until November 1937. The Iranians were well pleased with their vehicles and planned to order between 100 and 300 additional AH-IVs, but the outbreak of World War II prevented any follow- through. Their tankettes were the smallest of the series at only and differed only slightly in size from the Romanian R-1 tankettes that followed it on the production lines. It could only climb an obstacle high, had a range of and a ground pressure of only 0.45 kg/cm2. It used the ZB vz. 26 and 35 machine guns.Kliment and Francev, pp. 109-112, 281 =Romania= The Romanians signed a contract for 36 AH-IV-R, as they were designated by ƒåKD, on 14 August 1936, including one prototype to be delivered in two months and the entire order in seven months. These deadlines were unable to be met as the Romanians demanded many changes, which all had to be made on the production line because ƒåKD had initiated production of the entire order before the prototype was accepted. The first ten tankettes off the production line were sent to Romania in October 1937 to participate in the autumn maneuvers when they made a favorable impression before being returned to the factory. The production run was completed the next month, but the Romanians refused to accept them as they didn't conform to the specifications. The required modifications took until April 1938 to perform, but another evaluation was required under summer conditions and they weren't formally accepted until August 1938. Nicolae Malaxa bought a license to produce the R-1 as the AH-IV-R was known in Romanian service, in September 1938, but irregularities and disputes over payment delayed the transfer of the production drawings until October 1939. His factory built one prototype, mostly from R-1 spare parts, but never began production.Kliment and Francev, pp. 113-114 =Sweden= Stridsvagn m/37 on display at Swedish Army Museum in Stockholm, Sweden. Sweden ordered forty- eight tankettes in 1937 as the Stridsvagn m/37 (Strv m/37) after a successful demonstration during winter conditions in the Krkono≈°e Mountains. They were to be assembled in Oskarshamn with a more powerful , water-cooled, six-cylinder, Volvo FC-CKD gasoline engine and armor, up to thick, from Avesta, although ƒåKD supplied most of the other components after building one prototype. The vehicle was heavily modified with the driver's machine gun deleted and proved to be the heaviest and largest version of the AH-IV at and a length of , a width of and high.

Both divisions supported the Germans as they attempted to relieve the Stalingrad Pocket in Operation Winter Storm, but were shattered when the Soviets counter-attacked the unsuccessful relief effort in late December 1942.Axworthy, pp. 109-11 Two other cavalry divisions remained in the Kuban bridgehead after the German withdrawal from the Caucasus, but their two remaining serviceable R-1s were withdrawn back to Romania during the spring of 1943 as obsolete.Axworthy, p. 124. On 30 August 1943 only thirteen R-1s were available, all assigned to the Cavalry Training Center, although this increased by one on inventories dated 25 March and 19 July 1944.Axworthy, p. 153 Nothing is known of any action involving R-1s during 1944, but eleven reinforced the 2nd Armored Regiment in Czechoslovakia when it reached the front on 26 March 1945. By 24 April the regiment only had one R-1 available, but none were reported as available after that date.Axworthy, pp. 212-3 =Sweden= The Strv m/37s initially served with the 1st Armored Battalion until the armored brigades began to be formed in 1943‚Äì44.

The typefaces include many special characters intended to replicate the various scribal abbreviations and other unusual glyphs typically found in such manuscripts. They were used in the publication of archival texts between 1774 and 1900. History Record type was originally developed in the 1770s when plans were under way for the publication of Domesday Book. Early experiments in using special typefaces were not successful, but in 1773 the printer John Nichols designed a record type for an extract from Domesday to be included in John Hutchins' History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset (published in 1774). He was so pleased with the result that he and the co-editor of Domesday, Abraham Farley, persuaded the Treasury that the typeface should be adopted for the main Domesday project. It was consequently used in Farley's edition of Domesday Book, published in 1783. Nichols regarded the design as among his greatest achievements, stating that \\"on the correctness and beauty of this important Work, I am prepared to stake my typographical credit\\".Condon and Hallam 1984, pp. 377‚Äì9. The original Domesday type was destroyed in the fire at Nichols' office in 1808,Condon and Hallam 1984, p. 379n. but a modified form of record type was widely used during the first half of the 19th century in the publications of the Record Commission. It was subsequently used in the publications of the Pipe Roll Society from 1884 until 1900; and in 1890 in a single volume published by the Selden Society (despite the misgivings of the society's founder, F. W. Maitland). The Selden Society's experiment was not repeated, and at a General Meeting held in 1903 the Pipe Roll Society decided to abandon record type in favour of publishing its texts \\"in extenso\\" (i.e. with all abbreviations extended). Legacy Record type fell out of favour because its merits (primarily the fact that, given accurate transcription, the reader was presented with exactly what appeared on the manuscript page) were increasingly felt to be outweighed by its disadvantages: the high costs of typesetting and proofreading, and the challenges to the reader presented by a text prepared with minimal editorial intervention.Hunnisett 1977, p. 24. Moreover, technical advances by the late 19th century meant that, in cases where there was a genuine argument for facsimile publication, this could be achieved more satisfactorily, cheaply and accurately by means of photozincography and other photographic printing techniques. Paul Harvey regards record type as falling \\"badly between two stools, giving less than a facsimile on the one hand, less than an extended text on the other\\".Harvey 2001, p. 47. Nevertheless, L. C. Hector has argued that the modest amount of rationalisation and standardisation required to set a manuscript in record type resulted in a \\"half-way stage towards the interpretation of the abbreviations\\" that remains a useful tool to assist the novice in medieval palaeography.Hector 1966, p. 36. Charles Trice Martin's The Record Interpreter (first edition 1892; second edition 1910), which remains a standard handbook for the interpretation of English medieval manuscript texts, employs a version of record type to present abbreviated words. A continuing desire in the digital age to represent the special characters of medieval texts in typographical form is demonstrated by the establishment in 2001 of the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative, which aims to coordinate the encoding and display of such characters.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, Kansas City Royals and Arizona Diamondbacks. College Medlen graduated from Gahr High School in Cerritos, California in 2003. He attended El Camino College his freshman year and hit .296 with 18 RBI's as an infielder. As a pitcher, Medlen posted a 2.84 ERA with 17 K's in 19 innings of work, leading the team with 4 saves. Medlen redshirted the next year, before transferring to Santa Ana College. At Santa Ana, Medlen played as the starting shortstop and hit .332 with 10 HR's and 42 RBI. He also served as the team's closer, posting a 2.23 ERA with 16 saves, striking out 57 in 44.1 innings pitched. Professional careerAtlanta Braves= 2006 Draft  Medlen was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 10th round of the 2006 Major League Baseball draft. The Braves saw promise for Medlen as a relief pitcher, and drafted him with the intention of using him in the bullpen. =Minor league career= Medlen played his first professional baseball game on June 22, 2006, for the Danville Braves of the Appalachian League. He appeared in 20 games for Danville, and pitched a total of 22 innings, being credited with 1 win, no losses, and 10 saves. In those 22 innings, Medlen allowed 14 hits and only 1 earned run. He struck out 36 batters, and allowed only 2 walks. His ERA was 0.41 and his WHIP was 0.727. Medlen played for three of the Braves minor league teams during 2007, progressing from the Rome Braves (single A, South Atlantic League), to the Myrtle Beach Pelicans (high A, Carolina League) and ending the season with the Mississippi Braves (AA, Southern League). His statistics for these three teams were as follows: For the Rome Braves, Medlen appeared in 17 games, logging 20.2 innings, with 33 strike-outs and 3 walks; he had an ERA of 0.87 and a WHIP of 0.774. For the Myrtle Beach Braves, Medlen appeared in 18 games, pitching 24 innings, with 28 strike-outs and 9 walks (2 of them intentional); he had an ERA of 1.12 and a WHIP of 1.230. For the Mississippi Braves, Medlen appeared in only 3 games, for a total of 2.1 innings. He had 2 strike-outs and 2 walks, allowing 4 hits and 3 earned runs (for an ERA of 11.57 and a WHIP of 2.571). Medlen spent the entire 2008 season with the Mississippi Braves of the Southern League. He made 19 relief appearances from April 5 to June 1, and got his first start on June 5, 2012, against the Mobile BayBears (an Arizona Diamondbacks affiliate). He recorded 10 strike-outs in two of his starts, in a 7.0 inning start against the Pensacola Blue Wahoos (on July 7, 2008), a game in which he allowed 4 hits and 1 walk, but also allowed 3 runs, and in a 6.0 inning start against the Carolina Mudcats (on August 22, 2008), a game in which he allowed 3 hits and 1 walk, but no runs. For the season, Medlen started 17 games, with 6 wins and 5 losses. Medlen was named Southern League pitcher of the week on July 14, 2008, after the week in which he had 10 strike-outs against the Blue Wahoos and a win against the Chattanooga Lookouts, in which he allowed 5 hits, 1 walk and 1 run over 6 innings, while striking out 6 batters. Atlanta Braves in 2009 =Major leagues=2009 season Medlen began his major league career as a starter, making his debut on May 21, 2009 pitching just 3.0 innings, giving up 5 earned runs on 3 hits against the Colorado Rockies. Medlen earned his first major league win on May 31, 2009 against the Arizona Diamondbacks pitching 6 innings and giving up only 1 earned run. Medlen went to the Braves bull pen, to make room for rookie starting pitcher Tommy Hanson, and Medlen made his first appearance as a relief pitcher on June 9, 2009, when he pitched scoreless 13th, 14th and 15th innings to get a win against the Pittsburgh Pirates. For the 2009 season, Medlen pitched a total of 67.2 innings, gave up 65 hits and 30 walks, while striking out 72. His record was 3 wins and 5 losses, with an ERA of 4.26. 2010 season On August 5, 2010, Medlen was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a partially torn ulnar collateral ligament tear in his right elbow. It was announced by the Atlanta Braves that he would require Tommy John surgery to repair the damage, ending his season. 2011 season Medlen spent much of the 2011 season rehabbing following the surgery. He was activated from the 60-day disabled list on September 24, 2011, and pitched in only two games. 2012 season Medlen began the 2012 major league season as a reliever for the Atlanta Braves, typically pitching middle innings before the Braves set-up man and closer came on for the 8th and 9th innings. He was sent down to the Braves AAA team (the Gwinnett Braves), for the purpose of \\"stretching him out\\" to return to the majors as a starter. He started only three games for the Gwinnett Braves, pitching 2.1, 5.0 and 6.0 innings and having a record of two losses and one \\"no decision\\". He returned to Atlanta on June 18, 2012, and made 16 appearances in relief, from June 18, 2012 through July 25, 2012. Medlen got his first start of the 2012 season, on July 31, 2012, against the Miami Marlins, allowing 4 hits and 1 earned run and recording the win in a 7‚Äì1 game. After an August 5 \\"no decision\\" against the Houston Astros (which the Braves won by a 6‚Äì1 score), Medlen won five consecutive games in dominating style. On August 11, 2012, in a 9‚Äì3 win against the Mets at Citi Field, Medlen pitched 6.1 innings, allowing 5 hits and 1 walk, while striking out 7. Medlen recorded his first complete game shut-out on August 16, 2012, with a 6‚Äì0 victory over the San Diego Padres, in which allowed 5 hits and struck out 6, allowing no walks. Perhaps the most important win of Medlen's professional career came on August 22, at Washington, with the Braves ending a four-game losing streak that had included two games against the Division-leading Nationals. Medlen pitched 7 innings, allowing 7 hits and 1 walk, while striking out 7. The win allowed the Braves to remain six games behind the Nationals. With the win over the Nationals, Medlen also broke a franchise record with the Braves winning the 16th consecutive game that Medlen had started. Medlen's fourth win in the month of August 2012 came at San Diego, on August 28, with Medlen pitching 8 shut-out innings. Medlen allowed 5 singles, but picked off two of these runners, and no runner moved beyond first base. He struck out 9 Padres, and allowed no walks. Once again, the win by Medlen allowed the Braves to avoid being swept in a three-game series. With this game, Medlen extended his streak of scoreless innings to 28-1/3. On September 3, 2012, Medlen faced the Colorado Rockies at Turner Field, and got the win in dominant fashion. Medlen pitched a complete game, allowing five hits and no walks while striking out a career-best 12 batters. He threw 111 pitches, with 88 of them being strikes. Medlen's streak of consecutive scoreless innings came to an end (at 34-2/3 innings) in the 7th inning when Carlos Gonzalez scored on an error by Paul Janish. This was the longest streak of consecutive scoreless innings for a Braves pitcher since Greg Maddux in 2000. On September 8, 2012, Medlen faced the New York Mets at Citi Field, and recorded his 8th win of the season. Medlen had completed 6 innings, allowing 4 hits and 2 earned runs, when the game was delayed because of rain. Medlen did not return after the 75-minute delay, but got credit for the win in the 11‚Äì3 victory for the Braves. When he allowed an earned run in the 4th inning, his streak of consecutive innings without an earned run ended at 40-1/3 innings. This streak had started at Citi Field on August 11. His streak of innings without allowing a home run ended at 53 innings, when Cedeno hit a home run in the 5th innings. On September 14, 2012, Medlen got the start against the first-place Washington National, at Turner Field, and pitched 7.0 innings, leaving with the score tied at 1‚Äì1. In his 7 innings, Medlen allowed 5 hits and 1 walk, while recording 13 strike-outs, a career high. The Braves went on to win the game 2‚Äì1, with a run in the bottom of the ninth, winning their 20th consecutive game that Medlen had started. This 20 game streak was a franchise record for the Braves and tied a major record set by the New York Yankees and Roger Clemens in 2001. Medlen had 8 called third strikes in the game, the most of any major league pitcher in 2012 and the most for any Braves pitcher since Greg Maddux in 2000. On September 19, 2012, in Atlanta, Medlen pitched 8 scoreless innings, in a game that Atlanta won, 3‚Äì0. Medlen allowed 4 hits and 1 walk, while striking out 6 Marlins. In the 1st and 5th innings, Marlin runners reached third base with only one out, but a strike-out followed by a ground-out and a pop-out followed by a grounder preserved the scoreless game for Medlen. With this win, the Braves had won 21 consecutive games started by Medlen, the most in major league baseball since the Yankees won 22 consecutive games started by Whitey Ford from 1950 through 1953, a span interrupted by his service during the Korean War. On Sep 30, 2012, Medlen led the Braves to their 23rd consecutive victory in games that he started, as they beat the Mets, 6‚Äì2. Medlen pitched 6 Innings, allowing 3 hits, 1 walk and 1 unearned run, while striking out 4. This established a new major league record in that category, according to mlb.com. Medlen started against the St. Louis Cardinals in the MLB's first ever single-game wild card playoff. Medlen pitched 6.1 innings and allowed 5 runs, only 2 earned, on 3 hits. He gave up a home run and was credited with the loss in this game. = Honors = On September 4, 2012, Medlen was named National League \\"Pitcher of the Month\\" for August 2012. In an article discussing the award, Atlanta Journal-Constitution writer David O'Brien pointed out that many commentators have been comparing Kris Medlen to the Braves' legendary pitcher, Greg Maddux. Medlen repeated as National League \\"Pitcher of the Month\\" for September, becoming the first Braves pitcher to win this back-to-back since Greg Maddux, in June and July 2001. 2013 season On June 8, 2013, Medlen hit his first career home run. In 2013, he went 15‚Äì12 with a 3.11 ERA in 32 games (31 starts). In his only postseason appearance in 2013, he pitched 4 innings, and gave up 5 earned runs on 9 hits with a home run. He was credited with the loss, bringing his postseason win‚Äìloss record to 0‚Äì2. 2014 season On March 9, 2014, Medlen left a Spring training game due to a sore right elbow. The following day, he had MRIs which tested positive that there was ligament damage in the elbow. Trying to avoid surgery, he sought a second opinion with Dr. James Andrews. However, Dr. Andrews looked at Medlen's test results, and could only confirm Medlen's worst fears; Medlen needed a second Tommy John surgery, and as a result, Medlen missed the entire 2014 season. Medlen became a free agent on December 2, 2014 after he was non-tendered by the Braves. =Kansas City Royals= Medlen pitching for the Omaha Storm Chasers, triple-A affiliates of the Royals, in On December 18, 2014, he signed a two-year deal (with a mutual option for a third year) with the Kansas City Royals for a guaranteed $8.5 million.Royals sign right-hander Kris Medlen to two-year contract He started the 2015 season on the 60-day disabled list to continue recovering from his second Tommy John surgery and made his first appearance for the Royals on July 20, 2015 against the Pirates. He made his first start for the Royals on Monday, August 24, 2015, against the Baltimore Orioles. He made 15 appearances (8 starts) in 2015 with a 6‚Äì2 record and a 4.01 ERA. He was also part of the Royals postseason run as the team won the 2015 World Series over the New York Mets, their first championship in 30 years. On May 12, 2016, Medlen was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to right rotator cuff inflammation. The Royals declined Medlen's 2017 option on November 4, making him a free agent. =Second stint with the Atlanta Braves= Medlen signed a minor league contract with the Atlanta Braves on January 27, 2017. After not pitching a game in spring training, Medlen was released by the Braves. He resigned a minor league deal on April 1, 2017. He elected free agency on November 6, 2017. =Arizona Diamondbacks= On January 23, 2018, Medlen signed a minor league deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks. After making just one start in the majors and pitching mostly for the Reno Aces, Medlen retired from professional baseball on May 27, 2018. Pitching style Medlen mostly throws four pitches. He leads with a two-seam fastball in the 89‚Äì93 mph range, and he also has a four-seam fastball in that range. His off-speed pitches are a curveball (77‚Äì80) and changeup (80‚Äì83), which are used primarily against right-handers and left-handers, respectively. Lastly, Medlen throws a handful of sliders. Medlen's highly effective changeup has a career whiff rate of 44%, among the highest rates for starting pitchers in the big leagues. Hitters in the 2012 season hit only .098 against the pitch. Personal Medlen met his wife Nicki through former minor league teammate Ryne Reynoso, and married her in 2012. They have two children. Alt URL Medlen is a spokesman for the Rally Foundation.

Probstein (born March 11, 1928) is the Ford Professor of Engineering, Emeritus, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He played a principal role in spacecraft and ballistic missile reentry physics and design, hypersonic flight theory, comet behavior, desalination and synthetic fuels. Biography Probstein was born in New York City. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School and studied engineering at New York City‚Äôs night school, while at the same time working during the day for mathematician Richard Courant. In 1952, he received the first Ph.D. from the Princeton University Department of Aeronautical Engineering. In 1954, he accepted a joint appointment at Brown University in the Division of Applied Mathematics and Division of Engineering and was given tenure two years later. He accepted a position as a Professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT in 1962, and remained there becoming Ford Professor of Engineering until his retirement in 1996, when he became Emeritus. Together with Wallace D. Hayes he wrote the book Hypersonic Inviscid Flow which remains a principal source of basic information on hypersonic flow theory. He applied and generalized these theoretical developments to the design of early American spacecraft and ballistic missiles to enable their reentry into the earth‚Äôs atmosphere without destruction from the high temperatures generated by their hypersonic speeds. In the late 1960s, he developed a theory that predicted the appearance of the fan-shaped tails that appear behind dusty comets. In the early 1970s, he turned his attention to the desalination of salt water and purification of contaminated water. In 1982, he co-authored Synthetic Fuels as a unified and coherent subject. It is the first, and still the only, book providing the underlying principles and possible means for producing fuels to replace natural ones. In the 1990s, he introduced the concept of electrokinetic soil remediation. His basic procedure was patented and licensed to an industrial firm for further development and today the subject has become one that is widely studied and applied worldwide. The scientific basis is outlined in his book on Physicochemical Hydrodynamics: An Introduction, which is a discipline concerned with the interaction between fluid flow and physical, chemical, and biochemical processes. In 2009, he wrote his first book for a general audience - Honest Sid: Memoir of a Gambling Man, published by iUniverse. The book follows the adventures of his father in the world of bookies and bettors, fighters and fixers, set against the often-romanticized backdrop of Depression-era New York City. He has been honored by election to the United States National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the International Academy of Astronautics, and awarded an honorary doctorate from Brown University. He has received many awards including a Guggenheim Fellowship. He recently served on the Committee on America‚Äôs Energy Future of the United States National Research Council.

Backer (November 9, 1943 ‚Äì July 25, 2010) was an American astrophysicist who primarily worked in radio astronomy. Backer made important contributions to the understanding and study of pulsars (including the discovery of the first millisecond pulsar), black holes, and the epoch of reionization. Biography Backer was born in Plainfield, New Jersey. He attended Cornell University, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in engineering physics (B.E.P.) from Cornell University in June 1966. He received a Master of Science degree in radio astronomy from Manchester University in 1968, and then returned to Cornell to earn his doctorate in astronomy in May 1971. Backer then took post-doctoral positions first at NRAO in Charlottesville, Virginia (1971‚Äì1973), and then at NASA/GSFC in Greenbelt, Maryland (1973‚Äì1975). In 1975, Backer moved to the University of California, Berkeley as a research astronomer in the Radio Astronomy Laboratory, and became professor of astronomy at Berkeley in 1989. Backer served as the acting chair of the Berkeley Astronomy Department from 1998 to 1999, as vice chair 1999‚Äì2001, and as chair 2002‚Äì2006 and 2007‚Äì2008. In 2008, he was appointed director of Berkeley's Radio Astronomy Laboratory. Backer collapsed outside his home and died on July 25, 2010. Research Backer's early work focused on pulsars. He discovered the first millisecond pulsar, PSR B1937+21, which rotates at a rate far beyond what was expected of pulsars before its discovery. Backer was also involved in the discovery of a Jupiter-sized planet around PSR B1620-26, thought to be the oldest known extrasolar planet. Backer pioneered efforts to detect gravitational waves from rapidly rotating neutron stars, aiming to set limits on the gravitational wave background of the universe. Backer was also a pioneer in Very Long Baseline Interferometry, a technique in radio astronomy used to achieve high angular resolution images of astronomical sources. His efforts here were directed towards understanding Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Backer then moved on to studying reionization, leading a collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Virginia, the University of Pennsylvania, and NRAO called the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER). The project consists of two arrays of antenna, one in West Virginia and the other in South Africa. These arrays are simple long wavelength telescopes that hope to detect the redshifted hydrogen line from a time very early in the history of the universe when hydrogen was neutral, and by doing so study the first objects that formed in the universe.

He became a brevet general in the Union Army during the American Civil War, a colonel in the Egyptian army and military adviser to the King of Korea. Civil War Dye was born in Washington, Pennsylvania in 1831 and was appointed to West Point in 1849. He graduated in 1853 as a 2nd lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Infantry. By 1859 he was the regimental quartermaster. When the Civil War began in 1861, Dye was a captain in the U.S. Army. However he accepted a commission as colonel of the 20th Iowa Infantry Regiment on August 25, 1862.Eicher p.220 In 1862 Colonel Dye commanded the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division of the Army of the Frontier. Dye led the brigade at the battle of Prairie Grove where his division was under the overall command of Brig. Gen. Francis J. Herron.Prairie Grove Order of Battle The following year, Dye returned to command of his regiment and was part of Herron's division of reinforcements sent to aid the Union army besieging Vicksburg. After the fall of Vicksburg, Dye commanded various brigades in the Department of the Gulf. He was in command of a brigade during the Battle of Brownsville. In May 1864 he was brevetted colonel in the U.S. Army for his service in the Red River Campaign. He led his regiment in the attack on Fort Morgan during the battle of Mobile Bay. For the next year he served in the Reserve Corps in the Department of the Gulf. Once again he led his regiment into battle around Mobile, this time at the battle of Fort Blakely. He was brevetted brigadier general of volunteers dated March 13, 1865 and brevetted colonel U.S.A. on April 9, 1865 for services at Mobile, Alabama.Eicher p.220 His last service in the volunteer army was as the Exchange Agent for POWs in the Military Division of West Mississippi. Egyptian Army General Dye was mustered out of the volunteer service on July 8, 1865. On Jan 14, 1866 he was promoted to major of the 4th U.S. Infantry but in 1870 he was unassigned and discharged from the U.S. Army. In 1868 Civil War veteran, Thaddeus P. Mott, won the confidence of Ismail Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt, and encouraged him to use other Civil War veterans to help modernize the Egyptian army. In 1873 Dye travelled to Egypt to become one of several Union and Confederate veterans who offered their service to the Khedive. There Dye received the rank of colonel. General Charles P. Stone was another American veteran in Egypt who now held the rank of major general in the Egyptian army. Stone first suggested Dye to be the American chief-of-staff in the upcoming campaign against Abyssinia. However, Dye refused the appointment as he had no confidence in the Egyptian commander. The position of chief of staff eventually went to General William W. Loring and Dye was appointed assistant chief-of-staff under Loring.Americans in the Egyptian Army: Dye At the battle of Gura Dye was wounded in the foot and later was court martialed for hitting another Egyptian officer. The matter remained unresolved and he returned to the United States in 1878. Dye would write a book about his experience in the Egyptian Army, titled Moslem Egypt and Christian Abyssinia; Or, Military Service Under the Khedive, in his Provinces and Beyond their Borders, as Experienced by the American Staff. It was published in 1880. Korean government Upon his return to the U.S. Dye served as the Chief of Police in Washington, D.C. In 1888, General Philip H. Sheridan recommended Dye for the position as Chief Military Adviser to the Korean Government under King Gojong. He served the king for the next 11 years, even writing a military treatise in Korean. He returned to the United States in 1899 but died the same year in Muskegon, Michigan.

The headquarters was a tenant unit of Langley Air Force Base, with several outlying support locations. The AFC2IC deactivated in 2013. It had gone through numerous name and organizational changes ‚Äì aligned at one time under the Air Staff ‚Äì since 1997 including Aerospace Command and Control Agency (ASC2A), Air Force Command, Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Center (AFC2ISRC), and Global Cyberspace Integration Center (GCIC) but maintained essentially the same mission throughout. History The center was initially established as the Air and Space Command and Control Agency (ASC2A) on 1 August 1997. The agency included the two major field units that became the Air Force C2 Battlelab and the Air Force C2 Training and Innovation Group. The Tactical Air Forces Interoperability Group (TAFIG) was a predecessor organization under Tactical Air Command. It was focused primarily on tactical interoperability and was a leader in the improvement and integration of Tactical Data Links and message text formats, a responsibility AFC2IC carries on today. Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) was added to the agency's mission and it was re-designated the Aerospace Command and Control Agency (AC2A) on 15 September 1998. A few months later, on 1 January 1999, the AC2A again expanded its mission, taking on responsibilities such as unmanned aerial platforms, and was officially re- designated the Aerospace Command and Control & Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Center (AC2ISRC). The Center eventually gained the Air Force Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Battlelab, and fifteen operating locations intended to network the C2 mission. In 2002, the Center underwent its most profound change organizationally since its creation. On 15 March 2002 the Center was re- designated the Air Force Command and Control & Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Center (AFC2ISRC) and realigned as a field operating agency under the Deputy Chief of Staff for Warfighting Integration (AF/XI); a year later XI was transferred to report to the Secretary of the AF, and the office symbol was changed to SAF/XC). On 2 April 2007, the AFC2ISRC was re-designated the Air Force Global Cyberspace Integration Center (AF GCIC) signifying an Air Force cultural shift to the cyberspace domain while still maintaining its responsibilities for C2 integration. On 16 June 2010, the center was realigned under the ACC Directorate of Requirements (A8) and named the Air Force C2 Integration Center (AFC2IC).\\\\--~~~~ In January 2013, the Commander of Air Combat Command announced his intention to reorganize the headquarters staff to formulate a consolidated Planning, Programming and Requirements Directorate (A5/8/9). As part of this planned reorganization, AFC2IC would be deactivated and its functions and personnel merged into the new A5/8/9 Directorate. An informal closing ceremony for AFC2IC was held on 16 December 2013, officiated by the last Center Director, SES Stan Newberry. Several former leadership figures from the Center's long and productive history were in attendance. =Air Operations Center= The Aerospace Operation Center(AOC) (later Air Operations Center) has been a central mission for the center. Tremendous efforts led the AOC to be declared a weapon system on 8 September 2000. The first Combined Aerospace Operations Center-Experimental (CAOC-X) was built at Langley Air Force Base. The next CAOC built stood up over the following year at Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia, and became the \\"premier C2 weapon system in the world.\\" Leading the AOC innovation effort through large-scale experiments that rapidly delivered capabilities onto the battlefield, the Center's efforts collectively marked a seven-year period of modernizing, standardization, and seamless integration. =Joint Expeditionary Force Experiment= Starting out in 1998 as the Air Force's [single service] Expeditionary Force eXperiment (EFX 98), this experimentation and testing venue allowed innovators and formal acquisition programs to try out new equipment, tactics, procedures in a large-scale field environment. The equipment tested included C3 systems, vehicles, aircraft, software, radios, etc. focused on enhancing information/ISR collection and exchange, and improving interoperability. The venue quickly grew to include multiple services and nations and was redesignated The Joint Expeditionary Force eXperiment by 1999 (JEFX 99). It was subsequently conducted biannually in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 with particular emphasis on C2 and improving the \\"Kill Chain\\". More recently, it was supposed to be downsized to focus on specific areas for improvement in C2 integration and conducted on a smaller scale on a quarterly basis with occasional large-scale events. =Tactical Networks Integration= Tactical Data Links and Voice Networks are essential to C2 and situational awareness of forces in the battlespace from the tactical edge to the Joint Task Force. AFC2IC has been leading the way in integrating these networks for the Air Force, other services, and other nations throughout its history including Link 11 and Link 16 improvements; TDL network management, integrators and gateways; Joint Tactical Radio System; and emerging developments in Airborne Networking.

Saint Sigiramnus (also Sigirannus and similar spellings; ; died 655 AD), also known as Saint Cyran, was an abbot and confessor of the 7th century. A nobleman of Berry,Alban Butler, The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Other Principal Saints (Published by Duffy, 1845), 71. he studied at Tours and then joined the royal court of Clothaire II. He served as cup- bearer but always wore a hair-shirt underneath his garments, devoting himself to prayer. His father, count of Bourges (and later bishop of Tours), wanted Sigiramnus to marry the daughter of a nobleman.Alban Butler, Kathleen Jones, David Hugh Farmer, Paul Burns, Butler's lives of the saints (Published by Liturgical Press, 2000), 41-2. Refusing to marry, Sigiramnus took holy orders at the church of St. Martin at Tours in 625 AD, serving as archdeacon at Tours. He refused to gain high position in the secular world, and after his father died, he gave away his goods and money to the poor; he was locked away as a lunatic for this. In 640, after he was released, he made a pilgrimage to Rome with Flavius, an Irish bishop. According to one account, as they crossed the diocese of Tours, he insisting on working in the fields with the serfs after he was ‚Äúseized with compassion at the peasants covered with dust and sweat.‚Äù When Sigiramnus returned to France, he founded two monasteries with land given to him by Clothaire in the diocese of Bourges: Saint-Pierre de Longoret (Longoretum, Lonrey) and M√©obecq (Millepecus), in the forest of Brenne region of the Berry province. Longoret was later renamed Saint-Michel- en-Brenne after him. He served as abbot of Longoret until his death in 655 AD.  Veneration  A life of Sigiramnus was written in the ninth or tenth centuries; the author of this Life claims to have compiled it from an earlier text. The monastery of Saint-Cyran was dissolved in 1712. Jean du Vergier de Hauranne (1581‚Äì1643), known as the Abb√© of Saint-Cyran, took his title from this monastery. Sigiramnus‚Äô relics were kept at the abbey of Saint-Cyran until 1860, when Eug√©nie de Montijo, Empress consort of the French, encased them in a reliquary and gave it to the church of Saint-Michel-en-Brenne.

The current bridge was completed in November 2005 and replaced the previous span built in 1929. History The Interstate Bridge was built in 1929 for $700,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to carry US 41 over the Menominee River at the state line. This bridge replaced a series of bridges built to connect Marinette, Wisconsin and Menominee, Michigan across the river. The first bridge was built in 1865 with a second built in 1872. A drawbridge was built in 1897 that connected the two communities farther upstream between downtown Marinette and Menominee's Frenchtown neighborhood near what is now 19th Street. The first Interstate Bridge replaced the previous bridges. It was built at an angle across the river, prompting one local resident to describe it as being \\"built up and down [the] river.\\" This bridge served as a vital connection between the two communities across the river. Residents of Menominee that worked in Marinette would drive as many as four times a day across the bridge in the 1930s and 1940s when families owned a single car. The Baby Boomer generation used the bridge as part of \\"cruising the loop\\". The 1929 bridge was in length, consisting of eleven spans. The construction used of dirt and of steel. Planning for the span took about five years to hammer out the details between the two states. Setbacks during construction included flooding of the coffer dams used in the building of the piers that supported the bridge. The bridge opened in December 1929, just months after the October 29 stock market crash. The dedication ceremony for the bridge was held on June 6, 1930, and included governors Walter J. Kohler, Sr. of Wisconsin and Fred W. Green of Michigan. The ribbon cutters included Princess Kenoke of the Menominee Tribe. The bridge was rehabilitated in 1970 in a project that included widening the deck and replacing the guard rails. Another construction project in 1999 repaired the Michigan side and the slough bridge portion of the Wisconsin side of the bridge; the project closed the bridge for six months. Reconstruction The Interstate Bridge was replaced on the existing foundations starting on November 1, 2004, in a joint project between the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) and the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT). The 13-month project was budgeted to cost $6.45 million (equivalent to $ in ). Demolition started in the center of the bridge, sawing the deck into pieces for disposal. Barges were positioned to catch concrete, preventing it from entering the river. Coffer dams were installed so the piers could be broken up and removed as well. This reconstruction was completed ahead of schedule, with the span reopening on November 22, 2005. The project completely replaced the bridge above the water line with wider traffic lanes, new bicycle lanes and wider sidewalks. Images of wild rice were sculpted into the concrete making up the bridge because \\"Menominee\\" in the local Menominee language means \\"wild rice\\". These sculptures were added in addition to the other decorative elements added to the new bridge including the railings and light poles. Construction of the Interstate Bridge coincided with a project to replace the span between Marinette and Stephenson Island, which was also built in 1929, and a refurbishment of US 41 through Marinette. The new Interstate Bridge was dedicated on December 3, 2005, in a ribbon-cutting ceremony that replicated the 1930 ceremony on the previous bridge. Guest speakers included the mayors of both cities, and the Wisconsin secretary of transportation. Catherine Anderson of Pembine, Wisconsin, served as a ribbon cutter while representatives of the local elementary schools held the ribbon. Anderson was a participant in the 1930 dedication ceremony and led the parade to the center of the bridge in a 1930 Ford.

He first appeared in the 18th season, Survivor: Tocantins in which he won the title of Sole Survivor and the grand prize. Thomas later appeared as a contestant in the 20th season Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains, finishing in tenth place. He returned to play for a third time on the 34th season: Survivor: Game Changers where he placed 16th. Early life Thomas was raised in Samson, Alabama, graduated from Troy University as a business marketing major, and currently resides in Mobile, Alabama. SurvivorTocantins= On May 17, 2009, it was revealed that he had been voted the winner of Survivor: Tocantins, having received all seven jury votes (cast by Brendan Synnott, Tyson Apostol, Sierra Reed, Debbie Beebe, Benjamin \\"Coach\\" Wade, Tamara \\"Taj\\" Johnson-George, and Erinn Lobdell), beating out corporate consultant and friend Stephen Fishbach. In addition to his million-dollar win, Thomas also won the $100,000 prize for Sprint Player of the Season, beating out fellow fan favorites Johnson-George and Reed. Thomas was the sixth person to win Survivor's million-dollar prize without ever having any votes cast against him at Tribal Council‚Äîpreceded by Tina Wesson (The Australian Outback), Ethan Zohn (Africa), Brian Heidik (Thailand), Sandra Diaz-Twine (Pearl Islands), and Tom Westman (Palau). He was also the second person to win the million-dollar prize as a result of a unanimous vote‚Äîpreceded by Earl Cole (Fiji), and the second consecutive person to win both the million dollars and the $100,000, preceded by Bob Crowley (Gabon). Thomas is the first player ever to win Sole Survivor by a unanimous vote while never receiving any votes against him during the entire game. The only other two Survivor castaways to accomplish this feat are John Cochran in Survivor: Caramoan and Jeremy Collins in Survivor: Cambodia. However, neither Cochran nor Collins won the $100,000 prize for Sprint Player of the Season (it had been discontinued by the time Collins won Sole Survivor), and Collins received votes against him which were nullified by a hidden immunity idol. Thomas also performed with distinction in the challenges. During the reward challenge in Episode Four, Thomas carried 220 pounds before dropping out, tying the record previously set by Pearl Islands contestant Rupert Boneham, who had also carried 220 pounds before dropping out. At the immunity challenge that followed, Thomas came close to single-handedly winning immunity for Jalapao‚Äîby catching four out of the five balls needed to win, although Timbira won the challenge in the end. (In the process, Thomas knocked out a tooth‚Äîwhich Jeff Probst saved and later gave to Thomas's mother at the reunion special.) Thomas also won more post-merge reward and immunity challenges than anyone else in his season, with three reward challenges (the first two and the last one) and three immunity challenges (the last three consecutive ones). Because Thomas won the game unanimously, without having had a single vote cast against him, was awarded the $100,000 player-of-the-season prize, and won more individual challenges than anyone else by a considerable margin, he has been said to have played the first \\"perfect game\\" in Survivor history. =Heroes vs. Villains= Thomas was chosen to participate in the 20th season of Survivor as a member of the Heroes tribe. While he was part of this tribe, he made side deals with Tom Westman and Colby Donaldson, even though he was also in the majority alliance along with Amanda Kimmel, Candice Woodcock, Cirie Fields, James Clement, and Rupert Boneham. Thomas also switched his vote at the Heroes' third tribal council, which resulted in the elimination of Fields, foiling his original alliance's plan to vote off Donaldson or Westman, who played his hidden immunity idol. Despite this betrayal, he maintained his place in the Heroes tribe, and stuck with the majority after voting off Westman, who was seen as a threat, and Clement, who was a liability due to his injury at the \\"Schmergen Brawl\\" challenge. After a string of losses, Thomas's tribe of Heroes rallied and went on to win the next few challenges, thus maintaining immunity until the merge. When the Heroes tribe won a reward challenge in Episode 7, they found a clue to a hidden immunity idol and agreed to find it as a tribe. Nevertheless, Thomas decided to look for the idol by himself. He found it, but he was intending to keep it to himself to further his individual interests. However, Kimmel noticed that Thomas had found it, so Thomas was forced to reveal his find to the tribe. After several men of the Villains tribe were voted out, Thomas and other members of the Heroes tribe assumed there must be an alliance of the Villains' women, whereas in fact the alliance orchestrating these votes consisted of Russell Hantz, Parvati Shallow, and Danielle DiLorenzo. Thomas came up with a plan to give his tribe's hidden immunity idol to Hantz to keep him from being eliminated by the \\"female alliance\\", thinking that, once the tribes merged, Hantz would side with the Heroes and together they would be able to vote out Parvati, the Villain they assumed was biggest threat. When the tribes merged, Hantz feigned allegiance to the Heroes, and Thomas and his tribemates still assumed that Hantz was on their side, even though Hantz had not used the idol the Heroes had given him to eliminate Shallow, and even though Villains tribe member Sandra Diaz-Twine, who was on the outs with the Villains tribe, told Rupert Boneham there was no female alliance and explained what was really going on. Boneham relayed this information to the Heroes and warned Thomas that he shouldn't be putting all of his trust into Hantz, but Thomas did not believe what Diaz-Twine had said. At the first post-merge tribal council, just as Diaz-Twine had warned, the Villains all stuck together. Parvati Shallow played her own idol to protect Diaz-Twine, and also played the idol Thomas had given to Hantz (which Hantz had given to Shallow), to protect Jerri Manthey, whom the Heroes had voted for. With the votes against Manthey negated by the immunity idol, since all five Villains had voted for Thomas, he was the one eliminated by a 5‚Äì0 vote. Thus he became the 11th person voted off, the first person to be eliminated after the merge, and the third member of the jury. As a result of his move, at the live reunion special, Thomas was awarded a trophy for the dumbest move in Survivor history. Thomas cast his jury vote for Diaz-Twine to win again along with Courtney Yates, and fellow Heroes tribemates, Amanda Kimmel, Candice Woodcock, Boneham and Colby Donaldson. This secured Diaz-Twine to win a second time by a 6-3-0 vote. =Game Changers= On February 8, 2017, Thomas was revealed to be a contestant on the 34th season of Survivor, entitled Survivor: Game Changers. Amongst all the players that won on their first try, Thomas is the first male winner to play three times. He started on the Nuku tribe which won the first two challenges. Thomas was the only original Nuku member to remain on Nuku after the tribal split. At Nuku, he took the tribe fishing in the ocean, but at one point, he left the tribe, went back to camp and tried to find the hidden immunity idol but was unsuccessful. He later formed a bond with Malcolm Freberg, to whom Thomas suggested that they vote out fellow Heroes vs. Villains castaway Sandra Diaz-Twine. On Day 11, Jeff Probst announced that only one tribe would win immunity and the other two tribes would go to Tribal Council. Tavua won immunity. Probst then said that both Mana and Nuku would go to Tribal Council together and vote out one person. At the Nuku camp, Thomas suggested that they vote out Tai Trang for being sneaky, but Diaz-Twine wanted Sierra Dawn Thomas out. During a chaotic Tribal Council, J.T. went to Brad Culpepper and told him that Sierra was the target and he should vote for Diaz- Twine. However, this plan backfired as Trang played his hidden immunity idol on Sierra and Mana's votes sent Freberg out of the game. After returning from camp, J.T. lied to his tribe about not telling Culpepper who their target was, to avoid the blame. The next day, J.T. searched for an idol and ultimately found it. Then after Nuku won the reward challenge, J.T., back at camp, grew annoyed with Michaela Bradshaw for eating a tablespoon of sugar with a couple drops of coffee. Diaz-Twine then ate all the sugar in order to intensify his and Bradshaw's feud. He blamed Bradshaw for the disappearance of the sugar, then when Nuku lost immunity, he talked to Aubry Bracco, Jeff Varner, and Diaz-Twine about getting Bradshaw out. However, Diaz-Twine and Bradshaw agreed to vote out J.T., leaving Varner as the swing vote. J.T. decided not to bring his idol to Tribal Council because he believed he was safe. Ultimately, Varner sided with Diaz-Twine and Bradshaw, and J.T. was blindsided in 16th place.

After retiring from swimming, she took up bowling upon the recommendation of her mother. She was coached by Yoshikazu Nishida. While in school, she captured three high school tournaments, including the 1993 17th All-Japan High School Championship. After graduating from high school, Itakura planned on working in the bowling business, starting off as an office lady at a bowling center. In 1997, at the age of 22 years, she gave up her job when she was selected as a member of the Japan national team. Between 1999 and 2000, Itakura competed in various professional and amateur tournaments. She competed in the NHK Cup Japan All-Star Championships. And, she became the first and only Japanese to win the AMF World Cup (2001). Itakura became a professional in 2003, becoming the first bowler to enter the JPBA under a waiver, based on her success as an amateur, thereby bypassing the qualifying stages (usually, a bowler has to qualify via a series of difficult tests, which for many bowlers takes multiple years before they are successful.) In 2011, Itakura-pro finished the JPBA season 24th in points (980), 19th in scoring average (206.21), and 24th in money with 784,000 yen.

Regarded as one of the best European poets of his time, Eileen Battersby considered him \\"the lyric equivalent of William Trevor\\" and a better poet \\"by far\\" than Raymond Carver. Gerard Smyth regarded him as \\"one of poetry's true champions and certainly its most prodigious archivist\\". His book on Seamus Heaney is regarded as the definitive biography of the Nobel laureate. Life and career Born on 1 January 1954 in Thurles, County Tipperary, O'Driscoll was the child of James O'Driscoll and Catherine Lahart, a salesman/horticulturist and a homemaker. He was educated by the Congregation of Christian Brothers and then studied Law at University College, Dublin1972‚Äì75. After completing his secondary education, at age sixteen (1970), O'Driscoll was offered a job at Ireland's Office of the Revenue Commissioners the internal revenue and customs service. Specializing in \\"death duties, stamp duties, and customs,\\" he was employed for over thirty years full-time. He lived in Naas, County Kildare, until his sudden death. In the 1970s and 80s, O'Driscoll held many part-time jobs and positions in association with his writing. He took a position as part-time editor of Tax Briefing, a technical journal produced in Ireland, as well as reviewing poetry for Hibernia, and The Crane Bag. He also served on the council of the Irish United Nations Association from 1975‚Äì80. After this, he married Julie O'Callaghan, a writer, in September 1985. O'Driscoll stayed in the revenue business for as long as he did due to the advice of a colleague, who told him, \\"If you ever leave your job, you will stop writing.\\" Thus, revenue became a sort of fall back option for him; a career that paid regularly and provided a pension. Whereas poetry was his art. Even so, in his memoir entitled, Sing for the Taxman, O'Driscoll states, \\"I have always regarded myself as a civil servant rather than a 'poet' or 'artist' ‚Äì words I would find embarrassing and presumptuous to ascribe to myself.\\" After thirty-eight years in Revenue, in early 2008, O'Driscoll was asked to write a poem marking the opening of the Revenue Museum in Dublin Castle, marking the first time his job and his art would intermingle. This poem, At The Revenue Museum, which was originally brought to life to be printed in a program for the opening ceremony, now hangs as an exhibit in the museum itself. O'Driscoll died suddenly at the age of 58 over the 2012 Christmas period. He was rushed to hospital after becoming ill but quickly succumbed to his fate. The arts world was shocked by his sudden demise. His wife, the poet Julie O'Callaghan, and siblings ‚Äì brothers Proinsias, Seamus, Declan, and sisters, Marie and Eithne ‚Äì survived him. President Michael D. Higgins noted that O'Driscoll was \\"held in the highest regard not only by all those associated with Irish and European poetry\\". Joe Duffy, with whom O'Driscoll had appeared on air on the very week of his death, called O'Driscoll a \\"generous, caring and witty man\\". Fellow writer Belinda McKeon said he was \\"a scholar, a gentleman, a character, a friend\\". English critic David Morley described him as a \\"fine poet and great critic\\". Irish PEN mourned his death. Literary Activities Prior to the publication of his own poems, O'Driscoll published widely in journals and other print publications as both an essayist and poetry reviewer, for which he was very widely known. The Times Literary Supplement called him \\"one of Ireland's most respected critics of poetry.\\" During this time he contributed upwards of two-hundred essays and reviews to various publications. O'Driscoll was published in Poetry, The London Magazine, Harvard Review, The Southern Review, Narrative Magazine, and Poetry Review, and was invited to give readings of his work in the Poetry Room in Harvard University, the Poetry International in London as well as the Hay- on-Wye and Cheltenham festivals of literature. O'Driscoll wrote nine books of poetry, three chapbooks, and two collections of essays and reviews. The majority of his works were characterised by the use of economic language and the recurring motifs of mortality and the fragility of everyday life. As he aged, O'Driscoll's works become more fluid and thoughtful as well as more frequent, and, according to some sources, like Alan Brownjohn of The Sunday Times for instance, even though he is younger than some of the poetic greats, \\"at best he is already their equal.\\" Originally published as a pamphlet his sonnet poem 'The Bottom Line' is considered his hallmark work.Tochgi Nobuaki , 'Dennis Driscoll among the poets' Journal of Irish Studies ,vol 26 2011 In 1987, he temporarily became a writer-in-residence at the National University of Ireland. He has also served as editor of Poetry Ireland Review as well as two textbook anthologies entitled The Bloodaxe Book of Poetry, and Quote Poet Unquote. O'Driscoll published a collection of literary criticism entitled Troubled Thoughts, Majestic Dreams, which contain a selection of his essays and reviews. A new collection of his essays, The Outnumbered Poet from Gallery Press was published in 2013. Stepping Stones: Interviews with Seamus Heaney, an acclaimed 500-page volume of his interviews with 1995 Nobel Prize in Literature recipient, Seamus Heaney, was published in 2008.

Denman- West, Children's Literature: A Guide to Information Sources. (Libraries Unlimited, 1998), 121. . Begun in the 1970s to generate interest in children's literature as an academic discipline and to provide a place for those studying children's literature to share ideas, the association sponsors an annual conference, two scholarly journals, and a series of awards. The association has also published a series of essays, Touchstones, attempting to establish a canon of children's literature. History In order to stimulate an interest in children's literature among humanities scholars, ChLA was formed in 1972 by Anne Devereaux Jordan, then teaching at Western Michigan University, and her colleague, Jon Stott. Later that year, Devereaux contacted Francelia Butler of the University of Connecticut, who had founded the journal Children's Literature in 1971, inviting her to combine her efforts with theirs. Butler, Jordan, and Stott all felt the need to bring scholars who were interested in children's literature together to \\"help raise the status of children's literature.\\" As Butler wrote in The New York Times in 1973, \\"To many humanists...in languages, philosophy, psychology, sociology, anthropology, or history, the most embarrassing literature to study is not about autoeroticism or cunnilingus. On such works scholars pride themselves on their broadmindedness. What truly embarrasses them is literature for their own children‚Äî'kiddy lit,' they call it.\\"Carol Gay, \\"ChLA: 1973-1983\\". Children's Literature Association. Retrieved 15 January 2019. On 20 August 1973, Jordan, Stott, Butler, Bennet Brockman, Glenn Sadler, and John Graham had a meeting to formally found the association, and unite the association and the journal (final board member, Rodney Morissett was unable to attend). As a result, the Children's Literature Association had its first conference the following March. The Board of Directors approved a constitution at this conference. Initially, the organization numbered 200; membership doubled the following year. Jordan served as the Executive Secretary and conference organizer of the organization until spring of 1976. The association's work quickly began to raise the profile of children's literature as its representatives were invited to speak at major events on education and children's literature. Marilyn Fain Apseloff became the organization's second president, succeeding Stott in 1979. That year, Apseloff represented ChLA at the First White House Conference on Library and Information Sciences where she spoke on the importance of literature for children. Her speech read, in part: ‚ÄúLibraries are crucial to meet our goals, to meet what should be the country's goals: a heightened awareness of children's literature so that we can make book lovers of children, and a determination to educate their parents to realize the importance of good books for children. Therefore, I urge you on behalf of children everywhere to keep their needs in the forefront of your deliberations: after all, our future is in their hands.‚Äù Touchstones In his 1978 presidential address, Stott asked the membership to establish a canon, \\"which would provide common texts for shared dialogue and curricula and presumably position the field within canonical strata of academic privilege\\".Anne H. Lundin, Constructing the Canon of Children‚Äôs Literature: Beyond Library Walls and Ivory Towers. (London: Routledge, 2004), 65. . By 1980, a committee whose responsibility it was to formulate this canon, which consisted of two English professors, two librarians from a public school and one librarian from a public library, presented a panel discussion on the issues surrounding the development of the canon. The committee members had a variety of different views on the structure of the canon, for example, whether the list should reflect \\"literary excellence and/or historic significance\\". The librarians in particular suggested popular titles, arguing that the association must listen to the opinions of child readers. Scholar Perry Nodelman responded to the panel in the following Children‚Äôs Literature Association Quarterly issue, describing the process as \\"an undemocratic but praiseworthy endeavor\\" where \\"some books are more important than others\\". He also explained how providing a rationale for the list was crucial.Lundin, 66. The final list was published in 1982‚Äì83 as a pamphlet and consisted of 63 titles. It met with a hostile reception, so a revised version was presented as a series of \\"touchstones\\" (inspired by Matthew Arnold's description of a work as a benchmark). Nodelman edited the revised project, entitled Touchstones, and defended this method in his introduction, explaining that teachers need a set of books to go to when teaching a course for the first time and these books are those \\"beside which we may place other children's books in order to make judgments about their excellence\\". He explains that \\"a touchstone has to be unconventional enough to draw attention to itself, to cause controversy, perhaps to encourage imitators.\\" He contends that the list is a way to \\"open discussion\\" about children‚Äôs literature. Each of the titles in the series includes a scholarly essay that aims to provide \\"a clearer, deeper sense of the best in children's books, and all the strength and joy to be drawn from them\\".Lundin, 67. The essays grapple with the question of why the particular work is canonical using a range of critical approaches: feminist criticism, reader-response criticism, archetypal studies, and rhetorical criticism, among others. The three volumes are divided by genre: fiction, fairy tales, fables, myths, legends, poetry, and picture books. The texts span a little over 100 years, beginning with Little Women (1869) and ending with The Borrowers Avenged (1982), with the majority in the twentieth century. Journals ChLA supports two peer-reviewed scholarly journals published by the Johns Hopkins University Press: =Children's Literature Association Quarterly= ChLA publishes the Children's Literature Association Quarterly four times a year.

History Jacques Lafleur had been the historical leader of the right-wing anti-independence Rally for Caledonia in the Republic (RPCR) since the party's creation in 1977. However, in 2005, Lafleur announced his intentions to step down in favour of Pierre Frogier, who represented New Caledonia's second constituency and was a close supporter of the President of the UMP in France, now-President Nicolas Sarkozy. Frogier was seen as Lafleur's chosen successor. However, he came back on this decision and ran against Frogier for the RPCR leadership at the party congress. Frogier defeated Lafleur by a large margin. In January 2006, Lafleur announced the creation of a new political newspaper in New Caledonia, the Bulletin d'Information. In the April 2006 edition of the paper, he announced the creation of a new party, which would take the original name of the RPCR, the Rally for Caledonia. He criticized the RPCR for being a \\"small Rally\\" as opposed to a \\"large Rally\\". Senator Simon Loueckhote soon joined the RPC. In the New Caledonia's first constituency, Lafleur's constituency, Lafleur was defeated by the first round of the 2007 French legislative election by a number of candidates, most notably the RPCR's Ga√´l Yanno. Yanno went on to win the seat in an easy runoff. With Lafleur's defeat, the RPC's only parliamentarian was the island's sole Senator, the anti-independence Kanak Simon Loueckhote. However, Loueckhote left the RPC in April 2008 to found his own party, the Movement for Diversity. In the 2009 election, the RPC obtained 4.46% and only one seat in the Congress of New Caledonia. Lafleur left his seat in the Congress in 2010 to Jean-Luc Regent. The former leader of the anti-independists and founder of the RPC died on 4 December 2010.

He is also a former member of the Arkansas State Senate who served as Minority Leader and chairman of the Energy Committee. Term-limited, he left the Senate in January 2013. A native and resident of Gravette in Benton County in northwestern Arkansas, Hendren formerly represented Senate District 9, a seat now held by Bruce Holland of Greenwood in Sebastian County. He is a former Democrat in the most Republican section of his state. In 2014, at the age of seventy-six, Hendren was elected once more to the Arkansas House of Representatives, this time in District 92 for the seat vacated by the term-limited Mary Lou Slinkard, a fellow Republican. He was unopposed in both the Republican primary and the general election. He is eligible to serve if elected every two years until January 2021. On May 18, 2010, Hendren was defeated in the Republican primary by U.S. Representative John Boozman of Arkansas's 3rd congressional district for his party's nomination for the U.S. Senate to oppose, successfully as it developed, the incumbent Democratic Senator Blanche Lincoln. Education and family In 1960, Hendren graduated with a degree in engineering from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. He is an Independent Protestant who has been active since 1963 in the Gideons International, the men's group which distributes Bibles in such public places as hotel rooms. He is active in Kiwanis International. Hendren is married to the former Marylea Hutchinson, a sister of former U.S. Senator Tim Hutchinson and former U.S. Representative, former head of the DEA, and current Governor Asa Hutchinson. In 2002, Tim Hutchinson lost his reelection bid to Mark Pryor for the other U.S. Senate seat from Arkansas. Asa Hutchinson lost a Senate race in 1986 to Dale Bumpers and the gubernatorial campaign in 2006 to Mike Beebe. Hendren is an engineer and holds investments in an automobile dealership, real estate, and poultry interests. The Hendrens have four children, Mark, Jim, Gayla Joy Hendren McKenzie, and Kimberly Hope Duke. Jim Hendren is the current Republican state senator for District 2 in Benton County, the Senate Majority Leader, and a former member of the Arkansas House. Like his father, he has hence served in both houses of the Arkansas General Assembly. Daughter Gayla owns the radio station KBVA which has carried political advertising for her father's campaigns. Legislative service Known for his folksy demeanor at the Arkansas State Capitol, Hendren considers himself a fiscal conservative and voted against changing the Arkansas unemployment law to accept $59 million in federal stimulus money. He voted in February 2009 to support an increase in his state's tobacco tax. In 2008, he backed an increase in the severance tax on natural gas. He has also authored a bill to require motorcyclists to wear helmets or demonstrate proof of health insurance. From 1967 to 1969, Hendren served on the Gravette City Council and later the Gravette School Board. In 1978, he was first elected as a Democrat to the state Senate at the same time that his later gubernatorial opponent, Bill Clinton won his first two-year term as governor.Arkansas Gazette, Little Rock, Arkansas, November 9, 1978. Hendren won the Senate seat in 1978, after the incumbent Republican, Jim R. Caldwell, a Church of Christ minister then from Rogers, stepped down after a decade in office. During that time, Caldwell was the only Republican serving in the Arkansas Senate.Arkansas Outlook, Republican Party newsletter, November‚ÄìDecember 1968. In 1982, Hendren ran fourth in a five-candidate field, with 21,829 votes (3.85 percent), in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. After defeating Joe Purcell in a runoff, former Governor Clinton that year then toppled Republican Frank D. White, who had unseated Clinton in the Ronald W. Reagan sweep of 1980.Arkansas Secretary of State, Democratic gubernatorial primary election returns from 1982 Because Hendren ran for governor, he could not seek reelection to the state Senate that year. In 2001, he returned to the legislature, having won a single term in 2000 ‚Äî his first as a Republican‚Äîin the Arkansas House of Representatives. In 2003, he returned to the state Senate twenty years after he left the position. He ran unopposed for a four- year term in 2008. In early 2017, Representative Hendren drafted a bill to prohibit Howard Zinn books in Arkansas public schools. Zinn was a historian, playwright, and social activist known for his A People's History of the United States. Hendren worded House Bill 1834: For An Act To Be Entitled: \\"AN ACT TO PROHIBIT A PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT OR OPEN-ENROLLMENT PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL FROM INCLUDING IN ITS CURRICULUM OR COURSE MATERIALS FOR A PROGRAM OF STUDY BOOKS OR ANY OTHER MATERIAL AUTHORED BY OR CONCERNING HOWARD ZINN; AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.\\" U.S. Senate candidacy In May 2009, Hendren apologized after it was reported that during a meeting of the Pulaski County Republican Committee in Little Rock, he referred to Democratic U.S. Senator Charles Schumer of New York as \\"that Jew\\" after Schumer had criticized the Republican Party. \\"I ought not to have referred to it at all. When I referred to him as Jewish, it wasn't because I don't like Jewish people. I shouldn't have gotten into this Jewish business because it distracts from the issue... I believe in traditional values, like we used to see on The Andy Griffith Show,\\" Hendren said, adding that he does not use a teleprompter and sometimes misspeaks in haste. Schumer said that he accepted the apology. Hendren's comments drew a reprimand from Brian Walsh, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, who said that \\"Comments like this are completely inappropriate and don't have any place in public or private discourse.\\" Hendren opposed the confirmation of United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. He also objects to the federal government spending more than it takes in while individual states are required to balance their budgets. He opposed Senator Lincoln's vote to subsidize the giant AIG insurance company. Hendren said that he favors strict enforcement of immigration laws but would \\"have to look at\\" potential amnesty for illegal immigrants already living in the United States. He opposed charging only the in-state college tuition, rather than out-of- state, for children of illegal immigrants living in Arkansas. Hendren was the first Republican to enter the 2010 Senate contest but finished far behind his primary rivals and could not simultaneously run again for the state Senate.

His father was a doctor in Cincinnati, Ohio who had emigrated to the United States from Ireland in 1868.Cincinnati, the Queen City, 1788‚Äì1912, Volume 3 By Charles Frederic Goss, Clarke, S. J., Publishing Company, S.J. Clarke Publishing Company Graydon's father later became a prominent Republican politician and manufacturer of patent medicines.The New York Times Published: March 1, 1900 Graydon was educated in the private schools of Cincinnati and at St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, from which he graduated in 1899. All- American at Harvard In the fall of 1899, Graydon entered Harvard University. He played fullback on the Harvard football team in 1900, 1901 and 1902. He was selected by Walter Camp as an All-American at that position in 1901 and 1902. His brother, Joseph Graydon, played end for Harvard. In February 1902, Graydon gained publicity for his participation in a charity performance with the Barnum & Bailey Circus. Some Harvard athletes engaged in a burlesque polo match, and Graydon engaged in a tumbling routine while dressed \\"in resplendent pink tights.\\" Marriage and professional life Graydon married Helen Beryl Whitney, the daughter of San Francisco millionaire, J. Parker Whitney. The two became engaged when Whitney was between thirteen and fifteen years old and eloped in 1903. Their \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" romance, in which Graydon helped his bride escape from a New York boarding school, garnered national media attention. One Boston newspaper reported: > The young couple have known each other very well for years. The groom was a > roommate of the bride's brother at Harvard; and the blonde fullback whose > plays on the gridirons at Cambridge and New Haven were acclaimed by > thousands of admirers, has long been known to the Whitneys as 'Tommy' ... > She was about the age of 15 when she met and fell in love with 'Tommy' > Graydon ... It was impossible from the first day for any observer not to see > they were desperately in love with each other. After the completion of his education, published accounts differ as to Graydon's professional career. According to contemporaneous press accounts, Graydon trained as a cobbler in Cincinnati after graduating from Harvard‚Äîhoping to learn the shoe business. He later became manager for a shoe company. According to a later-published social history of Cincinnati, Graydon returned to Cincinnati after graduating from Harvard, where he accepted a position in the bookkeeping department of The Macdonald-Kiley Company. The latter publication states that Graydon was appointed as a vice president of the company after three years and as president of the company at age 28 in 1909. Under Graydon's leadership, the latter publication states that the company employed 200 men and 50 women and sold goods throughout the United States. In 1909, the couple garnered national press attention again when Mrs. Gradyon sued for divorce, alleging that her husband failed to support her. One press account of the trial reported on the testimony of Graydon's wife and father-in-law: > Idleness, dissipation and neglect on the part of Graydon entered into her > disillusionment, she explained, and he had allowed his business in > Cincinnati to dwindle away until it did not bring enough revenue to provide > for her support, she said.

On April 6, 1910 a decree of divorce was granted.The New York Times Published: April 7, 1910 Military service When the United States entered World War I, Graydon enlisted and was sent to the Plattsburg training camp. After training he was commissioned captain of the 303rd Machine Gun Company, and was sent to Camp Devens. Graydon left for France on July 4, 1917, with the 76th Division. Later he was transferred to the 3rd Division and was placed in command of Company B of the Seventh Machine Gun battalion. He saw action at the Battle of Ch√¢teau-Thierry where his machine gun battalion bore the brunt of the fighting. After the Armistice was signed he became part of the army of occupation and was the first Harvard man to reach the Rhine. He returned to the United States on April 8, 1919 and received his honorable discharge. Later years Graydon was married three times. His second wife was Mary Andrews, and his third wife was Marian MacAdams of New York City. Graydon was married to his third wife for 20 years starting in 1929. Graydon was affiliated with the Episcopal church, the Business Men's Club, Harvard Club and Phi Delta Psi fraternity, which he joined while in college.

Confirmation in the Lutheran Church is a public profession of faith prepared for by long and careful instruction. In English, it is called \\"affirmation of baptism\\", and is a mature and public reaffirmation of the faith which \\"marks the completion of the congregation's program of confirmation ministry\\".Lutheran Book of Worship - Ministers Desk Edition, p.324  Scriptural background  Lutherans, like Roman Catholics, believe that Confirmation is based on Biblical precedents such as Acts of the Apostles 8:14-17: > Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word > of God, they sent them Peter and John, who went down and prayed for them, > that they might receive the Holy Spirit, for it had not yet fallen upon any > of them; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then > they laid hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.  Description  An Explanation of Luther's Small Catechism states: > Confirmation is a public rite of the Church preceded by a period of > instruction designed to help baptized Christians identify with the life and > mission of the Christian community. Note: Prior to admission to the > Eucharist, it is necessary to be instructed in the Christian faith (1 Cor. > 11:28). The rite of confirmation provides an opportunity for the individual > Christian, relying on God's promise given in Holy Baptism, to make a > personal public confession of the faith and a lifelong pledge of fidelity to > Christ.An Explanation of Luther's Small Catechism, copyright 1991, Concordia > Publishing House, question 306, page 241 (LCMS)  Rite  A Lutheran confirmation service, Temppeliaukio Church, Helsinki. The Rite of Confirmation provides an opportunity for the individual Christian, relying on God's promise given in Baptism, to make a personal public profession of the faith and a lifelong pledge of faithfulness to Christ. Confirmation teaches baptized Christians who wish to become Lutheran Martin Luther's theology on the Ten Commandments, the Apostles' Creed, the Lord's Prayer, Baptism, Confession, and the Eucharist. Similar to the Roman Catholic tradition, some Lutheran congregations instruct the very young (such as age 7) in understanding the Eucharist and then receive First Communion before beginning the Confirmation process several years later. (Other Lutheran congregations confirm children at about the 5th grade, or the 8th grade, if they are of the LCMS Lutheran synod, after which they make their first Holy Communion.) At the conclusion of this catechetical instruction, young persons traditionally make a public profession of their faith in a public ceremony. Students often begin taking catechism classes at about age twelve and are usually confirmed at age fourteen. Some Lutheran pastors and theologians are now beginning to ask whether it is permissible to adopt the practice of the Eastern church and to confirm/chrismate at baptism, including infants. Lutherans do not accept the belief that only a bishop can confirm, as is the custom in the Anglican tradition. Even in countries where Lutherans claim to retain apostolic succession, such as Estonia, Sweden, Finland and Norway etc., a priest is allowed to confirm.

The original building was erected in 1864, and was used for 37 years until condemned in 1911. The edifice, built in the same location in 1917, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987, and is also a contributing property in the Downtown Woodland Historic District. History The land for the first courthouse was offered to the county supervisors by Frank Freeman, one of Woodland's founders. He offered an entire city block with the boundaries of Court, North, Second, and Third Streets. Albert Bennett, an architect from Sacramento, who also worked among other architects on the California State Capitol building, was hired by the Yolo County Board of Supervisors to design one of the city's first major landmarks. A builder named P. McManus was chosen for the construction and was hired on June 26, 1863, for $24,250, and was to have it built by October 1, 1864. The final result was a two-story brick Italianate style edifice, $27,858 in the making. Not only was the dollar amount more than what was expected, but the construction also took longer than planned. Subsequent earthquakes in 1892, 1904, and 1906 weakened the structural integrity of the building and damaged the ventilation system. In 1908 one judge moved his court out of the building due to odor in the building. The Yolo County Grand Jury, Board of Supervisors, and the California State Board of Health found the building \\"unsanitary and unfit for the transactions of the court\\" on January 4, 1911. On October 17, 1911 the supervisors held a county-wide election to approve a $300,000 bond measure that would pay for the new courthouse to be built. The measure lacked the consensus needed, and it was put up again in the next election on December 28, 1911, failing another time. In the meantime, the court moved its offices. In 1916 the Board of Supervisors placed another measure on the ballot for $200,000. The citizens passed the measure and the old courthouse was demolished to make room for the construction of a new building. A ceremony was held with a crowd of 3,000, and the Grand Lodge of Masons of California laid the cornerstone of the new courthouse. All businesses and schools were closed for the celebration. William Henry Weeks, who completed several works in Woodland including the Woodland Public Library, was the architect and Robert Trost, from San Francisco, was the contractor. It is an example of the Beaux- Arts architecture style. The building was completed in 1917 and the price totaled $300,000. The courthouse was extensively remodeled on the interior during the 1980s and placed on the National Register of Historic Places near the end of 1986. The courthouse originally held other county administrative offices, but as the courts have grown, those have been relocated. Today it is still in use as a courthouse, but has exceeded its space limits and is currently looking for another site to locate to. Architecture left The new building's architecture displays influences of Greek, Roman, and Renaissance architecture. It features two full stories, as well as an attic and a basement. The concrete exterior was made of Colusa sandstone, and the cornices were made with material from a terra cotta factory in Lincoln, California. When Weeks showed visitors around the new courthouse he was quoted as saying, \\"This courthouse is the most beautiful in California, and I have built and rebuilt many of them and have seen them all...\\" On the inside, the courthouse has a rotunda on both the second and third floors with a main corridor spanning the length of the building. Each rotunda is made of marble pilaster columns with decorative murals in niches located near them. Both the rotundas and corridors are made from cut and polished marble with decorative copper handrails and hand-blown, egg-shaped glass light fixtures.

Such city formation involves some irreversible spatial investments, massive resource allocations and financial investments recoverable only if anticipated future income transpires. Consequently, it is a pertinent concept in urban planning. Though related, this is not to be confused with urban economics where economic principles and tools are applied at macro and micro levels. Urbanomics is to be understood as a paradigm to understand impact of the globalization process on urban development.Friedmann J. & Wolff, G.

Reference to social theory assumes the indivisibility of political, social and economic forces. Sustainability is increasingly becoming the lynch-pin of urban studies with triple-line accountability (social, environment and economics) given more emphasis though not necessarily translated to practice. Here, urbanomics, by default, renders environmental and social concerns to subservience. Urban theory Theoretical discourse has often polarized between economic determinismMarx, K.

(1996) Telecommunications and the City: Electronic Spaces, Urban Places, London: Routledge Regardless of the deterministic stance (economic, cultural or technological), in the context of globalization, there is a mandate to mold the city to complement the global economic structure and urbanomics gains ascendancy. Globalization and economic capital The notion of urban‚Äô is derived from ‚Äòurbs‚Äô which refers to the built city and ‚Äòcivitas‚Äô which refers to feelings, rituals, and convictions that define urban life.Sennett, R. 1990 The Conscience of the Eye, the Design and Social Life of Cities, London: Norton & Company It connotes a dialectic relationship between materialism and ideas. This can be related to the ‚Äòsense of place‚Äô that Bourdieu refers to as ‚Äòhabitus‚Äô. He makes reference to symbolic capital ‚Äì an appropriation of how things should be; that can be individualistic or collectively expressed. This concept has been well received in urban theory.Bounds, M. (2004) Urban Social Theory: City Self and Society, New York: Oxford University Press [Stated with immense oversimplification,] architects focus on symbolism, engineers on quality standards, urban planners on land use and zoning and landscape artists on aesthetics, environmentalists on depletion of natural resources and climatic consequences, social-cause groups on the economically marginalized and residents on saving suburbs from the degradation of neighborhood character. Symbolism has many facets but its cumulative capital does not provide a convincing wealth generation (economic capital) model as an alternative to prosper the city. Economic sustainability In fact, urbanomics can spillover beyond the city parameters. The process of globalization extends its territories into global city regions. Essentially, they are territorial platforms (metropolitan extensions from key cities, chain of cities linked within a state territory or across inter-state boundaries and arguably; networked cities and/or regions cutting across national boundaries) interconnected in the globalized economy. Some see global city-regions rather than global cities as the nodes of a global network.Scott, A. J. (ed.) (2001) Global City-Regions, Oxford: Oxford University Press Sennett, R. 1990 The Conscience of the Eye, the Design and Social Life of Cities, London: Norton & Company The rules of engagement are built on economic sustainability ‚Äì the ability to continuously generate wealth. The cornerstones of this economic framework are the following ‚Äò4C‚Äô attributes: (1) currency flow for trading, (2) commoditization of products and services in supply chain management, (3) command centre function in orchestrating interdependency and monitoring executions and (4) consumerization. Unless, decoupling the economy from these attributes can be demonstrated; symbolic capital expressions as legitimate as they may be; must accept the domineering status of urbanomics. Revisiting economic measurements Arguably, the culprit of this economic entrapment is the high consumption lifestyle synonymous with affluence. The resolve may well be that ‚Äòless is more‚Äô and that true welfare lies not in a rise in production and income. As such, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is increasingly being questioned as inaccurate and inadequate. GDP includes things that do not contribute to sustainable growth and excludes non-monetary benefits that improve the welfare of the people. In response, alternative measures have been proposed such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)Talberth, J. Cobb, C. & Slattery, N.

Lovitt, owner of a fleet of ships from Yarmouth, began as the sole owner. The ship enjoyed a profitable decade of service circling the globe several times but most often trading between South American, Canadian and British ports. She survived a serious grounding at Low Point, Cape Breton in 1893. After being dismasted in December 1895, she was to be broken up at Grimsby, England but was purchased by the government of Argentina as a school ship.

The world had changed, particularly the world of money, and the Prince of Monaco, Louis II, believed the casino's aged owner, Camille Blanc, had lost touch. As the casino supplied the principality with revenue, he sought to replace Blanc and bring in fresh business management. For assistance, he approached Basil Zaharoff, an international financier and arms dealer who had long been a patron of the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur. Zaharoff managed to get hold of the shares and, with the aid of the Prince, shouldered Blanc out and became the casino's master. Zaharoff brought in fresh administration and the result paid huge dividends.John Flynn: Men of Wealth - the Story of Twelve Significant Fortunes from the Renaissance to the Present Day, 337‚Äì372 =Aristotle Onassis= In 1953, Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis bought up the shares of SBM via the use of front companies in the tax haven of Panama and took control of the organisation, moving his headquarters into the Old Sporting Club on Monaco's Avenue d'Ostende shortly after. Onassis's takeover of the SBM was initially welcomed by Monaco's ruler, Prince Rainier III, as the country required investment, but Onassis and Rainier's relationship had deteriorated by 1962 in the wake of the boycott of Monaco by the French president, Charles de Gaulle. Onassis and Rainier had differing visions for Monaco. Onassis wished the country to remain a resort for an exclusive clientele, but Rainier wished to build hotels and attract a greater number of tourists.\\"Obituary: Prince Rainier III of Monaco.\\", The Times, London, 7 April 2005, pg. 58.

Unwilling to give Onassis his guarantee, Rainier used his veto to cancel the entire hotel project, and publicly attacked SBM for their ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô on television, implicitly criticising Onassis. Rainier and Onassis remained at odds over the direction of the company for several years, and, in June 1966, Rainier approved a plan to create 600,000 new shares in SBM to be permanently held by the state,\\"Mr. Onassis In Monaco Law Battle.\\", The Times, London, 22 August 1966, pg. 6. which reduced Onassis's stake from 52% to under a third. In the Supreme Court of Monaco, the share creation was challenged by Onassis who claimed that it was unconstitutional, but the court found against him in March 1967. Following the ruling, Onassis sold his holdings in SBM to the state of Monaco for US$9.5 million ($ as of 2015), and left the country.

The pneumatically actuated inwards retracting undercarriage was housed inside the inner lower-wing which folded at approx ¬Ω span to lie in recesses in the sides of the fuselage. The outer halves of the lower wings remained horizontal as the wings retracted and were housed in recesses in the under-surfaces of the upper wings. Retraction of the wings was carried out by a single vertically mounted pneumatic actuator in the fuselage which unlocked the bracing struts either side and pulled the wing upwards as the bracing strut was pulled upwards. Control of the undercarriage retraction and wing folding was accomplished with a single three position lever in the cockpit. With 'Chassis Down' selected the wing and undercarriage were extended, selecting 'Chassis Up/Wing Down' retracted the undercarriage into the inner lower wing, and selecting 'Wing Up' retracted the wing, selection of wing position could be made at any time to enable the pilot to choose the best configuration for the situation the aircraft was in.\\"The Annals Of The Polymorth ‚Äì A short history of V-G\\", Air International/March 1972, page 139-140 Flight tests were successful but the performance of the monoplane configuration was inferior to the contemporary monoplane fighters such as the MiG-3 and Yak-1 .

Background Although he was a son of Man o' War, Clyde Van Dusen had an unimpressive appearance, being described as \\"a mere pony of a horse with a weedy frame.\\" Owner/breeder Herbert Gardner, an Amsterdam, New York businessman, named the horse after his trainer, former jockey Clyde Van Dusen. Van Dusen said, \\"Clyde is a little horse, and that is why Mr. Gardner named him after me.\\" Racing career Clyde Van Dusen had a successful two-year-old season, winning the Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes, Orphanage Stakes, Valley Stakes, and Idle Hour Stakes. As a three-year-old, he lost a Kentucky Derby prep race to the Derby favorite and eventual Horse of the Year, Blue Larkspur, and he drew the #20 post position on Derby Day. Only Blue Larkspur was outside of him in the farthest post position, #21. His jockey, Linus McAtee, was startled by the horse's appearance and admitted to being \\"kind of scared\\" before the race. However, the race was run in a downpour, and unlike Blue Larkspur, Clyde Van Dusen was wearing mud caulks on the sloppy track. As a result, he was never seriously threatened and won by 2 lengths, although his time of 2:10 4/5 was one of the slowest winning times in Derby history. After the race, Blue Larkspur's owner, Colonel Edward R. Bradley, called Clyde Van Dusen \\"the worst horse to win the Derby in twenty years.\\" Clyde Van Dusen was the seventh gelding to win the Kentucky Derby in the race's first 55 runnings. It was 74 years before another gelding (Funny Cide) won the race. After winning the Derby, Clyde Van Dusen finished in the money in several stakes, but he never won another major race. He retired in 1933 with a career record of 12 wins in 42 starts and $122,402 in earnings. Retirement Following the horse's retirement, trainer Van Dusen acquired him and used him as an exercise pony.

It therefore seems that d'Ivry and D'Oyly held the manor in chief between them. By 1127 D'Oyly's share of Worton had passed to the church of St. George in Oxford Castle. After 1536 in the Dissolution of the Monasteries it passed first to Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford and then in 1546 to Christ Church college. Christ Church sold its land at Worton in the 1950s. D'Ivry's share became part of the honour of Saint Valery. This share of Worton belonged to one of the Counts of Dreux early in the 12th century, passing to Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall in 1237. Richard's son Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall died childless in 1300 and there is no record of the overlordship of this half of Worton Manor after 1324.

They occur naturally when applying an orthonormal basis of functions on the unit sphere that transform in a particular way under rotations in three dimensions. Such integrals are particularly useful when computing properties of atoms which have natural spherical symmetry. These integrals are defined below along with some of their mathematical properties. Formulation In connection with the quantum theory of atomic structure, John C. Slater defined the integral of three spherical harmonics as a coefficient c.John C. Slater, Quantum Theory of Atomic Structure, McGraw-Hill (New York, 1960), Volume I These coefficients are essentially the product of two Wigner 3jm symbols. :c^k(\\\\ell,m,\\\\ell',m')=\\\\int d^2\\\\Omega \\\\ Y_\\\\ell^m(\\\\Omega)^* Y_{\\\\ell'}^{m'}(\\\\Omega) Y_k^{m-m'}(\\\\Omega) These integrals are useful and necessary when doing atomic calculations of the Hartree‚ÄìFock variety where matrix elements of the Coulomb operator and Exchange operator are needed. For an explicit formula, one can use Gaunt's formula for associated Legendre polynomials. Note that the product of two spherical harmonics can be written in terms of these coefficients. By expanding such a product over a spherical harmonic basis with the same order : Y_\\\\ell^m Y_{\\\\ell'}^{m'} = \\\\sum_{\\\\ell} \\\\hat{A}^{\\\\ell}(\\\\ell,m,\\\\ell',m',) Y_{\\\\ell}^{m+m'}, one may then multiply by Y^* and integrate, using the conjugate property and being careful with phases and normalisations: : \\\\int Y_\\\\ell^m Y_{\\\\ell'}^{m'} Y_{L}^{-M} d^2\\\\Omega = (-1)^{m+m'}\\\\hat{A}^{L}(\\\\ell,m,\\\\ell',m') = (-1)^{m}c^L(\\\\ell,-m,\\\\ell',m'). Hence : Y_\\\\ell^m Y_{\\\\ell'}^{m'} = \\\\sum_{\\\\ell}(-1)^{m'} c^{\\\\ell}(\\\\ell,-m,\\\\ell',m',) Y_{\\\\ell}^{m+m'}, These coefficient obey a number of identities.

From 1980‚Äì81, Zafar-ul-Haq served as a member on the Panel of Experts for Pakistan Law Commission under the Ministry of Law and Justice. In 1981, he joined the Zia administration as the Information Minister and the Minister of Religious Affairs which served until 1985. In 1985, President Zia-ul-Haq appointed him as the Pakistan Ambassador to Egypt which he tenured until 1986 when he was appointed as an adviser to Zia administration. He advised Prime Minister Mohammad Junejo on political and legal matters until 1987, and sided to join the Pakistan Muslim League (N) led by its President Fida Mohammad. In 1990‚Äì91, Zafar-ul-Haq presented Pakistan in the International Law Commission of the United Nations and was elected as Pakistan Senator for the first time in 1991 for a six-year term. In 1992, he was appointed in the Board of Trustees (BoT) of International Islamic University in Islamabad until 1997.Senate, Pakistan During this time, he was appointed as the Secretary-General of the World Muslim Congress until 1997. In 1997, he participated in the nationwide general elections on a Rawalpindi constituency which he successfully defended, and joined the second administration of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif as the Minister of Religious Affairs. He played a crucial and vital role in drafting the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan to declare the \\"Islam as the Supreme Law\\"‚Äî the amendment was passed with the two-thirds majority in the National Assembly (lower house) but failed to be passed in the Senate (Upper house) in 1999. Over the Kargil conflict in 1999, he reportedly warned the BJP ministry in India of \\"Pakistan resorting to the nuclear weapons issue if the country's territorial integrity, security and sovereignty is harmed. Though, his statement was not taken as serious as he was not involved in the national security matters at that time, and was seen as a political statement which he stated during the meeting with his constituents. In 2000, Zafar-ul- Haq was elected as the Chairman of the Pakistan Muslim League (N), which he is currently serving, whilst Javed Hashmi becoming the President of Pakistan Muslim League (N). On 4 December 2001, Zafar-ul-Haq appealed to the religious and conservative mass to call for the massive public demonstration against the Pervez Musharraf, leading the pro-democracy movement with Amin Fahim to restore the civilian control. In 2009 he was elected to the Pakistani Senate for a six-year term. He was elected as the leader of the Independent Opposition Group (consisting of more than 6 parliamentary parties) in the Senate of Pakistan in 2009. On 15 February 2018, PML(N) announced to appoint Zafar-ul-Haq for the Chairman Senate for the senate elections that were scheduled in 12 March 2018. Despite the PML(N) successfully retained the majority in the Senate, Zafar-ul-Haq's bid for the chairmanship was fell short through the number countings and, was defeated by independent Sadiq Sanjrani, who had support from the Asif Zardari and Imran Khan in spite of their disagreement. Upon hearing the news of the number manipulation in the Senate elections, PML(N)'s leadership and the Prime Minister Shahid Abbasi reacted very negatively, and reportedly quoted in the news media that \\"Sanjrani holds no respect\\", and calls were made for the reelection of the Senate elections. On 24 August 2018, he was appointed leader of the opposition in the Senate. =Political positions and views= His views reflected the religious conservatism but has strongly voice for the religious sanity and the interfaith dialogue among the three Abrahamic religions‚Äì Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In his public speaking at the conservative conventions in the country, Zafar-ul-Haq has strongly stressed and argued for the religious temperance. In 2005, Zafar-ul-Haq demanded the inquiry commission on kargil debacle to be investigated by the Supreme Court of Pakistan to point and recommend the punishment for those involved. After his removal from the Minister of Religious Affairs in 1999 due to the military takeover in 1999, Zafar-ul-Haq viewed very negatively of the performance of the Musharraf administration, which he believed was working towards weakening the state on a deliberate international agenda. In an interview in 2012, Zafar-ul-Haq held President Musharraf responsible of promoting religious intolerance in the country by introducing legislative reforms reflecting against the teachings of Islam without the consent of the public. He also accused Musharraf of starting the starting the armed conflict to harm the Kashmir cause, and raised his voice for civilian control of the military. Though, he has repeatedly spoke very high of Nawaz Sharif's services done to the country and Islam, he remained unsympathetic to suicide attacks being taken placed on Pervez Musharraf. In 2011, he was quoted as saying that Islam is the prime source behind the uprising movements in the Middle East and North Africa. His statement came in response to the European intervention in Libya in favor of the Libyan Opposition.

It was founded in 1965 through the union of the Council for the Affairs of the Russian Orthodox Church (CAROC) and the Council for the Affairs of Religious Cults.Ro'i 2000, 12. It ceased to exist after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Background The operations of the Council for Religious Affairs (CRA) became more apparent to scholars outside of the Soviet Union following glasnost and an opening of the Soviet archives. The CRA was a result of a renewed assault against religion, which started under the Khrushchev era, even though the CRA was not created until after his deposition. Letters from individual parishes express their frustration and alarm at a wave of new attacks starting in 1959, before the CRA was formed. Concerns came from both non-Orthodox and Orthodox figures, including Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow. The first head of the CRA, Vladimir A. Kuroyedov, was in fact the final head of the Council for the Affairs of the Russian Orthodox Church. He replaced Chairman Karpov and was seen as a much more anti-religious enthusiast who did not have reservations about attacking established religion. In the period of 1958-1964, when the CRA was officially created, Kuroyedov oversaw the dissolution of over 1,000 places of worship for non-Orthodox religious denominations, and over 6,000 Orthodox churches. Structure The CRA statute organizes the council as being attached to the USSR Council of Ministers, but the Chairman of the CRA did not have ministerial rank. The chairman oversaw different divisions, which focused on particular religious groups, e.g. the Russian Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, Islam, Judaism, etc. The CRA has been described as a go-between for religious denominations and the Soviet state. It was tasked with overseeing execution of legislation pertaining to religious \\"cults.\\" Officially, the CRA had \\"no part to play\\" in promoting atheism or serving as the means for the party's anti-religious campaigns; however, one author found during the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the archives were generally more open than before, that there is evidence to the contrary. He cites an example of the CRA joining with another state agency, The Institute of Scientific Atheism, in combating the resurgence of Ukrainian Catholic activists. Activities The CRA adopted & continued many of the activities of its predecessors. For example, By the 1960s, the CAROC had already been interfering in the administration of the Russian Orthodox Church, appointing priests and forbidding them from managing their own parishes. According to one source, archives show that the over 20 years of CRA activity show a vast interference in religious affairs, while not having the statutory authority to do so. Through these operations of the CRA, the Soviets were able to install clergymen who were compliant to the Soviet message and authority. Similar attempts were conducted in Baptist and Catholic parishes, with CRA authorities looking to impose \\"tame bishops\\" on the church. While the Holy See had the sole authority to appoint bishops, the CRA was Soviet Anti-Catholic Campaigns actively engaged in the creation of national churches to sequester local Catholic churches from the mother church in Rome. In 1980, the CRA teamed with official media outlets, such as the Novosti press agency to \\"unmask the reactionary content of the political and social conceptions of the Vatican, papal encyclical and other programmatic Vatican documents with the subsequent aim of distributing these materials among the Soviet and foreign mass media. The CRA added a Catholic Department following the election of John Paul II to deal specifically with the \\"Catholic Question\\".  Archival sources  The archives of the CRA are now available in the State Archive of the Russian Federation in Moscow (collection number –†-6991, inventory # 6The russian archival code is –§–æ–Ω–¥ –†-6991, –æ–ø–∏—Å—å 6), the titles of the archival files are searchable through the online database.SA RF Official web site Heads * Vladimir Kuroyedov (1960‚Äî1984) * Konstantin Kharchev (1984‚Äî1989) * Yuri Khristoradnov (1989-1991) NotesReferences  * See also * Society of the Godless * USSR anti-religious campaign (1970s‚Äì1990) * Soviet anti-religious legislation * State Administration for Religious Affairs (People's Republic of China) Category:Religion in the Soviet Union ","title":"Council for Religious Affairs"},{"id":"22843372","text":"is a Japanese female professional ten-pin bowler.

Migration history A few Chinese settled in Czechoslovakia prior to World War II. They consisted largely of overland migrants from Wenzhou, Zhejiang. Most were Catholics. They came largely as travelling salesmen to the Bohemia region; some married local women and settled down. Up to the 1940s, a few more Chinese arrived, for example as acrobats with travelling circuses. However, most of them left the country when the war broke out. The few who did remain fled to Western Europe after the Communist takeover, when their businesses were confiscated. Due to the worsening Sino- Soviet split of the 1960s, there was little further contact between Czechoslovakia and the People's Republic of China. Hungary, rather than Czechoslovakia, was the initial hub of the post-1989 Chinese community in Eastern Europe, due to their policy of offering visa-free entry to PRC nationals; as many as 45,000 Chinese may have arrived in Hungary by 1992, largely shuttle traders and migrant workers. However, when that visa-free policy was terminated, the Chinese began to spread out to other neighbouring countries, primarily Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia. They consisted not of poor rural migrants, as was the common image in the popular imagination, but rather of former civil servants and workers in state-owned enterprise, who were giving up their \\"iron rice bowls\\" to go abroad and try to get rich as traders. In the mid-1990s, the Czech Republic briefly came to prominence as a transit point for Chinese migrants being smuggled into Western Europe, but Hungary regained its popularity by the end of the 1990s. There was a brief spike in asylum seekers in the late 1990s. Demography and distribution Most Chinese in the Czech Republic reside in Prague, though they are less concentrated than they were in the past; in 1993, only 7% of Chinese in the country lived elsewhere, but by 2000 that figure had grown to 41%. However, they remain more urbanised than any other immigrant group in the country. They come largely from Zhejiang, Beijing, and Shanghai, and men outnumber women by a ratio of three-to-two, according to unofficial surveys. In the late 1990s, there may have been as many as 9,000 Chinese in the country, including illegal migrants. However, December 2007 official figures from the Czech Statistical Office showed a total of just 4,986; this made Chinese the 10th-largest group of non-European Union foreigners. Community associations One of the earliest Chinese community associations in the Czech Republic was the Association of Chinese Business in the Czech Republic (√öst≈ôedn√≠ sdru≈æen√≠ ƒç√≠nsk√Ωch podnikatel≈Ø obchodn√≠k≈Ø v ƒåR/Êç∑ÂÖãÂçé‰∫∫Â∑•ÂïÜ‰∏öËÄÖÂçè‰ºö), referred to for short as the Shanghui (ÂïÜ‰ºö). It was founded by Mr. Li, a restaurateur from Shanghai who had previously lived in Hong Kong, Liberia, and Spain, and spoke fluent English. Though officially registered in 1995, in reality it had been operating already for several years. The organisation was plagued by scandal due to the influence of snakeheads and triads; one chairman of the Shanghui was assaulted and their offices trashed in 1995 over a commercial dispute, and many Chinese state that they were forced to join the Shanghui, pay protection fees in the guise of membership dues, and enter into price fixing schemes. The backlash against the Shanghui resulted in the foundation of another association, the Hualianhui (ÂçéËÅî‰ºö), by four women, an unusual development since most overseas Chinese associations tended to be founded and dominated by men. The first chairwoman, Ms. Weng, was an interpreter, language teacher, and author of Chinese cookery books, who had lived in the Czech Republic for over 40 years. As a direct result of the problems with Shanghui, they required recommendations from existing members and strictly screened new applicants in order to exclude problematic elements. Hualianhui was open to expatriates from the Taiwan as well as the China, which caused some tensions with the PRC embassy and made their situation in the Chinese community rather tenuous; however, in 2000, the new Chinese ambassador to the Czech Republic officially received Ms. Weng for a meeting at the embassy, and also made an appearance at their Chinese New Year celebration in 2001.

It is the fourth hydroelectric power station on the Waikato River. Lake Whakamaru is one of the larger hydro reservoirs on the Waikato river. The power station is owned and operated by Mercury Energy. The adjacent Whakamaru switching station is operated by Transpower and is one of eight reference nodes on the New Zealand national grid. History Development work started in 1949 with the construction on of road from Mangakino which at the time was the operational centre of the Waikato hydroelectric scheme. Firstly a diversion channel long, deep and wide was built taking 3 years to complete. The foundation rock turned out to be deeply cracked and filled with clays rendering it partially porous. Shafts were sunk into the rock and this allowed the clay to be cleared and cement grout was later forced into the rock which was then back-filled with concrete. Transmission Whakamaru is a major node in the North Island electricity grid. Electricity generated by Whakamaru, as well as the other five Waikato hydroelectric power stations, and from the geothermal power stations in the area converges at the Whakamaru substation on the western side of the dam. Power from Whakamaru is then transmitted via 220 kV lines to the Bay of Plenty, Hawke's Bay, Manawatu and Hamilton. The largest transmission route is to New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, approximately to the north - three 220 kV circuits connect Whakamaru to Otahuhu in southern Auckland, with an additional circuit serving Otahuhu via Hamilton. The main control centre for the electricity generation and transmission system for the entire North Island was established at Whakamaru in 1964. The facility continued to operate as the North Island System Control Centre until a replacement facility was established at Hamilton in 1992.Reilly, H (2008) p. 182-191 A major new transmission line has been constructed from Whakamaru to Brownhill Road, the Whakamaru to Brownhill Road transmission line. close to the south Auckland urban boundary. This new line re-inforces supply to Auckland and allows for the large amount of new geothermal generation that is expected in the Taupo region over the next 5‚Äì7 years. A separate switching station, designated Whakamaru North, has been built approximately from the current substation as the terminal station for the new line, with short tie-lines connecting to the existing substation. Refurbishment In 2013 a refurbishment project was begun to refurbish the turbines and generators. The first equipment arrived at site in 2016 and was installed and commissioned on the first unit in 2017. The generator replacement parts were supplied by GE Renewables. The new turbine components were supplied by Andritz Hydro.

Extinction is usually caused by damage resulting in lesions on one side of the brain. Those who are affected by extinction have a lack of awareness in the contralesional side of space (towards the left side space following a right lesion) and a loss of exploratory search and other actions normally directed toward that side.  Effect of the laterality of the sensory inputs  Right hemisphere of the brain\\" Unilateral lesions of various brain structures can cause a failure to sense contralesional stimuli in the absence of obvious sensory losses. This failure is defined as unilateral extinction if it occurs solely in the case of simultaneous bilateral sensory stimulations. Unilateral extinction can occur with bilateral visual, auditory and tactile stimuli, as well as with bilateral cross-modal stimulations of these sensory systems, and is more frequent following right hemisphere brain damage (RHD) than left hemisphere brain damage (LHD). Unilateral sensory extinction is thought by most to be explained by competition models of selective attention where each stimulus competes to gain access to limited pools of attentional resources. Because of a special role of the right hemisphere in attention, lesions of that hemisphere would disadvantage sensory inputs from the contralateral left hemispace relative from those from the right space. The idea that inputs from the contralesional side of space may undergo a faulty processing regardless of whether they are primarily directed to the damaged or intact hemisphere has been provided on the most part by studies on olfactory neglect and extinction. The laterality of the sensory inputs makes a difference insofar as left-sided inputs directed to the intact left hemisphere are not affected by extinction, or affected to a much smaller degree than left-sided inputs directed to the damaged right hemisphere. In other words, the lateral organization of sensory inputs should be reconsidered as a far from negligible factor in the cross-modal pattern of unilateral sensory extinction from unilateral brain damage.  Theories of unilateral extinction  Two of the major theories of unilateral extinction are the sensory theory and the representational theory. The sensory theory involves an attenuation of sensory input to the right hemisphere from the contralateral side of the body and space. The representational theory involves a disordered internal representation of the contralateral side of the body and space, not dependent on sensory input. Recent literature suggests that unilateral extinction patients not only fail to respond to the contralateral external space, but also to internally represented stimuli with patients frequently locating the details of the left side on the right side.  Research and characteristics of extinction  German neurologists documented clinical descriptions of extinction a century ago, but the syndrome subsequently received less systematic attention than other classical neurological syndromes in part due to the rareness of suitable theoretical ideas. Moreover, despite the dramatic loss of awareness for one side, extinction was rarely considered in discussions of the neural basis of conscious perceptual experience until recently. In extinction there is a spatially specific loss of awareness. This has been difficult to explain because so many neural pathways conventionally associated with conscious perception (including primary sensory areas) remain intact in many patients. There is also much excitement about the possibility of relating awareness to neural substrates in extinction studies. In addition to revealing the critical lesion sites associated with the various clinical manifestations of visual neglect, a key message of the current investigation is that there is a need to develop more sensitive and nuanced assessment tools to characterize the different facets of this heterogeneous syndrome. It will be important to bring laboratory tests into the clinic in an effort to identify specific cognitive functions by examining each in isolation thus combining more specific descriptions extinction with better clinical measures that isolate specific cognitive functions to yield more consistent lesion mapping results in the future.  Grouping effect in extinction  Figure from a paper by J. Driver and P. Vuilleumier explaining the effect of grouping on extinction reduction. Neglect and extinction often present simultaneously in patients. When looking at neglect, studies have demonstrated that there is more to the spatial nature than mere primary sensory loss. Proposals of this kind have become increasingly frequent in recent years but attentional accounts for neglect are not universally popular. We can think of one primary component of neglect as involving inattention and that extinction is by no means the whole story for neglect. Extinction encapsulates a critical general principle that applies for most aspects of neglect, namely that the patient's spatial deficit is most apparent in competitive situations, where information towards the good ipsilesional side comes to dominate information that would otherwise be acknowledged towards the contralesional side. This may relate to the attentional limitation seen in neurologically healthy people. We cannot become aware of multiple targets all at once, even if our sensory systems have transduced them. This is seen in patients with extinction, who are able to detect a single target in any location, with a deficit only for multiple concurrent targets. Therefore, extinction can be regarded as a pathological, spatially specific exaggeration of the normal difficulty in distributing attention to multiple targets so we can predict that it should be reduced if the two competing events could be grouped together. Several recent findings from right-parietal patients with left extinction confirm this prediction, suggesting that grouping mechanisms may still operate despite the pathological spatial bias of the patient to influence whether a particular stimulus will reach the patient's awareness. Thus extinction is reduced when the concurrent target events can be linked into a single subjective object, becoming allies rather than competitors in the bid to attract attention. Furthermore, the extent of residual processing extinct stimuli can vary from one patient to another, depending on the exact extent of their lesion. The examples of residual unconscious processing so far all concern the visual modality although evidence is starting to emerge concerning similar effects for extinguished tactile and auditory stimuli.  Physiology/characteristics  Extinction as well as spatial neglect are deficits caused by large lesions in the vasculatory territory of the medial cerebral artery [20]. Some studies say that extinction occurs after damage to the right or left hemisphere. Patients with extinction do not report stimuli located in space contralateral to their damaged hemisphere when the stimuli are presented simultaneously with ipsilesional stimuli. Extinction to double simultaneous stimulation is not only attributed to a primary sensory deficit since these patients are aware of contralateral stimuli presented individually. Attentional Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is more focused on as a role of abnormal sensory processing of contralesional input. The patients have a pathologically limited attentional capacity and an attentional bias towards ipsilesional space, they are more likely to attend to and become aware of ipsilesional stimuli at the expense of contralesional ones. It is noteworthy that the right Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ) has been linked to a number of cognitive functions that suggest a role in modulating competitive interactions between stimulus representations, which would converge with the importance of this area for the attentional deficit displayed by extinction patients. The critical lesion site responsible for the syndrome has been debated for more than a decade. Different criterion was used to identify extinction in their patient samples, which lead to inconsistencies in the critical lesion sites reported across studies. Recent studies have used measures such as ERPs and fMRI and it is believed that the parietal lobe mediates the internal representation of both body and space. They found that in their sample, a cortical lesion was almost always found in the right parietal angula gyrus region. Patients typically showed damage to the inferior parietal areas of the brain. There can also be preserved function in the superior parietal lobe, even with inferior parietal damage. Parietal regions include some neurons with ipsilateral receptive fields, so that while the representation within one hemisphere emphasizes contralateral space overall, some ipsilateral representation is present also. More specifically, the number of left- hemisphere neurons with visual receptive fields at a particular location decreases monotonically as one considers increasingly peripheral locations in the left visual field, and vice versa in the right hemisphere. This might go some way towards explaining why extinction is more severe after right- hemisphere lesions in people, leaving the patient with just the steep gradient of the intact left hemisphere.  Types  Tactile = Patients with tactile extinction are aware of being touched on a contralesional limb, but seem unaware of similar contralesional touch if touched simultaneously on their ipsilesional limb. In the tactile, extinction occurs in the domains of at the level of the hands, the face-neck, the arms-legs, both in case of symmetrical and asymmetrical stimulations, or between the two sides of a single body-part. Extinguished tactile stimulus does not access consciousness but it may interfere with perception of the ipsilesional one. Considerable processing can still take place prior to the level at which loss of awareness arises. The extinction can also rise in bilateral conditions. In a patient study, bilateral trials with extinction still revealed residual early components over the right hemisphere in response to the extinguished left touches. When somatosensory neural activity in the right hemisphere was reduced in amplitude when compared to the one by right hand stimulation on the left hemisphere. So it can be concluded that tactile extinction is defined in conditions of bilateral stimulation and perhaps unilateral stimulation as well. Extinction arises at a high level of tactile input processing. = Visual extinction = Visual/spatial extinction, also known as pseudohemianopia, is the inability to perceive two simultaneous stimuli in each visual field. Those who show spatial extinction can detect a single item in both the left and right visual fields but, under certain conditions of bilateral double simultaneous stimulation (DSS), fails to detect the item in one field.Iain D. Gilchrist, Glyn W. Humphreys & M. Jane Riddoch (1996): Grouping and Extinction: Evidence for Low-level Modulation of Visual Selection, Cognitive Neuropsychology, 13:8, 1223‚Äì1249 It is thus believed that extinction is caused by sensory neglect, and that extinction reflects an attentional deficit rather than a contralesional deficit in primary perceptual processing.Baylis, Gordon C., Jon Driver, and Robert D. Rafal. \\"Visual Extinction and Stimulus Repetition.\\" Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 5.4 (2007): 453-66. In visual extinction this attentional deficit in perception applies mainly to attention in the relevant dimension. Visual extinction is greatest when objects either have the same color or the same shape. Studies suggest that brain damage to the parietal lobe causes sensory neglect and that in turn causes extinction. Spatial neglect specifically leads to visual extinction. Neglect often follows right inferior parietal damage, and is characterized by impaired attention and lack of awareness for stimuli on the contralesional (left) side of space. Any kind of brain damage can lead to neglect, things like stroke, brain tissue death, or tumors, and cause the unilateral damage to one side of the parietal lobe. Overall a person with parietal brain damage still has intact visual fields. One way to reduce the effects of extinction is to use grouping of items. Brightness and edge based grouping reduces visual extinction and they act in an additive way. Grouping with similar shapes also reduces the effects of extinction. This suggests that the attentional deficit in extinction can be compensated, at least in part, by the brain's object recognition systems. While the parietal lobe deals with sensation and perception, the amygdala controls the perception of fear and emotion. This means that by utilizing the perception abilities of the amygdala that emotional properties of contralesional stimuli can be extracted despite pathological inattention and unawareness. This is because the ability of the amygdala to perceive fear is autonomous and without conscious effort and attention. Unfortunately studies have shown that perception of fear can become habituated so it can be unreliable to reduce extinction by use of the amygdala. = Auditory extinction = Auditory extinction is the failure to hear simultaneous stimuli on the left and right sides. This extinction is also caused by brain damage on one side of the brain where awareness is lost on the contralesional side. Affected people report the presence of side specific phonemes, albeit extinguishing them at the same time. This points to the fact that auditory extinction, like other forms of extinction, is more about acknowledging a stimulus in the contralesional side than about the actual sensing of the stimulus. Just like other forms of extinction, auditory extinction is caused by brain damage resulting in lesions to one side of the parietal lobe. Auditory extinction appears to be a rather common phenomenon in the acute state of a vascular disease. The acute state of the vascular disease usually leads to neglect which then in turn leads to the auditory extinction. The number of lesions causes an additive effect when occurring in combination with a recent damage. When it comes to treating and recognizing the occurrence of auditory extinction most sound can still be perceived with the other ear. The nature of sound, which possess directionality but still fills space, makes it more amenable to misattribution of source location. This is called the ‚Äòprior entry‚Äô effect. This is when a stimulus occurring at an attended location receives privileged access to awareness relative to one occurring at an unattended location. = Chemical extinction = Little is known on the side of occurrence of unilateral extinction or neglect for sensory modalities, which are traditionally thought to project to the brain in a predominantly uncrossed fashion, such as olfaction and taste. To date, only a limited number of investigations concerning the suppression of (or competition among) spatial information processed through the so-called chemical senses have been reported. A number of various different reasons may account for this lack of research. First, the distinction between pure chemical versus somatosensory information is often problematic. Second, it is widely assumed that olfaction and taste are senses that are not specialized for conveying spatial information.  Olfactory extinction  Multiple case studies and investigations have been conducted on unilateral neglect within the visual, auditory, and tactile sensory modalities, but only three case studies have been reported on neglect within the olfactory sensory modality. It is still unclear whether humans can localize at all the source of the olfactory stimulation by distinguishing between odors that are processed through the right versus the left nostril. This is particularly true when the stimulus is a pure odorant rather than trigeminal, that is when the odor does not cause any somatosensory stimulation that is known to be encoded by the trigeminal system. It was discovered that when pure odorants such as hydrogen sulfide or vanillin were used as stimulants localization was random. On the other hand, stimulation with carbon dioxide or menthol yielded identification rates of more than 96%. These results established the fact that directional orientation, considering single momentary odorous sensations, can only be assumed, when the olfactory stimulants simultaneously excite the trigeminal somatosensory system. Thus it is possible to distinguish between right and left side when the substances additionally or mainly excited the trigeminal nerve. RHD patients with left tactile and visual neglect were reported to exhibit neglect and extinction of olfactory stimuli to the left nostril, in spite of the anatomically constrained projection of the olfactory input from that nostril to the intact left hemisphere. This finding was taken to suggest an impaired processing of all inputs from the contralesional side of space, regardless of whether such inputs were primarily directed to the damaged right hemisphere or the intact left hemisphere. Yet this interpretation is questionable because normal subjects appear unable to localize to a nostril a lateralized olfactory stimulus without the aid of an associated stimulation of the crossed trigeminal input from that same nostril. Further, and in keeping with the above notion, on a number of unilateral and bilateral olfactory stimulations those patients identified the left nostril input correctly, but misplaced it to the right nostril, possibly because of a rightward response bias related to left-sided neglect. Specifically, when two different stimuli were delivered to each nostril, RHD patients consistently failed to report the stimulus delivered to the left nostril. The olfactory system predominantly projects its fibers ipsilaterally thus these results are evidence supporting the representational theory of neglect. Also patients affected by olfactory extinction showed a large number of displacements in that the correctly identified stimuli presented to the left nostril were described as being in the right nostril. Nevertheless, it is not completely possible to determine the exact influence exerted by the nasal somatosensation in the olfactory extinction reported, since one of the odours considered as being pure odorants was later found to be processed probably also by the trigeminal. It appears that the human olfactory system is able to localize the source of the olfactory stimulation only when the odour elicits also a trigeminal response. This contradicts the idea that trained participants can localize both trigeminal stimuli and pure odorants between the two nostrils. Moreover, recently it was shown that naive participants were able to reliably localize pure odorants between the two nostrils. Clearly, if the ability of the olfactory system to extract spatial information from non-trigeminal stimuli turns out to be true, new light could be shed on the extinction phenomena described for odors. The olfactory sense also provides a unique mechanism to test the sensory and representational theories of unilateral neglect. Olfactory information projects predominantly to the ipsilateral hemisphere. Patients with a right hemisphere lesion show left sided neglect in other modalities and fail to respond to the left contralateral nostril, thus the representational theory is supported. It was suggested that since the olfactory sensory pathways to the cerebral hemispheres were not crossed, a neglect should have occurred on the right side if a sensory loss were the cause of neglect. Neglect in olfactory sense is compared with its occurrence in the trigeminal sense, a sense stimulated in the same manner as olfaction (chemically through the nasal passages) but contralaterally innervated. Studies supporting the representational theory of unilateral neglect show that right hemisphere lesion patients with left unilateral neglect failed to respond to their left contralateral nostril on olfactory double simultaneous stimulation in spite of adequate olfactory sensitivity. This demonstrated that the occurrence of unilateral neglect is not a function of sensory attenuation, in fact, olfactory sensitivity did not correlate with number of extinctions.  Extinction of taste  The existence of neglect and/or extinction in taste is less explored than olfaction, even though in humans the ability to localize taste stimuli presented on the tongue has been previously described. In the case of a patient with a wide parietal-occipital tumor, tactile extinction on the upper limbs and extinction of taste sensations on the left part of the tongue were seen when two tastes were presented simultaneously on each hemitongue. The results of the assessment revealed there is unimodal taste extinction and displacement of taste sensations under crossmodal taste- tactile stimulation. In particular, when a touch was delivered to the right hemi-tongue and a taste was applied on the left hemi-tongue, the patient repeatedly reported bilateral taste stimulation, thus surprisingly extinguishing the right touch and partially misplacing the left taste stimulus. Gustatory extinction also seems to occur consequently to a severe tactile extinction. In the gustatory test done on patients with right brain damage (RHD) or left brain damage (LHD) and healthy subjects, nine RHD patients with left hemitongue tactile extinction showed no gustatory extinction for both unilateral and bilateral stimulations. Contrary to a largely crossed cortical representation of the limbs and other exteroceptive body sites, the tongue has been traditionally thought to enjoy a bilateral representation in the cortex for both somatic and gustatory modalities. In fact the tongue representation is bilateral in both modalities, but predominantly ipsilateral in the gustatory modality and predominantly contralateral in the tactile modality. The absence of left gustatory extinction in those patients can be attributed to the predominant channeling of left hemitongue taste inputs into the intact left hemisphere. Since there were no severe disturbances manifested in any of the present RHD or LHD patients, it seems reasonable to assume that gustatory extinction surfaces only as an accompaniment and possibly a consequence of a very marked extinction of tactile lingual sensitivity, or even a full blown intraoral tactile hemineglect. There is still no clear evidence of the existence of purely taste extinction and/or neglect. More evidence that suggests the relationship between tactile and taste extinction in the tongue comes from a patient with a right parieto-occipital glioblastoma, tested with local applications of the four basic tastants (bitter, salty, sour, sweet), or with touch and pin prick stimuli to the two sides of the tongue. The patient missed most of the left hemitongue stimuli on bilateral stimulation, or less frequently wrongly attributed to them the quality of the concurrent right stimulus. Combinations of taste and mechanical stimuli showed an interference of left side stimuli on the perception of right stimuli, suggesting a complex alteration of the central tactile and gustatory representations of both sides of the tongue. Given that taste perception is usually co-mingled with tactile sensations, it is possible that left-sided gustatory extinction in severe left buccal hemineglect was secondary to left-sided lingual tactile extinction. = Multisensory = Neglect and extinction can overlap for a single sensory modality, and even for multiple sensory modalities. Extinction affecting a unimodal sensory system can be influenced by the concurrent activation of another modality. Tactile extinction, as an example, can be modulated by visual events simultaneously presented in the region near the tactile stimulation, increasing or reducing tactile perception, depending upon the spatial arrangement of the stimuli. In one example of visual and tactile relationship, the visual stimulation in the ipsilesional side exacerbates contralesional tactile extinction, whereby the presentation of visual and tactile stimuli on the same contralesional side can reduce the deficit. Tactile and visual informations can also be integrated in other peripersonal space regions, such as around the face. Another similar modulation interaction is between audition and touch. The contralesional tactile detection is hampered by sounds in tactile extinction patients. However, a multisensory effect observed in the front space with respect to the patients‚Äô head was even stronger when cross-modal auditory-tactile extinction was assessed in the patients‚Äô back space. Different degrees of multisensory integration may occur depending upon the functional relevance of a given modality. Altogether, the interactions of cross-modal seems to be a rather frequent occurrence. The results of these studies underline the relevance of cross-modal integration in enhancing visual processing in neglect patients and in patients with visual field deficits.

The Schutzenberger groups associated with different H-classes are different. However, the groups associated with two different H-classes contained in the same D-class of a semigroup are isomorphic. Moreover, if the H-class itself were a group, the Schutzenberger group of the H-class would be isomorphic to the H-class. In fact, there are two Schutzenberger groups associated with a given H-class and each is antiisomorphic to the other. The Schutzenberger group was discovered by Marcel-Paul Sch√ºtzenberger in 1957 (MR 19, 249) (pp. 63-66) and the terminology was coined by A. H. Clifford. The Schutzenberger group Let S be a semigroup and let S1 be the semigroup obtained by adjoining an identity element 1 to S (if S already has an identity element, then S1 = S). Green's H-relation in S is defined as follows: If a and b are in S then :a H b ‚áî there are u, v, x, y in S1 such that ua = ax = b and vb = by = a. For a in S, the set of all b 's in S such that a H b is the Green H-class of S containing a, denoted by Ha. Let H be an H-class of the semigroup S. Let T(H) be the set of all elements t in S1 such that Ht is a subset of H itself. Each t in T(H) defines a transformation, denoted by Œ≥t, of H by mapping h in H to ht in H. The set of all these transformations of H, denoted by Œì(H), is a group under composition of mappings (taking functions as right operators). The group Œì(H) is the Schutzenberger group associated with the H-class H.  Examples  If H is a maximal subgroup of a monoid M (a semigroup with identity), then H is an H-class, and it is naturally isomorphic to its own Schutzenberger group. In general, one has that the cardinality of H and its Schutzenberger group coincide for any H-class H.  Applications  It is known that a monoid with finitely many left and right ideals is finitely presented (or just finitely generated) if and only if all of its Schutzenberger groups are finitely presented (respectively, finitely generated). Similarly such a monoid is residually finite if and only if all of its Schutzenberger groups are residually finite.

History Kingston Mills. Watercolor by James Pattison Cockburn, ca. 1830 Kingston Mills developed because of a series of falls (known as Cataraqui Falls) on the Cataraqui River. In 1784, a grist mill and saw mill were built by the British government on the falls to serve the residents of the growing Loyalist settlement at Cataraqui, now Kingston. Under orders from Major John Ross who was in charge of the Cataraqui settlement, Lieutenant David Brass of Butler's Rangers built a road to the falls from Cataraqui. This was the first road built in Upper Canada.Armstrong 1973, p.46 \\"King's Mill\\", the area's original name, became a major location for settlers to bring produce. Several mills were built over the years; the structures were often damaged by fire or water, or left abandoned. After the War of 1812 Kingston's naval base on Point Frederick was deemed vulnerable to American attack. Since Kingston Mills was considered to be better protected from attack because of its inland position, land was acquired and surveyed at Kingston Mills for a naval stores depot with accompanying fortifications. The depot was never built, however, since British priorities changed from improving Kingston's naval infrastructure to building military fortifications around Kingston.Osborne and Swainson 2011, pp. 60-61. Thomas Burrowes Beginning in 1827, the site was cleared to begin building locks for the Rideau Canal. The locks would enable boats to bypass the falls. Four locks (Nos. 46, 47, 48, and 49) were constructed, all of which have a lift of 3.6 metres. A defensive blockhouse was constructed beginning in 1832. It housed militia and British regular troops from 1838 to 1841. It is one of four situated along the Rideau Canal. The blockhouse has been restored to the condition it may have looked like in the 1830s. In 1853 a wooden railway bridge was built by the Grand Trunk Railroad over the lower locks. The Canadian National Railway replaced this bridge with a steel bridge in 1929. Since 1909, several bridges over the canal along Kingston Mills Road have been constructed and replaced. The last bridge, a steel swing bridge, was built in 1988. Lock 47 at Kingston Mills. This is one of the three lower locks.

Ten years later he was surprised and slain by Oirads under Toghan (Esen's father), and his son submitted to China.

He was selected as an All-American halfback on the 1899 College Football All-America Team. He was the first Carlisle player and the first American Indian to be selected as an All- American. He was born in 1874 on the Cattaraugus Reservation in New York. All-American for Carlisle Seneca was a member of the Seneca tribe who grew up on the Cattaraugus Reservation in western New York State. Seneca played football for Carlisle from 1896 to 1899 and 1901. The first Carlisle football team was formed in 1895, and Seneca was the school's first All-American‚Äînearly a decade before Jim Thorpe began playing for the school. In 1896, Carlisle played games against college football's \\"Big Four\\" (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Penn) and nearly defeated Yale. The New York Times reported on a run by Seneca that nearly won the game against Yale: > \\"Seneca was given the ball to go through the centre. He got through with one > or two Yale men hanging on to him. Then he squirmed and shook off the Yale > men, dodged a man or two, and, making a splendid run down the field, made > what was thought to be a touchdown. Nearly all on the grounds shouted > themselves hoarse. Men waved their hats in the air, pretty gals clapped > their hands ...\\" However, the referee waved off the touchdown, ruling that Seneca was \\"down\\" when the Yale players hung on to him. The New York Times wrote the next day that the referee had made the wrong call and that Carlisle had been robbed of a touchdown, but the game went into the record books as a 12-6 win for Yale. Isaac Seneca's brother, Victor Seneca, also played for Carlisle. On the train returning from a game against the University of Pennsylvania in 1897, Victor was killed when he put his head out the window of the train and was struck by a telegraph pole. In 1899, Glenn \\"Pop\\" Warner was hired as the head football coach and athletic director at Carlisle. In Warner's first season at Carlisle, the Carlisle team faced a difficult schedule, playing games against top opponents and traveling to games in New York (twice), Philadelphia, Phoenix and San Francisco. The 1899 Carlisle team posted an 8-2 record and was ranked fourth in the nation. Carlisle defeated Columbia 42-0 in a game played in Manhattan on Thanksgiving Day 1899 with 10,000 fans in attendance. Seneca was the star of the game, having two runs of 30 yards and another of 40 yards. A press account of the game said: \\"The Indians were in prime physical condition and bore through the Columbia line and skirted the ends at will. At least eight times the Carlisle backs got around the ends for runs of thirty to sixty yards. Most of these runs were made by Seneca and Miller.\\" At the end of the 1899 season, Seneca was elected as captain of the 1900 team (though he would opt to play professional football rather than return in 1900). After the regular season, the Carlisle team accepted an invitation to play the University of California, San Francisco on Christmas Day. Carlisle won the game, 2-0. The Carlisle school newspaper wrote the following about Seneca after his return from California in January 1900: > \\"Isaac Seneca, the newly elected Captain, felt it an honor to be chosen as > Captain for such a team. He never had an idea that he would see the Pacific > Ocean. In that trip he had learned more of the geography of the country than > he could have learned from books. When he used to play on the scrub teams > for amusement, he never had an idea that he would reach the first team, and > now that he was chosen captain he felt the great responsibility and honor of > his position. He paid Mr. Thompson tribute as an excellent athletic > teacher.\\" After the 1899 season, Seneca was also honored by being named a first team All-American‚Äîthe first Carlisle player and the first American Indian to be so honored. He was later named by Athlon Athletics to the All-Time American Indian College Football Team. In a 1960 feature article about the Carlisle Indians, Sports Illustrated noted that the accomplishments of Seneca and Thorpe created an \\"ageless myth\\" for the American Indians: > \\"There was an element of grandeur, something almost mythological, in the > rise of the Carlisle Indians to national and then to world fame ... And the > Indians had an incentive to save their people as poignant as any in history. > Isaac Seneca, for instance, came from a New York tribe that was down to > 2,700 survivors. There were only about 600 left in the Oklahoma tribe to > which Jim Thorpe belonged. Their tribes were perishing, and the epic > striving of the Carlisle Indians was a last great effort to reach the > unattainable ...\\" Professional football After leaving Carlisle, Seneca briefly played professional football for the Greensburg Athletic Association in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. In an October 1900 game against Altoona, Seneca made several substantial gains, including a 25-yard run and a 50-yard touchdown run. During a game against Latrobe in 1900, a fight broke out between Seneca and Latrobe's quarterback, Al Kennedy. The crowd of 2,000 spectators joined in what one historic account has called \\"a general donnybrook.\\" Later years Information on Seneca's later years is lacking, though a 1917 publication noted that a Carlisle graduate named Isaac Seneca was the head of the blacksmithing department at the Chilocco Indian Agricultural School near Ponca City, Oklahoma. A 1928 article notes that Seneca is now \\"in the government service\\". At the time of the 1930 United States Census, Seneca was listed as a blacksmith working in Ponca City, Oklahoma. Seneca moved back to New York sometime between 1937 and 1940; at the time of the 1940 United States Census, he was living at the Cattaraugus Reservation, Erie County, New York, listed as widowed, working as a blacksmith. Isaac Seneca is interred at United Missions Cemetery at the Cataraugus Reservation in the Seneca Nation, Erie County, New York. See also * Benjey, Tom (2008).

He was the elder brother of England international footballer, Fred Blackburn. Football career Blackburn was born in the village of Billington, Lancashire and first joined his local club, Blackburn Rovers, in March 1895. After three years of reserve-team football, he spent the 1898‚Äì99 season with Northamptonshire club Wellingborough playing in the Midland League. He returned to Blackburn in the summer of 1899; by now his brother Fred had become established at outside-left. Arthur once again spent most of his time at Ewood Park playing in Rovers' reserve team while keeping fit by voluntarily working on the renovation of a church, and only managed two first- team appearances in the 1899‚Äì1900 season. In May 1900, Blackburn was persuaded to move to the south coast to join Southampton in the Southern League. Blackburn Rovers were reluctant to part company with him, but the financial inducements offered by Southampton persuaded him to try his luck in the south. Described as \\"strongly built\\", Blackburn \\"never gave less than 100%, but at time his play was too impetuous to be reliable\\". He made his \\"Saints\\" debut at right-back in the opening match of the 1900‚Äì01 season, a 4‚Äì3 victory at Luton Town and played in nine of the first ten games of the season until a serious ankle injury put him out of the side, with Bertram Sharp taking over. Blackburn was unable to regain his place and in the summer of 1901 he returned to his home-town club where he made two further appearances in the 1901‚Äì02 season. Later career Blackburn is known to have coached subsequently in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, before returning to Blackburn, where he ran a retail tobacconist shop.

Description The fruit bodies of Cymatoderma fungi are typically funnel-shaped, fan-shaped, or semicircular. Fruit bodies growing next to each other can fuse together. The upper surface of the cap often has sharp ridges, although in some species this is partially obscured by a thick tomentum with a texture like felt. The fertile surface of the hymenium (spore- bearing surface) is generally covered with folds, undulations, or ridges, which can be in turn by smooth, warted, or spiky. The stipe ranges from well- developed in some species to barely present in others. Taxonomy Cymatoderma was circumscribed by botanist Friedrich Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn in 1842, with Cymatoderma elegans as the type species. Cymatoderma dendriticum, originally described by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon as Thelephora dendritica in 1827, is perhaps the earliest description of any Cymatoderma in the literature. In 1842, Miles Joseph Berkeley transferred Thelephora dendritica to the genus Cladoderris. Despite Junghuhn's earlier publication, this species became more commonly (and incorrectly) referred to as Cladoderris dendritica in its early history. This led to a number of synonyms created and a confusing taxonomy. It did not help that the type material of several species, located in the Berlin herbarium, was destroyed during the Second World War. Marinus Anton Donk proposed to conserve the more popular name Cladoderris against the earlier Cymatoderma, but this was rejected by the authorities on Fungus nomenclature. Today, the name Cladoderris is placed in synonymy with Cymatoderma, as well as the names Actinostroma, Beccariella, and Beccaria. Classification Cymatoderma has traditionally been classified in the family Meruliaceae. Molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that Cymatoderma is polyphyletic, with some species related to Podoscypha, and another group, including the type species, grouped together in a distant location in the residual clade of the Polyporales. In a recently proposed family-level classification of the Polyporales, Alfredo Justo and colleagues proposed to include these latter Cymatoderma species (sensu stricto) in the new family Panaceae. Species closely related to Podoscypha, including Cymatoderma dendriticum and C. pallens, are better classified in the family Podoscyphaceae. Species Cymatoderma elegans A 2008 estimate placed nine species in the genus. , Index Fungorum accepts 14 species in Cymatoderma: *Cymatoderma africanum Boidin (1960) ‚Äì Cameroon; Ivory Coast; Zambia *Cymatoderma blumei (L√©v.)

Diagnostic techniques used include the patient's history and physical examination, venous imaging techniques in particular vascular ultrasound and laboratory evaluation related to venous thromboembolism. The American Medical Association and the American Osteopathic Association has added phlebology to their list of self-designated practice specialties. A significant part of a phlebologist's work is involved with the treatment of superficial venous disease, frequently of the leg. Conditions often treated include venous stasis ulcers, varicose veins and spider veins (telangiectasia). Other conditions managed by phlebologists include deep venous thrombosis (DVT), superficial thrombophlebitis, and venous malformations. Regulatory requirements for phlebology certification are different in Europe and the USA. In the USA, licensed physicians with documented experience in treating veins and adequate vascular ultrasound experience can receive certification by passing a test created by the American Board of Venous and Lymphatic Medicine a privately owned corporation committed to maintaining a high standard of care for venous disease.

Thomas Whitelock Kempthorne and Evan Prosser entered into business together in 1870 as chemists. They set up Kempthorne Prosser, which became a limited liability company in 1879. The head office was set up on Stafford Street in City Rise, Dunedin. In 1904 Thomas Whitelock Kempthorne retired. Kempthorne Prosser & Co became Kempthorne Prosser & Co. Ltd in 1879 when the New Zealand Drug Company was formed.  Superphosphate  In early 1881 the NZ Government offered a bonus for three years to any company that would manufacture 50 tons of sulphuric acid per year. KP's NZ Drug Company was the first in the country to combine sulphuric acid and bone dust to produce superphosphate. The Burnside Chemical Works in Dunedin was the first of its type in New Zealand. Kempthorne Prosser constructed further superphosphate plants in Auckland, Christchurch, and Wanganui. From this stemmed a major chemical fertiliser industry, of national importance to the agricultural and pastoral economy. For almost a century 'K. P.' was to dominate the market. Prosser resigned from the company in 1886 and went to Australia before committing suicide. By the mid-1970s, some New Zealand farmers decided it was time to take control of the fertiliser industry, and established a new company, the Ravensdown Fertiliser Co-operative Ltd. With help from Brierley Investments and producer board funds it acquired Kempthorne Prosser in 1978, and Kempthorne Prosser exited the market. In 2014 there were 25,062 shareholders in Ravensdown and it was New Zealand's leading fertiliser company. 'Ravensdown' as a name comes from the 'Raven', taken from the Ravensbourne site combined with the 'down' taken from the Seadown site. Kempthorne Prosser operated four large chemical works.

There were further premises at number 132 High Street, Christchurch. The High St premises were to be demolished in 1987. Thomas Whitelock Kempthorne (1834‚Äì1915) Thomas Whitelock Kempthorne was born in Cornwall, England. He was the son of John Kempthorne and Anne Whitelock. He was baptised on 3 February 1834. In 1854 he emigrated to Melbourne, Australia. He worked briefly as a labourer digging up tree stumps. In 1855 he found a position in the wholesale drug trade. On 23 June 1859 in Melbourne he married Sarah Inman. They had five daughters and one son before Sarah's death in 1895. Kempthorne arrived in Dunedin in April 1863, sent by the Melbourne pharmaceutical firm of H. & E. Youngman to look at the prospects of establishing a warehouse there. When the company's managers died Thomas Kempthorne stayed in Dunedin and set up his own drug business, French Kempthorne & Co (after going in partnership with a Mr French). It did not last very long and in 1870 Kempthorne, Prosser & Company was formed when he went into partnership with Evan Prosser, a Welsh chemist on the West Coast. The partnership prospered and in 1879 they set up a limited liability company with capital of ¬£200,000. He became a prominent figure in the Dunedin business community, remaining managing director of Kempthorne, Prosser & Company until 1904 when he retired. He gave generous support of St. Paul's Cathedral, Dunedin. He was a member of the board of managers of the Dunedin Technical School (later King Edward Technical College) from 1911 to 1915 and made a donation of ¬£900 towards its new building. On 29 March 1899 in Dunedin he married Annie Charlotte Rawdon Robinson, about 40 years younger than he. They had one daughter and Annie Kempthorne died in 1903 aged 31 years. In 1901 as the first Dunedin citizen to own a car he created a minor sensation when he was driven along Princes Street in his steam-operated two cylinder Locomobile with one of his company's engineers at the tiller. New Zealand, he concluded, was 'a land...in which man indeed is blest.' He became unwell at a board meeting of the National Insurance Company and died of a cerebral haemorrhage in Dunedin on 3 November 1915. Evan Prosser (1830s‚Äì1896) Prosser was elected to the County Council in 1873, and represented the ratepayers of South Ward until the 1st of August, 1875. He was a Welshman by birth, and arrived on the West Coast during the gold rush. Subsequently he removed to Dunedin, where, with Mr. Kempthorne, he formed the nucleus of the since-important firm of Kemptorne, Prosser and Co. Mr. Prosser afterwards retired from the firm and went to Sydney. He was the second Mayor of Hokitika, and held office in the year 1868.

It is the official residence of the United States Ambassador to France.  History  In 1710, Henri Fran√ßois d'Aguesseau, Chancellor of France, acquired a tract of land which included the present site of the H√¥tel de Pontalba. Ten years later, he built a house, and the house subsequently passed through a series of owners. New Orleans-born Baroness Micaela Almonester de Pontalba purchased the property in 1836, and by 1842, she had demolished the d'Aguesseau house and commissioned the architect Louis Visconti to design a newer house for the site. Construction of the mansion was finished in 1855. Baroness de Pontalba occupied the mansion until her death in 1874, upon which it was willed to her heirs who sold the property to Baron Edmond James de Rothschild in 1876. Baron de Rothschild hired Felix Langlais to substantially renovate, enlarge, and embellish the residence, leaving only the original gatehouse and portals intact, but following much of the H-shaped ground floor plan. During World War II, the mansion, then owned by Baron Maurice de Rothschild, was requisitioned by Nazi Germany as an officers' club for the Luftwaffe. After the war, it was rented out to the British Royal Air Force Club, and then to the U.S. In 1948, the American government purchased the building, primarily for the United States Information Service. These offices were moved to the H√¥tel Talleyrand as restoration was completed in 1971 during the tenure of Ambassador Arthur K. Watson. The building then became the official residence of the ambassador.

Born in 1966, Kyabje Tripa Rinpoche is also known as the Eighth B√∂n Tsang Triwa, (in pinyin, Tubudan Quejijianzan Rinpoche.) According to Buddhist Tripa Rinpoche is the incarnation of Dharmakaya Samantabhadra (the Bodhisattva representing universal wisdom) and is also the incarnation of one of the eight main disciples of Lama Tsongkapa, a combination that is extremely rare in the Tibetan Buddhist system of incarnation. The Eighth B√∂n Tsang Rinpoche was born on 18 June 1966 in Sershul (Shiqu) County, on the bank of the Zachu River (‚ÄúDza Chu‚Äù in Tibetan). At the age of 16, Tripa Rinpoche received the vow of a novice monk from Khenpo Thubten Wangpo, the incarnation of Dega Ch√∂gyel Tenpa Tsering. Sershul Triwa Rinpoche first joined at Changma Monastery, in Sershul County, near his birthplace. At the age of 18 he was recognized by several important tulkus as the incarnation of the Seventh B√∂n Tsang tulku of Sershul Monastery, of the Gelug school. The next year he took charge as the thirty seventh abbot of Sershul Monastery and was put in charge of the educational administration of more than 60 subsidiary monasteries. At the age of 20, he received his full ordination from Khenpo Thubten Wangpo. In 1995, the Administration of the Ganzi Prefecture officially issued him with a certificate to recognize his incarnation and held an enthronement ceremony in his honour. Sershul Triwa Rinpoche's Gelug lamas are the Dalai Lama, the 10th Panchen Lama, Gongtang Rinpoche, Thubten Wangpo, Dorje Chang Lobzang Tenzin, Dorje Chang Ngawang La Ong, Tashi Yondzin Rinpoche, Dorje Chang Gend√ºn Gyamtso Rinpoche, Ngawang Dadrak Rinpoche, Tendzin Setsang Lobzang Palden Rinpoche, Dorje Chang Dampa Zangpo and Lhamo Yondzin Rinpoche. His Nyingma masters are Khempo Jigme Phuntsok, Khenpo Ch√∂yang Chabdhar, Dzagyel Khempo Bumpa, Khempo Karzang Khedrup and Khempo Pema Wangyal. His Kagyu lamas are Orgyen Tulku Rinpoche, and many others. Sershul Triwa Rinpoche has always held a non-sectarian view, also called the Rime movement, and has a deep respect for all traditions and lamas from all schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Tripa Rinpoche has more than 10'000 Chinese students in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhong, Chengdu, etc. And tens of thousands in Tibet.  Sershul Monastery  Sershul Monastery is situated on the Tibetan plateau at an elevation of 4,000 meters where the borders of Qinghai, Tibet Autonomous Region and Sichuan meet. Sershul is the largest Gelugpa monastery in the Tibetan Kham region and has the only Buddhist Monastic University in the Kham region that is qualified to teach and bestow the highest Tibetan Buddhist geshe degree. Home to 1300 monks, Sershul Monastery is the largest Gelug monastery in Kham, and the religious center of Zachukha (or Sershul) County‚Äîthe highest, largest, poorest, coldest, and most remote county in Sichuan Province. It has six existing temples, most of which are fairly well preserved since before 1949. The largest temple, which is more than 300 years old, contains two great chanting halls devoted to Je Tsongkhapa, founder of the Gelug Order. It also contains many precious relics including one of Je Tsongkhapa's teeth preserved within a sacred choeten (stupa) in the upper gallery. Sershul Monastery was established in 1701 and to date has kept a collection of rare sacred Buddhist objects, like the wooden block and hammer used during the initiation and penance ceremonies of monks at the Nalanda University in India at the time of Shakyamuni Buddha ‚Äì some of the objects having a history of more than 2,000 years. The monastery also has many valuable sacred relics left by eminent monks after their deaths. Examples are for instance when Thinley Norbu lama died in 1995, a mark was left on his skull in the image Vajrapani. In 1997 when Triwa Lobsang lama died, an image of Arya Tara was left on his heart.  Rinpoche's activities  The monastery, under the guidance of Triwa Rinpoche, is managed in an orderly manner, with strict religious discipline and rigorous religious practice. A large number of monks want to join the monastery and today there are several monks who are in silent retreat. In July 2005, students of the Buddhist Monastic University of the Sershul Monastery obtained the first four places in the National Examination for Higher Tibetan Buddhist Institutes in China. In 2006, The monastery established a Hospital of Traditional Tibetan medicine, In 2012 completely a Tibetan Old Age Home, the Menshul Charity, an orphanage with a technical school is learning home of 750 studants approximately, even running very well. In this way the monastery solved some substantial social problems for the local government administration and brought hope for the local Tibetans. A grand new temple devoted to AmitƒÅbha, a Tibetan medicine hospital, a guest house, and a primary school for local children were built. The AmitƒÅbha Temple, Retreat House, and guest house opened in 2000 in a tremendous celebration that was attended by thousands of guests.  Recent activities  In December 2008, Triwa Rinpoche and the monks of Sershul Monastery participated in a community film initiative, organized by the Kham Film Project.http://www.khamfilmproject.org/ In 2009, Triwa Rinpoche was invited by Rigdzin Namkha Gyatso Rinpoche and Tromthog Rinpoche to visit Europe. During this first visit in Europe, Triwa Rinpoche visited and taught hundreds of students at the Rigdzin Community in Switzerland, Dzogchen Ling in the Netherlands and Chokhor Ling in Spain, as well as Rigpa's Lerab Ling at the request of Sogyal Rinpoche.

The animation represents one possible homotopy. The homotopy analysis method (HAM) is a semi-analytical technique to solve nonlinear ordinary/partial differential equations. The homotopy analysis method employs the concept of the homotopy from topology to generate a convergent series solution for nonlinear systems. This is enabled by utilizing a homotopy-Maclaurin series to deal with the nonlinearities in the system. The HAM was first devised in 1992 by Liao Shijun of Shanghai Jiaotong University in his PhD dissertation and further modified in 1997 to introduce a non-zero auxiliary parameter, referred to as the convergence-control parameter, c0, to construct a homotopy on a differential system in general form. The convergence-control parameter is a non-physical variable that provides a simple way to verify and enforce convergence of a solution series. The capability of the HAM to naturally show convergence of the series solution is unusual in analytical and semi-analytic approaches to nonlinear partial differential equations.  Characteristics The HAM distinguishes itself from various other analytical methods in four important aspects. First, it is a series expansion method that is not directly dependent on small or large physical parameters. Thus, it is applicable for not only weakly but also strongly nonlinear problems, going beyond some of the inherent limitations of the standard perturbation methods. Second, the HAM is a unified method for the Lyapunov artificial small parameter method, the delta expansion method, the Adomian decomposition method, and the homotopy perturbation method. The greater generality of the method often allows for strong convergence of the solution over larger spatial and parameter domains. Third, the HAM gives excellent flexibility in the expression of the solution and how the solution is explicitly obtained. It provides great freedom to choose the basis functions of the desired solution and the corresponding auxiliary linear operator of the homotopy. Finally, unlike the other analytic approximation techniques, the HAM provides a simple way to ensure the convergence of the solution series. The homotopy analysis method is also able to combine with other techniques employed in nonlinear differential equations such as spectral methods and Pad√© approximants. It may further be combined with computational methods, such as the boundary element method to allow the linear method to solve nonlinear systems. Different from the numerical technique of homotopy continuation, the homotopy analysis method is an analytic approximation method as opposed to a discrete computational method. Further, the HAM uses the homotopy parameter only on a theoretical level to demonstrate that a nonlinear system may be split into an infinite set of linear systems which are solved analytically, while the continuation methods require solving a discrete linear system as the homotopy parameter is varied to solve the nonlinear system.  Applications  In the last twenty years, the HAM has been applied to solve a growing number of nonlinear ordinary/partial differential equations in science, finance, and engineering. For example, multiple steady-state resonant waves in deep and finite water depth were found with the wave resonance criterion of arbitrary number of traveling gravity waves; this agreed with Phillips' criterion for four waves with small amplitude. Further, a unified wave model applied with the HAM, admits not only the traditional smooth progressive periodic/solitary waves, but also the progressive solitary waves with peaked crest in finite water depth. This model shows peaked solitary waves are consistent solutions along with the known smooth ones. Additionally, the HAM has been applied to many other nonlinear problems such as nonlinear heat transfer, the limit cycle of nonlinear dynamic systems, the American put option, the exact Navier‚ÄìStokes equation, the option pricing under stochastic volatility, the electrohydrodynamic flows, the Poisson‚ÄìBoltzmann equation for semiconductor devices, and others.  Brief mathematical description  An isotopy of a coffee cup into a doughnut (torus). Consider a general nonlinear differential equation : \\\\mathcal{N}[u(x)] = 0 , where \\\\mathcal{N} is a nonlinear operator. Let \\\\mathcal{L} denote an auxiliary linear operator, u0(x) an initial guess of u(x), and c0 a constant (called the convergence-control parameter), respectively. Using the embedding parameter q ‚àà [0,1] from homotopy theory, one may construct a family of equations, : (1 - q) \\\\mathcal{L}[U(x; q) - u_0(x)] = c_0 \\\\, q \\\\, \\\\mathcal{N}[U(x;q)], called the zeroth-order deformation equation, whose solution varies continuously with respect to the embedding parameter q ‚àà [0,1]. This is the linear equation : \\\\mathcal{L}[U(x; q) - u_0(x)] = 0, with known initial guess U(x; 0) = u0(x) when q = 0, but is equivalent to the original nonlinear equation \\\\mathcal{N}[u(x)] = 0, when q = 1, i.e. U(x; 1) = u(x)). Therefore, as q increases from 0 to 1, the solution U(x; q) of the zeroth-order deformation equation varies (or deforms) from the chosen initial guess u0(x) to the solution u(x) of the considered nonlinear equation. Expanding U(x; q) in a Taylor series about q = 0, we have the homotopy-Maclaurin series : U(x;q) = u_0(x) +\\\\sum_{m=1}^{\\\\infty} u_m(x) \\\\, q^m. Assuming that the so-called convergence-control parameter c0 of the zeroth-order deformation equation is properly chosen that the above series is convergent at q = 1, we have the homotopy-series solution : u(x) = u_0(x) + \\\\sum_{m=1}^\\\\infty u_m(x). From the zeroth-order deformation equation, one can directly derive the governing equation of um(x) : \\\\mathcal{L}[u_m(x) - \\\\chi_m u_{m-1}(x) ] = c_0 \\\\, R_m[u_0, u_1, \\\\ldots, u_{m-1}], called the mth-order deformation equation, where \\\\chi_1 = 0 and \\\\chi_k = 1 for k > 1, and the right-hand side Rm is dependent only upon the known results u0, u1, ..., um ‚àí 1 and can be obtained easily using computer algebra software. In this way, the original nonlinear equation is transferred into an infinite number of linear ones, but without the assumption of any small/large physical parameters. Since the HAM is based on a homotopy, one has great freedom to choose the initial guess u0(x), the auxiliary linear operator \\\\mathcal{L}, and the convergence- control parameter c0 in the zeroth-order deformation equation. Thus, the HAM provides the mathematician freedom to choose the equation-type of the high- order deformation equation and the base functions of its solution. The optimal value of the convergence-control parameter c0 is determined by the minimum of the squared residual error of governing equations and/or boundary conditions after the general form has been solved for the chosen initial guess and linear operator. Thus, the convergence-control parameter c0 is a simple way to guarantee the convergence of the homotopy series solution and differentiates the HAM from other analytic approximation methods. The method overall gives a useful generalization of the concept of homotopy.  The HAM and computer algebra  The HAM is an analytic approximation method designed for the computer era with the goal of \\"computing with functions instead of numbers.\\" In conjunction with a computer algebra system such as Mathematica or Maple, one can gain analytic approximations of a highly nonlinear problem to arbitrarily high order by means of the HAM in only a few seconds. Inspired by the recent successful applications of the HAM in different fields, a Mathematica package based on the HAM, called BVPh, has been made available online for solving nonlinear boundary-value problems . BVPh is a solver package for highly nonlinear ODEs with singularities, multiple solutions, and multipoint boundary conditions in either a finite or an infinite interval, and includes support for certain types of nonlinear PDEs. Another HAM-based Mathematica code, APOh, has been produced to solve for an explicit analytic approximation of the optimal exercise boundary of American put option, which is also available online .  Frequency response analysis for nonlinear oscillators  The HAM has recently been reported to be useful for obtaining analytical solutions for nonlinear frequency response equations. Such solutions are able to capture various nonlinear behaviors such as hardening- type, softening-type or mixed behaviors of the oscillator,. These analytical equations are also useful in prediction of chaos in nonlinear systems.

Snapvine monetized its product by selling banner ads, as well as voice ads users must hear as a prerequisite to making and sending their own recordings to other social media users. According to TechCrunch, the company's competitors in 2007 were SayNow, Jangl, and Jaxtr. After experiencing a viral growth among Myspace users, the company was acquired by the company Whitepages for $20 million in 2008. Whitepages founder and CEO Alex Algard said he intended to combine Snapvine's functionality with Whitepages, a site people used to obtain the contact information of people with whom they have lost contact. Algard hoped that when people searched for themselves online, they would find their Whitepages profile. They could then substitute their phone numbers with newly created Snapvine voicemail accounts, allowing users not to have to disclose their phone numbers. The majority of Snapvine's 25 employees were expected to join Whitepages at Whitepages' Seattle office after the acquisition. Snapvine ceased its operations on March 31, 2010.

The mall was developed by the Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation. The mall's anchors at the time of its 1989 opening were JCPenney, Sears, Hess's, and Leggett. The mall has approximately 70 stores, four anchors (Burlington Coat Factory, Cinemark Theatres, JCPenney, and Target), several eateries at the mall's food court including one restaurant: Big Woody's (located at the mall's main entry). The mall was previously owned by Simon Property Group until it spun off numerous properties to Washington Prime Group in 2014. March 2016, Jones Lang LaSalle owns and manages the property. In April 2018, Koderides aquiered the mall for 12 million. The mall now features Bath and Body Works, Claire‚Äôs, DTLR, Foot Locker, The Children‚Äôs Place, Rack Room Shoes, Finish Line, Lids, New York And Company, at&t;, Mrs. Fields Cookies, Kay Jewelers, FYE, Jimmy Jazz, Men‚Äôs Wearhouse, Kids Foot Locker, LensCrafters, and Victoria‚Äôs Secret. History The mall was built and opened in October 1989 in former forest and swamp land of the Western Branch section of Chesapeake. Later, the business district grew with two other shopping centers including the adjacent \\"Chesapeake Center\\" as well as \\"The Crossroads at Chesapeake Square\\" across the street. After Montgomery Ward, which opened in 1992, closed in 2001, its building was expanded for use by Target. On May 9, 2009, it was reported that Dillard's shuttered their Chesapeake Square Mall locations in 2009 along with four other undisclosed locations. On July 27, 2009, Dillard's announced that it will close the two Chesapeake Square locations, laying off or transferring 45 employees. Early September 2009, the Men's building (originally Leggett until 1996, later Belk until 1998) had closed and items were moved to the Women's building (originally Hess's until 1993, later Proffitt's until 1997) until September 23 in which the store had closed as well. Announced in May 2010, Burlington Coat Factory replaced the former Dillard's Men's building in October 2010. The new store opened on September 24, 2010. The Gap closed its store in 2012 and was replaced by a Toys \\"R\\" Us Express which is now vacant. On November 12, 2010, the mall announced that the Cinemark movie theater moved to the former Dillard's Women/Hess's anchor space in with possible lifestyle stores and restaurants. The theater has stadium seating with twelve screens, including an Extreme Digital (XD) auditorium and opened at December 16, 2011. As of December 2017, the old Cinemark building has been demolished. Sears announced the closure of its Chesapeake Square store in late 2014. Macy's, which opened as Hecht's in 1999, announced the closing of its store by early 2016. This leaves JCPenney as the last original anchor since the mall's opening. American Eagle Outfitters, Aeropostale and Gymboree closed in 2016. Stride Rite and Hallmark closed in 2017. Bourbon St. Grill and El Angel Mexican closed in 2017 as well. Tilted Kilt, Regis Salons, and Chick-fil-a closed in 2018. Auntie Anne‚Äôs Pretzels and Meddateranian Roots Restaurant opened in late 2018. Things Remembered announced its closing in February 2019. HP Music & Arts opened on February 9, 2019.

Most scholars think Paul actually dictated his letters to a secretary, such as Tertius named in . Paul the Apostle has been placed within Second Temple Judaism by recent scholarship since the 1970s. A main point of departure with older scholarship is the understanding of Second Temple Judaism, the covenant with God and the role of works, as a means to either gain, or to keep the covenant. A central concern for Paul was the inclusion of Gentiles into God's New Covenant, and the role of faith and commandments in the inclusion of Gentile converts. Paul did not deem circumcision necessary, as witnessed throughout his writings, but thought that God included Gentiles into his New Covenant through faith in Christ. This brought him into conflict with some Jewish Christians, who requested strict observances of the Jewish law by Gentile Christians. Eventually the less strict view prevailed, and led to the separation of Gentile Christianity from Judaism.  Overview  Paul's influence on Christian thinking is considered to be more significant than that of any other New Testament author. According to Krister Stendahl, the main concern of Paul's writings on Jesus' role, and salvation by faith, is not the individual conscience of human sinners, and their doubts about being chosen by God or not, but the problem of the inclusion of Gentile (Greek) Torah-observers into God's covenant.Stephen Westerholm (2015), The New Perspective on Paul in Review, Direction, Spring 2015, Vol. 44 (No. 1), pp. 4‚Äì15. Paul draws on several interpretative frames to solve this problem, but most importantly, his own experience and understanding. The kerygma from refers to two mythologies: the Greek myth of the noble dead, to which the Maccabean notion of martyrdom and dying for ones people is related; and the Jewish myth of the persecuted sage or righteous man, c.q. the \\"story of the child of wisdom.\\" The notion of 'dying for' refers to this martyrdom and persecution. 'Dying for our sins' refers to the problem of Gentile Torah-observers, who, despite their faithfulness, are not Jewish by birth, and are therefore 'sinners', excluded from God's covenant. Jesus' death and resurrection solved this problem of the exclusion of the Gentiles from God's covenant, as indicated by . The inclusion of Gentiles into Judaism posed a problem for the Jewish-Christian identity of some of the proto-Christians, since the new converts did not follow all the tenets of the Mosaic Law; circumcision in particular was regarded as a token of the membership of the Abrahamic covenant, and the most traditionalist faction of Jewish Christians (i.e., converted Pharisees) insisted that Gentile converts had to be circumcised as well. Paul objected strongly to the insistence on keeping all of the Jewish commandments, considering it a great threat to his doctrine of salvation through faith in Jesus. According to Paula Fredriksen, Paul's opposition to male circumcision for Gentiles is in line with the Old Testament predictions that \\"in the last days the gentile nations would come to the God of Israel, as gentiles (e.g., ), not as proselytes to Israel.\\"Larry Hurtado (December 4, 2018), ‚ÄúWhen Christians were Jews‚Äù: Paula Fredriksen on ‚ÄúThe First Generation‚Äù For Paul, Gentile male circumcision was therefore an affront to God's intentions. According to Larry Hurtado, \\"Paul saw himself as what Munck called a salvation-historical figure in his own right\\", who was \\"personally and singularly deputized by God to bring about the predicted ingathering (the ‚Äúfullness‚Äù) of the nations ().\\" For Paul, the sacrifice of Jesus solved the problem of the exclusion of Gentiles from God's covenant, since the faithful are redeemed by participation in Jesus' death and rising. According to and Acts chapter 15, Paul discussed the issue with the leaders of the Jerusalem ekklƒìsia, agreeing to allow Gentile converts exemption from most Jewish commandments, which opened the way for a much larger Christian Church, extending far beyond the Jewish community. Hurtado notes that Paul valued the linkage with \\"Jewish Christian circles in Roman Judea\\", which makes it likely that his Christology was in line with, and indebted to, their views. Hurtado further notes that \\"[i]t is widely accepted that the tradition that Paul recites in must go back to the Jerusalem Church.\\" = New Perspective on Paul = E. P. Sanders introduced a new perspective on Paul with his 1977 publication Paul and Palestinian Judaism.Paul and Palestinian Judaism 1977 SCM Press According to Sanders, Western theology has misunderstood the Judaic context of Paul's religious views. Law-keeping and good works were not means to enter the covenant (legalism), but a sign of being in, and a means of keeping, the covenant. Sanders called this pattern of religion \\"covenantal nomism\\". Sanders' perspective calls the traditional Protestant understanding of the doctrine of justification into serious question. Sanders' publications, such as Paul and Palestinian Judaism in 1977 and Paul, the Law, and the Jewish People in 1983, have since been taken up by Professor James D. G. Dunn, who coined the phrase \\"New Perspective on Paul\\";J.D.G. Dunn's Manson Memorial Lecture (4.11.1982): 'The New Perspective on Paul' BJRL 65 (1983), 95‚Äì122. and N. T. Wright,New Perspectives on Paul Anglican bishop of Durham. Wright notes the apparent discrepancy between Romans and Galatians, the former being much more positive about the continuing covenantal relationship between God and his ancient people than the latter. Wright contends therefore that works are not insignificant. According to Wright, Paul distinguishes between works which are signs of ethnic identity, and those which are a sign of obedience to Christ. Within the last three decades, a number of theologians have put forward other \\"New Perspectives\\" on Paul's doctrine of justification, and even more specifically on what he says about justification by faith. According to Simon Gathercole, \\"Justification by faith\\" means God accepts Gentiles in addition to Jews, since both believe in God. Paul writes in his letter to the Romans, \\"For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law. Is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith\\". Faith is the central component of Paul's doctrine of justification ‚Äî meaning that Gentiles don't need to become Israelites when they convert to Christianity, because God is not just the God of one nation, but Gentile and Jew alike.Gathercole Simon, \\"What Did Paul Really Mean?\\" (Christianity Today, 2007) Sources The Book of Acts contains an account of Paul's travels and deeds, his conflicts with Greeks and Jews during the Julio-Claudian dynasty, and his interactions with the original Apostles of Jesus. The value of the historical information in Acts, however, is challenged by some scholars. They believe that it was written from a perspective of reconciliation between Pauline Christianity and its opponents, so portrays Paul as a Law-abiding Jew and omits his dispute with Peter, only briefly mentioning the split with Barnabas. Irenaeus in the 2nd century was the first of record to quote Acts, and he used it against Marcion of Sinope, who rejected the Hebrew Bible entirely (see also Marcionism). Paul's backgroundJewish background= Mediterranean Basin geography relevant to Paul's life in the first century, stretching from Jerusalem in the lower-right to Rome in the upper-left. Paul was from a devout Jewish family based in the city of Tarsus,Wright, G. Ernest, Great People of the Bible and How They Lived, (Pleasantville, New York: The Reader's Digest Association, Inc., 1974). one of the largest trade centers on the Mediterranean coast.Montague, George T. The Living Thought of St. Paul, Milwaukee: Bruce Publishing Co. 1966. It had been in existence several hundred years prior to his birth. It was renowned for its university. During the time of Alexander the Great, who died in 323 BC, Tarsus was the most influential city in Asia Minor. Paul's family had a history of religious piety ().1st Timothy, 2nd Timothy, and Titus may be \\"Trito-Pauline\\", meaning they may have been written by members of the Pauline school a generation after his death. Apparently the family lineage had been very attached to Pharisaic traditions and observances for generations; Acts quotes Paul referring to his family by saying he was \\"a Pharisee, born of Pharisees\\". In he states that two of his relatives, Andronicus and Junia, were Christians before he was and were prominent among the Apostles. Acts says that he was an artisan involved in the leather or tent-making profession. This was to become an initial connection with Priscilla and Aquila, with whom he would partner in tent-making and later become very important teammates as fellow missionaries. Paul referred to himself as an observant Jew in the letter to the Philippians: While he was still fairly young, he was sent to Jerusalem to receive rabbinical education at the school of Gamaliel, one of the most noted rabbis in history. Some of his family may have resided in Jerusalem, since later the son of one of his sisters saved his life there. Nothing more is known of his biography until he takes an active part in the martyrdom of Stephen, a Hellenised diaspora Jew. Although we know from his biography and from Acts that Paul could speak Hebrew, modern scholarship suggests that Koine Greek was his first language.Frederick Fyvie Bruce (1977), Paul, Apostle of the Heart Set Free, p. 43Dale Martin (2009), Introduction to New Testament History and Literature, lecture 14: \\"Paul as Missionary\\". Yale University. In his letters, Paul drew heavily on his knowledge of Stoic philosophy, using Stoic terms and metaphors to assist his new Gentile converts in their understanding of the Gospel and to explain his Christology. =Greek background= Alexander's empire, c. 334‚Äì323 BC, stretching east and south of Macedonia. Hellenistic Judaism was a movement which existed in the Jewish diaspora and the Holy Land that sought to establish a Hebraic-Jewish religious tradition within the culture and language of Hellenism. The major literary product of the contact of Judaism and Hellenistic culture is the Septuagint (begun in the 3rd century BC). Major authors are Philo of Alexandria (died c. 50 AD), Josephus (died c.100 AD), and some would claim also Paul.Jewish Encyclopedia: Saul of Tarsus: Not a Hebrew Scholar; a Hellenist The decline of Hellenistic Judaism in the 2nd century AD is obscure. It may be that it was marginalized by, absorbed into, or became Early Christianity. Recently, Talmudic scholar Daniel Boyarin has argued that Paul's theology of the spirit is more deeply rooted in Hellenistic Judaism than generally believed. In A Radical Jew, Boyarin argues that Paul the Apostle combined the life of Jesus with Greek philosophy to reinterpret the Hebrew Bible in terms of the Platonic opposition between the ideal (which is real) and the material (which is false). Gentiles and circumcision Before Paul's conversion, Christianity was part of Second Temple Judaism. Gentiles who wished to join the early Christian movement, which at the time comprised mostly Jewish followers, were expected to convert to Judaism, which likely meant submission to adult male circumcision for the uncircumcised, following the dietary restrictions of kashrut, and more (see 613 mitzvot for details). During the time period, there were also \\"partial converts\\", such as gate proselytes and God-fearers. Paul insisted that faith in Christ (see also Faith or Faithfulness) was sufficient for salvation and that the Mosaic Law did not bind Gentiles. =Paul's conversion= Prior to his conversion, Paul says he was a Pharisee who \\"violently persecuted\\" the followers of Jesus. After his conversion, Paul's attitude changed dramatically, becoming an 'apostle to the Gentiles', who envisioned a New Covenant in which both Jews and Gentiles would partake. =Pillars of the Church= Paul made explicit in that he did not discuss with the \\"Pillars of the Church\\" after he had received his revelation to be an apostle, that he saw no one except Cephas (Peter) and James, when he was in Jerusalem three years after the revelation and implies he did not explain his gospel to them until 14 years later in a subsequent trip to Jerusalem. =Proselytizing among Jews= According to Acts, Paul began working along the traditional Jewish line of proselytizing in the various synagogues where the proselytes of the gate (a biblical term. For example, see ) and the Jews met; and only because he failed to win the Jews to his views, encountering strong opposition and persecution from them, did he turn to the Gentile world after he had agreed at a convention with the apostles at Jerusalem to admit the Gentiles into the Church only as proselytes of the gate, that is, after their acceptance of the Noachian laws.,. In , Paul declares that, immediately after his conversion, he went away into Arabia, and again returned to Damascus. \\"Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas.\\" In Acts, no mention is made of Paul's journey into Arabia; and the journey to Jerusalem is placed immediately after the notice of Paul's preaching in the synagogues. Hilgenfeld, Wendt, Weiz√§cker, Weiss, and others allege here a contradiction between the writer of the Acts and Paul. R. Emden, in a remarkable apology for Christianity contained in his appendix to \\"Seder 'Olam\\"pp. 32b‚Äì34b, Hamburg, 1752 gives it as his opinion that the original intention of Jesus, and especially of Paul, was to convert only the Gentiles to the seven moral laws of Noah and to let the Jews follow the Mosaic law ‚Äî which explains the apparent contradictions in the New Testament regarding the laws of Moses and the Sabbath. =Persecution of Paul by Jews in Acts= Several passages in Acts describe Paul's missions to Asia Minor and the encounters he had with Diaspora Jews and with local gentile populations. In , the Jews from Antioch and Iconium go so far as to follow Paul to other cities and to incite the crowds there to violence against him. Paul had already been stoned and left for dead once. In Philippi, a Roman colony, Roman magistrates beat and jailed Paul and his companions on behalf of the Gentiles. Clearly at this point, Paul and his companions were still considered to be Jews by those in Philippi who raised protests against them, despite Paul's attempts to tailor his teachings to his audience. Later, in nearby Thessalonica, the Jews again incited the crowds and pitted the Christians against the Roman authority. =Circumcision controversy= Circumcision of Christ, sculpture in the Cathedral of Chartres. Paul, who called himself \\"the Apostle of the Gentiles\\", criticised the practice of circumcision, perhaps as an entrance into the New Covenant of Jesus. In the case of Timothy, whose mother was a Jewish Christian but whose father was a Greek, Paul personally circumcised him \\"because of the Jews\\" that were in town.McGarvey on Acts 16: \\"Yet we see him in the case before us, circumcising Timothy with his own hand, and this 'on account of certain Jews who were in those quarters.'\\" Some believe that he appeared to praise its value in , yet later in Romans 2 we see his point. In he also disputes the value of circumcision. Paul made his case to the Christians at Rome that circumcision no longer meant the physical, but a spiritual practice. And in that sense, he wrote: \\"Is any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised\\" in ‚Äîprobably a reference to the practice of epispasm.Catholic Encyclopedia: Circumcision: \\"To this epispastic operation performed on the athletes to conceal the marks of circumcision St. Paul alludes, me epispastho .\\" Paul was already circumcised at the time of his conversion. He added: \\"Is any called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised\\", and went on to argue that circumcision didn't matter: \\"Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts.\\" Later Paul more explicitly denounced the practice, rejecting and condemning those Judaizers who promoted circumcision to Gentile Christians. He accused them of turning from the Spirit to the flesh: \\"Are you so foolish, that, whereas you began in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?\\" Paul warned that the advocates of circumcision were \\"false brothers\\". He accused the advocates of circumcision of wanting to make a good showing in the flesh, and of glorying or boasting of the flesh. Paul instead stressed a message of salvation through faith in Christ opposed to the submission under the Mosaic Law that constituted a New Covenant with God, which essentially provides a justification for Gentiles from the harsh edicts of the Law, a New Covenant that didn't require circumcision (see also Justification by faith, Pauline passages supporting antinomianism, Abrogation of Old Covenant laws). His attitude towards circumcision varies between his outright hostility to what he calls \\"mutilation\\" in to praise in . However, such apparent discrepancies have led to a degree of skepticism about the reliability of Acts.For example, see Catholic Encyclopedia (1907‚Äì1914): Acts of the Apostles: Objections Against the Authenticity Baur, Schwanbeck, De Wette, Davidson, Mayerhoff, Schleiermacher, Bleek, Krenkel, and others have opposed the authenticity of the Acts; an objection is drawn from the discrepancy between and . Some believe that Paul wrote the entire Epistle to the Galatians attacking circumcision, saying in chapter five: \\"Behold, I Paul say unto you, if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.\\" The division between the Jews who followed the Mosaic Law and were circumcised and the Gentiles who were uncircumcised was highlighted in his Epistle to the Galatians: =Views on Judaizers= Paul was critical of \\"Judaizers\\" within the Church. This conflict between Paul and his opponents may have been the reason for the Council of Jerusalem. Here James, Paul, and the other leaders of the Early Christian movement agreed that Gentile converts needed only to follow the \\"three exceptions\\", (counted by some as four) laws that roughly coincide with Judaism's Seven Laws of Noah said to be established by God for all humankind. This Apostolic Decree, still observed by the Orthodox Church, is similar to that adopted by Rabbinic Judaism, which teaches that Gentiles need only follow the Noachide Laws to be assured of a place in the World to Come. See also Noahidism and Dual-covenant theology. =Council of Jerusalem= Paul seems to have refused \\"to be tied down to particular patterns of behavior and practice.\\" He does not engage in a dispute with those Corinthians who apparently feel quite free to eat anything offered to idols, never appealing or even mentioning the Jerusalem council. He rather attempts to persuade them by appealing to the care they should have for other believers who might not feel so free. Paul himself described several meetings with the apostles in Jerusalem, though it is difficult to reconcile any of them fully with the account in Acts (see also Paul the Apostle#Council of Jerusalem). Paul claims he \\"went up again to Jerusalem\\" (i.e., not the first time) with Barnabas and Titus \\"in response to a revelation\\", in order to \\"lay before them the gospel proclaimed among the Gentiles\\", them being according to Paul \\"those who were supposed to be acknowledged leaders\\": James, Cephas and John. He describes this as a \\"private meeting\\" (not a public council) and notes that Titus, who was Greek, wasn't pressured to be circumcised. However, he refers to \\"false believers secretly brought in, who slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might enslave us.\\" Paul claims the \\"pillars\\" of the ChurchCatholic Encyclopedia: St. James the Less: \\"Then we lose sight of James till St. Paul, three years after his conversion (A.D. 37), went up to Jerusalem. ... On the same occasion, the \\"pillars\\" of the Church, James, Peter, and John \\"gave to me (Paul) and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision\\". had no differences with him. On the contrary, they gave him the \\"right hand of fellowship\\", he bound for the mission to \\"the uncircumcised\\" and they to \\"the circumcised\\", requesting only that he remember the \\"poor\\". Whether this was the same meeting as that described in Acts is not universally agreed. According to an article in the Jewish Encyclopedia, great as was the success of Barnabas and Paul in the heathen world, the authorities in Jerusalem insisted upon circumcision as the condition of admission of members into the church, until, on the initiative of Peter, and of James, the head of the Jerusalem church, it was agreed that acceptance of the Noachian Laws ‚Äî namely, regarding avoidance of idolatry, fornication, and the eating of flesh cut from a living animal ‚Äî should be demanded of the heathen desirous of entering the Church.Jewish Encyclopedia: Gentiles: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah Since F.C. Baur, scholars have found evidence of various strands of thought within Early Christianity. James D. G. Dunn proposes that Peter was a \\"bridge- man\\" between the opposing views of Paul and James the Just. =Incident at Antioch= Rembrandt's Two old men disputing, 1628. This painting has been thought to depict Peter and Paul. Despite the agreement presumably achieved at the Council of Jerusalem as understood by Paul, Paul recounts how he later publicly confronted Peter, also called the \\"Incident at Antioch\\" over Peter's reluctance to share a meal with Gentile Christians in Antioch.Catholic Encyclopedia: Judaizers see section titled: \\"The Incident At Antioch\\" Writing later of the incident, Paul recounts: \\"I opposed [Peter] to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong\\". Paul reports that he told Peter: \\"You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?\\" Paul also mentions that even Barnabas (his travelling companion and fellow apostle until that time) sided with Peter.Catholic Encyclopedia: Judaizers: \\"On their arrival Peter, who up to this had eaten with the Gentiles, \\"withdrew and separated himself, fearing them who were of the circumcision,\\" and by his example drew with him not only the other Jews, but even Barnabas, Paul's fellow-labourer.\\" The final outcome of the incident remains uncertain. The Catholic Encyclopedia states: \\"St. Paul's account of the incident leaves no doubt that St. Peter saw the justice of the rebuke.\\"Catholic Encyclopedia St. Paul's account In contrast, L. Michael White's From Jesus to Christianity states: \\"The blowup with Peter was a total failure of political bravado, and Paul soon left Antioch as persona non grata, never again to return.\\" The primary source for the Incident at Antioch is Paul's letter to the Galatians. =Jews depicted as killers of Jesus= As noted by New Testament scholar Pieter Willem van der Horst, Paul accuses the Jews of killing Jesus and the prophets in : James P. Carroll, historian and former Catholic priest, cautions that this and similar statements in the Gospels of Matthew and John are properly viewed as \\"evidence not of Jew hatred but of sectarian conflicts among Jews\\" in the early years of the Christian church. Separation with Judaism Paul's theology of the gospel contributed to the separation of the messianic sect of Christians from Judaism, a development contrary to Paul's own intent. He wrote that faith in Christ was alone decisive in salvation for Jews and Gentiles alike, making the schism between the followers of Christ and mainstream Jews inevitable and permanent. Without Paul's campaign against the legalists who opposed him, Christianity may have remained a dissenting sect within Judaism,Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. p. 331 for example see Noahidism. He successfully argued that Gentile converts did not need to follow Jewish customs, get circumcised, follow Jewish dietary restrictions, or otherwise observe Mosaic law, see also Antinomianism in the New Testament and Abrogation of Old Covenant laws. Nevertheless, in his Epistle to the Romans he insisted on the positive value of the Law (see also Pauline passages opposing antinomianism) in its divine form. Since Paul's time, the polemical contrast that he made between the old and the new way of salvation has usually been weakened, with an emphasis on smooth development (Supersessionism) rather than stark contrast (Marcionism). See also New Perspective on Paul. =Pauline Christianity= Pauline Christianity is a term used to refer to a branch of Early Christianity associated with the beliefs and doctrines espoused by Paul the Apostle through his writings. The term is generally considered a pejorative by some who believe it carries the implication that Christianity as it is known is a corruption of the original teachings of Jesus, as in the doctrine of the Great Apostasy.  Jewish views Jewish historical reconstructions= Jewish interest in Paul is a recent phenomenon. Before the so-called Jewish reclamation of Jesus (as a Jew) in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, he had hardly featured in the popular Jewish imagination and little had been written about him by the religious leaders and scholars. Arguably, he is absent from the Talmud and rabbinical literature, although he makes an appearance in some variants of the medieval polemic Toledot Yeshu (as a spy for the rabbis). But with Jesus no longer regarded as the paradigm of gentile Christianity, Paul's position became more important in Jewish historical reconstructions of their religion's relationship with Christianity. He has featured as the key to building barriers (e.g. Heinrich Graetz and Martin Buber) or bridges (e.g. Isaac Mayer Wise and Claude G. Montefiore) in interfaith relations, as part of an intra- Jewish debate about what constitutes Jewish authenticity (e.g. Joseph Klausner and Hans Joachim Schoeps), and, on occasion, as a dialogical partner (e.g. Richard L. Rubenstein and Daniel Boyarin). He features in an oratorio (by Felix Mendelssohn), a painting (by Ludwig Meidner) and a play (by Franz Werfel), and there have been several novels about Paul (by Shalom Asch and Samuel Sandmel). Jewish philosophers (including Baruch Spinoza, Leo Shestov, and Jacob Taubes) and Jewish psychoanalysts (including Sigmund Freud and Hanns Sachs) have engaged with the apostle as one of the most influential figures in Western thought. Scholarly surveys of Jewish interest in Paul include those by Hagner (1980), Meissner (1996), and Langton (2010, 2011).

Six species are found in eastern Australia and one in Western Australia. Description Plants in the genus Nematolepis are shrubs or small trees with their stems, leaves and sepals covered with shield-like scales. The leaves are simple and arranged alternately. The flowers are arranged singly or in cymes in leaf axils, and have five sepals, five partly overlapping petals and ten stamens, all free from each other in most species. The five carpels are free from each other, each with two ovules and the stigma is not differentiated from the style. The fruit usually has a single seed in each of the five follicles.

Originally published in the December 2004 edition of the now-defunct magazine USA Weekend,The Lump of Coal in USA Weekends official site it was re-released as a stand-alone book in 2008. It is meant to parody traditional children's Christmas stories, a la the 1823 poem Twas the Night Before Christmas. Though illustrated and relatively short, the book uses vocabulary above that of most children, including the term objets d'art. Many elements of the story are easily recognizable as Snicket- esque to Series of Unfortunate Events readers, including a culturally intelligent and talented protagonist who is dismissed by many a mumpsimus. Plot summary It is Christmas time. A living lump of coal falls off a barbecue grill. He wishes for a miracle to happen. The lump of coal is artistic and wants to be an artist. He goes in search of something. First, he finds an art gallery that, he believes, shows art by lumps of coal. But when he comes in, he sadly discovers the art is by humans who use lumps of coal. He then finds a Korean restaurant called Mr. Wong's Korean Restaurant and Secretarial School, but he goes in and discovers that all things used must be 100% Korean (although the owner does not use a Korean name or proper Korean spices). The lump of coal continues down the street and runs into a man dressed like Santa Claus. The lump of coal tells the man about his problem, and the man gets an idea. He suggests he put the lump of coal in Jasper (his bratty son)'s stocking. The son finds it and is ecstatic; he has wanted to make art with coal. So he makes portraits and he and the lump of coal become rich. They move to Korea and open an authentic Korean restaurant and have a gallery of their art.

Product category volume is a refinement of all commodity volume (ACV). It examines the share of the relevant product category sold by stores in which a given product has gained distribution.Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. . The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language in Marketing Project. Distribution metrics quantify the availability of products sold through retailers, usually as a percentage of all potential outlets. Often, outlets are weighted by their share of category sales or ‚Äúall commodity‚Äù sales. For marketers who sell through resellers, distribution metrics reveal a brand's percentage of market access. Balancing a firm's efforts in ‚Äúpush‚Äù (building and maintaining reseller and distribution support) and ‚Äúpull‚Äù (generating customer demand) is an ongoing strategic concern for marketers. Purpose Product category volume measures a firm's ability to convey a product to its customers in terms of total category sales among outlets carrying the brand. It helps marketers understand whether a given product is gaining distribution in outlets where customers look for its category, as opposed to simply high-traffic stores where the product may get lost in the aisles. When detailed sales data are available, PCV can provide a strong indication of the market share within a category to which a given brand has access. If sales data are not available, marketers can calculate an approximate PCV by using square footage devoted to the relevant category as an indication of the importance of that category to a particular outlet or store type. Construction Product category volume (PCV) is the percentage share (or dollar value) of category sales made by stores that stock at least one SKU of the brand in question, in comparison with all stores in their universe. :Product Category Volume (PCV) Distribution (%) = :100 x Total Category Sales of Outlets Carrying Brand ($) √∑ :Total Category Sales of All Outlets ($) :Product Category Volume (PCV) Distribution ($) = :Total Category Sales of Outlets Carrying Brand ($)  See also  *Numeric distribution *All commodity volume *Category performance ratio  References  External links  * MASB Official Website Category:Product management Category:Distribution (marketing) ","title":"Product category volume"},{"id":"22844617","text":"Frank Eyton (30 August 1894 ‚Äì 11 November 1962) was an English popular music lyricist best known for co-writing the lyrics of Johnny Green's \\"Body and Soul\\" (1930) with Edward Heyman and Robert Sour.[ Frank Eyton biography] at Allmusic - retrieved on 18 May 2009 Most of Eyton's work was collaborations with Noel Gay and Billy Mayerl in London-based musical theatre.

Since 1976, it runs for seven consecutive weekends through July and August and features music, comedy, and interactive theatre performances as well as the work of artisans and craftspeople. The COVID-19 pandemic caused the 45th festival to be cancelled in 2020; it was deferred to 2021. Setting The setting is the year 1585 in the fictional village of Warwick, which rambles across a wooded hillside and includes many permanent structures (some two-story) on the occasion of their annual festival. Queen Elizabeth is in attendance in the company of the members of her court, including various real-life historical figures, such as Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Francis Drake. These ladies and gentlemen of the court perform shows, such as the human chess match and Tea with the Queen, in addition to interacting with patrons. The entirety of village life is represented by the cast, known as the Wyldewood Players (formerly, the Bless-the-Mark Players). The cast of costumed actors portray all kinds of villagers; gypsies, pirates, washer- wenches and others. They stroll the grounds, improvising scenarios to entertain the patrons. Costumed entertainers include Renaissance musicians, bagpipers, illusionists, jugglers, sword-swallowers, fortune-tellers, and comedy acts. Twice daily the performers join together in a parade through the Festival grounds, and the Festival closes each evening with a pub sing in which everyone is encouraged to sing along. At the base of the west-facing hillside is the jousting field. Here, full-contact jousting takes place, as well as displays of archery and (on Highland weekend) Highland games. In addition, patrons can ride the war-horses of the jousters for a small fee. thumb AttractionsStage shows= Sterling has a paid cast known as the Wyldewood Players, as well as musicians, acrobats, acting troupes, sword- swallowers, comedy acts, roving players who interact with patrons, and many more (see \\"Performers\\" below for a partial listing). =Arts and crafts= Like most Faires, the Sterling Renaissance Festival has a large number of artisans and craftspeople, such as glass-blowers, blacksmiths, bookbinders, and potters. Other vendors and wares include leather and costuming shops, weapons, custom footwear, walking sticks, musical instruments, jewelry, toys, and woodworking. =Games= There are also a number of games of skill available for an additional fee, such as archery, axe-throwing, \\"Tomato Justice\\" (where participants pelt a man with ripe tomatoes), the Ladder of Truth, and the Pillow Fyte. Several human-powered rides are available. =Food= Various foods are available, including such Faire staples as turkey legs and shish-kabobs, but also including vegetarian items like portobello mushroom sandwiches and fresh fruit. The Rose & Crown Tavern (renamed in 2010 from the \\"Bad Dog Tavern\\") serves alcohol, including mead, and has a selection of meat pies, bacon-wrapped scallops, and other foods. In the past, the Tavern has featured live entertainment. =Themed weekends= Each weekend has a formal theme that will often inform the storyline acted out by the townsfolk. Current and past themes include Family Appreciation Weekend (discount tickets for families). Marketplace Weekend (purchases from vendors earn free tickets), Ale Fest Weekend, Highland Fling (Scottish music and competitions), Pirate Invasion, Romance Weekend, and Fantasy Weekend. =\\"Lost Warwick\\"= In the summer of 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of the regular season. In response, creative director Gary Izzo teamed up with members of the regular cast and independent performers to write, produce, and film an original six-episode story entitled \\"The Legend of Lost Warwick\\". The story follows the leading citizens of Sterling (the Lord and Lady Mayor, the Sheriff, and others) trying to plan for a pending visit from the Queen of England, when they realize that the entire village has mysteriously vanished. New installments aired weekly on Saturday afternoons during what would have been the festival's usual run (July 11 through Aug. 15), with previous episodes becoming available for on-demand streaming. There was also a live \\"Tavern Talk\\" episode on the preceding (Friday) evening. Each Saturday episode not only furthered the story, but also showcased artisans, musicians, and stage shows, and was interspersed with live discussion from the Warwick Inn featuring a different special guest. The show was filmed on the Festival grounds, and all profits went to Renaissance Entertainers Services and Crafters United (RESCU).\\"Sterling Renaissance Festival hosts virtual show to support performers, artisans\\", syracuse.com, 8 Jul 2020 Performers The Wyldewood Players, the oldest full-time professional acting troupe of any Renaissance Festival, comprise The Queen, her court, and the Warwick villagers (barber-surgeon, washer wenches, mud beggars, gravedigger, etc.). Entertainments include The Queen's Tea, Her Majesty's Daily Diversion, Trial & Dunke, and a daily Publick Execution. The Players' creative director Gary Izzo has more than 30 years' experience with interactive theatre, including with Disney theme parks, and is the author of The Art of Play: The New Genre of Interactive Theatre (Heinemann Drama, 1997) and Acting Interactive Theatre: A Handbook (Pearson Education, 1998). Other regular acts at the Fair include the following: Patron participation Many Fair attendees come in costume (\\"garb\\"), and booths inside the grounds offer garb for sale or rent. Renaissance, fantasy, pirate, and steampunk are favorite themes. In 2008, for the first time, peace-tied period weapons were permitted. Sterling has an active group of long-time season ticket-holders known as \\"Family of Faire\\", many of whom have developed their own characters and attend every weekend of the season.\\"A life more Medieval: Spending summers at the Sterling Renaissance Festival,\\" syracuse.com Ownership The Festival was founded in 1976 by Dennis Ouellette Sr., and later owned and operated by Gerald and Virginia Young for more than thirty years. In early 2008 the Fair was purchased by Doug Waterbury, who also owns an amusement park in Sylvan Beach and other entertainment venues in Central New York. Waterbury invested $2 million in the business. Several new stages were constructed and existing ones refurbished, and the number of performers was boosted for the 2008 season. Waterbury planned to use the site for additional events, and install a larger jousting theater which could also be used for outdoor concerts.Diana Louise Carter, \\"Sterling Renaissance Festival has renaissance of its own\\", Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, July 6, 2008 In popular culture Jamie Denbo, creator of Lifetime's American Princess, is a former Sterling cast member.

footballer who played in the Scottish Football League for Queens Park, Heart of Midlothian and Queen of the South, and in the Football League for Birmingham City. He played as a forward. Smith was born in Edinburgh. He studied medicine, and eventually qualified as a doctor, combining this with playing football on an amateur or semi-professional basis. He spent time with several clubs in both Scotland and England, playing league football only where it did not interfere with his medical career. While with Birmingham City, he scored regularly for the reserve team and was highly rated, but his work at the Queen Elizabeth Medical Centre restricted him to only two first-team appearances. His father, Jimmy, played professionally for Clyde and St Mirren in the 1930s, and his son, Matt, turned professional with Oldham Athletic in 2011. Notes A. Because Smith's football career was intermittent, the years in the infobox represent years or seasons when he was known to have played for or to have been registered with each team: Queen's Park, Birmingham City, Heart of Midlothian, Bromsgrove Rovers, and Queen of the South.

In 2005 Enr√≠quez-Ominami created and presided the ChileMedios Foundation, through which he developed several studies on local television audience behavior. He worked as professor of film production in Chilean and Peruvian universities and collaborated in political campaigns for Ricardo Lagos and Carlos Ominami in Chile and also in Peru and Mexico. Political career Enr√≠quez-Ominami with President of Brazil Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva. In December 2005 Enr√≠quez- Ominami was elected deputy for District 10 in central Chile for a period of four years. He obtained the highest vote in that district's history. As deputy he worked on the Science and Technology and Agricultural commissions, and presided the Investigating Commission on State-funded advertisement and the Special Commission on the study of the Chilean political regime. He has introduced around 150 bills, many of which have been approved. In December 2008, Enr√≠quez-Ominami said he was available to compete with Jos√© Miguel Insulza and Eduardo Frei in the Concertaci√≥n presidential primaries. However, after claiming the Concertaci√≥n leadership changed the primary rules in order to bar him from the process, Enr√≠quez-Ominami decided to run as an independent. With the financial support of businessman Max Marambio, he began the process of collecting nearly 36,000 signatures needed to register his independent candidacy. He made extensive use of social networking Internet sites for this effect. In June 2009 he resigned from the Socialist Party to meet the legal deadline. Despite being relatively unknown, Enr√≠quez-Ominami quickly rose in opinion polls, garnering 10% of support by April 2009, capturing the leftist electorate dissatisfied with the choice of Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei as the Concertaci√≥n candidate. For the parallel legislative elections, he launched his own list of candidates, which was split between independent candidates (including three lawmakers seeking reelection) and members of two minor parties that supported his candidacy: the Humanist Party and the Ecologist Party. He placed the strongest candidates in districts where Concertaci√≥n party-leaders were vying for seats. However, though he made a strong showing, Enr√≠quez-Ominami ultimately fell short and was eliminated in the first round of voting with 20.13% of the vote. His parliamentary list also failed to win any seats, obtaining a low 4% of the vote. After the election, he refused to endorse either candidate, saying \\"Eduardo Frei and Sebasti√°n Pi√±era are too much alike [...] They don't represent hope, nor change, nor the future.\\" On December 16, his economic advisor, Paul Fontaine, joined Pi√±era's runoff campaign. Nearly a week later another one of his economic advisors, Luis Eduardo Escobar, joined Frei's team. Finally, four days before the election Enr√≠quez-Ominami held a press conference where he said he was going to vote for the \\"candidate of the 29%,\\" meaning to vote for Frei, but maintaining his supporters were free to choose their own candidate. In the General Election of 2013, Enr√≠quez-Ominami competed for the Presidency of Chile for the second time, now representing the Progressive Party. This time he placed third obtaining only 10,98% of the votes. Enr√≠quez-Ominami also run for the Presidency of Chile in the General Election of 2017. He gathered 5,71% of the vote and placed sixth among 9 candidates. Works *Animales pol√≠ticos. Dialogos filiales. Enr√≠quez-Ominami, Marco; Ominami Pascual, Carlos. 2004.

History Bardwell Mill was built in 1823. It worked by wind until 1925 and then by a Blackstone oil engine until 1941. The mill was derelict in 1978 but was later purchased by James Waterfield, who completed the restoration of the mill in 1985. The mill was sold to Geoffrey and Enid Wheeler in July 1987. On 16 October 1987, the mill was tailwinded when one of the gears in the fantail drive system became disengaged. The result was that the windshaft sheared at the rear of the canister, bringing the sails crashing to the ground. Restoration work began again in 1989 but was hampered by limited funds. Geoffrey Wheeler died in 1995 and in 1997 The Friends of Bardwell Windmill was set up. English Heritage and St Edmundsbury Borough Council gave over ¬£73,000 towards the estimated cost of ¬£92,000 to restore the mill. The balance was to be raised by the Friends. A replacement cap, cast iron windshaft and fantail were fitted to the mill in 2004. Owing to rising costs, it was decided that the new sails would be constructed by volunteer labour. The first pair of sails were completed by late summer 2008 and fitted in late 2010.https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2062898 The second pair of sails were fitted in April 2012. Description The mill with sails, 2010 Bardwell Mill is a four storey tower mill. The beehive cap is winded by a fantail. When fitted, the four double Patent sails have a span of and are carried on a cast iron windshaft which was cast in 1989 (the original windshaft in the mill was cast in two pieces). The brake wheel is wood, driving a cast iron wallower carried on a wooden upright shaft. The wooden great spur wheel drives two pairs of overdrift millstones. A wooden crownwheel on the upright shaft drives a sack hoist.

Likely from a Semitic source. See Hebrew ◊ê◊î◊ú◊ô◊ù 'ahalim 'trees of lign' (SC), perhaps in turn from Dravidian ; alphabet : The ancient Greek word represents the first two letters of the Greek alphabet (alpha and beta). The Greeks got their alphabet from a Semitic source.

Ugaritic has qms 'garment' (AHD). That word is similar, and shows the same k>q pattern that the later Semitic loanwords show. But a Semitic origin for camisia is a minority position in scholarship.From Late-Antique Greek Œ∫Œ±ŒºŒØœÉŒπŒøŒΩ kamision, the word migrated to pre-classical Arabic (Q. 12:18-28, 93; also poetry) ŸÇŸÖŸäÿµ qami·π£ 'shirt' and to Ethiopic qamas and to Syriac (not earlier Aramaic) q√ªmisi√©. Jeffery's reference to Syriac is from Fraenkel (1886), 45; to \\"Ethiopic\\" from Josippon. Leslau [, 74] assumes also from Fraenkel that Arabic-speakers delivered these Greek and Syrian shirts to the Ethiopians. Fraenkel would imply, further, that these traders provided the Syrian spelling for these shirts.

Biography  In 1976, the nation of Vanuatu was the Franco-British New Hebrides Condominium. L√©y√© was one of the 2 foundeand the 2 first sident of the Union of New Hebrides Communities (UCNH), an indigenous French-speaking movement formed in response to the National Party, a nationalist movement dominated by anglophones. While the National Party, under the leadership of Walter Lini, advocated for a rapid move of the New Hebrides toward independence, the UCNH advocated a more gradual transfer of power from colonial authorities \\"in order to prepare this transition under better conditions.‚Äù The popularity of the National Party, however, led to the independence of the country (which became Vanuatu) in 1980. The UCNH became the Union of Moderate Parties, the main political opposition force. On 2 March 1994, L√©y√© was elected President of the Republic, a ceremonial and essentially symbolic role in this parliamentary republic. He was the first francophone to hold this position. On 12 October 12 1996, he was briefly kidnapped by members of the Vanuatu Mobile Force, the paramilitary national defense service, which was protesting against unpaid funding. He was released the same day. It is the ‚Äúonly coup in the country's history‚Äù. In 1995, he publicly opposed the resumption of French nuclear tests in the Pacific. He called on France's \\"duty [to] guarantee a healthy environment\\" in the Pacific. His prime minister, Maxime Carlot Korman, wished to maintain close and friendly relations with France, while himself also opposing nuclear tests. At the end of 1997, Maxime Carlot Korman, now a simple deputy, tabled a censure motion in Parliament in an attempt to dismiss the government of Prime Minister Serge Vohor. President L√©y√© spoke on November 27 at the request of Serge Vohor and dissolved the Parliament, preventing the vote on the motion. This decision was controversial. L√©y√© explained himself by saying that the repeated motions of censure in Parliament were a source of political instability, and that he acted in good conscience without his act in any way being dictated by the prime minister. The dissolution of the Parliament was at first invalidated by the judiciary, but the decision of L√©y√© was later confirmed and restored by the Court of Appeals on 9 January 1998. The early elections caused by this dissolution were lost by Serge Vohor; Donald Kalpokas of Vanua'aku Pati became the new prime minister. Jean-Marie L√©y√©'s presidential term expired on 2 March 2 1999. He was succeeded by John Bani.

In 1987, Zimmerman led the team to a 10‚Äì3 record and a third title. Upon expiration of his contract, he left Hopkins after compiling a 6‚Äì5 record in 1990. The reason he cited was the pressure associated with the high-profile position.Hopkins lacrosse coach Zimmerman steps down, The Washington Times, June 12, 1990. In total, Zimmerman's teams at Johns Hopkins posted a 73‚Äì15 record. Current Hopkins head coach Dave Pietramala spent his entire college playing career under Zimmerman, from 1986 to 1989.

After a 3‚Äì9 campaign in 1996, UMBC became the most improved team in the nation with a 9‚Äì3 record for the 1997 season. In 1998, the Retrievers delivered a major upset by beating, 12‚Äì8, then first-ranked Maryland, the eventual national championship runners-up. The victory helped UMBC secure its first ever berth in the NCAA tournament. In 1999, the Retrievers again made an appearance in the tournament. Zimmerman coached the South squad in the 2002 North-South Senior All-Star Game. In 2005, UMBC posted a 5‚Äì1 conference mark to achieve the America East regular season conference championship.

He was named the 2006 America East Coach of the Year. In 2007, UMBC again advanced past Binghamton before falling to Albany in the America East championship game, and secured another berth in the NCAA tournament. There, they upset seventh-seeded Maryland in the first round for the school's first appearance in the NCAA quarterfinals. In 2008, UMBC again faced Albany in the America East championship game.

Shortly after his marriage to Queen Noor, King Hussein instructed his brother to appoint Prince Ali (Hussein's eldest son from his marriage to Queen Alia) as his heir apparent. However, by 1992, Hussein changed his mind. Besides his own sons, the King seriously regarded his nephew, Prince Talal bin Muhammad, as his possible heir.

She then graduated from law school at Willamette University College of Law in 1969, earning a Juris Doctor from the Salem, Oregon, school. In law school she was one of only two women in her graduating class. While an undergraduate in college at the age of 22, the unmarried Ireland became pregnant with a daughter.McMahon, Patrick. \\"Adoptees' rights group gets support in Wash.\\", USA TODAY September 11, 2000, p. 2A. After discussing the situation with her parents, she went to a special home for single mothers in Colorado where she gave birth.Le, Phuong. \\"Faith Ireland says she had baby as teen\\", Seattle Post-Intelligencer, September 9, 2000, p.

Ireland put the baby up for adoption, in what she called \\"...one of the worst things that ever happened in my life\\" and \\"the hardest decision I've ever had to make in my life.\\" She later joined an adoption registry and re- united with her then adult daughter in 1997. Ireland chose to speak out about the adoption as a Justice, saying \\"I wanted to help reduce some of the shame around issues of adoption and let young people know that you can be a birth parent and still go on and have a successful career and a successful life.\\"Cook, Rebecca. \\"Supreme Court justice won't seek a second term\\", Associated Press, February 11, 2004. Legal career Ireland entered private legal practice in Seattle at the law firm of McCune, Godfrey and Emerick where she worked from 1970 until 1973. In 1974, she started her own single practitioner firm in Seattle's Pioneer Square neighborhood. Her firm, Faith Enyeart and Associates, handled legal issues from family law, personal injury, business law, tax, and criminal defense. While in private practice she returned to school and earned a master's of science degree in taxation from a satellite campus of Golden Gate University in Seattle in 1984, graduating with honors. During this time Ireland served on the board of the Washington State Trial Lawyer's Association and was one of the founding members of the Washington Women Lawyers. Judicial career In 1983, Ireland left private practice when she was appointed to the King County Superior Court by Governor John Spellman. Ireland won the subsequent election for a full term on the court, and was re-elected four times. In 1994, she ran for a seat on the Washington Supreme Court, the highest court in Washington. Ireland finished third, with Gerry L. Alexander winning the seat. While on the King County court she was dean of the Washington Judicial College. She spent six years on the superior court judge group's board of trustees and was president for one year of the group. Her further service included a position on the Board for Court Education, and as vice chairperson from 1996 to 1998 of the Board for Judicial Administration. In 1998, the Leadership Institute in Judicial Education awarded her a distinguished service award. Also that year she was also named Judge of the Year by the state trial lawyer's association.Paton, Dean. \\"A bench press on judicial stereotypes\\", Christian Science Monitor, February 9, 2000, USA p. 3. While on the court she changed her last name to Ireland. Ireland's mother's maiden name was Janice Marcia Ireland. In 1998, she ran a second time to join Washington's highest court in a bid to replace the retiring James M. Dolliver.\\"Ireland To Run Again For High Court\\", The Seattle Times, March 17, 1998. In the primary election she finished first out of seven candidates and faced James Foley in the November general election.Modie, Neil. \\"Judicial races less of a snooze, but choosing still tough\\", Seattle Post-Intelligencer, October 30, 1998, p. C10. Ireland defeated Foley in November and won a six-year term on the court.The Associated Press. \\"Ireland, Madsen win state high court races\\", The Oregonian, November 5, 1998, p. B2. With the election of Mary Fairhurst in 2002, Ireland became part of the only state Supreme Court at that time to have a majority of women.Modie, Neil. \\"Fairhurst win gives top court 5 women\\", Seattle Post-Intelligencer, November 19, 2002. In 2004, Ireland announced she would not seek re-election, and left the court at the end of her term on January 10, 2005. In 2005, she earned a certificate in mediation from the Pepperdine University School of Law and established a practice as a private mediator. Weightlifting Two weeks after her appointment to the bench in 1983, Ireland was rear ended in a car crash and injured her back.Varner, Lynne K. \\"500 pounds on the scales of justice: A judge goes to powerlifter nationals\\", Seattle Times, January 27, 2000. After several years of unsuccessful physical therapy, Ireland turned to weightlifting to attempt to permanently fix the back pain.Daigneau, Elizabeth. \\"Glimpses: Legal Form\\", Governing Magazine, May 2002, p. 15.Black, Graham. \\"At 59, she's high court's iron woman\\", Seattle Post-Intelligencer, January 26, 2002, p. A1. Ireland continued to lift and became a powerlifter, participating in competitions in the US, Europe, India, and South America. She has won five world championships, seven USAPL national championships, and holds 12 world records and 27 American records from three federations. Later years In May 2006, Ireland wrote the majority opinion in a case where the state and private parties had sued the state's largest teachers' union for failing to comply with Initiative 134.Roesler, Richard. \\"Justices to hear teachers lawsuit; WEA opponents challenge dues\\", Spokesman Review, January 10, 2007, p. A1. The initiative, passed in 1992, prohibited unions from spending dues collected by non-members on political issues without first getting their permission. In the opinion, Ireland (serving as justice pro tempore) wrote the law was unconstitutional as it was \\"too heavy an administrative burden\\" on the union to get permission from each non-member. Subsequently, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Washington court's decision in Davenport v. Washington Education Association.Davenport v. Wash. Educ. Ass'n., 551 U.S. 177 (2007). Ireland and fellow former justice Robert F. Utter sued the Building Industry Association of Washington (BIAW) in 2008 over allegations the BIAW had violated campaign finance laws in its support of Dino Rossi, the Republican candidate for governor.Mulady, Kathy. \\"Rossi deposition exposes bitter gubernatorial campaign\\", Seattle Post-Intelligencer, October 30, 2008, p. B1. Running against Democratic incumbent Christine Gregoire, Rossi was accused of encouraging the BIAW to raise campaign funds for him before he had officially announced his candidacy. Rossi denied he had done anything illegal and claimed he could not recall details of his meetings with BIAW members, and called the lawsuit \\"a political stunt\\" by his opponents (Ireland and Utter had both donated money to Gregoire). In 2015, the Washington Supreme Court allowed the citizen suit to proceed, and denied the defendant's summary judgment motion.https://caselaw.findlaw.com/wa-supreme-court/1690355.html In April 2016, the plaintiffs settled with BIAW for $582,000, plus a penalty fee to the State of Washington. Civic involvement Ireland lives in South Seattle with her husband, Chuck Norem, and works as a private mediator and appellate consultant. She is the member of several boards of directors for local community groups, and was named \\"Chinese Man of the Year\\" for her work to help build the Wing Luke Asian Museum, even though she is neither Chinese nor a man. Ireland served as Vice-Chair of the Sheriff's Blue Ribbon Panel which in 2006 recommended sweeping reforms for the King County Sheriff's Office.\\"Report of the King County Sheriff's Blue Ribbon Panel\\", September 11, 2006. Other positions in the legal community have included president of the local chapter of the American Judicature Society, member of the Council on Public Legal Education, chairperson of the Education Committee and member of the Appellate Judges Education Committee for the state supreme court, and the executive committee for the Council on Public Legal Education. Awards include being named as a distinguished alumni in 2000 at Willamette University, a woman of distinction by the Puget Sound Business Journal, and being awarded the Passing the Torch Award by the Washington Women Lawyers.

Among the hundreds of later recordings of this standard, the following are particularly notable. Freddy Martin and His Orchestra recorded a version in 1950. Sheet music for this version featuring Freddy Martin on the cover has the lyrics printed inside. It was recorded by Albert Nicholas (clarinet), with the Big Chief Jazz Band, in Oslo on August 29, 1955, and released on a 78-rpm record (Philips P 53038). Bing Crosby and Connee Boswell recorded a vocal version in September 1952 for use in Crosby's radio show broadcast on November 27, 1952. Decca Records mastered this for commercial release on November 17, 1952. The Pollack and Gilbert song is not to be confused with a 1909 song of the same name by Henry Creamer and Bert Williams.

Development In 1934 Osaviakhim (Society for assistance to aviation and chemical industry), and AVIAVnito (Aviation Department of Vnito, all union scientific and technical research organisation), opened a competition for designing and building a safe aeroplane. Nikitin designed a small biplane with tandem seating, I-type wide chord inter-plane struts, rubber shock-isolating engine mounts and small semi- balloon tyres. The fuselage was built up from welded 30KhGSA steel tubing with plywood covering and the wings were constructed from wood with fabric covering. The first prototype had a Licence-built Renault MV-4 inverted in- line engine, but later variants used M-11 or MG-11 radial engines. The NV-5 won the Osavaiakhim/ AVIAVnito competition in 1937 and was prepared for production, as the U-5, for Osaviakhim and UVVS. One U-5 was modified with a ShKAS machine gun under the starboard wing and four under-wing RS-82 rockets. The most significant variant of the U-5 was the LSh (Legkii Shtabno ‚Äì light staff aircraft), built in 1942 at the request of the Moscow Defence HQ, this aircraft was used operationally on liaison and special missions from Leningrad to the Caucasus mountains. With a much more powerful MG-31F engine, Polikarpov I-153 upper wing, enclosed cabin, toughened rear cockpit with bench seating for two and aluminium lining, the LSh had excellent STOL and range performance.

The festival falls on the first day of the month of Karkkidakam (timed against the Malayalam calendar), which coincides with the month of July. It involves a number of unadorned elephants being positioned amid a multitude of people for being worshipped and fed. Crowds throng the temple to feed the elephants. Every year of Aanayoottu, gaja pooja, is conducted. It is believed that offering poojas and delicious feed to the elephants is a way to satisfy Lord Ganesha‚Äîthe god of wealth and of the fulfillment of wishes.

The name ‚ÄòClapton‚Äô or ‚Äòfarm on the hill‚Äô is derived from the Old English words ‚Äòclop‚Äô, meaning a lump or hill, and ‚Äòton‚Äô, meaning a farm. For centuries the land was owned by the Bishops of London, and occupied by tenant farmers who grew hay and food for the City of London. The villages of Lower and Upper Clapton lay on either side of Clapton Lane, which later became the Lower and Upper Clapton Roads. Lying about halfway between the two villages was Clapton Pond, fed by a natural spring. This would have been used to irrigate the land, and supply water for the farmers and their animals. By the late 18th century Clapton had become a fashionable place to live, with many fine country houses built for the rich merchants of London. Huguenot and Jewish communities also moved into the area, helping to develop Clapton into a prosperous neighbourhood. In the 19th century Clapton turned from being a sleepy backwater into a bustling London suburb and many of its grand houses were demolished to provide land for new homes. This rapid growth was increased by the opening of Clapton railway station in 1872, and the arrival of the tramways. By the 1890s, the houses on Thistlewaite, Newick, Mildenhall and Millfields Roads had been built, supplying much needed housing for newcomers. Another view of Clapton Pond Despite the decline of Clapton's prosperity in the 1920s and 1930s, the first half of the 20th century saw Clapton Pond at its most glorious, a perfect setting for the unique buildings situated behind the pond - the 17th-century Bishop Wood's Almshouses, the late 18th-century Pond House and the two mid 18th-century houses. The pond and gardens have always served as a focal point for the people of Clapton, from the few farmers who worked the land hundreds of years ago, to the multi-cultural community living and working in Clapton in the 21st century, who use it for public events and as a place to relax. In recent years the Clapton Pond Neighbourhood Action Group has been working to renovate the pond.

The Bohemian Massif is situated to the right. The Bohemian Massif ( or ƒåesk√Ω masiv, or B√∂hmisches Massiv) is in the geology of Central Europe a large massif stretching over central Czech Republic, eastern Germany, southern Poland and northern Austria. It is surrounded by four ranges: the Ore Mountains (Kru≈°n√© hory, or Erzgebirge) in the northwest, the Sudetes (for example Krkono≈°e, Hrub√Ω Jesen√≠k) in the northeast, the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands (ƒåeskomoravsk√° vrchovina) in the southeast, and the Bohemian Forest (≈†umava) in the southwest.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/71591/Bohemian-Massif The massif encompasses a number of mittelgebirges and consists of crystalline rocks, which are older than the Permian (more than 300 million years old) and therefore deformed during the Variscan Orogeny. Parts of the Sudetes, Krkono≈°e in particular, stand out from the ordinary mittelgebirge pattern by having up to four distinct levels of altitudinal zonation, glacial cirques, small periglacial landforms and an elevation significantly above the timber line. Gentle hills in the Bavarian Forest, a typical landscape of the Bohemian Massif Geography The landscapes in the Bohemian Massif are mostly dominated by rolling hills. North of the river Danube the topography is characterized by gentle valleys and broad, flat ridges and hilltops. The highest peaks on the Czech-Austrian borderline are the Pl√∂ckenstein (Plech√Ω, 1,378 m) and Sternstein (1,125 m). The bedrock of acid gneiss and granite is weathered to brown soil (cambisols). In flat areas and valleys the groundwater had more influence on soil formation; in such places gley soils may be found too. As in the other Variscan mittelgebirges of Central Europe, the valleys are more irregular and less pronounced as in the relatively young fold and thrust belt of the Alps. The plateaus are orographically more similar in morphology. Water gaps in the Bohemian Massif are the Wachau, the Strudengau and the valley of the Danube from Vilshofen over Passau and the Schl√∂gener Schlinge till Aschach. = Geographical divisions = The Bohemian Massif in its broader sense can be subdivided as follows: * Northern mountains (Ore Mountains and Sudetes, from west to east) ** Ore Mountains ** Elbe Sandstone Mountains ** Upper Lusatia (including the Lusatian Highlands and Lusatian Mountains) ** Giant Mountains ** High Ash Mountains * Southwestern mountains (the Bohemian Forest in its wider sense) ** Upper Palatine Forest ** Bavarian Forest * South and southeastern foothills: ** Gratzen Mountains ** Austrian Gneiss and Granite Highland, the high and deeply incised truncated highlands of the Austrian M√ºhlviertel and Waldviertel including the Weinsberg Forest and Bohemian Forest in other areas. ** Bohemian-Moravian Highlands between Budweis and Br√ºnn * Smaller strips are also found south of the Danube: ** Dunkelsteinerwald and Hiesberg in the Wachau ** Neustadtler Platte in the Strudengau ** K√ºrnberg Forest near Linz ** Sauwald between Eferding and Passau ** Neuburg Forest in Bavaria's countryside around Passau GeologyTectonic subdivision= The internal tectonic structure of the Bohemian Massif was formed during the Variscan Orogeny. The Variscan Orogeny was a phase of mountain building and accretion of terranes that resulted from the closing of the Rheic Ocean when the two paleocontinents Gondwana (in the south) and Laurussia (in the north) collided. Most of the Bohemian Massif is often supposed to belong to a terrane called Cadomia or Armorica,Linnemann et al. (2008b) which also included the terranes of the Armorican Massif in western France. This supposedly formed a microcontinent that became sandwiched between the large continental masses north and south. The result of the Variscan Orogeny was that almost all continental mass became united in a supercontinent called Pangaea. From the Permian period onward the Variscan mountain belt eroded and became partly covered by younger sediments, with the exception of Variscan massifs like the Bohemian Massif. The basement rocks and terranes of the Bohemian Massif are tectonically part of three main structural zones, which differ in metamorphic degrees, lithologies and tectonic styles. This tectonic subdivision was formed during the Variscan Orogeny.A subdivision into Saxothuringian and Moldanubian zones was first introduced by Kossmat (1927). The usual subdivision described here can for example be found in Linnemann et al. (2008a) *The Saxothuringian Zone forms the northern parts of the massif. The northernmost part of the Saxothuringian Zone is the Mid-German Crystalline High, which is but rarely exposed in the Bohemian Massif. The northern boundary of this zone is assumed to be the Rheic suture which separates the former continental masses of Gondwana and Laurussia.Linnemann et al. (2007) *The Moldanubian Zone forms the central parts of the massif and has generally a higher grade than the Saxothuringian Zone. It includes the Tepl√°- Barrandian Terrane, which is assumed to have been a small microcontinent. *The southeast of the massif forms a third unit, the Moravo-Silesian Zone. This zone includes the Brunovistulian Block, an allochthonous unit thrusted over the Moravo-Silesian crystalline rocks. Contradictionary to most parts of the Bohemian Massif, the Brunovistulian was originally part of or close to the southern part of Laurussia.Finger et al. (2000) linked the Brunovistulian terrane with \\"Avalonia\\" (i.e. the southern part of Laurussia) Resources Unlike other Variscan massifs in Central Europe the Bohemian Massif is not very rich in ores. The Harz Mountains further north in Germany, which are geologically part of the Rhenohercynian Zone, have more ore deposits. On the other hand, the Bohemian massif has many quarries where granite, granodiorite and diorite are won for use as decorative building stone.

Wireless RTLS tags are attached to objects or worn by people, and in most RTLS, fixed reference points receive wireless signals from tags to determine their location. Examples of real-time locating systems include tracking automobiles through an assembly line, locating pallets of merchandise in a warehouse, or finding medical equipment in a hospital. The physical layer of RTLS technology is usually some form of radio frequency (RF) communication, but some systems use optical (usually infrared) or acoustic (usually ultrasound) technology instead of or in addition to RF. Tags and fixed reference points can be transmitters, receivers, or both, resulting in numerous possible technology combinations. RTLS are a form of local positioning system, and do not usually refer to GPS or to mobile phone tracking. Location information usually does not include speed, direction, or spatial orientation. Origin The term RTLS was created (circa 1998) at the ID EXPO trade show by Tim Harrington (WhereNet), Jay Werb, (PinPoint), and Bert Moore, (Automatic Identification Manufacturers, Inc.(AIM)). It was created to describe and differentiate an emerging technology that not only provided the automatic identification capabilities of active RFID tags, but also added the ability to view the location on a computer screen. It was at this show that the first examples of a commercial radio based RTLS system were shown by PinPoint and WhereNet. Although this capability had been utilized previously by military and government agencies, the technology had been too expensive for commercial purposes. In the early 1990s, the first commercial RTLS were installed at three healthcare facilities in the United States, and were based on the transmission and decoding of infrared light signals from actively transmitting tags. Since then, new technology has emerged that also enables RTLS to be applied to passive tag applications. Locating concepts RTLS are generally used in indoor and/or confined areas, such as buildings, and do not provide global coverage like GPS. RTLS tags are affixed to mobile items to be tracked or managed. RTLS reference points, which can be either transmitters or receivers, are spaced throughout a building (or similar area of interest) to provide the desired tag coverage. In most cases, the more RTLS reference points that are installed, the better the location accuracy, until the technology limitations are reached. A number of disparate system designs are all referred to as \\"real-time locating systems\\", but there are two primary system design elements: =Locating at choke points= The simplest form of choke point locating is where short range ID signals from a moving tag are received by a single fixed reader in a sensory network, thus indicating the location coincidence of reader and tag. Alternately, a choke point identifier can be received by the moving tag, and then relayed, usually via a second wireless channel, to a location processor. Accuracy is usually defined by the sphere spanned with the reach of the choke point transmitter or receiver. The use of directional antennas, or technologies such as infrared or ultrasound that are blocked by room partitions, can support choke points of various geometries. =Locating in relative coordinates= ID signals from a tag is received by a multiplicity of readers in a sensory network, and a position is estimated using one or more locating algorithms, such as trilateration, multilateration, or triangulation. Equivalently, ID signals from several RTLS reference points can be received by a tag, and relayed back to a location processor. Localization with multiple reference points requires that distances between reference points in the sensory network be known in order to precisely locate a tag, and the determination of distances is called ranging. Another way to calculate relative location is if mobile tags communicate directly with each other, then relay this information to a location processor. =Location accuracy= RF trilateration uses estimated ranges from multiple receivers to estimate the location of a tag. RF triangulation uses the angles at which the RF signals arrive at multiple receivers to estimate the location of a tag. Many obstructions, such as walls or furniture, can distort the estimated range and angle readings leading to varied qualities of location estimate. Estimation-based locating is often measured in accuracy for a given distance, such as 90% accurate for 10 meter range. Systems that use locating technologies that do not go through walls, such as infrared or ultrasound, tend to be more accurate in an indoor environment because only tags and receivers that have line of sight (or near line of sight) can communicate. Applications RTLS can be used numerous logistical or operational areas such as: * locate and manage assets within a facility, such as finding a misplaced tool cart in a warehouse or medical equipment * notification of new locations, such as an alert if a tool cart improperly has left the facility * to combine identity of multiple items placed in a single location, such as on a pallet * to locate customers, for example in a restaurant, for delivery of food or service * to maintain proper staffing levels of operational areas, such as ensuring guards are in the proper locations in a correctional facility * to quickly and automatically account for all staff after or during an emergency evacuation **Toronto General Hospital is looking at RTLS to reduce quarantine times after an infectious disease outbreak. After a recent SARS outbreak, 1% of all staff were quarantined, and more accurate data regarding who had been exposed to the virus could have reduced the need for quarantines. * to automatically track and time stamp the progress of people or assets through a process, such as following a patient's emergency room wait time, time spent in the operating room, and total time until discharge. Such a system can be used for process improvement * clinical-grade locating to support acute care capacity management Privacy concerns RTLS may be seen as a threat to privacy when used to determine the location of people. The newly declared human right of informational self-determination gives the right to prevent one's identity and personal data from being disclosed to others, and also covers disclosure of locality, though this does not generally apply to the workplace. Several prominent labor unions have come out against the use of RTLS systems to track workers calling them \\"the beginning of Big Brother\\" and \\"an invasion of privacy\\". Types of technologies used There is a wide variety of systems concepts and designs to provide real-time locating. * Active radio frequency identification (Active RFID) * Active radio frequency identification - infrared hybrid (Active RFID-IR) * Infrared (IR) * Optical locating * Low-frequency signpost identification * Semi-active radio frequency identification (semi-active RFID) * Passive RFID RTLS locating via Steerable Phased Array Antennae * Radio beacon, * Ultrasound Identification (US-ID) * Ultrasonic ranging (US-RTLS) * Ultra-wideband (UWB) * Wide-over-narrow band * Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN, Wi-Fi) * Bluetooth, * Clustering in noisy ambience, * Bivalent systems A general model for selection of the best solution for a locating problem has been constructed at the Radboud University of Nijmegen. Many of these references do not comply with the definitions given in international standardization with ISO/IEC 19762-5 and ISO/IEC 24730-1. However, some aspects of real-time performance are served and aspects of locating are addressed in context of absolute coordinates. Ranging and angulating Depending on the physical technology used, at least one and often some combination of ranging and/or angulating methods are used to determine location: * Angle of Arrival (AoA) *Angle of Departure (AoD) (e.g. Bluetooth Direction Finding, features a mobile-centric RTLS architecture) * Line-of- sight (LoS) * Time of arrival (ToA) * Multilateration (Time difference of arrival) (TDoA) * Time-of-flight (ToF) * Two-way ranging (TWR) according to Nanotron's patents * Symmetrical Double Sided ‚Äì Two Way Ranging (SDS-TWR) * Near-field electromagnetic ranging (NFER) Errors and accuracy Real-time locating is affected by a variety of errors. Many of the major reasons relate to the physics of the locating system, and may not be reduced by improving the technical equipment. ;None or no direct response Many RTLS systems require direct and clear line of sight visibility. For those systems, where there is no visibility from mobile tags to fixed nodes there will be no result or a non valid result from locating engine. This applies to satellite locating as well as other RTLS systems such as angle of arrival and time of arrival. Fingerprinting is a way to overcome the visibility issue: If the locations in the tracking area contain distinct measurement fingerprints, line of sight is not necessarily needed. For example, if each location contains a unique combination of signal strength readings from transmitters, the location system will function properly. This is true, for example, with some Wi-Fi based RTLS solutions. However, having distinct signal strength fingerprints in each location typically requires a fairly high saturation of transmitters. ;False location The measured location may appear entirely faulty. This is a generally result of simple operational models to compensate for the plurality of error sources. It proves impossible to serve proper location after ignoring the errors. ;Locating backlog Real time is no registered branding and has no inherent quality. A variety of offers sails under this term. As motion causes location changes, inevitably the latency time to compute a new location may be dominant with regard to motion. Either an RTLS system that requires waiting for new results is not worth the money or the operational concept that asks for faster location updates does not comply with the chosen systems approach. ;Temporary location error Location will never be reported exactly, as the term real-time and the term precision directly contradict in aspects of measurement theory as well as the term precision and the term cost contradict in aspects of economy. That is no exclusion of precision, but the limitations with higher speed are inevitable. ;Steady location error Recognizing a reported location steadily apart from physical presence generally indicates the problem of insufficient over-determination and missing of visibility along at least one link from resident anchors to mobile transponders. Such effect is caused also by insufficient concepts to compensate for calibration needs. ;Location jitter Noise from various sources has an erratic influence on stability of results. The aim to provide a steady appearance increases the latency contradicting to real time requirements. ;Location jump As objects containing mass have limitations to jump, such effects are mostly beyond physical reality. Jumps of reported location not visible with the object itself generally indicate improper modeling with the location engine. Such effect is caused by changing dominance of various secondary responses. ;Location creep Location of residing objects gets reported moving, as soon as the measures taken are biased by secondary path reflections with increasing weight over time. Such effect is caused by simple averaging and the effect indicates insufficient discrimination of first echoes. StandardsISO/IEC= The basic issues of RTLS are standardized by the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission, under the ISO/IEC 24730 series. In this series of standards, the basic standard ISO/IEC 24730-1 identifies the terms describing a form of RTLS used by a set of vendors, but does not encompass the full scope of RTLS technology. Currently several standards are published: * ISO/IEC 19762-5:2008 Information technology -- Automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) techniques -- Harmonized vocabulary‚ÄîPart 5: Locating systems * ISO/IEC 24730-1:2014 Information technology -- Real-time locating systems (RTLS) -- Part 1: Application programming interface (API) * ISO/IEC 24730-2:2012 Information technology -- Real time locating systems (RTLS) -- Part 2: Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) 2,4 GHz air interface protocol * ISO/IEC 24730-5:2010 Information technology -- Real-time locating systems (RTLS) -- Part 5: Chirp spread spectrum (CSS) at 2,4 GHz air interface * ISO/IEC 24730-21:2012 Information technology -- Real time locating systems (RTLS) -- Part 21: Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) 2,4 GHz air interface protocol: Transmitters operating with a single spread code and employing a DBPSK data encoding and BPSK spreading scheme * ISO/IEC 24730-22:2012 Information technology -- Real time locating systems (RTLS) -- Part 22: Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) 2,4 GHz air interface protocol: Transmitters operating with multiple spread codes and employing a QPSK data encoding and Walsh offset QPSK (WOQPSK) spreading scheme * ISO/IEC 24730-61:2013 Information technology -- Real time locating systems (RTLS) -- Part 61: Low rate pulse repetition frequency Ultra Wide Band (UWB) air interface * ISO/IEC 24730-62:2013 Information technology -- Real time locating systems (RTLS) -- Part 62: High rate pulse repetition frequency Ultra Wide Band (UWB) air interface These standards do not stipulate any special method of computing locations, nor the method of measuring locations. This may be defined in specifications for trilateration, triangulation or any hybrid approaches to trigonometric computing for planar or spherical models of a terrestrial area. =INCITS= * INCITS 371.1:2003, Information Technology - Real Time Locating Systems (RTLS) - Part 1: 2.4 GHz Air Interface Protocol * INCITS 371.2:2003, Information Technology - Real Time Locating Systems (RTLS) - Part 2: 433-MHz Air Interface Protocol * INCITS 371.3:2003, Information Technology - Real Time Locating Systems (RTLS) - Part 3: Application Programming Interface Limitations and further discussion In RTLS application in the Healthcare industry, various studies were issued discussing the limitations of the currently adopted RTLS. Currently used technologies RFID, Wi-fi, UWB, all RFID based are hazardous in the sense of interference with sensitive equipment. A study carried out by Dr Erik Jan van Lieshout of the Academic Medical Centre of the University of Amsterdam published in JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Equipment) claimed \\"RFID and UWB could shut down equipment patients rely on\\" as \\"RFID caused interference in 34 of the 123 tests they performed\\". The first Bluetooth RTLS provider in the medical industry is supporting this in their article: \\"The fact that RFID cannot be used near sensitive equipment should in itself be a red flag to the medical industry\\". The RFID Journal responded to this study not negating it rather explaining real-case solution: \\"The Purdue study showed no effect when ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) systems were kept at a reasonable distance from medical equipment. So placing readers in utility rooms, near elevators and above doors between hospital wings or departments to track assets is not a problem\\". However the case of ‚Äùkeeping at a reasonable distance‚Äù might be still an open question for the RTLS technology adopters and providers in medical facilities. In many applications it is very difficult and at the same time important to make a proper choice among various communication technologies (e.g., RFID, WiFi, etc.) which RTLS may include. Wrong design decision made at early stages can lead to catastrophic results for the system and a significant loss of money for fixing and redesign. To solve this problem a special methodology for RTLS design space exploration was developed. It consists of such steps as modelling, requirements specification and verification into a single efficient process.

Biography Broz was born in Klanjec where he attended primary school, then moved to primary school in Vara≈ædin, and gymnasium in Karlovac, Po≈æega, and Zagreb, where he graduated. In Innsbruck, he started studying theology, but eventually abandoned it in order to study Croatian language, history, and geography at the newly established Croatian university in Zagreb. He served as a substitute teacher in Zagreb, and as a regular teacher in the upper secondary schools in Osijek, Po≈æega, and Zagreb. He received his PhD in 1888, attended Vatroslav Jagiƒá's lectures on Slavic studies in Vienna, and set off on a fieldwork journey across Bosnia and Herzegovina and southern Croatia, where he eventually grew ill, which was the cause of his death. Ivan Broz died in Zagreb. Work Croatian Orthography (Hrvatski pravopis), 1911 edition In 1885 in Matica hrvatska he was appointed the editor of Hrvatske narodne pjesme (Croatian folk songs). In his Crtice iz hrvatske knji≈æevnosti (two volumes) he gave an extensive overview of the oldest Croatian literary monuments. He authored a study on the Croatian imperative and numerous puristic articles (Filologiƒçke sitnice). In 1889 he was appointed to make a normative guide for Croatian. In 1892 he published his most important work, Hrvatski pravopis (Croatian Normative Guide), which was reprinted under the editorship of Dragutin Boraniƒá's until 1916. That normative guide, strictly based on Karad≈æiƒá-Daniƒçiƒá's normative conception, but formed chiefly upon the normative role model of the Croatian philologist Marcel Ku≈°ar, established the Croatian standard, with most of the later Croatian normative manuals in most of the prescriptions being but mere stylisations of Broz's ground-breaking work. Being the most moderate philologist among the Croatian \\"Vukovians,\\" Broz left a deep mark in the final standardisation of Croatian: thanks to him, there was no normative duality, which was threatened by the introduction of phonologically based spelling in Dalmatia and Bosnia (manual by Frane Vuletiƒá), and by the introduction of some rules from the normative standard of the Zagreb school (separate writing of the future tense, writing foreign names as in the original, avoiding voicing assimilation in most cases (podcijeniti, odƒçepiti, etc.), morphological forms in several cases (mladac/mladci, etc.)). He established firm ground for continuity with the older (chiefly Dubrovnik) normative tradition and secured a painless transition to the final normative form, avoiding a controversy like that which closely followed the linguistic interventions of his contemporary Tomislav Maretiƒá.

He had to be carried off the ground.In 1912 no replacements were allowed for injured players; however, an injured player who had left the field could return at any time. He returned to the field almost immediately, but did not stay long: :: \\"O'Shea now limped out [onto the field], and went in front of goal, but was overwhelmed in a wild surge, and had to be carried off once again\\". Displaying great courage, he returned to the field in the second half; restricted to the goal-square (he was unable to walk) he kicked the match-winning goal for Esendon, with his only kick: :: \\"O'Shea, who went out [once again] at half-time on the off-chance of doing something for his side ‚Äì but in the main to keeping a man away from where be would be doing the most harm ‚Äì marked the ball a few yards in front, and, nerving himself for the ordeal, he punted it through, and the game seemed safe\\". Many years later, the 1912 Essendon Coach, Jack Worrall spoke of the incident with great admiration for O'Shea's strong team-spirit, and exceptional courage: :: \\"One final in particular I will never forget Essendon was playing Carlton, there being no 19th man in those days. A minute after play began, Fred [O'Shea], Essendon's talented flanker, was carried off the field owing to an injured leg, and Essendon was in sore straits. I have never been a believer in playing injured men, and set my face against [O'Shea's] reappearance after half-time. Like all footballers of mettle [O'Shea] was anxious to reappear, feeling that he had let his side down. It was left for me to decide and I reluctantly agreed upon his re-entry on the distinct understanding that he was not to move away from the goal- mouth. It was not that anything was expected of him but that his mere presence on the field would prevent our opponents from having a loose man. In the dying moment Ernie Cameron broke his leg, and as the game hung in the balance it appeared as if Essendon was doomed. Cameron was a champion expert in any position though it was a rover that he stood head and shoulders above his confreres. As he was helpless on the ground he exhorted his comrades to see it out and leave him alone, and his advice acted like a tonic as his mates made one despairing effort for victory. In the stress the Carlton full-back left his post, being sick to death of minding a wounded man, and at the psychological moment the ball was marked by [O'Shea] on his own a few yards in front. He steadied himself, gave pressure on his wounded leg to see whether it would stand the strain, kicked the ball, staggered and fell. The bell rang and Essendon won the day by a few points. It was his only kick in the match and it won the premiership. Injured and all, he felt he had redeemed himself. Neither Cameron nor [O'Shea] ever played again.\\"Worrall, John, \\"Fifty Years of Football: Changes for the Better‚Äîor Worse?\\", The Argus, (Saturday, 3 October 1936), p. 30.

Joseph William McKay and Ovid Allard worked with Charles on these projects. In 1874 he was promoted to the grade of chief factor and placed in charge of the Victoria establishment. Later, in 1874, he was made inspecting chief factor of the western department, an important post, including in its jurisdiction all the Hudson's Bay establishments in and west of the Rocky mountains, retaining this position up to the time of his retirement in 1885, thereafter residing permanently in Victoria to the time of his death in 1903.

Louise is in love with him, but encourages her sister to marry him after finding out Georges is more interested in Frou-Frou. As suggested, Frou- Frou and Georges marry. Five years later, their four-year-old son celebrates his birthday. Georges is worried his wife is after all those years still youthful and flirtatious. Fearing she would be unable to give up her life style to become attached to the household, Georges asks Louise to teach her sister how to be a wife.

When she and Andre return to New Orleans, jealous ex-husband Georges challenges Andre to a duel. Everybody suspects Andre will win, but he is shot and killed.

Gone with the Wind was a huge success and a movie adaption was already in works. With Warner Bros. distributing Jezebel as well, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer knew they couldn't be left behind. A Civil War- themed film was rushed into production, eventually released as The Toy Wife.A Rose for Mrs. Miniver by Michael Troyan p. 78 The film starred Luise Rainer, an actress who was labeled as difficult to work with. She had become famous in a short period by winning two Oscars for her portrayal of Anna Held in The Great Ziegfeld (1936) and O-Lan in The Good Earth (1937). Suddenly, the public didn't care about her anymore and she angered studio head Louis B. Mayer by constantly demanding a higher salary.The Toy Wife: Overview Article TCM.com His reaction was casting her in B-films only, including The Toy Wife. There was a schedule conflict during the production, which forced director Richard Thorpe to withdraw from the direction of The Shopworn Angel (1938), a drama film starring Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart.Notes for The Toy Wife (1938) TCM.com There was a lack of a big budget. By casting Rainer, the studio couldn't afford a famous male lead and assigned Melvyn Douglas instead. Greer Garson was at one point considered for the role of Louise, but Rainer and Thorpe objected to the idea.A Rose for Mrs. Miniver by Michael Troyan p. 79 Reception Although the studio thought the film would be a hit, it became a flop. According to MGM records the film earned $557,000 in the US and Canada and $298,000 elsewhere resulting in a loss of $29,000. The Toy Wife was dismissed as a tearjerker and the plot was heavily criticized. Rainer received a lot of negative criticism, with The New York Times calling her portrayal \\"wound too tightly for anybody's comfort\\". The critic also noted she was being \\"too feminine\\". Neither she nor the studio was happy with the results. Rainer said her casting in this movie was a failed punishment, because she insisted she loved working with Douglas. Rainer was known for hating Hollywood and all the insiders, but described Douglas as a loving person, who was one of the few caring about more than acting.\\"Movies were always magical\\" by Leo Verswijver p. 144 Nevertheless, Rainer ended her contract with the studio the same year and retired from the film industry.

It was first described in 1759 by Carl Alexander Clerck, a Swedish entomologist. The type specimen is from Sweden. The foodplants of the larvae are poplars (Populus species) and willows (Salix species). Life cycle The wingspan is 14‚Äì19 mm, the colours are variable and the sexes are similar. They are on wing from June to September, depending on the location, and can be found on tree trunks, dislodged from foliage or swept from creeping willow (Salix repens). They also come to light. A similar species, A. blattariella is also a variable species and can only be told apart from A. populella by genitalia dissection. =Ovum= Eggs are laid on various species of poplar including aspen (Populus tremula) and willows, such as goat willow (Salix caprea) and white willow (Salix alba). =Larva= Rolled leaf in which the larva feeds Larvae can be found from mid-April to June. The head and divided prothoracic plate are black and the body is greyish green with round black pinacula which are easily seen, while the anal plate is brownish. The larva rolls a leaf into a tube, held together with silken strands which can be seen on the edges of the roll. On creeping willow, due to their small size several leaves are spun around the central shoot, starting a short distance below the tip and working upwards. Larvae of A. temerella also roll leaves around creeping willow. =Pupa= Pupation takes place in a cocoon within a rolled leaf of the foodplant.

Henry 'Harry' Morgan was born in Moreton Jeffries Rectory, Stoke Lacy, Herefordshire, where his father, Prebendary H. George Morgan, was the local curate, and spent his early years there along with his three younger sisters, Frieda, Ethel and Dorothy. He attended Marlborough School but suffered from poor health possibly caused by malnutrition and was withdrawn by his parents and sent to Italy to recover. On returning he went to the Crystal Palace School of Engineering in Sydenham London and then joined the Great Western Railway company as an apprentice. It was during this period that he survived a brake failure while driving a hired 3¬Ω hp Benz on a 1 in 6 gradient between Bromyard and Hereford. Paternal joy over his survival may have been slightly tempered by the resulting ¬£28 repair bill received by his father. In 1902 with the help of a gift from his godfather he bought his first car, a Star. He left the GWR in late 1904 and with his friend Leslie Bacon opened a motor sales and servicing garage in Malvern Link in May 1905 with agencies for Darracq and Wolseley cars. As well as this, he ran early bus services between Malvern Link and Malvern Wells, and later to Gloucester, with a Wolseley.Boddy, p.1410. The bus service was a failure, so Morgan switched to hire cars. In 1908, he bought a Peugeot twin cylinder engine intending to build himself a motor cycle, but changed his mind and used it to power his first car, which he made in 1909 with help from William Stephenson-Peach, the father of friends, and the engineering master at Malvern College, where Morgan was allowed use of the well equipped workshop.Morgan returns to Malvern College 100 years on . Malvern College official website. The three-wheel car had a backbone chassis, one seat, and coil spring independent front suspension, unusual at the time. With financial help from his father and his wife,Boddy, p.1411. the car was put into production at premises in Malvern Link adjacent to Chestnut Lodge, the house his father had bought him, and three single-seaters exhibited at the 1910 Motor Show at Olympia in London. In spite of great interest being shown, only a few orders were taken, and he decided that a two-seater was needed to meet the market demands. This was built in 1911, displayed at the 1911 Motor Cycle Show. An agency was taken up by the Harrod's department store in London, with a selling price of ¬£65. The Morgan became the only car ever to appear in a shop window at Harrods. As a way of boosting sales a policy of involvement in motor sport, often with Morgan himself driving (sometimes joined by his wife), was established. This began as early as 1912, when Morgan set out to win the trophy offered by The Light Car & Cyclecar for greatest distance covered in an hour, at Brooklands. The single-seater covered , only to be narrowly beaten by a GWK; Morgan returned later the same year, reaching nearly . Morgan also won the \\"very tough\\" ACU Six Days' Trial in 1913. Sales grew steadily up to the outbreak of World War I. Although some car manufacture continued, the factory was turned over mainly to munitions, and the factory was extended. Post-war the company prospered, and in 1921 HFS was able to buy a Rolls-Royce car, with body built by Morgan, and in 1925 moved to a larger house, Fern Lodge. HFS married a vicar's daughter, (Hilda) Ruth Day, in 1912. Their son Peter, born 1919, would in turn become chairman of the company.

He was awarded the Inolit Prize for Best Translation in 1987 (The Great Pursuit by Tom Sharpe). In 1976 Muravyov published a pioneering Russian article in the Soviet Union titled \\"Tolkien and Critics\\". Together with Andrey Kistyakovsky, he made the first official, though partial, Russian translation of The Lord of the Rings, published in 1982 with an introductory foreword. Muravyov continued the work after Kistyakovsky's death. Life Muravyov graduated from the philological faculty of the Moscow State University. He wrote two monographs on Jonathan Swift (1968, 1972) and several articles on modern English-American science fiction. He was working in the Soviet Library of Foreign Literature when he started the search for Western reviews of The Lord of the Rings.

In 1991 Muravyov translated The Two Towers and a year later The Return of the King. His transliteration was adapted for locations in The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar. Muravyov's The Two Towers was criticised for deviations and redundant Russification. Th√©oden was referred to as konung while marshal √âomer was titled the Third Seneschal of Mustangrim. Other examples include Tobold Hornblower translated as Tobold Thunderer (–ì—Ä–æ–º–æ–±–æ–π) and the river Entwash, transliterated as Ontawa (–û–Ω—Ç–∞–≤–∞). However it was outlined that Muravyov, avoiding similarities to the Russian word 'fool' (duren), transliterated Durin as Darin and Anduril as Andril. Many tolkienists do not share Muravyov's views on the etymology of hobbits, which he derives from the words homo and rabbit. Muravyov also translated the works of Washington Irving, O. Henry, F.

Construction began in 1929 http://www.airfields- freeman.com/MD/Airfields_MD_Balt_SE.htm#harbor with a seaplane base and was completed in 1941. It closed on 30 December 1960.

Today the former airfield is the site of the Dundalk Marine Terminal, a multi-use shipping facility of the Port of Baltimore.

The airport was planned as a replacement for the smaller Logan Field of the 1920s, which was next to the planned site of the new airport. It was built on an artificial peninsula built from dredged harbor silt alongside the old Colgate Creek on the \\"Patapsco Neck\\" peninsula (which ends and juts out into the Chesapeake Bay between the Patapsco River to the south and Back River (Maryland) in the north at Sparrows Point and North Point). Lower Colgate Creek flowed into the Patapsco River and is today the site of the Dundalk Marine Terminal facility of the Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore. A seaplane facility was opened by Pan American Airlines in 1932, and by 1937 Imperial Airlines began operation out of the airport (seaplane use subsequently declined, and by the end of the 1940s the seaplane facilities had fallen into disuse). Various airlines and \\"Pan Am\\" seaplanes (known as \\"Clippers\\") used the facility until World War II. Problems with the harbor silt led to lengthy delays and the facilities for land-based aircraft weren't ready for use until 1941. Civil traffic was suspended in 1942, when the United States Army Air Corps took over the airfield. The Army Air Corps used \\"Baltimore Army Airfield\\" as a I Fighter Command training airfield. Units assigned to the airfield were the 324th Fighter Group (6 July-28 October 1942); 353rd Fighter Group (26 October 1942 ‚Äì 27 May 1943), and the 358th Fighter Group (28 April-28 May 1943). Beginning in 1943, it was transferred to the Air Technical Service Command as a repair and maintenance sub-depot for the Middletown Air Depot, located near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill departed from \\"Baltimore Municipal Airport\\" on a 1942 British Overseas Airways Company (BOAC) flight (today it is \\"British Airways\\") after visiting President Franklin D. Roosevelt in what was at first, a secret trip to the White House in Washington, D.C. during the Christmas season for Allied consultations shortly after America entered the War following the Japanese sneak bombing raid at Pearl Harbor, in Hawaii on Sunday, December 7, 1941, and later in the Philippines at other American air and naval bases. The Prime Minister later met with reporters and addressed an unprecedented joint session of the United States Congress at The Capitol. BOAC continued to use Harbor Field as its main U.S. Operating Base during the war. BOAC \\"flying boat\\" service to Baltimore Municipal Airport ended in 1948. Civil airline service returned to \\"Baltimore Municipal Airport\\" in 1946. The airport's runways were not long and were limited to smaller planes. When Friendship International Airport (later Baltimore-Washington International Airport) opened in 1950, near Linthicum in suburban northern Anne Arundel County, airlines almost immediately moved to the new airport, which would later handle transcontinental jetliners. \\"Baltimore Municipal Airport\\" was officially renamed \\"Harbor Field\\" in 1950. During the 1950s \\"Baltimore Harbor Field\\" continued to serve private pilots and business aviation. It was also used as a Maryland Air National Guard (MDANG) base after the war. Beginning in 1946, the MDANG based its 104th Fighter Squadron at the airport. The squadron was originally equipped with piston-powered P-47 Thunderbolt aircraft, later replaced by F-51 Mustangs, but eventually the unit converted to the jet- powered F-86 Sabre. In 1957, the 104th relocated to the Glenn L. Martin Company Airport, of the former aircraft manufacturer Glenn L. Martin Company further to the east along Eastern Avenue in Middle River whose longer runways was necessary to support jet operations. In addition, the Maryland Air National Guard's 135th Air Commando Group was based at Harbor Field from 1955 until 1960, when it too relocated to the Martin Company Airport. That unit flew twin-engine C-46 Commando and SA-16 Albatross aircraft. In 1958 the airport was purchased by the recently constituted, old Maryland Port Authority of the State of Maryland for conversion into a marine terminal for port and maritime business and shipping, ending the use of the facility as an airport. The airfield was officially closed on 30 December 1960, following the departure of the last Air National Guard unit. Construction throughout the 1960s removed the runways and other airport structures, and by 1971 almost all physical evidence of the former city airport were gone. A 1990 historic site survey reported on four major structures from the \\"Airport Era\\" which were still extant: the old 1930's \\"Art Deco\\"-style Pan American terminal, the Air Station, Hangar #1, and the Air Guard Building. The Maryland Historical Trust subsequently earlier found these buildings to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, based on their innovative design features & their association with local transportation history. In 2005 the former control tower building, which had become derelict, was torn down. Unfortunately, by April 2013, it was reported by a local historical/nostalgia newspaper columnist in The Baltimore Sun, Frederick N. Rasmussen, that the iconic \\"Pan Am\\" Terminal that he had visited five years before had now been razed, and a substantial piece of Maryland's aviation history was lost. It is also known that somewhere on the grounds of the former \\"Logan Field\\", \\"Baltimore Municipal Airport\\" or \\"Dundalk Marine Terminal\\" along the shores of the lower Colgate Creek, was the original location of the first church building for St. Paul's Parish of the old Church of England, the established state church then of the colonial Province of Maryland, and one of the \\"Original Thirty\\" parishes designated for the Colony and the one for the newly \\"erected\\" (established) Baltimore County, founded in 1692, and the oldest church in either the County or the newly established \\"Baltimore Town\\" on the north shores of \\"The Basin\\" at the head of the Patapsco River. After 1706, when an official tobacco port had been established at Baltimore Town along Whetstone Point on the Northwest Branch of the River by authority of the General Assembly of Maryland for shipping and imports, there was enough that local citizens petitioned the legislature to lay out a town which was authorized in 1729 and followed the next year by an official \\"Original Survey\\" laying out lots of land. As the official Anglican Church for the County, it was decided to move the Parish to the new Baltimore Town, so Lot#19 was purchased from Charles Carroll of Annapolis in 1730 and construction of a new brick building (the first in Baltimore Town) was begun at the southeast corner of Forest (later North Charles Street) and St. Paul's Lane (later East Saratoga Street) on a cliff overlooking a bend to the east in the old Jones Falls stream.

The Coylton rocking stone Coylton Parish Church Notable people Professional footballers George Getgood (1892‚Äì1970) and David Affleck (1912‚Äì1984) were born in Coylton. Coylton was also home to one of Ayrshire's celebrated artists. Robert Bryden (1865‚Äì1939) was born in the village. After a period working in Ayr, he became a modeller of bronze busts which are highly regarded. Among his works are bronze portraits of William Wallace and Robert the Bruce in Ayr Town Hall. He also specialised in carved wooded figures, a collection of which are to be found at Rozelle. Bryden is also responsible for the Coylton War Memorial, a stone cross located near the church at the eastern end of the village.

These shops are located on the previous site of Murray's Garage, and the unit is aptly named Murray Park.  History  The Hamilton Aisle and archway at the old parish kirk, Low Coylton Coylton Old Manse Coylton is one of the smallest civil parishes in Ayrshire in geographical sense, but it boasted a sizeable population during the peak of the coal mining industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The parish historically includes the original settlement or Low Coylton, Upper Coylton (or Hillhead), Joppa, Craighall, Woodside and the village of Rankinston. The areas of Low Coylton, Hillhead, Joppa, along with contemporary housing estates such as Barngore and Highpark form today's Coylton village. The village is said to take its name from \\"Auld King Coil of Coilsfield\\" (Coel Hen) but old records have it spelt Quiltoun or Cuilton.Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland: A Survey of Scottish Topography, Statistical, Biographical and Historical, edited by Francis H. Groome and originally published in parts by Thomas C. Jack, Grange Publishing Works, Edinburgh between 1882 and 1885 http://www.scottish-places.info/parishes/parhistory962.html The village at the heart of the parish is almost linear, being spread along the length of the Ayr to Cumnock A70 road - which is used by the heavy trucks sustaining the modern open-cast coal mining industry. Low Coylton is the oldest part of the village, featuring the Coylton Arms and the few remains of an older life, such as the village cemetery and old kirk, a site of possibly medieval origins which was last repaired in 1776, along with the former manse dating from 1839, itself built on the site of an earlier manse. The current parish church, built in 1832, is located in Hillhead alongside houses that were miner's row houses in the late 19th century, more of which can be seen in Joppa. The modern village features a number of residential developments seeking to provide homes for people working in Ayr and district. Coylton was once a rural village that was transformed by the development of mining in the area and has since changed dramatically again with the cessation of all coal mining. The local farms, such as that at Duchray, have sustained some of Ayrshire's agricultural heritage. The village of Joppa was reputedly named for an ale-house kept by a man named Hendry. Local lore has it that he fed his customers with salt herrings which became known as \\"Joppa hams\\". The Castle and Barony of Gadgirth were located in the Parish of Coylton. The castle was demolished in 1808 and replaced by Gadgirth House which after becoming a children's home in 1949 was demolished in 1968.  Coylton and Burns  Datestone at Millmannoch Mill Trysting Thorn near Millmannoch An offshoot of the original Trysting Thorn, immortalised by Robert Burns in \\"The Soldier's Return,\\" has been moved from its original site to a spot farther from the road, by Coylton Burns Club. The thorn which is situated on the land of Millmannoch, near Coylton has romantic memories for many couples in the village, and even now the old meeting place of lovers is still a popular spot for ramblers. The original thorn, which, is known to have existed long before Burns was alive, died in 1916. The tree was left for two years in the hope that it would recover, but finally it was removed and Mr JP Wilson, an enthusiastic Burns fan, along with a few helpers, decided to nurture the shoots which began to grow up on the spot where the old thorn had grown. The shoots sprouted from haws which had fallen from the parent tree, and the strongest of these was chosen. This shoot flourished, but because it was so near the roadway, many people, instead of cutting sprigs from it, broke pieces off. This was gradually killing the tree and Coylton Burns Club finally decided that if the thorn was to be preserved it would require to be moved farther from the roadway and ring-fenced. This work was carried out by members of the Club. After the move was completed, a verse from \\"The Soldier's Return\\" was inscribed inside the railing. The ballad itself was written by Burns long after he left Ayrshire. His reference to the Trysting Thorn which occurs in the third verse is as follows: '' \\"At length I reach'd the bonnie glen Where early life I sported; I pass'd the mill, an' trysting thorn, Where Nancy aft I courted.\\" ''  Coylton Tennis Club  (See today's courts) A tennis club was started at Coylton in 1927-1928 by the young people of Coylton and play was suspended during the war years. In 1946-1947 the club was reactivated with one blaes court and the later addition of a clubhouse. Alex Murray (one of the four brothers who owned the local garage), an existing tennis club member, recalls playing tennis in the 1950s on this surface. At this time there was a fairly strong membership with roughly equal numbers of male and female members. National Service however meant that many young men were called up and limited information exists about the fate of tennis in Coylton which appears to have been suspended again in the 1960s. The present- day club was founded by the then local postmistress, Mrs Traynor, in 1979 after a lapse of many years. There was one all weather court and a few dedicated adults who negotiated with the local council to arrange playing times on the village court. Junior membership was built up with weekly coaching from Frank Paul and tournaments every Sunday, open to all the juniors in the village and run by Mrs E Ross. Gradually membership and enthusiasm increased and several members became coaches, enabling the club to offer their own junior and senior coaching sessions. In 1982 two new courts were added in Coylton by Kyle and Carrick District Council, replacing the older court. The club flourished with increased membership and coaches. Despite only having two courts, the club entered both gents and ladies teams in the Ayrshire league but had to obtain the use of a third court from a local caravan park, an annual present of a bottle of Scotch sealing the deal! The introduction of teams at junior level quickly followed with continued success. In the early 1990s, the small stone pavilion near the courts which was shared with the local football club was extended, by means of a donation from British Coal, to incorporate a small room enabling the club to entertain visiting teams. The main drawback was that this facility could not remain open for the use of members or the dissemination of information. In 1995, a new activity centre was built in Coylton on the site of the existing courts by South Ayrshire Council. The club benefitted by having three brand new courts complete with floodlighting, which are now leased from South Ayrshire Council. To complement these courts, the club purchased a portacabin as a clubhouse. In the last couple of years a more permanent structure has been built to serve as the clubhouse with all the required facilities. The club continues to flourish with five adult teams and a very strong junior section also participating locally with noted success. The club has managed to produce players at district, county and South of Scotland level and also one at national level, who has gone on to become a Scottish coach with Tennis Scotland.

All may be said to derive from the earlier local example of Melville Castle by James Playfair. Many of his works have been demolished. Life He was born in Ancrum, Roxburghshire the son of a carrier. After training as a joiner he moved to cabinet design, working then in London, and appears to have then trained as an architect before returning to Scotland to work in Edinburgh.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Elliot Archibald Elliot ran an architecture practice in London and Edinburgh with his brother James Elliot. Following James's death in 1810, Archibald ran the company on his own. It was later taken over by Archibald's son, Archibald Elliot Junior. He contributed to many significant buildings and streets in Edinburgh, including St Paul's and St George's Church, Rutland Square, the Regent Bridge, Waterloo Place and Calton Prison (now demolished). He was also involved with work on many country houses in Scotland, including Blair Castle and Taymouth Castle in Perthshire, Loudoun Castle in Ayrshire, and Stobo Castle in Peeblesshire. He is buried near the centre of New Calton Cemetery, close to his works on Waterloo Place. A son, William Elliot (1796-1828) lies with him. His younger brother, James Elliot (1770‚Äì1810), worked with him from 1800 until his early death. Archibald's sons, Archibald Elliot (died 1843) and Alexander Elliot, ran a practice in London.

History  Starting from 1941, the short 1.5x Zielfernrohr 41 (ZF41) telescopic sight was fitted to some Karabiner 98k rifles for designated marksman use. The ZF41 was the first attempt to provide the ordinary infantryman with a rifle capable of being used, if not for pure sniping, then at least for sharpshooting. It was initially planned to equip most combat units with the ZF41 scopes, but only 6% of German weapons production could fit the sight. Though useful for sharpshooting with normal infantry units, the design was generally rejected by sniper schools and disliked by snipers, because the 1.5x magnifying scope was deemed insufficient for shooting effectively at point targets over long distances. Problems were the scope's extreme eye relief, poor functioning in bad light and low magnifying power. Nonetheless, lack of better telescopic sights meant the ZF41 was used by snipers at the early stages of the war in the Eastern Front, but many snipers preferred captured Soviet rifles and custom-equipped German rifles with civilian scopes such as the vintage Gewehr 98. By the end of the war in 1945, more than 100,000 ZF41 scopes had been produced, the largest production of German optical sights during the war. Approximately 3,000 were marked ZF40, 29,000 were marked ZF41 (ZF40 and ZF41 later had this etched out and ZF41/1 added when they came back for service or repair) and the rest designated ZF41/1.  Use on other rifles  The G-41(m) and G-41(w) semi-automatic rifles had ZF40 scopes added in small quantities for test and evaluation in the field. MP-43, MP-44, FG-42 automatic select fire weapons had the ZF41/1 fitted for test only, these were not produced past prototype stage, the ZF4 scope was then used on these weapons instead. The Germans also produced a small amount of prototype and pre-production test batch of the G33/40 equipped with the ZF41. These were photographed for inclusion in the ZF41 manual in 1942. However the Brno factory switched over to the Karabiner 98k in 1943. Approximately 350 to 400 scoped G33/40 rifles were made in total. As of 2013 only one has been examined and found to be a real test batch scoped rifle: it is a late dot 1942 production rifle with serial number 3962C.

His style often uses photorealism as a means to a conceptual inquiry of fantastical content with an absurdist approach. He also uses several pseudonyms including Prof. Dr. Dr. Zagreus Bowery, publisher of the so-called \\"world's smallest magazine of its kind\\" Public Illumination Magazine. George W. Bush leading the war of terror, 2007  Art  Isaac has exhibited widely across the US and Europe. His work incorporates a range of media, from digital art to oil on canvas; he is particularly known for his installations, often incorporating sound and performance as well as panoramas and dioramic cabinets. In 2016 he created a major installation, titled 'Earthly Delights' of large-scale cut-out paintings, suspended in a re-purposed church, with a concurrent performance by Nyla van Ingen, Myriam Laplante, Daniela Malusardi and Dan Kinzelman. His exhibition 'Manifest Destinies' (2009) at C√† Zanardi, Venice, was part of an ambitious series of multi-site collateral shows of the 53rd Venice Biennale \\"Detournement Venise 2009\\", in a 2-story former cookie factory. It included monumental history paintings such as \\"Flotilla of Fools\\" depicting all 196 heads of state, wearing fool's hats, posing on shipwrecks. He created the animation for the 2007 performance of ‚ÄòIl Corvo‚Äô by the La Mama Experimental Theater Company at the 38th Biennale Teatro in Venice. In 1993 he had a solo exhibition at Galleria Marilena Bonomo in Bari, titled '93 Olives' and in 1994 a solo show at Salvatore Ala Gallery in Soho, NYC titled ‚ÄòSubway to Italy‚Äô. At the 1990 Spoleto Festival in Italy, he presented a 350¬∞ walk-in panorama of the Umbrian village Bazzano Superiore (later shown in Rome and Bari and currently held in the LeWitt Collection, Chester, CT, USA). It was installed in the geodesic dome in Spoleto known as the Spoletosfera, designed by Buckminster Fuller. With public funding from NYSCA, Isaac curated a series of exhibitions in a storefront gallery in Lower Manhattan named Public Illumination Picture Gallery. The two-year program (1982-1983) included work by David Wojnarowicz, Mimi Gross, Christian Marclay, Barbara Ess and Rudy Burckhardt amongst others. For the final exhibition he created an interactive multi-media installation titled 'Exhibition in a maze'.  Publishing  In 1984 his book \\"Twelve Picturesque Passions\\" was sponsored by Printed Matter, Inc, partially funded by a LINE grant. It was at this time that he met the American artist Sol LeWitt, one of the co-founders of Printed Matter, who later became a friend and neighbor. In 2017 an exhibition about Isaac's relationship with LeWitt was staged at the Chelsea College of Arts Library titled \\"Exchanges between Sol LeWitt and Jeffrey Isaac in Spoleto, Italy, and New York and Chester, Connecticut USA\\". It was curated by Jo Melvin, Reader in Fine Art, Archives and Special Collections at Chelsea College of Art. Since 1979 Isaac has published an artists' periodical, notable for its tiny size, called Public Illumination Magazine. Each issue has a unique theme with contributions by numerous artists using pseudonyms. Through 2017, sixty issues have been published. It is included in the collections of the New York Public Library, Museum of Modern Art, New York, Pompidou Center, Paris, and others.  Life  Born in the US, he spent his childhood in Switzerland before moving back to the United States where he studied painting at Rhode Island School of Design (B.F.A 1977) and at Camberwell School of Art in London (under the recommendation of Frank Bowling).

Produced by London Weekend Television for the ITV Network, the programme starred Elaine Stritch and Donald Sinden. Premise Dorothy McNab (Stritch) is a US author residing in London. As she spends most of her days writing, she hires an English butler, Robert Hiller (Sinden), to help run her Chelsea home. Being the epitome of the English gentleman, Robert does not approve of Dorothy's lurid thriller novels or her American ways. Much of the comedy stems from the banter between the two, as they continually disagree due to their cultural differences and often try to outwit each other. History Two's Company was created by Bill MacIlwraith, who also wrote all of the episodes. Although the first and second series were not simulcast nationally in the UK, the third and fourth series were shown in a primetime Sunday evening slot by all ITV stations. It was nominated for a BAFTA Award for \\"Best Comedy\\" programme in 1977,BAFTA Awards website (Two's Company) and was nominated for four BAFTA Awards in 1979, including \\"Best Comedy\\", \\"Best Graphics\\" (opening credits sequence) and Stritch and Sinden were each nominated for \\"Best Light Entertainment Performance\\". Stritch and Sinden also performed the series theme song, with lyrics written by Sammy Cahn and music by Denis King, which played during the animated opening credits sequence where Stritch's character is portrayed as a brassy American eagle and Sinden's as a snooty British lion. After its success in the UK, the series was remade for U.S. television in 1981 as The Two of Us starring Peter Cook and Mimi Kennedy, though this version was less successful and was cancelled the following year. Additionally, the original series was rerun on A&E; during the mid-1980s. Coincidentally, Stritch and Sinden died within two months of each other in 2014, aged 89 and 90 respectively.

They belong to the typical South African football fan's supporters gear, and are increasingly popular with fans of other sports. Sport fans spend hours to sculpt and paint their makarapa in the colours and emblem of their clubs or country. Besides the makarapa, fans also wear giant glasses or have shields with team slogans and logos. With the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the international profile and availability of the makarapa has increased greatly.  History  The origin of the term \\"makarapa\\" goes back to the start of mining in South Africa. The word makarapa literally meant \\"scrapers\\", referring to men who would leave the rural areas to go to the cities and \\"scrape\\" a living in mining and construction work. Upon returning they would be carrying or wearing the hard hats normally used by miners (the majority being migrant workers by Apartheid laws) and construction workers; eventually the term came to refer to the protective hats themselves. Makarapa were present in Z√ºrich at the selection of South Africa to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In September 2009 Sepp Blatter received a makarapa as a gift during a FIFA inspection. Makarapa is registered to Grant Nicholls and Trade Marked 2006/20971, expiring 4 Sept 2026.  Design  Makarapa are decorated to serve purposes such as being used as fan articles, an individual artwork as well as a means of promoting one's team brand in the stadiums as they attract a lot of media attention. They still also afford the wearer protection from missiles thrown at sporting matches, their original reason for being worn.

It was the first Roman Catholic church in the Canara region. Historically, this was the only parish church in Mangalore reserved for the high-caste Mangalorean Catholics. It is the oldest church in Karnataka. History The church of Our Lady of Rosary of Mangalore was originally the church of the old Portuguese factory. It was built by the Portuguese in 1568. Oral tradition states that the image of the Virgin Mary at the high altar was found by the fishermen at sea; when it got caught in their net. It was later brought to the church and installed there. The church was the main centre of devotion for the Bamonn caste who revered the image of Our Lady of the Rosary on the high-altar. It was mentioned by the Italian traveller Pietro Della Valle, when he visited Mangalore in 1623. The church was desecrated and destroyed by Mysorean ruler Tipu Sultan in 1784. Reconstruction of the church later began in 1813. In 1910, the structure of the old cathedral was demolished and the present cathedral erected in its place. The church of Our Lady of Rosary is the only church in the Mangalore Diocese which has a dome crowning the spacious sanctuary. The cross on the cathedral's dome was traditionally lit every night to serve as a beacon for seafarers. The Royal stone emblem of the Portuguese King marking their landing at Mangalore lies at the entrance of the church. In 1851, the Church of Our Lady of Rosary, Mangalore, was declared a Cathedral. In 1910, Henry Buzzoni a Jesuit priest started further beautification of the Cathedral. The formal dedication was done in 1915 by Bishop Paul Perini of Mangalore (1910‚Äì28). Structure The architect of the new cathedral was a Jesuit brother, Divo of Bombay. The structure consists of a series of matching arches, with 48 major arches, 12 central arches and 50 sub-arches. The peripheral verandah has around 45 small arches. The dome is a replica of the St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City, with heavy metal ribs, minor re-inforcements of metal, red brick & mortar water-proofed using indigenous techniques. In years gone by, the dome of the cathedral could be seen by ships approaching the Mangalore harbour, and was a beautiful sight.

Their marriage produced two children: a daughter, Elsie Isobel, and a son, who was also named Ken. Eather was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 53rd Infantry Battalion on 31 May 1923. He transferred to the 56th Infantry Battalion on 1 July 1925 and was promoted to captain on 23 February 1926, major on 27 November 1928, and lieutenant colonel on 1 July 1935. He commanded the 56th Infantry Battalion from 1 July 1933 to 31 July 1937 and then the 3rd Infantry Battalion from 1 August 1937 until 1 August 1938, when he was placed on the unattached list. Second World War Following the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Eather was chosen by Brigadier Arthur Samuel Allen to command the newly raised 2/1st Infantry Battalion, part of Allen's 16th Infantry Brigade. Eather enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and received the serial number NX3. His dental mechanic's practice was sold. The 2/1st Infantry Battalion was formed from recruits from Militia in the Sydney area and trained at Ingleburn Army Camp. In January 1940 it marched through Sydney and embarked for Palestine on the P&O; ocean liner SS Orford. Training continued in Palestine, with Eather emphasising mobile warfare rather than re-hashing the tactics of trench warfare from World War I, unlike some other battalion commanders with experience in that war. Eather attended the senior officers course at Middle East Tactical School in November and December 1940. He built a reputation as a disciplinarian, earning him the nicknames \\"28 days\\" and \\"February\\" (because it had 28 days) for his fondness for handing down sentences of 28 days' confinement to barracks ‚Äì the harshest penalty that regulations allowed. =Libya= In December 1940, the 2/1st Infantry Battalion was chosen to spearhead the attack on Bardia. Eather led from the front. For his part in the battle he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. His citation read: Eather went on to lead the 2/1st in the capture of Tobruk. Afterwards, however, he was hospitalised with pneumonia. He therefore missed the Battle of Greece, in which the 2/1st was nearly destroyed, with over 500 of its diggers taken prisoners. On resuming command, Eather was left to rebuild his battalion. From 18 June to 13 August 1941, Eather was acting commander of the 16th Infantry Brigade. On 27 December, he became commander of the 25th Infantry Brigade. This was part of the 7th Division, which was now commanded by Allen. On 8 February 1942, the 25th Infantry Brigade boarded the transport , initially bound for Java. It was diverted to Australia after Java was captured by the Japanese. In \\"recognition of gallant and distinguished services in the Middle East\\", Eather was mentioned in despatches. =Papua New Guinea ‚Äì Kokoda Trail, Buna, Gona= The 25th Infantry Brigade arrived in Adelaide on 10 March 1942. It was soon moving north east, first to Casino, New South Wales and then to Caboolture, Queensland. In August, it was ordered to Milne Bay. En route in the Australian Army transport Katoomba, it was diverted to Port Moresby to help stem the Japanese advance on that important Allied base over the Kokoda Trail. Eather's forces met the Japanese in the Battle of Ioribaiwa. Eather, in his first experience of jungle warfare, made a successful tactical retreat, the mode of fighting used by all Australian battalions throughout the whole of the first phase of the Kokoda Trail campaign (up until Eather's stalling of the Japanese column in sight of Port Moresby). By this tactic of withdrawing through the lines of other Australian units in defensive positions, to set up new defensive positions, the Australians of the raw militia battalions together with the hardened AIF battalions returned from the Middle East were able to avoid pincer assaults by the Japanese, who were in superior strength, while stretching Japanese supply lines to unsustainable lengths. His forces moved back to Imita Ridge, a naturally strong position, from which they held the Japanese to their southernmost land-based advance of the war, supported by battery of 25 pounders, which had been brought up the Track. While Imita Ridge had the disadvantage that it was the last defensive position on the Kokoda Trail before Port Moresby, the Japanese did not attack. Beset by logistical and health difficulties and hard pressed on Guadalcanal, they were forced to end their advance on the Kokoda Trail. Approving Eather's withdrawal, Allen told him that there could be no further withdrawal from Imita: \\"You'll die where you stand.\\" \\"Don't worry Tubby\\", Eather replied, \\"the only people who will die will be the Japs.\\" Thus began the long, hard reversal of pushing the Japanese back to the north coast from whence they had first come. Eather's force now began to push the Japanese back over the mountains, but slowly through the thick, slimy jungles. On 27 October, General Sir Thomas Blamey relieved Allen, replacing him with Major General George Alan Vasey, an officer that Eather distrusted, holding him responsible for the destruction of the 2/1st on Crete. In November, the 25th Infantry Brigade engaged the Japanese in the Battle of Oivi-Gorari. This time the outcome was very different from Ioribaiwa, and Eather won an important advance at low cost. Eather pressed on the coast, where the 25th Infantry Brigade encountered well-prepared Japanese positions in the Battle of Buna-Gona. Eather's men suffered heavy casualties from the enemy and tropical diseases, the 25th Infantry Brigade being almost wiped out. Eather's leadership at Gona was not as energetic as usual, perhaps because, like most of his men, he was malnourished and ill with malaria. Eather would suffer a series of relapses of the disease. Eather was awarded the United States Distinguished Service Cross \\"for extraordinary heroism in action in New Guinea, during the Papuan campaign, 23 July 1942, to 8 January 1943. As Commander 25th Infantry Brigade, Australian Army, Brigadier Eather displayed extraordinary courage, marked efficiency and precise execution of operations during the Papuan campaign\\". He was also appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. His citation read: =Papua New Guinea ‚Äì Lae= Australian troops file past a dead Japanese soldier on their way in to Lae. After a period of rest on the Atherton Tableland, the 25th Infantry Brigade returned to Port Moresby in July 1943. Following the landing at Nadzab by American paratroops, the brigade began to fly in to Nadzab. Due to the unpredictable weather, aircraft arrived at Nadzab sporadically and only the 2/25th Infantry Battalion and part of the 2/33rd had reached Nadzab by the morning of 8 September when Vasey ordered Eather to initiate the advance on Lae. As the diggers moved down the Markham Valley Road they occasionally encountered sick Japanese soldiers who held the column momentarily. Eather came up in his jeep and started urging them to hurry up. They were unimpressed. Eather, armed with a pistol, then acted as leading scout, with his troops following in a column of route behind him. The column entered Lae unopposed by the Japanese only to be strafed by the United States Fifth Air Force and shelled by Australian artillery. For his emphasis on speed, his troops nicknamed him \\"Phar Lap\\", after the famous race horse. For his part in the campaign in New Guinea, Eather was mentioned in despatches a second time. After Lae was liberated from Japanese occupation, 7th Division's Brigadier Eather set off by jeep to replace the Japanese flag on Mount Lunaman Voco Pointwith the Australian flag. =Borneo= In his next campaign in Borneo, however, Eather dispensed with speed in favour of a systemic advance making maximum use of firepower. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. His citation read: =New Britain= General Eather in Rabaul celebrating the 34th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China with Chinese troops on 10 October 1945 In July 1945, Blamey appointed Eather to command the 11th Division, with the rank of major general. The 11th Division was then engaged with the Japanese on New Britain. He was only in command for a few weeks however before Japan surrendered. Eather then became responsible for over 100,000 Japanese prisoners in the Rabaul area. He oversaw war crimes trials and their repatriation to Japan. =Victory March= In 1946, the British government decided to hold a victory parade through London, in which some 21 nations participated. Eather was chosen to head the Australian contingent of 250 servicemen and women, drawn from the three services. The Victory March Contingent sailed for the United Kingdom on on 8 April 1946 and marched through the city on 8 June 1946. On the return voyage sailors from the Shropshire and the troops of the Victory March Contingent started a riot in Gibraltar. Eather refused to lay any charges or offer an apology to the indignant British authorities. Later life Eather retired from the Army on 18 September 1946 and became a poultry farmer in Penrith, New South Wales. He became active in the Primary Producer's Association of New South Wales and was elected its president in 1953, a position he held for the next five years. However, the death of his son Ken in a motorcycle accident led him to reconsider life as a farmer. In 1958, he became the head of the Water Research Foundation of Australia, and organisation that dispensed funding to researchers investigating water related issues. Eather's wife Adeline died in 1966. In 1968 he married Kathleen Carroll. He treated Kathleen's son, Captain Owen Eather, an army officer and Vietnam War veteran, as his own son. Eather became concerned at the way Vietnam veterans were being treated by some veterans of the Second World War, and made a point of appearing at Anzac Day marches and RSL events with Owen. Eather continued to lead Anzac Day marches through Sydney until 1992. In his old age, Eather spent time with his grandson Eamon, who later joined the Australian Army Reserve and served with the International Force for East Timor. Eather died at a nursing home in Mosman, New South Wales on 9 May 1993. As the last surviving Australian general of the Second World War, he was given a military funeral at St. Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney. Three companies of the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment provided an honour guard and an oration was given by General Sir Francis Hassett. Some 1,000 veterans lined George Street, Sydney to pay their last respects to Eather, who was cremated at the Northern Suburbs Crematorium.

He was Chair of History of Eastern Asia at the University of Rome from 1955 to 1984. He was a student of the Italian explorer, academic, and scholar Giuseppe Tucci. Luciano Petech was born in 1914 and retired in 1984. He learned several European languages, including Latin, as well as Asian languages such as Tibetan, Chinese, Japanese, Newari, Sanskrit, Arabic, Hindi and Urdu. Biography A delegation from the Western Regions, seen in Beijing by Johan Nieuhof in 1656, who took them for emissaries of the Moghuls of India. Petech thinks the delegation are visitors from Turfan in Moghulistan instead.. Volume III, \\"A Century of Advance\\", Book Four, \\"East Asia\\", Plate 315. Lach and van Kley's source is Luciano Petech, \\"La pretesa ambasciata di Shah Jahan alla Cina\\", Rivista degli studi orientali, XXVI (1951), 124-127 Petech began his teaching career in India at 25 years old, as a reader in Italian at the University of Allahabad from 1938 to 1946. His first recorded article is for the Calcutta Review in 1939. His subject was the dramas and stories of the great Italian author Luigi Pirandello, who had recently died two years after being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. He says ‚Äúthe people‚Äù in Italy had unfairly turned their backs on the intellectual Pirandello as unrepresentative of the times (Petech 1939: 13) and as not speaking to their hearts (idem: 24). With the outbreak of World War II, as an Italian enemy alien in British India, Petech spent most of that time in a civil internment camp. Petech used this time to study Tibetan literature and write an article on the chronological system of the 15th-century Blue Annals of Tibet. Unlike Tucci, a staunch collaborator with the Fascist regime, Petech was apolitical. Petech returned to Europe in 1947,to temporary teaching appointments at the Istituto Orientale of Naples and University of Rome. For the next 8 years, he wrote 30 pieces of varying length on Asia, always focused on the meeting of different cultures from Asia or Europe, in areas bordering India. From 1955 to 1984, he held the chair of History of Eastern Asia in Rome University, publishing 14 books and over 80 articles on Asia. At the end of this period, the foreword to the anthology of his selected articles, made to mark his retirement, praised his ‚Äòobjective, calm and sensible judgment, his willingness to cooperate, and his learning‚Äô (Petech 1988: viii). These traits are evident in his many works. In his books on Ladakh, Nepal and Tibet from medieval to modern times, his approach has the outward appearance of ‚Äúhistory‚Äù‚Äîunimpeded by philosophy or superstition‚Äîunlocked through a serious and critical engagement with historical sources that are described before any of the events described in them. In his magisterial seven volume ‚ÄòI Missionari Italiani nel Tibet e nel Nepal, Petech made available a mine of contemporary missionary accounts which are still invaluable source materials. Petech‚Äôs monographs attempt to bring Himalayan history into the light of world history. This aim was always to be appreciated, and, as Herbert Franke noted in 1950 when Petech published ‚ÄúChina and Tibet in the early 18th century‚Äù, It may be considered as a fortunate coincidence... just now when the Chinese government tries to establish again its suzerainty over the land of snow because it will enable the reader to get a clear notion how the Chinese protectorate in Tibet came into being. (Franke 1950) These are sentiments with which many would thoroughly agree. However, Petech‚Äôs early attempts also tend to subsume unique events within western explanatory frameworks. In 1947 he wrote: > As to Ladakh, there is little to be said. It suffered the fate of all > countries which tried to build an empire without that indispensable > foundation, a sufficiently large population of the home country. (1988 > [1947]: 39) This attempt to universalise the process of empire-building also has politically loaded connotations in a time when Italy had just failed to regain the Roman Empire, thwarted by the dwindling imperial powers of Britain and France and the new empire, America. When he returned to the topic of Ladakh in 1977, he admitted that ‚ÄòI found my first effort hopelessly obsolete‚Äô (1977: xi). His second treatment is more nuanced, and he finally explains the collapse of Ladakhi power with more of an emphasis on economic overstretch (idem: 79). Central Tibet and the Mongols, Petech‚Äôs latest book-length study, is a more fluidly written narrative, character-led and more descriptive in tone. It is still authoritative, and has naturally overtaken Tucci‚Äôs work on the same period. As Elliot Sperling wrote in his 1995 review: > ...since the 1949 publication of Giuseppe Tucci‚Äôs Tibetan Painted scrolls > [and in] the absence of any single monograph dedicated to the public, this > last work was often taken by default as the main secondary source on the > subject....[While] ‚ÄúCentral Tibet and the Mongols‚Äù is a relatively short > work and leaves a few subjects less than fully explored... [it] is now the > basic secondary source to which students of Yuan-Tibetan relations must > turn. (Journal of the American Oriental Society 115.2 (1995): 342‚Äì3) Petech has several students, including Elena De Rossi Filibeck in Tibetan studies.

Early life Ron Larson was born in Fort Lewis near Tacoma, Washington, the second of four children of Meredith John Larson and Harriet Eleanor Larson. Meredith Larson was an officer in the 321st Engineer Battalion of the United States Army. Meredith Larson served in active duty during World War II, where he was awarded a Bronze Star Medal and a Purple Heart, and the Korean War, where he was awarded an Oak Leaf Cluster and a Silver Star.U.S. Army Awards of the Silver Star for Conspicuous Gallantry in Action During the Korean War During the years that Ron was growing up, his father was stationed in several military bases, including Chitose, Hokkaido, Japan and Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. While in Chitose, Ron attended a small DoDDS school, where he was one of only three students in the sixth grade. When Meredith Larson retired from the Army in 1957, he moved with his family to Vancouver, Washington, where he lived until he died (at the age of 89) in 2005.(February 9, 2005). \\"Obituaries: Mederith Larson\\". The Reflector, Battle Ground, Washington Harriet Larson died (at the age of 95) in the fall of 2009. Larson spent his first two years of high school at Leilehua High School in Wahiawa, Hawaii. In 1957, when his family moved to Vancouver, Washington, Larson enrolled in Battle Ground High School, where he graduated in 1959. On October 29, 1960, at the age of 18, he married Deanna Sue Gilbert, also of Vancouver, Washington. Deanna Gilbert was the second child of Herbert and Dorothy Gilbert. Ron and Deanna Larson have two children, Timothy Roland Larson Timothy R. Larson and Jill Deanna Larson Im, five living grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. Their first grandchild, Timothy Roland Larson II, died at birth on summer solstice, June 21, 1983. Larson is the third generation of Norwegian and Swedish immigrants who left Scandinavia to homestead in Minnesota in the late 1800s.Norwegian Immigration, Minnesota State University The surnames and immigration dates of his great-grandparents are Bangen (1866, Norway), Berg (1867, Norway), Larson (1868, Norway), and Watterburg (1879, Sweden). Education From 1959 until 1962, Ron and Deanna Larson started and operated a small business, called Larson's Custom Quilting. In 1962, they sold the business and Ron began attending Clark College in Vancouver, Washington. In 1964, he obtained his associate degree from Clark. Upon graduation from Clark College, Larson was awarded a scholarship from the Alcoa Foundation, which he used to attend Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon. He graduated, with honors, from Lewis & Clark in 1966. During the four years from 1962 through 1966, Ron worked full-time, first at a restaurant and then at a grocery store, in Vancouver and Deanna worked full-time as the secretary to the president of Roberts Motor Company in Portland, Oregon.Ron Larson Professor From 1966 to 1970, Larson attended graduate school at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He received his master's degree in 1968 and his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1970. While at the University of Colorado, Larson was the recipient of an NDEA scholarship and an NSF fellowship. He also served as a teaching assistant. His Ph.D. dissertation \\"On the Lattice of Topologies\\" was written under Wolfgang J. Thron.Jones, William B., Ellen E. Reed, and Fred W. Stevenson (Volume 33, Number 2, 2003, 395-403. \\"Biography of Wolfgang J. Thron\\". Rocky Mountain Journal of Mathematics. Larson's Ph.D. lineage, as listed by the North Dakota State University, traces back through George David Birkhoff, Joseph Louis Lagrange, Leonhard Euler, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, the co-developer of calculus.Mathematics Genealogy Project Academic career Larson and Hostetler signing first contract, 1976 In 1970, Larson accepted a position of assistant professor at Penn State Erie, The Behrend College in Erie, Pennsylvania. At the time, Behrend College was a 2-year branch campus of the university. In 1971, the Board of Trustees of the University met with the Behrend Advisory Board to announce Behrend College would become the first location outside University Park with the authority to develop baccalaureate program and confer degrees locally. During his first several years at the college, Larson was instrumental in developing a mathematics major at the college. He served as a member of the University Faculty Senate and also as Behrend College's representative on the University Faculty Council. Larson was promoted to associate professor in 1976 and professor in 1983. Early in his career at Penn State, Larson started writing manuscripts for textbooks. He completed and submitted three manuscripts for calculus texts in 1973, 1974, and 1975 ... only to be rejected by several publishers. Larson relates his determination to continue writing in an essay titled A Single Dream.A Single Dream \\"When Marilyn Monroe was asked if she had been lucky in her career, she said 'When you have a single dream it is more than likely to come true---because you keep working toward it without getting mixed up.' Anyone who has been in my office knows that I am a Marilyn fan. But not just a Marilyn fan---I am a fan of the American Dream.\\" Finally, in 1976 he and his co-author, Robert P. Hostetler, obtained a contract from D. C. Heath and Company. The first edition of their calculus book was published in December, 1978. In 1995, Hostetler left the authorship team and was replaced by Bruce A. Edwards of the University of Florida. Calculus by Larson and Edwards is now in its eleventh edition. It is used worldwide and has been translated in several languages.Cengage Learning During the academic year of 1983-84, Larson served as the acting division head for the Division of Science at Penn State Erie. In 1998 Larson was given the Distinguished Alumnus Award from Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon.Lewis & Clark College Distinguished Alumnus Award Books Counting different editions, Larson has written over 400 titles.Library of CongressLibrary of Congress They are used by several million students each year in the United States, as well as by students in other countries. Larson's books have received many awards - for pedagogy, innovation, and design.Text and Academic Authors AssociationText and Academic Authors Association One of these awards was for developing the first completely interactive calculus textbook online. The work on this text was spearheaded by Larson's son, Timothy Larson. The online text, titled Interactive Calculus was posted in 1995. Another award was for innovation in page design. Beginning in 1990, Larson has written all of his mathematics texts to design, so that concepts and examples never break from page to page. The eighth edition of Calculus won the 2005 Benny Award for the best cover in all categories of printing.Benny Awards, 2005 (Calculus Houghton Mifflin) The middle school series, Big Ideas Math, won the TAA Textbook Excellence Award (\\"Texty\\") in 2010 for excellence in secondary mathematics textbook publishing.Texty Awards, 2010 Larson's textbooks have won awards from the Textbook Authors' Association (TAA) multiple times, including the McGuffey Longevity Award, the TAA Textbook Excellence Award, and the Most Promising New Textbook Excellence Award. Up until 1995, most of Larson's books were published by D. C. Heath, which was owned by Raytheon. In 1995, Raytheon sold D. C. Heath to Houghton Miffin. By 1999, Larson's titles had become a major component of Houghton Mifflin's publications. In that year, he was listed in the company's annual report as one of Houghton Mifflin's major authors. In 2008, the College Division of Houghton Mifflin was sold to Cengage Learning. Larson's textbooks have been translated into Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and French.Spanish Translation of CalculusChinese Translation of Calculus An Applied ApproachPortuguese Translation of Statistics Company founder In 1984, Larson formed a small company that he called Larson Texts, starting with four employees in an old cottage on the campus of Behrend College. The cottage had been part of the original estate of Ernst Behrend, founder of Hamermill Paper Company.(July 10, 2008) \\"Penn State Behrend Unveils Archives at Open House\\". Penn State Behrend Archives. This company grew through a sequence of larger offices. In 1992, Larson gave up his sole proprietorship of the company to form a corporation called Larson Texts, Inc.Pennsylvania Corporations In the same year the company purchased Typographics, a small typesetting firm in Erie, Pennsylvania. Typographics came with a group of employees who were experienced in design, graphic arts, and composition. In 2000, the company bought and renovated the former Belle Valley School into a office building.Larson Texts, Inc It has over 70 employees, who work in design, composition, and research ... all connected with the development and production of Larson's textbooks. In 2000, it was listed in the Top Ten Best Places to Work in Pennsylvania for medium-sized companies.Best Places to Work in PA In 2008, the company formed a publishing division called Big Ideas Learning which publishes textbooks at the middle and high school levels. These textbooks follow the new curriculum and practices specified by the Common Core State Standards Initiative. In addition to specifying a common curriculum in mathematics, the Common Core State Standards Initiative specifies eight Mathematical Practices that students should be taught. In keeping with this curriculum and practices, Larson has written a book titled Mathematical Practices, with examples of how teachers can implement the curriculum and practices in Grades K-8.MathematicalPractices.com Beginning in 2008, Larson Texts began a policy of having the content of its copyrights available free on the Internet. Currently, this policy applies to all of its 7 middle school titles, its 3 high school titles, and its title Math & You.

I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment to talk with the math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, you have to remember that I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no idea--and so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964.\\" Acceptance Speech at Lewis & Clark College Awards #Roland E.

This festival celebrates the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and in the Mangalorean Catholic community involves blessing of Novem (new crops). In certain Goan Catholic dialects the festival's name is corrupted to \\"Moti Fest\\". According to the Konkani scholar, Fr. Pratap Naik, S.J., the festival derives its name from the Capela de Nossa Senhora do Monte (Portuguese for 'Chapel of Our Lady of the Mount') in Old Goa. The chapel was constructed in AD 1519 on a hillock commanding a view of the Mandovi River on the orders of Afonso de Albuquerque in honour of Our Lady. Its feast on 8 September, called Monti Saibinichem Fest (Konkani for 'Lady of the Mount Feast'), had been started in the sixteenth century and continues to this day. Since, flowers and garlands are an integral part of the celebration, the Konkani epithet Fulanchem Fest (Feast of flowers). Father Naik had the following observations: According to the Hindu calendar after Shravan month, Bhadrapad month commences. On the fourth day of this month comes Ganesh Chaturthi. For this feast all members of the Goan Hindu family gather and celebrate from one-and-half to ten days. During this festive period Ganpati's image is installed in the house and flowers are offered to it daily. On one day during this festive period new corn is ceremoniously partaken. The Christianisation of Goa led to the mass conversion of Hindus from Ilhas de Goa (Tiswadi) and Jesuits taught the new converts to offer flowers to honour of Monti Sabin (Lady of the Mount) just as they offered flowers to Ganpati before their conversion. Thus, the Nativity feast which is celebrated all over the Catholic world on 8 September came to be called Monti Saibinichem Fest (Lady of the Mount Feast) in Goa. The Konkani-speaking converts of those days followed the Hindu traditions associated with Ganpati festival and celebrated the new corn fest with vegetable menu on 8 September. Thus was born today's Monti Fest. It is significant that Fr. Joachim Miranda, who initiated Monti Fest at Monte Mariano Church, Farangipet, Canara in AD 1763, was of Goan Catholic origin and would have been familiar with the festal celebration in Goa. Thus, Goa is said to be the original host of Monti Fest. Though Tippu Sultan destroyed the churches of Canara, he spared the Monte Mariano Church at Farangipet in deference to the friendship of his father Hyder Ali with Father Miranda.

This should not be confused with colourisation, in which color is artificially added to source material that was always black-and-white (or where no colour information was preserved in the black-and-white copy), or used to enhance poor-quality original sources. Colour recovery is a newer process and is fundamentally different from colourisation. Colour recovery relies on particular effects that are created when colour source material is encoded into common analog television formats and then played back. In early colour televisions, until the mid-1980s, this could lead to a problem known as dot crawl because the encoding of colour information could interfere with the underlying signal. This causes a form of distortion in the output signal displayed on the screen. This pattern is evident even if the resulting image is recorded on film, even in black-and-white film. Colour recovery looks for these tell-tale patterns and uses them to decode the original colours. , colour recovery has successfully been applied to episodes of the BBC TV programmes Doctor Who, Dad's Army, Are You Being Served? and The Morecambe & Wise Show. Background Due to the well-documented practice of wiping, many original videotape recordings of colour programmes were lost. However, in the case of the BBC, many telerecorded black and white film copies of affected programmes survived. For a variety of technical and practical reasons (for example various incompatible international TV standards, and the then-high cost of videotape over that of film), black and white film copies were the preferred medium for selling programmes overseas. This practice ultimately led to many programmes which were originally made and transmitted in colour only existing in black and white form after the practice of wiping finally ceased. Methods of colour recoveryFrom off-air recordings= During the 1970s, various off-air NTSC video-recordings were made by American and Canadian Doctor Who fans, which were later returned to the BBC. Whilst the quality of these early domestic video recordings was not suitable for broadcast, the lower-definition chrominance signal could be retrieved from them. This signal could be successfully combined with the luminance signal from digitally- scanned existing broadcast-quality monochrome telerecordings to make new colour master copies, suitable for broadcast and sales. In the 1990s this method was carried out by the Doctor Who Restoration Team. Several colour Doctor Who serials were subsequently released on VHS. Combining the video- recorded colour signals with the monochrome telerecordings is a non-trivial task, requiring digital processing (for example matching up the different screen sizes of the two recordings). Thus, it wasn't until the early 1990s that cheaply available, sufficiently powerful computer hardware and software made this task particularly practical at that time. =From chroma crawl= Black & white TV systems predate colour, and so subsequent analogue colour broadcast systems have been designed with backwards-compatibility in mind (known as a compatible colour system). Thus, the chrominance (colour) signal is typically 'shoe-horned' into the same channel as the luminance (brightness) signal, modulated on a fixed frequency, known as the colour subcarrier. Black and white televisions do not decode this extra colour information in the subcarrier, using only the luminance to provide a monochrome picture. However, due to limited bandwidth in the video channel, the chrominance and luminance signals bleed into each other considerably, resulting in the colour information showing up visibly as Chroma Crawl, or Chroma dots on black & white TV sets. This is normally considered a nuisance in analogue broadcasting. However, since telerecordings were made from black & white TV screens and technicians at the time often decided not to apply a filter to remove this interference, these patterns are retained even in the existing monochrome film prints and theoretically contain the original colour information. (Occasionally the colour information was filtered out using a notch filter and is lost.) The idea to recover this information was originally suggested by BBC researcher James Insell. In practice however, the recovery of this colour information from telerecordings is highly complex for several reasons. Firstly, the colour reference timing signal, known as the colour burst, is absent from telerecordings, as it is nominally off the edge of the visible screen area being recorded. This timing has to effectively be recovered since the phase of the chroma dots, which is represented by their horizontal position on the screen, determines the hue of the reconstructed colours. Distortions in the geometry of the telerecordings due to the nature of physically recording from a non-flat CRT screen onto film means that a transformation has to be applied in order to infer the original positions of the chroma dots within the broadcast. However, these technical obstacles were finally overcome in 2008, and software written by developer Richard Russell at the informal Colour Recovery Working Group was put to use, finally resulting in the broadcast and release of colour-recovered episodes of Dad's Army and Doctor Who, and subsequently two episodes of The Morecambe & Wise Show as well as the \\"Party Political Broadcast (Choreographed)\\" sketch from Monty Python's Flying Circus Example of the chroma dot reconstruction: File:Mouse pad Remicade Infliximab.jpgOriginal picture File:mousepad_in.jpgBlack and white picture with chroma dots File:Mousepad quad.gifQuadrant calculation for Colour reconstruction File:mousepad_out.jpgReconstructed Colour picture (reconstructed using software written by Richard Russell) See also *Room at the Bottom#Colour restoration of the original television recording *Reverse Standards Conversion * Multi-Colourisation, DVD special feature on Doctor Who: Dalek War DVD Box set ReferencesExternal links * A visual comparison showing the resulting differences between traditional colourisation and Colour recovery * Pictures of a Marconi quick-pull-down 16mm Film Recorder of the kind used to record Dad's Army and Are You Being Served Category:Film and video technology ","title":"Colour recovery"},{"id":"22846603","text":"Father Millet Cross and North Redoubt, 1967 The Father Millet Cross is a memorial on the grounds of Fort Niagara in Youngstown, New York.

During the preceding winter, disease and starvation overwhelmed the fort's garrison of a hundred men and only twelve of them were saved by a rescue party.

There is many ways of playing canpan√≤ according to the tradition of the locality, the bell tower's design and the number of bells that are used. The tradition was to play at midday, but today the bell player usually works in a factory, so plays at evening. In general, there are not any limits about the number of bells which may be played. Playing \\"a cop\\" Usually ist called \\"a cop\\", which is the canpan√≤ played with an only bell. In this case the player uses the left-hand to play with the clapper, and with the right-hand, they knock onto the external surface with a stone. In the region where it was played a cop the tradition is played for the 7 or 14 days before the date of the patron saint of the church. This kind of ringing is used only in the bell tower that had no more than a bell. Playing \\"a canpan√≤\\" or \\"a batarela\\" Playing Canpan√≤ or batarela is a method using three or four bells. In this case, the player ties the bells, so they cannot move. Then the player connects by a rope each clapper to a fixed support, putting it in traction sufficiently to holding the clapper at 1‚Äì2 cm near the bells internal surfaces. Now, pulling with the hands on the ropes, they can play the belts. Usually, they use their right-hand to play the small and the big bells, and their left-hand to playing the medium ones. If the bells are placed on more levels, they will play one of these with a foot or they call another player to help them. This kind of canpan√≤ is used in the region where is played a cop. Usually, people ring for seven days before the day of the patron saint. Playing \\"a canpanon\\" The canpanon is the equivalent of the batarela for the churches of the north of the province of Belluno. A lot of players play four or five bells, and everyone does not play more than one or two. Usually, the bells are very big and require the large part of the bell tower's space, so the players must stay in dangerous places. The bells are not tied and are played feeding the clappers by the hands. The canpanon is played the day before the patron saint's day, Christmas and Easter. Other similar playing methods Near the Lake Garda the style of playing canpan√≤ is similar to the batarela style, but the ropes tied at the clappers are not parallel, and the action that the player make on these to playing is not vertical but axial. In the Po valley, a large number of bells are played by an equal number of players according to a prefixed sequence. The bells are fed directly by ropes from the base of the bell tower. Sequence The sequences of passages are different in each church. In a lot of areas, the tradition will that the players play a fix composition written on a paper or teach through the generations. This operation is necessary when there are more players. In other places (usually, where is ring a batarela or a cop) there are many symphonies that the player juxtaposes according their pleasure. In this case, the compositions may be copied from a place to another, but they appear ever different because the characteristics of the bell tower changes.

It is the first entry in the Mah≈ç Daisakusen trilogy, which includes Kingdom Grand Prix and Dimahoo, and the first video game to be created by Raizing. Sorcer Striker served as the debut title of Raizing, a development company founded by former Compile staff who previously worked on the Aleste series. Though first released in arcades, the game was later ported to other platforms, each one featuring various changes compared to the original version and has since been re-released for PlayStation 4 as part of the M2 ShotTriggers label by M2. The title has been met with positive reception from players and critics since its initial release.  Gameplay  Arcade version screenshot. Sorcer Striker is a science fantasy-themed vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game reminiscent of Seirei Senshi Spriggan, where players assume the role of one of the four playable characters through six increasingly difficult stages across Violent Kingdom in an effort to overthrow the Goblin empire led by King Gobligan and reclaim the bounty placed over his head by King Codwenna as the main overall objective. The gameplay borrows elements from previous Compile shooters, as players control their ship over a scrolling background until a boss is reached. Each ship is equipped with two weapons; the main gun is powered-up by obtaining coins from \\"P\\" bags, while the subweapon can be swapped or power-up by acquiring one of the three magic books by destroying incoming carriers, ranging from homing shots to spread shots and a straight shot, however the use of each subweapon alternates between characters. Players are also equipped with bombs capable of obliterating any enemy within its blast radius. Similar to MUSHA, players will occasionally fight against a miniboss on certain stages of the game. The title uses a respawn system where players immediately starts at the location they died at. Getting hit by enemy fire or colliding against solid stage obstacles will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the ship's firepower to his original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. After completing the first loop, the game starts back to the first stage after completing the last stage at the second loop. Defeating the second loop results in achieving the true ending.  Synopsis  Plot = The plot summary of Sorcer Striker is explained through supplementary materials. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). A goblin movement successfully established an empire of their own, prompting King Codwenna of Violent Kingdom in gathering his knights to launch a disastrous attack against the Goblins. King Codwenna learned that the Goblins were ruled by a human leader and the mass production of mana-based magical weapons, which shocked Codwenna as nobody succeeded in reproducing them and their operation were limited and not fully understood. Foreshadowing the doom of his kingdom and the failure of his knight order, Codwenna placed a bounty on the head of King Gobligan, waiting for the arrival of a hero to save them. = Characters = Players choose from four characters at the start: * Gain ‚Äì Pilot of the Valhallyzer ship. A wandering warrior who, alongside his monkey companion Shain, seeks the ultimate weapon to become the strongest. * Chitta ‚Äì Pilot of the Gun Dalf ship. A young magic user who receives training from his grandfather. * Miyamoto ‚Äì A samurai dragon whose master was killed by his apprentice Tsumujimaru. * Bonum ‚Äì A necromancer whose body becomes one with his dragon helm gear.  Development  Early conceptual artwork. Sorcer Striker was originally envisioned to be a shoot 'em up game with a Chinese martial arts thematic, before being ultimately reworked into a fantasy-themed shooter project instead. Sorcer Striker was first project to be developed by Raizing (now Eighting), a Japanese video game developer founded by former Compile staff who previously worked on the Aleste series. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). (Translation by Shmuplations. ). Its development was helmed by a crew of approximately four members with designer Kazuyuki Nakashima, Seirei Senshi Spriggan programmer Yuichi Toyama, artist Kenichi Yokoo and then-27 years old freelance composer Atsuhiro Motoyama, with the team recounting its creation process and history through various Japanese publications. Toyama wanted to develop an arcade project, as the team were discussing what to make when Raizing was first founded. Due to his president's connection with Toaplan as a former employee, Toyama decided to work on an arcade game with Toaplan providing consultance and advising to the team, as well as licensing their arcade board for launch. Sorcer Striker entered development in March 1992 with the staff working on the bedroom of an apartment using development tools from Toaplan, initially envisionsed as a Chinese martial arts-themed shoot 'em up under the working title Haougekiden Saifuaa, however Tatsuya Uemura and other members of Toaplan advised the team that shooter games need a worldwide appeal and the project was ultimately revised into a fantasy-themed shoot 'em up approachable for any skill level to attract RPG players on consoles. The power-up system was modelled after MUSHA, as Yokoo was a fan of the game. To portray the player's shots and explosions more flashier, the team introduced mecha elements into their design and aimed for a steampunk-esque aesthetic. Ship designs were given hand-like extremities as the team wanted to give them character, however Yokoo stated said designs also served as an experiment to determine if they could merge the ship's operability and personality together to avoid gameplay interference with their hitbox, while the samurai dragon Miyamoto was used as a test to determine reaction towards a humanoid \\"ship\\" from players. The team also wanted to emphasize a sense of story, making the playable characters speak at the beginning and end of stages. Gain, whose name derived from the character Gainshain in Shunji Enomoto's Golden Lucky manga, was designed with a tough and muscular look as the team thought of preferences from arcade players at the time, with Yokoo stating that adding his monkey companion gave him more character. Chitta, whose name derived from the \\"Cinechitta\\" movie theatre at Kawasaki near Raizing's then-offices at Kamada, was intended to be a \\"moe\\" magical girl and the team made her perform stuff such as idol concerts, however Yokoo stated that \\"it seemed it really didn't have the effect we were hoping for.\\" Bonum was named after bones and his name is a reference to the character Bornnam from the first part of Hirohiko Araki's JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Other characters were inspired by Wizardry. Dedicing on the game's final name prior to launch proved difficult for the team, as Sorcer Striker was first titled Mahou Daisensou in Japan, however the release of Irem's In the Hunt prompted a long brainstorming session that resulted with Mahou Daisakusen being chosen out of more than a hundred suggestions. Nakashima claimed that due to their development environment at the time, the team was ultimately able to produce a \\"very strong, colorful game.\\"  Release  Sorcer Striker was first released in arcades by Able Corporation across Japan and Europe in May 1993, using a Toaplan-licensed arcade board. In 1994, a CD music album containing was first published exclusively in Japan by Shinseisha. An officially endorsed manga adaptation by Raizing was also published by Shinseisha on the same year. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). The game was first ported to the X68000 and published by Electronic Arts Victor on 16 December 1994, featuring a number of options such as MIDI support. The title was then ported to the FM Towns and published by Electronic Arts Victor in February 1995, with Redbook audio based on the X68000 version but featuring a lower frame rate and missing special effects. In 2005, it was later ported to mobile phone platforms such as EZweb by Eighting. = M2 ShotTriggers = On 2 November 2017, M2 released a new version of Sorcer Striker as part of their M2 ShotTriggers publishing label for PlayStation 4. This version includes a number of exclusive additions such as an easier difficulty setting and the ability to play with two aircraft simultaneously in single-player.  Reception  According to Yuichi Toyama, Sorcer Striker did not perform poorly. In Japan, Game Machine listed it on their 1 August 1993 issue as being the seventh most-successful table arcade unit of the year. The Sharp X68000 version was met with positive reception. GameSetWatchs Todd Ciolek noted that the game \\"didn't quite stand out as much as the Aleste series had.\\" Hardcore Gaming 101s Kurt Kalata regaded it to be \\"an excellent game, though one that tends to be forgotten in favor of Raizing's more innovative and ambitious titles.\\" Famitsu gave the PlayStation 4 version an overall 25 out of 40 score.  Legacy  Sorcer Striker was the first entry in the Mah≈ç Daisakusen trilogy. A sequel, Kingdom Grand Prix, was first released for arcades in 1994 before being published on Sega Saturn in 1996 by GAGA Communications. A third entry, Dimahoo, was only released for arcades by Capcom in 2000. Gain, Chitta, Miyamoto and Bonum would re-appear as guest characters in both Battle Garegga and Armed Police Batrider.

Both sides of this canal are called Kegeyli because they were surrounded by kegay trees and turquoise. This was later generalized to the town.  History  Kegeyli district was created in 2004 by the merger of former Bozatau district (the northern part of today's district) and former Kegeyli district (the south-eastern part of today's district). This merger was effected by Resolution 598-II of the Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan (11 February 2004) and Resolution 225 of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan (11 May 2004), which abolished Bozatau district and created the enlarged Kegeyli district.  Locations  As of 2011 there were eleven locations holding an official status: one city (Xalqobod), two towns (Kegeyli, Qozoonketkan) and nine communities (Abat, Aktuba, Aspantay, Erkindarya, Janabozor, Jalpaqjap, Kumshunko ªl, Oqto ªba, Qiziluy).

He did his elementary studies at the school of the famed Abbey of Port Royal in Paris, then studied at the Coll√®ge d'Harcourt, following which he entered the Oratory of Paris, and did theological studies at the Seminary of Saint Magloire attached to it.Archives de l‚ÄôAncien R√©gime \\"S√©minaires parisiens\\" In 1691 he completed his studies and was ordained to the priesthood. In 1693 he was made commendatory abbot of Saint-Quentin-en-l'Isle and preacher to King Louis; he was also appointed to succeed to Seat 20 in the French Academy.Acad√©mie francaise \\"Jean-Paul Bignon\\" He was charged by the minister Colbert to head the Bignon Commission, which investigated the feasibility and then began the compilation of a guide to French artistic and industrial processes, published in the following century as the Descriptions of the Arts and Trades. Bignon worked with his uncle to prepare a new set of rules for the Academy, allowing for honorary membership, which were signed by the king in January 1699. The new rules, however, were rejected by its members. The rejection shocked him to such a degree that he refused to attend its meetings thereafter. Bignon was a patron of Antoine Galland, the first European translator of One Thousand and One Nights. He was also the author of Les aventures d'Abdalla, fils d'Hanif (The adventures of Abdalla, son of Hanif), published in 1712‚Äì1714, a novel framed as the title character's search for the fountain of youth and composed of \\"stories of adventure and love\\" in which \\"great stress is laid upon the 'horrid,' the grotesque, the fantastic.\\" His fame as a preacher is exemplified by two completely different panegyrics he gave on the same day, for the feast day of St. Louis IX. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1734. Publications Bignon also contributed to the M√©dailles du r√®gne de Louis le Grand, Sacre de Louis XV. From 1706 to 1714, he presided over the committee of men of letters who edited the Journal des s√ßavans, which position he took again in 1724, with the Abb√© Pierre Desfontaines.

It is based on the novel of the same name by Kevin Sampson that was published in 1998. The film follows Paul Carty, a 19-year-old in the aftermath of his mother's death who becomes part of The Pack - a legendary group of football hooligans who dress casual and wear Peter Storm cagoules, carry Stanley knives and follow Tranmere Rovers F.C. Plot The film begins in 1979 with Paul Carty (Nicky Bell), with his sister Molly, (Holliday Grainger) and father, at his mother's graveside. After his sister escorts her dad away from the grave, Carty, looking at his watch, starts to run off. Along his way he gets changed into casual clothing and carries on running until he catches a football special train. Aboard the train, he meets the leader of the football firm, John Godden (Stephen Graham), an ex-soldier who warns him he has no room for runners in his firm and he best stand his ground. When walking through the train, he meets Elvis (Liam Boyle), and Carty reminisces about how they met in a series of flashbacks. We learnt that Carty has always been fascinated by The Pack, observing them at Tranmere games when they fight and trying to dress like them, at which point Baby Millan (Oliver Lee), taunts Carty and threatens him but Elvis leads the other lads away and Carty stands his ground. Carty eventually meets Elvis at a club night and the pair realise they have many things in common from music taste to wanting out of Birkenhead. The pair fantasise about leaving for Berlin. Carty, over their next few meetings, begs Elvis to introduce him to The Pack but Elvis calls them a \\"gang of pricks\\" and says Carty does not want to be involved. Eventually, after Carty headbutts a rude sales assistant in a record shop to prove his fighting skills, Elvis gives in and tells him to meet him on the train at 12:00 on Saturday. It fast-forwards onto the train again, and The Pack are led by Godden to meet a rival firm. Once there, the two groups scrap and Carty is taken over by a thrill as he is embroiled in the fight. Carty returns home and we discover that his sister knows about his fascination with The Pack. The next day, Carty promises to take her shopping for her birthday in Chester. However, after an argument with Elvis when Elvis tells him he is making a \\"twat out of himself\\", Carty leaves work to find Elvis there. The pair go for a drink and forget about their argument, and Carty forgets completely about his sister. He promises he will take her out another time the day after, as his mind is firmly on the meet The Pack has when they travel to Wrexham that day. Once there, police attempt to form a barrier between the firms but Carty breaks through and cuts a Wrexham fan with his Stanley - much to the delight of Godden, who finally accepts him as one of The Pack. Everyone toasts Carty on the train home, except Baby Millan and Elvis who are far from happy about his new status. That night at The Pelican, the HQ and chosen pub of The Pack, Carty is \\"initiated\\" with a girl who he takes outside to have sex with. Once out there, Godden warns Baby Millan to not deal heroin to the members of the firm, warning The Pack cannot have any \\"smackheads\\". Baby replies \\"But it's okay for Elvis to do it?\\", much to the puzzlement of Godden and the rest of the firm. Outside, Carty does not perform well with the girl, and the lads all rib him for this. Carty and Elvis one night meet two women, Sonia (Rebecca Atkinson) and Jackie on a bus and take them back to Elvis' bohemian-style flat, which has stars on the wall and a noose to remind him of the \\"certainty of death\\". Elvis' behaviour becomes erratic as he consumes heroin, and when Carty refuses, Elvis rejects Sonia's advances and plays the guitar instead. Carty, waking up, sees Sonia in the bathroom and the pair have sex. The next day, Elvis and Carty are on their way to another away day when the pair argue in front of Godden. Elvis, taunting Carty's choice of women, is obviously hurt when Carty taunts his performance in bed with the women in front of The Pack. Godden taunts Elvis for taking heroin. Carty tries to apologise to Elvis as the pair walk in front of The Pack, and Carty spots the opposition firm coming towards them. He yells at the firm and urges The Pack to join them - and Godden does, only briefly, before headbutting Carty and telling him he is the leader of The Pack. Carty's reign as a top boy in the firm is over and Elvis is back to his jovial self on the train home as Carty sulks in the corner. Carty forgets about the Pack for a while and we see him telling his boss, Uncle Bob, that he will go back to college to do his Foundation Course. He spends more time with his sister and he urges her to go out one night. In a taxi, Carty meets a pretty girl, Natasha (Sacha Parkinson), whom he had previously met in a club. The pair are spending a romantic night in when Carty's sister enters, visibly shaken up. She has been roughed up by a gang of boys and Carty, attempting to sort them out, is beaten up by them too. He recruits the help of Elvis and The Pack (without Godden, who Elvis informs him, has been killed by Baby Millan after a disagreement in The Pelican). The Pack beat up the gang of lads who roughed up Carty's sister, and Carty finds Elvis crying on the waterfront. Carty thanks him and says he owes Elvis one, but Elvis replies Carty does not owe him anything, and tells Carty \\"He always loved you, Carty\\". At Godden's funeral, Carty is sitting in the church after everyone leaves when Elvis enters and asks Carty if he will hear his confession. Carty, confused, agrees. Elvis is seen through the confession booth inhaling what appears to be heroin, and he tells Carty to come away with him to Berlin. Carty, currently enjoying a healthy relationship with his family, tells him he cannot yet. Elvis is upset by this, and tells him \\"He always loved you Carty\\", meaning himself. Elvis asks Carty for one more away day, before leaving. At the final away day, Carty is stood on the station platform waiting for Elvis to meet him yet there is no sign of him. He catches the train just in time and as the train pulls away, Elvis is visible sat on top of a bridge overlooking the track, as the train crosses underneath it, the bridge is covered in smoke and once it clears, Elvis has gone, hinting at suicide. Carty is out of place in The Pack without Elvis and after a final meet with a local firm in which Carty does not get involved, he is cut with a knife by Baby Millan, who calls him a \\"ponce\\". Carty then turns away from The Pack and walks out of the street, saying \\"How long had I waited for this day? Out of here. Out of this.\\" Soundtrack The soundtrack of Awaydays (released by the Universal Music Group) is pivotal to the film and comprises post-punk and electronic music, appropriate for the film's setting and atmosphere, especially focused on the music of Ultravox and Joy Division ;Track listing # Ultravox - Young Savage (2:58) # Carty And Elvis in Eric's (0:21) # The Rascals - All That Jazz (2:57) # Cabaret Voltaire - Nag Nag Nag (4:38) # \\"Sunrise\\" (0:49) # \\"Liverpool 1979\\" (1:11) # Magazine - The Light Pours Out of Me (4:35) # \\"When We Go To Berlin\\" (0:58) # Ultravox - Slow Motion (3:27) # \\"Wool Stomp\\" (1:17) # The Cure - 10:15 Saturday Night (Home Demo) (4:35) # Joy Division - Insight (4:23) # \\"Come And See The Stars\\" (0:39) # \\"Elvis's Dub\\" (2:36) # \\"Carty Deflated\\" (1:48) # \\"Carty's Revenge\\" (1:07) # Echo & the Bunnymen - Going Up (4:01) # Carty's Last Awayday (1:27) # Ultravox - Just For a Moment (3:12) # The Mekons - Where Were You?

In 1743, on his brother's death he was made royal librarian (a post Armand-J√©r√¥me had inherited in turn from their uncle Jean-Paul Bignon). Armand-J√©r√¥me resigned from it in 1770 in favour of his son J√©r√¥me-Fr√©d√©ric. He was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1743 and to the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions in 1751. He was made conseiller d‚Äô√âtat in 1762 and pr√©v√¥t des marchands de Paris in 1764. The scholar Dupuy pronounced his elogy. It was his negligence in the latter post that caused the accidents in the firework display for the marriage of the Dauphin (later Louis XVI) and Marie-Antoinette in May 1770 that left over 300 dead and a greater number of wounded. Even so, he appeared in his box at the Op√©ra only three days after the disaster, causing all Paris to become indignant. Under Louis XIII, the pr√©v√¥t des marchands de Paris and the two premiers √©chevins were fined for not having repaired a bridge whose collapse killed 4 or 5 people. Under Louis XV, his faults born of a lack of foresight were never punished. Paris thus avenged itself by bon mots against him, including the Latin anagram of his name as Ibi non rem, damna gero (I don't do good, I do evil).

In some of the poorest parts of Nigeria, Pentecostal evangelical religious fervour is combined with the old but persistent African belief in sorcery and black magic. Thousands of children are victimised, abused, abandoned or even killed as they are blamed for having brought about disease, misfortune, death and famine by their alleged witchcraft.

When Timidria, an anti-slavery group, attempted to organize a ceremony to liberate 7,000 slaves in Inat√®s in early 2005, the CNDHLF said that the group should instead characterize the ceremony as a \\"campaign for public awareness and popularisation of the law criminalising slave practices\\".

The new rule, published on November 26, 2008, went into effect on January 26, 2009. CBP is taking a phased-in approach in terms of implementation and enforcement. During the first 12 months, importers will be warned of infractions instead of being fined, with the hope that the importers will establish a filing system. All ISF filings are required to be submitted electronically via the Automated Broker Interface (ABI) or the Automated Manifest System (AMS). For shipments on the water on or after June 30, 2016, CBP had ended the phased-in approach and ISF compliance is in full effect. If compliance is not met, liquidated damages penalties up to $5,000 may be issued by the local port for each violation.

St Richard's was rated 'outstanding' by Ofsted in 2006, a rating that it sustained following an interim assessment in 2010. Of the school community, HM Inspectorate commented 'The social, moral, spiritual and cultural development of students is outstanding'.https://files.api.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/978201 St Richard's also scored a Level 1 (the highest rating) in each section of its 2018 Denominational Inspection Report.https://www.strichardscc.com/wp- content/uploads/2019/01/Diocesan-S48-Inspection-Report-1.pdf History St Richard's Catholic College was opened in 1959. Its construction was funded, in part, by fundraising within the local Roman Catholic community. For example, in July 1958, just under ¬£1000 was raised by Catholics in Eastbourne for the Diocesan education fund. When it was first opened, the college was known as St Richard's Catholic School; it was named after St Richard of Chichester (1197 - 1253), who visited Bexhill during his lifetime. It is probable that St Richard built the manor house at Manor Barn, found in the ancient centre of Bexhill- on-Sea, the ruins of which are still visible today. The raison d'√™tre of St Richard's Catholic School was to offer a denominational secondary education for the local Catholic population. Hitherto, there had been a number of Catholic primary schools in the area (e.g. St Mary Star of the Sea in Hastings and St Joseph's in Eastbourne, inter alia), though there had previously been no sufficient provision for Catholic children over the age of eleven. As a result, St Joseph's in Eastbourne was severely overcrowded. The school was obliged to take infants, juniors and seniors, despite that 'the buildings [were] totally inadequate to house all these groups for education'. St Joseph's has since closed and been replaced by St Thomas a Becket Catholic Primary School. St Richard's was, and remains, the only Catholic secondary school in East Sussex (the nearest alternatives being in Brighton and Tunbridge Wells). As such, it has always had a substantial catchment area, traditionally ranging from Eastbourne, through Bexhill, to the vicinity of the Hastings area. At the time of the school's construction, the issue of transporting children into Bexhill proved controversial within Eastbourne's town council. Indeed, a series of contemporary newspaper articles from the Eastbourne Gazette and Eastbourne Herald reveal the contention that surrounded the payment of the future pupils' train fares. It was suggested in February 1958 that, when the school was built, Eastbourne's council should subsidise half the cost of Eastbourniyn pupils travelling into Bexhill. In March, however, the council's Education Committee voted by a majority of eight to six to cover the whole cost of pupils' fares. This decision followed a letter from the archdiocesan secretary responsible for education (at his time, Eastbourne and Bexhill both fell within an archdiocese - the Archdiocese of Southwark - as Arundel and Brighton had yet to be created). Yet, this was not the end of the episode. On 1 April, Eastbourne council's Finance Committee urged the main chamber to reconsider their U-turn. Concerned over the cost to rate payers, the Finance Committee argued that the council should only pay for half of pupils' fares. Travel for a single child, at that time, would have cost 2s6d a week. Finally, on 8 April, the council agreed with the Finance Committee and voted by a majority of twenty to five to subsidise only half of any future pupils' fares. Another vote, which passed by fourteen to eleven, allowed for families in 'hardship' to claim for a 100 p/c subsidy on rail fares. This proved controversial at the time, as some interpreted the vote to contradict contemporary directives issued by the Ministry of Education (whereby full fares, in that instance, could be paid). Moreover, it was feared that many local Catholics simply would not be able to afford the cost - and that many would be too proud to go 'cap in hand' to the council and plead 'hardship'. Some believed the decision was reached because of the denominational nature of the new school. Indeed, the council did pay for the entire fares of other pupils travelling similar distances. So, prior to the elections of May, the same year, local Cannon J J Curtin took the issue to the pulpit at Sunday Mass: \\"It would be a good if all Catholics,\\" he said, \\"when canvassed for their votes [...] satisfied themselves that candidates would, if elected, endeavour to get the decision of Eastbourne Council to pay only half of the fare for pupils to the new Catholic school in Bexhill rescinded.\\" Further action was taken by the local church in October. Archdiocesan representatives wrote to the relevant Ministry, expressing concern over the legality of the council's decision. However, after a legal review by the town clerk, the decision to pay for half fares was kept. The council held out on the issue. alt=In its early years, St Richard's Catholic School existed largely in the shadow of the local grammar (now Bexhill High Academy). This was because St Richard's offered placements based on faith rather than on intelligence. It is for this reason that St Richard's continues to have a higher than average proportion of pupils for whom English is a second language. However, following the Cessation of Grant Regulations 1975, which saw the conversion of many grammar schools across the country, the playing field between St Richard's and Bexhill High (as it was known) was to levelled. The school's reputation has increased since the late 1980s, largely as a result of the accession of Mr Anthony Campbell OBE to the position of Headmaster. After a series of reforms under Campbell, St Richard's became the forerunning state school in East Sussex. It still frequently comes first in the county league tables for both results and Progress 8. Campbell's achievements were recognised in the 2007 New Year's Honours List, wherein he received an OBE for 'services to education'. Campbell retired in 2008; his retirement mass and celebrations were recorded in the local paper. The role of headmaster has since been taken over by Miss Doreen Cronin, under whom the school has continued to flourish and attain excellent results. Under her tenure, GCSE results (the highest qualification offered at the school, save for an AS in Religious Studies) have remained well above average. In 2018, the first year that the new grade 1 - 9 GCSEs were sat, 83 p/c of pupils achieved a grade 4 or above in English and Maths. This is well above the National and the County averages (National 68 p/c). Coat of Arms The arms of St Richard's Catholic College are depicted on an escutcheon divided into three sections by an ordinary - a pall. The pall denotes that the arms are derived from St Richard himself, who was a bishop. Palls, or palliums, are part of the vestments worn by senior clergy in the Roman Catholic Church. Originally, they were peculiar to the Pope, but for many centuries they have been bestowed by him on metropolitans and primates as a symbol of the jurisdiction delegated to them by the Holy See. There are three charges on the arms of St Richard's Catholic College, found in the three divisions of the field left by the pall (said divisions being dexter chief, sinister chief and nombril point). At the dexter chief point of the escutcheon (or top right from the viewpoint of the bearer, dexter being from the Latin 'dextra' meaning 'right') is a wavy six pointed star, or 'estoile'. At the sinister chief point of the escutcheon (or top left from the viewpoint of the bearer, sinister being from the Latin 'sinister' meaning 'left') are six martlets. This is typical charge among the noble families of Sussex. Indeed, the county's arms also include these six martlets. Ostensibly, the birds represent the six historical rapes (sub-divisions) of Sussex. The birds' presence in the both the St Richard's and county arms likely bears a canting connection to the Earls of Arundel: the French word for swallow is hirondelle. The Earls of Arundel were the leading family in the county for many centuries; the 20th Earl, Saint Philip Howard, lends his name to one of the school's four houses. At the nombril point of the escutcheon (or bottom centre, nombril being from the French nombril meaning \\"belly button\\") is the image of Saint Richard of Chichester himself. He is depicted in his ecclesiastical robes and mitre, with his crosier in one hand and administering a blessing with the other. This image is taken from a thirteenth century wall painting of St Richard, painted shortly after his canonisation. The motto St Richard's Catholic College is Comitas, Scientia, Cartias, meaning \\"Community, Knowledge and Charity\\". The motto reflects the Catholic values of the school, as well as its dedication to learning.  Societies  St Richard's Catholic College has a number of student and staff run societies, including a Latin, French, Classics, and debating club, among many others. The debating union has held two major in-school debates. The inaugural debate of the St Richard's Union was attended by hundreds of pupils and judged by Huw Merriman MP and Amber Rudd MP, then Home Secretary. The Union was established, and is maintained, entirely by the pupils themselves. The school also has a range of councils, run by prefects and teachers (e.g. Liturgy council, Eco council, School council, etc). The school council is run by the Head Boy and Head Girl, who are chosen from among the year tens (the penultimate year group) at the end of each school year. The selection progress is rigorous, including several interviews and two elections (with one election enfranchising the candidates' peers, and another exclusive to the school's teachers). Head Boys and Head Girls of St Richard's take an active and prominent role in school life, giving speeches and supporting peers.  Spiritual life  243x243px St Richard's works closely with the local Church to ensure that pupils are grounded in the Catholic faith. The college has a Spiritual Life Team who are responsible for promoting and co-ordinating liturgical activities throughout the year. They also lead the community in supporting the spiritual journeys of all who come to learn and work at St Richard‚Äôs. This Team is led by the Lay Chaplain and is assisted by Liturgy Captains, who are chosen from among the student body. Local priests are regularly in college and are available to staff, pupils and parents. They lead assemblies and school Masses on special occasions and Days of Holy Obligation. Year group Masses and form Masses are celebrated by the priests of both Deaneries on a rota basis. Pupils at St Richards are provided the opportunity to receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation. The prayer of St Richard (attributed to the Saint himself) is often recited at college. It goes as such: \\"Thanks be to thee, my Lord Jesus Christ, for all the benefits Thou hast given to me, and for all the pains and insults Thou hast bourn for me. Most merciful redeemer, friend and brother, may I know Thee more clearly, love Thee more dearly, and follow Thee more nearly. Amen.\\" The prayer has been adapted to music and forms the school hymn, which is sung rousingly on special occasions. As a Roman Catholic School, charity and alms-giving are central to school life. Thousands of pounds are typically raised each year for various charities, particularly CAFOD, the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development. Fund raising activities are the prerogative of both students and staff. Indeed, during lunchtimes, student-led bake-sales are a common sight in the school corridors; charity talent shows, fashion shows, and Mufti days are also common fixtures in the school calendar.  House System  There are four houses at St Richard's Catholic College: Rigby, Wells, Gwynne and Howard (red, yellow, green and blue, respectively). Each house is named after an English martyr from around the time of the reformation. Apart from Saint Philip Howard, each of the martyrs for which the houses are named were canonised by Pope Paul VI in 1970. The former three are each one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. The houses are not a central part of life at St Richard's, though they do determine the colour of PE kit that is worn by pupils. Nonetheless, they do become important on Sports Day, held in the summer term, where pupils compete ferociously for the title of champion. The winning house on Sports Day is determined by the number of points allocated to it after all events are finished. A single point is awarded to each pupil for participation; greater numbers of points are allocated to pupils who achieve a place on the podium. Members of each house usually sing chants to each other (for example 'Gwynne Gwynne for the win', or 'Red Army' for Rigby House). Each house also elects a captain for the day, apart from Wells whose captain is known as the 'Prince of Wells' . The Prince of Wells typically leads a call and response chant whereby he/she cries, 'Tunbridge' and the rest of the house replies, in unison, 'Wells!'. Sports Days take place on the school playing field, which St Richard's also allows local primary schools to use for similar events. = Rigby = Saint John Rigby was (ca.1570 - 21 June 1600) from, Eccleston, near Chorley, Lancashire. He was the fifth or sixth son of Nicholas Rigby, by his wife Mary (n√©e Breres). In 1600 Rigby was working for Sir Edmund Huddleston. Sir Edmund, sent him to the sessions house of the Old Bailey to plead illness for the absence of his daughter, the widow Mrs. Fortescue, who had been summoned on a charge of recusancy. A commissioner then questioned Rigby about his own religious beliefs. Rigby acknowledged that he was Catholic and was thus sent to Newgate. The next day, the feast day of St Valentine, he signed a confession saying that since he had been reconciled to the Roman Catholic faith by Saint John Jones, a Franciscan priest, he had not attended Anglican services. Over the course of his imprisonment, Rigby was twice was given the chance to recant, but he twice refused. As such, Rigby was sentenced to death hanging, drawing and quartering. He gave his executioner a piece of gold, saying, \\"Take this in token that I freely forgive thee and others that have been accessory to my death.\\" Rigby was executed at St Thomas Waterings. Cut down too soon, he landed on his feet, but was thrown down and held while he was disemboweled. According to Challoner, \\"The people, going away, complained very much of the barbarity of the execution.\\" = Wells = Saint Swithun Wells was born at Brambridge House, Hampshire in 1536, of a wealthy country family, and was christened with the name of the local saint and bishop Swithun. He was the youngest of the five or six sons of Thomas Wells of Brambridge, by Mary, daughter of John Mompesson. During the Reformation, his family contributed to the secret funerals of Catholics at the local cemetery, and their house was a place of refuge for priests. Wells was well-educated, a poet, musician, and sportsman. Among his travels, he had been to Rome, and had a working knowledge of Italian. In June 1586, he was arrested with seminarians Alexander Rawlins and Christopher Dryland and imprisoned in Newgate, but was released 4 July when his nephew posted bail. On 9 August 1586, he was examined for supposed complicity in the Babington Plot, and on 30 November 1586, he was discharged from the Fleet prison. At one point he went to Rome on a mission for the Earl of Southampton, but he returned to England to work in the English Catholic underground. He was again examined 5 March 1587, and on this occasion speaks of the well known recusant, George Cotton of Warblington, Hampshire, as his cousin. In 1591, Edmund Gennings was saying Mass at Wells's house, when the priest-hunter Richard Topcliffe burst in with his officers. The congregation, not wishing the Mass to be interrupted, held the door and beat back the officers until the service was finished, after which they all surrendered peacefully. Wells was not present at the time, but his wife was; she and Gennings were arrested along with another priest by the name of Polydore Plasden, and three laymen named John Mason, Sidney Hodgson, and Brian Lacey. Wells was immediately arrested and imprisoned on his return. He was charged under the 1585 Act Against Jesuits, Seminary Priests and Other Such Disobedient Subjects. At his trial, he said that he had not been present at the Mass, but wished he had been. Wells was sentenced to die by hanging, and a gibbet was erected outside his own house on 10 December 1591. On his way to the scaffold, Swithun caught sight of an old friend in the crowd and said to him \\"Goodbye my dear. Goodbye to our nice hunting companies. Now I have something much more important to do.\\" Wells was buried in St. Andrew's Churchyard in Holborn. = Gwynne = Saint Richard Gwyn (ca. 1537 ‚Äì 15 October 1584), also known by his anglicised name, Richard White, was a Welsh school teacher. He was martyred by being hanged, drawn and quartered for high treason in 1584. His feast day is celebrated on 17 October. Gwyn was a Catholic during the reign of Elizabeth I, under whom it was illegal to adhere to any faith but Protestantism. Gwyn often had to change his home and his school to avoid fines and imprisonment. Finally in 1579 he was arrested by the Vicar of Wrexham, a former Catholic who had conformed to Anglicanism. He escaped and remained a fugitive for a year and a half. He was recaptured, and spent the next four years in one prison after another. In May 1581 Gwyn was taken to church in Wrexham, carried around the font on the shoulders of six men and laid in heavy shackles in front of the pulpit. However, he \\"so stirred his legs that with the noise of his irons the preacher's voice could not be heard.\\" He was placed in the stocks for this incident, and was taunted by a local Anglican priest who claimed that the keys of the Church were given no less to him than to St. Peter. \\"There is this difference\\", Gwyn replied, \\"namely, that whereas Peter received the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven, the keys you received were obviously those of the beer cellar.\\" Gwyn was fined ¬£280 for refusing to attend Anglican church services, and another ¬£140 for \\"brawling\\" when they took him there. When asked what payment he could make toward these huge sums, he answered, \\"Six-pence\\". Gwyn and two other Catholic prisoners, John Hughes and Robert Morris, were ordered into court in the spring of 1582 where, instead of being tried for an offence, they were given a sermon by an Anglican minister. However, they started to heckle him (one in Welsh, one in Latin and one in English) to the extent that the exercise had to be abandoned. Richard Gwyn, John Hughes and Robert Morris were indicted for high treason in 1583 and were brought to trial before a panel headed by the Chief Justice of Chester, Sir George Bromley. Witnesses gave evidence that they retained their allegiance to the Catholic Church, including that Gwyn composed \\"certain rhymes of his own making against married priests and ministers\\" and \\"[T]hat he had heard him complain of this world; and secondly, that it would not last long, thirdly, that he hoped to see a better world [this was construed as plotting a revolution]; and, fourthly, that he confessed the Pope's supremacy.\\" The three were also accused of trying to make converts. Despite their defences and objections to the dubious practices of the court Gwyn and Hughes were found guilty. At the sentencing Hughes was reprieved and Gwyn condemned to death by hanging, drawing and quartering. This sentence was carried out in the Beast Market in Wrexham on 15 October 1584. Just before Gwyn was hanged he turned to the crowd and said, \\"I have been a jesting fellow, and if I have offended any that way, or by my songs, I beseech them for God's sake to forgive me.\\" The hangman pulled on his leg irons hoping to put him out of his pain. When he appeared dead they cut him down, but he revived and remained conscious through the disembowelling, until his head was severed. His last words, in Welsh, were reportedly \\"Iesu, trugarha wrthyf\\" (\\"Jesus, have mercy on me\\"). = Howard = Saint Philip Howard, 20th Earl of Arundel (28 June 1557 ‚Äì 19 October 1595) was an English nobleman. He was born during the upheaval of the Reformation. His home from the age of seven was a former Carthusian monastery. At the age of fourteen he was married to his stepsister, Anne Dacre. He graduated from St John's College, Cambridge in 1574 and was about eighteen when he attended Queen Elizabeth I's Court. His life had been a frivolous one, both at Cambridge and at Court where he was a favourite of the Queen. Philip Howard's father, the Duke of Norfolk, was arrested on 1 October 1569 for his intrigues against Queen Elizabeth. The Duke was attainted and executed in 1572, but Philip Howard succeeded to his mother's inheritance upon the death of his grandfather, becoming Earl of Arundel in 1580. He was present at a debate held in 1581 in the Tower of London, between Father Edmund Campion, a Jesuit, Father Ralph Sherwin and a group of Protestant theologians. He was so impressed by the Catholics that he experienced a spiritual conversion. He renounced his previous, frivolous life and was reconciled with his wife. Arundel, with much of his family, remained Catholic recusants during the reign of Queen Elizabeth. He was himself suspected of disloyalty, and was regarded by the discontented Roman Catholics as the centre of the plots against the queen‚Äôs government, and even as a possible successor. Howard was committed to the Tower of London on 25 April 1585. He was charged before the Star Chamber with being a Roman Catholic, with quitting England without leave, sharing in Jesuit plots, and claiming the dukedom of Norfolk. He was sentenced to pay ¬£10,000 and to be imprisoned during the queen's pleasure. In July 1586 his liberty was offered to him if he would carry the sword of state before the queen to church. In 1588 he was accused of praying, together with other Romanists, for the success of the Spanish Armada. He was tried for high treason on 14 April 1589, found guilty and condemned to death, but his sentence was not executed; Queen Elizabeth never signed the death warrant, but Howard was not told this. He was kept constantly in fear of execution, although comforted by the companionship of a dog, which served as a go-between by which Howard and other prisoners, most notably the priest Robert Southwell, could send messages to each other. Although these two men never met, Howard's dog helped them to deepen their friendship and exchange encouragement in each other's plight. One day Howard scratched into a wall of his cell these words: Quanto plus afflictiones pro Christo in hoc saeculo, tanto plus gloriae cum Christo in futuro (\\"the more affliction [we endure] for Christ in this world, the more glory [we shall obtain] with Christ in the next\\") Howard spent ten years in the Tower, until his death from dysentery. He petitioned the Queen as he lay dying to allow him to see his wife and his son, who had been born after his imprisonment. He was refused. He remained in the Tower, never seeing his wife or daughter again, and died alone on Sunday 19 October 1595. He was immediately acclaimed as a Catholic Martyr. School Awards St Richard's have been awarded, by the government, a Leading Edge Status.http://www.schooljobsearch.co.uk/upload_files/docs/33_school_information_pack1423583137.pdf This means that they have been recognised as an example to others in how they teach. Also St Richard's is a Fairtrade School.  Performance  In 2018, St Richards was ranked as second in the county for Progress 8 attainment; its rating stands as 'well above average'.

The Band consists of Tria Ramadhani (vocal), Muhammad Iqbal/Qibil and Arlanda Langitan (guitar), Dipa Hasibuan (bass) and Erick Nindyoastomo (drums). They have released five albums, namely Mencoba Sukses (2006), The Changcuters & Misteri Kalajengking Hitam, (2009), Tugas Akhir (2011), Visualis (2013), and Binauralis (2016). Mencoba Sukses Kembali, a repackaged variant of Mencoba Sukses which was released in 2008, led to the group receiving the 2009 AMI Award for Best Newcomers. They have also played in The Tarix Jabrix trilogy. Their musical style is The Hives-and-The Rolling Stones-influenced. The band announced that their upcoming sixth album titled Loyalis will be released in 2020. Name The name of The Changcuters is rumored to be derivation of the word \\"kancut\\" (Indonesian for male's underwear), as pronounced with a Sundanese accent. However, the band insists that it was a pun of the name of a friend, namely Cahya. Ricky Siahaan from Rolling Stone Indonesia said, \\"Even from their name you can tell that they‚Äôre a comical band.\\" Career The Changcuters was formed in 2005 by Dipa, Tria and Qibil. Later on the band would be joined by Erick and Alda, members of Qibil's former high school band. In August 2006, assisted by Uki of Peterpan, they released their debut album, Mencoba Sukses. However, due to limited distribution and promotion, the album did not sell well. They would then sign a contract with Sony BMG (now Sony Music) and the album was re-released in 2008 with the name Mencoba Sukses Kembali. The new album included two additional songs, namely \\"Racun Dunia\\" and \\"I Love You Bibeh\\". The musical style on the album is a mix of rock and roll and pop. Several tracks from this album were included on the soundtrack of The Tarix Jabrix (2008), a film in which they acted. As of 2009, the album has sold more than 75,000 copies. This album won the band Best Newcomers at the 2009 AMI Awards. Before releasing their second album, they released a single \\"Sang Penakluk Api\\", which was included on the soundtrack of Si Jago Merah (2008). They launched their third album, The Changcuters & Misteri Kalajengking Hitam, in mid-2009. In \\"Main Serong\\", some of the lyrics deal with the lifestyles of urban youths, such as in \\"Bebek Beringas\\" and \\"Mr. Portal\\", which describes a person's favorite motorcycle and a conflict with a security guard, respectively. \\"SDSB (Seputar Dago Seperti Biasa)\\" describes a night in Dago, Bandung. \\"Main Serong\\" is about infidelity. \\"Gembel Cinta\\" advises the listeners to not hold on to their broken hearts for too long. \\"Remaja Masa Kini\\" describes youth delinquency. The same year, they played in The Tarix Jabrix 2, a sequel to The Tarix Jabrix. The last film in which they played, The Tarix Jabrix 3, was released in mid-June 2011. In mid-2011, Tugas Akhir was released. It drew influence from country, surf rock, and rockabilly. Marcel Thee from Jakarta Globe described the album as \\"nothing but a waste of soundwaves\\". He gave \\"Tari Getar\\" as an example of a parody which satirizes the big band genre, sounding like a poor version of the classic \\"Batman Theme\\". He wrote that the single \\"Only Love\\" tried to show breezy nuance, but failed because of Tria‚Äôs breathy vocals, which deprived the limp melody of much-needed power. \\"Filosofi Rock N Roll\\" apes the dirtier edge of rock, with inspiration taken from Little Richard, complete with distorted vocals draped in heavy reverb. On \\"Surfing Di Arab\\" the band mixed surf rock and Arabian music, with the result described by Thee as \\"sounding like the confused lovechild of Dick Dale and Aladdin\\". Ricky Siahaan of Rolling Stone Indonesia wrote that the album had some funny lyrics, such as in \\"Bu Lisa\\", about a student who fell in love with his teacher, and \\"Mama Papa Pujaan\\", a compliment to the parents. He described \\"Cuaca Ekstrim\\", which is about someone who caught a cold, as having a \\"serious\\" tone but \\"catchy\\" melody. Its CD cover design resembles a student's final task cover, and illustrates the theme of the album. One single from this album, \\"Parampampam\\", was released in January 2011. The lyrics are bilingual and invites the listeners to learn English. Styles They describe their musical styles as a mix of rock, funk, punk revival, indie pop, jazz and blues. Kris Putranto from Nu:B Magazine said that their musical styles is similar to The Strokes, noting that the intro of \\"Racun Dunia\\" is exactly the same as The Strokes' \\"Last Nite\\". Chris True from Allmusic wrote that the band is also influenced by The Beatles, The Doors, Aerosmith, The Stone Roses, and Oasis. Mariani Dewi from The Jakarta Post said their fashion style gave them a distinct style. They usually wear very tight pants and have old-fashioned hairstyles. Putranto said that their appearances mixed that of The Hives and The Rolling Stones.

Davies was born at Y Wern, near Tomen y Castell, Llanfechain, Montgomeryshire. He was educated at the village school and was to become a cooper, but with the help of the poet Owain Myfyr went to All Souls College, Oxford, graduating in 1795. He took Holy Orders and became a Church of England curate in the parish of Meifod, Montgomeryshire, moving in 1799 to Ysbyty Ifan, Denbighshire where he met and married his wife Mary. He went on to study at Trinity College, Cambridge, gaining his MA in 1803. He was awarded the living of Llanwyddelan and became rector of Manafon in Montgomeryshire where he remained for 30 years and did most of his literary work. In 1797 he had begun a survey of the agriculture and economy of North Wales, which was published in two volumes in 1810 and 1813. This was followed in 1815 by a report on South Wales in collaboration with Iolo Morganwg (Edward Williams). He contributed to Samuel Lewis's Topographical Dictionary of Wales (1833). In 1837, he moved to the parish of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, where he died in 1849 and lies buried in the parish churchyard. Davies was closely associated with the London Welsh, especially the Gwyneddigion Society, and the revival of the Cymmrodorion Society in 1820. He was a keen supporter of eisteddfodau, where he won many prizes, and he played an important role in establishing provincial eisteddfodic societies.

In this form, the theorem asserts that if, as y ‚Üì 0, the non-negative sequence an is such that there is an asymptotic equivalence :\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty a_n e^{-ny} \\\\sim \\\\frac{1}{y} then there is also an asymptotic equivalence :\\\\sum_{k=0}^n a_k \\\\sim n as n -> ‚àû. The integral formulation of the theorem relates in an analogous manner the asymptotics of the cumulative distribution function of a function with the asymptotics of its Laplace transform. The theorem was proved in 1914 by G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood. In 1930, Jovan Karamata gave a new and much simpler proof. Statement of the theoremSeries formulation= This formulation is from Titchmarsh. Suppose an ‚â• 0 for all n, and as x ‚Üë1 we have :\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty a_n x^n \\\\sim \\\\frac{1}{1-x}. Then as n goes to ‚àû we have :\\\\sum_{k=0}^n a_k \\\\sim n. The theorem is sometimes quoted in equivalent forms, where instead of requiring an ‚â• 0, we require an = O(1), or we require an ‚â• ‚àíK for some constant K. The theorem is sometimes quoted in another equivalent formulation (through the change of variable x = 1/ey ). If, as y ‚Üì 0, :\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty a_n e^{-ny} \\\\sim \\\\frac{1}{y} then :\\\\sum_{k=0}^n a_k \\\\sim n. =Integral formulation= The following more general formulation is from Feller. Consider a real-valued function F : [0,‚àû) ‚Üí R of bounded variation.Bounded variation is only required locally: on every bounded subinterval of [0,‚àû). However, then more complicated additional assumptions on the convergence of the Laplace‚ÄìStieltjes transform are required. See The Laplace‚ÄìStieltjes transform of F is defined by the Stieltjes integral :\\\\omega(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}\\\\,dF(t). The theorem relates the asymptotics of œâ with those of F in the following way. If œÅ is a non-negative real number, then the following statements are equivalent *\\\\omega(s)\\\\sim C s^{-\\\\rho},\\\\quad\\\\rm{as\\\\ }s\\\\to 0 *F(t)\\\\sim \\\\frac{C}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\rho+1)}t^\\\\rho, \\\\quad\\\\rm{as\\\\ }t\\\\to\\\\infty. Here Œì denotes the Gamma function. One obtains the theorem for series as a special case by taking œÅ = 1 and F(t) to be a piecewise constant function with value \\\\textstyle{\\\\sum_{k=0}^n a_k} between t=n and t=n+1. A slight improvement is possible. According to the definition of a slowly varying function, L(x) is slow varying at infinity iff :\\\\frac{L(tx)}{L(x)}\\\\to 1,\\\\quad x\\\\to\\\\infty for every positive t. Let L be a function slowly varying at infinity and œÅ a non-negative real number. Then the following statements are equivalent *\\\\omega(s)\\\\sim s^{-\\\\rho}L(s^{-1}),\\\\quad\\\\rm{as\\\\ }s\\\\to 0 *F(t)\\\\sim \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\rho+1)}t^\\\\rho L(t), \\\\quad\\\\rm{as\\\\ }t\\\\to\\\\infty. Karamata's proof found a short proof of the theorem by considering the functions g such that :\\\\lim_{x\\\\rightarrow 1} (1-x)\\\\sum a_nx^ng(x^n) = \\\\int_0^1g(t)dt An easy calculation shows that all monomials g(x)=xk have this property, and therefore so do all polynomials g. This can be extended to a function g with simple (step) discontinuities by approximating it by polynomials from above and below (using the Weierstrass approximation theorem and a little extra fudging) and using the fact that the coefficients an are positive. In particular the function given by g(t)=1/t if 1/e‚àí1/N the sum Œ£anxng(xn) is a0+...+aN, and the integral of g is 1, from which the Hardy‚ÄìLittlewood theorem follows immediately. ExamplesNon-positive coefficients= The theorem can fail without the condition that the coefficients are non-negative. For example, the function :\\\\frac{1}{(1+x)^2(1-x)}=1-x+2x^2-2x^3+3x^4-3x^5+\\\\cdots is asymptotic to 1/4(1‚Äìx) as x tends to 1, but the partial sums of its coefficients are 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4... and are not asymptotic to any linear function. =Littlewood's extension of Tauber's theorem= In 1911 Littlewood proved an extension of Tauber's converse of Abel's theorem. Littlewood showed the following: If an = O(1/n), and as x ‚Üë 1 we have :\\\\sum a_n x^n \\\\to s, then : \\\\sum a_n = s. This came historically before the Hardy‚ÄìLittlewood tauberian theorem, but can be proved as a simple application of it. =Prime number theorem= In 1915 Hardy and Littlewood developed a proof of the prime number theorem based on their tauberian theorem; they proved :\\\\sum_{n=2}^\\\\infty \\\\Lambda(n) e^{-ny} \\\\sim \\\\frac{1}{y}, where Œõ is the von Mangoldt function, and then conclude : \\\\sum_{n \\\\le x} \\\\Lambda(n) \\\\sim x, an equivalent form of the prime number theorem. Littlewood developed a simpler proof, still based on this tauberian theorem, in 1971.

It runs for along the length of Southend Pier, providing public passenger transport from the shore to the pier head. Operation The line is owned and operated by Southend-on-Sea Borough Council, and operates every day the pier is open. The normal service uses a single train, and runs every half- hour. At peak times a two train service is operated, providing a 15-minute interval service. Trains operate between stations known as Shore and Pier Head with no intermediate stops. Although once electrified, train service is currently provided by two diesel trains, running on narrow gauge track. Each train consists of a diesel-hydraulic locomotive at the southern end, five trailer coaches and, at the northern end, a driver control unit with passenger space. One train is named Sir John Betjeman, and the other Sir William Heygate. A twin-track island platform is provided at each terminus, and there is a passing loop in mid-pier, but otherwise the line is single tracked. The pier head terminus is in the open air, but the shore terminus is enclosed, and also provides rail access to a workshop for maintaining the trains. The Southend Pier Museum is situated below the shore station. History Sir William Heygate approaching the shore terminus in 2006. The pedestrian access to the pier can be seen descending from the station roof. Compare with the 1975 image (below), which shows longtitudinal sleepers, a central third rail for electrification, and no planking between the rails. The modern track has standard sleepers laid on top of the wooden planking; the location of the former second track is not planked. The current Southend Pier was preceded by a wooden pier built in 1830. In 1851, a narrow gauge horse tramway was introduced to convey goods and visitors to the pier head. Construction of the current pier commenced in 1887, and the plans included provision for an electric railway. Construction of the line commenced in 1888, with electrification being carried out by Colonel R. E. B. Crompton. By 1890, of gauge single track had been laid, and a single toast rack style car was in use. By the following year, the line ran the then full pier length of and trailer cars were in use. The system expanded, until eventually, by 1930, four trains, each made up of seven cars, were running on a line that was double track throughout. In 1949, the rolling stock was replaced with new trains similar in design to London Underground stock, built by AC Cars of Thames Ditton in Surrey. The new stock comprised four trains, again of seven cars, and was liveried in green and cream. Each train could carry up to 260 passengers. At a top speed of 18 mph, the journey took four minutes each way, and during peak periods a train ran every five minutes, continuing until 11pm. The record for passengers carried in one day stands at 55,000.South East Echo (retrieved 23 2010) In 1950, two redundant 1899-built trailer cars were acquired by Volk's Electric Railway in Brighton, where they were converted into motor cars numbered 8 and 9. These cars continued to operate in Brighton until the late 1990s, when they were again retired. Car 8 was returned to Southend to join the Southend Pier Museum collection, and car 9 is on display at the South Downs Heritage Centre at Hassocks. signalbox, crossovers and train in 1972 In 1978, the electric railway closed, due to deterioration and the cost of repairs.

As originally delivered, the trains were liveried in all-over burgundy with a white waist-band, but were repainted to a two-tone blue in 2006, retaining the white waist-band. They also carry a \\"Southend Borough Council\\" logo. A battery powered single passenger car, built by Castleline of Nottingham, entered service in November 1995 for service in winter. This car is numbered 1835, the year that Southend Pier first appeared on Admiralty charts. There are also several wagons for maintenance trains. On 9 October 2005, a fire severely damaged much of the pier head including the railway station. The station was temporarily re-sited, until a new and modern structure was opened on the original site in September 2009. Although the passenger trains were not damaged, two wagons used on maintenance trains were destroyed in the fire. In September 2016, the railway was out of action due to emergency engineering works, though the pier itself was still open to the public.http://www.southend.gov.uk/info/200306/southend_pier_and_cliff_lift/79/opening_times_ticket_prices_and_pier_train_information The Pier Railway reopened in late 2016.http://www.southend.gov.uk/info/200306/southend_pier_and_cliff_lift/79/opening_times_ticket_prices_and_pier_train_information Two new Severn Lamb built trains are scheduled to replace the 1986 built trains in 2021.Severn Lamb's Southend-on-Sea Success Severn Lamb 8 January 2020Countdown begins for Southend Pier fleet as renewal gets green light The Railway Magazine issue 1429 April 2020 page 72 Gallery File:0030 1949 train along pier2.JPGOne of the 1949 trains mid-pier, heading shorewards in October 1975.

He became the Commissioner of the Scout Association Malaya Branch which comprised the British Crown Colonies. (Within British Scout leadership hierarchy, Sands position was equivalent to a County Commissioner. All the Malay States and Straits Settlements were Districts only.) Sands spent the next 40 years helping to create Scouting in the region, and is often called the \\"Father of Malayan Scouting\\". It is only after his retirement that the posts of Chief Commissioners for Malaya and Singapore were created by the Boy Scouts Association in London for E.M.F. Payne and Canon R.K.S.

It is a contributing property to the Mill Street- North Clover Street Historic District. It was first built as a simple building by 1857 and gradually expanded and renovated into its current form over the next 30 years. The Italian Center was formed in 1928 and bought the house the same year, expanding it in the 1960s with a discreet rear wing. On April 19, 1972 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building The two-story building is near the eastern boundary of the historic district, a half-block west of the intersection of Mill and Columbus Drive, at the western fringe of downtown Poughkeepsie where the ground begins a gradual slope down to the Hudson River. It is faced in brick in running bond with stone rustication at the corners and windows. Projecting gable and a tower in front reach a third storey. The roof is slate, with sharp finials atop the gables and tower; the gables have been further decorated with bargeboards. A chimney and dormer pierce both slopes of the roof. There is no real cornice, just a row of wooden brackets under the eaves. A row of bricks on the third storey at the south (front) facade has been arranged in a corrugated pattern. Fenestration includes a first-floor triple window with curved transom top in stained glass. It is echoed by a double window with curved top on the second storey. A veranda wraps around the south gable to the double-doored main entrance on the east. It is supported by seven turned columns with a spindle decoration at the roofline. The railing is in a grid pattern with a large square newel and acorn-shaped top where it reaches the front steps. A large, modern rear wing extends from the north. It was completed after the house was listed on the Register and is meant not to intrude, as it cannot be seen from the front. History The house is first shown on an 1857 map of the city as an L-shaped building, at a time when that neighborhood was the city's most desirable residential area. Thirty years later, another map shows an east wing, and by 1891 the porch and tower are shown. In 1928, five local organizations that served the city's Italian American community merged to become the Italian Center and moved into the house. In the 1960s they built a rear wing on the house to accommodate larger events. There have been no other significant alterations to the house since.

It may also be known as the Razza d'Ivrea, after the town of Ivrea, or as the Piemontese Alpina. The Biellese is one of the seventeen autochthonous Italian sheep breeds for which a genealogical herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep- breeders. History The origins of the Biellese breed are unknown. In the early part of the twentieth century it was considered by some to be a sub-type of the Bergamasca breed; others did not share this view. The much-reported derivation of it, with the Bergamasca and other Alpine breeds, from Sudanese sheep is a hypothesis published in 1886 in the Trait√© de zootechnie of Andr√© Sanson, and is based on craniometry; it has no foundation in science. The breed was numerous in the area of Biella; in 1942 numbers were estimated at 40,000. As with many other Italian breeds, numbers dropped sharply after the Second World War. However, interest in the breed revived in the 1960s; the breed was officially recognised in 1985 by the then Ministero dell'Agricoltura e delle Foreste, and a herdbook was established in 1986. By 1994 there were more than 50,000 head, of which 1900 were registered in the herdbook. At the end of 2013 the total number registered was 1016; there has been no recent census of unregistered stock. Use and management The Biellese was formerly considered a dual-purpose breed, yielding meat and wool; it is now kept now principally for meat production. Lambs are usually slaughtered at a weight of 12‚Äì15 kg, or rarely at 18‚Äì20 kg. Some wether mutton from castrated animals slaughtered at 12‚Äì18 months is sold in the markets of Milan and Ravenna; there is demand from some immigrant communities for large entire (uncastrated) lambs. The wool is of carpet quality; rams yield about 3.5 kg, ewes about 3 kg, per year. The Biellese is commonly used for hybridisation with other breeds such as the Frabosana, the Garessina, the Sambucana and the Savoiarda to improve meat yield and growth rate. As in the past, management of the Biellese is most often transhumant: the flocks are kept on alpine pasture from June to October, and over-winter in the valleys, where they are fed hay. About 75% of the population is managed in this way. Management of a further 20%, mostly in the area of origin, is nomadic; these are often kept in relatively large flocks of 800‚Äì1000 head. Only a small percentage are kept in the same place year-round.

As public law enforcement officers, fire inspectors are duty bound, by law, to enforce fire safety legislation in the name of the Chief Fire Officer and the Chair of the Fire Rescue Authority of the Fire & Rescue Authority they are employed by, for the protection of members of the general public. In turn the Chief Fire Officer discharges power of authority by order of a Secretary of State (In England and Wales) or their equivalent in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Fire inspectors, like any other major enforcing officers from other enforcing authorities, have the same powers of authority of that of a police constable except that they cannot arrest persons. They can not, except in the event of fire or emergency, make forceable entry, unless first obtaining a warrant. There are three distinct sets of legislation covering all four countries within the United Kingdom. They are: * The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 & Fire & Rescue Services Act 2004 (England & Wales) * The Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 and the Fire Safety (Scotland) Regulations 2006 (Scotland) * The Fire and Rescue Services (NI) Order 2006 (Northern Ireland) PowersBackground= Fire authorities' powers are derived from several pieces of legislation. Fire authorities are also 'approved inspectors' under the Health & Safety at Work etc Act 1974 as \\"Inspectors of Health and Safety\\". The primary pieces of legislation are: * Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 * Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/contents/made Fire authorities also receive official authority from the Licensing Act 2003 and the Fireworks Act 2003. =Enforcement= Inspectors have powers to enter premises for the purposes of undertaking routine fire safety inspections. They can also close (prohibit) or restrict the use of unsafe buildings, issue other legal notices which enforce compliance with current fire safety legislation. Failure to comply with a notice is an ordinarily a criminal offence. Most routine inspections result in minor failings being found and this is normally dealt with by a report which asks for the deficiencies to addressed within a certain timescale. More serious cases however may warrant that immediate action is taken to reduce the risk to building occupants. In some cases the buildings may be closed or the use of the building restricted because of a deemed risk to public and building occupant's safety. Inspectors also have powers investigate the commission of an offence, and where a person or organisation is suspected of committing an offence which has specifically put persons at imminent risk of injury or death those persons or organisations are usually prosecuted. All suspects are cautioned and invited to attend a \\"PACE Interview\\". A PACE interview is a taped interview, under the provisions of Code E issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, where suspects are placed under caution and asked questions pertinent to the investigation. Transcripts of the interview can then be used in court. Enforcing authorities Different organisations enforce fire safety legislation depending on the nature of the premises. They are defined as \\"Enforcing Authorities\\", and are: # A fire and rescue authority. They enforce all premises within their area, with the exception of any premises that fall within the scope of the following enforcing authorities. # The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) are the enforcing authority for the following premises: * premises licensed under section 1 of the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 (except for Crown premises) * a Royal Navy ship under repair, construction, or conversion by any person other than the master or crew of that ship. * a construction site or building under reconstruction as a whole (note; if the premises is partly occupied, the enforcing authority will default to another applicable enforcing authority). # The fire service maintained by the Secretary of Defence (the MOD Fire Service) for all armed forces premises except Royal Navy ships as mentioned above. # A local authority for sports stadia/stands # A fire inspector, for any premises which are owned or occupied by the Crown. Note: There is a distinct difference between an \\"inspector\\" and a \\"fire inspector\\". 1\\\\. \\"Inspector\\" is a person appointed by one of the first four authorities listed above, and are appointed to enable that authority (as an entity) to discharge its duties under the order. Therefore, any 'notice' issued by an inspector on a premises, is done so in the name of that authority. 2\\\\. Although in law a \\"fire inspector\\" is a person appointed directly by the secretary of state to enforce fire safety standards in Crown premises and is as such a person appointed as an 'enforcing authority' in their own right, the term fire inspector refers more widely to any inspector who enforces fire safety legislation. RoleBackground= Most fire safety inspectors are uniformed officers and are professional firefighters who have transferred from front line service into the Fire Safety Department of the Fire & Rescue Service in which they work. Most Inspectors are of Watch Commander / Watch Manager rank or above. Some Fire & Rescue Services employ inspectors who have not had firefighting experience, but instead have experience in Fire Safety related fields in employment outside of the Fire Service. For example, in the Western Australian fire authorities' Built Environment Branch (AKA Fire Safety Branch), none of their Fire Safety Officers have transferred from that agency's operational fire fighter ranks. They are career specialist operatives with extensive fire technology skills and qualifications. =Confusion over the role with fire investigators= Fire safety inspectors undertake criminal investigations. They do not however investigate how a fire may have started. Whilst the cause of a fire may be pivotal to any criminal proceedings taken by Inspectors the actual job of establishing the cause of the fire is often very technical and requires the expert knowledge of a fire investigator. A fire investigator however has no powers to enforce legislation, so their role is to provide evidence for Fire Inspectors to take forward.

The Lord High Treasurer was head of the Kammarkollegium and, from 1634, one of five Great Officers of the Realm. Origin A \\"Master of the Chamber\\" (kammarm√§stare) or chamberlain, with the responsibility to supervise issues concerning the economy of the state, is mentioned as early as the beginning of the 14th century. During Gustav Vasa's time as king (1523‚Äì1560), the title was called √∂verste r√§knem√§stare as well, and the office holder was head of the chamber (kammaren), which was the first central bureau of Sweden. Later in the 16th century, an √∂verste r√§knem√§stare is among the privy councillors. From 1602, the chief of the chamber was named Lord High Treasurer, riksskattm√§stare. The office during the 17th century The chamber was reorganized and renamed Kammarkollegium during the first decades of the 17th century. It was one of five branches of the government from 1634, and the head of the Kammarkollegium, the Lord High Treasurer, was fifth in rank among the five Great Officers of the Realm. That meant that the office holder was not only one of the most prominent members of the Swedish Privy Council, but also a member of the government ruling the country during the minority of a king or regnal queen. Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie - Lord High Treasurer 1652-1660 The first Lord High Treasurer of Sweden was Seved Ribbing (1602‚Äì1613). He was succeeded by Jesper Mattsson Krus, but when Krus left the office in 1622, no new treasurer was appointed until 1634, although Count Palatine John Casimir acted as a de facto Lord High Treasurer without holding that title. When king Charles X Gustav died in 1660, he wished, through his will, that Herman Fleming would be appointed Lord High Treasurer and as such a member of the quintet ruling Sweden until young king Charles XI would come of age. The nobility opposed this, and ensured that Fleming missed out on the appointment. Instead Gustaf Bonde became the new treasurer. After the death of Sten Bielke in 1684, king Charles abolished the title. The king, who had come to age in 1672, generally wanted to avoid appointing new holders of the high offices, once these became vacant. The riksskattm√§stare title has not been used since, in contrast to two other offices that Charles XI abolished, Lord High Chancellor of Sweden and Lord High Steward of Sweden, who were both revived for a relatively short period in the late 18th century. The assignments of the Lord High Treasurer was taken over by the President of the Kammarkollegium.

Application programmers can integrate i-net Clear Reports using the public API which spans over 200 classes. Starting with release 11.0 i-net Clear Reports also supports the .NET programming language and offers a public API for further integration in other products. History In Version 11.0 i-net Crystal-Clear was renamed to i-net Clear Reports. At this time it also gained .NET integration as a major feature. i-net Crystal-Clear was primarily designed to read Crystal Reports templates. It had to be capable of reading the RPT report format and producing a reasonable output. For exporting and saving reasons a new file format had to be created later on, enabling Crystal-Clear to save the API results back and make them editable by a designer. In 2002 the first version of i-net DesignerXML, the report designer, was written using Java Swing. The editing concept is slightly different from some other designers, using a band-oriented report template format, meaning that reports are designed based on rows of data. The development efforts has changed in more recent years to a full reporting platform approach, rather than the developer-only, framework-based one. True to its roots, i-net Crystal-Clear still has the ability to read and execute Crystal Reports report templates up until the latest versions of Crystal Reports. Unlike Crystal Reports, however, the i-net Crystal-Clear report file format has always been an open format. Until version 9.0 it was an XML format. Since version 9, the report file format is in a zip-based format similar to OpenDocument. Flexibility Being a Java application, i-net Clear Reports has the ability to run on a variety of platforms and environments. There is virtually no restriction concerning data sources that can be used, as long as there is a JDBC driver available for accessing the data. For non-JDBC data sources, there are how-to's to write simple mini-drivers. With the new .NET API it got even more flexible and allows integration into .NET based applications. i-net Clear Reports comes as a standalone server as well as a servlet which can be run on any Java EE application server such as Tomcat, Jetty, IIS, or Apache (via PHP). Features can be added using the public API, or by adding custom JavaBeans which can be added to reports. User defined functions (UDF) extend the formula features of the embedded formula calculation routines.

Schwarzenberg Monument. Schwarzenbergplatz is a square in Vienna, Austria. It is actually more like a small, open street than a square, and it runs between the K√§rntner Ring section of the Ringstra√üe and Lothringerstra√üe. Travelling south, the street, Schwarzenbergstra√üe, becomes Schwarzenbergplatz after passing K√§rntner Ring. Schwarzenbergplatz then continues briefly until it becomes Rennweg Stra√üe as it passes by the large enclosed parks of Belvedere-Garten and the Palais Schwarzenberg, and the Schwarzenberggarten to the west. A large equestrian statue of Austrian Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, who fought with distinction in the Napoleonic Wars, is on display.  History  Soviet War Memorial. Until the mid-19th century, most of the area of today's Schwarzenberg square was occupied by Vienna's city walls. After the demolition of the city walls in the years from 1858 to 1863, these areas were now available for construction and, similar to the Ringstra√üenpalais, magnificent buildings were constructed here in the second half of the 19th century. In 1861, Emperor Franz Joseph I ordered the construction of the Schwarzenberg Monument to commemorate the victorious commander of the 1813 Battle of Leipzig, Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg. The equestrian statue was created by Ernst H√§hnel and completed in October, 1867. Franz Joseph I witnessed the commemoration ceremony of the First Vienna Mountain Spring Pipeline, on 23 October 1873 in front of the Palais Schwarzenberg (in an area that was not yet considered part of Schwarzenberg Platz). In August 1945, immediately after the end of World War II, the Red Army revealed the War Memorial (now popularly called the Russian Monument) behind the Hochstrahlbrunnen fountain. Until 1955, a Soviet T-34 tank was placed there. During the occupation, the southern part of square was renamed Stalin Square on 12 April 1946, and this name was officially effective until 18 July 1956. The \\"Haus der Industrie\\" (House of Industry), then No. 4 Stalin Square, was the seat of the Allied Council of the four occupying powers until 1955. In 2003 and 2004, the Schwarzenberg Square was re-designed by Spanish architect Alfredo Arribas and equipped with sunken lighting elements representing different lighting effects. In the course of restructuring, the few green spaces that had existed until then were removed, a matter of much public criticism. There was particularly strong opposition to the replacement of the largely still-existing slim light poles from 1904 by lighting fixtures that were perceived by critics as clumsy and clunky. Under the Schwarzenberg Square courses the Wien River and the underground line U4, and it was also once the location for the \\"Zwingburg\\", a shelter for homeless people who retreated into the Viennese sewers.

Biography Goodsir was born in Portland, Victoria, Australia, one of eleven children born to David James Cook Goodsir, Commissioner of Customs at Melbourne, and Elizabeth Archer (n√©e Tomlins). Her early art training started with Arthur T. Woodward at the Bendigo School of Mines and Industries from 1898 to 1899, and in 1899 some of her work was raffled in Bendigo to partly finance her study in Paris. The years following World War I saw a virtual exodus of Australian artists on a sort of Grand Tour to Paris, all intent on being part of the explosion of the arts taking place there. Painters like Rupert Bunny, Stella Bowen and Max Meldrum were drawn there by the appeal of the Left Bank. Others like Margaret Preston and Grace Crowley were inspired to develop in new directions by post-war Parisian art. Goodsir attended the Acad√©mie Del√©cluse, the Acad√©mie Julian (under Jean-Paul Laurens) and then the Acad√©mie Colarossi. From about 1912 she shuttled between London and Paris, but finally settled in Paris in 1921 at 18 rue de l'Od√©on. During her time in Paris Goodsir painted portraits of cosmopolitan women including her partner, Rachel Dunne, nicknamed Cherry. The Parisienne, a portrait of Cherry was painted around 1924. Her work was acclaimed and exhibited at the New Salon, the Salon des Ind√©pendants, and the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris as well as at the Royal Academy and the Royal Institute in London. On a short visit to Australia in 1927 she exhibited at the Macquarie Galleries in Sydney and the Fine Arts Gallery in Melbourne. In 1938 four of her oils were shown at the sesquicentennial exhibition at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. She was a member of the Societe Nationale des Beaux-Arts. Goodsir died in Paris, France in 1939. Goodsir's work showed strong composition and technique, favouring oils over watercolours. Despite turning out a large number of still lifes and interiors, her fort√© was portraits, including Katharine Goodson, Leo Tolstoy, Ellen Terry, Banjo Paterson, Bertrand Russell, Dame Eadith Walker, Countess Pinci and Italian leader Benito Mussolini.

He was a vocal critic during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet and braved potential detention and death threats to condemn human rights abuses and other atrocities the regime undertook. The process for his potential beatification opened in 2012 and he is titled as a Servant of God. He has also been referred to as the \\"bishop of the poor\\" for his dedication to the poor and oppressed. Life Enrique Alvear Urrutia was born on 31 January 1916Some sources suggest he was born on 29 January. in Cauquenes in Chile as the eighth of eleven brothers to Clorindo Alvear Zurita and Teodorinda Urrutia P√©rez; his brother was Eduardo. He spent his education first in his hometown and then in the Luis Campino Humanities Institute before he pursued a law degree from 1934 in the Pontifica Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile. In one spiritual retreat of Monsignor Carlos Casanueva Opazo he discovered his call to the priesthood and he began his ecclesial studies. He received his ordination to the priesthood in the Santiago Cathedral on 20 September 1941 from Jos√© Mar√≠a Caro Rodr√≠guez and then started pastoral work in archdiocese. He first worked as a professor in addition to being a spiritual director for seminarians. Pope John XXIII appointed him in 1963 as a bishop assigned as one of the auxiliaries for the Talca diocese while making him the Titular Bishop of Columnata. He received his episcopal consecration a month after the appointment from Ra√∫l Silva Henr√≠quez; the co-consecrators were Manuel Larra√≠n Errazuriz and Eladio Vicu√±a Ar√°nquiz. In 1965 he was appointed as the Bishop of San Felipe; he held that position until he resigned in 1974. But since he was under the retirement age Pope Paul VI named him as one of the two auxiliaries for the Santiago archdiocese as well as the Titular Bishop of Sita. He served as a Council Father in the Second Vatican Council in the second to fourth sessions. He opposed human rights abuses during the Pinochet dictatorship and defended the regime's victims all the while braving potential detention and death threats. In the evening on 11 September 1973 - against the advice of his aides - he went to prisons to inquire about people who were rounded up in a wave of arrests as part of Pinochet's coup against the sitting President Salvador Allende. There was also one occasion where bombs were placed in his office in a failed attempt to intimidate him into silence. He later became involved with the Episcopal Conference of Latin America and the Caribbean. He died on 29 April 1982 and his remains were interred in the Marian shrine Nuestra Se√±ora de Lourdes in Quinta Normal until their transferral on 13 April 2008 to the San Luis Beltr√°n church. Pope Francis - during his trip to Chile in 2018 - made an unscheduled visit to the late bishop's tomb for some brief moments of reflection. Beatification process The beatification process was initiated in the Santiago archdiocese; initial steps towards opening the cause came on 16 December 2011 when the then- Archbishop (now cardinal) Ricardo Ezzati Andrello named the Enrique Alvear Urrutia Foundation as the official actor for promoting the cause. Ezzati later inaugurated the diocesan phase for the cause on 9 March 2012 and closed it later on 3 December 2014; during 2013 the Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) to the cause.

Blackjack is the most popular card game in the United States and was an addition to the casino. In a deal valued at $1.1 billion, former Governor Charlie Crist gave the Seminole Tribe a license for blackjack in its casinos. In exchange, The Seminole Tribe loaned the State of Florida $1.1 billion over the course of two years. On July 3, 2008, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that the governor's agreement was unconstitutional, but table games continue to operate because the Federal Department of the Interior approved the now-invalid pact with the state.

The Medici rose to prominence as Florence's preeminent bankers. They amassed a sizable fortune some of which was used for patronage of the arts. Michelangelo's first contact with the Medici family began early as a talented teenage apprentice of the Florentine painter Domenico Ghirlandaio. Following his initial work for Lorenzo de' Medici, Michelangelo's interactions with the family continued for decades including the Medici papacies of Pope Leo X and Pope Clement VII. Despite pauses and turbulence in the relationship between Michelangelo and his Medici patrons, it was commissions from the Medici Popes that produced some of Michelangelo's finest work, including the completion of the tomb of Pope Julius II with its monumental sculpture of Moses, and The Last Judgement, a complex fresco covering the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel (the earlier Sistine Chapel ceiling was not a Medici commission).  Beginnings with the Medici  Michelangelo's father sent him to study grammar with the Renaissance humanist Francesco da Urbino in Florence as a young boy. The young artist, however, showed no interest in his schooling, preferring to copy paintings from churches and seek the company of painters. At thirteen, Michelangelo was apprenticed to the painter Domenico Ghirlandaio. When Michelangelo was only fourteen, his father persuaded Ghirlandaio to pay his apprentice as an artist, which was highly unusual at the time. When in 1489 Lorenzo de' Medici (\\"Lorenzo il Magnifico), de facto ruler of Florence, asked Ghirlandaio for his two best pupils, Ghirlandaio sent Michelangelo and Francesco Granacci. Lorenzo had taken notice of Michelangelo's unusual talent and, wishing to encourage him, proposed for Michelangelo to move into the palace and live there as his son to be educated along with the Medici children. Lorenzo even offered Michelangelo's father Lodovico a respectable position in the palace. Michelangelo was thrown into the midst of the Medici circle, where he was involved with poetry, science, philosophy, and art. It was then that Michelangelo first began writing down his deepest thoughts in poetry, which he continued to do for the rest of his life. From 1490 to 1492, Michelangelo attended the Humanist academy which the Medici had founded. He absorbed Renaissance Neoplatonism through his direct contact with some of the great Renaissance humanist philosophers of the Medici Court. Consequently, both Michelangelo's outlook and his art were subject to the influence of many of the most prominent philosophers and writers of the day including Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola, and Angelo Poliziano. Michelangelo studied sculpture under Bertoldo di Giovanni. At this time Michelangelo sculpted the reliefs Madonna of the Steps (1490‚Äì1492) and Battle of the Centaurs (1491‚Äì1492). The latter was based on a subject suggested by Poliziano and was commissioned by Lorenzo de' Medici.  Brief separation from the Medici  Lorenzo de' Medici's death on April 8, 1492, brought a reversal of Michelangelo's circumstances. Michelangelo left the security of the Medici court and returned to his father's house. In the following months he carved a wooden crucifix (1493), as a gift to the prior of the Florentine church of Santo Spirito, who had permitted him some studies of anatomy on the corpses of the church's hospital. Between 1493 and 1494 he bought a block of marble for a larger than life statue of Hercules, which was sent to France and subsequently disappeared sometime around the 18th century. On January 20, 1494, after heavy snowfalls, Lorenzo's heir, Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici commissioned a snow statue, and Michelangelo again entered the court of the Medici. The Medici sixty-year reign came to an end under the reign of Piero Medici.The Genius of Michelangelo. Dir. William E. Wallace. The Teaching Company, 2007. DVD. In the same year, the Medici were expelled from Florence as the result of the rise of Girolamo Savonarola. Michelangelo left the city before the end of the political upheaval, moving to Venice and then to Bologna, where he stayed for more than a year. In Bologna he was commissioned to finish the carving of the last small figures of the Shrine of St. Dominic, in the church dedicated to that saint. According to Ascanio Condivi, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, for whom Michelangelo had sculpted St. John the Baptist, asked that Michelangelo \\"fix it so that it looked as if it had been buried\\" so he could \\"send it to Rome...pass [it off as] an ancient work and...sell it much better.\\" Both Lorenzo and Michelangelo were unwittingly cheated out of the real value of the piece by a middleman. Cardinal Raffaele Riario, to whom Lorenzo had sold it, discovered that it was a fraud, but was so impressed by the quality of the sculpture that he invited the artist to Rome. This apparent success in selling his sculpture abroad as well as the conservative Florentine situation may have encouraged Michelangelo to accept the prelate's invitation. Towards the end of 1494, the political situation in Florence was calmer. Upon his return to Florence, he found that things in the city had greatly changed. The city, previously under threat from the French, it was no longer in danger as Charles VIII had suffered defeats. Michelangelo returned to Florence but received no commissions from the new city government under Savonarola. He returned to the employment of the Medici. During the half year he spent in Florence he worked on two small statues, a child St. John the Baptist and a Sleeping Cupid.  Under the Medici Popes  Leo X = The new Pope Leo X was no stranger to Michelangelo, being no other than his old schoolmate Giovanni di Lorenzo de' Medici, the second son of Lorenzo the Magnificent. Since Leo was a Medici, one of the projects that naturally occurred to him was the decoration of the unfinished front of his family's church, San Lorenzo, in Florence. His predecessor Brunelleschi finished the interior and he had to finish the fa√ßade. In fact, Leo X invited several architects to do so and he was not among the first. However, when he made the woodcut in December 1516, in January 1518 he was given Leo's approval. In anticipation of the project, he went out the quarries in Carrara, Italy to excavate granite and he spent two years building the road to it, supervising the extraction, and transporting the marble to Florence. The church facade was actually his first architectural task, and he had no experience of producing the working plans and measurements needed for his project. The blocks of marble used in columns, cornices, and other architectural features were different from the ones he used in his sculptures.Michelangelo: artist and man. Dir. Michael Crain. Perpetual Motion Films, 1994. VHS. Michelangelo project for the fa√ßade of San Lorenzo, Florence The three years he spent in creating drawings and models for the facade, as well as attempting to open a new marble quarry at Pietrasanta were specifically for the project. Unfortunately, the project was delayed because of the building of new roads to transport the marble. Pope Leo X wanted to use the marble in quarries at Seravezza. It was an abandoned quarry and therefore had no workers and roads there. His opinion on the subject was ignored and was instructed to move the operation to Seravezza. Because of that, he was unjustly accused of breaking his contract with Carrara. Also, when he argued with the pope about it, he was accused of favoring Carrara marble over Seravezza's. After a delay of three years, the project was abruptly cancelled. The basilica lacks a fa√ßade to this day, and the reason for this cancellation remains a mystery to historians. However, it is still adorned by many people today. The New Sacristy of the Medici Chapel of San Lorenzo is the best example of the integration of the artist's sculptural and architectural vision since Michelangelo created both the major sculptures as well as the interior plan.James Beck, Antonio Paolucci, Bruni Santi Michelangelo. The Medici Chapel, Nhames and Hudson, New York,1994 Ironically, the most prominent tombs are those of two rather obscure Medici who died young, a son and grandson of Lorenzo il Magnifico. Lorenzo himself is buried in an unfinished and comparatively unimpressive tomb on one of the side walls of the chapel, not given a free-standing monument, as originally intended. Instead of returning to Rome, Michelangelo remained in Florence and agreed to continue the construction of the Medici Chapel. The Medici Chapel has monuments in it dedicated to certain members of the Medici family. Michelangelo never finished it, so his pupils later completed it. Lorenzo il Magnifico was buried at the entrance wall of the Medici Chapel. Sculptures of the \\"Madonna and Child\\" and the Medici patron Saints Cosmas and Damian were set over his burial. The Madonna and Child was Michelangelo's own work.

Peter Barenboim, \\"Michelangelo Drawings ‚Äì Key to the Medici Chapel Interpretation\\", Moscow, Letny Sad, 2006, = Clement VII = When Pope Leo X died, Adrian VI succeeded him but died within a year. He was succeeded by Pope Clement VII, the second Medici pope. Sophisticated, handsome, and intelligent, Pope Clement VII became one of Michelangelo's most important patrons ‚Äì despite Vatican coffers running low during his papacy, due to the extravagances of previous popes and a string of international misfortunes. Clement VII, also known as Giulio di Giuliano de' Medici, was the nephew of Lorenzo and the son of Giuliano de' Medici, who was assassinated in the Pazzi conspiracy in 1478. As with Leo X, Michelangelo was educated alongside Clement VII and for many years, the two communicated in great detail both via letter and in person. Despite that Clement VII was an illegitimate child, he became an archbishop via papal dispensation, in which Leo X stipulated that his parents had been secretly married. Thus, Giulio de' Medici was made cardinal in 1513 and in 1523 became pope. Numerous misfortunes occurred during his papacy, including the Sack of Rome, the English Reformation, and Martin Luther's ongoing Protestant Reformation. Reading room of the Laurentian Library Clement VII had plans to make the Laurentian Library public and in doing so, the Pope proposed creating a new building. Michelangelo was contracted and produced an amazing design but it was not carried out until he moved to Rome in 1525. In this project, Michelangelo produced new styles such as pilasters tapering thinner at the bottom, and a staircase with contrasting rectangular and curving forms. Michelangelo worked on these two projects off and on for the next thirteen years. Ultimately, it was finished after his death. Mere days before his own death, Clement VII commissioned Michelangelo to paint The Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel.  The legacy of Michelangelo after the Medici  In 1527, the Florentine citizens, encouraged by the Sack of Rome, threw out the Medici and restored the Republic. A siege of the city ensued, and Michelangelo went to the aid of his beloved Florence by working on the city's fortifications from 1528‚Äì29. The city fell in 1530, and the Medici were restored to power. Completely out of sympathy with the repressive reign of the ducal Medici, Michelangelo left Florence for good in the mid-1530s, leaving assistants to complete the Medici Chapel. He left Florence for the last time at the age of sixty, leaving the Medici Chapel unfinished. Michelangelo, Dying Slave, commissioned in 1505 for the tomb of Pope Julius II Michelangelo decided to settle in Rome, where he had hoped to finish Pope Julius II's tomb but was unable to do so, due to a new project that had been assigned to him by Pope Julius II. Thus Michelangelo set the tomb aside to paint a fresco in the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo was commissioned to do the tombs of Lorenzo de' Medici's grandson, Giuliano, duke of Nemours and Lorenzo's third son, and popes Leo X and Clement VII, both Medici; also Lorenzo il Magnifico. Only two were completed: Giuliano's and Lorenzo's. Although the construction of the monument of Pope Julius did not go according to plan, it was officially unveiled in February 1545. The original design had been cut down to something small and manageable with only three sculptured done by Michelangelo. Michelangelo, at seventy years old, had set a high standard for the following artists to come. People were already attempting to sum up his accomplishments and considering his place in history. From this time on, he was known as the 'Divine Michelangelo', a living legend, the master of Italian Renaissance. Yet old though he was, in 1547, Pope Paul III appointed him chief architect of St. Peter's Basilica, which he would work on for the rest of his life. Michelangelo died of old age, leaving the project unfinished. Though he devoted the last seventeen years of his life to this task, Michelangelo refused to accept anything. He said he did it for the good of his soul. Years later his body was brought back from Rome for interment at the Basilica di Santa Croce, fulfilling his last request to be buried in his beloved Tuscany.
