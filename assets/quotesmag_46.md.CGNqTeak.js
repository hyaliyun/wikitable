In June 1865, after the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery, George and a friend received free papers in the mail and set off to escape slavery, as they were still being held in bondage. When they arrived in Cincinnati, Ohio, they were hired as deck hands on the steam packet Sherman, working a route between Cincinnati and Wheeling, West Virginia. Later, in Cincinnati, George took a job at a number of hotels, including the Broadway House, Walnut Street House, Burnett House, and Spencer House. He became ill with smallpox while at the Walnut Street House, but recovered. He also began to attend night school taught by Luella Brown. He was reported to be a college graduate. On October 28, 1873, he moved to Chicago and took charge of the dining room at the Hotel Woodruff. In 1877 he married Patti R.

However, two 19-nortestosterone derivatives of vinyltestosterone, norvinisterone (17α-vinyl-19-nortestosterone) and norgesterone (17α-vinyl-δ5(10)-19-nortestosterone), have been marketed. They are used as progestins for female hormonal contraception, rather than as AAS. Vinyltestosterone is a relatively weak AAS. In one study, it showed approximately one-third and one-fifth of the respective androgenic and anabolic activity of other AAS such as nandrolone (19-nortestosterone), methyltestosterone (17α-methyltestosterone), and ethyltestosterone (17α-ethyltestosterone) in castrated male rats, whereas ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone) showed almost no androgenic and anabolic activity (only 1/20th the anabolic potency of vinyltestosterone). Additionally, in women with metastatic breast cancer, vinyltestosterone was found to be ineffective in treating the disease (unlike other AAS such as testosterone propionate or fluoxymesterone) and produced little or no virilization in the women at a dosage of 100 mg intramuscularly three times per week.

Ismael's Ghosts premiered at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival as the opening film. Plot A film director named Ismaël is working on his next film starring Ivan. It is based on his estranged brother and tells the story of a diplomat who is possibly a spy. In the middle of the night, Ismaël receives a phone call from Henri. Ismaël was married to Henri's daughter Carlotta, who has been missing for 20 years and presumed dead. Ismaël has a relationship with an astrophysicist named Sylvia now. Carlotta suddenly appears in front of them. Ismaël does not show up to the set. He accidentally shoots the film's producer in the arm.

The name of Marion Cotillard's character, Carlotta, derives from Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo. The title of the film is an homage to Norman Mailer's novel Harlot's Ghost. Bob Dylan's song It Ain't Me Babe was used in a scene from the film. The film includes quotes from Jacques Lacan's Seminar VIII, Rainer Maria Rilke's Schlaflied, and Philip Roth's American Pastoral.

History  The service was created in 1889 as a section in the Prussian General Staff, given the name Sektion IIIb. At the beginning of World War I, the section was upgraded to a department and renamed Abteilung IIIb. Its initial responsibility solely consisted of counterintelligence, and its foreign intelligence capabilities were limited. The focus of the counterintelligence was on France and Russia, the navy being responsible for intelligence on the United Kingdom. In 1917, an explicit authorization for domestic education was adopted. The secret IIIb was developed under its last head, Walter Nicolai, as war increased the need for a secret police force. Never before had a German intelligence group held such influence in the German Reich. At the end of the war, the division was disbanded. After the war began, the network of agents in enemy countries was quickly removed as the agents were arrested. The Secret Service could not provide information about enemy intentions and operational deployment plans. At the General Staff, within the News Department, the 'enemy editor' grew more suspicious of what was delivered as facts. The intelligence reports often proved to be wrong. In the assessment of the enemy situation, there was one mishap after another. The fundamental error lay in the separation of news gathering and analysis. As the war progressed, it increasingly became a secret police and propaganda organization. The head of the secret police, Nicolai, was in the left press among other things a \\"father of lies\\" and disinformation. In addition, the A III b had a massive competition with the Naval Intelligence, also called'News Department', and the intelligence operations of the Foreign Office became exposed.  Outline  During the First World War, the division was significantly upgraded and divided into press, propaganda, intelligence and defense: ; Mobile Division III b : Counterintelligence in operational territory : Counterintelligence in occupied territory : News service / press : Neutral military attachés ; Deputy Division III b : Counterintelligence in Germany : News service / press : Politics ; War press office : Information agency : Upper censorship : Auslandsstelle : Domestic spot  Bibliography  * Heinz Höhne: Canaris - Patriot in the twilight.

History Robertson, a cousin of Robert Louis Stevenson, was born in London to William Robertson (c. 1814 – 6 May 1891), who was a follower of Dr. Thomas Chalmers during the Church of Scotland schism, and his wife Jane Stevenson Robertson ( – 13 October 1892). William became a Congregationalist under the influence of Rev. Samuel Martin, who baptised the young Joseph. They emigrated Australia, and settled in Ipswich, Queensland, before moving to Camdenville, New South Wales, where William was employed as a timber merchant, and Joseph was educated. He worked for the Panama, New Zealand and Australian Mail Company for five years, then was influenced by the missionary James Chalmers to prepare for missionary work. He began night studies at the Sydney School of Arts, winning prizes in English, Latin and Greek. He then studied privately for a year under Rev. B. Quaife, then entered Camden College, where he studied theology under Rev. S. C. Kent and Rev. Dr. Fraser in conjunction with his course at Sydney University, where he was captain of the Rugby Football Club. He graduated BA in 1873, and was offered the pastorate of the Augustine Congregational Church, Hawthorn, Victoria, where he served for three years from 1872 to 1875. He completed his MA in 1877. He served at of the Beresford Street Congregational Church, Auckland from 1877 to January 1886, and oversaw its rapid expansion, with the establishment of Mount Eden and three other branch churches. While there he helped found the Congregational Union of New Zealand in 1884, and was its first chairman. He was minister of the church in Petersham, New South Wales from December 1886 to June 1890, during which time the church was enlarged and a fine organ installed. He was called to take charge of Stow Memorial Church, Adelaide during the absence of W. Roby Fletcher, who had resigned for travel purposes, and commenced at Stow in August, 1890, Rev. D. W. Simon D.D. (invariably referred to as \\"Principal Simon\\") having filled in for the interim. Principal D. W. Simon, D.D., of Spring Hill College, Birmingham, was a noted Congregationalist theologian. He was chairman of the Congregational Union in the year 1894-5. Among his achievements was placing the church on a firm financial footing, with a modest surplus where there had been a substantial mortgage of £4,000 and overdraft of £500. He left Stow in 1904 to take charge of Clayton Congregational Church, Adelaide's other major Congregational chapel. He left Clayton Church in February 1909, again with the proud record of seeing church debt wiped out, and membership and attendance of both church and Sunday-school at an all-time high, and a good attendance at mid-week services. While in Adelaide he was an active supporter of the YMCA, O.B.I. and Christian Endeavour, the Missionary Training Home, the Anti- Gambling League, and the Deaf and Dumb Institution. His next call was to the Central Congregational Church in Ipswich, Queensland, a church with twelve branches and four assistant ministers, where Rev. W. J. L. Closs BA. had served from 1899 to 1908. Attendances were low for some time, then picked up around 1912. When The Great War broke out many men from Ipswich volunteered, and some did not return, including one of Robertson's sons, killed at Gallipoli. Robertson resigned in April 1916The story of the years : Central Congregational Church Ipswich, Qld., 1853–1953 published by Centenary Committee, Ipswich Central Congregational Church, available on-line and retired from Ipswich in July 1916, and was replaced by F. V. Dowling MA. He accepted a temporary charge of the Campbell Memorial Church at Roseville, New South Wales where he served from September 1916, followed by Randwick and Redfern churches. He died at Strathfield, New South Wales. He was described in 1953 as > \\"A man of sound scholarship, of Old World dignity and a good simple preacher > (who) went about his work steadily ... Mr. and Mrs. Robertson were a tower > of strength, and themselves knew the fellowship of loss and suffering.\\" Family Joseph Robertson married Catherine Ross Wilson (c. 1854 – 10 April 1939), adopted daughter of Rev. S. C. Kemt, Principal of Camden College, on 6 January 1875.

Similar to proton exchange membrane fuel cells and solid oxide fuel cells, they extract electricity from the electrochemical conversion of hydrogen- and oxygen-containing gases, leaving only water as a byproduct. Current SAFC systems use hydrogen gas obtained from a range of different fuels, such as industrial-grade propane and diesel. They operate at mid-range temperatures, from 200 to 300 °C.Calum R.I.

Merle. \\"Solid acids as fuel cell electrolytes.\\" Nature 410, 910-913 (19 April 2001). doi:10.1038/35073536. Solid acids of interest for fuel cell applications are those whose chemistry is based on oxyanion groups (SO42-, PO43−, SeO42−, AsO43−) linked together by hydrogen bonds and charge-balanced by large cation species (Cs+, Rb+, NH4+, K+). At low temperatures, solid acids have an ordered molecular structure like most salts. At warmer temperatures (between 140 and 150 degrees Celsius for CsHSO4), some solid acids undergo a phase transition to become highly disordered \\"superprotonic\\" structures, which increases conductivity by several orders of magnitude. When used in fuel cells, this high conductivity allows for efficiencies of up to 50% on various fuels.“SAFCell – Oil and Gas.” http://www.safcell.com/oil-gas/ The first proof-of-concept SAFCs were developed in 2000 using cesium hydrogen sulfate (CsHSO4). However, fuel cells using acid sulfates as an electrolyte result in byproducts that severely degrade the fuel cell anode, which leads to diminished power output after only modest usage.Ryan B. Merle, Calum R. I. Chisholm, Dane A. Boysen, Sossina M. Haile. \\"Instability of Sulfate and Selenate Solid Acids in Fuel Cell Environments.\\" Energy Fuels, 2003, 17 (1), pp 210–215.

DOI: 10.1039/B604311A When undergoing a superprotonic phase transition, CsH2PO4 experiences an increase in conductivity by four orders of magnitude. In 2005, it was shown that CsH2PO4 could stably undergo the superprotonic phase transition in a humid atmosphere at an \\"intermediate\\" temperature of 250 °C, making it an ideal solid acid electrolyte to use in a fuel cell. A humid environment in a fuel cell is necessary to prevent certain solid acids (such as CsH2PO4) from dehydration and dissociation into a salt and water vapor.  Electrode Reactions  Hydrogen gas is channeled to the anode, where it is split into protons and electrons. Protons travel through the solid acid electrolyte to reach the Cathode, while electrons travel to the cathode through an external circuit, generating electricity. At the cathode, protons and electrons recombine along with oxygen to produce water that is then removed from the system. Anode: H2 → 2H+ \\\\+ 2e− Cathode: ½O2 \\\\+ 2H+ \\\\+ 2e− → H2O Overall: H2 \\\\+ ½O2 → H2O The operation of SAFCs at mid-range temperatures allows them to utilize materials that would otherwise be damaged at high temperatures, such as standard metal components and flexible polymers. These temperatures also make SAFCs tolerant to impurities in their hydrogen source of fuel, such as carbon monoxide or sulfur components. For example, SAFCs can utilize hydrogen gas extracted from propane, natural gas, diesel, and other hydrocarbons.Cheap Diesel-Powered Fuel Cells. Bullis, Kevin. October 21, 2010. MIT Technology Review.Diesel: The Fuel of the Future? February 11, 2013. Discovery News.Running fuel cells on biodiesel. Claude R. Olsen, Else Lie. October 8, 2010. The Research Council of Norway.  Fabrication and Production  Sossina Haile developed the first solid acid fuel cells in the 1990s. In 2005, SAFCs were fabricated with thin electrolyte membranes of 25 micrometer thickness, resulting in an eightfold increase in peak power densities compared to earlier models. Thin electrolyte membranes are necessary to minimize the voltage lost due to internal resistance within the membrane. According to Suryaprakash et al. 2014, the ideal solid acid fuel cell anode is a \\"porous electrolyte nanostructure uniformly covered with a platinum thin film.\\" This group used a method called spray drying to fabricate SAFCs, depositing CsH2PO4 solid acid electrolyte nanoparticles and creating porous, 3-dimensional interconnected nanostructures of the solid acid fuel cell electrolyte material CsH2PO4.  Applications  Because of their moderate temperature requirements and compatibility with several types of fuel, SAFCs can be utilized in remote locations where other types of fuel cells would be impractical. In particular, SAFC systems for remote oil and gas applications have been deployed to electrify wellheads and eliminate the use of pneumatic components, which vent methane and other potent greenhouse gases straight into the atmosphere. A smaller, portable SAFC system is in development for military applications that will run on standard logistic fuels, like marine diesel and JP8.SAFCell Inc. awarded Enhancement grant from US Army.

The character was portrayed by Mahershala Ali in the first season of the Netflix television series Luke Cage set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Publication history The character first appeared in Luke Cage, Power Man #18 (June 1974) in a story written by Len Wein and drawn by George Tuska. Cornell Cottonmouth, or just Cottonmouth, started out as a drug kingpin in New York City. He was involved in the events that led to Luke Cage gaining super powers and becoming \\"Power Man\\". Cottonmouth tried to recruit Cage to his organization, but was ultimately knocked out and turned over to police by Cage. During the \\"Shadowland\\" storyline, Cottonmouth returned as part of Nightshade's gang, Flashmob where they come into conflict with Daredevil as well as a new Power Man, who, like his predecessor, knocked Cottonmouth out and turned him over to police. Fictional character biography Not much is known about Cornell Cottonmouth's history except that he has established himself as a drug lord in New York. When Willis Stryker wanted to frame Carl Lucas, he stole a shipment of heroin from Cottonmouth's organization.Luke Cage, Hero for Hire #1. Marvel Comics. Upon changing his name to Luke Cage, Carl decided to track down the drugs that were used to frame him. Cage used a number of informants in his search. The informant Flea was successful in his search yet his investigations were discovered. Before dying from the poisons inflicted on him by Cottonmouth's men, Flea managed to inform Cage of his discovery.Power Man #18 Upon learning who sent Flea to infiltrate his organization, Cottonmouth got the idea of recruiting Cage to his organization. He sent his trademark snakes to Luke's office \\"to show him that he means business.\\" Cottonmouth then sent his henchmen Mike and Ike to make an offer to Luke. Luke managed to take out the snakes and defeat Mike and Ike. Mike ended up snitching to Luke where Cottonmouth was located. Luke agreed to join Cottonmouth's organization (to learn where his records were kept). Cottonmouth then began to test Cage's loyalty by sending him to steal a shipment of heroin from the rival crimeboss, Morgan. After Cage's success, he earned Cottonmouth's trust and began working for him until Cottonmouth caught Cage attempting to steal his records. Cottonmouth attacked Luke and was assisted by his henchman Slick. Cage then knocked Cottonmouth into Slick who fell out a window to his death. When Cottonmouth stated that the supposed records were in Slick's mind, Luke slammed Cottonmouth into an oak desk where Cottonmouth fell unconscious. Cage then called the police to come pick up Cottonmouth.Power Man #19-20. Marvel Comics. During the 2010 \\"Shadowland\\" storyline, Cottonmouth appeared as a member of Nightshade's gang called the Rivals. Cottonmouth established a section of turf where he sold drugs and hired out prostitutes only for him to be attacked by Hand ninjas that were sent by Daredevil. However, Power Man arrived dispersing the Hand ninjas and then Power Man broke Cottonmouth's teeth.Shadowland: Power Man #1. Marvel Comics. Cottonmouth later had his broken teeth replaced by gold-capped sharp teeth. When Power Man was apparently beaten and defeated by five corrupt police officers, Cottonmouth prepared to bite off a part of Power Man's face only to be leashed by Nightshade. At first, Cottonmouth was surprised when Nightshade offered Power Man to become her enforcer. Cottonmouth then became pleased when Nightshade had set up Power Man to fight Iron Fist.Shadowland: Power Man #3. Marvel Comics. To Nightshade's surprise, Power Man managed to side with Iron Fist and knocked out Cottonmouth while Nightshade escaped.Shadowland: Power Man #4. Marvel Comics. During the 2011 \\"Spider-Island\\" storyline, Cottonmouth alongside Nightshade and Flashmob (consisting of Chemistro, Cheshire Cat, Commanche, Dontrell \\"Cockroach\\" Hamilton, Mr. Fish, and Spear) tried to leave a spider-infested Manhattan by crossing a bridge only to be stopped by Misty Knight and her Heroes for Hire (consisting of Black Cat, Falcon, Gargoyle, Paladin, and Silver Sable).Spider-Island: Heroes for Hire #1. Marvel Comics. Cottonmouth next appears as one of the competitors in an underground fight club that is broken up by Deadpool, Gambit, and Fat Cobra. Cottonmouth was at some point arrested and imprisoned in Ryker's Island, which he escapes from during a riot that occurs during \\"Civil War II\\". With all of his assets either seized by the FBI or appropriated by Tombstone, a desperate Cottonmouth reaches out to Piranha Jones for help, and is convinced by Jones to side with him and Black Cat in an upcoming war for control of Harlem. Unimpressed by the duo's plans, Cottonmouth abandons them in favor of joining Alex Wilder's New Pride. Powers and abilities Cottonmouth has super-strength that rivals Luke Cage. He also has sharp teeth that he had sharpened to resemble fangs; combined with his jaw-strength they are capable of piercing Cage's \\"unbreakable\\" skin. Cottonmouth also has a good knowledge of different poisons. Other versions Cottonmouth appears in the Marvel Comics 2 series The Amazing Spider-Girl as the head of The Bronx branch of Black Tarantula's criminal empire. When a new villain called the Crimelord acquires and attempts to sell the Kingpin's files, Cottonmouth attends the auction for them in Black Tarantula's stead. The auction being crashed by the Hobgoblin and Spider-Girl leads to Cottonmouth and most of the other criminals present being arrested by the NYPD. In other media =Television= Mahershala Ali as Cornell \\"Cottonmouth\\" Stokes in the television series Luke Cage. Cornell Bertram \\"Cottonmouth\\" Stokes appears in Luke Cage, portrayed by Mahershala Ali, while his younger appearance is portrayed by Elijah Boothe. His nickname \\"Cottonmouth\\" comes from an incident in his childhood when several of his teeth were knocked out. He despises this nickname, snapping with rage at its merest mention, and insists upon being addressed as by his legal name. Cottonmouth is known to kill people with his bare hands and is capable of crushing a victim's skull while suffering nothing more than a few cuts on his knuckles. In his youth, Cottonmouth was part of a gang alongside Pop. In public, Cottonmouth is the owner of the nightclub Harlem's Paradise, but in private is a major arms dealer, working with his cousin, city councilwoman Mariah Dillard. During his time, he was assisted by Diamondback's minion Shades. Similar to Wilson Fisk, Cottonmouth also has several corrupt police officers on his payroll including Lt. Perez and Misty Knight's own partner Rafael Scarfe. Cottonmouth first appears on Luke's radar after a couple of street thugs decide to rob a gun deal between him and Domingo Colon. In the course of eliminating the thieves, Pop gets killed in a botched hit on the last thug, Chico Diaz. As retaliation for Pop's death, Luke attacks Cottonmouth's stash houses, costing him 80% of his money. Scarfe finds out about Luke's actions from Chico, kills him, and sells Luke out to Cottonmouth. Cottonmouth tries to kill Luke by blowing him up in Genghis Connie's with a rocket launcher, but Luke survives the building collapse. Outraged at Luke's refusal to die, Cottonmouth orders his men to begin shaking down local businesses for what he calls a \\"Luke Cage stupidity tax\\" in hopes of driving Luke out of Harlem, but Luke rallies to help the victims recover their money and possessions. Meanwhile, Scarfe, who has found himself under investigation internally by the NYPD, decides to blackmail Cottonmouth for $100,000. Cottonmouth instead shoots him and leaves him to bleed out. Scarfe dies that night, but not without first telling Luke and Claire everything he knows about Cottonmouth's operation. Cottonmouth is subsequently arrested and perp-walked out of Harlem's Paradise, but the Stokes' family lawyer Benjamin Donovan bails him out. While dealing with the fallout, Cottonmouth gets into a heated argument with Mariah about their upbringing, in which Cottonmouth shames Mariah for her rapes at the hands of their uncle Pete. Mariah, whose secret daughter Tilda is a product of said rapes, does not take the insinuation well, and throws Cottonmouth out his office window before beating him to death with a microphone stand. Mariah pins the blame for his death on Luke. At the end of the season, she later shifts the blame of Cottonmouth's death onto Diamondback. Despite Cottonmouth's death, his presence is not forgotten in season 2. It is revealed that Cottonmouth was close with Mariah's daughter Tilda. She is seen laying a rose at his grave prior to working with Bushmaster to help him take out Mariah at Harlem's Paradise. The attempt fails, and Misty is able to arrest Mariah for Cottonmouth's murder among other crimes, although she's poisoned in jail by Tilda before she can be tried.

He was the eldest of eleven children born to a master tailor who later became City Treasurer.Sigurd Schultz. Carl Rasmussen Dansk Biografisk Leksikon, Gyldendal. At fifteen, he went to Copenhagen to learn the hosiery trade and completed his training in 1861. While there, however, he was attracted to the art works he saw and took drawing lessons with the architects Hans J. Holm (1835–1916) and Christian Vilhelm Nielsen (1833-1910). Later, he took lessons with the animal painter Didrik Frisch (1835–1867).Hanne Poulsen J.E.C. Rasmussen Danmark & Weilbach Kunstnerleksikon. In need of some immediate income, he took passage as a cabin boy on a relative's merchant ship and visited Scotland; painting several works along the way. Upon returning, he enrolled in courses at the Copenhagen Technical College to improve his understanding of perspective. He studied until 1866 with the landscape painter, Carl Frederik Aagaard (1833–1895). His first showing was at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1863. He would exhibit there regularly until his death. Inspired by his sailing experience, he visited Greenland in 1870-71, making sketches that later became paintings, one of which was purchased for the Royal Collection. In 1872, he was able to obtain a scholarship to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, which led him through the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy and galleries in Paris, Dresden and Berlin. By 1880, he had become successful enough to marry his cousin Anna Egidia Rasmussen (1852-1931) with whom he would have eight children. He bought a home and establish a studio in Marstal on Ærø. His first work there was a large mural at Marstal Church, depicting Jesus calming the waters, which featured portraits of prominent local citizens. In 1893, he was returning from Greenland on the brig Peru when he apparently fell overboard and drowned. He died between Orkney and Shetland. He was last seen by the helmsman, standing aft with his easel. When he was reported missing, an extensive search of the area was conducted, but they were unable to find him. His life became the subject of a novel Sidste rejse (Stockholm: Ordfront förlag. 2007) by Carsten Jensen. The largest collection of his works is at the Marstal Søfartsmuseum in Ærø, the M/S Maritime Museum of Denmark in Helsingør, Svendborg Museum, Ribe Kunstmuseum and Christiansborg Palace. Gallery I.

Brinham was born in Brixham in Devon. He left school at the age of fifteen and completed an apprenticeship as a joiner, becoming a member of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers (ASW). Brinham also became active in the Labour Party, and was soon elected as secretary of its Torquay division.\\"Obituary: Mr George Brinham\\", The Guardian, 23 November 1962 In 1947, Brinham was elected to the executive of the ASW, and in 1956 he became the union's youngest ever chairman. From 1952 to 1954, he also served on the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions. He was known for being on the right-wing of the trade union movement, and was considered a poor public speaker, but came to prominence through his hard work on committees. In 1953, Brinham was elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party, where he strongly supported Hugh Gaitskell. In 1959/60, he was Chair of the party, during which time he arranged for the formation of a youth section, the Young Socialists. The following year, he was a leading figure in the movement to reverse the party's unilateralist nuclear disarmament policy. Brinham was killed in 1962 while at home, by an eighteen-year-old man, Thomas Somers, who hit him with a decanter. Somers claimed that Brinham had made \\"homosexual advances\\" toward him.

It was the second spinoff, and the first off-road racing edition, in the Asphalt series. It was released on 27 October 2016. Development lasted from August 2015 to September 2017. Development has been terminated after 60 people layoffs and following the Madrid studio shutdown.  Gameplay  The video game features a lineup of rally cars, monster trucks and a vast amount of snowy tracks and dirt. The visual interface, angular camera view and vehicular design of the game have a strong visual resemblance to the MotorStorm video game series. While the controls are the same as the previous Asphalt games, the nitro mechanics are different. Normally, there are three nitro \\"Segments\\", and using Extra nitro booster, the number of segments are increased to four. Perfect nitro was renamed to long nitro. Triple nitro activates all three or four bars at the same time for added speed. When the race starts, the vehicles are given 2 nitro segments. Different types of vehicles acquire boost at different rates based on certain play styles, e.g. Buggies gain large amounts of nitro from performing airborne stunts, while SUVs perform drifts to maintain their boost. The vehicle gameplay mechanics also have an effect on the game. Lighter vehicles like buggies and rally cars are in general aerodynamic and will pull off aerial stunts easily, while heavier vehicles like trucks and SUVs struggle to perform the same task and will also gain less boost as a result. Infected mode has been carried over from Asphalt 8, albeit with several changes. Compared to Asphalt 8, there are more ways to get infected in Asphalt Xtreme, but infected players start out with less infected time. Players are now able to extend their infected time by performing aerial stunts and drifting. Also, when the infected timer runs out, players do not wreck as with Asphalt 8, but rather lose their Infected state and gain a full tank of Nitro. There were thirty-five licensed cars initially available in Asphalt Xtreme, as well as thirty-one more cars added through updates. The cars were divided into five classes and seven categories, and their performance was determined by the Rank rating feature, carried over from Asphalt 8. Asphalt Xtreme featured five different locations at release, as well as three more locations added through updates. Each location featured multiple layouts.  Soundtrack  Asphalt Xtreme soundtrack features artists such as Rise Against, Eagles of Death Metal, Finger Eleven, Nothing But Thieves, The Dead Weather, Barns Courtney, Wavves, Cage the Elephant, Drenge, Battle Tapes, Ratatat, Monster Truck, DJ Tiësto, Swanky Tunes, and more.  Development  The game is rumored to have the same physics engine as Asphalt 8: Airborne and Asphalt Nitro. Asphalt Xtreme is an off-road racing game in the Asphalt series. In the Asphalt 8 update, in Rio, appears a billboard with a poster of Asphalt Xtreme.

Biography She studied literature at the University of Santiago de Cuba beginning in December 1964. After marrying her first husband, she moved to Havana and finished her schooling at the University of Havana. In 1965 she gave birth to her daughter María Josefina, \\"and soon after came the divorce.\\" It was at her first alma mater that she debuted as a poet, with the book El viento en la pared. This was published thanks to her professor, the Mexican Eraclio Cepeda, for the University of Santiago de Cuba's Department of Public Extension in 1962. That year she competed in Cuba's main literary event with Tiempos de sol, which received honorable mention for the Casa de las Américas Prize. She met the poet Heberto Padilla, who also received honorable mention in that competition (with El justo tiempo humano) and would become her partner five years later. The following year she repeated her success, obtaining another mention for the award with Cartas a Ana Frank. She began to work as a journalist at Hoy in 1965, and afterward moved to the newspaper Granma, from which, she says, she was fired in 1967. In 1966 she again saw Padilla, when he returned from Czechoslovakia, and at the end of the next year they began living together. They were officially married on 25 January 1971. Although Cuza Malé worked for Granma, she says she never had \\"any revolutionary enthusiasm\\". About this time she says: Cuza Malé was arrested on 20 March 1971, following the recital given by Padilla in the Union of Writers, where he had read Provocaciones. Both were accused of \\"counterrevolutionary activities\\" against the government, but she was only held incommunicado for three days in the barracks of Villa Marista (Padilla was held for 37) and participated in the self-denouncement meeting held at the Union of Writers when her husband was released. Her book Juego de damas was the third which received mention for the Casa de las Américas Prize (in 1968), an excerpt of which appeared in the anthology 8 poetas. In 1971, the already-published collection of poems from the Union of Writers and Artists of Cuba was destroyed due to the arrest of Cuza Malé and Padilla. It would be reissued 31 years later by Término Editorial of Cincinnati. Cuza Malé's parents had abandoned Cuba in 1966 and lived in Miami. This allowed her, in 1979, to escape to the United States with Ernesto, the son she had had with Padilla, who at the time was six years old. The next year, thanks to international pressure and particularly the efforts of Senator Edward Kennedy, her husband was able to follow. Exile At first, Cuza Malé stayed with her parents, but she later had to move, as the Cuban government warned that her husband would not be allowed to emigrate if she did not leave Miami. She opted to go to Elizabeth, New Jersey, to the house of her childhood friend Elkes Arjona. There she worked as an administrator in a Cuban clothing store, and later in other places, illegally, as she had tourist status and could not seek asylum for fear of reprisals that Cuba might take against Padilla and her daughter. (María Josefina was 13 years old when Cuza Malé left the island, and 18 years passed before she was able to see her again.) In Princeton in 1982 – in collaboration with Padilla, who had initially opposed the idea – Cuza Malé founded Linden Lane Magazine, specializing in art and literature of Cubans in exile. In 1986, she founded the Cuban cultural center and art gallery La Casa Azul in Fort Worth, Texas, where she had moved. After the death of Padilla in 2000, this institution took his name in tribute to his memory. Cuza Malé had separated from the poet in 1995. About religion and her mystical side, she explained in 2008: Cuza Malé resides in Fort Worth, Tx. In addition to poetry, Cuza Malé has dabbled in fiction and has at least three unpublished novels.

AD 542), King of Connacht, although the Middle Irish poem Caithréim Cellaig says he was buried on Knocknarea and reburied on an island in Lough Gill. Animal and human bones were discovered on the site as well as a flint flake. Description The tomb is very large, 30 m (100 ft) long. The court is oval and located in the centre with two chambers at one end and a single chamber at the other, giving it the appearance of a man from above. The central court is not a perfect oval but is crooked in the middle, indicating that there was originally one court cairn which was then added to.

In the course of taking reference photographs of the scene he accidentally took a picture in which the Princess could be seen reflected in a mirror. The Princess took offense to this and ordered her bodyguard to beat the man and then forced him at gunpoint to apologize and kiss her feet, an act the craftsman found to be extremely humiliating.

VZ, ventricular zone; SVZ, subventricular zone; IZ, intermediate zone; SP, subplate; CP, cortical plate; MZ, marginal zone; RG, radial glia; MN, migrating neuron; TR, thalamic radiation; CC, cortico-cortical axons. E## represents post-conceptional age of macaque monkey. The Radial Unit Hypothesis (RUH) is a conceptual theory of cerebral cortex development, first described by Pasko Rakic. The RUH states that the cerebral cortex develops during embryogenesis as an array of interacting cortical columns, or 'radial units', each of which originates from a transient stem cell layer called the ventricular zone, which contains neural stem cells known as radial glial cells. Cortical evolution The reiterative nature of the cerebral cortex, in the sense that it is a vast array of repeating functional circuits, led to the idea that cortical evolution is governed by mechanisms regulating the addition of cortical columns, enabling additional functional areas to become specialized and incorporated into the brain. The addition of new radial units is thought to depend on control of the cell cycle (proliferation) of cortical stem cells lining the ventricular system in the ventricular zone and subventricular zone. Protomap Intimately related to the RUH is the 'protomap' hypothesis, which states that the primordial identity of each functional area of the cerebral cortex is encoded within the cortical stem cells prior to the formation of the cortical layers. Within each developing radial unit, the process of neurogenesis gives rise to post-mitotic (non- dividing) cortical neurons, which begin the process of radial neuronal migration from the ventricular zone and adjacent subventricular zone to form the cortical plate in the classic 'inside-out' manner beginning with the deep cortical layers. Once their final destination is achieved, cortical neurons begin to form circuits with other cortical and subcortical neurons, often taking on a columnar shape following the radial migration route. Some localized lateral dispersion takes place during cortical column development in the mouse, but the degree of dispersion is molecularly regulated and indeed could vary across species. Principles of development Together, the RUH and protomap hypothesis represent two core principles of early cerebral cortex development. After neurons arrive in the cortical plate, other processes—especially activity-dependent processes—govern the maturation of cortical circuitry.

Location The power station would be located in Baharini Village, near the town of Mpeketoni, in Lamu County, approximately west of the location of Port Lamu. This is approximately , by road, south-east of Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. The plan involves the construction of 38 turbines on a piece of real estate measuring . The project is expected to displace over 600 families, who will be compensated to relocate. Overview As part of efforts to diversify the energy sources in Kenya, Kenwinds Holdings, a private company, plans to establish a 90 MW wind farm in Mpeketoni Division at the Kenyan coast in Lamu County. The planned wind station will sit on of land and consist of 38 wind turbines. The power generated will be evacuated via a new , 220 kV power line from Lamu to Rabai, where it will be integrated into the national grid. Development partners The power station will be owned and operated by Kenwind Holdings Limited, a Kenyan corporation. Kenwind Holdings is a subsidiary of Electrawinds, a Belgian energy company, which is collaborating on the project. The International Finance Corporation, a branch of the World Bank is providing a portion of the budgeted US$$235 million financing. Land dispute In March 2017, Cordisons International Limited, an American wind-energy developer, went to court to challenge Kenwind Holdings Limited's right to the piece of property on which the development will sit. In May 2018, Kenwind Holdings Limited, the Belgian company, prevailed in court and retained the rights to develop this power station. Recent developments In February 2020, the developers of this power station signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Kenya Power and Lighting Company, the country's electricity transmission and distribution monopoly. The electricity is expected to cost US$0.07 per kilowatt-hour (kWh).

He was working as an independent artist by 1473, when he painted a fresco of the Crucifixion (now fragmentary) at they abbey of San Cassiano at Montescolari, near Figline Valdarno. In 1474 he painted two fresco lunettes of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel in the refectory of the Abbey at Passignano in the Val di Pesa. In 1484 he painted a Madonna della Cintola with Saints for San Piero a Sieve in the Mugello, now in the Princeton University Art Museum.Princeton University Art Museum. 1489 he painted the trompe l'oeil architecture and lilies on the walls of the Sala dei Gigli in the Palazzo Vecchio of Florence. An altarpiece of the Madonna and Child with Four Saints, dated 1497, is over the high altar of San Matteo in Terrossola, near Bibbiena. In 1499 Bernardo was paid to modify Bernardo Daddi's fourteenth-century altarpiece in the Rucellai chapel of San Pancrazio in Florence; Daddi's polyptych is now at the New Orleans Museum of Art, but Bernardo's additions are lost. Bernardo's fresco of the Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian at the Oratorio della Compagnia di San Sebastiano at San Martino a Sveglia, near Fiesole, is dated 1502. Undated works include two fragmentary altarpieces (a Madonna and Child Enthroned and a Lamentation Over the Dead Christ) at Santa Maria a Brucianesi near Lastra a Signa, and dozens of panels of the Virgin and Child for domestic interiors.

The fungus has also been located on wood rot, plant species, and compost. A significant portion of P. setifera reports are found on sources with no previous association with the fungus. There are no known human cases of fungal infection, but one reported case of a dolphin infection. The fungus may have immunosuppressive characteristics, but it has not been confirmed. Many properties of the fungus are unknown, requiring further research. History and taxonomy Petriella setifera was first discovered on horse dung by A. Schmidt in Germany 1912. In this discovery, the fungus was categorized as a species of Microascus. It was later determined as a wood fungus by L. Shigo in 1957 when it was collected from a wilted oak tree in West Virginia. Since the discovery, the fungus was found in a variety of environments including wood and soil areas. This fungus was renamed under the genus Petriella in 1930 for reasons currently unknown. Further analysis of the fungus concluded there are multiple stages of development, including Schmidt\`s discovery of the fungus in teleomorph phase. In 1961 Barron reported on the Sporotrichum and Graphium anamorph stages of the fungus in isolations from soil. A year later, A.L Shigoon reported the fungus in Tokyo and other regions of the globe including the United States. The fungus continues to be found in other regions, classified under P. setifera. Morphology and physiology All species in the genus Petriella have a Graphium state, characterized by dark synnemata and round, single-celled spores in the mucus. Dimorphic pore openings produce condia to form mucoid balls at the synnemata apex, which is similarly found in Lectographium lundbergii. The spores are sexual, non-motile condiophores. The perithecium in which the sexual spores are borne is pale to dark brown colour, 75-125μm in diameter with scattered hairs along the neck. It is thought that expression of the slime-spored Graphium may be induced by certain environmental conditions. In the laboratory, asymmetric ascospores were found at room temperature when the fungus was grown on a PDA plate. Clusters of brown-grey chlamydospores have been isolated on the agar. These spores were only found in P. boulangeri previously, but it is believed P. setifera developed chlamydospores to survive in the soil. The asymmetrical ascospore convex and marked germinal pores are unique to P. setifera. The Graphium stage has been associated with fungal reproduction, while the Sporotrichum state has the largest growth and branching. Hyphae are found to form many condia near the apical end during the Sporotrichum stage. CMCase which is also known as cellulase, can be produced by P. setifera optimally at 55 °C and a pH 6.0. The fungus is stable between pH 5.0-8.0 and at temperatures below 45 °C. In-vitro CMCase production has been linked to increased Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, EDTA and Mn2+ levels in the agar and a severe decrease in Fe2+, Pb2+, Al3+, Zn2+, Fe3+ and Cu2+. Pathology and medical uses A single case of infection has been reported from a bottlenose dolphin. Petriella setifera has no known infectious properties for humans or other species. Petriella strains have rarely been associated with vertebrate infections. However, all species in the genus have not been fully analyzed for pathology. The fungus is known to have antifungal properties. Ethyl acetate extracts from the fungus show activity against fungal pathogens of plants including Magnaporthe grisea and Fusarium oxysporum. The fungus also showed inhibitory effects on Staphylococcus aureus. In-vitro, species of Petriella can produce immunosuppressive metabolites but none of the members of this group are regularly implicated in human disease. Habitat and ecology Petriella setifera was originally found on horse feces in 1912, but has since been linked to decayed wood, compost and maize field soil. It is most commonly found in soil and feces, but also common in wood or plant debris when in Graphium state. The discovery of P. setifera on rock hyrax dung was the first case of the fungus in Kenya. It has not been linked to this species prior. There are multiple reports of P. setifera found in unique environments including a human nail and bathroom jar, but these may be due to cross-contamination. One study found P. setifera in wood litter of chicken houses with a history of fungal infestations. Growth of the fungus was independent of ventilation and amount of light. There may be an association with ammonia, as the fungus was found in chicken fertilized soil but not in mineral fertilized. There was also a case of the fungus found in black pepper and mustard seedling rot. Researchers believe the fungus diverged from the genus Ceratocystis. The habitat P. setifera thrives in is difficult to isolate due to the environments it has been found in. The fungus has been recorded in multiple regions across continents. Regions of Canada, coastal Asia, Northern and Central Europe have frequent reports of the fungus. Petriella setifera has also been associated with Sessile oak in North-western Poland causing oak decline, and in Ontario cedar swamp soil. Phomopsis and Rosellinia acquila grew with P. setifera when isolated from oak. Nothapodytes nimmoniana and Pinus roxburghii are also possible plant hosts of the fungus, found in the Western Himalayas. Salvia miltiorrhiza has also been associated with the fungus. Petriella setifera has an endophytic relationship with this species, and possibly other plants. Use CMCase produced by P. setifera has a potential use in denim stoning with the ability to cause fabric loss and indigo dye removal.

Early life and education Cliff was born November 29, 1891 in Banksville, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. He was one of ten children born to Thomas Ball and Charlotte Ann Burrows. Both of his parents and three of his siblings emigrated from England to the US in 1879. Cliff graduated from McKeesport High School in 1910. Cliff spent time working at his father's supply company delivering coal, operating a hoist, shoveling sand and gravel, and dispatching trucks making $90 a month. During this time his father was taking money out of his paycheck and setting it aside for Cliff. Cliff also worked as a clerk for a bank, and an insurance company. Cliff continued his education by taking evening courses at Duquesne University and business courses at Duffs Iron City College. Cliff joined the Aero Club of Pittsburgh when he was 18 years old, according to an early story. The club however, was founded in 1909 to promote an aerial demonstration, and was dormant until 1920 or so when it was restricted to WWI pilots and observers. It was not until a decade later that non-military pilots were accepted. =Air minded= His first air minded friend was Madame Alice Zeno. Madame Zeno was one of the early aeronauts to entertain crowds at fairs and other events at Calhoun Park (now Lincoln Place) in Pittsburgh between 1890 and 1909. She would hang from a trapeze suspended from a parachute attached to the bottom of a hot air balloon. Madame Zeno would ride the balloon to a height a few thousand feet above the crowd and then release the parachute from the balloon. Zeno would then ride the wind back to the earth. The first child to locate her landing spot would be rewarded with a quarter and Cliff was one of the children that often collected on that reward. Military service =World War 1= Cliff joined the Army National Guard July 16, 1917 in Pittsburgh. Cliff attempted to become a pilot when he enlisted but was rejected due to poor eyesight. He served during World War 1 with Troop H, 1st Cavalry Pennsylvania National Guard for a month before being transferred to the Headquarters Company of the 107th Field Artillery until he was released May 21, 1919. Cliff served overseas from April 30, 1918 until May 11, 1919 (Serial # 1249860). =World War II= During WWII Cliff served as a Captain and Chaplain in the Civil Air Patrol and managing director of district fields for Graham Aviation Flying School with its headquarters at Butler Field. On July 2, 1942 Cliff was commander of the 315th group at Butler Field where he organized three squadrons of civil pilots, 7 of the 68 fliers were woman. Many served as coastal patrol in spotting submarines, such as Jacob Schlager, who returned from Atlantic Patrol Duty at the end of June 1942. Career =Curious auto dealer= After the war Cliff returned to bookkeeping for a bond office for a while. He used the $5000 his father had saved for him and opened an automobile dealership called Diamond Motor Sales Company located in McKeesport. Cliff became an agency for the Hudson – Essex auto manufactures as well as dealing in used cars. During his time as an automobile dealer, Cliff had been fascinated by aerial demonstrations held in a field across the Monongahela River from McKeesport. The field was owned by local farmer Harry C Neel. A friend and neighbor of Neel, D Barr Peat, had made arrangements with Neel to use his property for aerial demonstrations. Peat had cleared a landing area for barnstormers to use for exhibitions and sightseeing on weekends and holidays in exchange for part of the profits they made. In July 1919 Cliff had an encounter with a pilot. The pilot was in a group of traveling barnstormers that were performing in a county-wide exhibition. The pilots name was Eddie Stinson (founder Stinson Aircraft Co). Cliff paid for a ride with Stinson. This $10 or $15 investment for a ride turned Cliff's focus back towards aviation. =Building an airport= Cliff and Peat became partners with a common goal. They had several meetings with local Congressman M Clyde Kelly to convince Kelly of the benefits in bringing aviation to the Pittsburgh area. Cliff and Peat would continue to lobby for aviation with local business men while Kelly took it to congress. In 1924 Cliff and Peat began to raise money to expand the airfield. Cliff mortgaged everything he owned and they borrowed the rest. They used the money to buy the property from Neal for $35,000 in August 1925. (Neal used this seed money to start Jefferson Memorial Cemetery nearby) Cliff was President and Peat was Vice-President of the new Pittsburgh- McKeesport air field PMA. PMA started out on 25 acres. They used the leftover money from the purchase of the property along with additional funding, from Sam Brendel, Neel and Cliff's brother Albert Ball, and they erected a building that was used as a combination machine shop, concession stand and living quarters for pilots. Peat cut down trees and ran a tractor filling in ditches adding an additional 18 acres of useful space to the airfield. Cliff would stage aerial stunts and plane rides as well as running the concession stand. In 1925 Cliff hired a secretary, Helen Marie Stinner (later his wife), who also acted as gatekeeper and ticket taker. =Entertaining the crowds= The traveling barnstormers charged $5 a plane ride and the PMA received $1 of that. In a week the airfield made about $250. In August officials of the local American Legion, Burt Foster post No. 361, signed a contract with PMA to hold an airplane meet. With the money from the Legion contract Cliff expanded the airfield from 43 to 85 acres. Cliff bought his own plane from the Robertson Aircraft Corporation of St Louis, whose pilot and instructor was named Charles A Lindbergh. The plane had been named \\"Fly Today\\" and was a Standard J-1 in rough shape. It was suggested by Lindbergh based on the money Cliff had to spend. Cliff hired a local stunt flyer named Romer Weyant to fly his airplane for the Sunday and Holiday events. In September PMA attempted to bring more interest to the new airport by hosting \\"The Battle in the Clouds\\" which was a reenactment of a French Balloon being shot down from 8,000 feet by hostile planes. Stunt flying and Army Air Planes were also on site for the crowd to enjoy. PMA held the Legion Aviation Meet on October 17/18, 1925. The Legion meet was termed the largest air meet ever held in the state of Pennsylvania. It was estimated that more than 10,000 people attended. Over 100 planes came from across the country, with military and commercial aces, to participate. The crowd was witness to races, stunts, wing walking, skywriting, and parachute jumps. The meet was held with the co-operation of the Aero Club of Pittsburgh and the Technical Data Section of the Army Air Service. =Expanding aviation= In January after the passing of what became known as the Kelly Airmail Act, Pittsburgh Postmaster George W Gosser recommended PMA as the best local field to use as a feeder line for receiving and shipping the US Mail. As president of PMA, Cliff went on a tour of the Airports along the transcontinental Airmail route to inspect aircraft, equipment and best practices to bring back for use at PMA. During this trip Cliff visited the Swallow Airplane Company in Wichita, Kansas to inspect a new fleet of Air Mail planes being produced. In preparation for bidding on one of the air mail routes Cliff founded the \\"Skyline Transport Company\\" (STC), better known as \\"Clifford Ball, Inc\\", and submitted a bid on March 25 for Contract Air Mail route 11 (CAM-11) to fly Airmail between Pittsburgh, PA and Cleveland, OH. Late in March the Postal Authorities notified Cliff they would visit PMA to inspect the facility prior to any contract being awarded. Cliff continued searching for ways to bring business into the Airport and in January he was able to convince the Swallow Airplane Co to build an assembly plant at the Airport. Immediately they began shipping airplane parts to be assembled at PMA. Some planes were assembled and Cliff acted as a local distributor and salesman for the new Swallow aircraft selling a few planes while waiting for the new plant to be built. However the plant never materialized. On March 27, 1926 STC won the bid for CAM 11 and was awarded the Government Contract starting on May 1. Cliff was the only bidder on the route and planned to begin operations on July 1 with three Swallow Aircraft. Cliff had flown over 100 hours but the contract from his bondman for STC stated he could not fly for five years. PMA \\"informally\\" opened to the public on June 19, 1926 with a free exhibition of acrobatic flying by the air mail pilots. The airmail service official opening was delayed by a Government requirement for heavier planes. PMA \\"officially\\" opened to the public on July 20, 1926 by holding an Air Circus with 10 stunt fliers to entertain the crowds with acrobatic maneuvers, altitude flights and races. Cliff announced that this will be the Headquarters of the Pittsburgh-Cleveland Air Mail service slated to start in about 2 months after acquiring appropriate planes. On May 31, 1928 PMA hosted the National Elimination Balloon Races with more than 150,000 people in attendance. The added seats for the event were widely used on future weekends and holidays for people to sit and watch the airport activities. It was around this time that the first requirements of the physical exam for a pilot license, even for students, were created. Pilots across the state begin bringing their damaged planes to Bettis for repairs due to the growing reputation of PMA. =Renaming the field= Less than four months after the official opening of PMA the name was changed. On November 26, 1926 approximately 75 Airplanes were used in the formal dedication of Bettis Aviation Field, named for Lieutenant Cyrus K. Bettis, a well known aviator that was killed in a crash near Bellefonte, PA. After a dedication speech was made former squadron mates of Bettis took to the sky in there Curtiss P-1 Hawk pursuit planes to make their dedication to him above the crowd. Some of the aircraft on display at the event were the Douglas C-1, a huge twin-motored Martin NBS-1 Bomber, and a Fokker Special monoplane. In attendance were Ithrene Bettis, sister of the fallen aviator; Myrtle Peacock, his fiancée; Congressman M Clyde Kelly; William P MacCracken, Jr, assistant secretary of commerce and director of commercial aviation; George W Gosser, Pittsburgh postmaster; George H Lysle, mayor of McKeesport; Colonel H C Fry, chairman of the aviation board of the Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce; and Captain Thomas S Voss, in charge of Rodgers Airfield northeast of downtown Pittsburgh. =Airmail contract= Cliff ordered four new OX-5 powered Waco 9 type biplanes to meet the new government requirements and by the morning of April 19 two were at the field. Cliff sent his Chief Pilot and head of the Operating Division, Merle A \\"Moup\\" Moltrup, on a test run. Flying the new Waco 9, \\"Miss Pittsburgh\\", from Bettis to Youngstown and then on to Cleveland and back while Cliff and the postmaster timed the run in preparation for the opening. Two of the new Waco 9's had arrive and a third was expected. Airmail route inauguration The new Pittsburgh-Cleveland, via Youngstown, Air Mail route was inaugurated on April 21, 1927. \\"Miss Youngstown\\" ”Miss Pittsburgh\\" and \\"Miss McKeesport\\" flew out of Bettis on the 20th to partake in celebrations at Cleveland and Youngstown. The three planes were then loaded for the first mail to return to Bettis. Some of those on hand were the Director of Bettis Field, Clifford Ball; Superintendent of the field, D Barr Peat; Superintendent of Air Mail contracts of Washington, Earl B Wadsworth; Local postmaster, George W Gosser; Superintendent of Mail, L E Palmer, a veteran of the mail service for 55 years; Assistant Postmaster, James B Anderson; Superintendent of motor vehicles, David B Wilson; Assistant Secretary of Commerce in charge of Aeronautics, William P MacCracken, Jr and Congressman Clyde Kelly, father of the airmail bill. Undaunted by rain a crowd of 5000 to 7000 cheered the arrival of two little speaks emerging from the storm clouds, drowning out the brass band. \\"Miss Youngstown\\" piloted by \\"Moup\\" with Arthur J Lynch, traffic manager, as a passenger were first to land with the first airmail for Pittsburgh. \\"Miss Pittsburgh\\" piloted by Dewey L Noyes landed soon after. Miss Carrie Dickson officially christened \\"Miss Pittsburgh\\" while Miss Louise Helmstead officially christened \\"Miss McKeesport\\" once the delayed plane arrived piloted by Kenneth F \\"Curly\\" Lovejoy. Miss Youngstown followed by Miss Pittsburgh were re-loaded and took off for their outbound trips. Planes from the US Army Reserve field at Aspinwall escorted them to Youngstown. The escort including Capt Thomas S Voss, commandant of Rodgers field; Col Harry C Fry Jr, chairman of the aviation committee of Pittsburgh chamber of commerce; Capt John Dake, Frank J Ambrose, John A Broderick, J J Feery and E W Thompson. On April 4, 1929 pilot Dewyey Noyes made the first night flight on the airmail route. =Tragedy for Ball Airmail Service= On June 25, 1927 pilot Clyde Emerick crashed at Bettis. Emerick worked for Johnson Airplane and Supply Co. at Al Johnson's Wilmington Pike airfield in the downtown Dayton, Ohio area. The plane was taking off and one of the two engines of the Johnson – 60 type failed about 100 feet off the ground. The plane crashed to the ground throwing the pilot into the spinning propeller. He was rushed to McKeesport Hospital in an ambulance suffering a compound fracture of the skull. The plane had stopped at Bettis for the night and was resuming the following morning when the crash occurred. The plane had minor damage with wrecked landing gear. Clyde Emerick succumbs to his injuries and died July 6 at McKeesport hospital, his wife by his side. His passenger G F Gerber, of Johnstown, PA crawled from the wrecked plane unhurt. =A surprise visitor= Colonel Lindbergh made a landing for fuel on June 29, 1927. A pair of Curtis pursuit planes landing at the airport was not news. The first plane pulled within a few feet of the hangar after landing. Its pilot was not recognized until he removed his goggles and smiled. Lindbergh had a deep interest in Bettis Field and asked many questions and gave congratulations on the mail contract. Word got out and the field was soon crowded with admirers. However, most had missed him. It only took 35 minutes for the two planes to be topped with fuel and Lindbergh and his companion Major Landphiers (Cmdr of 1sr pursuit Sq) finished some barbecue sandwiches before they took off for St. Louis. =Lindbergh Goodwill Tour= The popularity of aviation was growing fast and on August 23, 1927 Bettis field got another boost when Charles Lindbergh landed at the field in his Ryan monoplane during his 22,000-mile, 82 city tour Goodwill Tour. The airfield was packed to overflowing with people waiting for the arrival of Lindbergh. People lined the roads from Bettis field to downtown Pittsburgh to get a look at the new hero as his motorcade headed to the reception area. Lindbergh required that his airplane be hangared. Because of its wingspan, it had to be slid in sideways on greased rails. Lindbergh left the next day to the cheers of more than 30,000 people. =Pittsburgh School of Aviation= With the Airmail contract secured, in June Cliff added a flying school at the field called \\"Pittsburgh School of Aviation\\", formerly known as Bob Trader's Flying School. The school had both a ground and flying course. Cliff organizing the school patterned after the flying clubs of England and the United States. Students were trained in the Waco aircraft, as Bettis was a distribution center for the manufacture, Advance Aircraft Co of Troy, Ohio. The students were called the \\"Bettis Field Cadets\\" and by April it was co-ed. Catherine and Louise Reiff, Collett Rohaus, Olive Herskovitz, Helen Richey, Mrs Ida Snyder Wilson, and Mrs Edna Wolf were some of the early female student fliers. A local newspaper ad read: =Passenger service= Along with the Aviation School Cliff added a Passenger Service. Expanding from the two seat Bi-Planes, Cliff first purchased a Ryan Brougham (#5552). When the route was lengthened Cliff added a Pitcairn Mailwing with a J-5 engine and a J-5 powered Travel Air, the first plane equipped with landing lights, navigation lights and flares. Cliff continued to expand service by making connections with other airlines, such as Stout Airlines, to extend service to the public. In June Cliff ordered three Fairchild FC-2 Cabin Monoplane with the first being delivered on the 9th. In August 1929 the passenger service was then extended to Washington, D C landing just across the Potomac River at Hoover Field. By January 1929 Cliff, now the sole owner of the CAM 11 contract, had run successfully for two years. At that time the government exercised its option to extend the contract for the full eight years. With the guarantee of another six years of airmail service Cliff built a new hangar to hold 22 aircraft with a second to be built the following month. At this time Cliff had six planes in the airmail service to Cleveland. Cliff expanded his growing list of aircraft with a Ford tri-motor, another Fairchild FC-2, five New Standard D-27, and seven Waco 9's as payment for a storage charge. On April 28, 1929 the first passengers, 4 men in a Fairchild FC-2 from Pittsburgh to Cleveland, opened the newly named \\"Path of the Eagle\\" passenger service. This date is used by the National Safety Council to mark the commencement of the unmatched safety record that Cliff, and succeeding companies have made over this route. In August Cliff had pilot Frank Dayton take him to Harrisburg for a demand certificate to operate a taxi service there. Along for his firsts plane ride was Pittsburgh Postmaster George W Gosser. During the first week of October Clifford Ball Inc expanding its \\"Path of the Eagle\\" offerings from Detroit to Washington DC connecting with Stout Air Lines at Cleveland. Ball Airline merger After the passing of the Air Mail Act of 1930 many small Airlines were forced to merge in order to meet the new government requirements. Cliff merged his Cleveland-Pittsburgh- Washington passenger line with the new Pennsylvania Air Lines (PAL). Officers of the new \\"Path of the Eagle\\" were Cliff Ball as President and general manager; R Park Marshall as Vice-President and Director; Arthur Ball as Secretary and Treasurer; and W C Smith as Director. The merger would keep Pittsburgh on the feeder line connecting the transcontinental route. Synchronizing the \\"Path of the Eagle\\" allowed travel from Oakland, CA to NY using connections with Boeing Lines, Pittsburgh Airways, Stout Air Lines, and Western Air Express. With the merger came new services and rates encompassing all Cliff's business. Cliff added passenger service to Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis and St. Paul. Service between New Castle, Chicago, and Washington was added. The Akron, Youngstown, and New Castle line was inaugurated by the Tri- motored Ford piloted by R L Baker. And the use of the new Adams airmail pick- up device in cities between Pittsburgh and Cleveland was started for the smaller towns without airfield. Another first for Pittsburgh was the new service of Week-end air trip excursions to Cleveland and Washington and Sunday Service. Because of improved patronage and equipment Cliff reduced rates four times within one year. =Ball Aviation Company transferred= Clifford Ball Aviation Company was purchased by Pittsburgh Aviation Industries Corporation (PAIC), a holding company, November 4, 1930 after the president of PAIC, George R Hann, and Ball came to an agreement. No changes or additions to the service were made and the new organization would continue to operate under the name Pennsylvania Air Line, Inc (PAL). Ball was retained as Vice-President in charge of Operations and general manager. PIAC executive secretary Richard W Robbins was made President. PAIC had established the Pittsburgh-Butler airport, the Penn School of Aviation and the Pittsburgh Aerial Surveys company and had recently affiliated with Transcontinental and Western Inc to establish a coast-to-coast all air passengers' service via Pittsburgh. Resigns post Cliff transferred all of his PAL stock to PAIC and resigned from PAL on October 2, 1933 without any explanation. Cliff had been vice-president in charge of operations since selling his \\"Path of the Eagle\\" passenger and airmail line to PAIC. Cliff gave no reason for his withdrawal from PAL only stated he was going on an indefinite leave of absence, going to the World Series and then heading to Florida for a rest. Testifies to Congress Ball testified before the Congress at the Air Mail Cancellation Hearings that Richard W Robbins and George R Hann, of Sewickley Heights, in colluding with Postmaster Brown schemed to defame him in order to award his contract to their PAIC, which took over Ball's Pennsylvania Air Lines. PAIC was supposedly allied with the Mellon interests. Cliff was charged before the Senate airmail committee that former Postmaster-General Walter F Brown and officials of the PIAC, participated in \\"a well planned scheme to defame\\" his character in 1930. Cliff testified that Brown fined him $5,000 for carrying \\"unlawful\\" mail. This accusation was made to Ball directly and among friends and acquaintances by George R Hann and Richard W Robbins of PAIC. The scheme was to defame Ball in order to carry out their plan of transferring the mail contract to PAIC even though PAIC did not operate an airline at the time, which was a requirement. According to Cliff and other witness testimony during the meetings on Airmail Hann stated, Late career =Radio manufacturing= In 1938 Cliff is listed as Vice-President of Hotel Radio & Equipment Company and Voco Radio Manufacturing Company. He remained active with the Radio Equipment business until 1947 based on Pittsburgh directories of the time. Voco was located in the old Point Building at the intersection of Penn and Water, currently Point State Park. Albert M Greenfield & Co leased space on the fourth floor of the Point Building for the Point Land Company to the Voco Radio Manufacturing Company, Inc., for the manufacture, sale and servicing of radios and radio equipment. =Return to the air= Cliff spent some time working for Taylorcraft Aircraft of Conway, PA and was a member of the airport advisory Committee before being brought in as the first superintendent of the Greater Pittsburgh Airport (GPA), which opened April 23, 1952. Cliff was chosen as Vice-President in charge of operations of the GPA beginning May 15. The airport was touted as the second largest in the nation at the time. Cliff was in direct charge of pilots and planes. His office was equipped with all the latest meteorological instruments so that he had the news on the weather from 42 different stations. He held this position until October, 1955 when he went to the Allegheny County Airport as manager/director until 1958. OX-5 Club Cliff started the OX-5 Club after Charlie Carroll, the operator of the Latrobe, PA airport, came to the Aero Club of Pittsburgh in June of 55' with the idea of arranging a rally for OX-5 pilots. At the first meeting officers were selected and Cliff was made National Secretary. To Cliff's surprise 107 pilots registered for the first gathering of the new club. By the end of '56 that numbers had reached 990 and in '57 it was 4,249. By 1980 membership of the OX-5 club had grown to more than 12,000 members. Death Cliff died of heart failure at his office in the OX-5 club and Aero Club headquarters in downtown Pittsburgh June 2, 1972. According to Flora Balmer, the secretary for decades, Cliff simply collapsed at his desk.

Minnesota was won by the Democratic Party candidate, incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson, who had assumed the presidency less than a year earlier following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, won the state over U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona by a margin of 431,493 votes, or 27.76%. Johnson went on to win the election nationally, by a landslide margin of 22.58% of the popular vote. Goldwater carried only six states, including his home state of Arizona, together with the five southern states of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. In the 1964 election, President Johnson carried Minnesota — which tended to favor Republicans prior to the 1974 Watergate Scandal — by a margin of victory that hadn't been seen in a presidential election in the state since Franklin D. Roosevelt carried the state by a margin of 30.83% over Alf Landon in 1936. This margin of victory was aided by the fact that Hubert Humphrey, the state's incumbent US Senator, was on the Democratic ticket for vice president. Nationally, no candidate since James Monroe’s re-election in 1820 had won as great a percentage of the popular vote as did Johnson in 1964, nor has any candidate since 1964. , this is the last election in which Brown County, Redwood County, and Rock County voted for a Democratic presidential candidate.Sullivan, Robert David; ‘How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century’; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Results { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font- size: 95%;\\" - style=\\"background-color:#E9E9E9\\" ! colspan=\\"6\\"  1964 United States presidential election in Minnesota -bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\" align=\\"center\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width: 15em\\" Party ! style=\\"width: 17em\\" Candidate ! style=\\"width: 5em\\" Votes ! style=\\"width: 7em\\" Percentage ! style=\\"width: 5em\\" Electoral votes - ! style=\\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\\"   style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Democratic  Lyndon B.

Battle According to the Taliban, a four pronged attack was launched on Kunduz on the morning of 3 October 2016. They later claimed to have seized several checkpoints and the city's roundabout. Afghanistan special forces were flown in from Kabul to assist in securing the city. By the evening the local police chief, Kassim Jangal Bagh, told the press that the city center was in government hands, a statement later backed by the NATO–led Resolute Support Mission. He also said that a full counteroffensive had been launched to clear the area. It was reported that fighting persisted near the governor's compound, the local police headquarters, and the local National Directorate of Security headquarters. The Ministry of the Interior stated that at least one police officer was killed and four more were wounded. A member of parliament who represented the area say that Taliban had overrun parts of the city and taken control of the city center. On 4 October, Afghan forces managed to regain control of the city center. Casualties According to the Kunduz provincial health director, at least 151 were wounded and one was killed.

The city was founded as its capitol, beside the town of Franklinton, since incorporated into Columbus. The city's early history was gradual, as residents dealt with flooding and cholera epidemics, and the city had few direct connections to other cities. This led creation of a feeder canal, and later, freight and passenger railroads. The city became known for its industry and commercial businesses into the 20th century, though it experienced a lull in development in the late 20th century. In the 21st century, Columbus has been increasingly revitalized, led by parks projects, new developments, and efforts to beautify individual neighborhoods. Ancient and early history Shrum Mound, the feature of Campbell Memorial Park Between 1000 B.C. and 1700 A.D., the Columbus metropolitan area was a center to indigenous cultures known as the Moundbuilders. The cultures included the Adena, Hopewell and Fort Ancient people. The only remaining physical evidence of the cultures are their burial mounds and what they contained. Most of Central Ohio's remaining mounds are located outside of Columbus city boundaries, though the Shrum Mound is upkept, now part of a public park and historic site. The city's Mound Street derives its name from a mound that existed by the intersection of Mound and High Streets. The mound's clay was used in bricks for most of the cit'y initial brick buildings; many were subsequently used in the Ohio Statehouse. The city's Ohio History Center maintains a collection of artifacts from these cultures. 18th century: Ohio Country Map of the Ohio Country between 1775–1794, depicting locations of battles and massacres surrounding the area that would eventually become Ohio The area including modern-day Columbus once comprised the Ohio Country,\\"The testing grounds of modern empire: the making of colonial racial order in the American Ohio country and the South African Eastern Cape, 1770s–1850s\\" , Christoph Strobel. Peter Lang, 2008. , . p. 22 under the nominal control of the French colonial empire through the Viceroyalty of New France from 1663 until 1763. In the 18th century, European traders flocked to the area, attracted by the fur trade.\\"Chapter One: The Anglo-French Contest for the Ohio Country\\" , Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. Retrieved September 10, 2010. The area was often caught between warring factions, including American Indian and European interests. In the 1740s, Pennsylvania traders overran the territory until the French forcibly evicted them. In the early 1750s, the Ohio Company sent George Washington to the Ohio Country to survey. Fighting for control of the territory in the French and Indian War (1754-1763) became part of the international Seven Years' War (1756-1763). During this period, the region routinely suffered turmoil, massacres, and battles. The 1763 Treaty of Paris ceded the Ohio Country to the British Empire. =Virginia Military District= After the American Revolution, the Virginia Military District became part of Ohio Country as a territory of Virginia. Colonists from the East Coast moved in, but rather than finding an empty frontier, they encountered people of the Miami, Delaware, Wyandot, Shawnee, and Mingo nations, as well as European traders. The tribes resisted expansion by the fledgling United States, leading to years of bitter conflict. The decisive Battle of Fallen Timbers resulted in the Treaty of Greenville, which finally opened the way for new settlements. By 1797, a young surveyor from Virginia named Lucas Sullivant had founded a permanent settlement on the west bank of the forks of the Scioto River and Olentangy River. An admirer of Benjamin Franklin, Sullivant chose to name his frontier village \\"Franklinton\\".Lentz, p. 33 The location was desirable for its proximity to navigable rivers—but Sullivant was initially foiled when, in 1798, a large flood wiped out the new settlement.Moore, p. 101 He persevered, and the village was rebuilt. After the Revolution land comprising parts of Franklin and adjacent counties was set aside by the United States Congress for settlement by Canadians and Nova Scotians who were sympathetic to the colonial cause and had their land and possessions seized by the British government. The Refugee Tract, consisting of , was long and wide, was claimed by 67 eligible men. The Statehouse sits on land once contained in the Refugee Tract. 19th century: statehood, city establishment, and development After Ohio achieved statehood in 1803, political infighting among prominent Ohio leaders led to the state capital moving from Chillicothe to Zanesville and back again. Desiring to settle on a location, the state legislature considered Franklinton, Dublin, Worthington, and Delaware before compromising on a plan to build a new city in the state's center, near major transportation routes, primarily rivers. As well, Franklinton landowners had donated two plots in an effort to convince the state to move its capitol there. The two spaces were set to become Capitol Square (for the Ohio Statehouse) and the Ohio Penitentiary. Named in honor of Christopher Columbus, the city was founded on February 14, 1812, on the \\"High Banks opposite Franklinton at the Forks of the Scioto most known as Wolf's Ridge.\\"Lentz, pp. 41–43 At the time, this area was a dense forestland, used only as a hunting ground.Moore, p. 122 The city was incorporated as a borough on February 10, 1816. Nine people were elected to fill the municipality's various positions of mayor, treasurer, and several others. In 1816-1817, Jarvis W. Pike would serve as the first mayor. Although the recent War of 1812 had brought prosperity to the area, the subsequent recession and conflicting claims to the land threatened the new town's success. Early conditions were abysmal with frequent bouts of fevers, attributed to malaria from the flooding rivers, and an outbreak of cholera in 1833. It led Columbus to appoint the Board of Health, now part of the Columbus Public Health department. The outbreak, which remained in the city from July to September 1833, killed 100 people. Columbus was without direct river or trail connections to other Ohio cities, leading to slow initial growth. The National Road reached Columbus from Baltimore in 1831, which complemented the city's new link to the Ohio and Erie Canal, both of which facilitated a population boom.Lentz, p. 58 A wave of European immigrants led to the creation of two ethnic enclaves on the city's outskirts. A large Irish population settled in the north along Naghten Street (presently Nationwide Boulevard), while the Germans took advantage of the cheap land to the south, creating a community that came to be known as the Das Alte Südende (The Old South End). Columbus's German population constructed numerous breweries, Trinity Lutheran Seminary, and Capital University.Lentz, pp. 63–64 With a population of 3,500, Columbus was officially chartered as a city on March 3, 1834. On that day the legislature carried out a special act, which granted legislative authority to the city council and judicial authority to the mayor. Elections were held in April of that year, with voters choosing one John Brooks as the first mayor.Moore, p. 156 Columbus annexed the then- separate city of Franklinton in 1837. Central Market stood on Fourth Street from 1850 to 1966 View of the city from Capital University in 1854 In 1850, the Columbus and Xenia Railroad became the first railroad into the city, followed by the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad in 1851. The two railroads built a joint Union Station on the east side of High Street just north of Naghten (then called North Public Lane). Rail traffic into Columbus increased—by 1875, eight railroads served Columbus, and the rail companies built a new, more elaborate station. Another cholera outbreak hit Columbus in 1849, prompting the opening of the city's Green Lawn Cemetery. On January 7, 1857, the Ohio Statehouse finally opened after 18 years of construction.Lentz, pp. 70–71 Site construction continued until 1861. Before the abolition of slavery in the South in 1863, the Underground Railroad was active in Columbus; led, in part, by James Preston Poindexter. Poindexter arrived in Columbus in the 1830s and became a Baptist Preacher and leader in the city's African- American community until the turn of the century.A Notable Colored Man has just Passed Away, Xenia Daily Gazette (Xenia, Ohio) February 8, 1907, page 7, accessed October 5, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6906223// During the Civil War, Columbus was a major base for the volunteer Union Army. It housed 26,000 troops and held up to 9,000 Confederate prisoners of war at Camp Chase, at what is now the Hilltop neighborhood of west Columbus. Over 2,000 Confederate soldiers remain buried at the site, making it one of the North's largest Confederate cemeteries.Lentz, p. 78 North of Columbus, along the Delaware Road, the Regular Army established Camp Thomas, where the 18th U.S. Infantry organized and trained. By virtue of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College (which became Ohio State University) founded in 1870 on the former estate of William and Hannah Neil.Lentz, p.57 Bird's eye view map of Columbus in 1872 By the end of the 19th century, Columbus was home to several major manufacturing businesses. The city became known as the \\"Buggy Capital of the World,\\" thanks to the two dozen buggy factories—notably the Columbus Buggy Company, founded in 1875 by C.D. Firestone. The Columbus Consolidated Brewing Company also rose to prominence during this time and might have achieved even greater success were it not for the Anti-Saloon League in neighboring Westerville.Lentz, pp. 85–87 In the steel industry, a forward-thinking man named Samuel P. Bush presided over the Buckeye Steel Castings Company. Columbus was also a popular location for labor organizations. In 1886, Samuel Gompers founded the American Federation of Labor in Druid's Hall on S. Fourth Street, and in 1890 the United Mine Workers of America was founded at old City Hall.Lentz, pp. 91–92 In 1894, James Thurber, who would go on to an illustrious literary career in Paris and New York City, was born in the city. Today Ohio State's theater department has a performance center named in his honor, and his youthful home near the Discovery District is on the National Register of Historic Places. 20th century The city c. 1924 Columbus in 1936 The Columbus Experiment was an environmental project in 1908 which involved construction of the first water plant in the world to apply filtration and softening, designed and invented by two brothers, Clarence and Charles Hoover. Those working to construct the project included Jeremiah O'Shaughnessy, name-bearer of the Columbus metropolitan area's O'Shaughnessy Dam. This invention helped drastically reduce typhoid deaths. The essential design is still used today.\\"General Water Treatment Process\\", Department of Public Utilities, City of Columbus (2007). Retrieved July 3, 2012 Columbus earned one of its nicknames, The Arch City, because of the dozens of wooden arches that spanned High Street at the turn of the 20th century. The arches illuminated the thoroughfare and eventually became the means by which electric power was provided to the new streetcars. The city tore down the arches and replaced them with cluster lights in 1914 but reconstructed them from metal in the Short North district in 2002 for their unique historical interest.Lentz, pp. 94–95 On March 25, 1913, the Great Flood of 1913 in Columbus devastated the neighborhood of Franklinton, leaving over ninety people dead and thousands of West Side residents homeless. To prevent flooding, the Army Corps of Engineers recommended widening the Scioto River through downtown, constructing new bridges, and building a retaining wall along its banks. With the strength of the post-World War I economy, a construction boom occurred in the 1920s, resulting in a new Civic center, the Ohio Theatre, the American Insurance Union Citadel, and, to the north, a massive new Ohio Stadium.Lentz, pp. 112–113 Although the American Professional Football Association was founded in Canton in 1920, its head offices moved to Columbus in 1921 to the New Hayden Building and remained in the city until 1941. In 1922, the association's name was changed to the National Football League. A decade later, in 1931, at a convention in the city, the Jehovah's Witnesses took that name by which they are known today. The effects of the Great Depression were less severe in Columbus, as the city's diversified economy helped it fare better than its Rust Belt neighbors. World War II brought many new jobs and another population surge. This time, most new arrivals were migrants from the \\"extraordinarily depressed rural areas\\" of Appalachia, who would soon account for more than a third of Columbus's growing population.Lentz, pp.116–118 In 1948, the Town and Country Shopping Center opened in suburban Whitehall, and it is now regarded as one of the first modern shopping centers in the United States.Lentz, p. 122 The construction of the Interstate Highway System signaled the arrival of rapid suburb development in central Ohio. To protect the city's tax base from this suburbanization, Columbus adopted a policy of linking sewer and water hookups to annexation to the city.Lentz, p. 129 In December 1977, Warner Cable transformed cable TV service in thousands of Columbus households with QUBE, which utilized a remote control device that was intended to change television into an interactive experience with audiences. The service launched amidst considerable national and international press coverage.Talking Back to Television, The Washington Post, September 3, 1978. By the early 1990s, Columbus had grown to become Ohio's largest city in land area and in population. Efforts to revitalize downtown Columbus have had some success in recent decades, though like most major American cities, some architectural heritage was lost in the process. In the 1970s, landmarks such as Union Station and the Neil House hotel were razed to construct high-rise offices and big retail space. The PNC Bank building was constructed in 1977, as well as the Nationwide Plaza buildings and other towers that sprouted during this period. The construction of the Greater Columbus Convention Center has brought major conventions and trade shows to the city. AmeriFlora '92 was held in the city in 1992, part of the Christopher Columbus Quincentennial Jubilee, celebrating the 500th anniversary of Columbus's first voyage. Its organizers spent $95 million on it. The organizers also planned to create a replica Native American village, among other attractions. Local and national native leaders protested the event with a day of mourning, followed by protests and fasts at City Hall. The protests prevented the native village from being exhibited. Annual fasts continued until 1997. A protest also took place during the dedication of the Santa Maria replica, an event held in late 1991 on the day before Columbus Day and in time for the jubilee.https://indiancountrytoday.com/news/those-statues-didn-t- topple-overnight- zABD-2ZRvkCMStnd60DASghttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning- mix/wp/2018/10/08/columbus-ohio-once-spent-95-million-to-celebrate-columbus- day-now-its-canceled/ 21st century Street arches returned to the Short North in late 2002. In 1999, just before the turn of the 21st century, the city's first African American mayor was elected. Michael Coleman, a Democrat, served 16 years, the longest of any mayor of the city.https://www.dispatch.com/article/20151111/NEWS/311119721 Coleman's administration led to Nationwide Insurance redeveloping the former Ohio Penitentiary site and nearby blocks into the Arena District. Similar new construction and redevelopment was taking place in the Brewery District, and a flood wall was completed in Franklinton in 2004, finally letting development resume in the neighborhood. The Scioto Mile began development along the riverfront, an area that already had the Miranova Corporate Center and The Condominiums at North Bank Park. The 2010 United States foreclosure crisis forced the city to purchase numerous foreclosed, vacant properties to renovate or demolish themat a cost of tens of millions of dollars. In February 2011, Columbus had 6,117 vacant properties, according to city officials. Since 2010, Columbus has been growing and improving. From 2010 to 2017, the city added 164,000 jobs, second in the United States. The city is focused on downtown revitalization, with recent projects being the Columbus Commons park, parks along the Scioto Mile developed along with a reshaped riverfront, and developments in the Arena District and Franklinton. Around 2018, Columbus became one of 20 cities as finalists in Amazon's search for a new headquarters, dubbed Amazon HQ2. The city planned tax incentives of about $500,000, and looked to the company moving into the Franklinton, Easton, or Ohio State University areas.https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/columbus- releases-some-details-of-their-pitch-to-get-amazon-hq2 In 2020, 5G service began in the city, with Verizon and AT&T; installing cell towers throughout the city. The pole installation was controversial in historic districts, where residents and the city only had say over wood versus metal poles, and not in their prominent placement in historic neighborhoods. In February and March 2020, the city began to have its first cases of Coronavirus disease 2019, the disease which created the COVID-19 pandemic. The city is in a state of emergency, with all nonessential businesses closed state-wide. There are 3,432 cases of the disease across the city, .https://www.columbus.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2147515356 In May, as COVID-19 persisted in the city, businesses began to reopen.

With the end of the ice age to the north, sea levels rose so that coastal Florida became inundated and Florida's land mass shrank while the southeastern United States became wetter than it had been. Paleo-Indians then required fewer moves between water spots and more populous camps inhabited for longer periods of time emerged. Among the spots where camps from this later period have been found is around Paynes Prairie, very close to Gainesville.Milanich, The Timucua:5Milanich, Florida Indians and the Invasion from Europe:20 Eventually more complex social organization and agricultural practices emerged into what archaeologists classify as the Deptford culture (2500–100 BC).

The Native Americans, having little resistance to diseases introduced from Europe, declined significantly in number after the arrival of Europeans, and Spanish suppression of native revolts further reduced the population.

County residents decided to move the county seat from Newnansville (and chose the name Gainesville) in 1853, as the proposed railroad would bypass Newnansville. A site on Black Oak Ridge where the railroad was expected to cross it was selected in 1854. It is generally accepted that the new settlement was named for General Edmund P. Gaines, commander of U.S. Army troops in Florida early in the Second Seminole War. The railroad was completed from Fernandina to Gainesville in 1859, passing six blocks south of the courthouse.Hildreth and Cox:2-6, 8Rajtar:21-5 It is claimed that Gainesville was originally named Hogtown; however, Hogtown was actually an early 19th-century settlement in and around what is now Westside Park (in the northeast corner of the intersection of NW 8th Avenue and 34th Street) where a historical marker \\"Historical Markers in Alachua County, Florida − HOGTOWN SETTLEMENT / FORT HOGTOWN\\", Retrieved 2011-06-27 \\"Historic Markers Across Florida − Hogtown settlement / Fort Hogtown\\", Retrieved 2011-06-27 notes Hogtown's location at that site. Hogtown is the eponymous village of the adjacent Hogtown Creek, which flows through Gainesville. \\"For the Implementation of Total Maximum Daily Loads Adopted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection In The Orange Creek Basin\\", Retrieved 2011-06-30 Hogtown continued to exist until after Gainesville was founded, as evidenced on a map showing both towns, which was published in 1864 based on surveys from 1855. Two residents of Hogtown played a prominent role in establishing Gainesville. William Lewis, who owned a plantation in Hogtown, delivered 20 votes pledged to him to create a new town on the expected route of the railroad, in an attempt to have the new town named Lewisville. Tillman Ingram, who also owned a plantation and a sawmill in Hogtown, helped swing the vote to move the county seat to the new town by offering to build a new courthouse at a low price. Residents of Newnansville, disgruntled at losing the county seat, called the site chosen for the new town \\"Hog Wallow\\", because of its location between Hogtown and Paynes Prairie. The former site of Hogtown was annexed by the City of Gainesville in 1961.Hildreth and Cox:2-3Rajtar:15-16, 59, 133 A town site of was purchased for $642.51. The County Commission ordered the public sale of lots in the town site in 1854, but no deeds were recorded until 1856. A courthouse was constructed in Gainesville in 1856, and the county seat was then officially moved from Newnansville. A jail was built in 1857, and a well was dug and a pump for public use installed the same year. Property values rose quickly. A city block on the edge of town purchased for $14.57 in 1857 sold for $100 in 1858. The railroad from Fernandina reached Gainesville in 1859, and connected to Cedar Key the next year. By that time, there were eight or nine stores and three hotels surrounding the courthouse square.Hildreth and Cox:6-9, 11-12 Secession and the Civil War In the 1850s secessionist sentiment was strong in Gainesville. Half of the white residents in Gainesville had been born in South Carolina (where secessionist sentiments were very strong), or had parents who had been born in that state. Aside from a few foreign-born residents, the other whites in town had also been born in Florida or other Southern states. Another factor was fear of blacks. Blacks, mostly slaves, were a majority of the population in Alachua County (although there were few in Gainesville itself). John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859 frightened the whites in Gainesville, leading them to organize a militia company called the Gainesville Minutemen.Hildreth and Cox:21-23 The Gainesville Minute Men were incorporated into the First Florida Regiment soon after Florida seceded from the Union. Several more companies were recruited in Gainesville and Alachua County during the Civil War. During the war Gainesville served as a depot for food requisitioned by the Confederate government from the surrounding area. A small post on the east side of Gainesville called Fort Lee was an induction point for men entering the Confederate States Army.Hildreth and Cox:24-26, 30-31 Fighting on a small scale reached Gainesville twice. On February 15, 1864, a small Union raiding party occupied Gainesville. Elements of the Second Florida Cavalry attempted to drive the Union force from the town but were defeated in a street battle. The raiding party was associated with a larger Union invasion of Florida that was defeated at the Battle of Olustee five days later. The Union troops did not seize or destroy any property on this raid, but did distribute food stores to the residents, who were suffering from shortages.Hildreth and Cox:33-35 Six months later, early in the morning of August 17, 1864, 265 Union troops and 15 \\"loyal Floridians\\" reached Gainesville. The troops stopped just east of town to prepare breakfast and care for their horses. A small home guard of 30 to 40 old men and boys attacked the Union camp, and were easily driven off. The Union troops then broke ranks and started looting the town. While the Union troops were scattered throughout the town a large number of Confederate troops were spotted approaching. The Union troops resisted the Confederate advance for an hour and a half, but were finally driven from Gainesville with heavy casualties.Hildreth and Cox:35-36 After the Civil War For several months following the Civil War, the 3rd United States Colored Troops were stationed in Gainesville, which encouraged freed men to settle there. At the same time black farm laborers were recruited from Georgia and South Carolina to help harvest what was expected to be a very large cotton crop, but heavy rain ruined the cotton, and the recently arrived blacks were left without work. Black residents soon outnumbered whites in Gainesville, which had had 223 white residents in 1860. Vagrancy and theft became major problems in Gainesville, and large numbers of blacks were arrested by federal troops.Braley:4Rajtar:29, 31-6 White residents resumed political life in Florida immediately after the end of the Civil War. Gainesville incorporated as a city in 1866, but the city government was weak and the council did not maintain a regular schedule of meetings. With military control asserted over Florida in 1867 as part of Reconstruction, the reconstituted Florida legislature required all cities to re-incorporate, and Gainesville did so in 1869.Hildreth and Cox:40-42 During Reconstruction Gainesville blacks were elected to a number of state and local offices. Blacks had largely been disenfranchised by the 1890s, however.Pickard:27 Downtown Gainesville on Alachua Avenue (now University Avenue) circa 1882 Following the Civil War, the city prospered as an important cotton shipping facility. Florida produced more Sea Island Cotton in the 1880s than any other state, and Gainesville was the leading shipping point for cotton in Florida. Two more railroads had reached Gainesville by the 1880s, and citrus and vegetables had become important local crops.Pickard:1-2 However, the citrus industry ended when the great freezes of 1894−95 and 1899 destroyed the crops, and citrus growing was largely abandoned in the area. Phosphate mining and lumbering became important parts of the local economy. A manufacturing area grew up south of downtown, near the railroads.Hicks:29Pickard:37 The first school for blacks in Gainesville, the Union Academy, was established in 1866 by the Freedmen's Bureau to educate freed slaves. White residents of Gainesville were opposed to education for blacks and treated the teachers at the school badly, including incidents of boys throwing \\"missiles\\" into the classrooms. By 1898 the school served 500 students, and it continued in operation until 1929.Rajtar:31-33Hildreth and Cox:60 White students had only private schools available before 1869, including the East Florida Seminary, which moved from Ocala in 1866 and merged with the Gainesville Academy (founded in 1856). Even after a public school system had been established in Alachua County, most white children who went to school did so at private schools, and the Union Academy was in session for a larger part of the year, and its teachers were better paid, than was the case for the public schools. Public education remained underfunded into the 1880s, classes having to meet in abandoned houses or rented rooms. The school year for public schools was as short as three months for some years. The first public school building was built in 1885. The Gainesville Graded and High School, with twelve classrooms and an auditorium, opened in 1900, and most of the private schools closed soon after. The county school board also provided some funds for upkeep of the Union Academy.Hildreth and Cox:60-61, 93-94Rajtar:26 There was no dedicated church building in Gainesville in the first years of its existence. A church built in 1859 by the Presbyterians was shared by itinerant preachers of several denominations until 1874. The Methodist mission to Gainesville lapsed during the Civil War, and a church they had built was used by a black congregation after the war. Several white Protestant denominations organized congregations and built churches in the 1870s. Catholics, who had been holding services in private homes for 25 years, built a church in 1887.Rajtar;27-8, 45-46Hildreth and Cox:59Hicks:55 Jewish families began moving to Gainesville in the late 1860s. Although a Jewish cemetery was established in 1872, there was no synagogue in Gainesville until 1924.Rajtar:34 Gainesville was a rough town after the Civil War and into the early 20th century. Whites and blacks commonly carried firearms, and gunshots were often heard at night. Killings and serious injuries were frequent. Some of the violence was racial. Young Mens Democratic Clubs (usually a cover name for the Ku Klux Klan), formed in the late 1860s to fight political domination by Republican northerners and blacks, reportedly burned the homes of many Republicans and killed nineteen people, including five blacks. A black man was taken from the jail and lynched in 1871. In 1891 a black man and a white man, members of a dreaded gang, were also taken from the jail and lynched. Later that year a black man accused of giving shelter to Harmon Murray, another member of that gang, was also taken from the jail and lynched. The city had only a single police officer until well into the 20th century, which was inadequate to deal with the violence. A posse authorized by the city council also did little to stem the violence. Punishments for crime included public executions, the pillory, lashes and fines.Braley:8, 57-66, 99-111Hildreth and Cox:58-59, 88-91Hicks:48 Epworth Hall, built in 1884; used by the East Florida Seminary until it merged with the University of Florida A volunteer fire department was organized in 1882, but was unable to stop several fires in 1884 that burned most of the wooden buildings in downtown Gainesville. The burned buildings were replaced with brick structures. A brick courthouse replaced the old wooden one in 1885. Public utilities were gradually installed in the city late in the 19th century; gas in 1887, water in 1891, and telephones and electricity later in the 1890s. By 1900 Gainesville was the seventh largest city in Florida, with over 3,600 residents.Pickard:2, 37 The Republican Party remained strong in Gainesville even after the end of Reconstruction in 1876 because of the large number of blacks and Northern whites who had moved there after the Civil War. Some Southerners had also joined the Republican Party. Alachua County was one of the few counties in Florida that was won by the Republican Party in the election of 1880. In the 1880s Republicans and Democrats reached an accommodation. In the election of 1883 most city races were won by wide majorities, with both Republicans and Democrats, white and blacks, being elected. There was tension within the Republican Party between blacks and Northern whites, however. By 1885 the arrival of whites from northern states and the departure of blacks gave Gainesville a white majority. The imposition by the Florida Legislature in 1889 of a poll tax and a de facto literacy test in the form of separate ballot boxes for each office, which required voters to be able to read labels on the boxes to vote correctly, effectively disenfranchised most blacks. Some blacks switched to the Democratic Party, further weakening the Republicans, and the Republican Party ceased to be a factor in Gainesville politics in the 1890s.Braley:129Hildreth and Cox:66-68, 87 20th century Gainesville, circa 1900 Major change came to Gainesville early in the 20th century. Citizens felt that the city did not have sufficient resources and powers to provide the services demanded in a growing city. The state legislature was asked to grant Gainesville a new charter, and in 1905 it did so, also enlarging the city limits. The city offered its first bond issue the same year. Money from bond issues was used to start a sewer system and pave important streets, initially with crushed rock, and after 1910, with bricks. When private companies were unable to provide adequate electric service to Gainesville, the city built a generating plant, which became operational in 1914.Hildreth and Cox:105-08 Another development in 1905 had a significant impact on the future of Gainesville. At the time, Florida was funding eight post-secondary schools. Concerned about rising requests for funding and duplication of course offerings, the state legislature passed the Buckman Act, consolidating the eight institutions into four segregated schools, including, for white men, the University of the State of Florida (renamed University of Florida in 1909). \\"University of Florida's Beginnings\\", Retrieved 2011-06-30 Gainesville competed for the university, with Lake City as its principal rival. Gainesville offered free water for the school from the city system, west of the city, purchase of the East Florida Seminary site from the state for $30,000, and $40,000 cash. The fact that Alachua was a dry county, banning the sale of all alcohol other than low- alcohol beer, was viewed as a factor in favor of Gainesville. The state selected Gainesville, causing the biggest celebration in the history of the city.Hildreth and Cox:102-04 The university opened with 136 students in the fall of 1906. For the first decade of the school's existence it was in a rural setting, connected to downtown Gainesville by a single crushed rock road. The school had to close its gates at night to keep wandering cows out.Hildreth and Cox:104 Buildings at the university were originally built with state funds, but in 1919 the city contributed $1,000 for a new gymnasium to help bring the New York Giants to town for spring training. As the university grew, commercial establishments spread westward along University Avenue and new subdivisions were developed near the campus.McCarthy and Laurie:175Pickard:31 Boulware Springs Waterworks The city experienced growing pains in the first decades of the century. The city's only water supply had been Boulware Springs for many years, but the limits of its supply had been reached, and the city could no longer connect new subdivisions to city utilities. A bond issue was required to drill a well and build a water tower. A fire house was built in 1903, and the fire department was modernized, replacing its last horses with motorized equipment in 1913. However, the department remained a volunteer organization until the 1920s.Hildreth and Cox:108-09 Gainesville's economy was still dominated by agriculture. Gainesville was a major shipping point for cotton until the industry was devastated by the boll weevil infestation in 1916–18, after which cotton was abandoned as a crop in the area. Truck farming had become important in north central Florida, with large shipments of vegetables and melons from Gainesville to markets in the northern US. Phosphate mining continued to be important, although starting to decline, and industries such as processing naval stores and making fertilizer thrived in Gainesville. World War I severely affected the economy in Gainesville. Markets in Europe, in particular Germany, were cut off by the war, and phosphate mining and the naval stores industry went into a slump, aggravated by the loss of cotton processing and shipping.Hildreth and Cox:110-11 Boom and bust Seagle Building Gainesville participated in the national economic boom that followed the end of World War I. In 1925, Gainesville was swept up by the land boom that had started in Miami Beach earlier in the year. New subdivisions were platted and auctioned, binders on property were sold and resold with ever-increasing prices, and almost 100 real estate brokers and agents were registered in Gainesville on the first day licenses were required. Plans were floated to build a modern first-class hotel in Gainesville. After a false start in which the financing plans fell through, a developer from southern Florida who had become heavily involved in the real estate market in Gainesville, W. McKey Kelly, put forward plans for a ten-story, 120-room hotel. Construction on the Hotel Kelly, also known as the Dixie Hotel, started in 1926, but Kelly ran out of money before construction was completed, and the collapse of the land boom doomed the project. The unfinished hotel sat empty for more than a decade until a federal grant and private donation allowed its completion as the Seagle Building.Hildreth and Cox:122-28 Glen Springs hosted the first concrete swimming pool in Gainesville in the mid-1920s. It was a popular recreation site for over 40 years. Changes in city government occurred in the 1920s. The city changed its charter to add a city manager. The police force was increased from three men to nine, and a desk sergeant was available to answer a telephone 24 hours a day. A county hospital opened in Gainesville in 1928. More streets were paved, using asphalt rather than bricks. Increasing demand for electricity led the city commission to consider contracting with Florida Power and Light rather than issuing bonds to expand the city generating capacity, but voters passed an amendment to the city charter forbidding any such deal. With a booming population, schools had become overcrowded. Gainesville High School was opened in 1926 and expanded two years later. The old Gainesville Graded and High School became an elementary school.Hildreth and Cox:131-38 Lincoln School, offering 12 grades for African- Americans, opened in 1923, replacing the Union Academy, which had served African-American students since 1867. The Ku Klux Klan became active in Gainesville in the early 1920s. As elsewhere, it was anti-black, anti-semitic, and anti-Catholic, and professed to uphold morality. In an early incident, a worker was kidnapped from his job late at night and beaten severely for neglecting his wife and children. A police officer had tried to intervene, but retreated when guns were drawn. City officials condoned the incident. Former mayor William Reuben Thomas condemned the event and called for the mayor and police chief, who apparently were members of the Klan, to step down, to no avail. The Klan also objected to a Catholic priest who had organized a drama club at the University, and in 1923 Catholic priests were officially banned from all state college campuses. The next year three men in full Klan regalia kidnapped the priest from his rectory, beat him severely, and castrated him. The priest and another witness identified two of the kidnappers as the mayor and police chief of Gainesville, but there was no publicity and no investigation of the incident. In the 1930s the Klan took credit for burning down the houses of prostitution on North Main Street, ostensibly to protect the morals of the students at the University.Hildreth and Cox:139-40, 183Newton:59-60, 68-69 The collapse of the land boom in 1925–1926 had not been as severe in Gainesville as in southern Florida, but did cool off the local economy. As a result, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 was not felt as strongly as in many other places. The city of Gainesville remained solvent throughout the Great Depression, and unemployment was lower than in most of the country. Agriculture continued to be a mainstay of the local economy. In 1922 tung trees were planted in Alachua County, and Gainesville became the center of tung oil production in the United States. Tung oil had previously been available only from China. Both tung oil and tung tree seeds were shipped around the world from Gainesville. The University of Florida, with about 1,000 employees and 2,000 students, helped stabilize the local economy during the Depression. In the middle and late 1930s various New Deal programs brought money and employment to Gainesville. Utility lines were extended, streets paved and sidewalks installed. The Seagle Building was completed and occupied by the University of Florida. An airport, Gainesville's first, was built.Hildreth and Cox:143-50 World War II and after World War II brought economic and population growth to Gainesville. Even before the United States entered the war, the opening of Camp Blanding affected Gainesville, with soldiers on leave visiting the city, and officers renting housing for their families. The airport was improved and taken over by the Army Air Corps as the Alachua Army Airbase. Agriculture prospered and local industries received contracts for producing military supplies. Building construction also increased. The hospital was expanded with financial help from the federal government. The university was used to train enlisted men, air cadets and officers.Hildreth and Cox:152-57 The end of World War II brought even more growth to Gainesville. The G.I. Bill allowed war veterans to attend college, and enrollment at the University of Florida boomed. More than half of the approximately 9,000 students at the university in 1946–47 were veterans. Many of the veterans had families, straining housing availability in the city. The university became co-educational in 1947, with the admission of over 800 women. The population of Gainesville doubled from 1940 to 1950, with construction and employment at the university becoming more important in the city's economy. The city's power plant was inadequate for demand. The federal government had required the city to buy electricity from private power companies rather than expand its own generating capacity during World War II. After the voters again rejected a proposal for the city to buy electric power wholesale, the city embarked on a major expansion of power generation. The water and sewer systems also were greatly expanded. The airport was returned to the city, and scheduled passenger flights started in 1950. The police department expanded from about 10 officers in the 1930s to 40 by 1950. Also in 1950, the old system of named streets was replaced by a quadrant system of numbered streets.Hildreth and Cox:158-65 The rapid growth of Gainesville put a strain on the public schools. When residents voted down proposals to issue bonds for school construction, the school board acquired surplus barracks from army bases to use as temporary classroom. The newer residents helped to pass school bond issues beginning in the 1950s. The return of veterans to Gainesville and the growth of the university also began to influence politics in Gainesville. In the 1930s, land ownership in and around Gainesville, and with it political power, had become concentrated in fewer hands. Veterans returning to the city after World War II had difficulty entering financial and political inner circles. University faculty and staff had been well integrated into the community before the war, but the growth after the war brought in many faculty who were dissatisfied with the political status quo in Gainesville.Hildreth and Cox:172-73, 178-79 To avert tensions with local politicians, J. Hillis Miller, president of the university from 1947 to 1953, barred university faculty and staff from participating in local politics.Washington:5 During the 1960s, Gainesville became a center for college activism, and was described by then-professor Marshall Jones as \\"The Berkeley of the South\\". The city was the center of the Gainesville Eight case in the 1970s, in which eight activists were accused of conspiracy to violently disrupt the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach. After their acquittal, activism declined, but rose again during the mid-1980s, as the University of Florida became the state's focal point for anti-apartheid activism. The city gained notoriety in 2010 and 2011 after local church Dove World Outreach Center was involved in anti-sharia law campaigns, Quran burnings, the promotion of the \\"Innocence of Muslims\\" movie trailer and anti- mosque campaigns.Aswad, Evelyn M., Rashad Hussan, and M.

The recorded history of Grand Rapids in the U.S. state of Michigan, began with settlers in 1806. Pre- Columbian settlement A 1772 engraving showing Ottawa attire of the period. For thousands of years, succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples occupied the area. Over 2000 years ago, people associated with the Hopewell culture occupied the Grand River Valley. Later, a tribe from the Ottawa River traveled to the Grand River valley, fighting three battles with the Prairie Indians who were established in the area. The tribe later split, with the Chippewas settling in the northern lower peninsula, the Pottawatomies staying south of the Kalamazoo River and the Ottawa staying in central Michigan. By the late 1600s, the Ottawa, who occupied territory around the Great Lakes and spoke one of the numerous Algonquian languages, moved into the Grand Rapids area and founded several villages along the Grand River. The Ottawa established on the river, which they called O-wash-ta-nong, or far-away-water due to the river's length, where they \\"raised corn, melons, pumpkins and beans, to which they added game of the woods and the fish from the streams\\". In 1740, an Ottawa man who would later be known as Chief Noonday and become the future chief of the Ottawa, was born. Between 1761 and 1763, Chief Pontiac visited the area annually, gathering over 3,000 natives and asking them to volunteer to fight the British in Detroit, which would culminate into Pontiac's War. The Potawatomi attacked the Ottawa in 1765, attempting to take the Grand River territory but were defeated. By the end of the 1700s, there were an estimated 1,000 Ottawa in the Kent County area. European settlement After the French established territories in Michigan, Jesuit missionaries and traders traveled down Lake Michigan and its tributaries. At the start of the 19th century, European fur traders (mostly French Canadian and Métis) and missionaries established posts in the area among the Ottawa. They generally lived in peace, trading European metal and textile goods for fur pelts. In 1806, Joseph and his wife Madeline La Framboise, who was Métis, traveled by canoe from Mackinac and established the first trading post in West Michigan in present-day Grand Rapids on the banks of the Grand River, near what is now Ada Township. They were French-speaking and Roman Catholic. They likely both spoke Ottawa, Madeline's maternal ancestral language. After the murder of her husband in 1809 while en route to Grand Rapids, Madeline La Framboise carried on the trade business, expanding fur trading posts to the west and north, creating a good reputation among the American Fur Company. La Framboise, whose mother was Ottawa and father French, later merged her successful operations with the American Fur Company. By 1810, Chief Noonday established a village on the west side of the river with about 500 Ottawa. Madeline La Framboise retired the trading post to Rix Robinson in 1821 and returned to Mackinac. That year, Grand Rapids was described as being the home of an Ottawa village of about 50 to 60 huts on the west side of the river near the 5th Ward, with Kewkishkam being the village chief and Chief Noonday being the chief of the Ottawa. American settlement The first permanent European-American settler in the Grand Rapids area was Isaac McCoy, a Baptist minister. General Lewis Cass, who commissioned Charles Christopher Trowbridge to establish missions for Native Americans in Michigan, ordered McCoy to establish a mission in Grand Rapids for the Ottawa. In 1823, McCoy, as well as Paget, a Frenchman who brought along a Native American pupil, traveled to Grand Rapids to arrange a mission, though negotiations fell through with the group returning to the Carey mission for the Potawatomi on the St. Joseph River. In 1824, Baptist missionary Rev. L. Slater traveled with two settlers to Grand Rapids to perform work. The winter of 1824 proved to be difficult, with Slater's group having to resupply and return before the spring. Slater then erected the first settler structures in Grand Rapids, a log cabin for himself and a log schoolhouse. In 1825, McCoy returned and established a missionary station.Goss, Dwight. The Indians of the Grand River Valley, In Michigan Historical Collections, Vol. 30, pp. 178-80 (1906). He represented the settlers who began arriving from Ohio, New York and New England, the Yankee states of the Northern Tier. A sketch of Grand Rapids in 1831. The collection of houses across the river on its west side is the Baptist mission. The three buildings in the middle right are Louis Campau's trading post. Shortly after, Detroit-born Louis Campau, known as the official founder of Grand Rapids, was convinced by fur trader William Brewster, who was in a rivalry with the American Fur Company, to travel to Grand Rapids and establish trade there. In 1826, Campau built his cabin, trading post, and blacksmith shop on the east bank of the Grand River near the rapids, stating that the Native Americans in the area were \\"friendly and peaceable\\". Campau returned to Detroit, then returned a year later with his wife and $5,000 of trade goods to trade with the Ottawa and Ojibwa, with the only currency being fur. Campau's younger brother Touissant would often assist him with trade and other tasks at hand. In 1831 the federal survey of the Northwest Territory reached the Grand River; it set the boundaries for Kent County, named after prominent New York jurist James Kent. In 1833, a land office was established in White Pigeon, Michigan, with Campau and fellow settler Luther Lincoln seeking land in the Grand River valley. Lincoln purchased land in what is now known as Grandville, while Campau became perhaps the most important settler when he bought 72 acres (291,000 m²) from the federal government for $90 and named his tract Grand Rapids. Over time, it developed as today's main downtown business district. In the spring of 1833, Campau sold Joel Guild, who traveled from New York, a plot of land for $25.00, with Guild building the first frame structure in Grand Rapids, which is now where McKay Tower stands. Guild later became the postmaster, with mail at the time being delivered monthly from the Gull Lake, Michigan to Grand Rapids. Grand Rapids in 1833 was only a few acres of land cleared on each side of the Grand River, with oak trees planted in light, sandy soil standing between what is now Lyon Street and Fulton Street. The large framed building constructed by Campau in 1834, seen in this image converted into part of the Rathbun House. By 1834, the settlement had become more organized. Rev. Turner had established a school on the east side of the river, with children on the west side of the river being brought to school every morning by a Native American on a canoe who would shuttle them across the river. Multiple events happened at Guild's frame structure, including the first marriage in the city, one that involved his daughter Harriet Guild and Barney Burton, as well as the first town meeting that had nine voters. It was also this year Campau began constructing his own frame building—the largest at the time—near where present-day Rosa Parks Circle. In 1835, many settlers arrived in the area with the population growing to about 50 people, including its first doctor, Dr. Wilson, who was supplied with equipment from Campau. Lucius Lyon, a Yankee Protestant who would later become a rival to Campau arrived in Grand Rapids who purchased the rest of the prime land and called his plot the Village of Kent. When Lyon and his partner N. O. Sergeant returned after their purchase, they arrived along with a posse of men carrying shovels and picks, with the goal of building a mill race. The posse arrived to the music of a bugle, startling the settlement with Chief Noonday offering Campau assistance to drive back Lyon's posse believing they were invaders. Also that year, Rev. Andrew Vizoisky, a Hungarian native educated in Catholic institutions in Austria, arrived, presiding over the Catholic mission in the area until his death in 1852. That year, Campau, Rix Robinson, Rev. Slater and the husband of Chief Noonday's daughter, Meccissininni, traveled to Washington, D.C. to speak about the purchase of Ottawa land on the west side of the river with President Andrew Jackson. Jackson was originally unimpressed with Meccissininni, though Meccissininni, who often acquired white customs, asked Jackson for a similar suit to the one the president was wearing. While later wearing his suit that was made similar to Jackson's, Meccissininni also unknowingly imitated Jackson's hat, placing a piece of weed in it, which impressed Jackson since it symbolized mourning the death of his wife. John Ball, representing a group of New York land speculators, bypassed Detroit for a better deal in Grand Rapids traveling to the settlement in 1836. Ball declared the Grand River valley \\"the promised land, or at least the most promising one for my operations\\". That year, the first steam boat was constructed on the Grand River named the Gov. Mason, though the ship wrecked two years later in Muskegon. Yankee migrants (primarily English-speaking settlers) and others began migrating from New York and New England through the 1830s. Ancestors of these people included not only English colonists but people of mixed ethnic Dutch, Mohawk, French Canadian, and French Huguenot descent from the colonial period in New York. However, after 1837, the area saw poor times, with many of the French returning to their places of origin, with poverty hitting the area for the next few years. The first Grand Rapids newspaper, The Grand River Times, was printed on April 18, 1837, describing the village's attributes, stating: The Grand River Times continued, saying the village had grown quickly from a few French families to about 1,200 residents, the Grand River was \\"one of the most important and delightful to be found in the country\\", and described the changing Native American culture in the area. City of Grand Rapids =1800s= An 1868 pictorial map of Grand Rapids. By 1838, the settlement incorporated as a village, and encompassed approximately three-quarters of a mile (1 km) . The first formal census in 1845 recorded a population of 1,510 and an area of . The city of Grand Rapids was incorporated April 2, 1850. It was officially established on May 2, 1850, when the village of Grand Rapids voted to accept the proposed city charter. The population at the time was 2,686. By 1857, the city of Grand Rapids' area totaled . In October 1870, Grand Rapids became a desired location for immigrants, with about 120 Swedes arriving in the United States to travel and create a \\"colony\\" in the area in one week. In 1880, the country's first hydro-electric generator was put to use on the city's west side. Grand Rapids was an early center for the automobile industry, as the Austin Automobile Company operated here from 1901 until 1921. Gypsum mining An outcropping of gypsum, where Plaster Creek enters the Grand River, was known to the Native American inhabitants of the area. Pioneer geologist Douglass Houghton commented on this find in 1838. Settlers began to mine this outcrop in 1841, initially in open cast mines, but later underground mines as well. Gypsum was ground locally for use as a soil amendment known as \\"land plaster.\\" The Alabastine Mine in nearby Wyoming, Michigan, was originally dug in 1907 to provide gypsum for the manufacture of stucco and wall coverings, notably the alabastine favored by Arts and Crafts Movement architects. The mine has since been converted to a storage facility primarily used for computer servers and Kent County document storage. =1900s= In 1945, Grand Rapids became the first city in the United States to add fluoride to its drinking water. Downtown Grand Rapids, when the center of business, used to host four department stores: Herpolsheimer's (Lazarus in 1987), Jacobson's, Steketee's (founded in 1862), and Wurzburg's. Shopping was a community event. As with many older cities, these businesses suffered as the population moved to suburbs in the postwar era with federal subsidization of highway construction. In addition, retail changes in buying habits affected business. Consolidation of department stores occurred here and nationally in the 1980s and 1990s. Furniture City During the second half of the 19th century, the city became a major lumbering center, processing timber harvested in the region. Logs were floated down the Grand River to be milled in the city and shipped via the Great Lakes. The city became a center of fine wood products as well. By the end of the century, it was established as the premier furniture-manufacturing city of the United States. It was nicknamed \\"Furniture City\\" and exhibited many of its products at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. \\"After an international exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876, Grand Rapids became recognized worldwide as a leader in the production of fine furniture.\\"Bray, Nicole and DuShane, Robert (2013). Ghosts of Grand Rapids, pp. 13-14. The History Press. This event in Philadelphia, attended by hundreds of thousands of people, helped spark the Colonial Revival movement in American furniture. \\"Grand Rapids furniture\\" became a byword for well-made reproductions of American and English 18th and early 19th-century styles. Furniture companies included the William A. Berkey Company and its successors, Baker Furniture Company, Williams-Kimp, and Widdicomb Furniture Company.\\"Furniture Detective: Not all antique Grand Rapids furniture is grand\\", The Antique Trader The Grand Rapids Furniture Record was the trade paper for the city's industry. Its industries provided jobs for many new immigrants from Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century, and a Polish neighborhood developed on the west side of the city. A furniture-makers' guild was established in 1931 to improve the design and craftsmanship of Grand Rapids furniture. National home furnishing markets were held in Grand Rapids for about 75 years, concluding in the 1960s. By that time, the furniture- making industry had largely shifted to North Carolina.\\"North Carolina, the Furniture Capital of the World\\", Visit NC. Although local employment in the industry is lower than at its historic peak, Grand Rapids remains a leading city in office furniture production. It incorporated trends to use steel and other manufactured materials in furniture, with ergonomic designs for chairs, computer stations, and other furnishings.

Pre-European settlement (to 1716) Great Temple on Mound C and the Sun Chiefs cabin, drawn by Alexandre de Batz in the 1730s According to archaeological excavations, the area has been continuously inhabited by various cultures of indigenous peoples since the 8th century A.D. The original site of Natchez was developed as a major village with ceremonial platform mounds, built by people of the prehistoric Plaquemine culture, part of the influential Mississippian culture and active in this area from about 700 AD. Archaeological evidence shows they began construction of the three main earthwork mounds by 1200. Additional work was done in the mid-15th century. By the late 17th and early 18th century, the Natchez (pronounced \\"Nochi\\"), descendants of the Plaquemine culture, occupied the site. They used it as their major ceremonial center, after leaving the area of Emerald Mound. They added to the mounds, including a residence for their chief, the \\"Great Sun\\", on Mound B, and a combined temple and charnel house for the elite on Mound C. Many early European explorers, including Hernando de Soto, La Salle and Bienville, made contact with the Natchez at this site, called the Grand Village of the Natchez. Their accounts provided descriptions of the society and village. The most thorough account was written by French colonists Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz, who lived near the Natchez for several years, learning their language and befriending leaders. He witnessed the 1725 funeral of the war chief, Tattooed Serpent (Serpent Piqué in French.) The Natchez maintained a hierarchical society, divided into nobles and commoners, with people affiliated according to matrilineal descent. The paramount chief, known as the \\"Great Sun\\", owed his position to the rank of his mother. His next eldest brother served as Tattooed Serpent. The site of the Grand Village of the Natchez is preserved as a National Historic Landmark; it is maintained by the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. The site includes a museum with artifacts from the mounds and village. A picnic pavilion and walking trails are also available on the grounds. Nearby Emerald Mound is also a National Historic Landmark of the Natchez and their ancestors. Colonial history (1716–1783) In 1716 the French founded Fort Rosalie, to protect the trading post which had been established two years earlier in the Natchez territory. Permanent French settlements and plantations were subsequently developed a dangerous distance from the fort and too near important native locales.Barnett, Jr., James F. (2007). The Natchez Indians: a history to 1735. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. p.80. . The French inhabitants of the \\"Natchez colony\\" often came into conflict with the Natchez people over land use and resources. This was one of several Natchez settlements; others lay to the northeast. The Natchez tended to become increasingly split into pro-French and pro-English factions; those who were more distant had more relations with English traders, who came to the area from British colonies to the east. After several smaller wars, the Natchez (together with the Chickasaw and Yazoo) launched a war to eliminate the French in November 1729. It became known by the Europeans as the \\"Natchez War\\" or Natchez Rebellion. The Indians destroyed the French colony at Natchez and other settlements in the area. On November 29, 1729, the Natchez Indians killed a total of 229 French colonists: 138 men, 35 women, and 56 children (the largest death toll by an Indian attack in Mississippi's history). They took most of the women and children as captives. The French with their Indian allies attacked the Natchez repeatedly over the next two years, resulting in most of the Natchez Indians being killed, enslaved, or forced to flee as refugees. After surrender of the leader and several hundred Natchez in 1731, the French took their prisoners to New Orleans, where they were forcibly sold as slaves and shipped as laborers on the Caribbean plantations of Saint- Domingue, as ordered by the French prime minister Maurepas. Ginny Walker English, \\"Natchez Massacre 1729\\", State Coordinator, Mississippi American Local History Network, 2000–2001, accessed 3 May 2009 Many of the Natchez who escaped enslavement sought refuge with the Creek and Cherokee peoples, ultimately being absorbed into their people.The Natchez Indians; by Barnett, Jim; Mississippi History Now; accessed August 2015 Descendants of the Natchez diaspora have reorganized and survive as the Natchez Nation, a treaty tribe and confederate of the federally recognized Muscogee (Creek) Nation, with a sovereign traditional government. Following the Seven Years' War, in 1763 Fort Rosalie and the surrounding town, renamed for the defeated tribe, came under British rule. About twenty years later, the area was under Spanish colonial rule. After defeat in the American Revolutionary War, Great Britain ceded the territory to the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1783). Spain was not a party to the treaty, and it was their forces who had taken Natchez from British troops. Although Spain had been allied with the American colonists, they were more interested in advancing their power at the expense of Britain. Once the war was over, they were not inclined to give up that which they had acquired by force. A census of the Natchez District taken in 1784 counted 1,619 people, including 498 black slaves. Antebellum (1783–1860) \\"The Parsonage\\" historic house was built in 1852 in Natchez. Methodist. Another Natchez antebellum home available for tours is Stanton Hall, built c. 1858 and located on a whole city block at 401 High Street. Federal-style house at State and Wall streets, Natchez MS. C. 1820.In the late 18th century, Natchez was the starting point of the Natchez Trace overland route, a Native American trail that followed a path established by migrating animals, most likely buffalo, which ran from Natchez to Nashville through what are now Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. Produce and goods were transported on the Mississippi River by the flatboatmen and keelboatmen, who usually sold their wares at Natchez or New Orleans, including their boats (as lumber). They made the long trek back north to their homes overland on the Natchez Trace. The boatmen were locally called \\"Kaintucks\\" because they were usually from Kentucky, although the entire Ohio River Valley was well- represented among their numbers. The Trace was traveled heavily until the development of steamboats in the 1820s allowed northward navigation (against the current) on the River. On October 27, 1795, the U.S. and Spanish signed the Treaty of San Lorenzo, settling their decade-long boundary dispute. All Spanish claims to Natchez were formally surrendered to the United States. More than two years passed before official orders reached the Spanish garrison there. It surrendered the fort and possession of Natchez to United States forces led by Captain Isaac Guion on March 30, 1798. A week later, Natchez became the first capital of the new Mississippi Territory, created by the Adams administration. After it served for several years as the territorial capital, the territory built a new capital, named Washington, to the east, also in Adams County. After roughly 15 years, the legislature transferred the capital back to Natchez at the end of 1817, when the territory was admitted as a state. Later the capital was returned to Washington. As the state's population center shifted to the north and east with more settlers entering the area, the legislature voted to move the capital to the more centrally located city of Jackson in 1822. In 1830 the population of Natchez was 2,789. Throughout the course of the early nineteenth century, Natchez was the center of economic activity for the young state. Its strategic location on the high bluffs on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River enabled it to develop into a bustling port. At Natchez, many local plantation owners had their cotton loaded onto steamboats at the landing known as Natchez Under-the-HillNatchez Under-the-Hill at Friends of Our Riverfront, retrieved 24 May 2017. to be transported downriver to New Orleans or, sometimes, upriver to St. Louis or Cincinnati. The cotton was sold and shipped to New England, New York, and European spinning and textile mills. Commercial Bank in downtown Natchez, established in 1836, is built in the Greek Revival style of architecture. The banker lived in a house to the rear of the structure. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Natchez District, along with the Sea Islands of South Carolina and Georgia, pioneered cotton agriculture in the United States. Until new hybridized breeds of short-staple cotton were created in the early nineteenth century, it was unprofitable to grow cotton in the United States anywhere other than those two areas. Although South Carolina had dominated the cotton plantation culture in the eighteenth century and early in the Antebellum South, it was the Natchez District which first experimented with hybridization, making the cotton boom possible. Historians attribute the major part of the expansion of cotton in the Deep South to Eli Whitney's development of the cotton gin; it lowered processing costs for short-staple cotton, making this profitable for cultivation. It was the kind of cotton that could be grown on uplands and throughout the Black Belt of the Deep South. Development of cotton plantations expanded rapidly, increasing demand for slaves in the South. They were sold in the domestic slave trade chiefly from the Upper South. The growth of the cotton industry attracted many new white settlers to Mississippi, who competed with the Choctaw for their land. Despite land cessions, the settlers continued to encroach on Choctaw territory, leading to conflict. With the election of President Andrew Jackson in 1828, he pressed for Indian removal, gaining Congressional passage of an act authorizing that in 1830. Starting with the Choctaw, the government began removal of Southeastern Indians in 1831 to lands west of the Mississippi River in Indian Territory. Nearly 15,000 Choctaw left their traditional homeland over the next two years. Natchez in the 1850s The terrain around Natchez on the Mississippi side of the river is hilly. The city sits on a high bluff above the Mississippi River; to reach the riverbank, one must travel down a steep road to the landing called Silver Street, which is in marked contrast to the flat \\"delta\\" lowland found across the river surrounding the city of Vidalia, Louisiana. Its early planter elite built numerous antebellum mansions and estates. Many owned plantations in Louisiana but chose to locate their homes on the higher ground in Mississippi. Prior to the Civil War, Natchez had more millionaires than any other city in the United States.Peter Tonge, \\"Natchez: in 1850 half of the millionaires in the US lived here\\", The Christian Science Monitor, MARCH 22, 1983. It was frequented by notables such as Aaron Burr, Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, Zachary Taylor, Ulysses S. Grant, Jefferson Davis, Winfield Scott, and John James Audubon. Today the city boasts that it has more antebellum homes than any other city in the U.S., as during the Civil War Natchez was spared the destruction of many other Southern cities. The Forks of the Road Market had the highest volume of illegal slave sales in Natchez, and Natchez had the most active illegal slave trading market in Mississippi. This also stimulated the city's wealth. The market, at the intersection of two streets, became especially important after the slave traders Isaac Franklin of Tennessee and John Armfield of Virginia purchased the land in 1823. Tens of thousands of mistreated slaves passed through the market, transported from Virginia and the Upper South (many by walking overland), and destined for the plantations in the Deep South. In this forced migration, more than one million enslaved Black American were taken from their families and moved southward. All trading at the market ceased by the summer of 1863, when Union troops occupied Natchez.Jim Barnett and H. Clark Burkett, \\"The Forks of the Road Slave Market at Natchez,\\" Journal of Mississippi History, Sept 2001, Vol. 63 Issue 3, pp 168–187 Prior to 1845 and the founding of the Natchez Institute, the city's elite residents were the only ones who could afford a formal education for their children. Although many parents did not have much schooling themselves, they were anxious to provide their children with a quality education. Schools opened in the city as early as 1801, but many of the wealthiest families continued to rely on private tutors or out-of-state institutions, some sending their children as far as England and Scotland. The city founded the Natchez Institute to offer free education to the rest of the white residents. Although children from a variety of economic backgrounds could obtain an education, class differences persisted among students, particularly in terms of school choice and social ties. Although it was considered illegal, black slave children were often taught the alphabet and reading the Bible by their white playmates in private homes.Julia Huston Nguyen, \\"The Value of Learning: Education and Class in Antebellum Natchez,\\" Journal of Mississippi History, Sept 1999, Vol. 61 Issue 3, pp 237–263, American Civil War (1861–1865) William Henry Elder, Bishop of Natchez Union Army forces under U.S. Grant occupied Rosalie Mansion in Natchez after the Battle of Vicksburg in 1863. During the Civil War, Natchez remained largely undamaged. The city surrendered to Flag-Officer David G. Farragut after the fall of New Orleans in May 1862. (available at gutenberg.org) Two civilians, an elderly man and an eight-year-old girl named Rosalie Beekman, were killed when a Union ironclad shelled the town from the River. The man died of a heart attack and Rosalie was killed by a shell fragment. Union troops under Ulysses S. Grant occupied Natchez in 1863; Grant set up his temporary headquarters in the Natchez mansion Rosalie.\\"A Brief History of Rosalie Mansion\\" , official website Some Natchez residents remained defiant of the Federal authorities. In 1864, William Henry Elder, the Catholic bishop of the Diocese of Natchez, refused to obey a Federal order to compel his parishioners to pray for the President of the United States. U.S. officials arrested Elder, jailed him briefly, and banished him across the river to Confederate-held Vidalia. Elder was eventually allowed to return to Natchez and resume his clerical duties there. He served until 1880, when he was elevated to Archbishop of Cincinnati. Ellen Shields's memoir reveals a Southern woman's reactions to Yankee military occupation of the city. Shields' memoir portrays the upheaval of Southern society during the war. Because Southern men were absent at war, many elite women had to exercise their class- based femininity and sexual appeal to deal with the Yankees.Joyce L.. Broussard, \\"Occupied Natchez, Elite Women, and the Feminization of the Civil War,\\" Journal of Mississippi History, Summer 2008, Vol. 70 Issue 2, pp 179–208 In 1860, there were 340 planters in the Natchez region who each owned 250 or more slaves; not all of these were enthusiastic Confederates. The exceptions tended to be fairly recent arrivals to the South, men who opposed secession, and some who held social and economic ties to the North. These planters lacked a strong emotional attachment to the South; but when war came, many of their sons and nephews joined the Confederate army anyway.William K. Scarborough, \\"Not Quite Southern: The Precarious Allegiance of the Natchez Nabobs in the Sectional Crisis,\\" Prologue, Winter 2004, Vol. 36 Issue 4, pp 20–29 Charles Dahlgren was among the recent migrants; from Philadelphia, he had made his fortune before the war. He did support the Confederacy and led a brigade, but was criticized for failing to defend the Gulf Coast. When the Yankees came, he moved to Georgia for the duration of the war. He returned in 1865 but never recouped his fortune. He had to declare bankruptcy, and in 1870 he gave up and moved to New York City.Herschel Gower, Charles Dahlgren of Natchez: The Civil War and Dynastic Decline (2003) Following the Union victory at the Battle of Vicksburg in July, 1863, many refugees, including former slaves, freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, began moving into Natchez and the surrounding countryside. The Union Army officers claimed to be short on resources and unable to provide for the refugees. The Army planned to address the situation with a mixture of paid labor for freed slaves on government leased plantations, the enlistment of able bodied males who were willing to fight in the Union Army and the establishment of refugee camps where former slaves could be provided with education. However, as the war continued, the plan was never effectively implemented and the leased plantations were poorly managed and frequently raided by Confederate troops who controlled the surrounding territory. Hundreds of people living in Natchez during this period, including many former slaves and refugees, died of hunger, disease or were killed in the fighting during this period. Confederate graves in a portion of the Natchez City Cemetery White Natchez residents became much more pro-Confederate 'after' the war. The Lost Cause myth arose as a means for coming to terms with the South's defeat. It quickly became a definitive ideology, strengthened by celebratory activities, speeches, clubs, and statues. The major organizations dedicated to creating and maintaining the tradition were the United Daughters of the Confederacy and United Confederate Veterans. In Natchez and other cities, although the local newspapers and war veterans played a role in the maintenance of the Lost Cause, elite white women were particularly important—especially in establishing cemeteries and memorials, such as the Civil War monument dedicated on Memorial Day 1890. The Lost Cause enabled (white) noncombatants to lay a claim to the watershed event in the reshaping of Southern history.Melody Kubassek, \\"Ask Us Not to Forget: The Lost Cause in Natchez, Mississippi,\\" Southern Studies, 1992, Vol. 3 Issue 3, pp 155–170 Postwar period (1865–1900) Natchez–Vidalia Bridge over the Mississippi River Natchez Convention Center is across from the Grand Hotel. Grand Hotel in downtown Natchez Bowie's Tavern at 84 Homochitto Street in downtown Natchez Natchez made a rapid economic comeback in the postwar years, with the resumption of much of the commercial shipping traffic on the Mississippi River. The cash crop was still cotton, but gang agricultural slave labor came to be largely replaced by sharecropping, in which freedmen felt they had some independence. In many families, women left field labor to care for their own people. During hard times, they might work for their family and later had to take up domestic service. In addition to cotton, the development of local industries such as logging added to the exports through the city's wharf. In return, Natchez saw an influx of manufactured goods from northern markets such as Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis. The city's prominent place in Mississippi River commerce during the nineteenth century was reflected by the naming of nine steamboats Natchez, which traveled the lower river between 1823 and 1918. Many were built for and commanded by the famous Captain Thomas P. Leathers, whom Jefferson Davis had wanted to head the Confederate defense fleet on the Mississippi River. (This appointment never was concluded.) In 1885, the Anchor Line, known for its luxury steamboats operating between St. Louis and New Orleans, launched its \\"brag boat\\", the City of Natchez. This ship operated for a year before being lost to a fire at Cairo, Illinois, on 28 December 1886. Since 1975, an excursion steamboat at New Orleans has borne the name Natchez. Such river commerce sustained the city's economic growth until just after the turn of the twentieth century, when steamboat traffic began to be replaced by the railroads. The city's economy declined over the course of the 20th century, as did that of many Mississippi River towns bypassed by railroad traffic. Tourism has helped to compensate for the decline. After the war and during Reconstruction, the world of domestic servants in Natchez changed somewhat in response to emancipation and freedom. After the Civil War, most domestic servants continued to be black women. Often, the women were supporting children; although they were poorly paid, their domestic work produced important income for family maintenance. White employers often continued the paternalism that had characterized relations between slaveholders and slaves. They often preferred black workers to white servants. White men and women who worked as domestics generally held positions such as gardener or governess, while black servants worked as cooks, maids, and laundresses.Julia Huston Nguyen, \\"Laying the Foundations: Domestic Service in Natchez, 1862–1877,\\" Journal of Mississippi History, March 2001, Vol. 63 Issue 1, pp 34–60 Since 1900 A view of downtown Natchez For a short time, the women's school Stanton College in Natchez educated daughters of the white elite. It was located in Stanton Hall, built as a private mansion in 1858. During the early 20th century, the college was a site of negotiation, as daughters of the traditional planter class encountered those of the new commercial elite. Other interplay took place between traditional parents and their more modern daughters. The young women joined social clubs and literary societies, which helped to maintain relations among cousins and family friends. The coursework included classes in proper behavior and letter writing, as well as skills that might enable those suffering from genteel poverty to make a living. The girls often balked at dress codes and rules, but also replicated their parents' social values. Stanton Hall was designated as a National Historic Landmark in the late 20th century.Cita Cook, \\"The Modernized Elitism of Young Southern Ladies at Early Twentieth-Century Stanton College,\\" Journal of Mississippi History, Sept 2000, Vol. 62 Issue 3, pp 199–223 Located on the Mississippi River, the town long had an active nightlife, featuring jazz and blues created and played by Black American musicians. On April 23, 1940, 209 people died in a fire at the Rhythm Night Club, a black dance hall in Natchez. The local paper remarked that \\"203 black bought 50 cent tickets to eternity.\\" This fire has been noted as the fourth-deadliest fire in U.S. history. Several blues songs pay tribute to this tragedy and mention the city of Natchez. in Industrial companies were located in Natchez in the 1960s, bringing jobs that were important to the city. Among them was Armstrong Tire and Rubber company. Such companies tended to repeat the pattern of segregation, keeping African Americans confined to lower level jobs. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) encouraged them to end such restrictions. Civil Rights Era Natchez City Hall on South Pearl Street In the early 1960s, as the civil rights movement gained some successes and James Meredith was admitted as the first black to the University of Mississippi, Natchez was the center of Ku Klux Klan activity opposing integration and the movement. E. L. McDaniel, the Grand Dragon of the United Klans of America, the largest Klan organization in 1965, had his office in Natchez at 114 Main Street. In August 1964, McDaniel established a klavern of the UKA in Natchez, operating under the cover name of the Adams County Civic and Betterment Association. Despite the violence, Forrest A. Johnson, Sr., a well-respected white attorney in Natchez, began to speak out and write against the Klan. From 1964 through 1965, he published an alternative newspaper called the Miss-Lou Observer, in which he weekly took on the Klan. Klansmen and their supporters conducted an economic boycott against his law practice, nearly ruining him financially.Donna Ladd, \\"Evolution of A Man: Lifting The Hood In South Mississippi\\", Jackson Free Press, 26 October 2005, accessed 15 October 2011 In his October 1964 report, A.E. Hopkins, an investigator for the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, a tax-supported organization that sponsored surveillance of residents, wrote that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was in Adams County in force > because of the alleged burning of several churches in that area as well as > several bombings and the whipping of several Negroes; also, because of the > murder of two Negroes from Meadville whose bodies were recovered from the > Mississippi river while the murders of three civil rights workers from > Philadelphia was being investigated by Federal, State and local > officials.Note: Hopkins was referring to the murders of the 19-year-old > black men Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charles Henry Moore of Franklin County, > Mississippi. By that time, more than 100 FBI agents were in the area as part of the Philadelphia investigation; three civil rights workers had disappeared and that summer were found murdered and buried in an earthen dam. The FBI was also trying to keep racial violence under control. Bill Williams, an FBI agent in Natchez for two years during that time, said in a 2005 interview that the \\"race wars in the area are 'a story never told.' He said that Natchez in 1964 had become the 'focal point for racial, anti-civil rights activity for the state for the next several years'.\\" Murders of four other African-American men in this area in 1964 are attributed to Klan members.\\"Cold Case: After 50 years, DOJ says it’s uncertain who killed Frank Morris; closes case\\", Concordia Sentinel, 5 February 2014, accessed 11 January 2015 Other Klan murders of activists followed in succeeding years, despite or in resistance to Congressional passage of civil rights legislation. As Klan violence rose in the 1960s, African Americans organized an armed paramilitary group called the Deacons for Defense and Justice, borrowing from a Louisiana group. They began to accompany NAACP officers and protesters, and carried weapons openly under Mississippi law. George Metcalf and Wharlest Jackson Sr. both worked for the Armstrong Tire and Rubber Plant, where they tried to open more positions to African Americans. They were both active in the Natchez chapter of the NAACP: Metcalf as president and Jackson as treasurer. On February 27, 1967, Jackson was killed when a car bomb went off in his truck as he drove home from work. He had recently received a raise and promotion to a position previously \\"reserved\\" for whites. A Korean War veteran, he was married with five children. His murder was never solved, and no one has been charged in the crime.Donna Ladd, \\"Daddy, Get Up: This Son of Natchez Wants Justice, Too\\", Jackson Free Press, 26 October 2005, accessed 16 October 2011 In August 1967, Metcalf submitted a petition in favor of school integration to the school board. (The Supreme Court had ruled segregated public schools as unconstitutional in 1954.) He asked the board not to publish the names of signatories to the petition, but they released the list. Little more than a week later, Metcalf was seriously injured in a car bombing. It was never solved.Adams County Key People: George Metcalf and Wharlest Jackson, Mississippi Civil Rights Project In response to these attacks, the Natchez Deacons for Defense stepped up their visible presence. All the men were already members of the NAACP and well known to each other. They maintained secrecy about the group, evading investigation by the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission and others. This group was important in the community; its members and numbers were kept secret, but they created a defense and warning against violent attacks of blacks. In addition to protecting activists, the Deacons helped enforce initiatives of the civil rights movement, such as a commercial boycott of white-owned stores in a successful effort to win concessions in integration from retailers and the city. Chapters of the Deacons were organized in other Mississippi areas. In 1966, the House Un-American Activities Committee published the names of Natchez residents who were current or former members of the Klan, including more than 70 employees at the International Paper plant in the city, as well as members of the Natchez police and the Adams County Sheriff's departments. HUAC found that at least four white supremacist terrorist groups were operating in Natchez during the 1960s, including the Mississippi White Caps. The MWC distributed flyers anonymously around the city, threatening \\"crooks and mongrelizers.\\" The Americans for the Preservation of the White Race was founded in May 1963 by nine residents of Natchez. The Cottonmouth Moccasin Gang was founded by Claude Fuller and Natchez Klansmen Ernest Avants and James Lloyd Jones. In June 1966, they murdered Natchez resident Ben Chester White, reportedly as part of a plot to draw Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Natchez in order to assassinate him. The three Klansmen were arrested and charged by the state with the murder. In each case, despite overwhelming evidence and, in Jones' case, a confession, either the charges were dismissed or the defendants were acquitted by all-white juries. (available on Google books) Blacks had been excluded from juries for decades as they had been disenfranchised since 1890 by a new state constitution and unable to vote. By 1966 the Voting Rights Act had been passed, but courts used other means to exclude them from juries; while many blacks were still registering to vote. =Prosecution of civil rights cold cases= James Ford Seale, one of two men arrested in November 1964 as a suspect in the kidnapping and murders of Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charles Henry Moore, was released when the state district attorney decided evidence was insufficient. Interest in the case was revived after 2000, when FBI files from 1964 were recovered by journalists. The FBI re-opened the investigation. Seale was arrested and charged by the US Attorney. He was tried and convicted in federal court in 2007. He died in federal prison in 2011 at the age of 76. The FBI discovered that 67-year-old Ben Chester White, murdered in June 1966, had been killed on federal land near Pretty Creek in the Homochitto National Forest of Natchez. As a result, they could establish federal jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute this case. In 1999, the case was reopened.Kevin Cooper, \\"White was an unlikely Klan target\\", Natchez Democrat, 5 December 1999, accessed 16 October 2011 Authorities indicted Ernest Avants in 2000 for the murder. He was convicted in 2003 and sentenced to life in prison; he died the following year at the age of seventy-two.\\"Ben Chester White\\" , Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Project, Northeastern University, 2011, accessed 16 October 2011 In February 2011, The Injustice Files of the Investigation Discovery channel aired three TV episodes of cold case murders related to the civil rights era. The first episode was devoted to the murder of Wharlest Jackson Sr., killed in 1967, as noted above. This was part of a collaboration with the FBI, which had started an initiative in 2007 to investigate and prosecute civil rights cases.Felicia R. Lee, \\"TV Series Tries to Revive Civil Rights Cold Cases\\", New York Times, 15 February 2011, accessed 16 October 2011 Natural disasters On May 7, 1840, an intense tornado struck Natchez, killing 269 people, most of whom were on flatboats in the Mississippi River. The tornado killed 317 persons in all, making it the second-deadliest tornado in United States history. In August 2005, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Natchez served as a refuge for coastal Mississippi and Louisiana residents, providing shelters, hotel rooms, rentals, Federal Emergency Management Agency disbursements and animal shelters. Natchez was able to keep fuel supplies open for the duration of the disaster, provide essential power to the most affected areas, receive food deliveries, and maintain law and order while assisting visitors from other areas. Many churches, including Parkway Baptist Church, were used as emergency shelters. In the months after the hurricane, a majority of the available homes were purchased or rented, with some tenants making Natchez their permanent home. Flooding in 2011 drove the Mississippi River to crest at on May 19, the highest recorded height of the river since the 1930s. Images and memory Prominent families in Natchez have used the Natchez Pilgrimage, an annual tour of the antebellum mansions, to portray a nostalgic vision of its antebellum slaveholding society. Since the Civil Rights Movement, however, this version has been increasingly challenged by blacks who have sought to add the black experience in Natchez to its public history.Jack E Davis, \\"A Struggle for Public History: Black and White Claims to Natchez's Past,\\" Public Historian, Jan 2000, Vol. 22 Issue 1, pp 45–63 According to the author Paul Hendrickson, \\"Blacks are not a part of the Natchez Pilgrimage.\\" Courthouse for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi at 101 South Pearl Street Natchez Museum of African American History and Culture at 301 Main Street By the winter of 1988, the National Park Service established Natchez National Historical Park around Melrose mansion. The William Johnson House in the city was added a few years later. The tours given by the N.P.S. tend to present a more complex view of the past. The historic district has been used by Hollywood as the backdrop for feature films set in the antebellum period. Disney's The Adventures of Huck Finn was partially filmed here in 1993. The 1982 television movie Rascals and Robbers: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn was also filmed here. The television mini-series Beulah Land was filmed in Natchez, as well a number of individual weekly shows of the TV drama The Mississippi, starring Ralph Waite. Parts of the television mini- series North and South were filmed in Natchez and neighboring Washington. Also, John Wayne's The Horse Soldiers was filmed in and around Natchez. In 2007, a United States Courthouse was opened, after renovating a historic hall for changed use. Part of the old hall had a Jim Crow-era monument to the local men and women from Natchez and Adams County who served in World War I. The 1924 monument was the subject of several stories in the Natchez Democrat, as reporters noted it lacked representation of black Army troops who had served in the war. A 2010 article suggested updating the monument to reflect all the local troops, and retiring the old monument.\\"Names to be added to war plaques\\", Natchez Democrat, 4 November 2010 On November 10, 2011, new plaques were installed that include the names of 592 African-American soldiers and 107 white soldiers, none of whom had been listed on the old plaques., Natchez Democrat, 11 November 2011 A cinema verité account of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement in Natchez was depicted by the filmmaker Ed Pincus in his film Black Natchez (2010). The film highlights organizing of the black community in 1965–1967. A black leader has been car-bombed and a struggle ensues in the black community for control. A group of black men organize a chapter of the Deacons for Defense. The community splits between more conservative and activist elements.See \\"Ed Pincus’s Black Natchez (1967),\\" F.I.L.M. 2010, Hamilton University Film Series A Museum of African American History and Culture has been opened in Natchez.

Philipsen's research treats communicative acts as occurring within cultural, social and small group settings. He is most noted for developing speech code theory a framework for communication in a given speech community. Speech code theory explores the manner in which groups communicate based on societal, cultural, gender, occupational or other factors. Philipsen received recognition for his lifetime achievement from the National Communication Association. Philipsen was born in Portland, Oregon in 1944.  Academic work  Philipsen earned a Bachelor of Arts in Social Science and in Speech from the University of Denver in 1967. In 1972, he went on to graduate with a Ph.D. in Communication Studies from Northwestern University. Following graduation he joined the faculty of University of California, Santa Barbara, where he taught from 1972 until 1978. In 1978, Philipsen joined the University of Washington. He remained at the University of Washington until his retirement in 2013. Awards and recognition While a member of the faculty at the University of Washington he was awarded: * 1984 Distinguished Teaching Award (University of Washington) * 2000 Faculty Distinguished Contribution to Lifelong Learning (The 1st of this award) (University of Washington) * 2013 Distinguished Scholar Award (National Communication Association)  Meant to honor those in the study of human communication for their lifetime achievements. Other honors: * 2008 Carroll C. Arnold Distinguished Lecture (National Communication Association) * 2013 To honor Philipsen, the University of Washington created the Gerry Philipsen Debate Forum.  Speech code theory  Before speech codes theory got its name Philipsen first referred to this theory as the Ethnography of Communication. He decided to change it because he recognized that many people could not get past the idea of Ethnography as simply a research method.[7] He was considered a naturalist who watched, listened and recorded communicative conduct in a cultures natural setting. Em Griffin[1] stated that, \\"Many people can't get past the idea of ethnography as simply a research method.\\" With that being said, Philipsen moved from description to explanation, resulting in him labeling his work \\"speech codes theory\\". Philipsen's ultimate goal was to develop a theory that would capture the relationship between communication and culture. \\"The Speech Codes theory was created for ultimately two purposes. The first was to distill some of what might be learned from a large body of fieldwork research on culturally distinctive ways of speaking. The second was to provide a focus for further research and discussion. The theory was first published in prototypical form with an introduction to the concept of speech codes and a presentation of four empirically grounded principles about speech codes. It was presented as a formal theoretical statements with five empirical grounded propositions, four of which were carried over intact from the earlier version.\\" (Philipsen, Coutu and Covarrubias).[3] There were four questions that Philipsen sought to answer through his research on the Speech Code Theory: # the existence of distinctive speech codes # the substance of the speech codes (whether they contained a vocabulary or way of speaking that held meanings for social constructs and worlds). # how speech codes could be observed and formulated. # the force of the speech code in social life. (Philipsen and Albrecht 119-156) [4] Works by Basil Bernstein heavily influenced Philipsen. Bernstein used the term \\"speech codes\\" in sociology and further elaborated on speech codes and their contexts. He stated that, \\"within the same society, there can exist different social groups or social classes whose communicative practices differ in important ways\\" (Philipsen, 1997). Bernstein argues that people have different ways of speaking, which shapes and reinforces their understanding of themselves, other people, and social life. Bernstein believes that a coding principle is, \\"a rule governing what to say and how to say it in a particular context.\\" [4]  References  Category:Educators from Portland, Oregon Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:University of Washington faculty Category:University of Denver alumni ","title":"Gerry Philipsen"},{"id":"51855161","text":"Landscape of alt= The Chinchorro culture of South America was a preceramic culture that lasted from 9,000 to 3,500 years BP (7,000 to 1,500 BCE). The people forming the Chinchorro culture were sedentary fishermen inhabiting the Pacific coastal region of current northern Chile and southern Peru. Presence of fresh water in the arid region on the coast facilitated human settlement in this area. The Chinchorro were famous for their detailed mummification and funerary practices. The area of the Chinchorro culture started to receive influences from the Andean Plateau around 4,000 BP, which led to the adoption of agriculture. Much later, it came under the influence of the Tiwanaku Empire.  Etymology  The Chinchorro culture is named after Chinchorro Beach (Spanish: Playa Chinchorro), near Arica, Chile, where the first mummies were discovered. Geography The culture was spread across the arid coastal regions of the Atacama Desert from Ilo, southern Peru, to Antofagasta in northern Chile. But the cultural core of the Chinchorro seems to be the Chilean Arica-Camarones region, which stretches between the coastal towns of Arica and Caleta Camarones to the south. There are many archaeological sites around Arica, and around Caleta Camarones.  Description  The Chinchorro were expert fishermen. They developed an extensive and sophisticated fishing tool assemblage. The people had efficient fishing gear, such as fishing hooks made of shells and cactuses, and stone weights for nets made of mesh fabrics. They became skilled weavers of baskets and mats.\\"Making the Dead Beautiful: Mummies as Art\\" Archaeology Magazine While most Chinchorro sites are located on the coast, some are also found inland and in the nearby highlands. Their lifestyle was predominantly supported by fish, shellfish and sea mammals. There are some large coastal middens that have been excavated. Analysis of the hair and human bones from the mummies indicates that about 90 percent of their diet existed of maritime food sources, with the remaining 10 percent of their food from terrestrial animals and plants.K. Kris Hirst, Chinchorro Culture – Introduction – archaeology.about.com The Chinchorro type site is located in Arica, Chile; it was discovered by German archaeologist Max Uhle in the early 20th century.Bernardo Arriaza, Chile’s Chinchorro Mummies nationalgeographic.com 1995 Many very early archaeological sites have been discovered along this coast. In Peru, Quebrada Tacahuay and Quebrada Jaguay have been studied by archaeologists. Further south, there are also the Ring site, and the Quebrada Los Burros. These mostly date to late Pleistocene and early Holocene epochs (ca. 11,000–9000 BC). Inland in Chile, there are also the sites of Achas, and Las Conchas, Chile. Quebrada Jaguay is the northernmost of these sites, and also the oldest, dated to 11,000 BC. Quebrada Tacahuay, further south, is somewhat younger. Some scholars argue that Chinchorro culture developed from these earlier settlements, although the details are still being investigated. The site of Achas is where the earliest Chinchorro mummy (the Acha man) has been found. The well known site of Monte Verde, which is also near the Chilean coastline, must also be mentioned in this context. Recently, Monte Verde has been re-dated to as early as 18,500 BP (16,500 B.C.).  Chinchorro mummies  alt= The Chinchorro mummies go back to 9,000 years Before Present, or 7,000 BC. The Chinchorro mummies were much older than those of the ancient Egyptians. Some of their DNA was recovered. The culture lasted for several thousand years, evolving and adapting over the period. The end of the Chinchorro culture is set around 3500 BP. Dr. Bernardo Arriaza is a Chilean physical anthropologist who contributed much to our current knowledge about the Chinchorro. In 1984, he published a study in the journal Chungara, his first work on the Chinchorro culture. Later, in 1994, Arriaza published a classification of the Chinchorro mummies, the typology that today is widely used by the scientific and general community. In 1995 he wrote an important article for National Geographic Magazine on the Chinchorro mummies, which was translated into several languages helping to promote the ancient mummies at international level. His book \\"Beyond Death: The Chinchorro Mummies of Ancient Chile\\" was published by the Smithsonian Institution Press in Washington, D.C. This work was later translated into Spanish by Marlene Onate (University of Nevada, Las Vegas) and published in Chile by the Universidad de Chile together with the Editorial Universitaria Press. Early tattoo A Chinchorro male mummy bares the earliest tattoo found in the Americas. He has a mustache-like dotted line tattooed above his upper lip; the tattoo dates to c. 2300 BC. Later developments The Azapa Phase of local cultural development (4,000‐2,500 BP) was a transitional period between the end of the Chinchorro Phase and the start of the Alto Ramírez Phase. These developments took place in the Azapa Valley near the coast. Around 4,000 BP, the people of the Azapa Valley saw some cultural changes brought by immigrants from the Altiplano. These influences led to the adoption of agriculture c. 3,000 BP, as well as the introduction of ceramics. These later groups no longer mummified their dead.Bianca Petruzzelli (2012), Stable Carbon and Nitrogen Isotopic Analysis of Skeletal Remains from Azapa 71 and Pica-8, Northern Chile: An Assessment of Human Diet and Landscape Use in the Late Holocene. M.A. Thesis, flinders.edu.au The influence of the early Andean cultures in northern Chile has been studied by several archaeologists. Especially the influence from the Wankarani culture, and the early Pukara culture from the Lake Titicaca area may be relevant here. During a transitional phase, the Chinchorros may have coexisted with an emergent Andean Tradition along the coast.Carlos A.

After a successful but costly start in the Soviet winter counteroffensive in the Tula region the division served on relatively quiet sectors into 1943, after which it joined the offensive push into German- occupied western Russia through the rest of that year, winning a battle honor for the liberation of Bryansk. In the course of the destruction of Army Group Center in the summer of 1944, the division further distinguished itself in the liberation of Bialystok in July. In 1945 the men and women of the 323rd took part in the Vistula-Oder Offensive through Poland and into Pomerania, and then finally in the Battle of Berlin, ending the war with distinction, but being disbanded soon after.  Formation  The 323rd Rifle Division began forming on August 1, 1941, in the Tambov Oblast of the Oryol Military District.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 78 Its primary order of battle was as follows: * 1086th Rifle Regiment * 1088th Rifle Regiment * 1090th Rifle Regiment * 892nd Artillery Regiment Col. Ivan Alekseevich Gartsev was appointed to command on the same day, and he would hold this post for more than two years, being promoted to Major General on November 17, 1942. The division was assigned to the 10th (Reserve) Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command in October.Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 75 =Battle of Moscow= 10th Army was deployed in the last week of November west of the Oka River, downstream from Kashira, to defend both Kolomna and Ryazan from the German 2nd Panzer Army.David Stahel, The Battle For Moscow, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2015, p. 232 The division arrived in Spassk-Ryazansky on November 29. It was noted as being outfitted with its main types of weapons and could be committed into the fighting upon concentration, but still lacked some weapons and auto transport. By December 5 it had reached Troitsa. The following day 10th Army was subordinated to Western Front, just as the Red Army counteroffensive was beginning.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow, ed. & trans. R.W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, Kindle ed., part III, ch. 2 The 323rd went into action on December 6, attacking toward Mikhailov from the southeast from a line to the north of Slobodka; the German 29th and 10th Motorized Divisions had been identified in this area. On the morning of December 11, 10th Army's leading divisions, including the 323rd, were ordered to reach the line Uzlovaya station – Bogoroditsk – Kuzovka over the next 24 hours. On the 13th the division overcame resistance by units of 10th Motorized and 112th Infantry Division and occupied Yepifan. The offensive continued over the following days and the division's forward detachments reached Rzhavo on the 17th, while two of its rifle regiments had liberated Plavsk by the end of December 19.Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part IV, ch. 4 However, from December 17 – 19 the division lost 4,138 officers and men, with 1,200 missing, the remainder being killed, wounded or sick. Only 70 of these were sick or frostbitten, demonstrating that they were at least well dressed for the conditions. Still, this was 40 percent losses in just 72 hours, and the division was a long time in recovering.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 75 The next stage of 10th Army's advance began on December 20, towards Belyov and Kozelsk; the depleted 323rd was moving into the area of Chastye Kolodezi. The Army's forces, along with 1st Guards Cavalry Corps, reached the Oka River north of Belyov on December 26 and the fight for the city began the next day, with the division in the second echelon.Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part IV, ch. 4 During the 27th the forward detachments of the 323rd were moving through Snykhovo towards the west; meanwhile Kozelsk was liberated by the cavalry. By the morning of the 29th the division was along the railroad 15-16km southeast of that town. On the last day of the year Belyov was freed by other elements of 10th Army; meanwhile the 323rd was moving to bypass the town of Sukhinichi from the south. Attempts by 324th and 239th Rifle Divisions to take this town from January 1–5, 1942, were unsuccessful.Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part V, ch. 5 On the latter date the 239th plus one battalion of the 323rd were left to blockade Sukhinichi while the rest of the division continued advancing to the area Polyaki-Buda – Monastyrskaya-Buda. From there it was to continue to Sloboda – Kotovichi – Zimnitsy. By the end of the day on January 9 the division had taken Lyudinovo and on the 10th continued fighting stubbornly to the west of that town. At this time 10th Army was encountering heavy snow and occasional blizzards which slowed the advance. The German forces also began to receive reinforcements from occupied France. The 323rd left a regiment in Lyudinovo and set out with its remaining forces towards Zhizdra on the night of January 15–16. The Germans launched a counterattack in the Lyudinovo area on the 18th and soon reoccupied the place, while also trying to relieve its besieged troops in Sukhinichi; the division fell back to the area Shipilovka – Usovka – Ignatovka. Part of the Sukhinichi garrison was extracted by the German relief force and the town was finally liberated on January 29. Fighting by both sides persisted into February with mixed success.Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part V, ch. 8  Into Western Russia and Belarus  The division was next assigned to the 16th Army of Western Front, but from April, 1942 until February, 1943 it was back in 10th Army, holding the southern flank of the same Front.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 76 During February it returned to 16th Army, where it would remain until April. It was then withdrawn to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for rebuilding over several months.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 61, 84, 122 General Gartsev left his command on August 13 and was very briefly replaced by two colonels in succession, before Col. Sergei Fyodorovich Ukranetz took over on August 18. By September 1 the division had been reassigned to the 25th Rifle Corps of 11th Army in Bryansk Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 248 On September 17, 1943, the city of Bryansk was liberated by Soviet forces, and the 323rd was given the name of this city as an honorific: =Gomel-Rechitsa Offensive= On October 10, Bryansk Front was disbanded, and 11th Army was moved to Belorussian Front. Over the next four weeks this Front's forces advanced towards the Dniepr River, and by November 9 the 11th Army had reached the line of the Sozh just north of the city of Gomel. The Front commander, Army General K.K. Rokossovski, determined its next move would be to liberate that city and the nearby town of Rechitsa on the Dniepr. By this time the 343rd had been reassigned to 53rd Rifle Corps, and this was to make the Army's main attack across the Sozh to encircle Gomel from the north, with the division on the north (right) flank. 11th Army faced the 134th and 299th Infantry Divisions of the German XXXV Army Corps.This was to prove a tall order. The well-supported offensive began on November 12 and the Corps attacked German positions between Raduga and Kirpichni Factories but ran into very stiff resistance. The 323rd and 96th Rifle Divisions fought for three days to secure the village of Khalch, backed by the guns of 22nd Artillery Division. Khalch taken, the 217th Rifle Division of 25th Corps forced a crossing of the Sozh, and a general assault began on November 16. On the next day both the 96th and 323rd focused on seizing the village of Raduga, while the 217th headed for the eastern defenses of Gomel. The painful advance continued over the next several days, but German resistance finally began to flag by November 23. Soviet successes to the north and south, including the liberation of Rechitsa, forced German 9th Army to begin falling back to the Dniepr, and Gomel finally fell on November 26.David M. Glantz, Battle For Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 172–77, 192–93 =Operation Bagration= Colonel Ukranetz was succeeded by Col. Abram Mikhailovich Cheryak on December 14. In early 1944, still in Belorussian Front, the division was assigned to 35th Rifle Corps in 63rd Army. On February 18, 63rd Army was dissolved, and 35th Rifle Corps was reassigned to 3rd ArmySharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 76 On May 24, Colonel Cheryak handed his command to Maj. Gen. Vasily Timoveevich Maslov; Maslov would remain in this post for the duration of the war. At the outset of Operation Bagration, on June 23, 35th Corps, under command of Maj. Gen. V. G. Zholudev, formed one of the two assault corps of 3rd Army, packed into less than ten kilometres of front opposite the northern half of the sector held by the German 134th Infantry Division. On the second day of the offensive, at 0400 hours, the assault force unleashed a massive 2-hour bombardment on the defenders in the Rogachev area, but by 0800 only the first line of German trenches had been taken, as bad weather had scrubbed the planned air support. As the weather cleared towards evening, further lines were taken, and the 9th Tank Corps prepared to exploit a breakthrough. Northwest of Bobruysk on June 26, the tankers cut the road to Mogilev behind the German XXXV Corps, with 35th and 41st Rifle Corps close behind and the 134th Infantry shattered and in flight. On the following day Bobruysk was surrounded, along with most of German 9th Army.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp. 185, 189, 195, 197 On July 21, the division's commander, General Maslov, was involved in an unfortunate incident involving two of his senior commanders, General Zholudev of 35th Corps and Lt. Gen. A.V. Gorbatov, commander of 3rd Army. Zholudev and Maslov were escorting Gorbatov, along with a number of other officers and men, to a new observation post that the 323rd had established. There was no clear route for the two light vehicles, and it became apparent that Maslov had lost his way. Gorbatov soon sensed the presence of the enemy, and ordered the vehicles to halt, at which time they came under fire from about 200 metres away. As the group attempted to escape, Zholudev was mortally wounded by German artillery fire.Aleksander A. Maslov, Fallen Soviet Generals, ed. and trans. by D.M. Glantz, Frank Cass Publishers, London, 1998, pp. 147–49, 203–04 Into Poland and Germany At about this time, 3rd Army was transferred to the 2nd Belorussian Front. On July 27, the 323rd played a leading role in the liberation of the city of Bialystok, for which it was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on August 9 for \\"exemplary fulfillment of command tasks\\" and its \\"valor and courage\\". In September the division was transferred to the 38th Rifle Corps in the 33rd Army, under which commands it would serve for the duration. 33rd Army was assigned to 1st Belorussian Front in October, and the 323rd went on to participate in the Vistula-Oder Offensive, the Pomeranian Offensive, and the Battle of Berlin as part of this Front.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 76  Postwar  The soldiers of the 323rd ended the war with the official title of 323rd Rifle, Bryansk, Order of the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov Division.

Literary critic Roger Shattuck explains, \\"During a récit, we are conscious of being at one remove from the action; the very act of narration interferes and calls attention to itself.\\" Examples of the récit include works by Benjamin Constant and Eugene Fromentin, André Gide, Maurice Blanchot, and Michel Leiris. According to Shattuck, > The discomfort of the narrator in confronting his own effort of composition > (by now it should be apparent that narrator and author become > indistinguishable) has been inherited as one of the principal features of > the recit. Critic Geoffrey Hartman describes the récit as \\"a confessional narrative, a kind of dramatic monologue in prose . ... \\" Daniel Just writes of an ambiguity in the nature of the récit: > For literary critics, the récit as a category became ... elusive—at once too > broad and too specific. Meaning a \\"narrative\\" in general, récit has been > used as an indefinite notion embracing many prose genres, to the point when > it ceases to be clear if it does not coincide with narrative literature as > such.

For four years, Brickell lived among the Lenape tribe. Brickell was released as a result of the Treaty of Greenville in August 1795. A monument in Columbus, Ohio marks the location of Brickell's cabin.  Abduction and captivity  In February 1791, Brickell was alone clearing out a fencerow near his brother's home in Ohio when a member of the local Lenape tribe approached Brickell with a rifle. The man took Brickell by his hand and drove him towards Tuscarawas. Brickell did not resist. Brickell eventually suspected something was wrong and attempted to break free from the man's watch, however, the man caught Brickell before he could escape and threw him to the ground. The Native American man tied both of Brickell's hands together behind his back, and they continued walking. After traveling a short distance, they found a man named George Girty, who had also been abducted by the Lenape Indians. Girty, who spoke English, told Brickell, \\"White people have killed Indians, and the Indians retaliated, and now there is war, and you are a prisoner; and we will take you to our town and make an Indian of you. You will not be killed if you go peaceably, but if you try to run away, we won't be troubled with you. We will kill you and take your scalp to our town.\\" Brickell went with Girty peacefully, thus beginning his captive life with the Lenape. Brickell lived with the natives for four years until the Treaty of Greensville secured his release in 1795.  Legacy  In 1797, Brickell returned to Ohio, and became an early settler of Columbus, Ohio. He resided there until his death on July 20, 1844, at age 64. A monument in Columbus, Ohio marks the location of Brickell's cabin.

Her novels often dealt with girls in difficult circumstances: coping with a mother's alcoholism (Jennifer), with the remarriage of a parent (Almost April and The Girl in the Mirror), with an unexpected pregnancy (Too Bad About the Haines Girl), with guilt over a hit- and-run (Leslie). In her time slip story Why Have the Birds Stopped Singing? the stigma of epilepsy is added to the usual cultural disorientation, and in her paranormal tale The Girl Who Knew Tomorrow, the young psychic girl finds fame a mixed blessing. For Jennifer, she received the Children's Book Award for 1959.

Early life and career  In 1957, Porkolab emigrated from Hungary to Canada. He obtained his bachelor's degree at the University of British Columbia in 1963 and then his master's degree and Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1964 and 1967 respectively. He moved to the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, where he worked as a Senior Research Physicist until 1975. During the following year, Porkolab worked at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Garching, Germany, under the auspices of the Humboldt Foundation as a winner of the \\"US Senior Scientist Award\\". In 1977, he became Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he later led the Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC) for many years. Between 1991 and 2001, Porkolab served as Editor of Physics Letters A, in the Plasma Physics and Fluid Dynamics subsection. He also represented the U.S. Plasma Physics community for six years on the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) Commission–16 (Plasma Physics) (1991-1997). Between 1992 and 1995, he served as a member of the National Research Council Subpanel on Plasma Science. In 1999, he served as Chair of the Plasma Physics Division of the American Physical Society.  Scientific contributions Whilst at Princeton, Porkolab concentrated on dispersive properties of plasma waves and instabilities in magnetized plasmas. Measurements corroborating the validity of the collisionless Boltzmann equation and demonstrating nonlinear scattering of Bernstein waves with wavelengths comparable to the electron Larmor radius were obtained. Porkolab's work provided experimental verifications of Landau damping, nonlinear resonant wave-wave scattering and parametric instabilities, also predicting upper hybrid solitons. From 1977, whilst at the MIT Physics Department, Porkolab joined the newly established MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center, where he began experiments on lower hybrid current drive in tokamak plasmas. He also carried out investigations on ion cyclotron heating and mode conversion processes in multi-ion species fusion plasmas. Phase-contrast imaging (PCI) was developed by Porkolab's group both for use at the Alcator C-Mod tokamak and the DIII-D tokamak of General Atomics in San Diego. In recent years, PCI measurements contributed to the advanced in understanding of turbulence and Alfvén wave phenomena.  Honors and awards  For his work on radio frequency heating and noninductive current drive on the Versator II, the Alcator C and C-Mod tokamaks, Professor Porkolab shared the 1984 American Physical Society Excellence in Plasma Research Award (now the John Dawson Award).

It tackled issues such as epidemics, tuberculosis, and development of sanitation systems, including initiating the construction of the systems sewer system. Between 1889 and 1902, its scope included Arapahoe County. Then, it returned to an organization focused on the city and county of Denver. Denver Medical Association In April 1871 the Denver Medical Association was founded. The Denver Medical Association created the public health system for Denver, Colorado to improve the health of its citizens. Its goals were to \\"raise the standard of the profession\\" and \\"encourage better medical education\\". In 1871 the Dr. Henry King Steele led an initiative to establish a state medical society. The Territorial Medical Society was established on September 19, 1871 when physicians from across the territory attended a meeting in a Denver district courtroom. It became the Colorado State Medical Society in 1876. A key public health risk was the spread of syphilis. Dr. Frederick J. Bancroft, the Denver city physician, estimated in 1872 that due to the prevalence of prostitution, \\"probably every third man who reaches the age of twenty-five has acquired . . . syphilis\\" from the brothels in the city. Bancroft, with the Denver Medical Association, advocated licensing, stipulation of allowed services, and testing and examinations of the city's prostitutes. The proposed program was to be managed by physicians and police. The city decided instead to outlaw prostitution and fine prostitutes. In 1875, the Denver Medical Association's physicians decided that management of prostitutes was a solely a police matter. Bancroft continued to advocate a licensing system, as well as making abortion an attempted murder crime. Denver, though, was not ready to relinquish its \\"sex- drugs-and-gambling lifestyle\\" from the gold rush days. In the 1870s, tuberculosis became more prevalent in the city. Bancroft noted in a March 1873 report to the city council that, of tuberculosis deaths that he reported, 75 of 79 were ill before they sought treatment in Colorado. He had also noted in the 1870s that Denver's citizens had injuries or illnesses due to livestock being driven through and penned on the city streets, sewage and other debris on the city streets, and outhouses placed too close to wells. He stated in a couple of annual reports that the contamination is a significant public health issue and could result in typhus and tuberculosis epidemic, he cautioned the city council. Although there were earlier attempts, it was not until 1880 that Denver began construction of a sewer system. By that point there had been a flood on May 22, 1878 of Cherry Creek, which was then contaminated with animal remains and other material. Then, an epidemic ensued in 1879. John W. Graham, then, became the city's physician and soon after ordered the immediate construction of a sewer. Due to public health concerns, the association asked the Denver city council to forbid cattle running throughout the city streets in 1879. The first women members—Drs. Mary Barker Bates, Alisa Avery, and Edith Root—joined in 1881. Denver and Arapahoe counties The organization was broadened in scoped when it became the Denver Medical Association and Arapahoe County Medical Society in 1889. Its name was shortened three years later to Denver and Arapahoe Medical Society. It separated from Arapahoe County in November 1902.

He is the co-founder, president, and CEO of Extreme Music, which creates and licenses music for use in television, film, advertising, and online media, and the president and CEO of Bleeding Fingers Custom Music Shop, a scoring, composition,and music production company co-founded with Hans Zimmer and Steve Kofsky. Early life Emanuel was born in London to Maureen Emanuel and Edward Potok, a Polish survivor of World War II. He grew up in a working-class neighborhood in North London, and began to play the guitar when he was a child. As a teenager, Emanuel played in bands and bought his first electric guitar with money earned from a paper route. He left high school at 15 and remained in London, where he became involved in the English punk scene of the late 1970s. Career After leaving secondary school, Emanuel got a job in the mailroom at the BBC. Later, he was a studio assistant at MCA Music Publishing as well as a tape operator and eventually a sound engineer at studios including Abbey Road. During the same time period, he played bass in a punk band, Class Ties, who released an album on EMI in 1981. In the mid-80s, he began to manage bands including The Jam and Stiff Little Fingers, with whom he co-wrote several songs, produced and engineered. Emanuel was introduced to production music when he was hired by Bruton Music, a production music library. Although he worked in the mailroom, he and a friend, Warren Bennett, were asked to record an album for the library. Bennett's father, Brian Bennett who had played with The Shadows and Cliff Richard, served as the album's producer. Commenting on the aesthetic of production music of the time, Emanuel said: \\"Bruton was one of the first production music libraries, and it was all on vinyl back then, and with a few exceptions tended to be full of people knocking out soundalikes of current hits. They'd change the chord structure round a bit and that would be it.\\" Over the next fifteen years, Emanuel and Bennett received royalty payments for the Bruton soundalike album. Emanuel was subsequently hired by MatchMusic, a small music library, and began to compose production music with SLF drummer Dolph Taylor. In addition to writing while on tour with portable equipment, Emanuel and Taylor wrote together in a small MIDI studio in Taylor's London flat. With significant success, Taylor joined the staff of Match Music, and ultimately he and Emanuel ran the company. Rather than writing and recording the \\"traditional old-school emulations,\\" Emanuel and Taylor approached commercial artists, many of whom they already knew, to create tracks with high production values. They subsequently developed the \\"Extreme Music\\" series for Match, creating production music by established artists. In 1997, when MatchMusic was sold to BMG, Emanuel and Taylor decided to found their own library, naming the company Extreme Music. It was pitched as a \\"production music company that would up the industry ante by using professional recording equipment and top-notch musicians\\" and financed through a $100,000 investment from Mark Levinson, a previous owner of Palan Music, Extreme Music was positioned to reflect the punk rock ethos of its founders; for example, they mailed condoms to 1000 music industry executives with packaging that read \\"Extreme Music: The Only Safe Thing You'll Ever Get From Us.\\" With a focus on production, they intentionally limited the size of the catalogue, \\"upping the industry ante by using professional recording studios and top-notch musicians.\\" Through keeping the library's emphasis on quality over quantity, they streamlined the process of selecting music for advertising agencies and music supervisors, eventually building one of the most profitable production music libraries in the UK. In August 2005 it was bought by Viacom for $45.1 million, and in 2008 it was acquired by Sony/ATV Music Publishing. The terms of the sale were not disclosed. Extreme Music remains based in London. In 2005 it expanded to include a production facility in Santa Monica, California. Additional offices were opened globally, and as of 2016, Extreme had built a library which contained approximately 15,000 original copyrights. Noting its size and the impact of using only high- quality music in the library, Emanuel said: “We’re very surgical about what we put in the catalog,” he says. “Our biggest competition, who we outperform, have a million copyrights.” In August 2013, Extreme partnered with composer Hans Zimmer and his business partner, Steve Kofsky, to found Bleeding Fingers Custom Music Shop, a joint venture. It focuses on creating original music for use in light television drama, documentaries, animated features, reality television and film scores. Emanuel serves as the company's president and CEO. In 2017, Emanuel produced the track \\"Ocean (Bloom)\\" (stylized \\"ocean (bloom)\\"), a Zimmer and Radiohead collaboration for the BBC's Blue Planet II.

During these years Martin played a key role in developing federal special education policy, drafting and advising the Congress on multiple pieces of legislation.Congressional Record, Vol.117, No 69, May 12, 1971 In 1975, he was one of a small group of hill staff members and advocates for children who drafted what became P.L. 94-142, the Education of All Handicapped Children Act, a landmark bill in which states promised to educate all their handicapped children to qualify for federal funding for such programming. In 1990, the law became known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). President Carter appointed Martin to serve as the nation's first Assistant Secretary of Education for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, to head the newly created Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS). He was confirmed unanimously by the Senate. He served in that role until he was succeeded by President Reagan's appointee, Jean S. Tufts, in October 1981. In 1981, Martin received the highest accolade of the Council for Exceptional Children, the J. E. Wallace Wallin Award for Lifetime Achievement. Later career Leaving the government in 1981, Martin became the President and CEO of three non-profit corporations serving children and adults with disabilities, The National Center for Disability Services on Long Island, New York. The Center has since been renamed The Viscardi Center. Martin's efforts won him invitations to become Lecturer in Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and Columbia University's Teachers College. After retiring, Martin ran for, and won, election for the office of Mayor of Venice, Florida. He served for one three-year term from 2007-2010. He currently writes a blog opposing increased land development in the area, Inside Venice, Florida. Martin remains an individual of strong influence in special education. He wrote an email to professional friends July 29, 2017: 'Perspectives on Providing Special Education to Children' I have had the good and interesting fortune to have taught preschool school, school-aged, and Post-secondary students with special education needs, including some graduate students and faculty members. In association with other professionals I have worked, learned and taught with physicians, psychologists, social workers, speech pathologists and audiologists, some with disabilities, e.g., deafness, blindness, mental health, physical disabilities, ranging in extent of disability from mild to severe. I am sharing my thoughts, particularly with those who feel only regular classroom placement is the ideal service delivery system, not because I think I have \\"the answer,\\" but in hopes that by sharing, we might communicate with additional appreciation of differing views. There is no way, it seems to me, one can follow the path, I have, without being struck by the unique characteristics, strengths and weaknesses, and the unique needs of individuals. There are, of course, commonalities, but in the learning/therapy interaction, I found no one-fits-all model. I have worked with individuals, small groups, and larger groups of a dozen or more, trying to achieve differing kinds of growth. Early in my career I worked with adult individuals who had suffered loss of speech and language from stroke, gun shot, accident, etc. The embraced model of treatment, was one-on-one instruction with an emphasis on the physical formation of sounds and words. It was called, in those days, \\"The Medical Model.\\" My great teacher/mentor, Ollie Backus, began working with groups at the University of Michigan and then at the University of Alabama. With her support, I began having small groups, two or three usually participate in role playing of simple daily events, purchasing cigarettes or coffee, etc. using whatever speech or gestures came out, not attempting speech drills. We, clients and staff, were pleased with the results. The interpersonal context eliciting speech, not always accurate, but there was another gain, the clients felt less hopeless, they began to feel they could get by. Working with others with similar, but unique, problems created a positive environment for learning. That learning experience and others, with children and adults with a variety of physical, mental, emotional, sensory and neurological abilities and disabilities, informed my teaching and administrative duties in a variety of professional roles, including administering the federal government's programs for initiating, expanding and improving special education and related services for the nation's children with disabilities. Today, I read with interest the impassioned arguments about a Continuum of Education Placements model and the Inclusion Model, (with various titles and small variations.). I have friends and former colleagues, including parents, who fall along a \\"Continuum of Beliefs.\\" I know them to be caring persons. I also know that others, as long as there have been special education programs, have wanted to find less expensive ways to meet requirements. This is not a new phenomenon, nor is it rare. HELPING DRAFT FEDERAL SPECIAL ED LAW Starting in 1966, as Director of the House Subcommittee on the Handicapped, and continuing until I resigned in 1981, I was part of shaping about one dozen federal laws, from the first EHA, Title VI of ESEA, to PL 94-142 and its implementing regulations which were drafted by the Bureau of Education for the Handicapped, when I was its director. BEH was staffed by special educators, those from related professions and by persons with disabilities as well as family members. Its collective experience was national and even international in scope, and covered decades of special educational practice. In addition to our own experience we used dozens of professional experts and parents as consultants, field reviewers of proposals for grants, advisory committee members and more. Our relationships with CEC, NARC-ARC, NASDSE, TASH, AFT, NEA, PARENTS COALITIONS, NASB, and more expert organizations/affected parties was ongoing and deliberately sought and expanded. It is from this collective intelligence, as well as from Court decisions and agreements, such as PARC and MILLS, that federal law was built and implemented. Civil Rights provisions joined educational best practice to demand States and school districts, individualize instruction, involve parents, find children needing help, and move away from unnecessarily separated schools and classes, i.e. \\"Educate children with non-disabled children wherever appropriate.\\" Free, Appropriate, Public Education, (FAPE) became the central concept of the law. Having experienced segregated schools and also having seen most children sitting, essentially idly in regular classes, this collective wisdom believed that children should have options, providing various intensities of specially designed instruction by expert special education teachers and supporting therapists. POST GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCES Because of the Bureau's programs and policies, essentially promoting what was then called, \\"Mainstreaming\\" along a continuum of placements, some colleagues were surprised, and some even disappointed that I chose to become CEO of a complex of three non-profit corporations serving children and adults with disabilities, including a school, tuition-free, for children with physical disabilities. My goals in taking the job included: building Post-secondary and vocational opportunities for young adults, helping them transition into productive employment and/or Post-secondary educations; developing a research and demonstration program that would develop new approaches to those tasks; improve preschool programming by bringing expert consultants in to revise current practices, and examine models of Education for children in the school, consistent with PL 94-142. As I studied the school I found that the education, paid for by the State of NY as a \\"state-supported school,\\" was highly successful in academic terms, more students earned Regent and Non-Regent diplomas than did non-disabled students in the same area. I looked further, asking parents and students to tell me of their educational experiences before attending this school and while enrolled. I found this special placement was highly valued, particularly the social opportunities the elementary and secondary schools provided. Students talked of isolation, of being different, unable to play sports, be in the theater, the student government, going to dances, dating, etc. Parents recounted stories of substandard programs, poor facilities, in-appropriate educational placements, essentially the stories all of us reading this know. Still, while I no longer considered closing the school I wanted to be sure no child was \\"sent\\" to this school, against their or their parents wishes, and we monitored placement decisions by local schools, boards, etc. I don't recall we found any placements without parent approval, but we monitored carefully. In addition we began to have discussions with students and parents about transitioning into local schools on a full or part- time basis. We also formed closer ties with our own vocational trainers and counselors and with local colleges, including ones where we were operating transition models. CONCLUSION I learned a great deal from this special school, that placements are appropriate—not if I or other educators think so, philosophically, but if the educational outcomes are positive and the students feel they are in a positive supporting environment, one where they are valued, and where they feel success. It is these experiences that make me cautious about the current one-size fits all passion. I recently saw a very attractive \\"inclusion class\\" in a film at a TASH meeting. I have no doubt that was a valuable learning experience for all involved. As filmed, the teacher was extraordinary, sensitive, intelligent and highly skilled. I have no doubt good work is possible in such a setting, as I saw the same kind of teachers in the school I described. I am aware, however, that not every teacher, in any setting, is well-trained and successful. I am aware that some children are getting less, not more specially designed instruction, using successful data-based instructional practices. We must improve teaching and learning. There is no magic bullet in \\"inclusion\\" or all special settings. We must avoid \\"throwing out the baby because the bath water is not as clear as we would wish.\\" References Bibliography * President Jimmy Carter wrote of this book, \\"For the current generation of special education scholars, this book provides a valuable report on serious challenges in meeting the needs of the disadvantaged, and provides examples of how noble efforts can be successful.\\" External links * The Viscardi Canter, formerly the National Center for Disability Services.

Navitas is owned by the research park INCUBA Science Park, the Aarhus University School of Engineering and the Aarhus School of Marine and Technical Engineering. The three institutions together operate a consortium that maintains the facilities and together they inhabit the building.  History  Navitas Park was built in response to a growing student population and the need to consolidate educational institutions. The Port of Aarhus has built large new facilities leaving the old industrial sites open for redevelopment. In the 2000s a contest was opened for bidding to establish new facilities for AU Engineering and the Aarhus School of Marine and Technical Engineering while providing additional space for INCUBA Science Park. In 2010 E. Pihl & Søn and architect firm Kjaer & Richter won the contest and in 2014 the building was completed.  Architecture  Navitas was built by the construction company E. Pihl & Søn by designs of the architecture firms Kjaer & Richter and Christensen & Co Arkitekter, landscape architect Marianne Levinsen and consultants ALECTIA. Rambøll functioned as the overall project manager, coordinating efforts between the different companies involved. Navitas Park is part of a wider effort to revitalize the former industrial port facilities of the Port of Aarhus. It overlooks the Bay of Aarhus from a prominent position on the harbor-front. The building is shaped like a star with four pointed wings, carried by columns at the ends. The building is in 8 floors and is clad in white and blue glass. The basement contains a public parking garage with 450 parking spots, operated by the city of Aarhus. The building was the largest low energy building in Denmark when it was constructed and feature a number of environmental solutions that gives it in the highest Danish house energy rating.

Ru ware bowl, with metal rim, British Museum. Group in the Percival David Collection. Ru ware, Ju ware, or \\"Ru official ware\\" () is a famous and extremely rare type of Chinese pottery from the Song dynasty, produced for the imperial court for a brief period around 1100. Fewer than 100 complete pieces survive, though there are later imitations which do not entirely match the originals. Most have a distinctive pale \\"duck-egg\\" blue glaze, \\"like the blue of the sky in a clearing amongst the clouds after rain\\" according to a medieval connoisseur,Sun (translation quoted); Sotheby's (2012). This description was also applied to the still rarer, and possibly mythical Chai ware of the 10th century, see Gompertz, 79–80 (and note 5); Rawson, 245 and are otherwise undecorated, though their colours vary and reach into a celadon green.Sun; Sotheby's (2012) The shapes include dishes, probably used as brush-washers, cups, wine bottles (carafes in modern terms), small vases, and censers and incense-burners. They can be considered as a particular form of celadon wares.Gompertz, 84; Vainker, 99; Sotheby's (2012); Sun Ru ware represents one of the Five Great Kilns identified by later Chinese writers. The wares were reserved for the Imperial court, with according to one contemporary source only those they rejected reaching a wider market. The source, Zhou Hui, also says the glaze contained agate, and when the kiln site was located in recent decades it was indeed very close to a site for mining agate, which is very largely composed of silica, a usual component of ceramic glazes. However, experts now discount any influence of agate in achieving the Ru glaze colour.Vainker, 100; Sotheby's (2012) The bluish colour may be due to dissolved iron oxide with a very low amount of titanium dioxide. Ru ware is perhaps the first \\"official ware\\" specifically commissioned by the imperial court. Their normal practice seems to have been to review the large quantities of \\"tributary ware\\" given to them by the provinces making ceramics, effectively as a form of tax. The court kept what they wanted and redistributed the remainder as part of their lavish gifts to officials, temples, and foreign rulers, and perhaps also selling some.Rawson, 242; but see Vainker, 93 Production ended when, or shortly before, the kilns were occupied by the invaders who overthrew the Northern Song dynasty in the 1120s, but the wares remained famous and highly sought after. On 3 October 2017, a Ru ware brush-washer dish, 13 cm (5 in) across, set a new record auction price for Chinese ceramics at Sotheby's Hong Kong, fetching HK$294.3 million, nearly US$28 million.\\"Chinese Ru-ware bowl sets $38m auction record in Hong Kong\\", BBC News; Sotheby's video of the piece, 1.11 mins; Sotheby's (2017); in US$ the 2014 price for a doucai \\"chicken cup\\" was slightly higher, but the sale was also in Hong Kong, and the HK$ price lower. Characteristics Cup stand, Victoria and Albert Museum.V&A; page Close-up of crackle in the glaze. The pieces are mostly fairly small, for drinking, use at a scholar's desk, incense burning, or as small containers. There are a few oval \\"narcissus vases\\", which is to say planters for daffodils. Many pieces have a subtle crazed or crackled glaze, though there is some evidence that the most admired are those without this, and the effect was not deliberate.Sotheby's (2012); Gompertz, 95 Those shapes that are not simple pottery forms show derivation from other media such as metalwork or lacquer, for example the bottomless cup-stand, which is a common shape in both.Medley, 122–123 Most shapes have a \\"clearly defined, slightly splayed foot-rim\\".Gompertz, 95, quoted; Medley, 122 A very few pieces have decoration, with a \\"lightly impressed floral design\\".Gompertz, 95 The glaze, applied in several layers,Vainker, 107 continues over the rims at top and bottom of the pieces, in contrast to the rival porcelain Ding ware, fired upturned and so with a rough unglazed rim, often covered with a band of metal. Instead Ru ware was kept off the kiln stack surface by being supported on three or five small spurs or prongs, presumably of metal, which left little unglazed oval spots called \\"sesame seeds\\" on the underside.Sotheby's (2012); Valenstein, 89; Medley, 122 The colours vary, and have been classified by Chinese authorities as \\"sky-blue\\", \\"pale-blue\\" and \\"egg-blue\\", in each case using the Chinese word qing, which can cover both blue and green.Gompertz, 95 This \\"all-over\\" glazing technique seems to have been invented at the Ru kilns, and increased the resemblance of the wares to jade,Sotheby's (2012) always the most prestigious material in Chinese art. Another element in this resemblance was the \\"thick unctuous glaze texture\\", which has been described as \\"like lard dissolving not flowing\\",Vainker, 99, quoted, then quoting The most admired type of jade was known as \\"mutton fat\\".Vainker, 99 Examination of excavated fragments shows the fired clay body is a light grey colour, sometimes compared to the colour of incense ash. Although stoneware by Western criteria (not a category recognised in traditional Chinese thinking),Sun calls them \\"porcelains\\"; Sotheby's (2012), the British Museum and others call them stoneware. the wares are fired at a relatively low temperature, and are far from fully vitrified, absorbing water at a \\"fairly high\\" rate. Nor is the body free from flaws when examined under magnification. Since it was almost entirely covered by glaze, these issues did not detract from the wares.Sun Some authorities note that the body might really be considered earthenware, though it is always classified by Western writers as stoneware,Medley, 122; Gompertz, 94 because of the other Northern Celadons it relates to, and in Chinese terms as \\"high-fired\\", usually translated as porcelain.as by Sun for example The 87 pieces listed by Regina Krahl in 2017 are set out by 20 different shapes. The most numerous of these is round brush-washer bowls (33), with all brush-washers totalling 38. There are 25 dishes and 5 bottles (or vases) of various shapes, 6 narcissus basins, with stands and other pieces making up the rest.Sotheby's (2017) Kiln site A group of over 15 kilns at the village of Qingliangsi, Baofeng County, Henan have been identified as the site manufacturing Ru ware. They were first identified in 1950,Sun and in 1977 the ceramic art historian Ye Zhemin found a sherd on the site which when analysed proved identical to a Ru ware sample in Beijing. This was confirmed as the site was excavated, beginning in 1987, with the main \\"official ware\\" kiln and workshop area being uncovered in 2000 in the sixth phase of excavation.Sun Altogether the site covers 250,000 square metres, \\"with kilns densely distributed throughout\\".Vainker, 100 As they were excavated it became clear that they had also produced large amounts of other, lesser wares, including black and three-colour wares, and also \\"a significant quantity of carved and incised Ru wares of inferior quality,\\"Vainker, 101 (quoted); British Museum which is not represented among surviving pieces. Apart from the last, these other styles would not normally be called \\"Ru ware\\", and fall within the range of other contemporary northern ceramics. The excavations also found sherds of \\"official\\" quality, but in more elaborate shapes than found among the surviving whole pieces. These may have been test pieces that were not put into production. There are also pieces decorated in conventional celadon techniques, also not found in the complete survivals.Sun; Sotheby's (2012) Dating Warming bowl in the shape of a flower with light bluish- green glaze, National Palace Museum. Three greenish bowls in the Shanghai Museum. This type is normally described as a brush-washer. Note the 5 \\"sesame- seed\\" marks on the upturned base. In 2012 a Sotheby's catalogue note said \\"Although the exact time of the production of Ru ware is still under debate, all scholars agree that it was made for an extremely short period only. Generally a space of some twenty years is proposed, from 1086 to 1106, although some scholars have argued for a slightly longer period.\\"Sotheby's (2012) Earlier Jessica Rawson thought the period was \\"c.1107 to 1125\\".Rawson, 366 Shelagh Vainker says the period was \\"about 40 years\\".Vainker, 99; Valenstein, 89 favours 20 years The British Museum says \\"twenty or perhaps forty years between 1086 and 1106 or 1125\\".British Museum, \\"bottle\\", 1978,0522.1 in expanded Curator's comments. It was only produced during the reigns of the Huizong Emperor (r. 1100–1125) and perhaps his predecessor, Zhezong (r. 1085–1100). Huizong seems to have taken a close personal interest in the ware.Rawson, 366; Vainker, 99 Shortly after Huizong abdicated the Northern Song period was ended by invaders from the north, and Huizong and his successor were captured in the disastrous Jin-Song wars of the 1120s. A younger son of Huizong fled to the south and established the Southern Song as the Gaozong Emperor (1127–1163), but the Ru kiln was now in enemy territory, and production of Ru ware ceased, if it had not already done so.Vainker, 99; Sotheby's (2012) The kilns were abandoned, and the workers dispersed.Sun A gift of 16 itemized pieces to Gaozong in 1151 is recorded;Sun; Vainker, 99 a rather tiny quantity by imperial standards, suggestive of their rarity. The same source records that when in 1179 the aged retired emperor visited a garden, a Ru vase was placed there for him to admire.Sun In the south a form of official Guan ware, more green than blue, seems to have acted as a rather inadequate substitute for the court.Rawson, 242; Sun The dates of production were long confused by a fake test disk in the Percival David Collection. This is a flat circular ring with an inscription claiming that it was the \\"first test piece\\", produced under the supervision of a \\"Vice-Minister of the Imperial Household\\" on 9 April 1107. Always regarded with great suspicion by many scholars, it is now generally agreed to be a fake, probably 20th- century.British Museum, PDF A41; Gompertz, 88–90 Collecting and imitation The wares seem to have been very rare even during the time they were produced, and remained so, as various Chinese writers say. The Qianlong Emperor (r. 1736–95), a keen collector who must have owned at least half of the surviving examples, describes it in a poem \\"as rare as stars at dawn\\". As they receded in time, their reputation became almost legendary, although many of the writers praising them may never have glimpsed examples.Gompertz, 92; Vainker, 99; Sotheby's (2012) However, after Guan ware there do not seem to have been serious attempts to imitate them in China until the 18th century, when under the Yongzheng Emperor (r. 1723–35) they were copied in imperial Jingdezhen ware, with examples from the imperial collection being sent to Jingdezhen to copy. These are known as \\"Ru-type\\" ware. The Qianlong Emperor wrote poems on several pieces – in both senses, as he had them engraved on the bases. One of these pieces was actually a recent imitation made for his father.Sotheby's (2012) A special favourite was a planter for daffodils without crackle, now in Taipei, where the undispersed holdings of the Imperial collection are today,Sotheby's (2012); two photos. illustrated above.The Emperor's poem inscribed on the underside. Imitation in Korean ceramics began shortly after Ru ware was produced, and Korean pieces were for long often confused with Chinese originals.Gompertz, 84, 93–94 Collections Two bowls in the Percival David Collection. In 2012, Sotheby's identified 79 individual complete survivals,Sotheby's (2012) and a revised list by Regina Krahl for their next Ru sale in 2017 increased this to 87;Sotheby's (2017) The National Palace Museum issued a list in 2015 totalling 90 pieces in various collections around the world, including some damaged in a fire in 1923; Krahl added and subtracted some pieces from this.Sotheby's (2017). Sun says there are \\"approximately 74 surviving\\" pieces There are now also many sherds found at the kiln site. The largest collections, per Sotheby's list, were: *21 pieces in the National Palace Museum, Taipei *17 in the British Museum, London (including the Percival David Collection) *15 in the Palace Museum, Beijing *8 in the Shanghai Museum *2 in the Röhsska Museum, Gothenburg, Sweden *with single pieces in the National Museum of China, Beijing; Tianjin Municipal Art Museum; Museum of Oriental Ceramics, Osaka; Hong Kong Museum of Art; Cleveland Museum of Art, Philadelphia Museum of Art; St. Louis Art Museum; Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. The number of pieces recognised has expanded considerably since the early 20th century, more as pieces in collections are identified than as unknown examples emerge. Gompertz gave a list totalling 31 pieces outside China in his first edition of 1958,Sotheby's (2012); Medley, 272 (note 11) – she says \\"a new list might be smaller\\" but revised this to 61 pieces including those in China in his second edition of 1980;Gompertz, 94 even among the museums the cast and numbers are somewhat different to the list Sotheby's gives in 2012, used above. This is based on a list by Degawa Tetsuro in an exhibition catalogue in 2009, with a few additions.Sotheby's (2012) Agreement on pieces can remain incomplete; one piece that seems to appear on neither list was identified as \\"Ru ware\\" by the Cincinnati Art Museum in 2016.\\"Tripod Vessel\\", Cincinnati Art Museum, acquired in 1950, not on display in 2016.

It had been in a Japanese collection, after belonging to the collection of Mr & Mrs Alfred Clark in London.Sotheby's (2012) This price was exceeded (considerably in $HK terms, rather less in US$ terms) by the sale in 2017 described above. In 2014 it was claimed that a Ru bowl had been identified in the collection of the Princessehof Ceramics Museum in Leeuwarden, The Netherlands.Porcelainista blog This piece is included in Regina Krahl's 2017 list.Sotheby's (2017), # 59 In 2016 an exhibition at the Beijing Palace Museum included 29 complete pieces, plus four reconstructed ones from a tomb, and many fragments from excavation. 30 later \\"Ru-type\\" pieces were also exhibited.

(The area of Wenchang contains the city of Wenchang further south.) The bridge reduced travel time from Haikou to Wenchang City from 90 minutes down to around 20 minutes. Location Location map The eastern end of the bridge terminates at the town of Puqian. The western end has abutments on, and crosses over, a small island named Beigang Island. It then terminates on the western side of the mouth of Dongzhai Harbor. There, it connects to the nearly complete Jiangdong Avenue () which runs west to connect to the Haikou New East Bridge and to start of Haidian No. 5 East Road which leads through Xinbu Island and into Haidian Island, part of Haikou City. Haiwen Bridge effectively connects the east side of the Dongzhai Harbor to Haikou. Construction Main pylon Haiwen Bridge is a single-pylon, double-plane, steel box girder, cable- stayed bridge. The entire length of the bridge is 5,600 metres long and 32 metres wide. The main span consists two, 230-metre sections, one on each side of the pylon. The deck is steel with a flat, closed box cross section 37.3 metres wide and 3.3 metres deep. The surface contains a two-way, six-lane road. Resistance to earthquakes The abutments are designed to handle considerable sway Because Haiwen Bridge crosses over a geological fault line, it is built to withstand earthquakes. The area was devastated by the 1605 Qiongshan earthquake. =Records= Haiwen Bridge is the biggest single-tower, double-cable-plane, steel box girder cable-stayed bridge in Hainan. As of 2018, compared to any other bridge in China, this bridge has the best seismic resistance fortification, is designed to resist the highest winds, and is the only cross-sea type bridge that is built over seismic faults. It is also a first in employing a continuous steel box, across-fault, girder structural system, as well as having the biggest domestic steel pipe foundation, which comprises thirty-two steel pipe composite piles, each one having a diameter of 4.3 metres.

Early life and education Ryberg was born on November 2, 1901 in Grimes, Iowa as Inez Gertrude Scott. Her father was a minister in a Presbyterian church and this influence in her early life lead to a major focus in Latin studies and religion. In 1921 Ryberg enrolled at the University of Minnesota to earn her BA in Latin and also enrolled for her MA the same year. In 1924 Ryberg transferred to the University of Wisconsin to study for her Ph.D. in which her thesis subject was the Grand Style in the Satires of Juvenal. While at UW Ryberg's Latin professor, George Converse Fiske, became her mentor, partially due to their mutual interest in Roman Religion, and helped steer her onto her future career path. After completing her Ph.D. thesis and teaching Latin at Wilson College in Pennsylvania for a year, Ryberg left the US to take a fellowship at the American Academy in Rome. Academic career =American Academy in Rome= Fiske was on the Advisory Council for Classical Studies at the American Academy in Rome and encouraged her to apply for the fellowship. Ryberg was one of three applicants who received the Rome Prize fellowship in 1924. The award included an annual stipend of $1250 and was for 2 years. During her time at the academy Ryberg studied under Tenney Frank of Johns Hopkins and Charles Rufus Morey of Princeton. Later in life during her time at Vassar, Ryberg took several leaves of absence to return to the Academy and work in the library and various museums in Rome. =Smith College and Vassar College= After returning from the American Academy in Rome, Ryberg spent a year teaching Latin at Smith College before arriving at Vassar as an Assistant Professor in 1927 and teaching until 1965. Ryberg accepted the position after another alumna of the Academy, Lily Ross Taylor, left Vassar to accept a position at Bryn Mawr College. Ryberg became Chair of the Classics department in 1942, when Elizabeth H. Haight retired, and held the position until her retirement, with the exception of 1949-1952 when she returned to the Academy for research. Vassar recognised Ryberg's academic abilities and funded several of her publications and research sabbaticals. Death In March 1965 in the Vassar Miscellany News it was announced that Ryberg was resigning from the University due to recent health concerns. She died in September 1980 in Gainesville, Florida. Personal life On June 11, 1930 Inez Scott married Milton Emmanuel Ryberg. Part of Inez Ryberg's success in the academic field had been dependent on her marriage, the couple rarely lived together, focusing more on their respective careers, but never so far apart that there were not regular visits scheduled. The pair never had children.

The building was constructed in 1910 for the credit union Ny Jydske Kjøbstad Creditforening (New Jut Market Town Credit Union), a name which still adorns the facade of the building. The building has functioned as a financial institution since it was built and was owned by Steen Mengel and rented to Danske Bank, who use it for their main Aarhus branch.  History  The credit union Ny jydske Kjøbstad-Creditforening was established in 1871 in Hjørring, and moved to Aarhus in 1878. It was established by the initiative of municipalities in Jutland to replace the credit union Kjøbstadgrundejere i Nørrejylland, founded in 1851 and bankrupted during the banking crisis of 1857. Initially it was housed in the 1st floor of a building on Immervad owned by the bookseller THeodor Valdemar Thrue. Between 1880 and 1885 the credit union was based on the 1st floor of Hans Broge's house in Mindegade. The organization quickly encountered storage problems as documents had to be stored in fire-safe enclosures. In 1885 the organization got a new building in Grønnegade 71 in a corner building on Nærre Allé. In 1910 a new building was inaugurated on Åboulevarden 69,  Architecture  The building was designed by the architects Eggert Achen and Thorkel Møller for Ny Jydske Kjøbstad-Creditforening. The architectural style is a mix of classical Baroque architecture inspired by the ideals of the renaissance such as English Baroque, and also by Art Nouveau. The imposing expression of the building is a result of the use of red brick, the granite detailing of the outer walls, the granite staircases, and its position some 10 meters from the street. In 1984 the architectural firm Kjær & Richter designed a new wing in red brick on a white, wooden structure. The building was renovated in 1996.

It was triggered by the death of Frederick Teesdale (the sitting Nationalist member) on 14 December 1931. The election was considered to be of great importance to the government of Sir James Mitchell, as a loss to the Labor Party would reduce his Nationalist–Country coalition to minority government.\\"POLITICAL STRATEGY\\" – The Sunday Times (Perth, Western Australia), 24 January 1932.

Marie, Ontario) is a pianist, singer/songwriter, composer, arranger, producer and author. He received his musical education at Berklee College of Music in Boston, where he studied Jazz Composition and Arranging, and his literary education at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, receiving a B.A. (Honours) in English and Film Studies.http://www.canadianjazzarchive.org/en/musicians/don-breithaupt.html Early life Breithaupt was raised in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (then a western suburb of Toronto) in a musical household. His father was a jazz piano enthusiast, and his mother was an accomplished classical soprano and choir director, so music was heard regularly in the home. His parents took him and his two younger brothers, who were also musically inclined, to concerts and bought them records. Breithaupt started taking piano lessons at a young age, but he discontinued the lessons at age eight. He took up the piano again at age twelve, at a time when Elton John, Billy Joel, and other piano-based pop artists were becoming radio staples. He picked up this and other music by ear, eventually developing an insider's knowledge of the work of Steely Dan, the Beatles, Chicago, and Paul Simon. He played the drums in rock bands during his high school years, but never abandoned the piano. Songwriting became his strongest interest. As an English/Film undergraduate at Queen's University in nearby Kingston, Ontario, Breithaupt spent much of his spare time at Harrison- LeCaine Hall, practicing piano, writing songs, and teaching himself the craft of arranging. He immersed himself in jazz: the Pat Metheny Group, Weather Report, and several of the pianists he had first heard as a child: Bill Evans, Oscar Peterson, and Dave Brubeck. In 1983, upon completion of his bachelor's degree, Breithaupt was awarded a full scholarship to Berklee College of Music by the Frederick Harris Music Company.http://somethingelsereviews.com/2016/06/12/don-briethaupt-monkey- house-interview/ Career As a songwriter, his work has been covered by artists including Alfie Zappacosta, Marc Jordan, Dione Taylor, Sarah Slean, Denzal Sinclaire, Patricia O'Callaghan, Wendy Lands, and Chris Smith.http://www.canadianjazzarchive.org/en/musicians/don-breithaupt.html He has co-written three songs nominated for Juno Awards (the Canadian Grammy),http://www.insidemusicast.com/about-us/ > and has twice been a co- winner (along with his brother Jeff) in both the American Songwriting Competition, and the International Songwriting Competition.http://www.mi2n.com/press.php3?press_nb=137226http://mqlit.ca/playwrights/breithaupt- brothers/ As a musician, he has performed with the Kim Mitchell Band, Rik Emmett, and Sass Jordan, and he leads his own group, Monkey House, which have released six albums, the most recent is the album Left in June 2016.http://www.canadianjazzarchive.org/en/musicians/don-breithaupt.html Breithaupt recorded an album in 2006 of his own original piano compositions (with cello and acoustic guitar accompaniment) entitled Breathing Space,http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,4881279,00.html re-released as part of a multiple CD set called Peace: Music for Relaxation.

He served as National Coaching Director from 1974 to 1995, and was a leading figure in lifting the standard of Australian rugby.It’s time Australian rugby whistled forold warhorse Dick Marks; www.theaustralian.com.au; 17 Sep 2016 He also served on the Board of Queensland Rugby and was an inaugural member of rugby's International Technical Committee and drafter of the Game’s Charter. He received the Joe French Award for his contributions to Australian Rugby in 2014, and remains active in debates on governance of Australian rugby. He is the grandfather of Queensland Reds player Curtis Browning. Early life Marks was born in Bundaberg Queensland in 1942, and later attended boarding school at Brisbane Grammar School, where he was an accomplished sportsman and scholar and captained both cricket and rugby. Marks progressed to the University of Queensland Rugby Club, and made the Queensland U19 team in 1961.Meares and Howell; Wallaby Legends; Lothian Books, 2005 Rugby career Dick Marks played in the centres for Australia throughout the \\"Thornett Era\\", which saw the national side rise to new heights of success on the international stage. The Queenslander made an impact from an early age with his tackling skills, speed and ability to break the line. In 1962, he played for Queensland against the touring All Blacks, scoring the home side's only try. The selectors picked the 19 year old for the Second Test against the All Blacks in Sydney, however a bout of illness prevented him from playing. Later that year, he was selected for the 1962 Australia rugby union tour of New Zealand, captained by John Thornett. He debuted in the Second Test at Dunedin in the centres alongside Beres Ellwood, just two days after turning 20, and impressed with his fierce tackling. He cemented a place in the Wallaby side playing seven of 13 tour matches including two tests. In 1963 Marks played in the historic defeat of the first England tour side in Australia, played at the SCG in driving rain. He was later selected for the watershed 1963 Australia rugby union tour of South Africa, which saw Thornett's Wallabies tie a series against South Africa for the first time, and, in the process, became the first side to score back to back victories in the two tests over the Spring Boks since 1896. Marks played in three of the four tests, setting up winger John Williams for a crucial try in the historic Third Test victory at Ellis Park, Johannesburg.Peter Jenkins; Wallaby Gold: The History of Australian Test Rugby; Random House; 2003 Marks was selected again for the 1964 Australia rugby union tour of New Zealand, playing six of eight matches, including the three tests. The tour featured another historic high for Australian rugby, with a 29-5 victory in the Third Test at Wellington, which remains the highest margin loss for New Zealand at home to this day. More success following in 1965, when Australia won a series over South Africa for the first time. Marks played against the Spring Boks in their two tests and for Queensland. He missed selection for Australia against the touring Lions the following year, but captained Queensland against the side. He then played in every test of the 1966–67 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France which saw an historic first victory over Wales and a record win over England. Marks again played for Australia against the touring Irish in 1967, and captained Queensland against them. He then retired as Wallaby, but continued to play for Queensland until 1969 - and had a comeback season in 1972. He had played 51 matches for Australia at home and abroad, and captained the Wallabies against a French provincial side in 1967. He ranked the historic wins of the Spring Boks in 1963, New Zealand in 1964 and Wales in 1966 as career highlights. Rugby historian Jack Pollard described him as \\"a versatile centre who did everything sensibly and reduced mistakes to a minimum. There was nothing flash or colourful in his football, but he tackled hard and ran strongly...\\". Meares and Howell wrote that \\"His was a proud record. He had played fifty-one matches for his country, including 17 Tests. He was highly respected by his peers, so much so that when Rothmans set up its Director of Coaching position for rugby, he obtained the position in 1974.\\" National Coaching Director 1974-1995 In 1974, Marks became the inaugural Rothmans Coaching Director, with responsibilities for establishing a National Coaching Scheme for Australian Rugby. He remained in the job until 1995, through an unprecedented period of success for Australian rugby. He authored an influential Coaching Manual, instigated a number of coach and player development initiatives, and served on the first IRB Technical Committee and wrote a Charter of the Game. After the nadir of Australian rugby in the early 1970s and a l973 loss to Tonga, the Australian Rugby Union created a National Coaching Plan to “teach coaches the art of coaching through demonstration and practical involvement.” As the first national Coaching Director, Marks was tasked with writing a 300 page Rugby Coaching Manual, consisting of conceptual and practical tuition. Rugby writer Spiro Zavos describes the manual as \\"a compendium of the best in rugby thinking and practice at the time. It is a masterpiece. If Aristotle had written about rugby, this is the sort of manual he would have produced... The point in all of this is that the National Coaching Plan worked. From the despair of the 1970s Australian rugby gloried in nearly two decades of success.\\"Oh no, Waratahs 0! What has happened with skills coaching in Australian rugby?; theroar.com.au; 22 April 2018 The rugby historians Meares and Howell wrote of Marks' time as Coaching Director: The Marks directorship established a number of other innovations. Russel Tulloch of Norths Rugby wrote for The Australian newspaper that under the Marks regime: \\"development officers used the national coaching process, the ground-breaking and world- recognised program developed under the auspices of David Clark from the Australian Institute of Sport, run by Dick Marks and Brian O’Shea, and sponsored by Rothmans. Some funding was available from the ARU but predominantly came from the clubs. This program consolidated skilled coaching processes and was available to all coaches throughout Australia. It provided a consistent and practical methodology and played a significant role in improving the quality of coaching of rugby in Australia... It is interesting to note that most of the players in the winning 1999 RWC had come from the amateur programs and were coached by people from the Clark/Marks/O’Shea program...\\".Time for serious players to address rugby’s maladies; /www.theaustralian.com.au' 9 May 2017 Rothman's sponsorship of the program ended in the mid 1990s, and Marks was invited to continue in his position of National Director of Coaching on the payroll of the Australian Rugby Union. However, ill-health forced the resignation of the CEO, and his successor John O'Neil controversially replaced Marks with Welsh coach Alex Evans, whose background was not in coach education and whose tenure was short-lived. Nevertheless, wrote Meares and Howell, \\"the foundation laid by the coaching scheme ensured that outstanding Wallaby performances carried on through to the 1999 World Cup win.\\" Later career, awards and activism Marks has made a name as a public speaker and master of ceremonies, \\"arguably the finest sports MC in the land\\" according to Meares and Howell. In 2014, he was awarded the prestigious Joe French Award for outstanding service to rugby over a long period of time. He remains influential in rugby circles, and in 2019 endorsed the #LetsFixAustralianRugby campaign to reform administration of the game in Australia, telling the Sydney Morning Herald: \\"We had a great system which won us two Rugby World Cups and produced Alan Jones, Bob Dwyer and Rod Macqueen.

In 1999, he joined Saarland University as professor of theoretical physics. In 2005, he moved to Goethe university Frankfurt. Gros now works in complex systems theory, focusing on complex adaptive systems relevant to the neurosciences. His lecture course on the subject has seen four editions.Claudius Gros: Complex and Adaptive Dynamical Systems, A Primer, Springer (2008, second, third and forth edition 2010 / 2013 / 2015). In 2016, Gros published a novel.Claudius Gros: Mageia, das Buch der Farben, tredition (2016). Genesis Project In 2016 Gros studied the feasibility of a low-cost interstellar mission, aiming to establish a biosphere of unicellular organisms on otherwise only transiently habitable exoplanets, fast-forwarding evolution potentially by several billion years. The long mission duration would imply, according to Gros, that the Genesis Project would not have any tangible benefit for humanity. The initial acceleration could be achieved by laser propulsion, akin to that envisioned by the Breakthrough Starshot project, with passive deceleration at the target using magnetic sails. Overall, the probe would weight about 1.5 tons and travel at 0.3 percent of the speed of light.James Romero, Should we seed life through the cosmos using laser-driven ships?, New Scientist, November 13 (2017). An on-board miniaturized gene laboratory would synthesize the microbes.Ewen Callaway: Minimal cell raises stakes in race to harness synthetic life The precambrian biosphere established by the Genesis probe would evolve subsequently on its own, potentially to complex lifeforms. The concept of the Genesis Project carries a series of fundamental ethical and philosophical aspects, which have been discussed in the media.

Rogers did have the presence of mind to recruit a guitarist and a few percussionists to give the music an authentic flavor, and the music is earnestly played. However, bossa nova works best with a less rambunctious approach. Rogers never seemed capable of approaching anything delicately, and he overwhelms the melodies with brassy riffs.

Incident Prior to their assignment to Camp Van Dorn, the soldiers of the unit were involved in a racial incident in Phoenix, Arizona, known as The Phoenix Massacre, in which soldiers from the 364th rioted in Phoenix overnight. In June 1943, about 1,200 Negro soldiers were allegedly massacred by fellow white soldiers at Camp Van Dorn. An investigation by the U.S. Army has accounted for the whereabouts of all of the individual soldiers alleged to have been murdered. This incident was alleged to have occurred by an Army clerk, Carrol Case, in his self-published book, The Slaughter. The soldiers protested racial strife in the base and surrounding community; the Army confirmed at least half a dozen racial incidents occurred in the area. The Army denies the massacre ever took place and although Case and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People have found accounts of unrest, nothing has surfaced that hints at a massacre. The bodies were said by the author of The Slaughter to have been buried on the outskirts of the base and covered by a lake. One soldier, Private William Walker, is confirmed to have died, having been shot by a local sheriff while escaping from military police at the front gate. He was returning to base from rest and recuperation. Following these incidents, the soldiers participated in the Louisiana Maneuvers and were stationed in the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. At the end of World War II, 1,000 of 3,000 original soldiers remained of the 364th, an attrition rate of at least one per day. Other \\"troublemakers\\" were sent to various parts of the nation. Public reaction Ronald Ridenhour, who had previously investigated the My Lai massacre, became interested in the story and began interviewing local Centreville residents. After his death the story of the alleged massacre was publicized in the two-part book, The Slaughter, by Carroll Case, a former banker who investigated the case. Part one presents historical documentation and analysis of the case; part two is a fictionalized account in which Case attempts to further explain what happened at Camp Van Dorn. The NAACP, under Kwesi Mfume, asked for an investigation into this incident by Janet Reno.

She is known as the first anthropologist to visit Chinese villages in a period when political actions made access into the country for foreigners difficult. Croll published books on the subject and held several short-term fellowships at various educational institutions. She also worked for United Nations agencies and international non-government organisations. Early life Croll was born Elizabeth Sprackett in the remote New Zealand town of Reefton on the country's South Island on 21 September 1944. Her father, a Presbyterian minister, came from a poor background, while her mother's family was involved in the foundation of New Zealand's first university. They had ties with China from the early 20th century and her father worked with Chinese refugees in the early 1960s, with included a three- month period in Hong Kong. Croll's parents ingrained her with a lifelong love of books and learning, along with a powerful sense of duty. She preferred to be called \\"Lisa\\". Croll was educated at a Christchurch school, and later studied for a Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts history degree at the University of Canterbury. In 1962, her family reclocated to Sydney. Croll chose to remain in New Zealand because she was still reading and met Jim Croll whom she married in 1966. They had two children, Nicholas and Katherine. She moved with Jim to London after he was offered a Lectureship in civil engineering at University College. Croll graduated from the SOAS, University of London with a Master of Arts in Far Eastern Studies and Doctor of Philosophy degree in Chinese anthropology in 1977. Her time at the university allowed her to develop an interest in anthropology and China. Career She undertook two-week missions research trips into rural China, and was the first anthropologist to get to villages when political actions made foreigners access into the country difficult. Croll gained the Chinese people's trust, allowing for fellow Western anthropologists to follow in her footsteps. Long term travel into the country was not possible in that period, although she became a prominent person within SOAS. She published her first book Feminism and Socialism in China in 1978, and pioneered a study of Chinese women's movement. Croll's second book, Politics of Marriage in Contemporary China published in 1981, brought an anthropological approach study to political reform. It suggested Chinese government's marriage reforms which was based on free decision and sexual equality would be difficult to enforce and conflict between elderly people and the state would be produced. She later wrote the books Food in the Domestic Economy in China (1983), Chinese Women Since Mao (1984) and China's One-Child Family Policy and Women and Rural Development in China in 1985. Croll held a number of short-term fellowships at the Contemporary China Institute, SOAS's Department of Anthropology, University of Sussex's Institute of Development Studies, the Oxford Department of International Development, Wolfson College, Oxford, Princeton University and the International Institute of Social Studies. She was appointed SOAS' lecturer in anthropology in 1990, and became its senior lecturer one year later. Croll became a reader in 1993, before becoming professor of Chinese anthropology in 1995. Croll started an anthropology of development course, one of the first in the United Kingdom and petitioned to include a social element to the programme. In that period, she wrote two further books called From Heaven to Earth: Images and Experiences of Development in China in 1993, and Changing Identities of Chinese Women: rhetoric, experience and self-perception in 20th-century China two years later. Croll was a regular worker for a large variety of agencies of the United Nations, including the International Labour Organization, World Bank, Ford Foundation, the Department for International Development, Food and Agriculture Organization, International Fund for Agricultural Development, UNICEF and several international non-government organisations. = Later career and death = She was an adviser to the All- China Women's Federation on issues relating to gender, and was involved in campaigns to highlight's an issue over missing girls and unwanted daughters in China and Asia. Croll counselled the country's government on issues concerning poverty alleviation, social development and gender issues. At the Royal Society of Asian Affairs, she was its executive member, vice-chairperson of the Great Britain-China Centre. Croll was appointed to the United Nations Council in Tokyo in 1998. She was later elected its Vice-Chairperson in 2002, before becoming Chairperson two years later. Croll founded the Chair of the Centre of Chinese Studies and was head of its Department of Development Studies. She was appointed SOAS' Vice-Principal with special responsibility for External Relations. Her final book China's New Consumers: Social Development and Domestic Demand was published in autumn 2006. Croll died of cancer on 3 October 2007 in London. She was due to receive the CMG from the Queen on 10 October \\"for services to Higher Education, especially in promoting understanding of China's social development\\", but due to her death, her daughter received it on Croll's behalf.

The memorial was designed by Reginald Wynn Owen, architect to the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) and commemorates employees of the LNWR who were killed in the First World War. The memorial is today a grade II* listed building. History and design The memorial was paid for by donations from LNWR staff. It consists of a single obelisk, high in Portland stone, which stands on a tall pedestal and a circular base of grey granite. At the foot of the obelisk is a moulded reed band, just below which the obelisk is moulded to the pedestal. Buttresses protruding from the pedestal on four sides act as steps; on top of each is a bronze over life-size statue, sculpted by Ambrose Neale, the chief artist of the main contractor for the war memorial, RL Boulton & Sons of Cheltenham. The four figures represent the infantry, artillery, Royal Navy, and the Royal Air Force respectively, each statue standing with its head bowed and resting on an upturned rifle. The memorial is unusual amongst First World War memorials in featuring the air force so prominently. On each side of the obelisk, near the top, is a bronze wreath and a stone cross protruding from the body itself. The only inscription on the obelisk itself is IN MEMORY OF OUR GLORIOUS DEAD on the south face (the front as one walks towards Euston station), though a granite tablet in front of the memorial contains the further inscription IN GRATEFUL MEMORY OF 3719 MEN OF THE LONDON AND NORTH- WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY WHO FOR THEIR COUNTRY, JUSTICE AND FREEDOM SERVED AND DIED IN THE GREAT WAR 1914–1919. THIS MONUMENT WAS RAISED BY THEIR COMRADES AND THE COMPANY AS A LASTING MEMORIAL TO THEIR DEVOTION. Further tablets were added later to commemorate casualties from the Second World War, by which time the LNWR had been merged into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.Boorman (1988), pp. 27–28.Boorman (2005), pp. 42–43. The memorial's site was originally in the centre of Euston Square on the approach road to the station and on an axis with the Euston Arch prior to the latter's demolition in the 1960s; the area has since been redeveloped and the memorial now sits in front of a modern officebuilding. It was unveiled by Field Marshal Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig, the commander of British forces on the Western Front during the war, on 21 October 1921 while the dedication was performed by Randall Davidson, the Archbishop of Canterbury.

It takes one of its names from the nearby Royal Docks. It was listed as Grade II* in 1971 and now houses the Brick Lane Music Hall. History =Construction= The church was founded as a joint church and school, housed in an iron building and opened in 1857. Samuel Sanders Teulon was taken on as the designer of a permanent church, which opened in 1862 and was promoted to a separate parish two years later, taking parts of Woolwich (centred on St Mary Magdalene Woolwich on the opposite bank of the Thames) and East Ham. The docks' manager Charles Capper was allowed to nominate the first vicar, but after that the bishop of London (or after 1884 the Corporation of the City of London) was made the parish's patron. St Mark's also founded mission churches at St Matthew's, Custom House in 1860, which was later transferred to St Luke's Church, Canning Town before becoming a parish of its own in 1920. St Luke's itself was originally a mission church of St Mark's before being made a parish of its own on its permanent church's completion in 1875. St Mark's also opened the mission churches of St John's, North Woolwich in 1872 (which took the East Ham part of St Mark's parish in 1877 to become a parish church of its own) and St Barnabas' Church, West Silvertown in 1882 (which became a parish of its own in 1926).A History of the County of Essex: Volume 6. Originally published by Victoria County History, London, 1973; Pages 114–123 =Redundancy= The building survived the war but the decline of the London docks in the 1960s led to a sharp drop in local population and major slum clearances in the area. The church was declared redundant in 1974 and its parish merged with those of two of its former mission churches, St Barnabas' and St John's – St Barnabas was also declared redundant, with St John's becoming the sole church for the resulting parish of North Woolwich with Silvertown. The church building was bought in 1979 by Newham Council, with the intention of turning it into a museum. A major fire in 1981 largely destroyed the roof, which was replaced between 1984 and 1989. =Brick Lane Music Hall= After the fire the Brick Lane Music Hall took on the building, converting it to its present use in 2003–2004 to host traditional music hall and (since 2006) produced shows. Brick Lane Music Hall had opened in 1982 in the former Truman’s Brewery building in Brick Lane, before moving to Shoreditch and then its present building. It was established by Vincent Hayes, who had previously performed with his band at the Lord Hood pub, where he was landlord during the 1980s. The church's exterior was left largely unchanged, whilst a stage, bar, kitchen and lighting and sound equipment were added to the interior, with offices housed in the church's former vestry.Moving heaven and earth for a music hall The Daily Telegraph, retrieved 30 November 2016 In 2004 a mural was painted on the wall behind the church's exterior war memorial, whilst a new lighting and sound rig was installed in October 2006.

History In the Soviet Union, Alexei Starobinsky noted that quantum corrections to general relativity should be important for the early universe. These generically lead to curvature-squared corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action and a form of f(R) modified gravity. The solution to Einstein's equations in the presence of curvature squared terms, when the curvatures are large, leads to an effective cosmological constant. Therefore, he proposed that the early universe went through an inflationary de Sitter era.; This resolved the cosmology problems and led to specific predictions for the corrections to the microwave background radiation, corrections that were then calculated in detail. Starobinsky used the action : S = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\kappa} \\\\int \\\\left(R + \\\\frac{R^2}{6M^2} \\\\right) \\\\sqrt{\\\\vert g\\\\vert}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}^4x, where \\\\kappa=8\\\\pi G/c^4 and R is the Ricci scalar. This action corresponds to the potential V(\\\\phi) = \\\\Lambda^4 \\\\left(1 - e^{-\\\\sqrt{2/3} \\\\phi/M_p} \\\\right)^2 in the Einstein frame. Observables Starobinsky inflation gives a prediction for the observables of the spectral tilt n_s and the tensor-scalar ratio r: n_s = 1 - \\\\frac{2}{N}, \\\\quad r = \\\\frac{12}{N^2}, where N is the number of e-foldings since the horizon crossing.

He was also, at various times, secretary and president of the National Association of Ikire Students(NAIS) both at OAU Chapter and National body. In 1992, some five years after he left university, Oyewumi contested and, through the massive votes of his people in Irewole/Ayedaade/Isokan Federal Constituency, won a seat in the House of Representatives, Abuja under the platform of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) whose presidential candidate was Bashorun MKO Abiola. He was a member of House Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development;and Chairman, Sub-Committee on National Agriculture Land Development Authority(NALDA). The political instability of the period brought the Republic to an abrupt end. Subsequently, Akogun Oyewumi joined forces with other democrats to defend the country's fledgling democracy. On June 12, Oyewumi became chairman of the Yoruba socio-cultural group Afenifere in Irewole Local Government and; he, together with other politicians and lovers of democracy, galvanised and articulated the message of \\"June 12\\" in every nook and cranny of Osun State. He was vibrant and actively involved in the struggle to drive the military government of General Babangida and General Sani Abacha back to barracks. At the return of civilian rule in 1999, Akogun was made the publicity secretary of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun State. In 2004, after having served as a caretaker chairman of Irewole Local Government for one year, he was elected substantive chairman and served in this capacity until 2011, when the government of Governor Rauf Aregbesola dissolved the local councils in the state. Oyewumi, because of his stern leadership quality and exemplary achievements as local government chairman, was made the chairman of Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) in Osun State and vice president in the national executive. Family life Akogun Lere Oyewumi is married to Yeye Omolara Oyewumi, and the marriage is blessed with 4 children. Achievements During his tenure as chairman of Irewole local government, Oyewumi constructed and rehabilitated Sunmoye-Obada road, Obada-Jolaiya-Sabo road, Itaakun-Popo road, Oke-Ola-Oluofinrin road, Iyana-Egba-Ayedaade road, Okiti Islamiya road, Itaakun-Molak junction. His government is reputed to have carried out general electrification of Irewole Local Government with concrete poles, cables and extensions. He also ensured 5 units of 500 KVA transformers were procured and installed to cater for the growing suburb population. The following areas benefitted from the gesture: Elere compound, Sunmoye Ikire, Oja Ale, Oke Ada, Anajere Oluofinrin and Islamia junction, which are all in Ikire. Oyewumi's government also constructed boreholes at Odeyinka, Olode Falola, Dede village and Akinropo. This particular performance of Oyewumi's government motivated RUWESA in conjunction with UNICEF in 2010 to provide additional 250 units of boreholes to the local government. In addition, over 200 units of public taps, that spread across the length and breadth of Irewole Local Government were constructed. Honours Oyewumi was honoured the Best Chairman in the South West by International Trade and Services, South Africa. He was also awarded the Best Nigerian Local Government Chairman in the Provision of Infrastructural Facilities by Grassroots Development Survey, Abuja. Oyewumi holds the traditional titles of Akogun of Awoland, Apesin of Ikireland, Fiwajoye of Ola, Aare Atunluse of Erin-sun, Jagun–Osiri of Imesi- Ile, Jagunmolu of Ilie, Bobajiro of the Ora Kingdom and Atayese of the Ikoyi Kingdom, Atunluse of Ila Kingdom.

Starting from the very bottom of the social ladder, P.

The Community was established during the era of the Second Caliphate, shortly before the Second World War. Ghulam Hussain Ayyaz was the first missionary sent to the region, who under the direction of the caliph, arrived in 1935, in a period when the territory was part of the Straits Settlements. In the 1970s, the Community had roughly 200 followers, represented by 1-2% of the Muslim population. History In the 1920s, a number of Ahmadi Muslim journals and books published in India were known to be widely circulated in a number of South East Asian countries, including Singapore. Ahmadiyya influences reached such heights that a protest held at the Victoria Memorial Hall attracted over two thousand people. However, the formal history of the Ahmadiyya movement in Singapore begins 1935, when the second caliph of the Community, Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad sent Ghulam Hussain Ayyaz as a missionary to a number of British territories in the Malay Peninsula. Singapore, along with modern-day Malaysian states of Malacca and Penang, were part of the Straits Settlements, a number of British territories within the peninsula. Ayyaz was among the first batch of missionaries sent all over the world by the caliph. According to the recorded history of the Ahmadiyya movement, the first person to become an Ahmadi Muslim was Haji Jaafar, who embraced his new faith in 1938, three years following the arrival of Ayyaz in Singapore. The first president of the movement in Singapore was Engku Ismail bin Abdul Rahman, a descendant of the Johor royal family. His successor was Hamid Salikin who took office in 1955. In 1966 Muhammad Osman Chou, an Ahmadi Muslim missionary who grew up in Anhui, China, was transferred to Singapore in April 1966. During his term, which lasted 3 years, he translated a number of Ahmadiyya books into Mandarin, including, The Philosophy of the Teachings of Islam and Ahmadiyyat, the True Islam. The first Annual Convention in Singapore was held on 26 and 27 December 1987, after more than 50 years following the introduction of the movement in Singapore. The convention, which had 121 members in attendance, was held joint with its neighboring country of Malaysia. The fourth caliph of the community, Mirza Tahir Ahmad paid a visit to Singapore on September 8, 1984. During his visit, which lasted a week, he laid the foundation stone for the Community's first mosque in Singapore to which he gave the name Taha Mosque. Persecution On June 23, 1969, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore issued a fatwa declaring the Ahmadiyya movement a group falling outside the fold of Islam. Taha Mosque, the only Ahmadiyya Muslim mosque in Singapore During the 1980s, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community of Singapore built their first purpose-built mosque, on Onan Road, Geylang, in central Singapore. The site previously consisted of a building, which was already used as a place of worship by Ahmadi Muslims, until a storm brought sufficient damage to the structure to demand a reconstruction. The new mosque was opened in 1985. Observing the development, a number of Muslims, showing particular concern of the building's appearance, urged the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore to take urgent action on the spread of Ahmadiyya, whose teachings they considered \\"un- Islamic\\". Othman Haron Eusofe forwarded this \\"concern\\" at the Community Development Ministry. Ahmad Mattar, the then Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs reinforced Eusofe's view, stating that the Ahmadi Muslims were intentionally being provocative by calling their mosque, a mosque. Throughout the year Mattar was vocal in his opposition to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, warning of the \\"dangers\\" posed by the Community. As a consequence, the Council attempted to produce \\"comprehensive\\" measures in an attempt to tackle the spread of the Community's teachings in Singapore. A committee with members representing 11 different Muslim Singaporean organizations was set up by the Council. In 1989 Ahmadi Muslims posted religious pamphlets in letterboxes, including those belonging to mainstream Muslims. This provoked mainstream Muslims throughout the country, expressing concern that this would \\"mislead and confuse\\" young Muslims. On January 27, 2008, about a dozen graves belonging to members of the Community were desecrated at the Choa Chu Kang Cemetery, on the western portion of the island. The cemetery is the largest in the country, and comprises cemeteries of various religious denominations, including about 30 graves of Ahmadi Muslims.

There are three subspecies, each of which has a single hairy leaf and one or two brightly coloured flowers with upswept sepals and a labellum with long, comb-like fringes. The subspecies differ in size, distribution and habitat. Description Caladenia attingens is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf long and wide. The lower part of the leaf often has reddish blotches. There are one or two flowers on a hairy spike high, each flower long and wide. The flowers are green, white and yellow with reddish-purple areas. The dorsal sepal is erect, sometimes curves forward, long, wide with a swollen glandular tip . The lateral sepals are long, wide and upswept with a glandular tip similar to the one on the dorsal sepal. The petals are long, long, spread widely and usually lack a glandular tip. The labellum is greenish-yellow with a red tip and four or more rows of dark red calli along its centre. The sides of the labellum bear long, green, comb-like teeth. Flowering occurs between August and November. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia attingens was first formally described by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown in 2001 and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (attingens) is a Latin word meaning \\"reaching to\\" or \\"attaining\\", referring to the calli which extend as far as the tip of the labellum. When Hooper and Brown described the species, they also described two subspecies, C. attingens subsp. attingens and C. attingens subsp. gracillima. Since then, a third subspecies has been described by Andrew Brown and Garry Brockman and given the name C. attingens subsp. effusa. Distribution and habitat Mantis orchids occur between Perth and Israelite Bay, growing in a range of habitats, depending on subspecies. Conservation All three subspecies of Caladenia attingens are classified as \\"Not Threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Expeditions include climbs in New Zealand and throughout South America, including the technically demanding Mount Fitzroy 3,405 m (11,171 ft), Patagonia, Argentina, volcanos in Ecuador and many peaks in Argentina, Chile, Peru and throughout the European Alps, prior to climbing in the Himalayas. On an expedition to Aconcagua 6,961 m (22,838 ft), Argentina in 2007, Agnew was part of a team led by Jon Muir when it became apparent that Muir had succumbed to altitude sickness and couldn’t continue to guide the team. At high camp, the famed Viento Blanco (white wind) caused all climbing teams at height to attempt an evacuationhttp://www.aconcaguaascents.com/climate.php. One of Agnew’s fellow team members experienced life-threatening High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE), needing immediate evacuation down the mountain and subsequently airlifted to Mendoza hospital. Agnew was left to lead the remaining team member’s survival throughout a deadly night (including a tent fire and a death close by) at high camp. The retreat down the mountain the next day was memorable to Aconcagua’s base camp which was also devastated and many teams lost the majority of their equipment. After many successful summits throughout the world (North and South America, the Andes and in the Alps), Agnew was one of six Australians and two Britons who made it to the summit of Mount Everest on 25 May 2010, with an expedition led by South Australian Duncan Chessell. Agnew finished the last of the Seven Summits with Mount Vinson, Antarctica in December 2014, becoming the first Canberran and oldest Australian to do so.Kelly, Emma., 19 Jan 2015), ‘Canberra mountaineer Rick Agnew’s amazing story of seven summits in seven years’, The Canberra Times. http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/canberra-life/canberra-mountaineer- rick-agnews-amazing-story-of-seven-summits-in-seven-years-20150102-12h7m6.html Agnew's climbing continues with a successful speed ascent of the technical Ama Dablam 6,812 m (22,349 ft) in Nov 2015, climbing back up from the precarious Camp 2 to rescue a young Australianhttp://www.alyssaazar.com.au/espresso- kick/ama-dablam-2014/; and an attempt on Shishapangma 8,027m (26,335 ft) in May 2016 and a successful ascent on the eighth highest mountain in the world Mt Manaslu, 8,163m (26,781 ft), Agnew being the oldest Australian to do so in Sept 2018. A massive avalanche stopped Agnew from a successful summit of the world's second highest mountain, K2 8,611m (28,251 ft) in Pakistan. On 17 July 2019 Agnew on the Abruzzi route was halted at the end of the famous Bottleneck's narrow couloir, reaching 8,350 m of K2's 8,611 m altitude. Gliding Agnew trained with several Australian gliding clubs, soloing with the Canberra Gliding Club prior to his officer and pilot training with the Royal Australian Air Force. Agnew is a three diamond badged pilot (Dec 1992) who has achieved the Australian altitude record in a glider when he reached 10,000m (33,000 ft) in 1995. He achieved his 1,000 km Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) & diploma on 25 Nov 2005.FAI 1000km badge number 492 Agnew is the winner of the Gliding Federation of Australia’s annual Martin Warner Trophy, for highest height gain, winning 17 times in the last twenty yearshttp://www.hgfa.asn.au/skysailor/e-issues/Soaring%20Australia%202010-12.pdf. Agnew has over 40 International and Australian speed, distance & height records. Agnew is a graduate of the Australian National University, obtaining a BSc(Forestry) in between bushwalking and learning to fly gliders. He undertook officer and pilot training with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), is a graduate of the Australian Defense Force Academy (Masters in Defense Studies), and University of Canberra (Master’s in Public Administration and a Doctorate in risk management). Agnew holds a post- graduate qualification in aviation medicine from Monash University. When not summiting peaks, Agnew presents on the risk management aspects of high altitude activities, as well as other aspects of governance, assurance organisational resilience and risk management – having run public and private sector governance, assurance and risk management areas within PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloittes, Aurecon and with government.

Newman represented Jamaica in two events at the 1976 Summer Olympics. He made the semi-finals of the 800 metres and finished fifth in contentious circumstances, having been bumped during the race by US runner Rick Wohlhuter. The American was disqualified after the race but later reinstated, a decision which cost Newman a place in the final. He was also a member of the 4 × 400 metres relay team which made the final and finished in fifth position. He won both the 400 metres and 800 metres races at the 1977 Central American and Caribbean Championships in Athletics. His run in the 400 metres final was in a field which included Cuba's Olympic champion Alberto Juantorena and set a personal best time, 45.66. At the 1978 Commonwealth Games he won silver medals in the 800 metres and the 4 × 400 metres relay. His personal best in the 800 metres, a time of 1:45.2 set in Helsinki in 1977, remains a Jamaican national record.

The first synthesis was described by Karl Dimroth and coworkers in 1961. It is one of the three isomers of the benzoxepins.  Occurrence and synthesis  3-Benzoxepin itself is a non-natural compound, but the bicyclic ring system is part of the naturally occurring compounds perilloxin (I) from Perilla frutescens (variant acuta) and tenual (II) and tenucarb (III) from Asphodeline tenuior. Perilloxin inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase with an IC50 of 23.2 μM. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen also work by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme family. :Structural formulas of perilloxin, tenual, and tenucarb Unsubstituted 3-benzoxepin can be synthesized through a double Wittig reaction from o-phthalaldehyde with bis-(α,α′-triphenylphosphonium)-dimethylether-dibromide. The latter compound can be synthesized from α,α′-dibromodimethyl ether (bis(bromomethyl)ether or BBME) which is accessible from hydrobromic acid, paraformaldehyde, and triphenylphosphine. The reaction is performed in dry methanol with sodium methoxide, and the product is obtained in 55% yield. :Synthesis from 3-benzoxepin according to K. Dimroth The compound can also be obtained through UV-irratiation of certain naphthalene derivatives such as 1,4-epoxy-1,4-dihydronaphthalene. :3-Benzoxepin from UV-irradiation from epoxydihydronaphthaline It can also be obtained by photooxidation of 1,4-dihydronaphthalene, followed by pyrolysis of the formed hydroperoxides. :3-Benzoxepin durch Pyrolyse aus Hydroperoxydihydronaphthalen The latter syntheses give 3-benzoxepins in low yields (4–6%). Properties 3-Benzoxepin is a bright yellow solid that crystallizes in platelets, with a smell similar to naphthalene. The material is soluble in apolar, organic solvents. Like naphthalene, it can be purified through sublimation. The solid is relatively acid-resistant, only under refluxing in concentrated, acidic alcohol solutions an unsaturated aldehyde is formed (likely an indene-3-aldehyde).

This was Ali's first boxing bout after The Rumble in the Jungle. The fight was billed as Give the White Guy a Break. Ali won the fight after he knocked out Wepner in the fifteenth round. The fight is notable for being among the four fights in which Ali was officially knocked down in the ring, and for inspiring the 1976 film Rocky. Background Wepner was 35 years old at this time. His professional record comprised thirty wins, nine losses, and two draws. He had earned the moniker \\"The Bayonne Bleeder\\" because he would readily get cut during boxing fights, and because he was from Bayonne, New Jersey. Prior to the Ali fight, Wepner had fought with Sonny Liston in Liston's final boxing match; after the bout Wepner had required 120 stitches. The fight was expected to be an easy win for Ali who did minimal training for it. Asked why he had not trained harder for this fight, Ali had commented: Buildup \\"Don King induced a Cleveland tycoon named Carl Lombardo to underwrite the show for $1.3‐million. Video Techniques put in $200,000 and that just about took care of the nut. Video Techniques had snatched the champion out of Top Rank's clutches but now had a mismatch in a cornfield; a million‐dollar turkey in a 5 and 10 cent store.\\" Ali and Wepner did some television interviews together to promote the fight. They were on 'The Mike Douglas Show' when Ali leaned towards Wepner during a break and said: Upon Wepner's refusal to grant him the favor he sought, Ali started shouting as soon as the show's host reappeared on the set: \\"Do you know what he called me? Do you know what he called me?\\" Wepner then covered Ali's mouth with his hand.\\" Ali was a promoter. He was a great promoter and they were trying to hype up the fight,\\" Wepner explained. =Mrs Wepner and Stallone= Before the fight, Wepner was lying in bed with his wife when he told her something like \\"Even if I don't win, I just want to prove I belong there.\\" Wepner later shared this line with Sylvester Stallone who used it in Rocky. On the day of the fight Wepner presented a \\"very sexy\\" blue negligee to his wife and told her to wear it that night in bed since she would be sleeping with the heavyweight champion of the world. On the night of the fight, Mrs. Wepner was wearing the negligee when Wepner returned to their hotel room, after the fight, with twenty three stitches. She asked him: \\"Okay, bigshot...Do I go to Ali's room, or does he come to mine?\\" The Fight Besides his courage and stamina, Wepner had a huge repertoire of \\"fouls and dirty tricks\\", some of which were used in this fight. Prior to the fight Wepner told his manager \\"Ali is the king of boxin'\\", whereupon the manager responded with \\"Yeah, yeah, Chuck, but in the ring you're the king of dirty fighting. You're both royalty.\\" Ali would later complain that Wepner had thrown \\"rabbit punches\\"—punches on the back of the head—on him, and had expressed his displeasure that Tony Perez, the referee, allowed the usage of this tactic. This is despite the fact that Ali threw 6 punches to the back of Wepner's head in the first round. Ali also claimed that the referee incorrectly designated his fall in the ninth round an official knockdown. According to Ali, Wepner had stepped on his foot, and then pushed him causing him to lose his balance and fall. Film and photographic records prove Ali's claim, although Wepner claims it was a genuine knockdown. After knocking down Ali, Wepner went to his corner and told his manager: \\"Start the car up, Al, we're going to the bank, we're millionaires!\\", whereupon the manager told Wepner: \\"You better turn around--your guy's getting up and he looks pissed off.\\" Ali punished Wepner for the rest of the fight culminating with a final flurry of punches in the last round which knocked out Wepner for the first time in his career. Aftermath Ali later commented that Wepner \\"was dirty and fought like a woman.\\" However, Wepner's effort was sufficiently inspiring for Sylvester Stallone to base the character of Rocky on Wepner, and of Apollo Creed on Ali.

History In 1987, Krasnikov considered an infinite set of higher derivative terms acting on the curvature terms and showed that by choosing the coefficients wisely, the propagator would be ghost-free and exponentially suppressed in the ultraviolet regime. Tomboulis (1997) later extended this work. By looking at an equivalent scalar-tensor theory, Biswas, Mazumdar and Siegel (2005) looked at bouncing FRW solutions. In 2011, Biswas, Gerwick, Koivisto and Mazumdar demonstrated that the most general infinite derivative action in 4 dimensions, around constant curvature backgrounds, parity invariant and torsion free, can be expressed by: :S = \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^4x \\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\left(M^2_P R+ R F_1 (\\\\Box) R + R^{\\\\mu u} F_2 (\\\\Box) R_{\\\\mu u} + C^{\\\\mu u\\\\lambda\\\\sigma} F_3 (\\\\Box) C_{\\\\mu u\\\\lambda\\\\sigma} \\\\right) where the F_i (\\\\Box)=\\\\sum^\\\\infty_{n=0} f_{i_n} \\\\left(\\\\Box/M^2\\\\right)^n are functions of the D'Alembert operator \\\\Box=g^{\\\\mu u} abla_\\\\mu abla_ u and a mass scale M, R is the Ricci scalar, R_{\\\\mu u} is the Ricci tensor and C_{\\\\mu u\\\\lambda\\\\sigma} is the Weyl tensor. In order to avoid ghosts, the propagator (which is a combination of the F_i (\\\\Box)s) must be the exponential of an entire function. A lower bound was obtained on the mass scale of IDG using experimental data on the strength of gravity at short distances, as well as by using data on inflation and on the bending of light around the Sun. The GHY boundary terms were found using the ADM 3+1 spacetime decomposition. One can show that the entropy for this theory is finite in various contexts. The effect of IDG on black holes and the propagator was examined by Modesto. Modesto further looked at the renormalisability of the theory, as well as showing that it could generate \\"super-accelerated\\" bouncing solutions instead of a big bang singularity. Calcagni and Nardelli investigated the effect of IDG on the diffusion equation. IDG modifies the way gravitational waves are produced and how they propagate through space. The amount of power radiated away through gravitational waves by binary systems is reduced, although this effect is far smaller than the current observational precision. This theory is shown to be stable and propagates finite number of degrees of freedom. =Avoidance of singularities= This action can produce a bouncing cosmology, by taking a flat FRW metric with a scale factor a(t) = \\\\cosh(\\\\sigma t) or a(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t^2}, thus avoiding the cosmological singularity problem. The propagator around a flat space background was obtained in 2013. This action avoids a curvature singularity for a small perturbation to a flat background near the origin, while recovering the 1/r fall of the GR potential at large distances. This is done using the linearised equations of motion which is a valid approximation because if the perturbation is small enough and the mass scale M is large enough, then the perturbation will always be small enough that quadratic terms can be neglected. It also avoids the Hawking–Penrose singularity in this context. Stability of black hole singularities It was shown that in non-local gravity, Schwarzschild singularities are stable to small perturbations. Further stability analysis of black holes was carried out by Myung and Park. Equations of motion The equations of motion for this action are : \\\\begin{align} T^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} &=P^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}  &= G^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} + 4 G^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} F_1(\\\\Box) R + g^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}R F_1(\\\\Box) R - 4 \\\\left( abla^\\\\alpha abla^\\\\beta - g^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} \\\\Box\\\\right) F_1(\\\\Box) R - 2 \\\\Omega^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}_1 + g^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} \\\\left(\\\\Omega^\\\\sigma_{1\\\\sigma}\\\\right) &\\\\qquad +4 {R^\\\\beta}_\\\\mu R^{\\\\mu\\\\alpha}-g^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} R^{\\\\mu u} F_2(\\\\Box) R_{\\\\mu u} - 4 \\\\left( F_2(\\\\Box)R^{\\\\mu(\\\\beta}\\\\right)^{;\\\\alpha)}_{;\\\\mu}+2 \\\\Box \\\\left(F_2(\\\\Box) R^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} \\\\right)+ 2 g^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} \\\\left(F_2(\\\\Box) R^{\\\\mu u} \\\\right)_{;\\\\mu; u} - 2 \\\\Omega^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}_2 + g^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} \\\\left( \\\\Omega^\\\\sigma_{2\\\\sigma} + \\\\bar{\\\\Omega}_2 \\\\right) - 4 \\\\Delta^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}_2  &\\\\qquad -g^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} C^{\\\\mu u\\\\lambda\\\\sigma} F_3(\\\\Box) C_{\\\\mu u\\\\lambda\\\\sigma} + 4 {C^\\\\alpha}_{\\\\rho\\\\theta\\\\psi} F_3 (\\\\Box)C^{\\\\beta\\\\rho\\\\theta\\\\psi} - 4 \\\\left[ 2 abla_\\\\mu abla_ u + R_{\\\\mu u} \\\\right] F_3(\\\\Box) C^{\\\\beta\\\\mu u\\\\alpha}-2\\\\Omega^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}_3 + g^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} \\\\left(\\\\Omega^\\\\gamma_{3\\\\gamma} + \\\\bar{\\\\Omega}_3 \\\\right) - 8 \\\\Delta^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}_3 \\\\end{align} where :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Omega^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}_1 &= \\\\sum^\\\\infty_{n=1} f_{1_n} \\\\sum^{n-1}_{m=0} abla^\\\\alpha \\\\Box^m R abla^\\\\beta \\\\Box^{n-m-1} R,  \\\\bar{\\\\Omega}_1 &= \\\\sum^\\\\infty_{n=1} f_{1_n} \\\\sum^{n-1}_{m=0} \\\\Box^m R \\\\Box^{n-m} R,  \\\\Omega^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}_2 &= \\\\sum^\\\\infty_{n=1} f_{1_n} \\\\sum^{n-1}_{m=0} abla^\\\\alpha \\\\Box^m {R^\\\\mu}_ u abla^\\\\beta \\\\Box^{n-m-1} {R^ u}_\\\\mu,  \\\\bar{\\\\Omega}_2 &= \\\\sum^\\\\infty_{n=1} f_{1_n} \\\\sum^{n-1}_{m=0} \\\\Box^m {R^\\\\mu}_ u \\\\Box^{n-m} {R^ u}_\\\\mu,  \\\\Delta^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}_2 &= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum^\\\\infty_{n=1} f_{2_n} \\\\sum^{n-1}_{\\\\ell=0} abla_ u \\\\left[ \\\\Box^\\\\ell {R^ u}_\\\\sigma abla^{(\\\\alpha} \\\\Box^{n-\\\\ell-1} R^{\\\\beta)\\\\sigma} - \\\\Box^\\\\ell abla^{(\\\\alpha} {R^nu}_\\\\sigma \\\\Box^{n-\\\\ell-1} R^{\\\\beta)\\\\sigma} \\\\right],  \\\\Omega^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}_3 &= \\\\sum^\\\\infty_{n=1} f_{3_n} \\\\sum^{n-1}_{\\\\ell=0} abla^\\\\alpha \\\\Box^\\\\ell {C^\\\\mu}_{ u\\\\lambda\\\\sigma} abla^\\\\beta \\\\Box^{n-\\\\ell-1} {C_\\\\mu}^{ u\\\\lambda\\\\sigma},  \\\\bar{\\\\Omega}_3 &= \\\\sum^\\\\infty_{n=1} f_{3_n} \\\\sum^{n-1}_{\\\\ell=0} \\\\Box^\\\\ell {C^\\\\mu}_{ u\\\\lambda\\\\sigma} \\\\Box^{n-\\\\ell} {C_\\\\mu}^{ u\\\\lambda\\\\sigma}, \\\\Delta^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}_3 &= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum^\\\\infty_{n=1} f_{3_n} \\\\sum^{n-1}_{\\\\ell=0} abla_ u \\\\left[ \\\\Box^\\\\ell {C^{\\\\lambda u}}_{\\\\sigma\\\\mu} \\\\Box^{n-\\\\ell-1}{C_\\\\lambda}^{(\\\\beta\\\\sigma\\\\mu;\\\\alpha)} - \\\\Box^\\\\ell abla^{(\\\\alpha} C^{\\\\lambda u}_{\\\\sigma\\\\mu} {C_\\\\lambda}^{\\\\beta)\\\\sigma\\\\mu} \\\\right]. \\\\end{align} References Category:Theories of gravitation Category:General relativity Category:Albert Einstein ","title":"Infinite derivative gravity"},{"id":"51860539","text":"Lars Bleker (born 28 June 1994) is a German footballer who plays as a defender for SC Wiedenbrück.

The union was founded in 1833 as the Friendly Society of Operative Stonemasons of England, Ireland and Wales. Initially a loose federation of local unions, it expanded rapidly, reaching 4,000 members and one hundred branches by 1835, and gradually increased its national activity. However, its involvement with the Operative Builders Union led to difficulties, with funds running out and membership dropping to only 2,000. 1836 proved far more successful, membership rebounding and finances settled, but ran into difficulties again in 1842 after disputes relating to the construction of the Houses of Parliament.Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, vol.3, pp.6-11 The union grew slowly through the 1840s, focusing on local disputes and absorbing the remaining local unions - the last being the Bristol Operative Stonemasons' Society, which joined in 1849. However, ite constantly suffered from financial problems. From 1847, it banned masters from membership, limiting itself to employed workers. In 1859 and 1860, it led a one year strike in opposition to \\"The Document\\", and it also held a leading role in the Nine Hours Movement. As a result, by the 1860s, it was the second largest union in the UK, after the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. In its early years, a key objective for the union was banning worked stone from being transported to another town without its consent. After several unsuccessful attempts to introduce this rule in parts of Lancashire, it was successful in Sheffield in 1862, and by 1867 was able to apply the policy nationally. As a result, by the start of the 1870s, it was the most influential union in the building trades. However, an 1877 strike for a wage increase of 10d per hour was defeated, leading to a drop in membership, which fell from 27,200 to 12,600, and there were subsequent wage cuts and increases in hours instituted by employers. The union's membership rose again in the 1890s, peaking at 19,682 in 1899, but fell to only 7,055 by 1910. By this point, its policy was in favour of a single union for the building trades. At the start of 1921, it merged with the London Order of Bricklayers and the Manchester Unity of Bricklayers to form the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers.

He was particularly influenced by his Geology teacher, Prof John Walter Gregory. He graduated BSc with distinction in 1914.http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH25469&type;=P His first employment after graduation was as an explosives chemist. Despite this apparent appropriate role his inexperience led him to more standard service during the First World War, during which he served as a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers in Mesopotamia. In 1918 he was transferred to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company to work as a geologist in relation to fuel supplies. He remained in this role after the war ended, working mainly in Persia and Iraq, and being responsible for sourcing many of the oil-fields still in production today. During this period he also mapped an area of 30,000 square miles in the Zagros Mountain Range. In the 1930s he was in great demand from China to South America. In 1938 Oxford University offered him a post lecturing in Structural Geology, being seen as the foremost expert in his field. In 1931 Glasgow University awarded him an honorary doctorate (DSc). In 1934 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were John Smith Flett, Edward Battersby Bailey, Murray Macgregor, and William McLintock. He enlisted in the Army Reserves at the outset of the Second World War and was called up to work as a geologist for the Admiralty in 1943. He retired in 1959 and died in Oxford on 30 July 1972.

During the 1890s he was a leading figure in the intellectual life of British Bombay. Life Born at Partick, Lanarkshire, on 4 October 1846, he was a younger son among the six children of John McLeod Campbell and his wife Mary Campbell. Of his three brothers, the eldest, Donald (d. 1909), was rector of Oakford, Devon. Campbell was educated at Glasgow Academy and Glasgow University, graduating M.A. in 1866. Passing the Indian Civil Service examination in 1867, he went out to Bombay in November 1869, and served as an assistant collector. Two of his brothers lived with him in Bombay, John McLeod Campbell (d. 1888) of the Bombay civil service, and Robert Story Campbell, a merchant. From April to August 1877 Campbell was on famine work in the Kaladgi district. From April 1880 to near the close of 1881 he held successively the posts of municipal commissioner of Bombay, under-secretary to government in the political, judicial, and educational departments, and collector of Bombay. Campbell was made C.I.E. in January 1885, and going home on his first furlough in that year was created hon. LL.D. of Glasgow University. After serving as collector of various districts, Campbell was from November 1891 stationed at Bombay as collector of land revenue, customs, and opium. In 1895 and 1897 he acted also there as commissioner of customs, salt, opium, and abkari. At times he served also as chairman of the port trust. Campbell was recalled from furlough early in 1897 to aid in measures against the third plague pandemic. In June 1897 he succeeded General Sir William Gatacre as chairman of a new plague committee at Bombay, and was made K.C.I.E.. The committee's measures of sanitation provoked rioting and attacks against officers on plague duty (22 June 1897). There was famine in the country and thousands of refugees in Bombay. Campbell encouraged voluntary co-operation in inspection and other work. In June 1898 the plague administration was restored to the municipality. Last years On 29 April 1898 Campbell left Bombay in bad health, resigning, on the expiry of his furlough, in April 1900. Residing with his brother Robert at his father's old home, Achnashie, Rosneath, Dumbartonshire, he found recreation in gardening. He died unmarried at Achnashie on 26 May 1903, and was buried in Roseneath churchyard, beside his parents. Legacy A memorial tablet on the ruined wall of the old Rosneath church paid tribute to the example set by Campbell during the plague outbreak in Bombay, attributing to it his premature death. Friends also founded a gold medal, conferred triennially by the Bombay branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, for work on Indian folklore, history, or ethnology. The first medal was presented on 1 March 1909 to Aurel Stein, for his Ancient Khotan. Works Solapur district map from the Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency In June 1873 Campbell was asked to taken on the compilation of the Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency. By August 1884 the statistical accounts alone occupied 27 volumes averaging 500 pages each. William Wilson Hunter as editor of The Imperial Gazetteer of India largely based the Bombay portions on Campbell's work. Campbell completed his Bombay Gazetteer at the end of 1901, in 34 volumes, and 26 sections; he himself wrote in those dealing with ethnology. In 1904 Reginald Edward Enthoven added an index volume, and updated some earlier statistics; in 1910 Stephen Meredyth Edwardes added three further volumes on the history of the town and island of Bombay. Campbell collected material on Indian history and folklore. He published a history of Mandogarh in the Journal of the Bombay Branch, Royal Asiatic Society (vol. xix. 1895–7); papers in the proceedings of the Bombay Anthropological Society; and studies of demonology, under the title of Notes on the Spirit Basis of Belief and Custom, in the Indian Antiquary from 1894.

From 1950 to 1957 Reutter manufactured about 100 convertibles, mostly based on the Volkswagen Beetle. The sales price was 8,892 DM. The body was handmade by tapping metal sheets on a template. The doors were made in a pressing shop. Other companies like DKW were supplied. When in 1955 the Karmann Ghia was mass-produced, the company could no longer compete, and its product was discontinued. The amount of production was limited, but precise numbers are uncertain. Changing their business model to rebuilding vehicle bodies allowed the company to survive at the address in Augustenstraße, Stuttgart where Reutter had been. About 15 of the DKW Monza cars were made by Dannenhauer & Stauss. Ostensibly, a grand total of about 80 of the DKW Monza cars were made, albeit by different companies.

It was their 31st consecutive season in the top flight of Swiss football after they won promotion during the season 1945–46. They played their home games in the St. Jakob Stadium. René Theler was voted as new chairman at the AGM and took over from Félix Musfeld, who had been the club chairman over the previous six seasons. Overview Helmut Benthaus was first team manager for the twelth consecutive season. There were only a few changes in the team squad this seson. Detlev Lauscher joined from 1. FC Köln. Lauscher had played five seasons for 1. FC Köln in the German first division, helping the club finish as runners-up in the league and cup during 1973. Jean-Pierre Maradan joined from lower tier Grenchen but quickly became a key player. Again Benthaus relied upon the young players who had come up from the reserve team when needed in the first team. Basel played a total of 56 games in their 1976–77 season. 33 in the domestic league, two in the Swiss Cup, two in the Swiss League Cup, four in the Cup of the Alps, four in the 1976–77 UEFA Cup and 11 were friendly matches. The team scored a total of 134 goals and conceded 80. Basel won eight of their friendly games, drew two and lost one of them. The Swiss Football Association had reformed the Swiss football league system that year reducing the number of teams in the Nationalliga A from 14 to 12 and increasing the Nationalliga B teams from 14 to 16. The Nationalliga A season 1976–77 was contested by the first 11 teams from the previous season and the sole promoted team AC Bellinzona. The champions would qualify for the 1977–78 European Cup and the Swiss Cup winners would qualify for 1977–78 Cup Winners' Cup. The UEFA modified the entry rules for Switzerland, therefore, this season three teams would qualify for the 1977–78 UEFA Cup. The Nationalliga A was played in two stages. The qualification phase was played by all teams in a double round-robin and, after completion, divided into two groups. The first six teams contended in the championship group (with half of the points obtained in the qualification as bonus) and the positions seventh to twelfth contended the relegation group. Basel finished the qualification phase in second position with 33 points from 22 games and so entered the championship group with a bonus of 17. At the end of the championship phase Servette and Basel were level on 29 points. They therefore had to play a play- off for champions. This play-off was held at the Wankdorf Stadium in Bern in front of 55,000 supporters. Basel won the match 2–1, their goals being scored by Walter Mundschin and Arthur von Wartburg. Basel were awarded the championship title and qualified for the 1977–78 European Cup. Servette, Zürich and Grasshopper Club qualified for the 1977–78 UEFA Cup. In the Swiss Cup Basel won away from home against lower tier Fribourg in the round of 32 and in the round of 16 were drawn away against Xamax but were defeated. In the Swiss League Cup they won away from home against lower tier Grenchen. Then in the round of 16 were drawn away against Luzern and here they were defeated. Young Boys won the competition this season. In the first round of the 1976–77 UEFA Cup Basel were drawn against Northern Ireland team Glentoran F.C.. Basel won 5–3 on aggregate. In the second round they were drawn against Spanish team Athletic Bilbao. After a draw in the 1st leg, they but were defeated 1–3, thus 2–4 on aggregate.

It was released in connection with the Washington Conference on Holocaust Era Assets, held in Washington, D.C., United States, on 3 December 1998.  The Conference  The conference was hosted by the United States Department of State and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. It assembled participants from a 1995 New York symposium, The Spoils of War—World War II and Its Aftermath: The Loss, Reappearance, and Recovery of Cultural Property, along with others, and built on the Nazi Gold conference which had been held in London in December 1997. The conference was held from November 30 to December 3, 1998 and was attended by representatives of 44 countries and 13 nongovernmental organizations, art museums and auction houses. The 1998 conference's aim was to discuss Jewish losses in particular, including artworks, books, and archives, as well as insurance claims and other types of assets. 44 governments, including the reunified Germany, sent delegates, as did thirteen international non-governmental organizations. The conference organizer was the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Economic, Business, and Agricultural Affairs, Stuart E. Eizenstat, who had previously been United States Ambassador to the European Union, and its chairman was Judge Abner Mikva. U.S. Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright gave the opening address.  The Principles  The statement includes eleven numbered principles, prefixed: The principles are: # Art that had been confiscated by the Nazis and not subsequently restituted should be identified. # Relevant records and archives should be open and accessible to researchers, in accordance with the guidelines of the International Council on Archives. # Resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the Nazis and not subsequently restituted. # In establishing that a work of art had been confiscated by the Nazis and not subsequently restituted, consideration should be given to unavoidable gaps or ambiguities in the provenance in light of the passage of time and the circumstances of the Holocaust era. # Every effort should be made to publicize art that is found to have been confiscated by the Nazis and not subsequently restituted in order to locate its pre-War owners or their heirs. # Efforts should be made to establish a central registry of such information. # Pre-War owners and their heirs should be encouraged to come forward and make known their claims to art that was confiscated by the Nazis and not subsequently restituted. # If the pre-War owners of art that is found to have been confiscated by the Nazis and not subsequently restituted, or their heirs, can be identified, steps should be taken expeditiously to achieve a just and fair solution, recognizing this may vary according to the facts and circumstances surrounding a specific case. # If the pre-War owners of art that is found to have been confiscated by the Nazis, or their heirs, can not be identified, steps should be taken expeditiously to achieve a just and fair solution. # Commissions or other bodies established to identify art that was confiscated by the Nazis and to assist in addressing ownership issues should have a balanced membership. # Nations are encouraged to develop national processes to implement these principles, particularly as they relate to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms for resolving ownership issues.

Serravo, ME Clark - Denv. UL Rev., 1992Conceptual Ambiguities in the Insanity Defense: State v. Wilson and the New Wrongfulness Standard, BV Ranade, Conn. L. Rev., 1997Criminal Law - Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012, Wolters Kluwer Law & Business; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder, , The question before the court was whether \\"incapable of distinguishing right from wrong\\" refers to distinguishing between moral right and moral wrong, vs. being able to distinguish what is legal from what is not legal. The court concluded: :\\"that the term 'wrong' in the statutory definition of insanity refers to moral wrong.\\" The court also found that the standard of moral wrongness was an objective standard, not a subjective standard. The court wrote \\"the phrase 'incapable of distinguishing right from wrong' refers to a person's cognitive ability, due to a mental disease or defect, to distinguish right from wrong as measured by a societal standard of morality... [and] does not refer to a purely personal and subjective standard of morality.\\" The court also examined the relationship between the legal test of insanity and a deific decree, the belief that an act is not wrong because God ordered it. Robert Pasqual Serravo http://law.justia.com/cases/colorado/court-of-appeals/1990/89ca0318-0.html was reading his Bible then went upstairs and stabbed his wife in the back. She did not die, and woke up. He told her an intruder stabbed her and he called for emergency assistance. When police arrived, he told them he left the garage door open, heard his front door slam, went upstairs to check on his wife, and found her bleeding. His wife later found letters written by Serravo admitting to the stabbing, confronted him, and he explained that God told him to sever their marriage by stabbing her, and called police who arrested and charged him. Serravo's attorney raised the insanity defense. The prosecution forensic psychiatrist found Serravo sane because while he believed his act was justified and so was not morally wrong because of a delusional system, he was aware his act was contrary to law. One defense psychiatrist found that Serravo may have been able to tell what was or was not legally wrong, but his delusion made it impossible to tell moral right from wrong. Other defense psychiatrists found that his delusions made him unable to tell right from wrong, in accordance with standards of society. The question on appeal was whether \\"incapable of distinguishing right from wrong\\" refers to distinguishing between moral right and moral wrong, vs. being able to distinguish what is legal from what is not legal.

Despite its name, it was never restricted to Manchester, instead operating throughout the United Kingdom.

The by-election was caused by the death on 4 June 1933 of independent MP Dr Herbert Basedow, who had regained the seat at the 1933 election less than two months prior. He had previously held the seat from 1927 to 1930. The seat was contested by four candidates: solicitor Reginald Rudall for the governing Liberal and Country League, former MP Thomas Edwards, who listed his occupation as \\"out of business\\", for the Parliamentary Labor Party, labourer Leslie McMullin for the Labor Party, and farmer Lindsay Yelland as an independent. All four candidates had contested Barossa at the 1933 election. The by-election was held, as with the 1933 election, in the aftermath of the 1932 Labor split, in which the state Labor Party had split into three separate and competing parties. Edwards had been an incumbent at the time of the split, and had followed the Cabinet into the separate Parliamentary Labor Party when they were expelled over their response to the Great Depression, before his defeat by Basedow in 1933. A rumoured candidate from the third Labor splinter, the Lang Labor Party, did not emerge. The largest booths were at Gawler (987 votes), Tanunda (774 votes), Gawler South (685 votes), Salisbury (326 votes), Angaston (375 votes) and Willaston (322 votes). There were also booths at Abattoirs, Blanchetown, Cockatoo Valley, Dublin, Enfield, Gawler Blocks, Gaza, Keyneton, Lights Pass, Loos, Long Plains, Lyndoch, Mallala, Mount McKenzie, Moculta, Northfield, Nuriootpa, Onetree Hill, Punyelroo, Red Banks, Rosedale, Roseworthy, Rowlands Flat, Sandleton, Sedan, Smithfield, St Kilda, Stockwell, Stonefield, Towitta, Truro, Two Wells, Virginia, Wasleys, Wild Horse Plains, Williamstown and Windsor. The election campaign was described by the Bunyip newspaper as \\"quiet in character\\". Seats in the multi-member Barossa electorate had changed control several times over the previous decade; The Advertiser noted that Barossa \\"had never been a safe district for any party\\". A number of prominent figures featured in the campaign: Premier Richard Layton Butler, Minister of Agriculture Percy Blesing and Attorney-General Shirley Jeffries campaigned for Rudall, official Labor leader Andrew Lacey campaigned for McMullin, and Parliamentary Labor leader Robert Richards for Edwards. The by-election was resoundingly won by Rudall, who polled 48% of the primary vote. Edwards and McMullin recorded small improvements from their general election vote in the absence of competing candidates from their respective parties, while independent candidate Yelland improved his vote significantly. Rudall won an overwhelming majority of booths, including Labor-leaning Gawler; Edwards topped the vote in Cockatoo Valley, Mt McKenzie, Tanunda, Willaston and Williamstown, McMullin in Blanchetown, Enfield and Gawler South, and Yelland in Abattoirs and Gaza. Many commentators in the aftermath of the by-election highlighted the ongoing political impact of the Labor split. Rudall continued as an MP until 1955, serving in both houses of parliament, and becoming a long-serving minister in the government of Thomas Playford IV.

His career has encompassed ceramics, poetry, social commentary, opera and musical theatre. His focus of the last few years is on works of non-fiction relating to politics and monetary reform. Early life, family and education Born in London in 1951, the son of writer Nicholas Mosley, and grandson of politician Oswald Mosley, Ivo Mosley went to Bryanston School before studying Japanese at New College, Oxford. In 2007 he also completed an MA in musical theatre at Goldsmiths College, London. In 1977 he married the artist Xanthe Oppenheimer. Ceramics Whilst studying, Mosley became fascinated by Japanese pottery and porcelain. On completing his degree in 1972, he purchased a kiln and started making pots. Based in London, this was his career until 1987, and he became known for his bold use of colour and the development of new glazing techniques. Not unlike other Oxbridge educated ceramicists such as Edmund de Waal, Mosley combined pottery with writing; he was asked to write articles on his techniques of firing and glazing, and had an ongoing project translating Japanese poetry. Mosley's ceramics have been exhibited at The National Theatre, Liberty of London and elsewhere and sold through Designers Guild. Poetry His Japanese studies inspired Mosley with a profound interest in Japanese poetry. On graduating he began translating the waka poet Kakinomoto no Hitomaro's work for The Dublin Magazine then under the editorship of John Ryan. In 1993 Frontier Publishing published his The Green Book of Poetry, a poetry anthology of over 300 poems from around the world, originally written in 30 different languages in defence of nature. Mosley provided commentary and many translations, but the poets most heavily featured are the Australian ecopoet Judith Wright, and Brendan Kennelly, who once said \\"Poetry is the ultimate democracy\\". In 1996 Harper SanFrancisco re-published the anthology as Earth Poems: Poems from Around the World to Honor the Earth, updated and including eighty new and contemporary poems and commentary. Mosley's own original poems have been featured in journals and national newspapers. In 1999 he was appointed Poetry Editor at the Journal of Consciousness Studies.http://www.imprint.co.uk/jcs-editorial-board/ Writing In 2000, Mosley's first work of non-fiction, Dumbing Down, a collection of essays and interviews on the concept of dumbing down, was published on Imprint Academic. Contributors to the publication include Michael Oakshott, Ravi Shankar, Phillip Rieff, Robert Brustein, Roger Deakin, Adam Boulton, Peter Randall- Page, Claire Fox, John Ziman and Jaron Lanier. He followed this in 2003 with Democracy, Fascism and the New World Order, and a second book about democracy, In The Name of the People published by Imprint Academic in 2013. In this book Mosley clarifies the distinction between representative government and rule by the people, along with the former's dangers, citing works such as The History of the Origins of Representative Government (1821/22) by François Guizot, later prime minister of France. The long chapter How Debt Came to Rule the World charges elected representative governments with betraying the people by allowing banks to create the money supply, recommends Bank Credit by C.A. Phillips (1920) as the clearest extant explanation of the current international banking system, and quotes heavily from Henry Calvert Simons' Economic Policy for a Free Society (University of Chicago Press, 1951). Mosley's most recent book, Bank Robbery, has been serialised on two monetary reform websites, The Cobden Centre, and Positive Money. Ivo Mosley has been a vocal critic of his grandfather's fascist politics, often commenting publicly on the \\"evil legacy\\" of fascism. As a journalist he has written widely and internationally on topics including democracy, religion, multiculturalism, science, and economics. Mosley has also written articles for national newspapers, including the Telegraph, the Catholic Herald, Resurgence, and the Times Higher Education Supplement, mostly reviewing works of non-fiction. Opera and Theatre Since the late 1990s, Mosley has written a number of pieces for theatre, film and opera including ‘Danny’s Dream’ (1st performance: Joseph Rowntree Theatre, York, 1998) ‘Science’ (Bridewell Theatre, London 2002), and ‘The London Women’s Buskers Orchestra Meet for the End of the World’ (Battersea Arts Centre, 2008). Personal Justice is a short thriller film (2005) which Mosley wrote and scored. Mad King Suibhne, an opera for which he wrote the libretto, was produced by Bury Court Opera and had its first performance in 2017 at Messum's Wiltshire.

It was described in 1902 by the Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger. It is of limited importance as a food fish in subsistence fisheries and its conservation status is Least Concern. Naming and taxonomy Microthrissa royauxi was named by George Albert Boulenger in 1902 from specimens taken in the Ubangi. Its name is from micro small and thrissa from the Greek word for a type of anchovy. The specific name royauxi is in honor of Capitaine Louis Joseph Royaux (1866-1936), who led the expedition that collected the type specimen and supplied indigenous names of many of the species the expedition collected. It is the type species of the genus Microthrissa. Description Microthrissa royauxi is a small fish with a rather deep body, the height of the body being roughly a third of the length with a fairly pointed snout, lacking a projecting lower jaw. It has strongly keeled scutes 1 or 2 rows before the base of the first pectoral fin ray. In this and other species of West African freshwater clupeid the jaw anatomy is important in identification and this species has rather narrow jaws compared to its relatives. The maximum length is 9.9 cm,. although 8 cm appears to be the average length. Distribution Microthrissa royauxi is found in the middle Congo River basin, including the Ubangi system but not the Kasai, it has been recorded from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Congo, Central African Republic and Cameroon. This species has been recorded from Pool Malebo (Stanley Pool) and the central Congo River basin, as well as the Lualaba River at Kindu. Evolution The clupeids are largely marine, the sub-family that Microthrissa royauxi is a member of, the Pellonulinae, are common in southern and western Africa, for example Limnothrissa miodon in Lake Tanganyika and Potamothrissa acuitirostris in the Congo Basin. Molecular phylogenetic reconstructions indicate that the ancestors of these freshwater Pellonulines colonised West Africa 25–50 million years ago, at the end of a major marine incursion in the region. Pellonuline herring subsequently speciated in an evolutionary radiation in West Africa, and spread across the continent and colonising its freshwater bodies. Habitat Microthrissa royauxi is a pelagic fish of large rivers. Fisheries Microthrissa royauxi makes a small contribution to the catches of local fishermen, it is caught mainly by subsistence fishermen.

Also praising cinematography and music, she criticised the writing for lacking punch dialogues and effective humour. Concluding she opined, \\"Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas is definitely one of your run-of-the-mill love stories, but it makes you smile, cry, laugh and brings a sense of freshness.\\" Gaurang Chauhan of Times Now rated it 2.5 stars out of 5, stated that \\"Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas is a visually stunning film with some good tunes but the movie somehow misses the mark due to its overlong length and a mediocre screenplay.

It was founded by the Greek-born harpsichordist and singer Lina Lalandi (1920–2012) and the English musicologist Jack Westrup who were co-directors during the festival's early years in Oxford.Daily Telegraph (12 July 2012).\\"Lina Lalandi\\". Retrieved 4 October 2016. In 1971, Lalandi became the sole director and the festival was primarily based in London. The festival's early programmes had been largely based on Bach's music—the St John Passion conducted by Karl Richter was a highlight of one of the early festivals. However, from the outset the festival also presented music by modern composers. Lalandi wrote in 1963 that the festival would also include \\"20th-century composers whose way of thinking is nearer to [Bach's] than to that of the Romantic age.\\"Rubinoff, Kailan (2013). \\"A revolution in sheep's wool stockings: Early music and '1968'\\" in Beate Kutschke and Barley Norton (eds.)

Stravinsky conducted a concert of his own works at the 1964 festival, and the festival went on to present the first UK performances of works by Xenakis, Stockhausen, Ligeti and Messiaen.Kennedy, Michael and Kennedy, Joyce Bourne (1996) \\"English Bach Festival\\".

History and classification P. oligocenica is known from a single ant found in Russia. The specimen was described from a compression fossil preserved in diatomite deposits of the Bol’shaya Svetlovodnaya site. The site is exposed on the bank of Barachek Creek upstream from the creeks confluence with the Bol’shaya Svetlovodnaya River in the Pozharsky District, on the Pacific Coast of Russia. The fossil-bearing rocks preserve possibly Priabonian plants and animals which lived in and around a small lake near a volcano. The site has been attributed to either the Maksimovka or Salibez Formations and compared to the Bembridge Marls and Florissant Formation, both of which are Priabonian in age. At the time of description, the holotype male specimen, number PIN 3429/1112 was preserved in the A. A. Borissiak Paleontological Institute collections, part of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The fossil was first described by the trio of paleomyrmecologists Gennady Dlussky, Alexandr Rasnitsyn and Ksenia Perfilieva. In the type description, Dlussky, Rasnitsyn and Perfilieva named the species P. oligocenica, with the specific epithet derived \\"Oligocene\\" the possible age of the site. At the time of description, only two other Pachycondyla species males had been described from fossils; the males of both P. baltica and P. succinea are known from fossils entombed in Eocene age Baltic amber. P. oligocenica is distinguished from both baltic amber species in that the holotype male is larger than the other males, males of those species with bodies ranging between long. P. oligocenica is one of two Pachycondyla species that were described by Dlussky, Rasnitsyn and Perfilieva from Bol’shaya Svetlovodnaya, the other species P. aberrans being described from a partial queen or male. P. succinea male Description Though incomplete, the P. oligocenica male has an estimated body length of , while the alitrunk is . The head has an almost square outline, being slightly shorter than it is wide, and the rear edge is rounded. The large oval shaped eyes convex in shape, protruding slightly from the head capsule. Neither of the mandibles have any teeth along the edges, and they are placed far apart on the head, preventing touching when they close. The antennae are not preserved from the holotype, so the structure and length was unknown at the time of description. The forewing has a length of with the veins fully enclosing and forming the cells 1+2r, 3r, mcu, and rm. The rm cell is not present in the forewing of P. aberrans, distinguishing the two species.

He played college basketball and football at Western Kentucky, and was signed by the Seattle Seahawks as an undrafted free agent in 2016. Starting in 2018, Fant was used as a hybrid tight end on tackle-eligible plays for Seattle. High school career Fant attended Warren Central High School where he lettered and started all four years in basketball. As a junior, he earned second team All- State honors. As a senior, he recorded 62.2% from the field and led the team with 75 blocks, averaged 21.5 points-per-game and 11.7 rebounds-per-game. For the season, he earned first team All-State honors. When he graduated, he was the schools all-time leader in rebounds (1,039) and third in points (1,805). He was rated as a three-star recruit by Rivals.com and was listed on their Top 150 as the 150th best senior in the nation. College career After high school, Fant attended Western Kentucky University, where he majored in recreation. =Basketball career= As a freshman in 2011–2012, he appeared in 31 games with 24 starts. He averaged 26.4 minutes-per-game. He averaged 10.4 points, 6.1 rebounds, and had a total of 37 blocks and 29 steals. He also led the team in field goal percentage (.476). His 321 points scored ranked seventh all-time for a freshman in school history. As a sophomore in 2012–2013 he averaged 12.8 points and 6.6 rebounds-per-game. He shot 48.2% from the field going 163-for-338. After averaging 13.0 points and 7.5 rebounds-per-game he was named to the All-Sun Belt Conference Tournament team. He was named All-Sun Belt third team. In 2013–2014 as a junior, he averaged 13.3 points and 6.6 rebounds-per-game. He finished second on the team in scoring and led the team in rebounding for the second straight season. He finished seventh in the conference in rebounding. He led the team in field goal percentage with (.530), which was good for fifth in the conference. He was named to the All- Sun Belt third team. As a senior in 2014–2015, he led the team in rebounding with 8.4 rebounds-per-game which was good for third in conference. He averaged 13.8 points-per-game, a career high. He recorded 12 double-doubles, second most in Conference USA. He was named All-Conference for the third consecutive season with second-team honors. =Football career= Throughout his first four years at Western Kentucky, friends and coaches urged Fant to join the Hilltoppers football team but he refused. He received letters from multiple NFL teams in spring 2015 asking if he were interested in giving professional football a chance but disregarded the letters and threw them away. Fant decided to transition to football after weighing his options of either playing basketball overseas in Poland or attempting a football career. With a wife and child to care for, he chose to play football. Western Kentucky tight ends Tyler Higbee and Devin Scott helped him learn the tight end position and tight ends coach Ryan Wallace also worked with him. He bulked up from 250 lbs to 296 lbs for football. Fant also said that he studied many tapes of another basketball-to-football convert, tight end Jimmy Graham. Fant used his fifth year of eligibility to join the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team as a tight end. For the season, he appeared in two games, recording one reception for seven yards, as well as two tackles. Professional career Fant was expected to go undrafted after playing only a single year of playing tight end at the collegiate football level. Due to his limited experience, Fant was not one of the 15 collegiate tight ends to attend the NFL Scouting Combine. On March 29, 2016, he attended Western Kentucky's pro day, along with Brandon Doughty, Tyler Higbee, Prince Charles Iworah, and 11 other prospects. Fant was listed as an offensive lineman during WKU's pro day and weighed 296 lbs, 26 lbs heavier than his playing weight of 270 lbs during the season. He impressed the Seahawks' co-director of player personnel Trent Kirchner with his athletic ability and worked out at multiple positions including: linebacker, defensive end, defensive tackle, tight end, and offensive tackle. Although he didn't have game film, he was able to impress enough with his athletic ability and size that the Seahawks signed him solely based on a single workout. Offensive line coach Tom Cable had to make the decision between Fant and another offensive line prospect but chose Fant because he was a \\"long-armed athlete\\". =Seattle Seahawks= 2016 Fant signed with the Seattle Seahawks as an undrafted free agent on May 6, 2016. Throughout training camp he learned the offensive tackle position quickly and did well enough to win the backup left tackle job behind Bradley Sowell to begin the regular season. He made his professional regular-season debut on October 23, 2016, and played 24 snaps after Sowell sprained his knee during the 6–6 tie with the Arizona Cardinals. He made his first career start during Week 8 against the New Orleans Saints after Sowell was still unable to play due to injury. Fant committed two clipping penalties in his first two starts and also committed a false start. He is the third player that Tom Cable has successfully transitioned into an offensive lineman with little or no collegiate experience at the position. The Seahawks' starting right tackle, Garry Gilliam, was undrafted with only a single year of collegiate experience as a lineman and started in seven months. The first player was J. R. Sweezy, who had no experience, playing only defensive end in college. He transitioned to guard successfully in five months. Fant is the most dramatic change, earning the starting left tackle position in less than 20 months. On November 13, 2016, he made his third career start against the New England Patriots and was credited with not committing a single assignment error in the Seahawks' 31–24 victory. He ultimately did well enough in his first four career starts that he remained the starter at left tackle once Sowell returned from his injury. He played the last ten consecutive games of the season as the Seattle Seahawks' starting left tackle and finished his rookie season appearing in 14 games with ten starts. 2017 In the second game of the 2017 preseason, Fant tore his ACL and was ruled out for the season. He was placed on injured reserve on September 2, 2017. 2018 After rookie tight end Will Dissly got injured in a week 4 matchup with the Arizona Cardinals, Fant started to play an offensive tackle/tight end hybrid role. He would line up as a sixth offensive lineman, either on the line itself or outside, and declare himself an eligible receiver. Fant had great success in this new role and helped the 2018 Seahawks achieve the number one ranked rushing offense in the league. On December 10, 2018, in a week 13 Monday Night Football matchup against the Minnesota Vikings, Fant recorded his first career reception, a 9-yard pass from quarterback Russell Wilson. 2019 Fant continued to function as a hybrid lineman for the Seahawks in 2019. He also functioned as the primary backup offensive tackle, filling in for an injured Duane Brown during parts of the season.https://seahawkswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/24/seahawks-miss-having- george-fant-line-up-at-tight-end/ On December 2, 2019, in a Monday Night Football matchup against the Minnesota Vikings, Fant garnered attention for helping the Seahawks rush for a season-high 218 yards in a 37-30 win. He reported as an eligible receiver on 42 plays during the game and lined up at multiple positions along the line.https://12thmanrising.com/2019/12/02/seahawks-mvp-game-12-george-fant/ =New York Jets= On April 23, 2020, Fant signed a three-year, $30 million contract with the New York Jets. Personal life Fant is married to former Western Kentucky women's basketball player Chastity Gooch and has two children with her. His son, Jayden Fant, was born shortly before his workout with the Seahawks and his second son was born in the spring of 2017.

The budget of the FIRE-project was ca. 17 million euros, most of which was funded through reimbursements of the Russian national debt to Finland as scientific equipment and services. Seismic probing was carried out on four profiles across Finland. The FIRE 1 and 2 transect the southern and central Finland from northeast to southwest and FIRE 3 from east to west. FIRE 4 transects the bedrock of northern Finland from north to south. The seismic reflection results have been used to refine the interpretations of deep crustal structures of the Baltic Shield. The results from the experiment have been released into open access in 2017 under the auspices of the OpenFIRE project by the Institute of Seismology at the University of Helsinki.

Professional career Before the release of Counter-Strike : Global Offensive in 2012, the Slovak played both CS and CS:S professionally. He was first introduced to Counter-Strike by his brother, who bought the game on a CD when it was not well known at the time. He liked the game, so he kept playing it and developing as a player and some time later he found himself a team and took part in his first LAN tournaments. Due to the low number of CS events at his home soil, he decided to switch onto CS:S. He had been playing for the ranks of Reason Gaming for two years. This led him to a lot of victories while playing CS:S. Despite having been offered a spot from a number of top European teams, GuardiaN switched back to CS and started playing for such squads as IQFIGHTERS, DEFEATERS, Corecell, and SGC as well as for his national team, Slovakia. In addition, he was frequently honored with a number of different awards (both as a team member and as a player). GuardiaN moved on to CS:GO in the middle of 2012. He played for myDGB.net, ePz, TCM- Gaming and 3DMAX before playing well in the Virtus.pro roster. He joined the ranks of Natus Vincere in December 2013.

He is recognized for the creation of (and holds the patent for) Vertical Ecosystems, an innovative concept in the design and construction of green walls . He is the author of the Definitive Guide of the Vertical Garden.  Biography  Ignacio Solano is the founder of the company Paisajismo Urbano, which designs and constructions green walls, green facades, green roofs and other kinds of bioconstruction. He discovered his passion for the nature at an early age. Since childhood, Solano watched very carefully the behavior of small animals, especially amphibians and reptiles. His interest in plants grew from that hobby, and his first experiments with them were miniature recreations of natural habitats of these animals. Thus, he became interested in botany and understanding how plants relate to each other and their environment. He specialized in biological interactions and is dedicated to traveling through jungles around the world to investigate and implement his knowledge. He traveled through the ecosystems of Mexico, North Argentina, Madagascar island, Reunion Islands, Bolivian Chapare, Colombian Choco, Ecuador, Costa Rica and Chile. These expeditions had a great influence on his work methodology. In 2010, Solano traveled to the jungle of Madagascar to study the behavior of mycorrhizal fungi. The vegetation of this island evolved at a different pace from the African continent, resulting in a very high percentage of endemic species. While there, Solano made the discovery that allowed him to consolidate the concept of Vertical ecosystem: a solution based on fungi and bacteria which gets a much higher rate of success when applied to vertical gardens. This innovation, coupled with his professional experience and testing performed in his laboratories, allowed him to develop and patent his own system of vertical gardening. With his technology, more than a hundred projects have been developed all around the world. In 2012, Solano began teaching courses on vertical gardening. His goal when he became a teacher was both to share the knowledge he acquired during years of work and research and to start creating an international network of Vertical Ecosystems builders. Since then he has trained more than 400 students. In 2016, he published his first book: Definitive Guide of the Vertical Garden. This is a manual that includes the technical aspects of vertical gardening and situations that may occur during the process of construction vertical gardens. It also includes a guide of species that have proven to work in vertical gardening.  Patented system  Ignacio Solano is author and owner of the patented system f + p for gardening facades. In turn, he is the inventor of the concept of Vertical Ecosystem, which includes vertical gardens and plant facades that have been developed with this system. Vertical Ecosystems are based on the conception that vertical gardens resemble the natural ecosystems in their composition and in the way they function (especially those composed by epiphytes). They are composed of different plants that comprise the natural ecosystems, and so they resemble the relationships between the plants and the natural microorganisms. Therefore, conventional gardening concepts can not be applied for vertical gardening. In the words of Solano, \\"making a vertical garden is not just putting plants on a wall.\\" Ignacio Solano's patent corrects and perfects the concept of vertical garden designed by French landscape architect Patrick Blanc. The result is a hydroponic system, in which is used a phytogenerant material, the texture, porosity and absorptive capacity of which are suitable to perform the function of substrate. The system is fully automated, and environmental factors, water chemistry and the status of the plants are monitored by automation control. An automated irrigation system continuously supplies the water and micronutrients the plants need. These improvements enhance the environmental benefits of vertical gardens: generate oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide, trap dust and heavy metals, serve as thermal insulation (saving on air conditioning in buildings) and reduce noise pollution.

Research  Much of the knowledge of Ignacio Solano on plant behavior and relationships between species comes from his experience as a researcher in jungles around the world. In 1998 he made his first trip to Mexico, and since then has gone through different ecosystems. In his travels he is dedicated to find out how plants behave under different conditions and to collect small samples of species. Ignacio Solano, Reunion Islands Highlights his studies of epiphytes plants of tropical understory, as well as the discoveries made in the jungles of Madagascar, which allowed him to develop a formula based on microorganisms that ensures the survival of the vertical gardens.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. Description and history The Beck and Beck Granite Shed stands on the southeast side of Granite Street, across the railroad tracks from downtown Barre. The shed consists of a long rectangular single-story wood-frame structure, oriented perpendicular to the street, to which a number of additions and connected structures have been added. The main structure is long and wide, and is covered by a gabled roof with a band of clerestory windows. Between this structure and the street is an attached office building presenting a saltbox profile to the street, and to its left is a vernacular shed-roof building. Roughly midway down the length of the main structure is a projecting section to the right. In the crook created by this projection is a long gabled building, which is connected to the main shed by a hyphen. with The main shed was built in 1933, replacing an older horseshoe- shaped granite shed. The Beck and Beck Company, its builder, was established in 1898 by members of the Beck family, German immigrants who had primarily been ironworkers prior to coming to Vermont. This build was designed to facilitate the movement of granite during its transformation from raw material to finished object, typically cemetery markers. Its design took advantage of the development of the overhead traveling bridge crane, which could be used to move heavy granite blocks within a rectangular facility. (The previous horseshoe-shaped facility was serviced by a centrally-placed derrick crane with a boom, which moved the blocks from arriving railroad cars to areas of the building within range of the boom.) The building continued to be used for granite processing (after 1976 by a succession of different owners) until 2009. It now houses ReSOURCE, a local non-profit that repurposes donated building materials and provides job training and other programs.

The trail is a part of the Honolulu Makau Trail System, and leads to a popular 150 foot waterfall called Manoa Falls. Hiking the trail is approximately a one- hour round trip. Many tourists are attracted to the waterfall and scenery throughout the trail. The trails have a history as one of the earlier Hawaiian trails. There are many legends of the Night Marchers, or ancient Hawaiian warriors associated with Manoa Falls. Scenes in movies such as Jurassic Park and Catching Fire were filmed at Manoa Falls. The Manoa Falls trail harbors many plant species and tropical birds as well. The Lyon Arboretum, located in the Manoa Valley at the base of the trail is another popular tourist attraction and aims to preserve endangered Hawaiian plants. Some may say that this trail is \\"Easy\\". However, there is currently no formal way of rating trails. Therefore, since the trail can be very slippery when wet the rating can be subjective. Thus, users should use caution on any trail and turn around if not comfortable. Rain showers are very common in on the trail and the path to the waterfall is often muddy and slippery. Flash floods may also occur at any time. Swimming in the pools of water on the trail is highly discouraged due to the threat of Leptospirosis.  Location  = Manoa Falls Trail = The Manoa Falls Trail is a 1.6 mile trail (round trip) that is a part of the Honolulu Makau Trail System, which consists of 17 other trails in close proximity. The Manoa Falls trail also includes the Manoa Valley, and the Lyon Arboretum. Many people hike the trail to see the Manoa Falls, a 150-foot waterfall that empties into a small pool of water. The location is often referred to as the \\"Rainbow Valley\\", because of the frequent rainbows. The Manoa valley and the surrounding area is considered a tropical rainforest. The Manoa Falls Trail is very humid and frequent rain showers throughout the area are very common. This climate allows for an abundance of plants and wildlife. The trail, specifically near the waterfall is normally damp and muddy. = Manoa, Oahu = The Manoa Falls trail is located in the valley of Manoa in Honolulu, Hawaii. This area receives rain almost every day which leaves the whole valley richly vegetated. Seeing rainbows after a rainfall happens often and is a source of The University of Hawaii at Manoa sport teams names, the Rainbow Warriors (men) and Rainbow Wahines (women). College students visit the Manoa Falls trail often for research and educational purposes. = Nearby Trails = The Manoa Falls trail is part of the Honolulu Mauka Trail System. This system consists of 18 trails surrounding the Honolulu area. # Tantalus Arboretum Trail (0.25 mi / 0.4 km) # Kanealole Trail (0.7 mi / 1.1 km) # Maunalaha Trail (0.7 mi / 1.1 km) # Nahuina Trail (0.75 mi / 1.2 km) # Makiki Valley Trail (1.1 mi / 1.8 km) # Ualaka’a Trail (0.5 mi / 0.85 km) # Moleka Trail (0.75 mi / 1.2 km) # Manoa Cliff Trail (2.3 mi / 3.7 km) # Pu’u Ohia Trail (0.75 mi / 1.2 km) # Pauoa Flats Trail (0.75 mi / 1.2 km) # Nu’uanu Trail (1.5 mi / 2.4 km) # Judd Trail (0.75 mi / 1.2 km) # Aihualama Trail (1.3 mi / 2.1 km) # Manoa Falls Trail (0.8 mi / 1.3 km) # Kolowalu Trail (1.0 mi / 1.6 km) # Wa’ahila Trail (2.4 mi / 0.6 km) # Pu’u Pia Trail (0.75 mi / 1.2 km) # Kalawahine Trail (1.5 mi / 2.4 km)A Shama, a tropical bird commonly found throughout the Manoa Falls Trail. = Ecology = Tropical birds such as the Shama, a chestnut colored bird with a black and white tail inhabit the trails. The trail also contains many ferns, ginger plants, banyan trees, eucalyptus trees, bamboo trees, and hau trees. The hau trees can be distinguished by their flowers which are bright yellow with a dark red center, very similar to those of other hibiscus species.  History and culture  The Manoa Falls Trail was one of the earlier Hawaiian trails and it was most likely used for hunting, bathing, gathering plants, and wood. The wood found on the trails was used by earlier Hawaiians for making canoes, the bark was sometimes used for sandals, and the tree sap was used as a laxative. = Night marchers = Stories and legends have long been linked to Manoa Falls. However, none other than the legend of the Night Marchers evokes shuddering fear from the locals. The Night Marchers-or the Phantom Marchers- are told to be the Spirits of Ancient Hawaiian Warriors. As the legend tells, the direct path of the Night Marchers is the Banyan Tree located in the beginning of the Manoa Falls Trail. It is said the Night Marchers haunt the Manoa Falls Trail and the sounds of banshee screams can be heard as you hike the trail. If one is ever hiking the Manoa Falls Trail it is important to listen for the sound of Conch Shells, the beating of drums, and the light of torches, for these all mark the arrival of the Night Marchers. If one encounters the arrival of the Night Marchers it is crucial to do the following: crouch low to the ground, rest on stomach, and resist the temptation to look the Night Marchers in the Eye. One real life encounter of the Night Marchers happened in the 1970s when two Hawaiian Fishermen claimed they saw the torches of the Night Marchers. The fishermen were baiting their lines when around 10pm they heard the sound of the conch shell followed by the sight of torches in the distance. The fishermen in response laid down on lava rock and avoided eye contact until the Night Marchers left. = Appearance in movies and television series = In the movie Jurassic Park Manoa Falls was used was a filming location. Additionally, Manoa Falls was used as a filming location in the movie Catching Fire, featured as the film's jungle arena. Manoa Falls was also used to film scenes in the television shows Lost and Hawaii Five-0 . = Deaths and injuries = On April 12, 2012, Phillip S. Mann from Scottsmoor, FL fell down the falls during an evening hike alone. Hikers heard cries for help that evening, but search parties did not locate a person. The following day, hikers discovered his body at the bottom of the river bed. The young man likely died on impact. On June 15, 2016 19-year-old Kristi Takanishi, a 2015 valedictorian from Kaiser high school in Honolulu Hawaii, fell from the top of Manoa Falls and died two days later. Sources say she was taking pictures with friends when she slipped and fell off the edge, 200 ft down the waterfall into the small pool of water. Cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma to the head.  Tourism  Manoa Falls Manoa falls is the second most popular trail on the island of Oahu. The Manoa Falls Trail is one of many attraction on the island of Honolulu. Many people who visit this trail also visit the Lyon Arboretum, which preserves many endangered plants and wildlife in the Oahu area. There is less water in the waterfall during the summer months, leaving tourism to fall during the rainy season of November–March. Also, in addition to the Manoa Falls Trail, many tourists visit the other trails in the Honolulu Mauka Trail System. Students at University of Hawaii also visit the trail for research and educational purposes. Both tourists and locals frequently visit the trails. = Risks = The Hawaiian State Department of Health discourages swimming and wading in the small pools surrounding the trail and waterfall. This is because of a bacterial disease called Leptospirosis, which is common in tropical climates such as Hawaii and is found in freshwater. The disease can be passed down from animals to humans, and rats and mice are the most common sources in Hawaii. The disease can cause mild to moderate flu-like symptoms that can last for up to 1 to 2 weeks. There are signs throughout the trail that warn visitors of risk of bacteria in the water, and possible landslides. = Lyon Arboretum = Lyon Arboretum in Oahu, HawaiiLocated in the Manoa Valley section of the Manoa Falls Trail, the Lyon Arboretum contains over 5000 plant species. Some of the plant species include, heliconias, gingers, aroids, bromeliads, and other native Hawaiian plants. The arboretum works to preserve and restore Hawaii's tropical forests, and many endangered plant species. It also functions as both research and academic resources by providing different programs that develop innovations to restore endangered native Hawaiian plants. = Rainbows End Snack Shop = Near entrance to Manoa Falls Trail is a snack shop called Rainbow's End. Here hikers pay for vehicle parking ($5 per vehicle, $3 for Hawaii residents with I.D.), pick up forgotten equipment, or food.

History Notre Dame High School was established on 28 September 1987 by the cooperative efforts of the then Catholic Bishop of Sunyani, Reverend James Kwadwo Owusu and the School Sisters of Notre Dame, Reverend Sister Dorez Mehrtens and Chiefs and people of Fiapre with an initial number of 37 females. The first cramped temporary premises of the school were in a renovated technical school near St. Patrick's Primary and Junior Secondary School behind the Christ the King Cathedral in Sunyani. The school has passed under the leadership of four substantive Headmistresses, the first three of whom were School Sisters of Notre Dame. The pioneer Headmistress was Rev. Sr. Joan Schaeffer, SSND with Rev. Sr. Mary Busson SSND as the Assistant Headmistress. The two were joined by two Rev. Sisters namely Sr. Therese Nowakoski SSND and Sr. Dorothy Ann SSND and three lay personnel as the teaching staff. The first students enrolled generally were those who would have been rejected by the well endowed schools in Ghana. The plan was to locate the school in Fiapre where the Chief and the Fiapre Community had donated the land. Progress on the Fiapre site developed very slowly due to limited funds. Construction commenced in 1992 and only in 1996 did the new Notre Dame Girls Senior High School open for classes at the present site. The foundation stone laying ceremony was performed by the Rev. James Kwadwo Owusu, the then Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sunyani in September 1996. Rev. Sr. Joan Bellew SSND was the Headmistress assisted by Rev. Sr. Mary Leonora Tucker, SSND. The student enrollment stood at 197. The Headmistress who followed Rev. Sr. Joan Schaefer, SSND and pursued the traditions of the founding members were: Rev. Sr. Joan Beltew, SSND, Rev. Sr. Vivian Zolleer, SSND, Miss Margaret Lucy Donkor who handed over to Rev. Sr. Carolyn Boisabi Anyega, SSND. The student population as of the end of 2014/15 academic year was 850 students.

Originally built as a combined Courthouse and jail, it now serves as the seat of Aarhus County Court while the High Court of Western Denmark (Vestre Landsret), based in Viborg, has a courtroom there. Inaugurated in 1906, it was built to the design of L.A. Ludvigsen and Julius Hansen in the Art Nouveau style. History By the turn of the 20th century a new courthouse was badly needed in Aarhus. The population had more than doubled in the preceding 40 years and the existing jailhouse was dilapidated with prisoners regularly finding ways to escape. The Old City Hall functioned as courthouse and police station as well as city hall at the time, and space was short. It was evident to the city council that a new solution was needed with new, large and modern buildings. The decision process was however complicated since the city of Aarhus and the surrounding hundreds and Århus County all jointly managed the court facilities in the city while any changes would have to be approved by the Danish Ministry of Justice. It was decided the new courthouse should be situated on Bispetoften and a committee was established to find a suitable proposal for the structure. In 1901 the committee issued a contest for the courthouse along with a list of specifications for what the house should contain. The winners of the contest was found and construction began shortly after. The project was financed by municipalities around Aarhus and Århus County which also funded operation of it. In 1906 the building was finished. In the 1930s space was running out again; the city continued to grow and more institutions were established in the building. In 1937 a new law made it mandatory for municipalities to make rooms available for the Ministry of Justice free of charge. The change meant it was no longer necessary for the city of Aarhus to fund the courthouse and in 1940 it was sold to the Danish state. Architecture The building was situated some 10 meters away from the street so the facade lined up with a building in Christiansgade. It was the architect Hack Kampmann who selected the placement on the property. The courthouse was constructed in 3 wings with 3 floors of red brick. The base is clad in grey granite and the main staircase is also made of granite. The windows in the two bottom floors have rounded arches while on the 3rd floor they are square. The large hip roof was covered with black, glazed brick. The artist Karl Hansen Reistrup, who also designed the interior of Aarhus Theatre, designed the most important decorative features of the building including two bronze lions placed at the corners of the side-wings and two bronze lanterns which are copies of lamps from Palazzo Strozzi in Firenze from 1500. The Coat of Arms which adorns the front of the building was made by sculptor Elias Ølsgaards. The jailhouse behind the court building was constructed in 4 floors with a large arched window in the north-eastern gable facing Emanuel Sejrs Gade.

He was born in Belfast in 1791, the son of Thomas Mulholland, a cotton manufacturer who founded the company of Messrs. Thomas Mulholland & Co. of Union Street, Belfast. Andrew joined his father's company and took over with his brother when Thomas died, renaming the company Messrs. T. & A. Mulholland. Andrew realised that the supply of flax yarn being made by hand was quite insufficient to meet the demands of the Belfast spinners and that flax was being shipped across to Manchester to be spun and reimported as yarn. He therefore established in 1828 a small mill flax-spinning mill in St. James's Street and subsequently converted their York Street mill (recently rebuilt after a fire) to serve the same purpose. After the death of his brother Andrew carried on the business alone and for some years enjoyed very profitable results from having a near monopoly in the flax-spinning industry. The firm still remains one of the principal businesses in Belfast. When Belfast was incorporated in 1842 Andrew became a member of the council, was elected the third Mayor in 1845, and presented the town with the organ in Ulster Hall at a cost of £3,000. He established a home in Springvale, Ballywalter, co. Down and served as High Sheriff of Down for 1855-56 and as High Sheriff of Antrim for 1858-59. He retired in 1860 and subsequently became a justice of the peace and Deputy Lieutenant. He died at Springvale on 24 August 1866, aged 73.

It has rough, tessellated bark on the trunk and branches, narrow lance-shaped to linear leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and shortened spherical fruit. Description Corymbia lenziana is a straggly, sometimes mallee-like tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, tessellated, brownish bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have narrow lance-shaped to linear leaves that are long, wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are the same shade of dull green on both sides, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded or limpet-shaped operculum. Flowering has been observed in March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, shortened spherical capsule long and wide with the valves deeply enclosed in the fruit. This species is similar to C. eremaea and is distinguished from it mainly on the basis of its habit (a straggly, small tree) and habitat (not in rocky places nor on the crest of sand dunes). Taxonomy and naming Narrow-leaved bloodwood first formally described in 1985 by Denis Carr and Stella Carr and was given the name Eucalyptus lenziana. In 1995 Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia lenziana. The specific epithet (lenziana) honours Janette Rosemary Lenz (born 1948). Distribution and habitat Corymbia lenziana grows in mulga on sandplain and on low rises in desert or semi-desert sand dunes from inland of Shark Bay to east of Wiluna in the Carnarvon, Central Ranges, Gascoyne and Murchison biogeographic regions of Western Australia. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

She dedicated her life to helping others and funding medical research. Her most memorial donation was land, part of Maramec Springs, which is now a park open to the public and maintained by the James Foundation. Early life James was born in St. James, Missouri, to Thomas James and Octavia Bowles James and was a descendant of the family who established the Maramec Iron Works. Maramec Iron Works was developed by her grandfather, William James, and started the beginning of iron production in Missouri, the first successful ironworks west of the Mississippi river. The ironworks went bankrupt before James was born. Due to the bankruptcy, James grew up in South Dakota for her father's new job as a fur trader till the age of three. However, she spent her summers at Maramec Spring with her grandmother, Lucy Ann Dun James. Then, her mother started experiencing horrible health issues and decided to come back to St. James. Personal life James' uncle, Robert G. Dun, paid for her education. James studied in Kansas City, New York, and even studied abroad in Vienna. She was studying to become a concert pianist while in Vienna and studied up Theodor Leschetizky. At the age of 23, she married Huntington Wilson. They spent their time together traveling the world. They divorced 12 years later with no children. She then resided in New York City.http://www.missouritrout.com/mrslwjames.html Dun had died, leaving a large portion of shares for his reporting agency, Dun & Bradstreet to James' father. Due to legal issues, he was unable to receive them. In 1912, she inherited her father’s shares after a drawn out legal process. She spent her time between New York City and St. James. She was a member of the New York Theatre Guild and was accepted in the high society life of New York. She was also equally accepted in St. James, despite the small town’s dislike for \\"big city rich folks.\\" Philanthropy With the money she inherited, she started helping multiple organizations which included the trinity Episcopal Church, the Masonic Cemetery, and the public library of St. James in Missouri. She campaigned for President Taft during his re-election year. She wanted to help those that were less fortunate than her and was involved with helping the elderly, African-Americans, and made charitable contributions for medical research. She gave money to help build the Johns Hopkins Woman's Clinic, where they would focus on gynecology. She also financed the first budget and experimental animal quarters for Memorial Hospital in New York. Illness and death On a tour in Central and South America with her husband, James experienced a severe attack of altitude sickness. Once she was home, she was treated at Johns Hopkins University Hospital. Her health never fully recovered and was failing for multiple years. She suffered from nephritis and had a serious calcium deficiency associated with her tuberculosis. In 1929, she underwent surgery, but never fully recovered. However, she continued to make arrangements with The James Foundation to secure a future for the goals she still wanted to reach while continuing to fight the disease. In 1938, at the age of 58, James died in New York City.  Legacy  Before James’s death, she bought three land sections, over thirteen hundred acres, in Phelps and Crawford counties. This included the Maramec Spring area that was once the site of Maramec Iron Works. She did not allow or accept any proposals from companies that wanted to run a state highway or power transmission line through the land. Her reasoning behind purchasing the land, was that it is \\"a spot of great natural beauty\\". This is when she input the first funds into the Lucy Wortham James Memorial, also known as the James Foundation. Once she had died, she left a portion of her estate to the New York Community Trust to continue her philanthropic interests, which included opening Maramec Spring as a private park that was open to the public. The park was opened in 1965. During the same time as the opening, the foundation built James Memorial Library, gained 56 more acres to the park, and built a swimming pool and fishing lake. There was also small amount of grants given to the Phelps County Memorial Hospital, the Boy Scouts, civic groups, and the Trinity Episcopal Church.

He ruled the Sapadalaksha country, which included parts of present-day Rajasthan in north-western India. He ascended the throne after killing his father Arnoraja, and ruled briefly before being dethroned by his brother Vigraharaja IV.  Reign  Jagaddeva was one of the three sons born to the Chahamana king Arnoraja and his queen Sudhava, who was a princess of Marwar. His two brothers were Vigraharaja IV and Devadatta. The Prithviraja Vijaya states that the eldest son of Sudhava meted out the same treatment to Arnoraja that Parashurama had meted out to his mother (that is, killed the parent). The text does not name this son, but names Arnoraja's successor as Vigraharaja IV, who had good qualities (sattva guṇa). Other texts, such as Hammira Mahakavya, Prabandha Kosha and Surjana Charita name Arnoraja's successor as Jagaddeva. This indicates that Jagaddeva ascended the Chahamana throne after killing his father. Before Jagaddeva could consolidate his position, his younger brother Vigraharaja dethroned him and became the new Chahamana king.

Life and career  After studying at the École d'art dramatique Jean-Périmony (drama school) and a very brief career as an actor, Cyril Dion coordinated projects for the 'Fondation Hommes de Parole'. He organized an Israeli-Palestinian congress at Caux in 2003, 2005 and 2006, and the first and second world Congress of Imams and Rabbis for peace in Brussels and Sevilla. In 2007, he founded with a few friends, the ecological movement Colibris (hummingbird in French). He was director until July 2013. In 2010, he was advisor and co-producer with Colibris of the movie Think global act Local by Coline Serreau. In 2012, he co-founded Kaizen magazine, and was editor in chief from March 2012 to April 2014. He is also Editor in Chief of the Domaine du Possible (The field of possibilities) collection of the French publisher Actes Sud with Jean-Paul Capitani. = Artistic activity and public recognition = He has written poetry since he was 17 and published in 2014 a collection of poems (Sitting on the edge) Assis sur le fil, Table Ronde Editions. He wrote and co-produced with Mélanie Laurent the documentary film Tomorrow, released in movie theaters in France on December 2, 2015; as well as two books published by Actes Sud in France and translated into English, German, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Korean. Tomorrow won the Cesar award for Best Documentary (Oscar equivalent in France) in 2016 and over one million people went to see it in movie theatres in France. It is now released in over 30 countries. It is cited by many French people as the trigger for a new kind of engagement in the course of the following years. For the French newspaper Libération \\"Cyril Dion succeeds in one hour and fifty-eight minutes, what decades of environmental struggle failed to do: lay the foundations for a\\" new collective fiction\\". In the US, the movie was critick's pick of the New York Times and obtained 93% on Rotten Tomatoes. In September 2016, he was President of the jury of the documentary movie in Festival Biarritz Amérique latine. In October he was the Godfather of festival Atmosphère with the French singer Camille and the FIFF Campus in Namur, Belgium. Between March and June 2017, he is the key proponent of the tour: \\"the song of Hummingbirds, the call of the world of tomorrow\\". Seven concerts throughout France brought artists together to perform, he performed with about forty artists including Alain Souchon, Matthieu Chedid, Izia, Dominique A, Albin de la Simone, Arthur H, Zaz, Tryo , Emily Loizeau, Jeanne Cherhal, Bastien Lallemant, Piers Faccini, Gael Faure, Xavier Polycarpe, Sebastien Hoog. Cyril Dion punctuated the performance with poetry readings of his book “Assis sur le fil” and texts from the book “Tomorrow”. In August 2017, he published his first novel published by Actes Sud: Imago (not translated in English). The book is well received by critics and booksellers. For Libération, \\"the co-director of the film Tomorrow, delivers a first novel that a fast pitch can serve. However, if he gave himself up to the perilous exercise of the subject three times in a row, he took the side of his four characters, with an uncompromising empathy and a haunting writing. In May 2018, he publishes “Petit manuel de resistance contemporaine” (A small manual of contemporary resistance) at Actes Sud. As soon as it was published, the book ranked in the best-selling essays. For Charlotte Bloch in the French weekly magazine L'Express: > \\"Far from being moralistic or utopian, this incisive little book full of > ideas is a real breath of fresh air because of its particular approach to > modern ecology. Here, we do not beat around the bush, but we ask questions > while trying to find practical and constructive answers. \\" The book is translated in German, Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean but not yet in English. On December 11, 2018 his second film After Tomorrow (Après-Demain) was broadcast on France 2 in France and then on RTBF in Belgium and RTS in Switzerland. Commissioned by French Public Service Television (France 2), it was meant to accompany the first TV broadcast of Tomorrow. The intention of this 71-minute documentary was to meet people who implemented projects after seeing the documentary Tomorrow. As in his book “Petit Manuel de Résistance Contemporaine”, he develops the thesis that stories play a preponderant role in the evolution of society. \\"This is the conclusion of After Tomorrow: things change when there are enough people who tell a new story and engage in a non-violent street fight, such as civil rights or women's rights\\". On May 21, 2019 he created with the guitarist and composer Sébastien Hoog, the show Résistances Poétiques at the Maison de la Poésie in Paris, which mixes poetry and music. The show was reprised . A tour organised by Décibels Productions is planned for 2021. For Cyril Dion : > \\"Faced with the prospect of an ecological collapse, immersed in the digital > age, caught up in the whirlwind of information, confronted with violence and > inequality, we need poetry, beauty and music. Reading and writing poetry is > already resistance to a world obsessed with financial return, performance > and consumerism. It means taking the time to listen to the din inside us and > to tap into our creative, spiritual resources to cope. And trying to build > another future.\\" In September 2019 he begins shooting his third film Animal which is due to be released in October 2020. = Climate activism = He is one of the leading figures in the French climate movement that is organising the Climate Marches starting in September 2018. In particular, he spoke at the March on 13 October calling for the movement to be amplified and given a strategy. On 4 December, he called on the yellow jacket movement to join the climate marches, considering that : > \\"If we lose this battle, there will be no more purchasing power to defend or > democracy to protect. There will only be wars, shortages and an unliveable > planet. The good news is that the reason the planet is devastated is the > same reason that causes relocations, modern slavery in factories, which > leads the rich to become richer and the rest of the population to become > poorer: an economic system whose obsession is profit, in the short term, at > any price, and which concentrates wealth in a few hands. » On December 18, 2018, he took part in the action L'Affaire du Siècle, launched by four NGOs (Greenpeace, Oxfam France, la Fondation Nicolas Hulot and Notre affaire à tous). Their common goal: take the French State to court for not acting on climate change. In a few days online mobilization beats all the petition records in France and gather 2,17 million signatories. In January 2019, he is part of the Citizens' Vests collective which calls for the creation of a \\"citizens' assembly\\" drawn by lot and operating according to the principles of deliberative democracy to get out \\"from above\\" of the Yellow Vests crisis. On February 13, he met with Emmanuel Macron and actress Marion Cotillard and proposed to the president to set up such an assembly to seek solutions on the citizens' initiative referendum, ecological transition and fiscal justice. On April 13, 2019, he explains in an interview with Le Monde why he believes that only collective intelligence can provide solutions to a problem as complex as the climate crisis. In it, he is critical of the great national debate organized by the government and believes that : > \\"If we want to achieve results that are shared by all, we need to > redistribute power, and to build this complementarity between representative > democracy and direct democracy. With this Citizens' Assembly, it is not a > question of making a move, as was the case with the great debate, but of > demonstrating that we can integrate these mechanisms into our democracies on > a permanent basis.\\" The Convention gives rise to 149 measures. Emmanuel Macron announces 146 on 29 June, announces a referundum on Article 1 of the Constitution and the examination of a major law taking up these proposals in fall.

The glacier on Mount Ararat will soon be gone and anchovies may no longer swim to Turkish waters. Zonguldak: Turkey's first coal mining region would need help to give up. reforestation. Turkey is one of the countries which is being most affected by global warming. Annual temperatures are rising as are maximum temperatures. Greenhouse gas emissions by Turkey are 1% of the global total and are forecast to rise substantially because the energy policy of Turkey is to heavily subsidize coal in Turkey.\\"Fossil Fuel Support - TUR\\", OECD, accessed September 2018. Greenhouse gas emissions by Turkey Turkey emits about 500 Mt CO2eq each year, about 6 tons per person. Almost three quarters is from the energy sector, the largest source being Turkey's coal- fired power stations.  Effects  Turkey is forecast to be more severely effected than many other countries, but effects will vary considerably across the regions of the country. = Weather = The weather is becoming more extreme. During the 21st century temperatures are forecast to rise by 2-3 °C on average and precipitation to significantly reduce.Ministry of Environment and Urbanization (2016), p. 22 However, as well as more droughts more floods are predicted, due to rain falling instead of snow. The worst case is a 7 degree rise by 2100. = Wildfires = Wildfires have increased due to climate change. = Cities = Urban heatwaves, droughts, storms, and flooding, may increase. Sea level rise is forecast to affect city infrastructure, for example Istanbul Kadıkoy metro station is threatened with flooding. Xeriscaping of green spaces has been suggested, and Istanbul has a climate change action plan. However, according to a 2018 study by Trakya University more local climate change action plans need to be prepared urgently. = Water = Glaciers in Turkey including the glaciers on Mount Ararat are retreating. According to Professor Barış Karapınar, water is lost through evaporation due to old-fashioned irrigation techniques used by the Southeastern Anatolia Project, increasing the risk of severe water shortage. Reduced hydroelectricity in Turkey is forecast. Floods in 2020 caused billions of lira in damages. = Agriculture = Unless global emissions are greatly reduced agriculture in Turkey, such as wheat, is expected to be severely affected after the late 2030s especially in areas with rain fed agriculture. Arid and semi-arid areas are at risk of desertification. Irrigated agriculture will decline as water stress increases and increasing food imports will hit Turkey's trade balance. Damage to agriculture is predicted to greatly increase. Pine nut production has been severely reduced. = Fishing = The warming of Lake Van is reducing oxygen for pearl mullet.  Politics  According to the Eleventh Development Plan (2019-2023): \\"It is seen that climate change accelerating due to high greenhouse gas emissions causes natural disasters and poses a serious threat to humanity.\\" and \\"International climate change negotiations will be conducted within the framework of the Intended National Contribution with the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and within the scope of national conditions, climate change will be tackled in sectors causing greenhouse gas emissions and the resilience of the economy and society to climate risks will be increased by capacity building for adaptation to climate change.\\" Turkey, like neighbouring Iran, is one of the few countries that has signed but not ratified the Paris Agreement, in other words it is a signatory but not one of the parties to the agreement. The main opposition Republican People's Party has called for the agreement to be ratified. Similarly Turkey has signed but not ratified the Kigali Amendment. It has no carbon tax or emissions trading scheme, therefore carbon capture and storage is not used as it is not economically viable. Also \\"given the fact that a new coal-fired power plant has a minimum of 40 years of economic life, Turkey's coal rush could create an inextricable carbon lock-in.\\" =Protests= In 2019 some Turkish schoolchildren joined the School strike for climate and Turkey's branch of Extinction Rebellion demonstrated for Turkey to ratify the Paris Agreement. Economics Loss in Gross Domestic Product per capita by 2100 is forecast to be less than 1% for slight global warming (RCP 2.6 Scenario) but almost 8% for severe global warming (RCP 8.5 Scenario). Religion Muslim environmentalists and academics quote the Quran in support of their environmentalism, and in Istanbul in 2015 Islamic leaders urged the world's 1.6 billion Muslims to help defeat climate change.\\"Islamic Declaration on Climate Change\\" UNFCCC, 18 August 2015 Education The arts are raising awareness of climate change and education is supported by the EU. =Misunderstandings about climate change= Individual action on climate change is not properly understood (in a survey of primary school teachers many erroneously prioritised using less cosmetics) and neither are government choices on climate change mitigation (in the same survey only a minority correctly prioritised curbing fossil fuel use). Future warming of seawater by Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant is wrongly thought by some to be relevant to climate change, and few know that geothermal power in Turkey might emit considerable (research on this due 2019 is being funded by the EBRD).  Adaptation  In 2019 the OECD recommended that adaptation efforts be increased,OECD (2019), page 38 an international conference on local actions was held, and work on 12 regional adaptation plans continued. Protection of water resources and soil quality have been considered, however Turkey has yet to submit a National Adaptation Plan to the UNFCCC.  Media coverage  In the 1990s independent media outlet Açık Radyo (Open Radio) was one of the first to cover climate change, and its founder Ömer Madra emphasises \\"The three Y’s in the fight on climate change: Yerel (local) Yatay (horizontal, not vertical) and Yavaş (slow, no resort to violence).\\" See also *Energy policy of Turkey Sources    * References  External resources  * Istanbul International Centre for Energy and Climate  External links  * Turkey-EU project * European Climate Adaptation Platform (CLIMATE-ADAPT) * NDC Registry * CLIMATE CHANGE IN TURKEY:Istanbul Policy Center: Sabanci University * CDP Turkey 2017 Climate Change Report * Turkey and climate change on Global Energy Monitor * Climate Action Network Europe * Climate Change Post * EDAM Category:Climate of Turkey ","title":"Climate change in Turkey"},{"id":"51862005","text":"The 1891 United States Senate election in Kansas was held on January 28, 1891, to elect Kansas' Class III senator in its delegation.

Benkunsky was born in 1913 in Kasimov in what was then the Russian Empire. His father, Stanislav Gilyarievich Benkunsky (1880-1920), was from the nobility of Vilna Province and fought in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, where he won the Order of St. George. His mother, Varvara Semyonovna Yukawa (1884-1952), was graduated from the Medical Institute in Kharkov and worked as a pharmacist in Yegoryevsk. She was a recipient of the Order of Lenin. Benkunsky was graduated from the Balashov Higher Military Aviation School in 1933, after which he was posted to Irkutsk with the Ninth Air Group; one of the unit's itineraries was Irkutsk-Yakutsk-Bodaibo which at this time was nicknamed \\"Route Courage\\". From the beginning of the German-Soviet Campaign of World War II (called, in the Soviet Union, the Great Patriotic War), Benkunsky was part of the Special Purpose Transport Air Fleet of the Moscow Air Group, equipped with Lisunov Li-2s (license built Douglas DC-3s). In his aircraft the \\"Sky Snail\\" Benkunsky flew missions in defiance of German fighters in the skies over Moscow, then Leningrad, then Stalingrad, Sevastopol and the Caucasus – wherever the need and danger was greatest. During the war, Li-2s were used for transport, partisan supply, as ambulance aircraft, and even for bombing. Benkunsky was the only Aeroflot pilot to be awarded four Orders of Lenin. He also received other awards and medals including the Order of the Red Banner of Labour and the Order of the Red Star. On August 12, 1944, Benkunsky and his crew flew the Soviet diplomatic delegation for the development of the United Nations Charter, headed by Ambassador Andrei Gromyko, from Moscow to Washington, D. C. After the war, Benkunsky flew a total of nearly thirty thousand hours. He flew to the United States over the North Pole, and to Africa, Western Europe, and Asia. He mastered several kinds of piston engine and turboprop civil aviation aircraft.

INAPAM offers programs to improve the well-being of the elderly. Services include providing education regarding physical and mental health, hosting different cultural activities, and holding job expositions. Also, INAPAM offers training for people 65 years-of-age and older to become authorized caretakers for the elderly.  Background  In 1975, INAPAM was implemented as part of the Secretariat of Health, however, the institute did not start its work until 2000. INAPAM organizes Mexico's aging policy. INAPAM is supported by the Pension Program for the Elderly. Pension Program for the Elderly is a program administered by the Secretariat of Social Development. The goal of the program is to provide financial support and services to the elderly in Mexico. During a session established on July 2, 2013, the positions and functions of the members of the citizen council of the INAPAM were established. C. María Eugenia Moreno Gómez is the president of the committee. Dr. Ignacio Javier Orozco García and Guillermo Andrés Espinosa Velasco are in charge of setting up meetings and making decisions. The citizen committee gets together four times a year to present, promote and propose ideas that will improve the programs available in the INAPAM. The main topics discussed are advice on how to spread information socially so individuals of all ages are aware of what it means to become an elder and what rights each elder possesses. With this, the INAPAM hopes that the rights for the elderly will not be taken for granted and will be valued. = Demography = The Demographics of Mexico are important to understanding why the country created this program for the elderly. Since 1975, the median age of the Mexican population has risen significantly. In 2015, the median age of the population was 27.4 years. Also, from 2004 to 2015, the portion of the population aged 65 years and over increased gradually. = Goals = INAPAM provides programs for individuals over the age of 60 who wish to stay active. The main goal of INAPAM is to make sure that the elderly can enjoy their lives by taking advantage of the opportunities and rights that they provide to them.  Eligibility  The INAPAM discount card is available to all Mexican citizens and foreign residents who are 60 years of age and above. To apply for an INAPAM card, citizens must have four requirements covered. The first necessary step is to provide verification for the people's identity. The program requires people to send in at least 8 pieces of identification. A few of these forms of identification include the person's IMSS credentials (Mexican Social Security Institute), ISSSTE credentials (Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers), and a valid passport. The second step that the program requires is a verification that the individual is over 60 years of age, which includes similar identification documents.  Benefits  The INAPAM discount card provides benefits for its citizens in all different types of categories. Benefits that come with this card include discounts with: *Medications in Pharmacies *Dentists and doctors *Buses, airlines, some taxi firms *Convenience stores, local food stores *Hotels and travel agencies *Festivity halls *Museums, archeology parks, art galleries, and bookstores *Some legal firms, art and craft stores, car services, repair centers, plumbers, electricians, dry cleaners, etc. *Property taxes and water bills varying by municipality INAPAM not only provides discounts of goods and services but also searches to provide certain kinds of jobs for elderly people. Mexico has a number of laws surrounding the care of elderly citizens and INAPAM is an organization that makes sure these laws are kept in place. The Federal Elder Rights Law contains all the laws concerning the treatment and rights of older people in Mexico. Under these laws INAPAM has the need to protect its members, to ensure that they are being included in activities depending on their capacities, to promote the research related to the elderly and to provide a community for these individuals to associate with.

The window can be vertically or horizontally oriented, openable or fixed. It can also be regular or elongately-shaped and can have a separator (mullion). Typically, the cellular window is used for an attic or as a decorative feature, but it can also be a major architectural element to provide the natural lighting inside buildings. The hexagonal window is relatively rare and associated with such architectural styles as constructivism, functionalism and, occasionally, cubism. History Attic hexagonal windows were occasionally used in the Northern European manor architecture of the 19th century. The concept became popular thanks to the Russian constructivist architect Konstantin Melnikov, whose own famous house had 124 hexagonal windows, which were the main source of light as ceiling lights were not provided in many rooms. Cellular windows are also a feature of the Scandinavian functionalism architecture of the 1940s–1960s and are a kind of synthesis of tradition and modernism in the architecture. Today, hexagonal windows may be associated with honeycomb houses, a concept proposed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright and explore an idea of organic architecture, which considers the nature as a main source of architectural imagination.

It is oriented north-south, and crosses the river just east of the Huntington Falls dam. It is a single-span metal truss, in a style sometimes called a double-intersection Warren truss, but in a style more similar to that of a Whipple truss. It is long and has a roadway width of (one lane). Its end portals are at the center, and have rounded corners. The structural elements of the trusses are joined by rivets. The bridge derives its name from loosely laid deck boards, which rattled when they were driven on. with The bridge was built in 1908 by the American Bridge Company, as part of a program begun in 1892 by the state to improve its transport infrastructure. The road which it carries was originally the Waltham Pike, opened in 1808, which was the first road to traverse the town of Weybridge.

It is endemic to South Africa and only known from the Klein Swartberg Mountain, an inselberg near Caledon, Western Cape. The specific name rugosa is Latin for wrinkled or rough and refers to the rough appearance of this species (caused by distinct glandular tubercles ) as well as its rough sounding advertisement call. Accordingly, common name rough moss frog has been suggested for it. Description Arthroleptella rugosa are small frogs. Males in the type series measured and the single female in snout–vent length. There are a large number of very distinct glandular protuberances on the dorsal surfaces, distinct from all other Arthroleptella species. The limbs are relatively short. Adults are uniform dark chocolate brown in colour, with slightly paler, irregular dorsolateral bands that may become visible under bright lighting conditions. The sole female was densely speckled dark and light grey. The typical male advertisement call is a \\"chirp\\", a short pulsed call of two to four pulses. The second type is a \\"chuckle\\" composed of 6–10 pulsed notes, making rough, squeaky sounding chirp that is quite different from the calls in other Arthroleptella species. The chuckle may precede the typical chirp call or an aggression call. A single clutch of seven eggs has been observed. The tadpoles do not swim; instead they remain almost sedentary on a moist substrate until metamorphosing approximately 3 weeks after hatching. The tadpoles do not have a functional mouth. Habitat and conservation Arthroleptella rugosa inhabit fynbos heathland vegetation and can be found in dense Restionaceae stands very near seepages at elevations of above sea level. The habitat is under severe threat from fire and invasive plant species. In addition, the species has very small extent of occurrence (searches on neighbouring mountains have not revealed any specimens), and has therefore been assessed as \\"Critically Endangered\\".

It is remarkable for the extreme placement of its pineal foramen, which bulges out of the posterior margin of its skull. Etymology Sauroscaptor means \\"lizard mole\\" or \\"lizard digger\\", and is derived from the Greek word σαῦρος, meaning \\"lizard\\", and the Greek word σκάπτω, meaning \\"digger\\", which is used as a suffix in the Indian mole genera Euroscaptor and Parascaptor. The type species, S. tharavati, honors Tharavat S. Kutty, discoverer of the Kundaram Formation fauna that includes Sauroscaptor. History The fossils of Sauroscaptor show various forms of compression, and were originally interpreted as pertaining to several different genera of dicynodont. However, the shared presence of several unique traits not affected by compression proved that the fossils all belonged to a single endemic species. Description Sauroscaptor, like most cistecephalids, was a tuskless, small-bodied, fossorial dicyonodont. The posterior margin of its pineal foramen bulges out from the back of the skull, resulting in a chimney-like nuchal crest continuous with the foramen. It has a significantly narrower skull table than is typical for cistecephalids. It is closely similar to an unnamed genus from Zambia, which shares the unusual pineal foramen position, but differ in the breadth of the skull table and morphology of the nuchal crest, as well as in the Zambian taxon being the only known tusked cisticephalid. Classification Sauroscaptor is the basalmost known cistecephalid dicynodont.

Early life and education Towle was born and raised in Butte, Montana. In 1919, she received a BA in Education from Goucher College. After graduation, she worked at the American Red Cross and became increasingly interested in social work. With financial support from a Commonwealth Fund fellowship, she attended New York School of Social Work (now the Columbia University School of Social Work). She earned a degree in Psychiatric Social Work in 1926. Career Towle worked for two years (1926-1928) as the director of the Home Finding Department of The Children's Aid Society of Philadelphia. From 1928 to 1932, she did casework supervision and further trained in psychiatric social work at the Institute for Child Guidance in New York. \\"Established by the Commonwealth Fund as a model clinic, the Institute was in the forefront of psychiatric social work theory and practice. Towle served as the Institute's fieldwork supervisor for students from the New York and Smith College schools of social work.\\" In 1932, Towle was appointed to a full-time faculty position at the School of Social Service Administration at University of Chicago. In 1945, her most famous work, Common Human Needs, was published by the Federal Security Agency. A few years after the book came out, it became embroiled in the “Common Human Needs Affair.” The main problem was one use of the word “socialized,” where she meant socialization and not socialism. But in the context of the “red scare” of the 1950s, this gained traction. The head of the American Medical Association (AMA) called the book “viciously and malevolently un-American.” The book had been published by what is now the Department of Health and Human Services. The AMA was worried they were on the path toward universal health care, which they strongly opposed. Pitching this book as “socialist propaganda” was part of a larger crusade by them to paint all public assistance as “socialism” in order to prevent universal health care. The book and its plates were destroyed. But social workers saw great value and guidance in the book, so the biggest professional organization began printing and has been its publisher since. 1953-54 she taught the Dutch exchange student Cora Baltussen (1912-2005),Baltussen, Cora: Eindrapport.

The square is named after St. Peter's Abbey, which is located along its east side. It is Ghent's largest public square and a regular venue for cultural and sporting events, such as the annual Mid-Lent Fair in March. The square and its surrounding buildings are a protected cityscape. Locale Blandijn faculty. Located on the south side of the Blandijnberg, Ghent's highest point, Sint-Pietersplein is at the heart of Ghent's student neighbourhood. It is directly adjacent to the Arts & Philosophy Faculty of Ghent University in the north; and leads to the Overpoort, known for its concentration of student bars, in the south. The long east side harbours the baroque Our Lady of St. Peter's Church and St. Peter's Abbey, as well as several neoclassical 19th-century houses and the side-entrance to the university's Faculty of Economics and Business. Opposite of the church and abbey is a monumental staircase leading to the adjacent St. Amand's Square, sided by bistros and restaurants. History The current outlay of Sint- Pietersplein was designed by urban architect Leclerc-Restiaux and laid out in 1848-1851. With its rectangular dimensions of 80 by 200 m, it is Ghent's largest open public square. Underneath Sint-Pietersplein, an underground three-level car park was constructed in the early 21st century. Upon completion of the car park in 2006, the previous asphalt surface was replaced with a brown-and-grey dimension stone pavement and 18 oak trees were planted on the north side. Events The square stages several cultural and sporting events, such as the annual three-week-long Mid-Lent Fair, the academy year Student Kick-Off, the start and finish of the cycling classic Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, a beach volleyball tournament and open-air music concerts. Because of its location outside of the original ramparts of Ghent, the square is not used for the famed Gentse Feesten music and theatre festival.

Charles Chiniquy and Bishop Joseph Rene Vilatte of the American Catholic Church (No longer in existence). This community is not in union with the Episcopal Church, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence, or the Union of Utrecht. The community strives after union with the Union of Utrecht, through the help of the Episcopal Church.  Old Catholicism in the United States  Fr. Charles Chiniquy who inspired Joseph René Vilatte to minister to the community in Wisconsin In the area of Green Bay, Wisconsin, Joseph René Vilatte began working with Catholics of Belgian ancestry and with the knowledge and blessing of the Union of Utrecht and under the full jurisdiction of the local Episcopal Bishop of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, Bishop John Henry Hobart Brown. Vilatte was ordained a deacon on 6 June 1885 and priest on 7 June 1885 by the Most Rev. Eduard Herzog, bishop of the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland. Vilatte's work provided the only sacramental presence in that particular part of rural Wisconsin (under the jurisdiction of the Episcopal Bishop of Fond du Lac). Vilatte received a stipend from the Episcopal Church aas well as aid to help build the Old Catholic Church in America under Bishop Brown. In time, Vilatte asked the Old Catholic Archbishop of Utrecht to be ordained a bishop so that he might confirm, but his petition was not granted because of Utrecht's desire for unity with the Episcopal Church and the political turmoil with the new bishop, Charles Chapman Grafton. Vilatte sought opportunities for consecration in the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches. He was made a bishop in Ceylon, India on 28 May 1892 under the jurisdiction of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch. Vilatte's consecration was in the line of St. Peter, the founder of the Church of Antioch. In 1908 the Archbishop of Utrecht, Gerardus Gul, consecrated Father Arnold Harris Mathew, a former Roman Catholic priest, as Regionary Bishop for England. His mission was to establish a community for Anglicans and Roman Catholics. In 1913, Bishop Mathew claimed to have secured permission from the continental Old Catholic bishops for his consecration of Rudolph Edward de Landen Berghes as a bishop to work among the Scots. St. Louis de France Cathedral of Green Bay, Wisconsin, 1895 Bishop de Berghes was frequently called \\"the Prince\\". He was of noble birth but had never claimed the title for himself. The title of \\"Prince\\" was rightfully that of his older brother who had died. When Bishop de Berghes became eligible to inherit he was in a religious community and could not accept the title. At the beginning of World War I, Bishop de Berghes went to the United States at the suggestion of the Anglican Primate, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Bishop Mathew later declared his autonomy from the Union of Utrecht, finding it too \\"protestant oriented\\". Mathew sent missionaries to the United States, including the theosophist Bishop J. I. Wedgwood (1892–1950) and Bishop Rudolph de Landas Berghes et de Rache (1873–1920). De Berghes arrived in the United States on 7 November 1914, hoping to unite the various independent Old Catholic jurisdictions under Archbishop Mathew. Bishop de Berghes, in spite of his isolation, was able to plant the seed of Old Catholicism in the Americas. He consecrated a former Capuchin Franciscan priest as bishop: Carmel Henry Carfora. From this the Old Catholic Church in the United States evolved into local and regional self-governing dioceses and provinces along the design of St. Ignatius of Antioch - a network of communities.  Old Catholicism in the Rhode Island area  In 1917, the first Old Catholic parish was built by Bishop Franciszek Hodur of the Polish National Catholic Church which was a member of the Union of Utrecht until 2003. Parishes were also constructed in Woonsocket and in the neighboring, Fall River, Massachusetts. Bishop Vilatte of the American Catholic Church was a colleague of his Polish counterparts and visited the communities in Rhode Island and Fall River. Many of these churches are still active today. Blessed Virgin Polish National Catholic Church, first Polish church in Fall River, Mass., 1898 In the April 1928 issue of the American Catholic Church newsletter, The Antiochean, Dr. Casmir Durand, is consecrated Bishop of the French-speaking churches and successor of Joseph Rene Vilatte. In May, Henri Perdriau of Rhode Island gave him his support and invited the Franco-Americans to join the church. He published under Bishop Durand's Imprimatur, and with his collaboration, the brochure called Fiat Lux- Le bon sens et la logique (common sense and logic). It was written after Rome had excommunicated the 56 leaders of a movement that was opposing the Roman Catholic Bishop W. Hickey of Providence, under the auspices of the newspaper La Sentinelle of Woonsocket, where Perdriau was a journalist. Bishop Hickey was forcing the French-speaking parishes of his diocese to fund English schools only, through compulsory taxes. Perdriau was also the master of Guido Nincheri who produced the famous stained glass and frescos found in St. Ann's Church in Woonsocket. Members of this new parish came from St. Ann's Church and Precious Blood Church. Bishop Durand wrote his essay, The Old Catholic Church while he was in Woonsocket, to establish a Franco-American parish. He celebrated the inaugural Mass in the Polish National Catholic Churchon Sunday, August 26, 1928 with 65 people in attendance. The Woonsocket parish was short lived. Eventually in 1929, the excommunicated protesters were readmitted to communion to the Roman Catholic Church and the Franco- American parish faded away. * First Polish Church of the Blessed Virgin Founded in 1898 in Fall River, Massachusetts.

Beliefs  \\"By maintaining and professing faithfully the doctrine of Jesus Christ, by refusing to admit those errors which by the fault of men have crept into the Catholic Church, by laying aside the abuses in ecclesiastical matters, together with the worldly tendencies of the hierarchy, we believe that we shall be able to combat efficaciously the great evils of our day, which are unbelief and indifference in matters of religion.\\" Declaration of Utrecht, 1889 Article 8 = Vilatte's community church model = \\"I visited the various families and urged them to ignore their doctrinal differences for the present and unite in one Community Church. I felt I could preach nothing but the Gospel of Grace; that neither Roman Catholicism nor Protestantism could satisfy the needs of these people but a Christian Catholic Church without any other qualification. A purified Church which would present the Gospel to them as did the Primitive Church, and exercise authority according to the spirit of free America.\\" (Bishop Joseph Rene Vilatte, Autobiography, 1910) = Worship = The Mass of the parish church uses patristic, Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands, and Vatican II liturgies. The John Paul II Mass is the most commonly used liturgy in the parish. It is similar to the current Roman Rite Mass except some parts are from the other two Masses. Eucharistic Prayer I combines the Roman Rite of 1985 with the Dutch Rite. The parish did not adapt to the 2011 changes within the Roman Catholic Church. = Sacraments = The Old Catholic Church holds that there are Seven Sacraments of the Church, at least two of which were commissioned by Christ in the Gospels. The Sacraments were instituted as a means of healing and uniting humanity once again to one another and to God. The scourge of humanity is sin, isolation, and despair, the answer is God's healing through grace. In that spirit we encourage all to receive the grace of healing and to be made whole again. = Eucharist = Following the Old Catholic and later Roman Catholic traditions, the vernacular is used during the liturgy with the exception of some Greek, Latin, and Spanish. Old Catholics believe in the doctrine of the Real Presence, that the bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ at the consecration. Communion is distributed under both species. Frequently, the community leaves the pews to gather around the altar for the celebration of the Eucharist. Only an ordained priest with apostolic succession is allowed to consecrate the Eucharist. All baptized Christians are invited to receive the Eucharist regardless of their current state of grace. = Confession = The parish regards a confession of sins to God, followed by the assignment of penance and absolution given by the priest, to be the way the congregation normally obtains forgiveness of sins. The sacrament may be administered in one of two ways: public or private. Adults may avail themselves of private confession if they so wish. The sacrament is always available but not required for the reception of Eucharist. = Birth control = The parish teaches that the use of birth control is a matter of personal judgment for husband and wife, rather than the responsibility of church authorities to instruct its members regarding specific times of procreation. = Pro-Life = The Old Catholic Church holds that human life should be protected from the moment of conception. However, the question of politically how this goal is to be achieved is not determined by church law but by best practices. In the spirit of Catholicism, we hold a seamless garment on life issues from conception to natural death which includes issues of poverty and human dignity. The pro-life stance of the community is not a political stance, but a stance based on the belief of the intrinsic value which all people possess. = Marriage and divorce = The church believes that marriage is the sacrament which unites the married couple and gives them grace to be faithful to each other and to bring up their children in love and devotion to God. The Old Catholic Church permits divorced people to participate fully in the Mass and to receive the Eucharist. The parish follows the Eastern tradition in allowing for a remarriage after a first divorce without an annulment. A third marriage faces a great deal of scrutiny and a fourth is not permissible. = Priesthood and marriage = Since the early 1900s the Old Catholic Church has permitted its clergy to be married, and in practice encourages them to be so. They believe that a married priest will have a better understanding of the marital issues facing his parishioners. The Church also allows women to be ordained, following the tradition of the early church. = Sexuality = The parish largely agrees with the Roman Catholic Catechism on issues of sexuality but disagrees about the claims that the Church has consistently rejected homosexuality in all forms and that Scripture finds the sexual acts \\"gravely depraved.\\" However, the parish affirms that morality and sexuality are deep- seated elements of Christianity and that relativism and subjective morality are rejected. The Old Catholic Church does not make an issue about sexuality, claiming that there are larger social issues on which Christians should be focusing. = Documents = As a primary document, the parish accepts fully the eight articles of the Declaration of Utrecht as well as the 1931 Bonn Agreement. The parish also embraces the authentic truths found within the Vatican II documents, with exception to the statements concerning the infallibility of the Pope and the temporal centrality of the diocese of Rome. = Infallibility = The Old Catholic Church does not accept the infallibility of Rome on matters of faith and morals. The church also rejects the principle of universal jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome. However, the Old Catholic Church recognizes the primacy of the Pope as first among equals, Bishop of Rome, Vicar of St. Peter, and Patriarch of the West. The Papacy is intended to be a unifying force which unites Christians around the table of the . The Old Catholic Church does not reject the as does, yet they do not pay total obedience as is expected by practicing Roman Catholics. = Governance = The parish is governed in accordance with its bylaws and parish council documents. Bishops and priests possess the authority to explain and teach the doctrinal position of the Church in matters of faith, morals and discipline. The legislative authority of the Church is vested in the parish council and the Parish Meeting. In financial and administrative matters, the parishioners possess administrative authority. The council members work in cooperation with the pastor. Some of the parishes are members of the Rhode Island State Council of Churches.  Overseers  \\"We want to guard against Carforism. Our Church is clean and pure. Every man is a gentleman. [Every woman is a lady.] Every priest, a shepherd of souls. The Church is young and small but it is holy and without spot. The size of the church is less important than the nature and kind of clergy it possesses. We teach and believe all that ancient and historic Catholic Christendom teaches.\\" Bishop Paul Francis Cope 1941  See also  * Old Catholic Church * Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands * Joseph René Vilatte * Mariavite Church * Czechoslovak Hussite Church * Arnold Mathew  References   Bibliography  * Mathew, Arnold Harris An Episcopal Odyssey.

E. van Vogt, originally published in Astounding in February 1950. In contrast to his earlier short stories, \\"The Sound\\" has a distinctly Red Scare feel to it. It involves the alien Yevd who can take on any form, and a young boy that thwarts their effort to infiltrate a naval spaceship yard. Plot summary After many years of warfare with the alien Yevd, mankind is on the verge of completing The Ship. The Yevd are aware of this, and have tried to infiltrate the shipyard in Solar City where it is being built. Humans have kept the Yved out by spraying tailored microbes into the air around the yard. The Yved use light to communicate, and these organs can also be used to cloak their bodies in a shapeshifting fashion, or when applied in a burst, used as a weapon. As they do not use sound for communication they lack anything equivalent to ears, so to communicate with humans they use small translator boxes that are not very sensitive and cannot pick up whispers. Diddy, a nine-year-old boy, is on his first hunt for The Sound, a mysterious humming that can be heard for miles around the yards. Finding the source of The Sound has become a sort of treasure hunt for young boys. Diddy is younger than most for his first hunt. As he begins to explore the yard he is approached by a policeman that he immediately realizes is a Yved spy. The Yved tells him that he is worried that the bacterial defense system has become stale and will no longer work. He asks Diddy to cross into the yard and then return. When he does, the policeman takes a sample of his blood. After a quick test, the Yved crosses into the yard. Several more Yved join Diddy, disguised as boys on the hunt. As they explore the yard, they are approached by a young woman. She offers to tell them each a secret that will help them find The Sound. She whispers to Diddy that they have a plan to attack Yved. She tells him there is a gun hidden below a girder in a nearby building that he should retrieve while pretending to look for The Sound. He retrieves the gun and is then given further instructions through a low-volume speaker. It is explained the Yved cannot use their light communications system in the presence of fluorine, and that they have filled nearby buildings with this gas. Diddy is told to enter a nearby building and shoot everyone, they are all Yved spies. Diddy enters and begins shooting, and when the Yved attempt to return fire, they burst into flame. He moves from room to room until the building is cleared. With the threat ended, Diddy is allowed to leave. He joins a crowd of other boys watching the sun rise after a night of hunting for The Sound. Discussing it with another boy, Mart, they both realize they have found The Sound. It is the all-pervasive siren song of the entire shipyard put together. References Category:1950 short stories Category:Science fiction short stories Category:Short stories by A.

Parallel proverbs of similar meaning were later associated with it. The fable In the fable as Phaedrus tells it, after the lion had grown old and feeble, a boar and a bull took their revenge for past attacks by injuring him. But when a donkey joins in and kicks him, the lion laments that suffering insult from such a base creature is like a second death. Different animals figure in later accounts. For Marie de France in the 12th century, the bull that gores the lion and the ass that kicks him are joined by a fox that bites at his ears. In her version too, it is not simply that they take advantage of his loss of kingly power but that some of his courtiers have now forgotten past favours.Poésies de Marie de France, vol.2, Fable 15 In La Fontaine’s 1668 version the attacks come from a horse, a wolf and a bull, as well as the ass, but it ends with exactly the same sentiment as in Phaedrus.Fables, 3.14 La Fontaine’s choice of animals is influenced by a tag drawn from Horace, a frequent source for him. Used of the natural instinct of self defence, the Latin Dente lupus, cornu taurus petit (the wolf attacks with his teeth, the bull with his horns, Satires II.1.55) had become proverbial.A Companion to the Latin Language, Wiley-Blackwell 2011 The Neo-Latin poem “Leo Senex” by Hieronymus Osius shifted the emphasis to the pain that a formerly powerful human feels now that he cannot protect himself,Phryx Aesopus (1564), Fable 11 leaving the cautionary story as no more than a metaphor. William Caxton urged the necessity of humility in his retelling,Aesop's Fables (1484), 1.16 while tempering tyranny is counselled by other English authors, including Francis Barlow (1667),Fable 99 Roger L'Estrange (1692)Fable 15 and Samuel Croxall (1722).Fable 145 The English versions of La Fontaine’s fable which began to appear from early in the 18th century were also individual interpretations. That in Bernard de Mandeville’s Aesop Dress’d (1704) is largely an elegant paraphrase and ends with a clever pun.Fable 32, p.66 Charles Denis (Select Fables, 1754) translates the title as “The Old Lion”, adds an ape and a fox to the attackers and ends on a new moral, summed up in the line “be good as you are great”.Fable 79, pp. 287-8 The moral stanza added by John Matthews (London 1820) is given a topical twist by being applied to the conduct of politicians and pamphleteers during the madness of King George III.pp. 204-7 Of Ivan Krylov's two Russian versions of the fable published in 1825, \\"The Aged Lion\\" was faithful to La Fontaine's. The second, \\"The Fox and the Ass\\", was more of an adaptation: there the Ass boasts of his deed in conversation with a Fox afterwards and the moral drawn at the end is that the most lowly and sycophantic people will be the first to settle scores once the tables are turned. More modern reinterpretations of La Fontaine’s fable have included Ladislas Starevich’s film using animated puppets (1932)You Tube and several musical settings: by Louis Lacombe as part of his 15 melodies (op. 72, 1875); by Florent Schmitt in his Fables sans morales (Op.130, 1954); and by Isabelle Aboulker in Les Fables Enchantées (2004).You Tube Proverbs Charles Pinot’s illustration of La Fontaine's fable, 1860 The line from Horace inserted by La Fontaine into his Le lion devenu vieux was far from the only Latin proverb associated with the fable. The meaning of two more parallel the fable’s moral that those who lose power must suffer from those they had tyrannised previously. One concerns the false valour of tearing the beard of a dead lion (barbam vellere mortuo leoni) that reappears, among other places, as an insult in Shakespeare’s play King John (2.i): :You are the hare of whom the proverb goes, :Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard.Wordsworth Dictionary of Proverbs, 2007, p.266 The other proverb also concerned the hare, traditionally the most timorous of beasts, and spread to the rest of Europe from an epigram in the suspect version of the Greek Anthology edited by Maximus Planudes. In this the defeated Hector recalls that even a hare will leap on a dead lionGeorge Burges’ edition, London 1854, poem 68 in a line that was later imitated by Andrea Alciato in the poem accompanying his emblem on the futility of wrestling with the dead.Emblem 154 The same proverb was later adapted into a fable by Pieter de la Court in his Sinryke Fabulen (Amsterdam, 1685). His version is prefaced by the Latin equivalent, mortuo leone et lepores insultant, and tells how a selection of animals take their revenge on the dead beast, including wolves, bears, foxes and apes. Finally a hare leaps on the corpse and tears at the beard.Sinryke Fabulen, pp.207ff While this fable retains scarcely a detail from those of Phaedrus or La Fontaine, its dependence on them is unmistakable. The popularity of La Fontaine’s fables gave rise to still more proverbs that alluded to them, most notably in this case, le coup de pied de l’âne.Le Roux de Lincy, Le livre des proverbes français, Paris 1859, II.512 There were even dialect equivalents such as the Picard L’caup d’ pied du baudet, which is glossed in the dictionary that records it as a cowardly insult to someone from whom one has nothing to fear.Joseph Dejardin, Dictionnaire des spots ou proverbes wallons, Liège 1863, p.371 But the fable’s title itself eventually came to be used proverbially, for example as the title of a novel by Ernest Feydeau (Paris 1872) and a historical play by Jean Schlumberger (Paris, 1924). Poetically it appeared as a refrain in a ballade by Alexandre Marie,Le jovial du midi: chansonnier, Toulouse 1840, p.80 a mourning of lost powers that has more or less the same theme as Starevich’s film. Similarly the fallen Baron Haussmann justified himself in the poem Confessions d’un lion devenu vieux (Paris 1888).Paris, capitale du XIXème siècle, p.43 References External links * Illustrations from 16th – 19th centuries Category:Aesop's Fables Category:La Fontaine's Fables Category:Emblem books Category:Proverbs Category:Fictional lions ","title":"The Lion Grown Old"},{"id":"51863702","text":"Francesco Ricci may refer to: * Francesco Ricci (mathematician), Italian economist and mathematician * Francesco Pasquale Ricci (1732–1817), Italian composer and violinist * Francesco Ricci (politician), Italian politician, former mayor of Chieti ","title":"Francesco Ricci"},{"id":"51863718","text":"The Bregman-Lagrangian framework permits a systematic understanding of the matching rates associated with higher-order gradient methods in discrete and continuous time.

Biography  Stamatios Kapsas was born in the village of Pazarakia (now Kryopigi, Chalkidiki) in the late 18th century. At an early age he moved to Sykia to find work, but quickly came into conflict with the local Ottoman authorities, and became a klepht active in the region of Sithonia, Mount Cholomon, and the Chasikochoria (modern Polygyros area). By the time of the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821, he was serdar (watchman) of the central administrative body of the monasteries of Mount Athos at Karyes. On 23 March 1821, with the aid of ship captains from Psara and Ainos, Emmanouil Pappas landed on Athos with guns and ammunition. After meeting with Kapsas, they began forming an army. Supported by the Metropolitan of Maroneia Konstantios, they gathered 1,000 armed monks, while Kapsas roamed Chalkidiki, where he enjoyed great prestige due to his activity as a klepht, to rally more men to their cause. The men he gathered came mostly from the Sithonia and Kassandra peninsulas and the Chasikochoria, especially from Sykia. Kapsas' army quickly swelled to 2,000 men. The Ottomans, disquieted by the rapid spread of the revolt, launched pogroms against the Greek populace in Thessaloniki and its vicinity, thereby leading to the spread of the revolt with uprisings occurring throughout the modern Thessaloniki and Serres prefectures. In view of these developments, on 17 May Pappas officially proclaimed the Greek Revolution in northern Greece. The rebel army was split in two: Pappas with the monks and the men of the Mademochoria (the twelve villages around the silver mines in eastern Chalkidiki) moved east towards Rentina to confront the Ottoman troops moving to suppress the rebellion from Thrace, while Kapsas (with Anastasios Chymeftos as deputy commander) and his 2,000 men moved west to capture Thessaloniki. From Athos, Kapsas moved through the villages of Chalkidiki to Vasilika and Thermi, where the rebels set up camp (8 June 1821) to prepare for the assault on Thessaloniki. On the same day, Kapsas' men confronted and defeated the Ottoman cavalry near the modern American Agricultural School, under Ahmed Bey of Giannitsa, in which the Greeks were victorious, forcing the Ottomans to retreat to Thessaloniki. The Austrian consul in the city reported at the time that \\"even here disorder is spreading. The anxiety and fear, whether the Greeks should strike at the city from both land and sea, is widespread, although the government has taken the richest and most influential Greeks as hostages.\\" In the meantime, however, Pappas had encountered the Ottoman reinforcements coming from Drama and Constantinople and was driven back after battles at Rentina and Apollonia. With only 200 men remaining, he sped west to unite with Kapsas. The latter, informed of the dire situation in the east, retreated to Vasilika, where he united with Pappas' men. In Thessaloniki, Ebu Lubut Pasha had gathered an overwhelming army of 30,000 foot and 5,000 horse, and moved to meet the rebels. Kapsas chose to give battle at the narrow valley of Anthemountas river, near the Monastery of St. Anastasia, but detached Chymeftos with some of his men to cover the Kassandra peninsula against a possible landing of Ottoman troops by sea in his rear. The ensuing battle at Vasilika quickly turned into a disaster for the Greeks, especially after the Ottoman troops began massacring the inhabitants of the village. The local magnate Georgios Kotzias then suggested that the rebels should barricade themselves in the Monastery of St. Anastasia, but the monks would only allow the non-combatants to enter the monastery. Kapsas remained in the field with just 67 men to delay the Ottomans, while Pappas with the remaining army covered the civilians' flight to the monastery. Kapsas and his 67 men were killed to the last. A monument at the site commemorates their sacrifice.

She was a student of Walter Sickert. Nellie Burton, by Wendela Boreel  Training and early career  The daughter of a Dutch diplomat, Jonkheer Boreel, and an American mother, Edith Margaret (née Ives), Boreel grew up in England and attended the Slade School of Fine Art. Boreel's first interest at Slade was in drawing. She began attending evening classes at the Westminster Technical Institute where she was discovered by Sickert. He gave her access to a studio in Mornington Crescent where she began painting. Boreel's first solo exhibit was in 1919 at Walker's Gallery. She also held shows at the New English Art Club and as part of Frank Rutter’s Allied Artists’ Association and the London Group. However, her earliest successes were in etching and she was elected to the Royal Society of Etchers in 1923.  Tite street  Boreel and her parents lived on Tite Street and she became friends with Frank Schuster and met John Singer Sargent, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Edward Elgar, Siegfried Sassoon, W. B. Yeats, Thomas Hardy, Roger Fry, Glyn Philpot and Martin Hardie.  \\"The hut\\"  In 1919 Frank Schuster introduced Boreel to Leslie George Wylde (nicknamed Anzy), a cavalary officer who had lost a leg during the Gallipoli Campaign. Boreel and Wyle married and Schuster invited them to live in \\"the Hut\\", his country estate in Bray, Berkshire. Siegfried Sasson described Boreel as \\"delightful\\" and said she was \\"the only serious element\\" at Bray. Boreel's etching of Sassoon is held at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. When Schuster died in 1927 he left the estate to Wylde and Boreel.  Later years  Wylde died in 1935 and Boreel moved to France. She escaped to the United States with her son at the onset of World War Two. She returned to France after the war.

From then on episode titles were based on jokes from on the conversations within the episodes. While the show traditionally consists only of Kilgariff, Hardstark and producer Steven Ray Morris, few episodes have featured guest appearances. Past guests have included Guy Branum, Paul Holes, Patton Oswalt, Bellamy Young, Conan O'Brien, and Cameron Britton. Additionally, My Favorite Murder has collaborated with other podcasts, including the Cracked Podcast, Unqualified with Anna Faris, The Dollop, Harmontown, and Movie Crush. Karen Kilgariff was also on Mother, May I Sleep With Podcast in an episode on the Flowers in the Attic (2014 film) movie. Full episodes are released weekly on Thursdays, ranging in length from 60–120 minutes. \\"Minisodes\\" are released Mondays, and are typically 30–45 minutes long. Initially \\"Minisodes\\" focused solely on the topic of \\"Hometown Murders\\", which include listeners' personal connections or experiences with crime submitted via email. \\"Minisodes\\" have since expanded to also include topics such as the paranormal, hidden objects, family secrets, first responder stories, or whatever topics the hosts have requested. Kilgariff and Hardstark have both referred to the podcast as a sort of therapy to deal with their own anxieties about true crime. Both hosts strive to emphasize compassion for both the victims and perpetrators of the crimes they discuss. They often discuss common problematic themes in true crime, such as mental illness, sex work, sexual abuse, religion, women, and victim's rights. Within the discussion of the crimes, they also discuss personal experiences and anecdotes. These topics often include previous substance abuse, rehab, Irish Catholicism, Judaism, sobriety, therapy/mental health, epilepsy, stand-up comedy, and growing up in California. Each episode ends with the hosts saying their catchphrase \\"Stay Sexy and Don't Get Murdered.\\" Hardstark then asks her siamese cat Elvis: \\"Elvis, want a cookie?\\" and he meows into the microphone as the episode ends. After their move to the Exactly Right offices, Hardstark recorded Elvis on her phone at home, and it was then added to the end of the podcast.  Reactions and response  My Favorite Murder was swiftly syndicated beyond the original Feral Audio site to such places as Google Play Music and iTunes. Media reaction to the program has been largely positive, with the phenomenon of the podcast's rapid popularity documented in many outside sources such as BuzzFeed, Rolling Stone, Marie Claire, HuffPost, and Bustle. As of October 5, 2016, My Favorite Murder was #10 on the overall iTunes podcast charts and #1 in the comedy category and has around 450,000 downloads per episode, and millions of downloads each month. Elle invited Hardstark to write about the JonBenét Ramsey case following The Case of: JonBenét Ramsey to discuss her reaction and share her theories on the case. On February 21, 2017, The Atlantic published the article titled \\"How a True-Crime Podcast Became a Mental-Health Support Group\\" which discusses the \\"Murderino\\" community built around taking care of yourself, and how stories of murders have come to help listeners exorcise their fears. The show has faced some criticism, notably with regard to their treatment of topics relating to marginalized groups (such as sex workers, people of color, and the LGBTQ community) and factual inaccuracies. Many episodes include a \\"Corrections Corner\\" segment to address criticisms or correct inaccuracies from previous episodes. In 2020 Forbes named them #2 on their first-ever ranking of the highest-earning podcasters. In 2020 My Favorite Murder earned $15 million.  Murderinos and Fan Cult  My Favorite Murder quickly gained a large fan following, including a Facebook group with over 200,000 members , and a Facebook fan page with more than 171,000 followers . Of note is the predominance of female listeners and fans, which is consistent with data showing the majority of true crime fans to be female. Fans of the show refer to themselves as Murderinos, which has been defined as: \\"Person with a borderline obsessive interest in true crime, and the specific nature and details of disturbing murders.\\" Fans frequently create art and merchandise featuring show quotes. Hardstark's cat, a siamese cat named Elvis, has also garnered much attention from the fandom due to his prominent meow and distinctly crossed eyes. Elvis is also frequently featured in fan art, and often acts as a mascot for the show. The term \\"Murderino\\" is inspired by a Ned Flanders line from a Halloween episode of The Simpsons. On April 12, 2018 My Favorite Murder announced their new platform for fans called the Fan Cult. For a yearly fee, fans are granted access to exclusive merchandise, pre-sale of live show tickets, additional content, as well as forums. In November 2019, My Favorite Murder hosted a weekend-long event called \\"My Favorite Weekend\\" in Santa Barbara, California. The event featured meet and greets, an art exhibit, exclusive merchandise, and live shows from the Exactly Right network.  I'll Be Gone in the Dark  I'll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer is a true crime book by Michelle McNamara about the Golden State Killer. The book and McNamara's work on the case are frequently discussed in My Favorite Murder, which boasts a large fan base of true crime aficionado. The debut episode of the show \\"Episode 1: My Firstest Murder\\" featured the case as well as discussion of McNamara's work. Prior to the arrest, \\"Episode 115: I'll Be Gone In The Dark at Skylight Books\\" featured McNamara's widower Patton Oswalt, Paul Haynes, and Billy Jensen discussing the book and their roles in finishing project following McNamara's death. In this episode Oswalt discusses McNamara's writing process including making \\"era-appropriate playlists to help her get into a proper mindset\\". Oswalt explains finishing of the book as a bittersweet experience: \\"It’s another part of her that’s kind of gone. In a very a sick way, not having the book done—and us working on it—meant she was still here.” \\"Episode 118: Golden State Serial Killer Caught\\" released on April 26, 2018 (immediately after the arrest was made) featured Billy Jensen discussing the arrest and his work on the book following McNamara's death. \\"Episode 122: Surprise! It's Paul Holes\\" featured Billy Jensen and Golden State Killer investigator Paul Holes discussing the case and the impact of McNamara's work. Following their involvement in the Golden State Killer case and McNamara's work, in 2019 Billy Jensen and Paul Holes began a podcast called Jensen & Holes: The Murder Squad, produced through Kilgariff and Hardstark's podcast network Exactly Right. Stay Sexy and Don't Get Murdered Hosts Kilgariff and Hardstark cowrote a book entitled Stay Sexy and Don't Get Murdered that was released on May 28, 2019 by Forge Books. The book is a dual memoir, framed by their signature focus on true crime. The book title is a reference to the podcast's catchphrase. Exactly Right Podcast Network In November 2018, Kilgariff and Hardstark departed from Earwolf and launched the Exactly Right Podcast Network. The name Exactly Right is in reference to a phrase often said by Kilgrariff in the show, \\"That's exactly right\\". In addition to producing My Favorite Murder, the network began hosting the pre-existing shows The Fall Line, The Purrrcast, This Podcast Will Kill You, and Do You Need A Ride?. In 2019 Exactly Right podcast Jensen & Holes: The Murder Squad was announced, which was the first show original to the network. The show is hosted by retired cold case investigator Paul Holes and investigative journalist Billy Jensen. Jensen and Holes discuss \\"unsolved murders, unidentified remains, and missing persons cases\\" with contributions from their listeners. Both Jensen and Holes gained notoriety within the My Favorite Murder fan community following their involvement in the Golden State Killer case in 2018. Additional podcasts hosted by the network include I Said No Gifts, in which comedian Bridger Winegar has conversations with guests who have brought him supposedly unwanted gifts and Bananas, wherein Kurt Braunohler and Scotty Landes discuss the strange news from around the world. Episodes Live shows The hosts have done several live shows internationally that follow the same format of the podcast, starting in September 2016. Vince Averill, Hardstark's husband, acts as the tour manager and travels with the show. Live shows are often posted in place of new episodes. My Favorite Murder is the top-selling podcast live show.

She was the wife of the writer Ignazio Silone from 1944 until his death in 1978 . Life Born in Rathgar, Dublin, Laracy had three sisters Cecily, Moira and Eithne, she graduated in 1937 in history and political science from University College Dublin. By 1939 Laracy had an MA. She went to France where she had a scholarship to study for her doctorate at the Sorbonne. In 1940 she moved to Italy, visiting Milan briefly and then settling in Rome where she got work as a correspondent for the Herald Tribune and the International News Service. This brought her attention from the fascist regime who wanted her to collaborate with them. When she refused she was forced to flee to Switzerland. Laracy was initially based in Berne where she gave a full account to the chief intelligence officer. However her visa was for 15 days and eventually she could not get a further extension. She moved to Zurich when an English publisher commissioned her to write a book on the situation in Italy. It was in the libraries there that she met Ignazio Silone, who was also in exile. She convinced Silone to let her assist him in his work against the fascist regime in Italy and eventually, in October 1944, they returned to Rome. They were married two months later. Capable of speaking six languages Laracy worked on the translations of his works and after his death she used his notes to complete the unfinished novel Severina.

This was the fourth generation railcar in the Silverliner family of single level EMUs and it is currently used by Philadelphia's SEPTA Regional Rail. The 232 car order of Silverliner IV cars, delivered between 1973 and 1976, represented the largest order of the Silverliner series to date and allowed for the retirement of most of the Reading 'Blueliner' and PRR MP54 MU cars, dating from at least the 1930s, that were still running on their respective Reading and Pennsylvania Railroad systems. Three times the size of the previous Silverliner orders put together, the Silverliner IVs became SEPTA's standard passenger rail vehicle from 1976 on. Like the Silverliner IIs and IIIs before them, the IVs were owned by SEPTA and provided to the private railroads for use in their state supported commuter rail operations until SEPTA took over direct operation in 1983.  Features  The cars were ordered from General Electric and Avco. Aside from the boxier look and smaller side windows, the main changes between the new IVs and earlier Silverliners included a dynamic brake system, for which the resistance grids were fitted in the car's signature roof hump, and, for the Penn Central cars, a trainline automatic door system which removed the need for train crew to manually open doors at high level platforms. The Silverliner IVs were also the first to be delivered in a married pair configuration, although a minority of cars were outfitted as single units. The delivery of the Silverliner IVs allowed SEPTA to replace most of its remaining PRR MP54s and Reading's pre-war MU fleet save for the 38 rebuilt \\"Blueliner\\" cars. While being fitted with an updated propulsion system from General Electric, the Silverliner IVs were nevertheless still delivered with Ignitron tube rectifiers, which were later replaced with silicon controlled rectifiers. A readily apparent external feature of the Silverliner IV is a windowed body panel plug in the middle of the cars on each side, a provision for high-platform-only center doors which have never been installed, in contrast with New Jersey Transit's similar, contemporary Arrow II and III cars which were built with such doors. Internally, pairs of seats occupy this partitioned area which was intended for passenger flow.  Delivery  The Reading got the first batch of Silverliner IVs in the form of 14 single unit cars produced during 1973. The first two (#9018 and #9019) were unveiled to the press on Thursday, February 21, 1974. These were numbered in series with their existing Silverliner IIs, 9018 through 9031. In 1974-75 the Penn Central took delivery of 34 single units numbered 270 through 303. Delivery of the Silverliner IVs were briefly interrupted by the production of 70 Arrow II cars for the New Jersey Department of Transportation before the Penn Central received 96 pairs numbered 304 through 399. Finally in 1976 the Reading took delivery of a final batch of 88 pairs numbered 101 through 188. All the IVs were delivered with the circular SEPTA logo on the left, and the Penn Central or Reading logo on the right, of all car sides and ends, although the Reading black diamond logo was omitted (and the space left blank) on cars 129-188 which were delivered after the Reading Company was absorbed into Conrail on April 1, 1976. These logos remained mostly intact until 1983, when SEPTA took over commuter rail operations from Conrail and quickly began applying its current rectangular logo over all the others.  Modifications  SEPTA GE Silverliner IV at Bryn Mawr, PA, interlockingThe Silverliner IVs have never been officially rebuilt, but there have been a number of modifications to the class. The propulsion system was initially upgraded from the original mercury arc–based Ignitron rectifiers to more reliable solid state silicon controlled rectifiers and later the main transformers had their coolant replaced with one that did not contain PCBs. As this change was carried out in the early 1990s, all of the 9000 series Reading cars and some of the Penn Central cars were renumbered into the series 400 through 460 to help keep track of which units had undergone the modification. When the Center City Commuter Connection opened in 1984, the Reading cars were converted to full train automatic door operation to take advantage of the high level platforms at the new Market East Station (now Jefferson Station) and others on the former PRR \\"side\\" of the system. In the late 1990s the fleet received its most noticeable upgrade with the original \\"ketchup and mustard\\" colored interior replaced with a softer gray motif as well as softer seating. Around 2004 SEPTA began to replace the cowcatcher pilots equipped on the original Reading cars with a bar type pilot to match those on the PRR cars. Starting in 2009 SEPTA began to replace the original Faiveley pantographs with more modern Schunk type units.  Service history  The Silverliner IV fleet has provided service on all of SEPTA's Regional Rail routes, providing the backbone of SEPTA's service plan, with older equipment tending to be used on peak services only.

The single units are most frequently coupled to pairs to make 5 or 3 car trainsets, although single units are run alone on Cynwyd Line service.

E. van Vogt, originally published in Astounding in 1944. It is a light-hearted look at the first manned mission to Venus, a \\"science puzzle\\" or \\"problem story\\" that requires the protagonist to think his way out of a thorny situation. Included in several anthologies, it was also made into a short film in 2004. Plot The protagonist lands on Venus, the first man to successfully make the journey without falling into the Sun. Exiting the ship to begin exploring, he notices a cube-like object with a handle on it just outside the door. He picks it up and it speaks to him through mind telepathy. \\"I contain paint...\\" is all he manages to hear before a small amount squirts out onto his shirt and he drops the cube. The paint glows and has all the colors of a rainbow. He soon notices that the paint is spreading, and when he removes his shirt it jumps onto his skin. When he attempts to rub it off, it flows back on. He then attempts to use various chemicals to remove it, using every solvent he can find and even some of his precious rocket fuel. None of these work, so he tries a screw-top container which he uses to scoop it off, locking it within so it cannot flow back. After filling part of a bucket, he notices that there is no less paint on him than before – it appears to be self-repairing. He also notices that he is growing extremely hot, as it is also a powerful insulator. He is bemused by the fact that this paint appears to be perfect; it comes in all colors, applies itself, repairs itself, and insulates as well. Unfortunately that insulation quality will kill him due to overheating, long before the equally worrying possibility of it covering his body completely. Thinking about the problem, he realizes that such a perfect paint had to be manufactured by an advanced technology. He turns on his radio and is quickly contacted by the Venusians. They explain that their bodies are so hideous that they are afraid the sight of them will drive humans mad. They have developed the can of paint with human telepathy at great expense as a sort of IQ test, and that if he lives through test and is also able to look at them, any following visitor with his IQ or better will be allowed in. After apologizing for all the bother, they disconnect. Careful not to lift the cube again, he places his hand on the handle and it begins \\"I contain 2/3rds paint... \\" and then goes on to read out a complete list of ingredients and application instructions. The primary ingredient is liquid light, and the instructions say it can be easily removed by applying darkness paste. Initially finding this amusing because he does not know where the hardware store is, he suddenly realizes he has a solution. The action continues with him on his way back to Earth, talking on the radio to another ship making the journey. He explains that he lined his fuel tank with solar cells, capturing the light given off from the paint while blocking any light from outside falling on it. It eventually runs out of energy and falls off as a powder. He mentions that he is returning with his ship completely filled with cans of this indestructible, self-applying, insulating perfect paint, with which he hopes to make his fortune. Publication The story was first published in Astounding in September 1944, at the height of van Vogt's short-story efforts. It was included in Destination: Universe! in 1952, and in Transfinite: The Essential A.E. van Vogt in 2003. Although it is not as well known as van Vogt's stories like \\"Far Centaurus\\", it is widely commented on in off-topic references. Damon Knight's dismissive review of van Vogt's works singles out the story as one to be ridiculed. He notes: The complaint is ironic, given that solar cells were invented less than a decade later, and their first use was for spacecraft. They remain a common fixture of practically every spacecraft to this day. Movie The story was adapted to the screen by Winston Engle, and filmed by director Robi Michael in 2004. The story remains very similar to the original, although the setting is moved from Venus to a derelict spaceship found in deep space. The protagonist, Kilgour (played by Aaron Robson) speaks only to his ship's computer (voiced by Jean Franzblau), but the action remains otherwise faithful to the original.

She is a part of the music duo Sshh with musician Zak Starkey.  Early life  Sshh Liguz was born on 10 September 1984 in Bondi, New South Wales, Australia, where she grew up with an interest in entertainment and the arts. As a teenager, she wrote reviews and hosted a radio show before attending Bradfield College of the Arts and eventually the National Art School. In school, Liguz began playing with various bands in Australia, and became more interested in performing than attending art classes with their strict structure. Liguz dropped out of art school and moved to England looking for her next path. Liguz eventually met musician Zak Starkey at a show, and they began making music together. They began collaborating when Starkey was touring as the drummer for Oasis. Starkey sent Sshh a guitar riff which she added on to, leading to their first song recorded over the phone. They started releasing material in 2006 under the name Pengu!ns, with Starkey on drums, Sshh on vocals, Shane Devany on guitar, and Tatia Starkey on bass. The project name comes from the lyric ‘Penguins start your engines’ from their song ‘Jet Engines.’ The group began playing live together in 2008, and in 2011, the touring Pengu!ns lineup consisted solely of Sshh and Starkey as a duo. They now both reside in London, UK.  Sshh  The duo continued making music together in London with Zak on guitar and Liguz on vocals under the name Sshh. They were asked to do a SiriusXM series discussing their musical influences. Instead of simply discussing individual songs, the duo decided to take a different approach to the series by inviting original members of the rhythm sections of the influential bands to play with them and record.

The epicenter was likely located in the southern Aegean Sea. Reports note that many cities were flooded by the sea, presumably due to a tsunami. Nicholas Ambraseys, who performed the most comprehensive assessment of ancient earthquakes in the Mediterranean, traces the original source of most literary references to this quake to an account in the Augustan History purportedly written by Trebellius Pollio. This source is problematic, as the veracity of much of its supposed biographical details is doubtful. However, there is some reason to give credence to the history's accounts of natural disasters. Trebellius's account also reports the southwest Anatolia earthquake in conjunction with one that hit Cyrene, Libya the same year. The two events appears to have been unrelated, but it has been difficult for historians to disentangle the exact effects of each based on the classical sources. Tectonic setting There are many faults in the Aegean Sea and the adjacent coastal areas of Anatolia, caused by the African Plate being subducted beneath the Aegean Sea Plate. These faults result in frequent earthquakes. Ephesus, which sustained considerable damage in the 262 AD earthquake, was also struck by earthquakes in AD 17, sometime before AD 30, c. AD 42, c. AD 46–47, c. 150–155, 358–366, 614, and the tenth or eleventh century. One fault in the southern part of the region stretches from the island of Rhodes in present-day Greece northeastwards to Burdur in present-day Turkey. Damage Trebellius wrote that the cities of Roman Asia reported the worst damage from the earthquake: \\"In many places the earth yawned open, and salt water appeared in the fissures. Many cities were even overwhelmed by the sea.\\" He records that this damage occurred took place during the consulship of Gallienus and Fausianus. The latter appears to be Lucius Mummius Faustianus who was a consul in the year 262. Much of the Library of Celsus at Ephesus (including all the books) were destroyed by fire in or around 262. The cause of the fire has been attributed either to this earthquake or to an invasion by the Goths (sometimes incorrectly identified as Scythians). Ephesus's Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was also destroyed around the same date, although some sources attribute this to a Gothic invasion in 267 or 268. There is some archeological evidence at Ephesus supporting the date implied by Trebellius's account. Stefan Karwiese of the Austrian Archaeological Institute at Athens reports that ceramics found near the library and temple can be dated to the second half of the third century. A study of geological processes in Roman cities concludes that 11 major buildings at Ephesus required rebuilding after the 262 earthquake: the terrace houses, Temple of Serapis (Serapeion), Stoa of Damianus, Harbor Baths (also known as the Great Baths or Baths of Constantius), Baths of Varius and Scholastica Baths, Magnesian Gate, Medusa Gate, Lower Agora (also known as the Tetragonos Agora), Library of Celsus, theatre and stadium. Account by \\"Trebellius Pollio\\" The Augustan History contains a biography of Gallienus titled \\"The Two Gallieni\\" and ascribed to Trebellius Pollio, likely a pseudonym. The writer appears to have been aiming to retrospectively malign the character of Gallienus. Among the descriptions of his frivolity and military defeats is a section that relates several natural disasters of the time. Romans frequently saw these as omens and it was not unusual to conflate several events from the same year.

However, during the 17th century, Parliament permitted a Land Tax to be collected from 1667, a Hearth tax from 1691-1695 and a Poll tax from 1693-1699. The 1707 Union of the Kingdom of Scotland with the Kingdom of England formed a new Kingdom of Great Britain, so that responsibility for taxation in Scotland became a matter for the Westminster Parliament, now the legislature for the new state. = Devolution of tax powers = The creation of a devolved Scottish parliament in 1999 was accompanied by a limited transfer of taxation powers: the Scotland Act 1998 transferred the power to legislate for local taxation and also the power to vary income tax by plus or minus 3 pence in the pound. Most taxation powers in Scotland following the creation of the parliament remained a reserved matter for Westminster. Following the Calman Commission, the Scotland Act 2012 transferred powers over Stamp duty Land Tax, and Landfill Tax (both since replaced by Land and Buildings Transaction Tax and Scottish Landfill Tax, respectively) and reduced rates of Income tax in Scotland by 10 pence in the pound at all bands, reducing the Barnett formula by the equivalent sum, and requiring the Scottish parliament to set a Scottish Income tax rate to replace the lost revenue but with the ability to set it higher or lower than 10 pence in the pound if it wished. Following promises made during the Scottish independence referendum that led to the Smith Commission, the Scotland Act 2016 added powers over Air Passenger Duty and full over Income tax on non savings and non dividend income (excluding the personal allowance which is still set by the UK parliament.) Despite these tax powers having been transferred, over half of all taxes collected in Scotland remains under the direct control of the UK parliament which has remained a reserved matter to itself all powers over Corporation tax, National Insurance, Value-added tax (VAT), Capital gains tax, Inheritance tax, Aggregates Levy Insurance Premium Tax and Motoring taxes.

He ruled the Sapadalaksha country, which included parts of present-day Rajasthan in north-western India. Arnoraja repulsed a Ghaznavid invasion from the west, and also defeated several neighbouring Hindu kings including the Paramaras and the Tomaras. He had to face defeats against the Chaulukyas, and was ultimately killed by his own son, Jagaddeva.  Early life  Arnoraja was a son of the Chahamana king Ajayaraja II and his wife Somalladevi. He is known by various names, including Analadeva, Ānaladeva, Ana, Anna, and Ānāka. Two 1139 CE Revasa inscriptions mention his title as Maharajadhiraja-Parameshvara. An 1141 CE manuscript of Avashyaka-Niryukti mentions his title as Paramabhattaraka-Maharajadhiraja- Shrimad.  Military career  = Paramaras = The Bijolia rock inscription boasts that Arnoraja humiliated Nirvvana-Naryana, which was an epithet of the Paramara ruler Naravarman. Arnoraja's father Ajayaraja II had defeated Naravarman, so this incident may have taken place when Arnoraja was a prince. The Ajmer prashasti (eulogy) inscription also begins with a mention of Naravarman, but the verse is incomplete. Four lines later, it states that Arnoraja's warriors captured the elephants of the Malwa king (Malavesha). Historian Dasharatha Sharma believes that this king of Malwa was Naravarman. According to R. B. Singh, this probably refers to Arnoraja's military success against Naravarman's successor Yashovarman. = Tomaras = The Ajmer prashasti inscription also states that Arnoraja's soldiers marched to Haritanaka (modern Haryana). Their invasion rendered the waters of the Kalindi river muddy, and caused the women of that country to shed tears. This appears to be a reference to Arnoraja's invasion of the Tomara kingdom. Arnoraja seems to have defeated the Tomaras, but this victory was not decisive, as his son Vigraharaja IV also had to fight against the Tomaras. = Turushkas = The Ana Sagar lake in Ajmer is named after Arnoraja alias Ana According to the Ajmer prashasti inscription Arnoraja adorned Ajmer with the blood of Turushkas (Turkic people). The Prithviraja Vijaya also states that Arnoraja repulsed a Muslim invasion. According to the text, these invaders came through the desert, and had to drink the blood of their horses in absence of water. After defeating these invaders, Arnoraja purified the place of their death by commissioning a lake, which is identified with the modern Ana Sagar. The lake was filled with the water of the Chandra river, identified with the modern Bandi River. Historian H. C. Ray theorized that the Muslim invaders defeated by Arnoraja were the Yamini (Ghaznavid) generals of Lahore. However, R. B. Singh identifies the invader as the Ghaznavid king Bahram Shah himself. The 13th century Muslim chronicle Tabaqat-i Nasiri states that a chief named Muhammad Bahalim once revolted against Bahram Shah. Bahalim is said to have built the Nagaur fort. Bahram Shah marched towards India to defeat Bahalim, who also set out from Nagaur with his army. The two armies met at Multan, where Bahalim was defeated and killed. Bahram Shah then left for Ghazna to fight the Ghurids. R. B. Singh speculates that after revolting against Bahram Shah, Bahalim sought asylum with the Chahamanas. Arnoraja granted him the fief of Nagaur. After defeating Bahalim, Bahram Shah may have attempted to subdue Arnoraja, but was defeated. The Muslim chronicles probably omitted this event to avoid recording Bahram Shah's defeat. = Chaulukyas of Gujarat =  Jayasimha Siddharaja  Arnoraja's reign saw a revival of the Chahamana- Chaulukya conflict, probably as a result of their attempts to control the weakening Paramara kingdom of Malwa. This conflict appears to have ended with an advantage to the Gujarat Chaulukya king Jayasimha Siddharaja. According to the Gujarat scholar Hemachandra's Dvyashraya, Ānā of Sapadalaksha (that is, Arnoraja), bent his head before Jayasimha. A Sambhar (Shakambhari) inscription provides a genealogy of the Chaulukya kings, from Mularaja to Jayasimha. It mentions Sambhar, which indicates that Jayasimha may have even occupied the Chahamana capital for a brief period. Kirti Kaumidi also states that Jayasimha defeated Arnoraja, but adds that Jayasimha gave his daughter Kanchana in marriage to Arnoraja. Someshvara, the son of Arnoraja and Kanchana, was brought up at the Chaulukya court in Gujarat. The matrimonial alliance probably ended the conflict for a short period, but the Chaulukya-Chahamana conflict resumed after Jayasimha's death.  Kumarapala  After Jayasimha's death, a war of succession took place between his nominee and adopted son Chahada (also Bahada or Charudatta), and his relative Kumarapala. Chahada formed an alliance with Arnoraja and other princes, and instigated them to fight Kumarapala, as attested by several sources, including Dvyashraya, Kumarapala Charita, and Prabandha-Chintamani. According to Merutunga, the author of Prabandha Chintamani, Arnoraja attacked Gujarat because he thought of Kumarapala as a weaker ruler than Jayasimha. Historian A. K. Majumdar speculates that Arnoraja may have planned to replace Kumarapala with his son Someshvara. According to the Kumarapala Charita, Arnoraja was defeated in this war, having suffered from an arrow shot in his face. The war appears to have ended with a matrimonial alliance: Arnoraja's daughter Jahlana married Kumarapala. According to later Jain legends, Kumarapala's sister Devalladevi also married Arnoraja. However, the existence of Devalladevi is doubtful. Despite the conflict, Kumarapala treated Arnoraja's son Someshvara (who lived with the Chaulukyas) well. Sometime around 1150 CE, there appears to have been a second war between Arnoraja and Kumarapala. According to the Jain chroniclers of Gujarat, such as Jayasimha Suri, Rajashekhara and Jina- Mandana, Arnoraja once insulted Jains while playing chess with his wife Devalladevi. Rajashekhara's Prabandha Kosha states that while taking away a pawn of his wife, Arnoraja remarked \\"Kill these Mundikas\\" in jest. This offended her, because Mundika (literally \\"bald\\") could refer to the tonsured Shvetambara Jain gurus. Devalladevi, a devout Jain and a sister of Kumarapala, asked her brother to avenge this insult. A. K. Majumdar pointed out that Kumarapala converted to Jainism at a later date, so the legend about his sister getting offended by Arnoraja appears to be historically inaccurate. According to Dasharatha Sharma, Devalladevi is a fictional character created by either Rajashekhara or another Jain writer, as none of the chronicles written before 14th century mention her. According to Majumdar, Arnoraja probably invaded the Chaulukya kingdom taking advantage of Kumarapala's involvement in other conflicts. This second war also ended with Arnoraja's defeat. Kumarapala's victory over Arnoraja is corroborated by multiple Chaulukya inscriptions. = Other campaigns = The Bijolia rock inscription states that Arnoraja retaliated against the Kusha-Varana (Kuśa-Varaṇa) kingdom. The identity of this kingdom is not certain. Historian A. K. Vyas theorized that Kusha and Varana were two separate kingdoms. He identified Kusha with Kannauj, and Varana with Bulandshahr. Historian R. B. Singh points out that Kannauj was ruled by the Gahadavala king Govindachandra, and it would not have been an easy task for Arnoraja to attack such a powerful kingdom. According to Dasharatha Sharma, in proper context, the term \\"kusha\\" means \\"sinful\\"; the inscription characterizes the Varanaa kingdom as a sinful one. Sharma theorizes that the Varana kingdom was ruled by Dod Rajputs, whose king was either Sahajaditya or Bhojadeva. The Ajmer prashasti inscription states that Arnoraja reached the Sindhu and the Sarasvati rivers. In absence of other information, the details of this expedition are not clear.  Death  Arnoraja had at least four sons. Of these, Someshvara was born of Kanchana, the Chaulukya princess of Gujarat. The other three were born of Sudhava, the princess of Marwar: Jagaddeva, Vigraharaja IV and Devadatta. Jagaddeva killed Arnoraja and occupied the Chahamana throne for a brief period, before Vigraharaja became the next king.

The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1989, for his contributions to biological sciences.  Biography  Banaras Hindu University Subhash Chandra Lakhotia, born on 4 October 1945 in Churu, a city near Thar desert in the Indian state of Rajasthan, to a Dwarka Prasad-Suryakala couple, did his early schooling in Churu and then in Kolkata. He graduated from Vidyasagar College, Calcutta University in Zoology Honours in 1964 before obtaining his master's degree in Zoology and Comparative Anatomy in 1966, both from Calcutta University. Continuing his doctoral studies at the same university at the Zoology Department, he secured his PhD in 1970, did his post-doctoral studies at Delhi University during 1970–71 and started his career as a lecturer at Burdwan University in 1971. Moving to Gujarat University in June 1972, he stayed there until September 1976 before joining Banaras Hindu University as a reader. He became a full professor in 1984 and continued there until superannuation in 2010. In between, he carried out some advanced studies at the Institute of Animal Genetics of the University of Edinburgh during 1972-73, at the University of California, Irvine during 1984-85 and at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge in 1985. After his formal superannuation, he continued his academic activities at the Banaras Hindu University as INSA senior scientist from January 2017 to January 2019. He is now working as life- long Distinguished Professor and SERB Distinguished Fellow.  Legacy  Drosophila melanogaster Lakhotia's researches are focused on cytogenetics, gene expression, cell and developmental biology. He carried out pioneering research on Drosophila (fruit flies) with regard to its chromosome organization and replication, and on the organization and functions of the long-non-coding RNA 93D or the hsromega gene locus of Drosophila melanogaster.https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/jbsc/036/03/0399-0423 During his doctoral studies on dosage compensation in Drosophila he further confirmed the hyperactive male-X model and elucidated its cellular autonomy. His discovery of active transcription in heterochromatin in Drosophila in early 1970s was one of the first documentations of transcriptional activity of heterochromatin. His later studies revealed the existence of two distinct replicon types in different cell types of Drosophila. He has been a pioneer researcher studying the long non-coding RNAs since 1980s and has contributed significantly to a wider appreciation of their function through sustained studies on the hsromega gene. His laboratory discovered the omega speckleshttp://jcs.biologists.org/content/113/19/3485 in Drosophila nuclei and established essential functions of the lncRNAs produced by the hsromega gene in organization of the intra-nuclear omega speckles. His studies also helped identify how this lncRNA gene modulates apoptosis and neurodegeneration in Drosophila models of human diseases. More recently, he established Drosophila as a good model to understand the mechanisms of actions of some of the ayurvedic formulations. His studies indicate that the Ayurvedic Amalaki Rasayana and Rasa-Sindoor can substantially suppress neurodegeneration associated with polyQ and Alzheimer's disorders. He has published more than 165 original research papers, review articles, and chapters in books, available at PubMed, an online repository of medical articles, and at ResearchGate. He has also written many articles relating policies about higher education, research publications, their assessment and ethics. He has mentored more than 30 scholars in their doctoral studies. Lakhotia contributed to the establishment of the Department of Molecular and Human Genetics at Banaras Hindu University and to the installation of the Confocal microscope facility at his department.

It is located on main Jhelum-Pind Dadan Khan road almost 60 km from Jhelum, 24 km from P.D.Khan and 48 km from Lilla interchange (M2). History During 1556-1605 AD, Raja Sadhawan Khan migrated from Ram Diana (now Midh Ranjha / Ranmal Sharif) area of Chenab River with his tribe (Jalap) and settled down on the banks of Jhelum River in the plain area of Salt Range.Sadhawan Khan had three grandsons - Allah Ditta Khan, Dhing Khan and Aadu Khan. Dhing Khan and Aadu Khan founded Dhingwal and Aaduwal respectively. Allah Ditta Khan had two sons - Panjan Khan and Panjayan Khan. Both brothers initially settled in the area of Kariala Jalap but lately Panjan Khan founded a new village on the east side called Panjanwal and today it is called Pinanwal. The graves of these gentlemen (few known and others unknown) are present in the ancient hill cemetery of Kariala Jalap. Panjan Khan had five sons who settled in Pinanwal and its environs. Murad Khan, the grandson of the eldest son Sher Khan, also had five sons who were Ali Muhammad Khan, Mali Khan, Shadi Khan, Azad Khan and Sultan Khan respectively. The Chak Shadi is attributed to Shadi Khan. Ali Muhammad Khan who remained in Pinanwal and Pir Bakhsh Khan was in the third generation. Pir Bakhsh Khan was a very God- fearing man.He dedicated mosques, five cemeteries and all the existing government roads in Pinanwal. Fateh Sher Khan, Ali Sher Khan, Tora Khan and Nawab Khan were his four sons, the last two have passed away. While the descendants of the other two still reside in Mohalla Kot and Pinanwal (Lok) respectively. Pir Bakhsh Khan was the soul owner of Pinanwal. Nawab Khan's son Sher Khan and grandsons Mughal Khan and Allah Dad Khan are buried in Motay Shah Cemetery, Mahle Khan's descendants Sarwar Khan, Ameer Khan and Nazir Khan are also buried there. Similarly, the graves of Sardar Khan, Wilayat Khan and Aslam Khan, descendants of Fateh Sher Khan, are also present in the same cemetery. The area in which the Jalap tribe resides is called \\"Jalap area\\". The boundaries of Jalap area are:- From Mouza Baghanwala including in the north to the Jhelum River in the south and from Mouza Chak Jani including in the east to Mouza Aadowal including in the west. This area is now counted in Jhelum district and has the most fertile land of the district. Residents of Jalap Area are very humble, sociable, simple-minded and hospitable, that is why even today the crime rate here is the lowest in the district. Pinanwal has a central position in the Jalap area. It is the center of economic, social and agricultural activities. The Jalap area has the most fertile land and that is why most of the people are engaged in agriculture. Crops All seasonal crops are grown here, But potatoes and maize have become cash crops. The largest agricultural commodity market in the district is located here. Once upon a time there was a small fort (kot) to which Mohalla Kot Ali is attributed. Pinanwal and Jalap Area’s population is made up of different communities, people have lived together for centuries in a relationship of mutual respect, brotherhood and expressed high values of society. Until the formation of Pakistan, 1947 Partition Pinanwal and Jalap area were also inhabited by Hindus, whose occupation was mostly trade. They all migrated to India on the occasion of Partition of India and were replaced by Muslims from East Punjab who endured the hardships of migration. It is important that the local people sent off them from the area without harming them. The government allotted Hindu property to the migrating Muslims and the locals, playing the role of Ansar e Madina, welcomed their brothers and left no stone unturned in their resettlement. They, due to their hard work, high morals and intelligence, soon mingled with the locals. They innovated agriculture and brought prosperity to Pinanawal and the Jalap area. The history of Jalap and Pinanwal spans more or less 425 years. This region is unique in Punjab in terms of its customs, society and values.

Primarily they were Crown or Ecclesiastical estate lands in England and the assessments were carried out by a team of surveyors during the period 1647 to 1650. The objective was to identify all landholders in each manor; determine how much land each held and how much rent they paid. The surveyors then made a valuation of what each holding was worth, so that the manor could be put up for sale. The money thus generated was to be used to pay Cromwell's Model Army. The Surveys were undertaken with a variety of accuracy. Those where the surveyors were able to copy from an existing register kept by the previous landlord are extremely accurate. However, where a register was not available the surveyors held manor court meetings at which all the manor tenants were supposed to appear to present their land holdings. Inevitably not all were keen to do so, and thus the survey results can be incomplete or inaccurate. Nevertheless, many of the surveys provide an invaluable complete tenant and land census of manors in the mid seventeenth century, where the landlord was the English Crown or the church. Original copies of the surveys are deposited in the Lambeth Palace Library in London. A few are in the National Archives in Kew, London; and some County Record Offices have copies of the Surveys in their region. Some have been transcribed and indexed. The lands surveyed were then sold to purchasers at a price related to the survey valuations, and on the basis of an assumption that the new owner would have a minimum of 10 years income from the property. This was fortunate as it happened that it was almost exactly 10 years between sale around 1650 and the restoration of the monarchy of Charles II in 1660. It was the reason why upon restoring ownership of the lands to the crown and church in 1661-2, very little compensation was ever paid to the 1650 purchasers. They were deemed to have enjoyed what they had paid for.

He worked at the National War College in Washington, D.C. creating maps of China and Japan. Davis was an illustrator for New York, Washington, D.C. and Denver newspapers. He was also commissioned to make paintings and murals. He moved to Denver in 1936, where his paintings captured notable people and landmarks of Denver and the west. \\"In some cases Davis provides the only extant image of certain people and places. In hundreds of colorful paintings and drawings he adds impressively to our portrait gallery,\\" according to James X. Kroll, Manager, Western History and Genealogy Department of the Denver Public Library, where many of Davis works are exhibited. His subjects ranged from notorious prostitutes, like Ella \\"Cattle Kate\\" Watson, to Governor Ralph Lawrence Carr. Davis made paintings of houses and mansions, like that owned by William Byers. He also captured the stately Tabor Grand Opera House and buildings that had significantly changed over time. Davis created a painting of an art gallery that used to be a brothel and another of a \\"shabby\\" apartment building that has been an elegant hotel. He painted The Face on the Barroom Floor, depicting his wife, on the bar room floor of Teller House in Central City. Early life Herndon Davis was in Wynnewood, Oklahoma born in 1901. His parents were ranchers. The family moved often. Davis moved to Kansas City, Missouri when he was fourteen to take art lessons, which he supported by taking unskilled jobs. He then moved to Chicago and worked as an apprentice to an engraver and as a commercial artist. Career =Early career= He joined the army and was stationed in Denver in 1920 before being transferred to work on maps of China and Japan at the War College in Washington D.C. Davis attended Yale briefly. He then moved to New York where he attended the National Academy of Design and Art Students League of New York. Davis lived in Greenwich Village. He was employed by the New York Herald Tribune, Washington Times-Herald and Washington Daily News. =Denver journalist and muralist= The Face on the Barroom Floor Davis worked for The Denver Post and the Rocky Mountain News, beginning in 1936. He was also commissioned to paint murals, such as a scene of Denver newspaper staff painted in the Denver Press Club card room and a mural in the tearoom of the Denver Dry Goods store. He painted a mural for the La Caverna Hotel in Eddy County, New Mexico. =The Face= Davis was commissioned by the Central City Opera Association to paint a series of paintings for the Central City Opera House; he was also requested to do some work at the Teller House in Central City. While staying at Teller House, and on a whim, he painted The Face on the Barroom Floor. The mural painted on the floor of the hotel's bar, now named The Face, was confirmed to be his wife after her death. It is thought to have been inspired by the poem The Face upon the Barroom Floor by Hugh Antoine d'Arcy. That episode led to the artist and journalist being called “that drunk who painted the face on the barroom floor”, according to authors Tom Noel and Craig Leavitt. =Notable people and places= Some of his paintings of notable people and places, like the painting of Dr. Frederick J. Bancroft's farmhouse made in 1941, are displayed at the Western History section of the Denver Public Library. The book Herndon Davis: Painting Colorado History, 1901–1962 was released in conjunction of an exhibition of his work at the Denver Public Library. There was also an exhibit, in conjunction with the book, in 2016 at the Denver Art Museum. Among the notable subjects of his portraits were Governor Ralph Lawrence Carr, actress Katharine Hepburn, Mother Cabrini, and Emily Griffith. Davis painted a portrait of Josiah Gregg (1806-1850) between 1950 and 1962, which is in the collection of Palace of the Governors, a New Mexico History Museum. He also painted santos. Davis created a wash drawing of the notorious House of Mirrors brothel, that later became a Buddhist temple. It was used as an illustration in Caroline Bancroft's Six Racy Madams of Colorado. His illustration of Ella \\"Cattle Kate\\" Watson was used for Red Light Women of the Rocky Mountain by Jan MacKell. Davis captured images of Denver's landmarks, generally in watercolor, some of which no longer exist. The captured what Thomas Noel said many thought to be \\"the finest building ever done in Denver,\\" the Tabor Grand Opera House, in its glory. He also captured realistic images of landmarks as they had transitioned over the years. Now a gallery of western art, the Navarre building across from the Brown Palace Hotel had been a brothel. Once considered the \\"Delmonico of the West\\" the Charpiot's Hotel had become a \\"shabby apartment building with seedy storefronts with old cars lined up in front of it.\\" He captured the \\"tattered\\" nature of what had once been the \\"elegant\\" Arcade Saloon, a gambling hall located on Larimer. Other places that Davis captured were the Palace Variety Theatre and Grayson's store and other 16th buildings in Eugene Field Alley. The Rocky Mountain News published an article, with commentary provided by Joe Emerson Smith, in the 1940s about his paintings of landmarks. He captured homes, too, like the mansions of William Byers and Ed Chase. Personal life and death Davis met Edna Juanita (Nita) Cotter in 1928. Cotter, who was eleven years older than Davis, was to become his wife. Herndon was commissioned to create a mural for the Smithsonian Institution, which he began work on, when he died of a heart attack in 1962. He is buried in Fort Logan National Cemetery.

From 1971 to 1976, he served his curacy at St Mary's Church, Risca in the Diocese of Monmouth. On 18 May 1973, he was commissioned into the Royal Army Chaplains' Department (RAChD), Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve, as a Chaplain to the Forces 4th Class (equivalent in rank to captain); this meant that he served as a part-time military chaplain in addition to his parish ministry.

On 30 January 1981, he transferred to a regular commission. He was promoted to Chaplain to the Forces 3rd Class (equivalent in rank to major) on 30 January 1982, and to Chaplain to the Forces 2nd Class on 1 January 1990 (equivalent in rank to lieutenant colonel). On 10 May 1999, Blackburn was appointed Deputy Chaplain General and promoted to brigadier. As the most senior Anglican chaplain in the RAChD, he was appointed the Archdeacon for the Army in 1999. On 13 May 2000, he was appointed Chaplain General and promoted to major general. He retired from the British Army on 30 July 2004. After leaving the military, Blackburn returned to the Diocese of Monmouth. From 2004 to 2013, he was Vicar of St Mary's Church, Risca; this was the same parish where he had served his curacy three decades earlier. He retired from full-time ministry on 15 July 2013. Since 2014, he has held permission to officiate in the Diocese of Swansea and Brecon. Personal life In 1970, Blackburn married Anne Elisabeth Woodcock. Together they have two daughters.
