Prior to 2020 the team was known as Israel Cycling Academy. History In November 2014, the pair launched the Israel Cycling Academy (ICA), with the aim of providing an opportunity for young and talented cyclists to compete in the international arena and launch their professional careers. This team was intended to provide inspiration, hope and faith to future generations of Israelis. The team's first ever victory came in the fourth stage of the 2015 Tour d'Azerba√Ødjan, which was won by Daniel Turek. On 2 July 2015, the Israeli Road Racing Champion Guy Sagiv joined the ranks of ICA. In 2018, the team participated in a cycling monument event for the first time ‚Äì 2018 Milan-San Remo, and in a grand tour for the first time ‚Äì the 2018 Giro d'Italia. The Giro d‚ÄôItalia opening stage took place in Jerusalem on May 4, 2018 ‚Äì the first time in the Giro‚Äòs 101 years of existence that it has started outside Europe. The Giro held its second and third stages in Israel before it continued onto European soil. The three stages raced in Israel attracted considerable interest from the Israeli public, with many thousands of Israelis lining up along the route and supporting the riders and especially the ICA home team. It was considered a significant success. ICA co-owner Sylvan Adams was the driving force behind the Giro‚Äôs ‚ÄúBig Start‚Äù in Israel, having financed a significant part of the race budget. ICA's best performance in the Giro was recorded in the 18th stage, when its Spanish rider Ruben Plaza finished in second place. Three days later when the team completed the Giro in Rome, Guy Sagiv became the first- ever Israeli cyclist to finish a grand tour. In 2019, in its fifth season of existence, ICA enlarged its team roster to 30 riders and set up a racing program that has exceeded 250 racing days all around the globe. The team was invited to take part in the Giro d‚ÄôItalia In May 2019 and will make its first appearance in the Tour of California. The team owners, Ron Baron and Sylvan Adams, have set the team's goal as participation in the world‚Äôs biggest races including the Tour de France, in order to continue inspiring and developing a new generation of Israeli cyclists. In January 2019 the team opened three cycling special youth programs in Israel and formed a youth cycling team in the Arab village of Shfaram. To further develop young Israeli cyclists, ICA operates a development team with a select group of under-23 riders. They have also established a special partnership with one of the leading French amateur teams ‚Äì C√¥te d‚ÄôArmor ‚Äì which enables its young development team riders to race in France and gain valuable experience overseas. In October 2019, ICA completed the takeover of UCI World Tour team Katusha-Alpecin, including its UCI WorldTour license. As a result, ICA was due to become a UCI World Tour team, pending UCI approval.. The UCI approved the team's promotion to World Tour status in December of that year, and the team subsequently changed its name to Israel Start Up Nation, while the former name became the name of the team's continental level development squad. In July 2020 it was announced that 7 time Grand Tour winner Chris Froome would join the team for the 2021 season.

Parenting as an adaptive problem in mammals involves specific endocrine signals that were naturally selected to respond to infant cues and environmental inputs. Infants across species produce a number of cues to inform caregivers of their needs. These include visual cues, like facial characteristics, or in some species smiling, auditory cues, such as vocalizations, olfactory cues, and tactile stimulation. A commonly mentioned hormone in parenting is oxytocin, however many other hormones relay key information that results in variations in behavior. These include estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, cortisol, and testosterone. While hormones are not necessary for the expression of maternal behavior, they may influence it. Based on cross species evidence, some aspects of these mechanisms have been phylogenetically conserved from rodents to humans, meaning that these mechanisms are adaptive for mammalian parenting and that the environment of evolutionary adaptedness of some parenting mechanisms may have evolved when mammals first evolved. The importance of these mechanisms are to regulate parental investment and to inform offspring about their environment, primarily those involving responsiveness and sensitivity. These are commonly mentioned in humans as important parenting characteristics that inform their infants about their environments.  Estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, and oxytocin  Nonhuman females = Many nonhuman studies can be used as both potential models for humans and to show the phylogenetic conservation of some endocrine signals. Estrogen and progesterone released by ovaries during pregnancy make oxytocin receptors more sensitive in female rats and is associated with the onset of maternal behaviors in other species as well. Maestripieri found a very similar relationship in which estrogen and progesterone are increased during pregnancy whereas oxytocin was increased postpartum. The presence of estrogen, progesterone, and estradiol in pregnant mammals in some species appears to exhibit a correlation to maternal behavior in the mammals before and after the birth of their offspring as well as in interactions with other offspring However, an increase in hormones influences maternal behavior, but it is not always the cause of the onset of maternal behavior in females. Some studies on primates in which increased estrogen and progesterone have a negative or absent correlation with maternal responsivity are in black tufted-ear marmosets, common marmosets, lowland gorillas, and baboons. Alternatively, one experimental study showed that nulliparous rats, which tend to avoid pups, were transfused with postpartum rat blood that is high in estrogen and progesterone which resulted in responsiveness to the pups‚Äô cues. Due to this variation between species, the effects of the hormones listed does not give much weight to the phylogenetic conservation of these neuroendocrine mechanisms; although Saltzman points out that the social structure of some species may be significant. In social species, previous exposure to infants relies less on these hormones to activate mechanisms and more on modulating maternal behavior, because parenting behaviors are not always dependent on hormones. On the other hand, in non-human primates, specifically lactating females of multiple species, there is an alarming correlation with increased estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin. These species include black tufted-ear marmosets, baboons, rhesus macaques, and gorillas. Endogenous signals such as an increase in estrogen compared to a decrease in progesterone, causes an increase in the levels of prolactin, the ‚Äúlactating hormone,‚Äù in the bloodstream. Furthermore, exogenous cues from infants such as suckling induces this mechanism. The hormone oxytocin, similarly to prolactin, has been found to increase with an increase in estrogen and the presence of infant cues such as suckling. Oxytocin has been found in other non-human species to inhibit the rejection of offspring; oxytocin is essential for responsive and sensitive caregiving. Some specific examples include Francis's study on female rats which linked high amount of oxytocin receptors to increased grooming, and another study by Maestripieri which linked oxytocin levels in free-ranging macaques to increased nursing and grooming. However, experimental results are less conclusive. As aforementioned, nulliparous mice do not respond to pup calls, but when administered with oxytocin, they do. A similar study conducted by Holmon and Goy tested nulliparous rhesus females, where their behavior post injection did not elicit a drastic response to infants, however, the adults presented a change in their behavior with a notable increase in proximity and touching. Oxytocin is more often described as a hormone that facilitates bonding and not one that directly increases care. Also, the mice were responding to pup calls and the rhesus macaque infants weren't necessarily providing cues that would induce maternal care and support. Saltzman proposes that this is due to primates living socially and having a slower developmental trajectory, in which learning is more important. The function of oxytocin may lead to an increase in maternal behavior by subsequently reducing anxiety as it has been found to regulate anxiety, social recognition, and coping with stress. Early studies have found that oxytocin influenced maternal behavior of mother rats depending on the environment in which they were placed. Oxytocin seemed to have an opposing effect on anxiety so that when placed in a novel environment as opposed to a familiar one, mother rats were better able to cope with their higher levels of stress due to their increased oxytocin levels. = Human females = Like in many nonhuman animals, human mothers go through a period of high progesterone during pregnancy that is followed by a decrease in progesterone and a subsequent increase in estrogen, prolactin and oxytocin near parturition. During pregnancy and postpartum, a high estradiol to progesterone ratio is associated with mothers reporting higher feelings of attachment. High levels of progesterone, which are associated with pregnancy, inhibits prolactin and therefore lactation. Prolactin increases during the initial stages of lactation and can be stimulated by estrogen but not progesterone. Research, however, focuses on the role of prolactin for breastfeeding and less on other behaviors. Prolactin increases with infant suckling, but not other forms of infant contact. Oxytocin on the other hand increases with both suckling, and physical contact in human females. Oxytocin levels in human females are associated with the degree of physical affection and bonding. Feldman (2010) found that mothers who displayed ‚Äúhigh affectionate contact‚Äù had increased oxytocin levels post interaction, but not mothers who displayed ‚Äúlow affectionate contact.‚Äù Oxytocin is believed to provide a feedback loop, meaning that maternal-infant contact increases oxytocin and oxytocin increases maternal behavior and facilitates bonding. In one study oxytocin also played a role on mother reported attachment to her fetus. Studies have shown that plasma oxytocin in pregnant women is higher compared to non-pregnant women. = Nonhuman males = Wynne-Edwards and Timonin recognize that paternal care is not primed in the same way as maternal care simply because males do not undergo pregnancy. Therefore, males do not go through the same hormonal changes as women. The simplest way, through natural selection, for paternal care to evolve or be maintained is to use the same or similar pathways as females. Wynne and Reburn (2001) suggest that fathers who are pair bonded and spend time with the soon to be mother may activate paternal pathways through various cues. Estradiol increases just before their offspring's birth in black-tufted-ear marmosets and dwarf hamsters and possibly activates certain pathways involved in paternal behavior. This is similar to estrogen and progesterone in pregnant females. However, the manipulation of estradiol does not increase or decrease paternal behaviors. This may be similar to the finding that women who do not breastfeed or do not have vaginal births still responds to their infants. Like expecting and new mothers, fathers in multiple mammals have elevated prolactin levels compared to non-fathers. These species include California mice, Mongolian gerbils, dwarf hamsters, meerkats, marmosets, and cotton-top tamarins. However, the previously listed studies have different cues and are associated with different paternal behaviors, and this may be due to species specific mechanisms or simply different contexts. The above species are biparental and the elevated prolactin levels in males were not exclusive to fathers. There are variable results in between the effects of oxytocin on paternal care between males of different species. Oxytocin levels are unchanged in California mice before and after becoming fathers, but the amount of paternal exposure to rats is associated with an increase in oxytocin and increased care. However, multiple studies on biparental species show an association between paternal care and oxytocin. Since the species in these studies are biparental, excluding rats, it is unclear as to why California mice do not have a change in oxytocin postpartum. = Human males = In human mothers, oxytocin is associated with high physical contact and affection. However, studies on fathers show that oxytocin is related to high stimulatory contact and exploratory play. This supports three hypotheses: # Mothers and fathers play different roles. # Mothers and fathers have similar pathways. # That there are parallels to animal models, assuming that a high amount of OT receptors in nonhuman animals is associated with a high amount of oxytocin One study exhibited the proposed effects that oxytocin had on Tsimane men who had been hunting for varying periods of time. Once the men returned home, it was found that oxytocin levels were higher in those men who had hunted for longer periods of time. As a result of the longer time period spent hunting, the increased levels of oxytocin were thought to be interconnected with familial social contact dating back to humans‚Äô evolutionary past. = Comparison of estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, and oxytocin between species and sex = Across multiple species and in some cases across sexes, there is evidence for the phylogenetic conservation of parental hormones. These include the relationships between the hormones estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, and oxytocin. In males across species, including humans, increased prolactin levels are associated with fatherhood. In both non-human primates and humans, the increase in estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy is often followed by a decrease in progesterone and an increase in prolactin, postpartum. One study utilized Silastic implants containing estradiol and progesterone which were implanted in nulliparous rats that either maintained the function of their pituitary glands or underwent a hypophysectomy to determine the length of time for maternal care to ensue. The rats with hypophysectomies exposed to these conditions for 5-6 days were not affected by the treatment and consequently did not induce any maternal behavior. However, it was found that those rats with functioning pituitary glands exhibited maternal behavior within about 3-4 days. In some studies on females across species, estrogen and progesterone prepartum is also related to oxytocin. Although, the relationships between these hormones is similar across species, there is variation in the degree to how oxytocin effects behavior. For example, in some species, like rats, an increase in oxytocin greatly increases interactions with infants, but an increase in oxytocin in macaques only mildly increased interactions. However, the importance here is that oxytocin increased interactions in all of the relevant cited studies for females, as well as the majority of studies cited for males. In fathers across species the effects of oxytocin are more variable, however in general oxytocin is associated with increased paternal care. In human fathers increased oxytocin is linked to increased involvement, however the type of involvement is different between fathers and mothers, where fathers focus more on stimulatory contact and exploratory play. In human mothers oxytocin is associated with general care and affection. One study examined the effects that intranasal oxytocin spray administration has in relation to individuals' childhood experiences of punishment by maternal love withdrawal. It was found that oxytocin effects were absent in individuals who experienced high maternal love withdrawal indicating that the parental behavior associated with withdrawal causes alterations in the genetic expression of endogenous oxytocin levels which affects their children into adulthood.  Cortisol and prolactin  Nonhuman females = Contrary to the positive effects of oxytocin on maternal behavior, heightened levels of cortisol postpartum has been linked to a decrease in maternal care in nonhuman species, including the western lowland gorilla, baboons, Japanese macaques, and rhesus macaques. However, there has been some evidence to support that the increase in cortisol levels during pregnancy results in an increased maternal care in two baboon species. This variation possibly shows an ontogenetic difference in the role of cortisol. The functions of prolactin have been extensively studied on rats which has revealed its effects and profound role in maternal care. The role of prolactin has been found to induce the maternal behavior in nulliparous rats exposed to a hypophysectomized steroid treatment as noted in which prolactin secreting pituitary implants were placed under the kidney capsule which caused a shortened latency to participate in maternal behavior towards foster pups. The functions of prolactin have been extensively studied on rats which has revealed its effects and profound role in maternal care. The role of prolactin has been found to induce the maternal behavior in nulliparous rats exposed to a hypophysectomized steroid treatment as noted in which prolactin secreting pituitary implants were placed under the kidney capsule which caused a shortened latency to participate in maternal behavior towards foster pups. A different study used non-hypophysectomized, steroid-treated nulliparous rats were exposed to a dopamine D2 agonist, called bromocriptine, used to decrease the release of prolactin. Bromocriptine, in turn, consequently lowered the maternal behavioral tendency to foster the young pups. Conversely, when bromocriptine was used in conjunction with prolactin, the maternal behavior returned. Another experiment also utilized bromocriptine to inhibit the release of prolactin in mother rats who were lactating to their pups during a 2-5-day period. The inhibition of prolactin release appears to indicate a critical period of the development of prolactin mechanisms within the pups. One study demonstrated that a deficiency in prolactin during the postnatal period in rats has the potential to affect their maternal behavior. In this study bromocriptine-treated juvenile rats exhibited hyperactivity and distractibility from the pups during the maternal behavior test suggesting the importance of prolactin to promote maternal behavior. Adult rats also treated with bromocriptine showed similar differences when exposed to pups as opposed to control rats that exhibited maternal tendencies towards the pups. It was determined that prolactin deficiency may lead to disruptions in maternal behavior in adulthood, affect the neural substrates that promote maternal behavior, and that behavioral deficits are not only caused by a developmental delay in the systems regulating maternal behavior. = Human females = Cortisol in human mothers is elevated during pregnancy. Human mothers with elevated cortisol during pregnancy more easily recognized, and were more attracted to, their own infant's odors postpartum, but this did not affect maternal attitudes toward their infants. Behaviorally, mothers with higher levels of cortisol postpartum displayed higher levels of affectionate approach. Women with higher cortisol levels were also more alert and sympathetic to infant crying. Fleming and colleagues discovered that there was variation in how cortisol affected mothers with only one offspring and those with more than one offspring. When cortisol levels were high, women with one offspring displayed more affectionate contact, and women with multiple offspring spent more time in caretaking activities. However, the authors did not report whether or not the two groups of women had significantly different levels of cortisol. If they were different, the specific levels of cortisol may be a contributing factor in the different behaviors. = Human males = Couvade syndrome, or sympathy pregnancy, is defined by Masoni and colleagues as fathers having two or more pregnancy symptoms. Human fathers with couvade syndrome have higher levels of prolactin, and cortisol levels than fathers without. Cross-culturally couvade syndrome is associated with how close the mother and father are just prior to birth; in the postpartum period, these fathers invested more in direct care. Increased paternal care is likely associated with offspring survival. A study on Canadian fathers found that, just before the birth of their infant, the fathers had significantly higher prolactin and cortisol levels. The father's prolactin and cortisol levels correlated with the mothers, although her levels were significantly higher. This provides evidence for Wynne and Reburn's hypothesis that mothers may provide cues to the father to activate paternal care pathways. In a separate study, fathers with higher prolactin compared to other fathers responded more positively to infant crying. These levels also positively correlated with father experience. In the same study, cortisol levels in response to infant cries were negatively correlated with father experience. Higher cortisol levels was associated with higher father alertness and responsiveness to infant crying. Increased levels of cortisol in response to infant cries was greater in inexperienced fathers. = Comparison of cortisol and prolactin between species and sex = The behaviors associated with elevated cortisol levels appears to be more related to whether or not the mother was pre or postpartum, however the behaviors varied across species. In multiple studies on nonhuman females across species, found that high levels of cortisol postpartum was linked to low levels of maternal care. However, when cortisol levels were high during pregnancy there was an increase in maternal care. This difference did not hold true for humans of females and first time fathers. Increased cortisol levels in general increased maternal care. Increased cortisol levels in first time human fathers correlated with an increase in responsiveness to their infant's crying, but not in fathers with more than one offspring.  Testosterone  Human females = Studies have been conducted that show an interaction between brain circuits that respond to baby-stimuli, such as infant cries, and testosterone and oxytocin pathways. It has been found that when acute amounts of testosterone and oxytocin are administered to nulliparous women exposed to infant cries, they cause decreased responses in the amygdala and increased insula and inferior frontal gyrus responses. The alterations in responses within those brain regions have been seen to induce maternal behaviors. As such, there is speculation that increasing the availability of testosterone and oxytocin alters the maternal brain to induce a non-aversive response to infant cries. = Nonhuman males = The most commonly associated hormone with males is testosterone. It is believed to be the ‚Äúanti-parental hormone‚Äù; it inhibits the activation of paternal mechanisms. In many cases testosterone levels decrease when fathers have or actively care for their infants in non-humans. However, testosterone can be converted into estradiol, which supports paternal behavior. Testosterone is converted into estradiol through the process of aromatization. Stated previously, with the repeated presence of pups to non-parental rats, caregiving mechanisms can inhibit other mechanism, like the avoidance mechanism; similar inhibitions occur in male marmosets. When male marmosets hold their infants, they did not have an increased testosterone response to novel females when they otherwise would. In other words, holding the infant inhibited the mating mechanisms. This could mean that caregiving supersedes mating in some situations. For example, it may be adaptive to continue to invest in your current offspring rather than potentially create another. = Human males = Multiple studies on fathers have shown that a reduction in testosterone results in increased responsiveness to infant cues and that fathers in general have lower testosterone than non-fathers. Testosterone in human males decreases with the number of offspring human males have. However, human males with higher level testosterone had greater activation of neural mechanisms when interacting with their own infants, this may be due to the activation of a paternal protection mechanism. = Comparison of testosterone between species and sexes = Between species variation in behaviors associated with testosterone in biparental species was not noted. Across species father experience was negatively correlated with testosterone and lower levels of testosterone was associate with an increase in care. Testosterone is more commonly studied in males than females. However, one study on human females found that lower testosterone is associated with increased maternal care.

He was disowned by his father for his brutal treatment of his wife and tenants. Early life and education FitzRoy was born on 24 August 1715, the eldest surviving son of Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton and Henrietta Somerset, daughter of Charles Somerset, Marquess of Worcester. His father was Lord Chamberlain to George I and George II. His brother was Lord Augustus FitzRoy and Caroline Stanhope, Countess of Harrington. He attended Eton College in 1728. Marriage FitzRoy married Lady Dorothy Boyle, the daughter of Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington and 4th Earl of Cork and Dorothy Savile, Countess of Burlington and Countess of Cork, in October 1741. In the biography written in the History of the Parliament, Lady Boyle was described as \\"a girl of the softest temper, vast beauty, birth, and fortune.\\" After she died on 2 May 1742, her mother said that Dorothy was relieved of the \\"extremest misery\\", that Lady Boyle's husband exacted on her as what is described as \\"utmost brutality\\". Parliament FitzRoy stood for Coventry at a by-election on 15 February 1737 which was declared void. He was then returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Coventry at a by-election on 12 April 1737. He voted in 1740 for the place bill, siding with the Administration, but his activity was otherwise spotty. He was put up for election in 1747 for Coventry, but died before the election. Brutality FitzRoy's father, Charles FitzRoy, was particularly dissatisfied with his brutal behavior. For instance, one of George's tenants, a father of six children, killed himself after he had been pressed to pay more than his rent. The tenant stated that he had already paid the full rent owed, but would be willing to pay extra if that was what was needed, to which George responded by threatening to have the man's family removed from his residence. George had duped his father multiple times, in which he declared that he was sorry for his behavior and vowed to change. His words finally met deaf ears when his father disowned him in August 1743. In autumn 1744 FitzRoy eloped to Italy with a Miss Nevill, a celebrated beauty with a fortune to her name, and promised her marriage which never materialised. Death FitzRoy died without issue on 7 July 1747.

This approach investigates how ageing is imagined (in mostly Western societies), how ageism operates, and how elders respond to exclusion.Gullette, M. (2004). Aged by culture. Chicago IL: University of Chicago Press.Sawchuk, K. (2013). ‚ÄúTactical Mediatization and Activist Ageing: pressures, pushbacks and the story of RECAA,‚Äù in MediKulture special issue on mediatization edited by Stig Hjarvard and Line Nybro Peterson. RECAA Flashmob Montreal Many elders, and especially women, are involved in organizations that aim to effect social change on issues related to ageing or in general.Charpentier, Mich√®le, Anne Qu√©niart et Julie Jacques (2008). Femmes, militance et vieillissement. Amnis 8 : http://amnis.revues.org/583 ; DOI : 10.4000/amnis.583 Retirement engenders a form of social exclusion. In this context becoming an activist or a volunteer represents one's agency and participation in social change, outside the market system. Instead of assuming a passive role, they act. As elder rights activists and members of community organizations, they try to prevent elder abuse, raise awareness, build resources and networks.Sawchuk, K. (2013). ‚ÄúTactical Mediatization and Activist Ageing: pressures, pushbacks and the story of RECAA,‚Äù in MediKulture special issue on mediatization edited by Stig Hjarvard and Line Nybro Peterson. Activist ageing is different from active ageing.  Organizations  * Respecting Elders: Communities Against Abuse (RECAA): Aims to raise awareness of elder mistreatment within the ethnocultural communities, using strategies such as forum theatre (acting out situations from the life of elders to stimulate discussion). They participate to events like the World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. * Raging Grannies: Created in 1987 in British Columbia, they spread across countries. They are social justice activists. * CARP (Canada): An organization that defends the needs of older Canadians and offer benefits to its members. * Seniors Action Quebec: Aims to address the living conditions of English-Speaking seniors in Quebec and give access to information for an active and healthy aging to its members.  Ageivism - The Ideology of Activist Ageing  For many years the action around rights of older persons and social activism of older adults was not anchored in a unique ideological framework. It is only in recent years that attempts to frame the global elder rights movement within an ideology began to build up. One such an attempt is the development of Ageivism as an ideology of aging. Ageivism is defined as follows: \\"Ageivism\\" refers to an ideology which serves as the basis for calls for social action (echoing similar \\"isms\\", e.g. feminism, or socialism) on the protection and promotion of the rights of older persons based on the grounds of political, social and economic principles of identity, dignity and social justice.Doron, I. (2018). Re-thinking old age: Time for Ageivism. The Human Rights Defender, 27(1), 33-36.  Mediatization  Canadian governmental services offered through various Internet portals require greater technological skills from the part of elders, who need to comply in order to get information about their rights or specific programs.Middleton, C. & Sorensen, C. (2005). How connected Are Canadians ? Inequities in Canadian households‚Äô Internet access. Canadian Journal of Communication, 30(4): 463-483. The development of digital technologies forces activists and community organizations to consider including media in their actions. Many organizations use digital technologies to contact other organizations at a distance, to document their organization's history and actions, and to develop intergenerational ties. Contrary to popular discourses that represent the elderly as passive and dependent, their uses of digital media show their agency and ability to produce media content.Sawchuk, K. (2013). ‚ÄúTactical Mediatization and Activist Ageing: pressures, pushbacks and the story of RECAA,‚Äù in MediKulture special issue on mediatization edited by Stig Hjarvard and Line Nybro Peterson.

Early life and education Gangloff was born in Amityville, New York. She received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in 1997.  Early career  In high school, Gangloff began creating large-scale paintings in the attic of an old barn owned by her parents in Amityville, New York. While studying for her B.F.A. at Cooper Union, the artist continued to paint murals and large-scale works. Working large allowed the artist to feel that she was embedded \\"in [a] color-field with the paint,\\" an experience that was \\"an immediate way to abstract your space.\\" Gangloff painted large portraits, using house paint on butcher paper, of her peers and members of her local artistic community while she was a student. In an interview with BOMB Magazine, Gangloff states that the images were \\"always of my friends or people I was hanging out with or liked at school or wanted to tease or get some kind of reaction out of. It was a way to communicate. It‚Äôs my sense of humor too: I do whatever I want visually and then just pretend that I don‚Äôt know what the big stink is. . .\\" After graduating from Cooper Union in 1997, Gangloff worked as a dish washer in a German restaurant in New Jersey for three months before moving to Bozeman, Montana to live with her older brother. She worked at a bronze foundry in Bozeman for a short period of time before she moved back to New York City and began work as a metal chaser at New Foundry in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Following her job at New Foundry, she was employed to draw scenes from movies for Built by Wendy, a clothing and accessory line. Later career and work In her professional career, Hope Gangloff continues to exclusively draw and paint her peers and everyday objects in settings of relative intimacy. Her subjects are often depicted in domestic spaces and in poses of relaxation or quiet focus. Her drawings and paintings are noted for their vibrancy, with the artist describing her compositions as vehicles for color theory. Gangloff discussed her fascination with painting portraits in a 2018 interview with Artspace, stating, \\"I'm a big fan of portraiture‚Äîhumans are endlessly entertaining and interesting. I like painting people I know because the familiarity helps relax both the subject and myself. Anyone who has sat for me knows that the first four hours painting will probably be erased completely. It's less stressful when my model already knows that.\\" She has further likened her creative process to rock climbing: > An outsider who doesn‚Äôt look at a lot of art might not understand why I > paint similar things over and over again‚Ä¶ But there are always micro > movements. I‚Äôm always working through problems. Rock climbers look for > little changes in rocks to help them climb and keep going. When I look at a > painting, I‚Äôm also looking for the move that‚Äôs going to set off something > else. The whole painting is like a problem I‚Äôm trying to solve. For the Miami New Times, Neil Vazquez has written that \\"Gangloff pushes the boundaries of abstraction and figuration\\" in which the colorful and abstract backgrounds are \\"juxtaposed against banal subjects.\\" Combined with subject matter and color, Laura Staugaitis states that \\"[t]he artist‚Äôs strong but gestural lines create defined shapes that are filled with repetitive marks and bright patterns. Gangloff gives equal textural attention to all areas of the painting, which draws the viewer‚Äôs eye to every detail and also contextualizes each portrait sitter in a unique set of surroundings.\\" Gangloff has exhibited internationally with solo museum exhibitions at the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts at Stanford University; Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum; and the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum at Michigan State University. Her work has additionally been featured in group exhibitions at the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art; the Institute of Contemporary Art at Maine College of Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and the Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts. Work can be found in the collections of the Alturas Foundation, San Antonio, Texas; the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum at Michigan Stage University; the Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts; the Cleveland Clinic; Grinnell College; the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art; the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts; and, Stanford University Medical Center at Stanford University. In 2017, Gangloff was the inaugural artist for the Cantor Art Center‚Äôs Diekman Contemporary Commissions program, which resulted in a solo show and a weeklong residency. As a part of her residency, she painted live in the museum's atrium over the course of three days. That same year, she was selected as the cover artist for the 2017 Winter/Spring Program at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) as part of the academy's tradition of featuring visual art on the cover of BAMbill.

Vargas headed the Subcentral TIPNIS, the indigenous authority which holds title to the Isiboro S√©cure National Park and Indigenous Territory (TIPNIS), from 15 August 2011 to 30 November 2016. Vargas is a member of the Moxe√±o Trinitario indigenous people and was born in the village of Para√≠so, located on the S√©cure River in what was then the Isiboro S√©cure National Park. In 1990, the murder of his nephew Roy Jou Vargas at six years of age in a conflict occasioned by a non-indigenous landowner, propelled him into public activism. Vargas became leader of Para√≠so, a technical member of the Subcentral, and in 2011, its president. During Vargas' term as leader, the TIPNIS indigenous community was engaged in an extended campaign against the building of the Villa Tunari‚ÄìSan Ignacio de Moxos Highway through the territory, a project championed by President Evo Morales. Vargas was one of the leaders of 2011 and 2012 marches by the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia (CIDOB) against the project. The 2011 march won the passage of a law to protect the territory by declaring it an \\"intangible zone.\\" However, in 2012 the Bolivian government carried out a disputed consultation process, and concluded that intangibility should be lifted and the roadway proceed. In 2013, Vargas brought a complaint against the government before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Vargas was a candidate for the Green Party in the 2014 presidential election, with the party's leader and founder Margot Soria Saravia serving as vice presidential candidate. With 24,685 out of 27,403 polling stations having reported in the Green Party had gained 126,958 votes in the presidential elections, a total of 2.79%. In June 2020, Minister of Rural Development and Lands Beatriz Capobianco designated Vargas the General Exeuctive Director of the Indigenous Development Fund, where he succeeded Rafael Quispe; he assumed the office in early July.

He appears to have taken his first art lessons from Nikolaos Doxaras, who lived on Zakynthos during the 1750s. At the age of sixteen, under his direction, Koutouzis painted decorations at the Churches of Saint John of Damascus and Saint Demetrius, both of which have since been destroyed. He may have lived in Venice from 1760 to 1764. If so, he was definitely back at Zakynthos in 1766, painting the \\"Procession of Saint Dionysius\\". He also wrote satirical poems on local affairs and scandals, which often contained sharp lampoons of his contemporaries. In 1770, this led to an assault, during which he was wounded in the face. To hide the scar, he grew a beard. This event is also cited as his reason for becoming a priest, but it was seven years later before he took up priestly duties on Lefkada. He subsequently became a parish priest at several locations on his native island. Nevertheless, he continued to write satirical poetry. This, combined with what was considered a theatrical manner of conducting church services, led to clashes with his superiors and parishioners. Eventually, he was charged with \\"\\"misconduct and violation of the Orthodox ritual\\" and was defrocked in 1810. Three years later, some of his accusers recanted and he was reinstated, but refused to take up his duties. He died a few months later. Although he focused on religious painting, his portraits are, perhaps, his best known work. He also took in the occasional student, most notably Nikolaos Kantounis.Brief biography @ the National Gallery website ReferencesFurther reading *Nikolaos Koutouzis, ŒíœâŒºŒøŒªŒøœáŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ œÉŒ¨œÑŒπœÅŒµœÇ ŒπŒµœÅŒ≠œâŒΩ, (satirical poems) Periplus, 1996 * Dinos Konomos, Nikolaos Koutouzis (a biographical novel), Athens, A.Karavias, 1974  External links  *Biographical notes, with samples of his poetry, @ the Imera (Zante edition) website Category:1741 births Category:1813 deaths Category:Greek portrait painters Category:Religious artists Category:People from Zakynthos Category:Greek satirists Category:18th-century Greek painters Category:19th-century Greek painters ","title":"Nikolaos Koutouzis"},{"id":"45647152","text":"Alexandre Castellino (born 6 January 1881, date of death unknown) was a Swiss racing cyclist.

He is credited with being one of the first to bring the need for widespread school reform to the public eye, and with laying the foundation for future empirical educational research.Graham, Patricia A. (1966). Joseph Mayer Rice as a Founder of the Progressive Education Movement. Journal of Educational Measurement, 3(2), 129‚Äì133. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/1433887. Early life Rice was born in Philadelphia to Bavarian immigrant parents. His father, a private tutor, was Mayer Rice; his mother was Fanny Sohn. Rice attended Philadelphia schools until the age of 13, when his family moved to New York City.Kridel, C. (2000). \\"Rice, Joseph Mayer.\\" In American National Biography Online. Oxford University Press. Retrieved from http://www.anb.org/articles/09/09-01039.html. In New York, Rice graduated from high school and enrolled in the City College of New York. He received his medical degree from the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University in 1881 and established a pediatric practice in 1884. His pediatric research into the New York City public school fitness programs sparked a lifelong investment in education and children's welfare. Travels in Germany (1888-1890) Rice left his medical practice in 1888 for a two-year trip to Germany. He enrolled at Leipzig University, where he delved into experimental psychology and learned the foundations of empirical research in Wilhelm Wundt's laboratory, the first of its kind. At the University of Jena, he studied at the laboratory school, where he was introduced to Herbartism, or Johann Friedrich Herbart's philosophy of character-based education. Along with his formal studies, Rice visited dozens of schools all around Europe. He focused his visits keenly on observing pedagogy as well as the structures of the schooling system. Upon his return to the U.S. in 1890, Rice was ready to draw on his experiences in Europe and advocate for his vision of the future of American elementary education. Writing and publishingEarly articles for The Forum= Rice's brother Isaac Leopold Rice was the owner of The Forum, a monthly magazine published in New York. Rice published his first Forum article in 1891, calling for better teacher training and a more \\"scientific\\" approach to education that incorporated developmental psychology as well as measurable student outcomes. Rice subsequently undertook a sweeping six-month tour of U.S. schools in early 1892. He published his observations in nine Forum articles, criticizing schools for what he considered narrow, tedious, mechanical practices. Rice's critiques reached a wide audience and enraged many educators, bringing the question of schooling practices to the public. =The Public-School System of the United States (1893)= In 1893, Rice took another five-week tour of U.S. schools deemed to represent more progressive practices, in line with his vision for education. He wrote extensively on his visits to schools in Indianapolis, Minneapolis, St. Paul, La Porte, and Cook County, and was particularly impressed by Francis W. Parker's Cook County Normal School. He combined these observations with the original Forum articles for his first book, The Public-School System of the United States.Rice, J.M. (1983). The Public-School System of the United States (1893). New York: Arno Press and the New York Times. Made available as an e-book by the University of Toronto, Robarts Library. The book made a passionate argument for schools designed to benefit the child through improved teacher training, eliminating rote and \\"mechanical\\" recitation-based teaching, elimination of political squabbling on boards of educations, and stronger instructional supervision from the superintendent. =Pioneering the comparative test= In February 1895, Rice launched the one of the first comparative tests ever used in American education or psychology, a sixteen-month survey of almost 33,000 children between fourth and eight grade. Rice used this survey to collect data on school environments, children's nationality, and activities in school. Although not all educators were pleased with the results, Rice was widely acclaimed for this landmark early attempt to conduct an objective evaluation of education. In particular, he noted the \\"futility\\" of spelling drills, finding no correlation between the amount of drilling and spelling performance. Findings from Rice's survey study went into his subsequent works, The Rational Spelling Book (1898)Rice, J.M. (1898). The Rational Spelling Book. New York: American Book Company. Made available as an e-book by the University of California Libraries. and Scientific Management in Education (1913).Rice, J.M. (1913). Scientific Management in Education. New York: Publishers Printing Company. Made available as an e-book by the Library of Congress and the Sloan Foundation. =Later writing= Rice assumed editorship of The Forum between 1897 and 1907, during which time it shifted from a monthly to a quarterly publication. In 1915, he retired to Philadelphia and published his final book, The People's Government.Rice, J.M. (1915). The People's Government. Philadelphia, PA: The John C. Winston Company. Made available as an e-book by the Library of Congress. Educational Legacy There is a tremendous shift from Rice's 1893 work The Public School System of the United States, an impassioned condemnation of the lifelessness of schooling and his 1912 Scientific Management in Education which focused on the impassioned need for standardization and efficiency in the curriculum. According to Kliebard, \\"Rice's genuine dismay and disgust at was going on in American schools in the 1890s had evolved into a grim determination that teaches and administrators must be made to do the right thing.\\" He shifted from a concern in the humanitarian research into the stages of childhood development to zealous advocacy for scientific management techniques to enforce efficiency in instruction.(599-645) For his work Rice has been credited as both the founder of progressive education as well as the father of educational research. He has also been described as an educational muckraker and a founder of the American testing movement. Family life Rice married Deborah Levinson in 1900. They had a son, Lawrence Rice, and a daughter, Frances Rice. He died in Philadelphia on June 24, 1934.Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES (1934, June 25).\\"DR. JOSEPH M.

'Betjamin on Faith: An anthology of his religious prose', SPCK, 2011 Held to be one of the premier architectural works in Ealing, the Grade II* Listed building is noted for its combination of Arts & Crafts and late-Victorian Gothic as well as its west front and great west window.Cherry, B. and Pevsner, N. 'The Buildings of England London 3: North West', Yale, 2002 In addition to Sunday and weekday services, the church and adjacent hall serve as a hub for various community activities and events. Heritage ‚ÄúNotable for its unusual fusion of free Gothic style used in a highly original manner, St Peter‚Äôs occupies no small place in the last great age of church building‚Äù ‚Äì Sir Roy Strong.Hayes, R. 'New & Old: A History of St Peter's Mount Park Road, Ealing', St Peter's Church, Ealing 1985 Replacing an iron church which had stood on the site for 10 years, St Peter‚Äôs was built between 1892 and 1893 to accommodate the growing suburb of North Ealing. The original iron church had been dedicated to St Andrew and it was originally proposed to give the same name to the new church. However, when the Presbyterians started to build in Mount Park Road in 1889, the vestry felt 'that this Church should set the example of giving way in face of a threatened dispute about the Saint's name' and with commendable tact abandoned the 'Scottish' saint in favour of St Peter. The new building was designed by John Dando Sedding, the architect of Holy Trinity, Sloane Street but, following Sedding‚Äôs death, it was built under the direction of his pupil and successor in practice, the noted designer and architect Henry Wilson. The foundation stone was laid in 1893 by Princess Helena, Queen Victoria's third daughter. The building was consecrated the same year by Frederick Temple, Bishop of London and later Archbishop of Canterbury. Sedding‚Äôs plans for the church were complimented by The Builder magazine as ‚Äúa piece of real originality in design, which is refreshing to come across after seeing so many repetitions of old forms, Classic and Gothic‚Äù. Pevsner notes the ‚Äúadmirable use of Gothic forms ‚Äì especially the curvaceous forms of late Gothic ‚Äì to produce a building of great originality‚Äù. The church was added to extensively throughout the first quarter of the 20th century. In 1911, two doorways were created at the west end of each aisle, and in 1913 the Lady Chapel was built on the south side of the chancel. The north transept tower intended by Sedding was never built. The most notable feature of the building, the west front, has two small turrets on either side of large the recessed west window, which is unusually large with fine composite tracery. The exterior of the building is also of note on account of the long steep nave roof with shallow chains of arches connecting small turrets. Inside, much of the intended ornamentation was never completed. However, the building‚Äôs substantial four-bay nave with Gothic triforium,Jackson, E. 'Annals of Ealing', Phillimore & Co, 1898 allied with the clear glass of the windows and the lack of ornamentation, make the church unusually light and spacious. Singular features include the in 1913, and the inner west doors, with decorative Art Nouveau metalwork believed to be by Henry Wilson. Between 1921 and 1928 the Lady Chapel, originally constructed in 1913, was decorated and furnished as a War Memorial Chapel. Led by a War Memorial Committee, the scheme included the installation of an oak reredos, the decoration of the ceiling and a new screen between the Chapel and main Church. New altar rails were given in memory of Second Lieutenant Wilfred Holmes, son of Basil Holmes, a local politician and Isabella Holmes. The scheme also included the fine wall paintings of angels and the Virgin Mary over the reredos in the Lady Chapel, executed by Henry Charles Brewer in 1928. Despite a scheme of stained glass being designed for the whole church, only the four lights in the Lady Chapel (showing scenes from the Nativity) and two windows in the north aisle were ever completed. The existing stained glass was designed by Walter Towers of Kempe and Co. In the south aisle is a painting by Edward Arthur Fellowes Prynne, depicting Christ Before Pilate. Prynne was the brother the architect George Fellowes Prynne and lived in the Parish. The picture was given to the Church by Prynne's widow following his death in 1921. A campaign between 2011 and 2017 to restore the west window, and the high-level stonework on the north and south sides of the church raised almost ¬£1 million to carry out the necessary repair. This work was enabled through the assistance of English Heritage, the Heritage Lottery Fund, the National Churches Trust and others. Community St Peter's holds services on Sunday mornings and throughout the week in addition to major services at Easter and Christmas. It runs a local walking group, hosts the Ealing Churches Winter Night Shelter and an organ recital series. St Peter‚Äôs also holds an Amnesty Writing Letter Group, book club and junior church, and has a Sunday choir. The church is also a venue for Ealing Autumn Festival events and is used by local schools for concerts and carol services. Clergy Vicars 1894 - 1909: William Petty 1909 - 1916: Henry Austin Thompson.

While in hiding, he unearths the money from the stage coach. Leigh brings the real murderer of the messenger, \\"Black Jack\\" Hurley (Wallock), back to town where he gets his just deserts. Leigh is urged to remain in the town, and Rose Larkin (Breamer), daughter of the murdered messenger, promises to look after him. Cast *William S.

Mansfield was born about 1828 to Caroline Matilda Smith Mansfield and Joseph Mansfield. He had an older brother, Charles, a younger brother, Stanley, and a younger sister, Caroline. Mansfield met his future wife, Sarah H. Gannett, when they were both employed at the Boston Transcript, he as an apprentice and she as a \\"feeder,\\" working the presses. When their daughter Josie was born, the Mansfields lived on Kingston street. Three months later, the family moved to a boarding house at 13 Lincoln St. They later moved to 15 Crescent Place, where they lived for six months. In 1849 or 1850, Mansfield joined the California gold rush and left his wife and daughter in Boston. Shortly after his arrival in California, he went to work as a compositor on the Stockton Journal. On June 26, 1852, the California Census showed him living in San Joaquin County. By 1853, he had become editor of the San Joaquin Republican. On January 23, 1854, Mansfield became part owner of the newspaper and began to edit it as a voice of the Democratic Party. Mansfield became a close friend of John Bigler during his 1854 gubernatorial race, and promoted Bigler's candidacy in his newspaper. Meanwhile, also in the early part of 1854, John Tabor took over the Stockton Journal and edited as a voice of the Whig Party. Tabor supported Bigler's rival, George S. Waldo, for Governor of California in the Journal. The columns of these two newspapers were filled every day with rancor for the opposing candidate, and soon the editors began to disparage each other. On the evening of June 22, 1854, Tabor published an article severely criticizing Joseph Mansfield. The following morning at 9:00 a.m., as Mansfield stood on the corner of Levee and Center Streets talking with J. M. Schofield, the custom house collector, Tabor approached him. As Tabor was about to pass, Mansfield stepped in front of the editor and said, \\"Young man, I want to tell you what I think of you,\\" while raising his hand. Tabor immediately drew a revolver and fired. The ball struck Mansfield about two inches below his nipple. Tabor was immediately arrested and confined in the city prison. A mob threatened to break down the prison doors and hang Tabor immediately. Joseph Mansfield died at 2:00 that afternoon. The murder caused a stir throughout California, as both men were well known. Tabor was tried for the murder, was found guilty, and was sentenced to be hanged, March 16, 1855. Prominent citizens, judges, and the legislature sent petitions for pardon to Governor John Bigler. Even the legislature of Texas petitioned for his pardon. The governor finally relented and granted Tabor a full pardon.

Description The harlequin sandperch grows to a maximum length of . It is cylindrical at the front but somewhat compressed at the back. The head is large with an oblique mouth and the eyes set near the top. There is a spine on the operculum. The dorsal fin has five spines and twenty- one (occasionally twenty-two) soft rays. The fourth spine is the longest. The anal fin has a single spine and eighteen or nineteen soft rays. The general colour is pale reddish or greyish brown, shading to white on the underparts. There are large irregular reddish-brown blotches on the back, with six distinctive reddish-brown, squarish blotches below the lateral line. The dorsal fin has rows of small orange spots on the soft rays, and the anal fin has rows of white spots. The caudal fin is slightly rounded, the second to fourth rays are a little longer than the others, and the lowest quarter is reddish brown. Distribution and habitat The harlequin sandperch is native to shallow water in the western Indo-Pacific. Its range includes Zanzibar, India and Sri Lanka. Previously its range extended further east to include Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan, but the morphology of the fish in that region was slightly different and they are now recognised as a separate species, Parapercis pulchella. It is found at depths down to about on sandy bottoms in sheltered bays and estuaries. Biology The harlequin sandperch is often to be seen resting on the seabed, propped up on its pelvic fins.

The complex is evolutionarily conserved, although some of its components vary from species to species. In humans, the key proteins in the complex are RBL1 (p107) and RBL2 (p130), both of which are homologs of RB (p105) and bind E2F transcription factors; E2F4 and E2F5 transcription factors which repress gene expression; DP1, DP2 and DP3, dimerization partners of E2F; and MuvB, which is a complex of LIN9/37/52/54 and RBBP4.  Function  The main function of the DREAM complex is to repress gene expression during quiescence (G0). One of the genes repressed is the proto-oncogene Myc. Entry into G1 causes the dissociation of p130 from the complex, which prevents E2F4/5 from binding gene promoters. BMYB, which is repressed by the DREAM complex during G0 is expressed during G1 and it subsequently binds to MuvB during S phase to promote the expression of key G2/M phase genes such as CDK1 and CCNB1. FOXM1 is then recruited in G2 to further promote gene expression (e.g. AURKA). During late S phase BMYB is degraded via CUL1 (SCF complex), while FOXM1 is degraded during mitosis by the APC/C. The DREAM complex regulates cytokinesis through GAS2L3. In Drosophila melanogaster there is a testis-specific paralog of the Myb-MuvB/DREAM complex known as tMAC (testis-specific meiotic arrest complex), which is involved in meiotic arrest. Apart from its role in cell cycle control, the DREAM complex has been shown to be involved in the programmed cell death of neural precursor cells in Drosophila melanogaster.  Cancer therapy  Due to its regulatory role in the cell cycle, targeting the DREAM complex might enhance anticancer treatments such as imatinib.

His artistic career is as plural as his national identity. Born in Argentina in 1948, to Jewish parents of Polish descent, he emigrated alone to Israel at the age of 13. Biography After serving in the Israeli army, he developed a successful real estate business, while at the same time, beginning in 1980, he started producing films and studied at the Camera Obscura School in Tel Aviv. Among his best known films are: Nagua, Bar 51, Himo the King of Jerusalem (by filmmaker Amos Gutman) and the film The Elected (with Daniel Waksman). He was the director and screenwriter of the film Revenge of Itzik Finkelstein, which won seven awards from the Israeli Film Academy (including Best Film, Best Director and Best Screenplay) and represented Israel in 1994 at the Oscars. In 1993, he arrived in Cuba where he currently lives. In Cuba, he built the Miramar Trade Center, a major business complex in the city of Havana, which he still runs to this day. In this center, he has also created a significant Cuban art collection for the country. He wrote the novel Cejalinda, published under the title: La mujer de su vida, Quarto, Spain, in 2006. In Cuba, he began his photographic work. In 2010, his first series Sleeping with... (Dormir con) was exhibited at the Cuban Photo Library (National Photography Museum), which is now part of the collection of this institution and of numerous private and institutional collections, along with other works of his. Sleeping with... was selected by Discoveries of PhotoEspa√±a 2011. Today, his work has wide recognition amongst both the public and critics. He took part in the 2012 Havana Biennial with two of his series, The Family and Self-portraits. Among the most important series are: Self-portraits (2011‚Äì2014), The Family (2011‚Äì2013), Forgotten (2013), Cuts (2013‚Äì2014) as well as large format works such as The Line (2014), Centipede (2014) and photo installations: 19 women and one bed (2012) and The dance (2014). He collaborates with the new cultural project ‚ÄúCuban Art Factory‚Äù (F√°brica de Arte Cubano), promoting the development of contemporary photography and visual arts in Cuba. Photographic Work The photographic work of Enrique Rottenberg may be considered controversial, satirical, manic- melancholic, lewd, empathic, alarming...The reasons behind the attraction that it causes, whether it be of allure or tension, laughter or pain, surprise or rejection, beauty and horror, are diverse, but they all seem to be gathered in a certain way under the Schelling's definition of the term: the disturbing oddness or the ominous (unheimlich): \\"(...) everything that being intended to remain a secret, hidden, has come to light.\\" But yet, everything that seems obvious and familiar becomes paradoxical and borderline absurd. Perhaps Rottenberg's photography is an unsuspecting heir to his film imagery, and tries to represent timeless and motionless scenes, stunned characters, suspended environments, frozen stories, as if each and every one of them were shocked by suddenly coming to light, while remaining irremediably suspended. But this is the face-surface that is capable of opening towards another movement and another time, unknown, unusual, disjunct: the other scene ‚Äì the fantasy, and the other scene of reality. There is a movement that doesn't stop within Rottenberg's work, repeated and distressing, which builds its multiple layers, all the way from the greatly theatrical to the edge of reality, from the shadows of dreams to the brutal light of the vigil, from self-narcissism to mass psychology, to find the way out at any cost, reaching the encounter with what cannot be reconciled. In these provocations there's a struggle, away of resisting. Resisting the orders and those who dictate, but also the dominated and defeated; the gods, the myths, the mimicry and consensus, but to some instance of resisting to destiny itself, to all the established and pre- established destinies, even that off innateness and the indecipherable meaning of life? Rottenberg is a manufacturer of history, because history is the necessity of life, in its differences with death. He is also a destroyer of illusions. He has the ability to distress the subject, until he reveals some invisible, strange place within himself. The looks in his portraits are incisive, painful, powerful, and at the end of that open crack primary helplessness looms. In his composition she uses eloquent backgrounds, as if what is behind the scene were the undertone of his real meaning. Rottenberg's language is paradoxical, whence that feeling of surprise and perplexity: on one side he's directly affective unwilling to re-create metaphors; his images are cries, onomatopoeias, moans, silences; on the other hand, he makes poetry, creating metaphors as a side effect, immanent to affectionate, self-produced. Always multiple and open metaphors and symbols, but also downright personal. The disruption of the compositional syntax, the variety of colors found, the exposed textures, the bluntness, are what create a style, and at the limit, an enigma. A wandering language without a country, that of an identity that escapes from the identical, always becoming: becoming-man, becoming-animal, becoming-woman, becoming-mass, becoming-another... Statements of his series * Sleeping with...: This is a series that creates a testimony. Throughout the entire island of Cuba, hundreds of very diverse bedrooms were photographed, always encountering the unique characteristic of the Cuban idiosyncrasy that made it all possible: their hospitality. Trespassing the boundaries of public space in order to introduce ourselves into a home's most private place, where people spend a third of their lives, where they dream, lay sleepless, undress, procreate... The absence of its inhabitants gives life to the settings, objects, decorations, floors and walls, telling us the individual and collective history. (These images share the silence and the feeling of Suite Habana, by Fernando P√©rez). * The Family: The Family is our own mirror reversed once and again, a parody of society; each image takes to the absurd certain values and ideals, that are sold to us and dominate our existence. But more than that, they include in this same world things that in one way or another are excluded, not repeating publicly proclaimed consciousness; and seeing what happens at the limit. Therefore, this is a work ‚Äì experiment. * Forgotten: A witness of the forgotten souls that live in bygone colonial homes, ghosts with no present and without memories; witnesses of those forgotten who have forgotten themselves. (One more tribute to Memorias del Subdesarrollo/ Memories of Underdevelopment, by Tomas Guti√©rrez Alea) * Self-portraits: These are of imaginary beings with their plots and traumas, universal myths and personal fantasies, the dark sides of their neurosis and their social status. These are the result of intimate psychoanalytical sessions between me and the camera, that allow me to lighten the burden of being * Cuts: A portrait invites us to the inner self of a person, in order to discover their internal fissures, what happens when the image itself has a fissure? An unfinished image takes the spectator to share the incompleteness inherent to subjectivity and life itself, its divisions and gashes. These are portraits that expose the interior exile which for many is the main objective. * Utopia: In Enrique Rottenberg's recent compositions, gathered by under the misleading word Utopia, there is explicit movement from the self to the masses, from a self-referential subject to the artificial masses: man-mass, woman-mass, people-mass... Social mechanisms unfold on large formats, articulated bodies, connections, forming machine-like devices which consensus engineering puts into motion. These are photo installations of social installations, which make one or the other of its constructive elements visible, all acting on us without us actually realizing it, alienating elements brought to evidence. From its scaffolding emerges a social imaginary for minorities, understood by Deleuze as those are not represented in the consensus model, but rather those marginalized from it, lost, all invisible under cloak of the proposal of how to be happy, how to get goods, how to be recognized, how to exercise our sexuality, of ambiguous political ideals and even of standardized beauty, the Utopias of the social institutions.

The event was trademarked under the name Miss Drill Team U.S.A. and registered as a non-profit organization in 1973 by Dr. Kay Teer Crawford (creator of drill team, dance squad, and precision dance-sport teams). In 1989, the competition re-branded itself as Miss Dance Drill Team USA in an effort to recognize the varying performing arts interests of the many out-of-state teams that regularly traveled to Southern California to attend the annual event, which over the years has been held in the cities of Santa Monica, Los Angeles, Long Beach, and Irvine. U.S. Dance Nationals & Pageant The idea for a national drill team (dance team) competition was Dr. Kay Teer Crawford‚Äôs thesis project while studying at the University of Southern California for her Master‚Äôs Degree in Physical Education. The first ‚ÄúMiss Drill Team U.S.A.‚Äù national dance competition was held in 1968 at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Santa Monica, California. Teams from 56 high schools and colleges from across the United States participated in the inaugural event. At that time, there were only 3 team performance categories that were adjudicated at the national competition: Songleading (Pom), Baton Twirling (Majorette), and Flag Twirling. Team group performances were adjudicated in the areas of routine choreography, technical execution, and showmanship. The highlight of the event was the national soloist dance category. Solo title contestants were adjudicated in the same areas for their dance routine (with the first 10 seconds of the solo routine required to demonstrate military dance-drill stylized choreography). The soloist competition was structured much like a beauty pageant, and contestants were additionally required to perform a modeling presentation and deliver a speech on the subject of drill team. The inaugural U.S. national dance solo title winner to be crowned ‚ÄúMiss Drill Team U.S.A.‚Äù at the 1968 competition was Carolyn Buford from John F. Kennedy High School in Cyprus, CA. Awards for runner-up winners were presented as follows: *Miss Drill Team USA: Carolyn Buford (John F. Kennedy High School) *1st Runner-Up: Wendy Beesley (Mira Costa High School) *2nd Runner-Up: Vicki Jessop (Glendora High School) *3rd Runner- Up: Barbara Lopes (St. Joseph High School) *4th Runner-Up: Sue Wells (Cerritos College) Over 30 U.S. States have sent delegations of teams and soloists to the national dance competition since its inception. Regional Competitions Solo title dance nationals contestants must place in the Top 10 at an affiliated regional state dance competition (or qualify via video submission) in order to compete in the solo title pageant division at U.S. Nationals. Independently organized MDDTUSA regional charter organizations have operated region-specific events in numerous U.S. states and foreign countries, such as: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Texas, Utah, Washington, Japan, Australia, South Africa, and Brazil. Single performers not competing for the solo title and team group routines do not need to pre-qualify at a regional event; they can participate in the national competition at-will without any pre-qualification requirements.

Background After graduating from Union College, Butterworth became a lawyer working under fellow future regent Edward Tompkins. Butterworth moved to Mississippi to practice law. He was appointed United States Attorney in Mississippi during the administration on Martin van Buren. In 1840 Butterworth was involved in a lawsuit against himself and his business partner John D. Amis. The laws of Mississippi at the time forbade a writ of error in regards to the mandatory payment of a bond by the partners of a real estate bank on Columbus, Mississippi which Butterworth and Amis argued increased the costs of business unlawfully. The case went to the United States Supreme Court and decided in the partners' favor. Butterworth refused appointment to be a justice of Mississippi's Supreme Court in order to instead enter politics. In 1857 Butterworth became the first superintendent of the United States Assay Office in New York City where he lobbied for the creation of a branch mint in New York City. =California= Butterworth was president of the Quicksilver Mining Company (QSMC) of New York, which sought the New Almaden Mine near San Jose, California. In August 1863, Butterworth resigned his position as QSMC President and moved to California to become general manager of the company's newly-acquired the New Almaden mine, receiving an annual salary of . Under Butterworth's leadership the security and efficiency of the mine improved and profits increased. During the Civil War some of the mining camp's inhabitants formed a militia, the New Almaden Cavalry. Butterworth disallowed the militia from storing weapons on company property. Butterworth retired in July 1870, succeeded by James Butterworth Randol, his nephew. In 1869 Butterworth was one of the investors behind hydraulic mining outfit North Bloomfield Gravel Mining Company in Nevada County, California. He served as president of the company until his death. Butterworth was elected to the University of California Board of Regents for the term of 1868 to 1876 but he resigned in 1873. Butterworth was an advocate for eliminating the university's fees and giving female students the same opportunities as male students. Butterworth was also a commissioner of Golden Gate Park.

Gall, from her biographical note, ‚ÄúA Tentative Ramon Guthrie Chronology,‚Äù which is an addendum to the poetry in MSWOP, p. 205-210. Minor changes in the text have been footnoted and the poems she cites from it have also been footnoted but the narrative is Dr. Gall‚Äôs who says of it, ‚ÄúMuch of this biographical information comes from the poet himself, whose memory delighted his friends with its creativity and genius for self-revision.‚Äù When other sources of information are known they have also been footnoted. (he claimed his birth certificate said 13 January but his mother said 14 January) to Harry and Ella May Guthrie (n√©e Hollister). Supposedly named after a singer, Raymon Moore, he later discards both the ‚Äúy‚Äù and his middle name. He has an older sister, Eleanor, probably born in 1889. In 1898 or so Harry decamps with another woman and vanishes from sight. (Guthrie said his father eventually remarried and that he saw him only once again, in 1905, for a few minutes. He believed his father died in 1910 in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent another's suicide by gas.) Years of grinding poverty follow. Mrs. Guthrie moves to Hartford and supports her children with difficulty, running a boarding house, working as a dressmaker, Christian Science practitioner, and manicurist, etc. Due to her poor health the children probably spend a brief period in an orphanage when Guthrie is about five (despite his mother's Connecticut relatives). After completing grammar school, Guthrie is unable, for financial reasons, to accept a scholarship to the Hartford Art School. He works at odd jobs and in the Underwood typewriter factory and flunks out of night school. From 1912 to 1915, however, he manages to attend the Northfield Mount Hermon School (in Massachusetts) for part of cadi year. Several of his poems appear in The Hermonite. (Sec \\"The Archangel Michael‚Äù MSWOP p. 103 for Mount Hermon's evangelical flavor.) In 1915 Mrs. Guthrie has her first stroke and moves in with a sister near New Haven. Guthrie goes to work for the Winchester Repeating Arms factory in New Haven, at this time busy filling war orders. He works on the night shift straightening draw punches. After another stroke early in 1916 his mother commits suicide in the charity ward of the New Haven Hospital. (See ‚ÄúFiercer Than Evening Wolves‚Äù MSWOP p. 111 for details of this early period.) =1916-22: War and coming of age in France= Guthrie decides not to return to Mount Hermon in the fall and instead enlists in the 10th Connecticut Field Artillery. (Eleanor, whom Guthrie remembered as given to temper tantrums, has married. She and her brother are essentially estranged from 1916 on. Guthrie said she later married Lt. Col. Charles Wallington Furlong and was a friend of Mary Baker Eddy.) In December, however, he sails for France as a volunteer with the American Field Service and is an ambulance driver with the Eighth Army on the Western Front for several months and then with the Armee de l‚ÄôOrient in the Balkans. Returning to France, Guthrie joins the U.S. Army's Aviation Section Signal Corps and trains as an observer. (He said he was afraid the war would be over before he could complete training as a pilot.) He walks away from a spectacular plane crash, which results in bouts of amnesia (see ‚Äú ‚ÄòVisse, Scrisse, Amo‚Äô ‚ÄùMSWOP p.183 ) and various nervous disorders, among them acusis‚Äîintolerance of loud noise‚Äîand acute attacks of anxiety and panic. (The crash is severe enough to entitle him to a disability pension.) He is assigned to the Eleventh Bombing Squadron and participates in a disastrous raid over La Chaussee in which an incompetent major sends the planes aloft with machine guns out of order and without a fighter escort. Guthrie and his pilot, the only survivors, are forced to watch the other planes shot down (see ‚ÄúDeath with Pants On‚ÄùMSWOP p. 158 ). Fortunately, their machine gun is working, and Guthrie shoots down two enemy fighters and survives to become a successful formation leader and to shoot down two more. He is awarded two citations, one of them the Silver Star. While serving in the army he discovers Paris and his future wife, Marguerite Maurey from Nancy. At the end of the war he takes a course in French civilization at the Sorbonne, but in the summer of 1919 he is shipped back to the States. After several hospitalizations (see his novel Parachute, based on a hospital for convalescent airmen in Cooperstown) and a few months‚Äô work as an insurance investigator, he returns to France. His poems appear in Norman Fitts's little magazine S4N (which Fitts had founded along with Guthrie, Stephen Vincent Benet, Roger Sessions, Thornton Wilder, and others), and in Paris Review: The Illustrated American Magazine in France. He studies political science at Toulouse under a disability pension, earning two special degrees for foreigners, the license and doctorat en droit, in 1921 and 1922; but he continues his literary studies and poetry, including translations from the Proven√ßal. =1922-29: The flourishing of a poet- novelist-translator= On 8 April 1922 Guthrie marries Marguerite in Toulouse. They move to Paris, and during 1922-23 he works on a semi-autobiographical novel, ‚ÄúPhilip‚Äù (unpublished except for one chapter, ‚ÄúMarchand d‚Äôhabits,‚Äù in the January‚ÄìFebruary 1923 issue of S4N). He writes poetry, follows courses at the Sorbonne in Old French and Proven√ßal, is rumored to have become one of Otto Rank's patients, and participates in the literary and artistic life centered in Montparnasse. (See ‚ÄúEzra Pound in Paris and Elsewhere,‚Äù MSWOP p. 32 ‚ÄúMontparnasse,‚ÄùMSWOP p. 96 and ‚ÄúFor Approximately the Same Reason.‚ÄùMSWOP p. 160 ) The Guthries return to the United States in 1923, also the year of his first collection of poems, Trobar Clus (the first book put out by the S4N Society). Malcolm Cowley introduces Guthrie to the avant-garde literary scene in New York, but Guthrie's search for a job takes him to the University of Arizona, where he teaches French language and literature courses from 1924 to 1926. (See ‚ÄúThe Clown: Hurrah for the Petrified Forest‚ÄùMSWOP p. 10 and ‚ÄúThere Are Those.‚ÄùMSWOP p. 115 ) In 1926 the Guthries return to France and the eminently congenial expatriate milieu‚Äîpartly at the instigation of Sinclair Lewis, whose collaboration with and dependence on Guthrie absorb much of the poet's time and energy over the next decades. Besides Trobar Clus (1923), Guthrie publishes his novel Marcabrun (1926); another collection of poems (A World Too Old, 1927); a translation of Bernard Fay's The Revolutionary Spirit in France and America (1927); a second novel (Parachute, 1928); and the risqu√© narrative poem The Legend of Ermengarde (1929). That year the Guthries return to the United States, probably for economic reason. =1930-63: The Dartmouth years and relative poetic silence= From 1930 to 1963, except for a stint in the O.S.S. during World War II in France and Algiers as liaison with the French Resistance (for which he is also cited)‚Äîsee ‚ÄúFragment of a Travelogue‚ÄùMSWOP p. 29 and ‚ÄúFor Approximately the Same Reason‚Äù‚ÄîGuthrie teaches full-time at Dartmouth College (Hanover, New Hampshire), specializing in Proust. He makes his home across the border in Norwich, Vermont, and returns to France as frequently as possible during vacations and sabbaticals, often to paint rather than write. (He once figured that he had lived 16 years in France.) He is made an Officier d‚ÄôAcademie in 1949 and an Officier dans I‚Äôordre des Palmes academiques in 1963 (see ‚ÄúPattern for a Brocade Shroud‚ÄùMSWOP p. 42 ). His scholarly enterprises include occasional articles, among them discussions of his close relationship with Lewis; a number of reviews‚Äîespecially for the New York Herald Tribune Book Review; the preparation of two anthologies (with George E. Diller): French Literature and Thought Since the Revolution (1942) and Prose and Poetry of Modem France (1964); and two 1947 translations: The Republic of Silence, compiled by A.J. Liebling, and The Other Kingdom, by David Rousset. Guthrie, however, does not abandon poetry entirely during this period. In 1933 The Arts Press (Hanover) brings out his Scherzo from a Poem To Be Entitled The Proud City; in 1938 he writes his long, anti-Fascist, unpublished poem ‚ÄúInstead of Abel‚Äù; he participates in the Thursday evening meetings of poets living in the area (among them Richard Eberhart, Bink Noll, Thomas and Vera Vance, and Alexander Laing and‚Äîespecially‚Äîhis wife Dilys); and he puts together the manuscript of Graffiti (1959) for M.L. Rosenthal, then poetry advisor at Macmillan, who has also published some of his poems in The Nation. As his retirement from full- time teaching approaches (1963‚Äîalthough he teaches through the fall semester of 1965), his poetic output increases markedly. =1964-73: Guthrie‚Äôs last years and his final poetic flourishing= His renaissance occurs against the backdrop of his escalating medical problems and the Vietnam War. He vehemently opposes the war‚Äîsee ‚ÄúSome of Us Must Remember‚ÄùMSWOP p. 80 and ‚ÄúScherzo for a Dirge‚ÄùMSWOP p. 82 ‚Äîand in 1965 returns his World War I Silver Star to President Johnson in protest. His first operation for cancer of the bladder takes place in the summer of 1966, and he starts on Maximum Security Ward. He is well enough in 1967 to give some readings in France and to spend time at Yaddo, but is very ill at the beginning of 1968 and starts a course of cobalt therapy. Alexander Laing raises a subscription from Guthrie's former students and other supporters so that Emile Capouya accepts Asbestos Phoenix for Funk & Wagnalls in January. Guthrie is never aware of this arrangement.Correspondence of Alexander Laing in the Guthrie papers of the Rauner. Despite his physical condition, Guthrie spends late spring and summer in Paris. (See ‚ÄúBoul Miche, May 1968.‚ÄùMSWOP p. 123 ) Back home he races to correct the galleys of Asbestos Phoenix before undergoing surgery to remove his colon, which has been severely damaged by the cobalt treatment. Despite the dangerous operation and massive transfusions, he recovers enough to see Asbestos Phoenix in print and to return to Paris in the summer of 1969, but there he hemorrhages badly and ends up in the American Hospital. (See ‚ÄúThe Dutch Head Nurse.‚ÄùMSWOP p. 154 ) He is shipped home in such poor condition that he is not expected to recover, but with Maximum Security Ward not quite finished he insists on being taken off pain-killers so that he can complete it. By October it is at the typist's, and Robert Giroux accepts it in the spring of 1970 for Farrar, Straus & Giroux. From now until his death Guthrie is essentially house- and hospital- bound. More operations follow, and he is too sick in May 1970 (he is in fact unconscious for most of six weeks) to accept the Marjorie Peabody Waite Award of the National Institute of Arts and Letters in person, and Cowley accepts for him. But by June 1971 he is well enough to attend the Dartmouth commencement ceremonies, during which he is elected an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa and receives the Litt.D. Compounding his surgical problems, however, are Parkinson's Disease, asthma, double vision, and eventually hallucinations, he is hospitalized for much of 1972 and 1973. 22 November 1973, Thanksgiving Day, having finally succeeded in getting himself released from the hospital but not from his unrelenting physical and mental torment, Guthrie takes an overdose of phenobarbital.Autopsy report in the Guthrie papers in the Rauner He dies at Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital in Hanover in the afternoon. His grave, marked by a miniature dolmen, overlooks Norwich. Marguerite dies three years later.

She is regarded as revolutionizing California design and for her advocacy of craft as an art form. Believing that craft was as high a calling as more traditional forms of art, Moore sought to blur the distinction between the two. She promoted the New Craftsman Movement, which fostered the contributions of people working in the crafts, developed links between craftspeople and manufacturers, and railed against the dehumanizing effects of the industrial revolution which, in the context of made objects, she saw as destructive to individual effort and expression as it corporatized the creative act.  Early life  Moore was born Eudorah Goodell Morse in Denver, Colorado to Bradish P. and Anna Earll Reynolds Morse. Her father ran the specialist mining and machinery concern Morse Brothers Machinery Company, and her mother was the daughter of Colorado mining pioneer Albert Eugene Reynolds. She graduated from Smith College in 1940. She was the sister of businessman and philanthropist Albert Reynolds Morse. Career Moore‚Äôs first excursion into the design field (and her only effort at actually designing) was the creation of a sandal in the early 1940s that she sold to high-end stores in Los Angeles. In the early 1950s, Moore became the founding president of the Pasadena Art Alliance, which was organized to provide support to art institutions in Pasadena, particularly the Pasadena Art Museum. By 1957 she was president of the board of the museum. Continuing her long-standing interest in crafts, in 1961 she took over the Museum‚Äôs series of California Design exhibitions, changing them from small, annual shows of furniture into \\"a blockbuster juried triennial\\" of virtually anything designed or made in California. Moore produced California Design shows for the museum in 1962, 1965, 1968, and 1971 and related exhibitions in 1974 (California Design 1910) and 1976 (California Design ‚Äô76) at other venues. She was curator of design of the museum from 1962 to 1974, when the Pasadena Art Museum closed and became the Norton Simon Museum. In addition to the California Design exhibitions, Moore prepared and edited books and filmstrips on design and organized and mounted a variety of other exhibitions and activities in the crafts, including Islands in the Land, about traditional crafts, and the international symposium Fiber as Medium. She also conceived Craftsman Lifestyle: The Gentle Revolution (1976), written by Olivia Emery, and was the moving force behind a review of contemporary American design titled Design U.S.A. (1972). From 1978 to 1981 Moore served as crafts coordinator at the National Endowment for the Arts. In this position, she campaigned for greater recognition of crafts on a national scale and worked on initiatives to secure the future of craft in America. In particular, she instituted a grant program that encouraged craft practitioners and artists to work in collaboration with architects, planners, and builders. Moore saw crafts and design as essential components in the lives of everyone and in all her initiatives, she sought to place handmade goods in the greater perspective of society. Moore was recognized many times over for her tireless promotion of the arts both in California and across the nation. She received the Trailblazer Award of the National Home Fashions League in 1971, the Smith College Medal in 1973, and an honorary doctorate from the California College of Arts & Crafts (now California College of the Arts) in 1979. She was made an Honorary College of Fellows member of the American Craft Council in 1980. The October/November 1981 issue of American Craft noted that \\"With an unflagging interest, intelligence, and energy, Eudorah Moore has celebrated the American craftsman as designer, artist and vital force.\\" Through her exhibitions and national campaigns, Moore not only helped elevate California crafts and design but also the status of handmade goods in America.  Personal life  While attending Smith College, she met Anson Churchill Moore of New Rochelle, New York, whom she married shortly after her graduation in 1940. The couple moved to the Los Angeles area after their wedding and lived there, with the exception of a 2-year hiatus in Richmond, Virginia, for the rest of their lives. They settled in Pasadena, where they raised four children. Quotes \\"The social as well as the physical climate of California in the 20th century has presented the ideal breeding ground for the new, and more broadly based wave of humane declaration, which we call the New Craftman's Movement. With remnants of the do-it-yourself need of the frontier spirit still intact, and with the sense of individual worth and identity from that experience still within memory, there was little in subjugation or established pattern to overcome. Self-expression was in many ways the base of the culture.\\" See also * List of people from Denver, Colorado * List of people from Pasadena, California References Category:American art curators Category:Women curators Category:American designers Category:1918 births Category:2013 deaths Category:People from Pasadena, California Category:Culture of Pasadena, California Category:National Endowment for the Arts Category:Place of birth missing Category:Place of death missing Category:20th-century United States government officials Category:21st-century American people Category:People associated with the Norton Simon Museum ","title":"Eudorah Moore"},{"id":"45647859","text":"Rank comparison chart of air forces of Oceanian states.

He was director of the AP-HP (Paris hospital group) Laboratory of Auditory Prosthesis and director of the ENT Research Laboratory at Paris-Saint-Antoine University Hospital from 1967 to 2001. He was also head of the institution's ENT Department from 1978 to 1998. In 1982, he was elected a member of the International Collegium ORL-AS.Collegium International d‚ÄôO.R.L. He achieved worldwide recognition in the late 1970s thanks to the work completed by his Paris laboratory's multidisciplinary team on the multichannel cochlear implant. This implanted electronic hearing device was developed at Saint- Antoine and alleviates bilateral total deafness. When implanted early in young children, it can also help overcome the spoken language problems associated with deafness.  Biography  Claude-Henri Chouard comes from a long line of academics and doctors. His father, Pierre Chouard (1903‚Äì1983), was Professor of Plant Physiology at the Sorbonne, and founder and director of the Gif-sur- Yvette Phytotron. He was a Lay Dominican and for many years President of the International Society of St Vincent de Paul.http://www.vinnies.org.au/icms_docs/181567_The_Record_Spring_2010.pdf His grandfather, Jules Chouard, was a journalist and a writer. His great grandfather, Martin-Jules Chouard, was a primary school teacher and a painter. His mother, Denise Petit-Dutaillis, was the daughter of Dr Paul Petit- Dutaillis, a navy surgeon and, later, a gynaecologist at Saint Michel Hospital, Paris. His mother's uncle was Professor Charles Petit-Dutaillis, a member of the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and president of the Institut de France. Her brother was Professor Daniel Petit-Dutaillis, a neurosurgeon at Piti√© Salp√™tri√®re Hospital and a member of the Acad√©mie Nationale de M√©decine. Claude-Henri Chouard married Isabelle, the elder daughter of the four girls of Pierre Sainflou (1917‚Äì2007) Polytechnitien, X- 37, scientific film-maker: they had 4 children. = Training = Claude Henri Chouard first year of Medicine Faculty (1950) Claude-Henri Chouard initially trained under neurologist Raymond Garcin and neuropsychiatrist No√´l Peron, at Salp√™tri√®re Hospital, before spending 30 months doing military service in Algeria. He then completed his internship in the Paris hospital system, under Henri Gu√©nin and Daniel Morel-Fatio, and later Paul Pialoux and Maurice Aubry, who were ENT specialists and members of the Acad√©mie de M√©decine. During his internship, he also studied politics and management at Sciences Po from Paris and completed research in neuroanatomy at Andr√© Delmas' laboratory, with Charles Eyri√®s. For over half a century, Claude-Henri Chouard's passion has been the complex relationship between doctor and patient: this passion has been at the heart of all his clinical training and is the reason he has never stopped practising.  Scientific contributions  Claude-Henri Chouard has made a unique and personal contribution to all three fields in which he has worked. The first two fields have often required him to draw on his surgical experience and clinical empathy. = The multichannel cochlear implant = The multichannel cochlear implant was designed and developed in 1975 at Saint- Antoine Hospital by a multidisciplinary team formed by Patrick MacLeod and Claude-Henri Chouard for this very purpose. For over eight years, these researchers were well ahead of all the other international teams, until the collapse of French company Bertin temporarily put paid to their progress. However, the core principles established by the researchers in the patents taken out by Bertin Technologieshttp://recorlsa.online.fr/implantcochleaire/historicfrancaisenanglais.html#frenchpatents in 1977 are still used by today's manufacturers of multichannel implanted auditory prostheses, both intracochlear and auditory brain stem. In 1957, in Paris, Andr√© Djourno, a professor of medical physics, and Charles Eyri√®s, a Parisian otologist, restored basic hearing to a completely deaf patient with bilateral cholesteatoma by electrically stimulating acoustic nerve fibres still present in the inner ear. Although this system‚Äîwhich was further developed several years later by William House in Los Angeles‚Äîrepresented huge progress in that it freed patients from the silence and isolation in which they were trapped as a result of total deafness, the device never managed to enable patients to identify words without lip reading. After twelve years of trials, the researchers all agreed on one thing: to achieve the level of performance required to give these patients a comfortable social life, the cochlear implant would need several electrodes, so it could stimulate the different frequency regions on the \\"cochlear keyboard\\", which were identified by 1961 Nobel Prize winner Georg von B√©k√©sy. However, all the researchers hesitated in moving forward, fearful of failure and major complications. In 1973,Chouard C.H., Mac Leod P., 1973. La r√©habilitation des surdit√©s totales: essai de l'implantation cochl√©aire d'√©lectrodes multiples. La Nouvelle Presse M√©dicale. ; 44: 2958 after closely studying the tentative results achieved thus far, C.H. Chouard and Dr P. MacLeod, who had completed their medical training together, decided to tackle the problem. P. MacLeod was by now a researcher specialising in sensory physiology, while C.H. Chouard had personal experience of performing surgery on the facial and vestibular nerves. They decided to combine these skills and form a multidisciplinary team within the ENT Research Laboratory at Saint-Antoine University Hospital in Paris. In 1975, they performed a fully ethical study on three patients with recent traumatic unilateral total deafness and total facial paralysis, which required surgery. The study showed that selective electrical stimulation of eight to twelve electrodes, each isolated from the others, placed in different locations within the tympanic duct of the cochlear, resulted in the perception of different frequencies. Then, after developing a round window electrical stimulation test to confirm the presence of functional auditory fibres, the Paris-based team applied the electrode implantation technique to five patients with historic bilateral total deafness. Following the surgery, and after undergoing relatively brief speech therapy, all the patients‚Äîwho were totally deaf‚Äîwere able to recognise a varying percentage of words without lip reading. French company Bertin was then selected to manufacture a functional implantable device, under the scientific direction of P. MacLeod. The table- top device was built quickly, but the untimely death of Jean Bertin at the end of 1975 resulted in the company being restructured, and the French researchers had to wait until summer 1976 to finally receive the first six devices. The first implant was fitted at Saint-Antoine Hospital on Wednesday 22 September 1976, by C.H. Chouard, assisted by Bernard Meyer. The first patient's hearing returned the following day, and the five other patients soon underwent surgery. Bertin filed patent no. 77/07824 on 16 March 1977. It was based on MacLeod's physiological criteria and made two simultaneous claims: * - The sequential transmission to the cochlea of an indeterminate number of frequency bands * - The transmission of all audible sound information. The first results were presented the following day at the eleventh ENT World Congress in Buenos Aires, and published shortly afterwards. Claude Henri Chouard (center), Bernard Meyer (right) and Caroline de Monaco at St Antoine Hospital (1993) For nearly twenty years, this document influenced all the procedures used and research undertaken by other international teams, who were obliged to find ways around the claims‚Äîusually by transmitting only part of the speech information‚Äîuntil the patent fell into the public domain in 1997. In 1982, at a meeting organised by the New York Academy of Sciences to review the multichannel cochlear implant, Chouard and his team presented results obtained from 48 patients (45 of whom had received an implant over one year previously) . Their paper also detailed multiple innovations designed to improve rehabilitation and enable the implant to adapt to the specific characteristics of any remaining auditory fibres. These procedures were later adopted by all the other international teams. The results presented by all the other teams during the conference related to just less than ten patients (based on the total number of deaf patients treated with a multichannel system). Also in 1982, Claude-Henri Chouard used Born's reconstruction technique, which he had employed twenty years earlier during his neuro-anatomical research with C. Eyri√®s (see below), to demonstrate‚Äîinitially in animals‚Äîthat the device needs to be implanted as early as possible, in order to avoid atrophy of the central auditory structures. His observations clearly show that this phenomenon occurs very quickly in cases of persistent neonatal deafness. A few years later, after multiple delays to the delivery of the fully digital device that MacLeod and Chouard had been requesting since 1980, Bertin abandoned the implant and, in 1987, sold the licence to another French company: MXM-Neurelec. Meanwhile, as Bertin's apparent disinterest in the French device resulted in slow progress, the American Blake S. Wilson came up with a sound signal processing strategy directly inspired by the French researchers' work and patent, although the author never made reference to this in any of his subsequent publications. Since early 2014, several corrections,Chouard CH. Technical survey of the French role in multichannel cochlear implant development. Acta Otolaryngol. 2014 Dec 10:1-9. have been published to address this surprising oversight, referring notably to numerous previous works by the Parisian team. In 1991, MXM-Neurelec presented its first multichannel implant. It was fully digitised and could be adapted to ossified cochleas. The implant was based on the Bertin licence, but its development was very closely guided by suggestions from researchers at the Saint-Antoine ENT Research Laboratory in Paris. From 1992 onwards, the multichannel cochlear implant gradually gained acceptance in France. Today, in 2015, most of the principles established by Claude-Henri Chouard and Patrick MacLeod's team between 1976 and 1977 are still used by all manufacturers of cochlear implants and auditory brain stem implants. = Snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea = Between 1984 and 1990, encouraged by his assistants Prof. Bernard Meyer and Fr√©deric Chabolle, and with the help of pulmonologist Prof. Bernard Fleury and cardiologist Prof. Jean Valty of Saint- Antoine Hospital, Claude-Henri Chouard began studying the symptomatology and epidemiology of the complications of a new disease in the field of ENT. He named this disease chronic rhonchopathy. The main symptom is snoring, which no one had previously viewed as a relevant sign of disease. In fact, the louder the snoring, the greater the risk that it is associated with severe obstructive sleep apnoea. After laying the foundations for treatment development with his students, Claude-Henri Chouardhttp://recorlsa.online.fr//ronflement/index.html ceased to be personally involved in this area of research, leaving the youngest members of his team to continue enhancing our knowledge of this new disease and perfecting the corresponding treatments. = Neuroanatomy = During the mid- twentieth century, Charles Eyri√®s was a researcher in the anatomy laboratory run by Prof. Andr√© Delmas, spending his mornings as an ENT surgeon and his afternoons as a neuroanatomist. Claude-Henri Chouard was one of his students between 1960 and 1966. Eyri√®s taught him Born's method for 3D reconstruction of histological sections at a magnification of 100 and 150. This technique was to prove useful twenty years later, when Chouard showed that children with neonatal deafness need to receive implants as early as possible, before the auditory brain structures begin to atrophy 5. Chouard became familiar with total deafness very early on in his career, since he had direct access to information on the famous electro-therapeutic trials performed by Eyri√®s in 1957 with Andr√© Djourno. Claude-Henri Chouard also identified the functional origins of acoustico-facial anastomoses by following the reconstructed nerve fibres from one end to the other. This helped explain the effectiveness of certain treatments for Meni√®re's disease and revealed the route taken by efferent fibres in the inner ear. By using the same approach to reconstruct the solitary tract and its gustatory nuclei,Eyri√®s C, Chouard CH. Le faisceau solitaire. Ann. Oto-Laryng. (Paris) 1965; 82: 15-36. he observed that the nucleus of the last brachial nerve, the pneumogastric nerve, extended a long way down, undoubtedly causing afferent sensitivity of the enteric and airway pathways. This hypothesis has been the electro-physiological existence of which was recently demonstrated within the intestines, and which could potentially play a role in certain forms of diabetes.Adachi A., Shimizu N., Oomura Y., Kobashi M. - Convergence of hepatoportal glucose-sensitive afferent signals to glucose-sensitive units within the nucleus of the solitary tract.

Writing  Painting  He is also passionate about the visual arts, to which he was introduced at a young age, via the paintings of his great grandfather, Martin-Jules Chouard. From the age of 13, Claude-Henri Chouard was an amateur artist, working with a variety of media, including photography, and later incorporated film and television into his medical teaching. He exhibited his work regularly from 1982 onwards.

Early history Bethel was established in 1860 when thirty members from Salem, Robertstown broke away to establish a new church. The chapel was designed by Evan Jones of Aberdare and built at a cost of ¬£747. The original chapel seated 600 people. The first minister was William Harrison who was followed in 1859 by Hugh Hughes, known as Huw Tegai. He was previously a minister in Manchester but died suddenly in 1864, three days after collapsing while preaching in the pulpit. Robert Evans was minister from 1866 until 1877 and D, Onllwyn Brace from 1885 until 1888. The membership in 1890 was 245. This rose to 344 in 1905, in the wake of the religious revival but fell to 280 by 1914. J. Richards was minister from the late 1890s until 1907 when he departed for Bethel, Caernarfonshire. New Theology Controversy Shortly afterwards divisions arose in the church over the New Theology, which led to the resignation of four deacons and a public dispute over the election of a treasurer to succeed one of those who had resigned. This doctrine, championed by R.J. Campbell gained significant support in South Wales at this time. This reflected the growing political tensions within nonconformity in the Aberdare Valley following the election of James Keir Hardie as MP for Merthyr Boroughs eight years earlier. The chapel secretary sought to play down the division claiming that they involved only a small proportion of the membership. However, 24 members were said to be supported of Campbell's views and were said to include all those who attended a Bible class on Sunday mornings. Twentieth Century In 1913 the chapel was rebuilt at a cost of ¬£2,975 with an organ costing ¬£420. The new chapel had an elaborate interior including a ceiling covered with roses and a substantial gallery with an organ chamber at the far end. Bethel remained open until the late 1980s. Derelict through the 1990s it was demolished in November 2003 and a house was built on the site.

The Community, which is not recognized as genuine Islamic by mainstream Muslims, faces persecution and experiences matrimonial restrictions imposed by local Sharia courts. Although no estimates are available, reports suggest that there may be \\"dozens\\" of Palestinian Ahmadi Muslims in the West Bank. History The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in Palestine shares its earliest history with the history of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in Israel, when the second caliph of the Community, Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad toured the Middle East in 1924 and visited Jerusalem, in what was then the British Mandate of Palestine. The first converts to the movement belonged to the Odeh tribe who originated from Ni'lin a small village, north-west of Jerusalem. In the 1950s, after the establishment of Israel, many Palestinian Ahmadis left Ni'lin and settled in Haifa, Israel. Modern statusWest Bank= The Community is distributed all over the West Bank and is present in the majority of the Governorates. According to the President of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in Israel, there is a \\"growing trend of West Bank Palestinians joining the Ahmadiyya community.\\" Ahmadiyya teachings have been labelled as apostasy by Palestinian National Authority-appointed clerics, which has left many of its members open to persecution. Although the death penalty is not imposed on the Palestinian Ahmadis in spite of the apostasy laws that call for the death penalty, Ahmadis have been beaten and have had their properties destroyed. Palestinian Authority officials have refused calls to defend the rights of Ahmadi Muslims, saying that their status is in the hands of the courts. Ahmadi Muslims have reported of cases in which the local Sharia courts have dissolved marriages of several Ahmadi couples, leaving many of them in a legal limbo. In Tulkarem, an Ahmadi couple was branded apostate by a local court who annulled their marriage. Another couple, from the same town, in which only the husband was an Ahmadi, met a similar fate. According to Ahmadi leaders, an Ahmadi Muslim man from Shechem was ordered to divorce his wife and let go of his property. In February 2014, the Palestinian General Investigation Service in Hebron arrested 3 Ahmadi Muslims when they attempted to obtain permission in order to distribute leaflets related to their faith. Accused of inciting sectarian strife, they were referred to the General Prosecution for investigation. A court issued a decision to extend their detention pending investigation. Within a few days, the Palestinian police in Hebron arrested 8 more Ahmadi Muslims on the grounds of distributing leaflets. They all later appeared before Hebron's Magistrates' court that issued a decision to extend their detention to 15 more days. =Gaza Strip= The Community has presence in major cities across the Gaza Strip, including the city of Gaza, Khan Yunis and Rafah.

Life  Map of the Byzantine‚ÄìBulgarian wars in the time of Emperor Basil II and Tsar Samuel of Bulgaria His name is the hellenized form of Armenian T‚Äòot‚Äòorakan (\\"belonging to Theodore\\"). A series of seals attributed to him by Ivan Jordanov allows a tentative reconstruction of his early career, holding the ranks of protospatharios and epi tou Chrysotriklinou and serving as the strategos (military governor) of Artze and as archegetes of the East. It is likely that he was strategos of Artze between 975 and 979, as the fortress was in Byzantine hands at that time, and was then promoted to archegetes, an office recently created that entailed overall command over the professional (and mostly Armenian) infantry of the eastern field armies. He is first directly mentioned in the historical writings of John Skylitzes in the 990s (ca. 994 according to Nicholas Adontz), when he was appointed by Emperor Basil II, at the time embroiled in the long war with Bulgaria, as strategos in Philippopolis. In the year 1000, along with Nikephoros Xiphias, he led an army that rapidly captured the Bulgarian fortresses of Great Preslav, Little Preslav (Presthlavitza) and Pliska, completing the re-imposition of Byzantine control over the northeastern portions of the Bulgarian state, first conquered by Emperor John Tzimiskes in the early 970s. Shortly after, Theodorokanos retired due to his advanced age, and was replaced by Xiphias. The generals George Theodorokanos and Basil Theodorokanos, active later in the 11th century, were considered his sons by Adontz, but, although likely, such a relationship cannot be proven.

Advanced Papyrological Information System (APIS UM). Accessed March 30, 2019 See the section on the place, date, and purpose of the writing of the letter in the article on Epistle to the Ephesians for more details. =Verse 2= : Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.: NKJV The Blessing of God (1:3‚Äì14) Theologian James Dunn considers this section \\"one of the most beautiful passages in the Bible\\" among Christian praise, \\"unlike anything else in Pauline letters\\". The Greek text of this part can be punctuated as a single sentence. It contains a four-dimensional blessing, sketched a circle starting from God and directing to God as the source and resource of it, reaching from the time \\"before the foundation of the world\\" (verse 4), into the revelation of the divine mystery (verse 9), until the end of time (\\"the fullness of time\\") to \\"sum up everything in Christ\\" (verse 10) with \\"the Spirit as the guarantee\\" of \\"the final redemption of God's own possession\\" (verse 14). =Verse 3= :Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ.: NKJV An rhetorical antanaclasis: God has blessed us in one sense, we bless Him in another;Bengel, J.

Codex Alexandrinus alone reads \\"we\\" (Œ∑ŒºŒµŒπœÇ), instead of \\"you\\". *\\"The word of truth\\" here refers to \\"the Gospel of your salvation\\", while the Jews use the phrase for \\"sublime and heavenly doctrine\\". Paul uses it to denote the \\"declaration and publication of salvation by Christ\\", in which they believed after hearing it. *\\"You were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise\\": this is to be understood as the action of the Spirit who confirms, certifies, and assures the believers of their interest in God's favor, as well as the blessings of grace and their right to the heavenly glory (cf. 2 Corinthians 1:22). This seal is not circumcision, baptism, the Holy Communion/Lord's supper, nor the graces of the Spirit, but the Spirit himself, who conveys the truth to the spirits of believers, and as a \\"spirit of promise\\" that is, the Spirit who is promised by Father and Christ, and who is sent by them the Holy Spirit seals or certifies believers about the truth of the things above, by opening and applying the promise to them, to leave a greater impression of holiness on the soul, and more acts of holiness. This cannot be the same as the seal of the Father for his elected people (\\"the seal of his foreknowledge\\"; ) because that was before faith, and is within himself, not on them, thus it is different from the Spirit's work. For the same reasons, it cannot be the Son's affection to the people, placing them as \\"a seal on his arm and his heart\\" (), or his asserting in them as his property, as well as their security and protection (; ). Neither can it be the Spirit's finishing and completing the work of grace on the soul () for this was not yet done on the believers in Ephesus, nor the confirming of the Gospel and the believers in it, by the special effusion of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, or by his extraordinary works on the ministry of the word to establish it, and the faith of men in it, since these were not common to believers, whereas the believing Ephesians were sealed; while the Spirit of God still continues as a sealer of his people, as an earnest pledge of their inheritance until the day of redemption comes.John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible, - Ephesians 1:13 =Verse 14= :who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.

The verb is missing from the text, supplied by inference from verse 5 (\\"[he] made us alive\\").Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Ephesians 2, accessed 8 February 2018 Some translations decline to add a form of words on mankind being made alive: the New Revised Standard Version, for example, reads: :You were dead through the trespasses and sins in which you once lived.: NRSV =Verse 2= :... you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience.: NKJV The metaphor, \\"the prince of the power of the air\\" or \\"the ruler of the power of the air\\", is not used elsewhere in the New Testament. =Verse 3= : ...among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others. : NKJV The verse describes that before being saved, converts were just as bad as those outside the faith - that they gave in to their baser thoughts and impulses. There is debate about the phrase \\"children of wrath\\". Some indicate it refers to Original Sin, in which God was angered by Adam and Eve for disobeying him. Others believe it refers to the descendants of Cain, who slew Abel in his anger and brought murder into the world. =Verse 8= :For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, NKJV *\\"Gift of God\\": emphasizing that salvation is completely and solely a 'gift'. =Verse 9= : not of works, lest anyone should boast.

NKJV *\\"His workmanship\\": Not only as human beings, but also as Christians, new creatures; pertaining to the persons described in Ephesians 2:1-3 and include both Jews and Gentiles. *\\"Created in Christ Jesus for good works\\": the grace of God is an act of creation, that is, an infusion of new creatures, which are created in Christ. A person who has become a new creature, is visibly in Christ, ready to perform good works. *\\"God prepared beforehand\\" (KJV: \\"God has before ordained\\") or has \\"before prepared\\": the preparation of good works to be performed by believers, and the preparation of the believers for performihg the works, both are from the Lord. God has appointed good works to be done by his people, but the intention is not that they should be saved by them, but that they should walk in them; and this being God's pre-ordination, as it shows that predestination is not according to good works, since good works are the effects of it.John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible, Ephesians 2:10 The New Humanity (2:11‚Äì22) This is another review of the believers' transition from the past life to the \\"new humanity\\" (verse 15), from the perspective of the saving work of God through Israel which is now open to all through Christ. = Verses 11-12 = :11 Therefore remember that you, once Gentiles in the flesh‚Äîwho are called Uncircumcision by what is called the Circumcision made in the flesh by hands‚Äî 12 that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. =Verse 13= :But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. NKJV The image of the gentiles as being \\"far off\\" and \\"brought near\\" is also used in the Acts of the Apostles, where Peter speaks to the Pentecost crowds in Jerusalem saying: :The promise is to you (Jews) and to your children, and to all who are afar off. The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges notes that \\"nigh‚Äù and ‚Äúfar‚Äù were also familiar rabbinical terms in the sense of having or not having part in the covenant. \\"Johann Jakob Wettstein on this verse quotes, 'inter alia', the following from the Talmud: :‚ÄúA woman came to Rabbi Eliezer, to be made a proselyte; saying to him, 'Rabbi, make me nigh'.

Plot  In a police station, a blood-splattered woman named Catherine confesses to killing her husband's first wife earlier that day. Although she produces the murder weapon, Detective Fordham does not believe her, as the crime occurred three years earlier. Catherine explains the events that lead up to the crime. Three years prior to the murder, Catherine and Nick meet at a gallery. As Catherine leaves, a mugger attacks her. Nick comes to her aid and, when he notices that she is injured, invites her to stay overnight at his apartment while she recuperates from a twisted ankle. The two quickly fall in love and get married. A widower, Nick does not like to talk about his dead wife, Stella. Curious, Catherine questions their friends: Badge, an art broker and former girlfriend of Nick who lives in the loft below them; Charlie, a mathematician and video game programmer who lives below them; and Daisy, Charlie's on-and-off girlfriend. Catherine learns that an intruder murdered Stella three years ago after an apparent struggle. Due to Stella's mental instability, she and Nick had a rocky marriage. Eventually, Catherine comes to believe that someone has been sneaking into their apartment and vandalizing her possessions. However, the evidence always disappears before she can show it to Nick, who becomes concerned that she is suffering from the same delusions that affected Stella. When Catherine finds Stella's diary, she learns that Stella suspected Nick of infidelity. Jealous and enraged, Stella describes in her diary how she gets revenge on the suspected mistress by destroying her possessions, though the evidence always disappears before she can present it to Nick. When Catherine confides to Charlie that she thinks Stella may still be alive, Charlie says that he believes a wormhole may be allowing Stella, who lives in the past, to interact with Catherine in the present. Catherine investigates further, contacting Stella's twin sister and ex-husband. Both confirm that she was jealous of an unknown woman, whom Catherine comes to believe is herself. After Daisy and Charlie both die under suspicious circumstances, Catherine borrows Badge's pistol, a new model imported directly from Germany. Nick finally believes her once Stella's diary, which had gone missing, reappears and includes a new entry in which Stella threatens to murder Catherine by name. Nick and Catherine make preparations to stay at a hotel, and Nick leaves to meet her there. As Catherine packs, Stella attacks her with a pair of scissors. After a brief struggle, Catherine shoots and kills Stella in self-defense. Back in the police station, Catherine is booked and about to be given a psychiatric evaluation when she remembers that the murder weapon, Badge's pistol, can be easily traced. At her urging, the police discover that the pistol was manufactured after the crime took place. With no evidence and disbelieving her story of a wormhole, the police let her go with a warning not to further waste their time. From a distance, Stella jealously watches Nick and Catherine embrace.

Bailey later expressed frustration with the shoot and said that shooting in Montreal was the primary reason for the film's failure to be theatrically released.  Reception  Lisa Nesselson of Variety called it \\"a Gaslight for the '90s\\" that is more suited for television broadcast than theatrical distribution. Robert Pardi of TV Guide rated it 1/4 stars and wrote that the film's focus on suspense over characterization causes viewers to have nobody with whom they can identify when the plot becomes confusing. In an interview, Bailey said, \\"It's not a great film. It's just O.K. I've seen worse.\\"  References  External links  * * Category:1999 films Category:1990s psychological thriller films Category:British films Category:British psychological thriller films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian psychological thriller films Category:English-language films ","title":"The Intruder (1999 film)"},{"id":"45648108","text":"Xanil River, (), Saquilukun or downstream Agua Azul River () is an approximately 30 km long river in southeastern Mexico.

Raikhel is a distinguished professor of entomology at the University of California, Riverside, and an elected member of the United States National Academy of Sciences. Early life and education Raikhel grew up in Siberia in the Soviet Union. Raikhel was the son of two medical professionals, and was inspired by the books he read to become a scientist. He was fixated on the stereotypical image of intellectuals wearing glasses, and at one point deliberately failed a vision test so that he could wear glasses. Raikhel applied to Leningrad State University in 1965, but was delayed by the quota system due to his Jewish heritage. As a result, he cleaned pens at Leningrad Zoo and took night courses to further his education, eventually earning his master's degree in 1970. Again delayed by the quota system for Jews, Raikhel worked for Yu. S. Balashov at the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences during his studies; Raikhel defended his thesis about blood-feeding organisms in 1975. Career Raikhel's travels to study ticks in warmer climates influenced him and his wife, fellow Soviet scientist Natasha Raikhel, to look for a livelihood outside the USSR. With the help of visiting University of Georgia professor Jerry Paulin, the couple emigrated to the United States in 1979 as political refugees. Under Arden O. Lea at the University of Georgia, Raikhel switched from studying ticks to mosquitoes, which led him to study vector biology. Raikhel's work focused on identifying the chemical precursors to reproduction (vitellogenesis) in Drosophila, Aedes aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus. His lab discovered that the female mosquito, after having a blood meal, begins producing eggs. Raikhel began work at Michigan State University in 1986 as an associate professor of entomology where he received the university's Distinguished Faculty Award. While there, his work focused on the possibility of breeding mosquitoes to internally eliminate diseases they typically pass on to the animals they feed on. In January 2002, Raikhel moved from Michigan to the University of California, Riverside, in Southern California. That year, Raikhel was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and also awarded a MERIT award, a ten-year grant to continue his mosquito research by the National Institutes of Health. In 2009 Raikhel was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in recognition of his \\"groundbreaking contributions to understanding mosquito physiology\\". The same year he was named a fellow of the Entomological Society of America. Raikhel founded and currently leads UCR's Center for Disease Vector Research. Raikhel's recent research is on identifying how to manipulate the juvenile hormones of female mosquitos to impair their ability to reproduce healthy offspring, thus reducing vectors for yellow fever, dengue fever, and chikungunya.

He is the leader in career assists and points for the United Hockey League. Junior career Firth played Tier II junior hockey for the Ottawa Jr. Senators of the Central Junior Hockey League; in his single season for the team in 1988, he scored 126 points to lead the team. Drafted by the Kitchener Rangers of the Ontario Hockey League, he finished third in team scoring with 67 points in 1989, helping the Rangers to a first-place finish after several mediocre seasons. In 1990, he was again third in team scoring with 100 points. The Rangers lost in the league finals to the Oshawa Generals, and normally would not have gone on to play in the Memorial Cup tournament, but Cup host and OHL team Hamilton Dukes had the league's worst record and was replaced in the Memorial Cup by the Rangers. Firth scored 22 points in 17 playoff games as the Rangers surged to the Cup finals, eventually losing in double overtime in the final match to the Generals, 4-3. His performance led to him being awarded the George Parsons Trophy for sportsmanship in the Memorial Cup. Firth's third season in Kitchener saw him lead the team with 112 points, and finish sixth in league scoring, after which he was selected in the tenth round of the 1991 NHL Entry Draft by the Detroit Red Wings. He played his final junior season as an overager for the North Bay Centennials. Despite injuries that cost him 13 games, Firth finished second in team scoring with 97 points, and added 25 points in the playoffs as the Centennials reached the OHL Finals. Professional career Firth made his professional debut for the Red Wings' American Hockey League farm team, the Adirondack Red Wings, in the spring of 1992, playing two games without scoring. His junior success notwithstanding, the Red Wings declined to sign Firth to a contract for the 1993 season, and he signed as a free agent with the Ottawa Senators. He never played in Ottawa, instead playing in the mid- to low-minor leagues for over a decade thereafter. Firth retired after the 2005 season. He finished his professional career with 449 goals and 921 assists for 1370 points; as of 2015, he is the tenth leading scorer in minor league hockey history. In the United Hockey League, Firth scored 357 goals and 732 assists for 1089 points, the highest career totals ever recorded in the UHL for both assists and points.

Traditionally, it is believed to have been written by Apostle Paul while he was in prison in Rome (around AD 62), but more recently it has been suggested that it was written between AD 80 and 100 by another . This chapter is a part of long prayer of Paul (from Ephesians 1:3 to 3:21), with the particular section about Paul's stewardship of the great divine mystery, the petition for Christ to dwell in the believers' heart, and a doxology. Text The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 21 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 46 (~AD 200) *Codex Vaticanus (325-350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330-360) *Codex Alexandrinus (400-440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; complete) *Codex Freerianus (~450; extant verses 6-8, 18-20) *Codex Claromontanus (~550) Paul's Stewardship of the Great Mystery (3:1‚Äì13) The section starts with Paul's self- identification as \\"the prisoner of Christ Jesus\\", a position which he willingly endures \\"for the sake of the Gentiles\\" (verse 1), that is, for his converts' benefit. Many interpreters consider that this statement reflects both his relationship of being 'bound' to Christ,Meyer, H., Meyer's NT Commentary on Ephesians 3, accessed 10 July 2019 and also his being held in captivity (in Rome).Cambridge Bible for Schools and College on Ephesians 3, accessed 10 July 2019 Then, the main focus is the divine mystery that Paul is commissioned to unveil. It is the mystery of Christ as God's grace for all. =Verse 3‚Äì4= : how that by revelation He made known to me the mystery (as I have briefly written already, by which, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ),: NKJV =Verse 5= :which [mystery] in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets.: NKJV *\\"In other ages\\", or \\"to people in other generations\\";: NIV there are two main Greek readings: ::in the Textus Receptus, , (ho en heterais geneais);: Textus Receptus ::in critical Greek texts, the ·ºêŒΩ does not appear.: SBL Greek New Testament Heinrich Meyer argues that the ·ºêŒΩ has been added \\"against decisive testimony\\" among early texts. The meaning may be \\"at earlier times\\" or \\"to previous generations\\". =Verse 9= : and to make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the ages has been hidden in God who created all things through Jesus Christ; NKJV Resuming Prayer (3:14‚Äì21) The object of the long prayer is God alone, \\"experienced and approached as Father\\" (verse 14), to whom Paul petitions for the strengthening of the believers' condition. Paul's prayer is for Christ to dwell in the hearts of believers as the sign of 'genuine' conversion of faith. The prayer is closed by a benediction, ascribing glory to God. =Verse 16= :that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, NKJV * \\"According to the riches of his glory\\": that is, according to the abundant completeness of grace in Christ Jesus. * \\"To be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man\\": is Paul's petition to the Father of Christ, that he would enable the believers to be strong during the tribulations, give the needed fresh supplies of power to perform duties of grace, to resist Satan and its temptations, to oppose corruptions, and to bear the cross, holding on and out to the end. This is a gift of God's free grace; a \\"grant\\" in form of \\"his Spirit\\", who strengthens them by guiding them to the fullness of grace in Christ, by placing the love of God in their hearts, applying the promises of the Gospel to them, and making the Gospel itself useful to give them strength. * \\"The inner man\\": or soul of man, as the subject of the blessing, which is \\"the seat of grace\\". This last phrase is joined to the beginning of the next verse in the Arabic, Syriac and Ethiopian versions, \\"in the inner man Christ may dwell\\".John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible, - Ephesians 3:16 See also * Holy Spirit * Jesus Christ * Knowledge of Christ * Related Bible parts: Romans 8, 2 Corinthians 1, Ephesians 1 ReferencesBibliography * External links * King James Bible - Wikisource *English Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate *Online Bible at GospelHall.org (ESV, KJV, Darby, American Standard Version, Bible in Basic English) *Multiple bible versions at Bible Gateway (NKJV, NIV, NRSV etc.) 03 ","title":"Ephesians 3"},{"id":"45648170","text":"Ahmet √úst√ºnta≈ü (born 27 January 1990) is a Turkish biathlete.

It is located on 57th Street and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, two blocks south of Central Park. Prior to its 2013 reopening, the Quin was originally the Buckingham Hotel, a Beaux-Arts style building designed by American architect, Emery Roth, which opened in 1929. The Quin opened on November 11, 2013 with an architectural redesign by New York, New York based firm Perkins Eastman. It has 208 guestrooms including 28 suites.  Famous Residents  Former guests include Georgia O‚ÄôKeeffe, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, and Marc Chagall.  Quin Arts  The Quin Arts program presents events, exhibitions, salons, lectures, film premieres, book debuts, musical performances and artist receptions. Some highlights of the program include a 15-foot abstract video art wall and a permanent collection featuring artists from around the world, including Blek le Rat, Patrick Graham, Nick Walker, and Eric Zener. The Quin Arts Program also features a contemporary artist-in-residence program under the direction of curator DK Johnston. Under the program, artists stay and work at the hotel, enabling guests to interact with them and gain insight that goes beyond what a visit to museum or gallery can impart. The program has mostly included street artists who have drawn and painted on hotel doors, stairwells, and other areas, in addition to exhibiting work in the lobby. Blek le Rat, who was in residence in 2014, was mistakenly nearly arrested after police saw him stenciling on a hotel door. The summer 2016 artist in residence was Berlin-based street artist Tavar Zawacki aka Above (artist). In September 2016, the Quin commissioned Chaz Barrisson, half of the street art duo London Police, to paint two of his signature grinning characters on the wall by the service doors of the hotel. The London Police residency included a gallery show of their graphic, black-and-white work, done on canvas and paper. Johnston reports that guests have started to plan trips around artists‚Äô residencies. In June 2014, the Quin hotel was shortlisted for the ‚ÄúMost Creative Collaboration‚Äù Award at LE Miami travel trade show for its arts program. In November 2016, the Quin commissioned 14 acclaimed artists to create custom pieces for a group salon in partnership with D'Angelico Guitars. Artists included Above (Tavar Zawacki), Alex Yanes, ASVP, Blek le Rat, Eric Zener, Joanne CORNO, Amanda Marie, Mindy Linkous, Nick Walker, Pure Evil, Robert Malmberg, SP38, The London Police, and Wulf Treu. Robert Malmberg contributed to the program again in February 2017 with a second solo Quin Arts exhibition entitled, Light Waves. Light Waves highlights two diverse expressions of Malmberg‚Äôs work and features a color saturated Neon Landscapes series, along with a black and white presentation of oversized contact sheets exploring Manhattan. Malmberg is an award-winning photographer and filmmaker from Louisville, Kentucky. A pioneer in the revival of wet collodion photography, Malmberg capitalizes on wet-plate, slow exposure techniques to produce ultra-detailed and hauntingly nostalgic images. The meticulous process riffs off the imperfection and beauty of 19th century portrait photography. In August 2014, Malmberg was commissioned by the New York Historical Society Museum & Library to reimagine Antebellum era photography with \\"Camp History: Civil War Photography,\\" a workshop for NYC youth. His inaugural exhibition at the Quin, INcognito, debuted March 5, 2015. Dutch photographer Anne Barlinckhoff‚Äôs solo exhibition Strength Africa debuted at the Quin in the spring of 2017 and featured works captured during her travels through West Africa. Barlinckhoff‚Äôs inspiration was driven ‚Äúby love, life and loss and all those moments in between.‚Äù Portraits embodied the strength and vulnerability of her female subjects amid Africa‚Äôs vibrant landscape. In June 2017, American photojournalist Hilary Swift presented her first solo exhibition Time In- Between‚Äîa collection of intimate and surprising portraits documenting everyday life in New York City. Swift covers politics, social issues, and breaking news, and is a frequent contributor to The New York Times. The Quin then showcased two exhibitions by Danish photographer S√∏ren Solk√¶r. SURFACE‚Äîthe first collection of its kind to be exhibited within a luxury suite‚Äîcaptured some of the world‚Äôs most famous street artists at work over a three-year journey around the globe and was installed in the Quin Penthouse. These portraits were taken from his fine art photography book of the same name, first published in 2015. A reissue featuring new photography is slated for early 2018. HEART BEAT CITY consisted of select photographs from SURFACE and new New York-centric images commissioned for the Quin. It debuted in the hotel's lobby August 17, 2017. In October 2017, the Quin showcased works from photographer Andy Freeberg's published series: Sentry, Guardians, and Art Fare. In this collection, Freeberg, who is perhaps best known for his portraits, captures life inside a museum. Freeberg turns his lens to the dealers, artists, art enthusiasts, and museum guards in galleries to explore their interplay with the works of art themselves. The prolific artist has been featured in public and private museum collections, international solo shows from California to Russia to Mexico City, and publications including Rolling Stone, Le Monde, The Guardian, and The New Yorker. The Quin‚Äôs year-long photography series culminated with photographer Bo Bridges‚Äôs exhibition Fear the Life Unlived in November 2017. This adrenaline-boosting collection captured Bridges‚Äôs intrepid spirit, showcasing his adventures chasing the surf and the highest altitudes in Tahiti, Hawaii, Mexico's Guadalupe Islands, the Grand Tetons, and Southern California. As an acclaimed commercial and versatile fine arts photographer, his portfolio includes portraits of celebrities and athletes, film and television campaigns, as well as nature, sports, and travel photography. Through stunning imagery, Fear the Life Unlived demonstrated what ‚Äúthe pursuit of the rush‚Äù looks like. The Quin featured an exhibition from seven the New York Academy of Art alumni, co- curated by Heidi Elbers and DK Johnston in spring 2018. Selections from esteemed graduates Tamalin Baumgarten, Shauna Finn, Alexis Hilliard, Gianna Putrino, James Razko, Nicolas V. Sanchez, and Gabriel Zea were on view in the Quin lobby. From printmaking to complex collages, the breadth of the exhibition displayed the artists‚Äô collection of distinct styles and influences that parallel the multiplicity of New York City. Together, these artists brought an ‚Äúimpressive range of techniques, viewpoints, and experiences‚Äù that allowed the alumni to not only to interact with visitors and the local community, but to showcase the talents of the Academy. The Quin and the New York Academy of Art have an extended history of collaboration, most notably, ‚ÄúBlek le Rat: Escaping Paris.‚Äù This series included 25 unique monotypes with lithography created by Blek le Rat at the Academy and was presented at the Quin in 2014. On April 12, 2018, DK Johnston and Getty Image Gallery celebrated late photographer Slim Aarons. Over 20 works from the Getty Image archive were on display at Quin‚Äôs triplex Penthouse Suite and selected public spaces through the close of 2018. A decorated soldier turned high-flying photographer, Aarons left US Army‚Äôs Yank Magazine to shoot for Life in Rome. He traded war for the ‚Äúsun-dazed glamour and frivolity‚Äù of jet-setters and celebrities and photographed the ‚Äústunning palazzos, private villas and wealthy estates‚Äù of the dolce vita lifestyle. In his time, he worked for a myriad of fashion and leisure publications including Holiday, Town and Country, Vanity Fair, Vogue, Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, Travel & Leisure and Life. Aarons captured the ‚Äúcult of the celebrity‚Äù with a roster of star subjects, including Truman Capote, Marilyn Monroe, Louis Armstrong, and President Kennedy. Aarons ‚Äúlived by a simple mantra: concentrate on photographing attractive people doing attractive things in attractive places.‚Äù On May 10, 2018, the Quin debuted a vibrant collection of floral-themed pieces to celebrate spring in the city. Co-curated by DK Johnston and New York-based curator Lori Zimmer, In BLOOM highlighted the signature styles of 29 participating artists. Artists included Alexis Hilliard, Annika Connor, ASVP, Beau Stanton, C215, CRASH (John Matos), Elizabeth Winnel, Ellannah Sadkin, Erik Foss, Galo, Icy & Sot, Jamie Martinez, Jeremy John Kaplan, Joanne Leah, Jon Burgerman, Kathryn Rose, Keya Tama, Logan Hicks, Mando Marie, Michael DeFeo, Mindy Linkous, Nick Walker, Pure Evil (Charley Uzzell Edwards), Robert Malmberg, Ron English, Sean Augustine March, Vahge, and Wulf Von Treu. The lobby‚Äôs 15 foot video wall showcased Brooklyn-based artist Ashley G. Garner‚Äôs Synaesthesia series, which featured six films on loop and six separate hues influenced by color psychology. The six-part video series was paired with audio compositions by musician ALURIA. The Quin‚Äôs latest exhibition, And Suddenly the Picture was Distorted launched July 12, 2018. Inspired by a lyric from ‚ÄúThe Hall of Mirrors‚Äù by legendary German electronic group Kraftwerk, this exciting exhibit explored the themes of image, obsession, and perception through a variety of mediums and techniques. Co-curated by DK Johnston and Angelo Madgridale in partnership with Doyle, selections included private collections and new work from Swoon, ROA, WK Interact, Nick Walker, John Fekner, Michael de Feo, and Blek le Rat. A special installation on the 15-foot video wall featured the photography of Soren Solkaer. The exhibition also included site-specific work created at the Quin itself, such as a steel door tagged as ‚ÄúAndy Warhol‚Äù by renowned graffiti artist and former Artist in Residence Blek le Rat. As the Quin Arts Program approached its 5th Anniversary, And Suddenly the Picture was Distorted celebrated its run of thought-provoking and visually compelling exhibitions, ranging from international graffiti art, to photography, photo-realism, and collage.

They were organized into groups, which were effective decision-making centers for most activities. Representatives of all groups met from time to time at the district level. At the village level, these activists moved to establish various structures that included volunteer squads, and to some extent, committees chosen or elected by the villagers themselves. This village structure developed only with the movement itself in late 1944 and 1945. Babuji and Indumati Patankar established the Kasegaon Education Society and the first High School in Kasegaon called Azad Vidyalaya. He received his MD degree in Gynecology. He has been a full-time activist since 1973. He has participated in numerous movements since then and has led many struggles from urban textile workers to rural farmers and laborers fighting for equal water and land rights. He had been a close associate of Dalit Panther activists in early period as part of the then-existing Magowa group. In the second phase of Dalit Panthers he was closely connected to Arun Kamble etc. He practices Navayana Buddhism. Activism Bharat Patankar is one of the architects of equitable water distribution movement in Maharashtra. Presumably, he was one of the rare contributors doing a synthesis of Marx, Phule, Ambedkar, Gramsci, etc. in a new theoretical perspective. He was also one of the rare contributors interpreting the existing contemporary caste system at a theoretical level. He was part of a street play group, the collective writer of the plays, a songwriter, and a performer in Samagra Sadak Natak Calwal. He was one of the founding members of Krantiba Phule Sanskritic Manch in Mumbai during the late 1970s. He is a leading activist in the Badwe Hatao movement of Vidrohi Sanskritic Calval and is still leading the movement of Vithoba- Rakhumai Mukti Andolan for deleting recitation of \\"purush sukta\\" from the Pandharpur Mandir rites provided for in the Mandir Act.

Etymology and history of the surname  Poleon came to England with the ancestors of the Poleon family in the Norman Conquest of 1066AD. It comes from the Norman-Christian given name Paulinus, which belonged to an early Anglo- Norman settler. First found in Staffordshire from very ancient times, and Lincolnshire where they were Lords of the Manor of Odcombe. The origin of the name has long since faded over time but most scholars give the name as a Norman Christian name belonging to a settler, Paulinus, who landed in England soon after the Norman Conquest. It is often believed that the name originated from France because of its close relation to the name Napoleon but this is not the case. The name Poleon is seen globally. It is most popular in Europe but is also seen in Australia, America, Canada, China and India.  Famous persons with the Poleon surname  Dominic Poleon (British Footballer.)

The character and the series, a sequel to Avatar: The Last Airbender, were created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. Lin's mother, Toph Beifong, greatly aided the previous avatar, Aang, in his efforts to save the Earth Kingdom from destruction. Lin is the older of Toph's two daughters. Character overview Lin Beifong is the Chief of Police of Republic City and the daughter of Toph Beifong, who once held the same position. Like her mother, Lin is able to both manipulate the classical element of earth, which is known as earthbending and its sub-ability to manipulate metal, which is termed metalbending. Like Toph, Lin also has the ability to sense movements around her through mechanoreception. She learned these techniques under the hard tutelage of her mother. Despite the fact that her mother was friends with the previous Avatar, Lin initially was decidedly antagonistic towards Avatar Korra, at one time interrogating the lead character. However, throughout the course of the series‚Äô run she warmed up to Korra. Lin has a longstanding friendship with Tenzin, who is a son of Aang and Katara. At one point the two characters were romantically involved. Tenzin offered Lin comfort and a higher level of trust was reached between the two. However, their romantic relationship ended, partially because Tenzin wanted children while Lin did not and partially because of Lin's abrasive nature. Tenzin ultimately married, while Lin remained unmarried. Much like her mother, Lin's personality is described as tough, uncompromising and blunt. Unlike Toph however, Lin can also be characterized as bitter, which primarily stemmed from her strained relationship with both her mother and her half-sister, Suyin Beifong. In the latter half of the series run, Lin reconciled with the two characters, becoming less resentful as the series progressed.  Creation and conception  Mindy Sterling voices Lin Beifong. While her mother was known during announcements for the series and established at the start of the series, the identity of her father was not revealed initially. Lin Beifong's character design was inspired by Han Young Ja, a longtime friend and colleague of Konietzko and DiMartino. Elements of her design also came from Marlene Dietrich as the creators wanted her \\"to have a tough and natural beauty\\" and her appearance was collaborated on by both Joaquim Dos Santos and series co- creator Michael DiMartino which DiMartino found to be \\"a fun process.\\"  Appearances The Legend of Korra=Book One: Air Lin spent the vast majority of Season One in Republic City. When Lin first met Korra, she made it clear that she held no favors for Korra. She interrogated the Avatar and when Tenzin arrived, Lin agreed to drop the charges against Korra, though made it clear that she wanted the Avatar \\"out of [her] city\\". Lin initially held a grudge against Tenzin over their breakup several years earlier, but agreed to ‚Äúbury the hatchet‚Äù in their effort to secure a sporting event from a terrorist group, the Equalists. Despite maximum-level security, the Equalists were able to disrupt the event, overwhelming the police forces. Lin, with the help of Korra, was able to repel the terrorist group, though they were unable to capture the organization's leader, Amon. Korra had earned Lin's respect and trust in the process. After the Equalist attack, Lin received negative press for failing to capture Amon. Lin would lead an investigation that uncovered that industrialist Hiroshi Sato, Asami Sato's father, involvement with the Equalists. In an ensuing battle pitting Lin, Korra, Tenzin and members of the police force against the terrorist organization, a number of police officers were captured by the Equalists. The trio was able to avoid capture, but Lin elected to tender her resignation. When Tenzin encouraged her to not give up, Lin shared that she intended to capture Amon ‚Äúoutside of the law‚Äù. Later, with Tenzin needing to attend a council meeting, Lin watched over Tenzin's wife and children on Air Temple Island. Shortly, the Equalists invaded the island, incapacitating Lin in the process. Ironically, Lin was rescued by three of Tenzin's kids, Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo, who easily defeated the invaders. Upon Tenzin's return to the island, noticing that more Equalist airships were heading to Republic City Tenzin decided to take his family and flee Republic City on Tenzin's sky bison, Oogi. Lin accompanied the family. However, when it became apparent that Oogi would not outpace the airships, Lin made the decision to abandon Oogi and attack the fleet in midair in an effort to ensure the family's escape. In an impressive display of midair metalbending, Lin single-handedly destroyed a number of airships before she was captured by the terrorist organization, allowing Tenzin and his family to at least temporarily escape capture. Lin would lose her bending at the hands of Amon, who had the ability to take away bending, but would have it later restored by Korra. Book Two: Spirits In Season Two, Lin returned to Republic City, reinstated as Chief of Police. Impressed by Mako's outstanding work in busting local gangs, Lin hired Mako as an officer. Six months later, Lin and the Republic City Police force would investigate the bombing of the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center. When Korra and Mako initially broke up (over issues related to the bombing) at the city police station, Lin, finding an overturned table, demanded to know what happened. Mako stated that he had broken up with the Avatar. Amused, she commented that he got off easy compared to her break up with Tenzin. A few days later, Lin traveled to Mako's apartment to investigate incriminating evidence in connection with the bombing of the cultural center. Mako adamantly denied any involvement in the bombing. However, when money and explosives were found in the apartment, she had Mako arrested. Lin and her fellow officers later provided security at the pro- bending arena during the premiere screening of a film starring Bolin. When Varrick, who bankrolled the motion picture, was outed as the mastermind of not only the attempted kidnapping of President Raiko at the event, but also the bombing of the cultural center, Lin promptly arrested him and freed Mako. Lin promoted Mako to detective, noting that the officer was the first to suspect Varrick behind the bombings. Book Three: Change In Season Three, Lin spent a significant amount of time outside Republic City. After helping Korra free captive airbenders in the Earth Kingdom capital of Ba Sing Se, Lin would join Team Avatar (Korra, Asami, Bolin and Mako) in searching for one more reported airbender in the Earth Kingdom city of Zaofu. When Lin arrived in Zaofu, she elected to stay on the ship instructing Team Avatar to not reveal her presence. However Lin's presence was detected and Suyin, matriarch of Zaofu, met Lin on the ship. Suyin revealed to Team Avatar that she was Lin's sister, upon which Lin reminded her that she was her half-sister. Suyin shared that Lin's niece, Opal, was the airbender. At an ensuing dinner, Lin made a number of snide remarks to many of Suyin statements. Before the argument escalated they were interrupted by Varrick, who was out of prison and resided in Zaofu. Later that night, Opal and Korra visited Lin in her room. In an attempt to reconcile the two sisters, Opal shared with Lin that she wanted her to be a part of the family. Lin responded with a cold \\"get out\\". Opal ran out of the room in tears. In response to Lin's behavior, Korra angrily told Lin that the police chief would always be a lonely and bitter woman before storming out of the room. Lin cried in her room alone. The next morning, Lin took up Suyin's trusted advisor Aiwei advice to visit the city's acupuncturist to deal with her stress. During the ensuing sessions, which involved reaching into her buried memories, she revisited her checkered past with Suyin. Lin flashed back to her attempt to arrest Suyin and her subsequent scarring accidentally caused by Suyin. Upon awakening from her final session, she disregarded the doctor's suggestion to rest, deciding instead to confront Suyin. An enraged Lin started yet another argument with Suyin. The argument quickly escalated and when Suyin told Lin that she was a bitter, selfish woman and that Tenzin was right to leave her, Lin attacked, setting off a full-blown fracas between the siblings. When an angry Opal finally broke up the fight, demanding to know why two sisters would want to hurt each other, Lin passed out from exhaustion, sleeping for the next sixteen hours. Upon waking up, Lin was well-rested and was in a substantially more positive mood. She apologized to Opal for her behavior, explaining she was not comfortable speaking about personal matters. She advised Opal to train with the other airbenders away from home, which Opal ultimately did. Lin also reconciled with Suyin. Later, Lin would be involved in a large-scale clash with the Red Lotus, an anarchist group. During the battle she and Suyin fought P'Li, a formidable foe and combustion-bender. P‚Äôli had the rare ability to generate fire from her forehead, causing explosions. Lin relayed to her sister that when she drew P'Li's fire, Suyin was to incapacitate her. Suyin objected, but Lin told her sibling she loved her before unilaterally initiating the plan. The police chief was hit by a blast from P‚ÄôLi, nearly falling over a cliff. In one of the series‚Äô more graphic moments, as P‚ÄôLi was preparing to knock Lin off the cliff with a blast, Suyin quickly metalbent her plate of armor around the combustion bender's head. This caused P'Li's explosion to blow up in her face, instantly killing her. While the fatal explosion was not shown on-screen, P‚ÄôLi's demise was apparent. Book Four: Balance In Season Four, set three years after the conclusion of Season Three, Lin would spend the majority of her time at Republic City. However, she did make one excursion outside the city, to save Suyin and many members of her family, who were imprisoned by the Earth Kingdom dictator, Kuvira. When the world leaders decided to not attack Kuvira, Lin immediately sought out Opal. Eventually the two allowed Bolin to join their mission, flying on Opal's sky bison, Juicy. Once the trio arrived at Zaofu, they encountered Toph, whom Lin addressed as \\"chief\\". After Bolin, through his stint as a soldier of Kuvira's army, was able to inform them the location of the nearest ‚Äúreeducation camp‚Äù, the quartet left for the camp on Juicy. During dinner, Lin made a number of sarcastic comments towards her mother. When Bolin asked Toph who Lin's father was, her mother casually answered that it was a man named Kanto, who she characterized as a ‚Äúnice man‚Äù. Sensing her daughter's \\"enraged breathing\\" Toph told Lin to say whatever was on her mind. Lin angrily replied that growing up without a father and never seeing or even discussing him was unacceptable to her. Lin declared that after the rescue, she wanted nothing to do with her mother. Toph solemnly stated that if that made Lin happy, she would accept her decision. The four would eventually successfully free Suyin and all the incarcerated members of her family. They would also rescue Varrick's longtime assistant Zhu Li. Lin and her mother would eventually reconcile with the latter stating that she was proud of both her and Suyin. Subsequently, Zhu Li informed Lin that Kuvira planned to invade Republic City in two weeks. Lin played a large role in the battle of Republic City. She along with Korra, Mako, Bolin, Tenzin, Bumi, Jinora, Ikki, Meelo, Opal and other airbenders battled a 25-story mecha suit, operated by Kuvira. She was part of the incursion team that successfully entered Kuvira's machine. Once inside, Lin and Suyin inflicted major damage. They rendered the suit's primary weapon, a large cannon mounted on its right arm, useless. When Kuvira ripped the now functionless arm off and violently tossed it away, Lin and Suyin were trapped in the appendage. The two were knocked unconscious by the resulting impact with the ground but would later regain consciousness. When Kuvira finally surrendered, Lin arrested the despot and led her away. Shortly after she and many others attended the wedding and reception party of Varrick and Zhu Li, Lin smiling as the newlyweds kissed. = Graphic novel trilogy = In part one, Lin is focused on taking down the triads with her triads task force. Lin, along with her task force, break up a fight between the Triple Threats and the Creeping Crystals. Two-Toed Ping is arrested and Lin and Mako then interrogate him and are able to find out the name of the new Triple Threats leader, Tokuga. AbilitiesHeightened senses= By grounding herself barefoot, Lin can \\"see\\" and \\"feel\\" even the most minute seismic vibrations in the earth, be it the presence of trees or the march of ants several meters away.

San Diego Comicon 2006 panel question and answer part 2 - Avatarspirit.nethttp://www.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=1038 The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting style. Earthbending represents the element of substance,Ehasz, Aaron (writer) & Spaulding, Ethan (director). (June 2, 2006). \\"Bitter Work\\". Avatar: The Last Airbender. Season 2. Episode 9. Nickelodeon. and is categorized as the most diverse and enduring of the \\"four bending arts\\". Earthbending is the geokinetic ability to manipulate earth, rock, sand, lava, and metals in all their various forms. Earthbending utilizes neutral jing, which involves waiting and listening for the right moment to act decisively. Earthbending involves enduring attacks until the right opportunity to counterattack reveals itself, emphasizes \\"heavily rooted stances and strong blows that evoke the mass and power of earth\\", and demands precise stepping footwork to maintain constant contact with the ground. Earthbending parallels Five Animals movements. Earthbending is at its strongest when the feet or hand are in direct contact with the ground, enabling earthbenders to transfer their kinetic energies into their bending for fast and powerful moves. This reliance on direct contact with the earth is a literal Achilles' heel; separating earthbenders from any contact with the earth renders them ineffective.  Reception  Reviewer David Levesley called Lin one of the series' \\"standout characters\\" and one of the show's \\"many examples of well-written women\\". Reviewer Alyssia Rosenberg thought Lin was a \\"real standout\\" of the first season for her character arc, feeling it embodied a \\"small trend\\" of \\"female action stars\\" sacrificing themselves. She compared the scene where Lin lost her bending abilities to Amon to that of a scene in the film Sucker-Punch and praised the soundtrack for being \\"a powerful representation of the sudden absence that has made Lin much of who she is.\\" Robert Kuang felt that out of the major characters, Lin remained \\"the most intriguing\\", which Kuang attributed to her limited screentime and parentage. Before the reveal of Kanto, the character's father was a source of great intrigue for a number of fans of the show. A few theorized that Sokka or perhaps Amon was the character's father. Reviewer Michael Mammano viewed Lin's outburst at her mother during the fourth season as being \\"emotional\\" and akin to that of an angry child. Reviewer, Oliver Sava praised the depiction of the \\"icy\\" relationship between the character and her mother, noting that it better explained how Lin became \\"the rigid, chilly person she is today.\\" TV.com felt Lin was similar to Varrick, a character introduced later in the show's run, for starting out on \\"one-note\\" but later becoming \\"layered\\" and wrote that it made sense that Lin would 'finally patch things up with\\" Toph after ending her estrangement with her sister Suyin. However, the character and her arc did draw some measure of criticism from media and fans. Reviewer Gina Luttrell characterized Lin as \\"psychotic\\" for relating to Korra after the latter violently expressed her outrage with Mako during their initial break-up. Additionally, the mother-daughter reunion between Lin and Toph was characterized as \\"rushed\\" by reviewer Joey Sack. Sack suggested that the creators needed another episode to fully \\"flesh out\\" the conflict between the longstanding two characters. Zach Blumenfeld of Paste felt that Lin did not bring something new to the \\"tough cop\\" archetype, but commended her story arc for \\"beautifully\\" portraying the loneliness that a career woman can face. Overall, Blumenfeld ranked Lin as the 14th best character from the Avatar franchise.

Background After graduating from Monclova High School in 1949, Van Gundy attended Bowling Green State University on an Edwin Mosley scholarship. While an undergraduate, Van Gundy worked part-time at an H.J. Heinz research facility. There he met J.C. Walker: a professor teaching at University of Wisconsin-Madison. Walker offered Van Gundy an assistantship to continue studying cucumbers after Van Gundy's graduation from Bowling Green State University. Van Gundy went to University of Wisconsin for graduate work, where he completed his Ph.D. in 1956 and his postdoctoral studies in February 1957. Van Gundy interviewed with Dewey J. Raski for a nematology position at University of California, Riverside (UCR); Van Gundy was hired by the co-located University of California Citrus Experiment Station as a junior nematologist in March 1957. In 1966 Van Gundy took a sabbatical from teaching to study Meloidogyne javanica and Tylenchulus semipenetrans in Australia with Harry Wallace and Alan Bird. Van Gundy was promoted to full professor in July 1968. In 1969 during the height of the Vietnam War, Van Gundy defended the University‚Äôs position refusing classified Department of Defense research projects, citing the restriction against publication counter to the interests of involved graduate and postdoctoral students. That same year Van Gundy founded the Journal of Nematology for the Society of Nematologists, becoming the journal's first editor-in-chief. Beginning in 1970 Van Gundy served as Assistant Vice Chancellor for Research until 1972 when he was recruited by the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources's dean, William Dugger, to chair the department of nematology. In 1978, Van Gundy was named a fellow of the American Phytopathological Society. Van Gundy continued to chair nematology at UCR until he took a sabbatical in 1984 to study rhizobacteria. That work resulted in Van Fundy being awarded a patent for Rhizobacterial plant protection. Upon his return he was appointed Associate Dean of Research. Van Gundy was appointed interim dean of the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources in 1988 and became full dean in 1990. He retired in 1993. Even after retirement he continued to teach courses in growing blueberries and plumerias. Van Gundy was appointed by Governor Gray Davis to the Regional Water Quality Control Board for the Santa Ana region in 2000 and re-appointed by Davis's successor, Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006. In 2006 Van Gundy was inducted by Moldova's National Academy of Sciences in thanks of his management of the extension program between UCR and Moldova State University.

The hybrizyme phenomenon is widespread and these alleles occur commonly, if not in all hybrid zones. Initially considered to be caused by elevated rates of mutation in hybrids, the most probable hypothesis infers that they are the result of negative (purifying) selection. Namely, in the center of the hybrid zone, negative selection purges alleles against hybrid disadvantage (e.g. hybrid inviability or infertility). Stated differently, any allele that will decrease reproductive isolation is favored and any linked alleles (genetic markers) also increase their frequency by genetic hitchhiking. If the linked alleles used to be rare variants in the parental taxa, they will become more common in the area where the hybrids are formed.  Origin of the term  Originally hybrizymes were defined as ‚Äúunexpected allelic electromorphs associated with hybrid zones‚Äù, a formal term proposed by renowned conservation geneticist and biogeographer David S. Woodruff in 1988. By suggesting a new definition for a phenomenon that had been previously widely observed Woodruff‚Äôs interpretation bypasses the etiological connotation of alternative terms and avoids inappropriate context. Namely, previous studies referred to allozymes that were observed at high frequency in hybrid zones, but are absent or rare in parental taxa as ‚Äúthe rare allele phenomenon‚Äù. These alleles can have increased frequencies up to a point of the allele becoming the most common one in the hybrid zone, rendering the term ‚Äúthe rare allele phenomenon‚Äù deceptive. Despite this, these two terms have been used interchangeably in literature.  Widespread phenomenon  Hybrid populations display the hybrizyme phenomenon by having increased frequencies of certain alleles that are rare or non-existent outside of the hybrid zone. The hybrizyme phenomenon is widespread in hybrid zones of species of snails, crickets, lizards, salamanders, rodents, fish and birds. Intriguingly, the increased frequency of some of these alleles can have a pronounced effect making them 3-20 times more common in hybrids than in non-hybrid populations. Early studies focused on detecting electromorphs for loci that code regulatory and non-regulatory enzymes from several functional classes using allozyme electrophoresis and usually involved loci that were polymorphic in parental populations. The phenomenon has also been detected in a broad range of genetic markers such as intron haplotypes, microsatellites, ribosomal DNA spacer variants, and anonymous SNPs.  Mutational origin  Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mutational (molecular) origin of hybrizymes. They include gene conversion, transposable element activity, post-translational modification, mutations. and intragenic recombination. Some of these hypotheses are rejected by research in the past couple of years, but there is an unambigious explanation for the mutational origin of hybrizymes. The two hypotheses most often discussed are increased mutation rates and intragenic recombination. = Mutation = Under the mutational hypothesis, hybrizymes likely arise due to simple point mutations. Sequencing data have indicated this and imply low likelihood that hybrizymes arise as a result of transposition or recombination. Research on pocket gophers and Japanese freshwater crabs confirms that the phenomenon is possibly caused by simple nucleotide substitutions. However, the hypothesis has several weaknesses. It does not explain why normally rare alleles are restricted to a hybrid zone, why polymorphic loci are affected more or offers a mechanism that explains the high frequency of even the rarest variants. = Intragenic recombination = Intragenic recombination, under certain circumstances, might create new allelic variants at rates higher than the ones associated with regular mutational processes. Under this hypothesis the variant allele would be a mosaic of the parental alleles. The likelihood of this hypothesis was disputed, through sequencing studies.Although there is yet no specific explanation for hybrizymes, it is not excluded that hybrizymes are generated by the combined effect of recombination and mutation events, with any recombination trace concealed by succeeding mutations. However, research on Acer species implies that high recombination rates are possible due to acceleration of genetic variation after hybridization. Furthermore, results are found that indicate that recurrent mutation is unlikely and that support the hypothesis of recombination.  Cause of maintenance  Several hypotheses have been proposed to account the high frequency of hybrizymes in hybrid zones such as genetic drift, elevated rates of nucleotide substitutions. or positive selection on alleles which are mildly deleterious in parental taxa. Still, some faced a certain degree of unpredictability; specifically under the mutational hypothesis the overall substitution rates are elevated and many variants are expected versus having only one allele reaching high frequency and, at the same time, positive selection on deleterious alleles seems ambiguous. Selection does not need to be directed to the hybrizime, but to other genes with which the hybrizyme is linked, placing genetic hitchhiking in perspective. In other words, hybrid zones are maintained primarily by balance between gene flow and hybrid inferiority. In the centre of hybrid zones, the process of constant creation of low-fitness recombinant genotypes will favor any allele that will decrease reproductive isolation, consequently elevating the hybrid fitness. So, a likely mechanism would be negative or purifying selection against poorly fit multilocus genotypes. Therefore, the hybrizymes that increase in frequency could be modifier alleles or genetic markers that increase via hitchhiking. It is not excluded that the targets of selection are the barrier loci, loci that resist homogenization with the other genome during gene flow among diverging species, making them the most different parts of the genome between divergent populations. If allelic variation at these loci is considered, there might be alleles that have differential effect on reproductive isolation or hybrid disadvantage, leading to selection of those who have lower severity. The exact origin and mechanism that maintains these alleles at a high frequency is still a subject of debate and additional studies, such as Next Generation Sequencing analysis of the genomic regions involved in the phenomenon as a more trustworthy pathway to identify genes that impact the level of reproductive isolation.  Adaptive novelty  Hybridization might expand the prospect of adaptive radiation to the point where positive selection on recombinant hybrid genotypes surpasses the intrinsic selection against them. Therefore, the selection schemes in hybrid swarms ensures that relatively strong endogenous selection would not quench such potential. Additionally, partial postzygotic reproductive isolation usually involves multiple genes and segregation and recombination of genes creates broadly varying reproductive compatibility in hybrid populations. Consequently, there will be recurrent removal of disadvantageous alleles for reproductive isolation and relative stabilization of hybrid zones, possibly slowing down the path of complete speciation by reinforcement. With the continual selection against hybrid disadvantage, crossing-over might, over time, interrupt existing linkages and establish new. This generates a shift in selection pressure on loci which are in linkage with these genes and will contribute to further changes in allele frequencies on a genome scale. The ‚Äúrare allele phenomenon‚Äù might be an indication of this process. Even with the continuous effect of relatively strong endogenous selection against hybrids, a hybrid population might be an example where selection against reproductive isolation results in creating variable recombinant genotypes. Sometimes, this phenomenon might assist in creating a complex of adaptive traits that lead to adaptive novelty.

This chapter is a part of Paul's exhortation (Ephesians 4‚Äì6), with the particular section about the mutual interdependence of the Christians as the church (verses 1‚Äì16) and how they should live in the world (4:17‚Äì5:20). Text The original text was written in Koine Greek.

KJV *\\"Endeavouring\\" (KJV; NKJV: \\"endeavoring\\"): an 'eager determination to maintain the unity of the Spirit and the peace which benefits all'. *\\"Unity of the Spirit\\": The fact is 'this unity is given by the Spirit', originating from the 'shared experience of the one Spirit' (cf. ; ), not created by Christians, although they could destroy it. =Verses 4‚Äì6= : There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. NKJV The \\"triadic\\" confession one Spirit ... one Lord ... one God in the verses 4‚Äì6 recalls the scope of the unity in the church. The Character and Purpose of Ministry in the Body of Christ (4:7‚Äì16) This section can be seen as an elaboration of and , emphasizing that the church as Christ's body can only function effectively with the recognition of each church member's function within the body, and each individual function is appointed and made to work effectively by the enabling from Christ. =Verse 8= :Therefore He says: ::‚ÄúWhen He ascended on high, ::He led captivity captive, ::And gave gifts to men.‚Äù NKJV Psalm 68:18 reads: :\\"You have ascended on high, :You have led captivity captive; :You have received gifts among men, :Even from the rebellious, :That the Lord God might dwell there. =Verse 11= : And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, NKJV * \\"Apostles\\": refer to the people who were directly called by Jesus Christ, received the teaching from Him and the commission to preach it, guided by the Holy Spirit, \\"had a power to work miracles for the confirmation of their doctrine\\" as well as the authority to preach the Gospel everywhere, to plant churches, not confined to a particular place or church. An apostle was the first and chief office in the church, elected before Christ's ascension but not received power until the coming of the Spirit (on Pentecost). The task of the apostle is not only to bear witness of Christ in Jerusalem, in Judea and Samaria, but in the farthest ends of the earth. * \\"Prophets\\": are some people who are not private members of churches, but may prophesy or teach in a private way. They are not ordinary ministers of the word, but those who have a special gift of interpreting the Scriptures, the prophecies of the Old Testament, and foretelling things to come. Among these were Agabus and others in the church of Antioch (; ) * \\"Evangelists\\": are not meant the writers of the Gospels, as Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, some of which were also apostles, but rather as preachers of the Gospel, distinct from the ordinary ministers. Their position was seen as below that of the apostles, but above those of pastors and teachers; however, they were the companions or assistants of the apostles, and helped them in their work. Among them were Philip (the deacon), Luke, Titus, Timothy, and others. They were not fixed ministers in any place, but were sent anywhere as needed. * \\"Pastors and teachers\\": (also called \\"doctors\\" of the church) may be thought to be different, because of: ** the place where they work: the pastors in the church, while the teachers in the (church or theological) school ** the different subject of their ministry: the pastors attending to practical, the teachers to doctrinal points ** the charge of the church: the pastors are the shepherds of the flock, as overseers, same as the bishops and elders, whereas the teachers can be the gifted members in the church, assistants to the pastors (ministers of the word) :Nonetheless, it should be seen as one and the same office, that the term \\"teachers\\" is only explanative of the figurative word \\"pastors\\" or shepherds.John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible - Ephesians 4:11 =Verse 13= :till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; NKJV *\\"To a perfect man\\": Greek: \\"to a full-grown man\\".Note on Ephesians 4:13 in ESV To Live as the Church in the World (4:17‚Äì32) Stretching to 5:20, this part gives a general all-purpose set of instruction, with the classic \\"put off (vices) and put on (virtues)\\" in verses 22‚Äì32, using the familiar imagery of changing clothes for changing the character and lifestyle.

This chapter is a part of Paul's exhortation (Ephesians 4‚Äì6), with the particular section about how Christians should live in the world (4:17‚Äì5:20) and in their responsibilities as households (5:21‚Äì6:9).

The band, originally established by high school students, produced one single in their heyday that reached regional success, but also recorded several other unreleased material that garnered the group's re- interest in the 1980s. During their existence, the band was an essential piece in the development of psychedelic pop in Illinois. History In 1966, students of McHenry High School, Danny Smola (lead vocals), Eddy Weiss (rhythm guitar), Gary Weiss (drums), Jeff Brandht (bass guitar), George Sorrenson (lead guitar), and Bobby Lunak (acoustic guitar) formed The Lemon Drops in the midst of the developing Chicago music scene. The band gained a local following in the area as they constructed their own individual sound. By the end of the year, brother of Eddy and Gary Weiss, Reggie Weiss, formed his own recording company called Rembrandt Records. Upon hearing the band in rehearsal, Reggie Weiss signed the band to record in RCA Studios in Southern Illinois. Reggie Weiss wrote and recorded the band's debut single. The single included as the A-side \\"I Live in the Springtime\\" and the other featuring, \\"Listen Girl\\". Sorenson left the band a few days before recording, so Rick Ericksen is the guitarist the band added for the sessions on May 11, 1967. The band first 500 pressing were released, but recalled when Reggie Weiss discovered the drum track was not included. The drumless track was not totally recalled, and even made an appearance on the 1998 reissue of the Nuggets compilation. The second pressing of 1,000 copies featured the drums, and they were quickly bought out. AM Chicago radio station, WLS, wanted to distribute more copies, but Reggie Weiss could not afford to press more, so the single could not reach the charts nationally. The Lemon Drops gained notoriety from their debut, and performed all across Illinois. For their next proposed single, the band established themselves as a psychedelic band. To bolster their new sound, the band hired Dick Sidman as their lead singer. From October to December 1967, the band recorded numerous demos as they caught the attention of RCA Records. As Reggie Weiss recalled, \\"RCA was more interested in the $1,200 bill we ran up and I didn't have the money to pay for the sessions\\". In 1968, in an effort to intrigue a record label the band recorded two live albums from the Weiss home. Uni Records appeared to show interest, but the band declined after negotiations were considered unfavorably to them. As the band continued its search for a record deal, they performed live and continued recording as they still held a following in Chicago. The Bueno Vista label also expressed interest, however before the band could complete a deal, the owner unexpectedly died and the company folded. One last final attempt was also dashed when the band was involved in an acid party on the night before contract signing. The band would disband in the summer of 1969 as a result. Recordings of the Lemon Drops survived through the 1970s thanks to Reggie Weiss's management of several other bands. They, too, performed the Lemon Drops' songs and achieved substantial airplay in Illinois. The band's popularity was sustained enough for the returning interest in psychedelic music in the late 1980s. In 1985, the band received an official album release with their album, Crystal Pure, and a followup the year after called Second Album!. The albums included nearly all of the band's home recordings and the demos produced in RCA Studios.

Publication history Stalking the Night Fantastic was designed by Richard Tucholka, Chris Beiting, and Robert Sadler, and published by Tri-Tac Inc. in 1983 as a square-bound 104-page book. The following year, Tri-tac published a second edition that was ring-bound. Description Stalking the Night Fantastic is an eccentric supernatural horror system set in the near future in which the players are agents of the ultra-secret Bureau 13, an organization dedicated to fighting the growing influence of black magic and the supernatural. The character creation system uses 17 abilities to define a player character, most determined by rolling four dice then subtracting 4, resulting in a range of 0-20. Some are determined by rolling 2 dice and subtracting 20, or are calculated from previously generated ability scores. Once abilities have been determined, occupational skills and other skills are determined. There are also rules for magic and psionics, and two combat systems: a \\"Recommended Play\\" version for players, and a \\"Fast Play\\" system for NPCs. In addition, there are over twenty different tables covering various ways that characters can die, from asphyxiation to car accidents. Reception In the July 1984 edition of Dragon (Issue 87), Jerry Epperson felt the strongest part of Stalking the Night Fantastic was the list of encounters, which \\"run the entire gauntlet from African Witch Doctors and Aliens to Purple Monsters and Shapeless Disgusting Things.\\" But he had a number of issues with the game. He pointed out that although a character can theoretically have an ability score of zero, none of the ability score tables gave results for scores lower than 1. Epperson also disliked the two separate combat systems for characters and NPCs, which tilted combat results in favour of the NPCs. Epperson also found the rules very disorganized, saying, \\"an index would be indispensable as a gaming aid.\\" He concluded that \\"Stalking the Night Fantastic is not terrible game, just a very near miss... The game would suit 'tinkerers' or those GMs who only buy a game to get inspiration for their own systems. Beginners or players who are not enthusiastic about putting in some overtime on reworking the rules would do better to stay away from this one.\\" Reviews *Different Worlds (Issue 39 - May 1985) *Knights of the Dinner Table Magazine (Issue 174 - Apr 2011) References Category:Horror role-playing games Category:Role- playing games introduced in 1983 Category:Tri Tac Games games ","title":"Stalking the Night Fantastic"},{"id":"45648641","text":"The No Land Tax Campaign was a minor Australian political party formed prior to the 2015 New South Wales state election. It was formed in opposition to the levying of land tax, which in New South Wales applies to investment properties and holiday homes. The party achieved 1.90% of Legislative Council and 2.02% of Legislative Assembly votes at the election, but its failure to honour a promise to 3,600 workers to pay them $30 an hour ultimately led to legal trouble for the party. The party letterboxed homes in some parts of New South Wales with a flyer bearing the state's coat of arms, and advertising a website \\"electionwork.com.au\\". The website offered $30 an hour to \\"reliable, enthusiastic people\\" to hand out flyers and approach voters ‚Äî bonuses were offered if candidates achieved certain vote levels. The Electoral Commissioner, Colin Barry, commented that in 30 years, he had never seen a situation like it: \\"I'm not aware of any political party paying people to hand out material on election day. This was a very novel approach to say the least.\\" Through the ensuing months, Peter Jones, the party secretary, repeatedly promised to pay the 3,600 workers, blaming delays on various administrative and other causes. However, no money was paid and the party's website was taken offline. In August 2015, following an investigation which commenced in May, the Fair Work Ombudsman announced that they were taking legal action against Jones and the party, accusing them of a lack of co- operation. On 12 December 2017, the Federal Circuit Court fined Jones $13,315 and the party $67,575. Jones admitted contravening the workplace laws, but was criticised by the judge for his arrogant attitude and lack of remorse. The party was registered with the NSW Electoral Commission in March 2014, and deregistered on 15 July 2015.

Contents Throughout the book‚Äôs fourteen chapters, Phillips draws from over a decade of experience as a composer in the video game industry in order to explore the creative and technical aspects of game music composition. The book investigates the specialized skills and training necessary for the pursuit of a game music career. The structural requirements of game music are discussed, including the distinctive creative workflow involved in composing both interactive and linear music for games. Dynamic music constructs such as horizontal resequencing, vertical layering, MIDI, MOD, and generative music are explored. Also included is an examination of technical abilities, equipment necessities, and software proficiencies that assist in the creation of music for games. The concluding chapter focuses on skills that help a game composer pursue a sustainable career, network in the video game industry, and build a resilient business. Phillips intersperses practical advice with personal memories and anecdotes gleaned from her years in the video game industry. She describes the impetus that caused her to pursue a game music career, her early struggles to obtain work, her breakthrough when hired to join the music composition team for God of War, and her experiences during the development of several other game projects. Phillips also includes stories that explore the interpersonal dynamics within video game development and the gamer community, as well as the importance of game music fandom. The book periodically turns its attention to scholarly topics, including the influence of music on the immersion phenomenon, the relationship between game music and the Demographic Game Design (DGD) model, and several discussions of the role played by traditional music theory in the creation of music for video games.

Cytochrome c oxidase 8A is a subunit of the cytochrome c oxidase complex, also known as Complex IV. Mutations in the COX8A gene have been associated with complex IV deficiency with Leigh syndrome and epilepsy.  Structure  COX8A is a 7.6 kDa protein composed of 69 amino acids. This gene encodes the nuclear-encoded subunit 8A of the human mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase. The complex consists of 13 mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded subunits.  Function  Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It is a multi-subunit enzyme complex that couples the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen and contributes to a proton electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The mitochondrially-encoded subunits perform the electron transfer of proton pumping activities. The functions of the nuclear-encoded subunits are unknown but they may play a role in the regulation and assembly of the complex.  Clinical significance  COX8A is a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase and its function is important for the efficacy of complex IV. Mutations in COX8A can affect complex IV of the electron transport chain, resulting in complex IV deficiency. This disorder can have a wide range of clinical manifestations including Leigh syndrome, leukodystrophy, and severe epilepsy.  Interactions  COX8A has been shown to have 19 binary protein-protein interactions including 7 co-complex interactions. COX8A appears to interact with NPM1, MAGEA4, EDDM3B, BATF, AMBP, CREB1, and NCOR1.

In 2015, she was awarded the U.S. State Department's International Women of Courage Award, for her work with women and human rights advocacy in Syria. Biography Madj Izzat al-Chourbaji was born in 1981 in the town of Darayya, Syria. When she was six months old, her family fled to France to escape violence in the region, but returned in 1991. She graduated from Damascus University with a college degree in French Literature. After college, she worked on an anti- corruption campaign in Damascus suburbs. Activism When the Arab Spring spilled over into Syria, Chourbaji organized sit-ins calling for the release of political prisoners. She was arrested and suffered from police brutality. Despite her injuries, Chourbaji insisted on peaceful protest. She organized workshops among the prisoners to teach peace building and citizenship. Chourbaji persuaded 150 women detainees to go on a hunger strike to force the regime to present their cases to a judge. Her non-violent tactics eventually secured a hearing in a Damascus court, where she and 83 prisoners were granted release in a prisoner swap with the Syrian opposition. Continued surveillance by Syrian security forces resulted in Chourbaji's flight to neighboring Lebanon as an exile with her three children. Civil war in Syria has left many women vulnerable as targets of sexual violence and as collateral damage of war. Fleeing to the relative safety of Lebanon is challenging, as some 800,000 refugees have sought asylum there from conflict. Housing is scarce and rent prices are at a premium. There is little or no work available, making the prospect of paying rent difficult for refugees who fled with few material goods. As of January, 2015, the situation has become more difficult, as Lebanon has passed mandatory visa requirements for all Syrians crossing its border. On 2 January, 2014, Chourbaji founded Women Now in Lebanon, a center to administer support for refugee women. They provide training for hairdressing and cosmetology, computers, drawing, embroidery, English and French language study, and knitting in addition to psychological support to women and their children.

The Institute was later attached to the governing Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and served as a research center and publishing house for officially published works of Marxist doctrine. The Marx‚ÄìEngels Institute gathered unpublished manuscripts by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin and other leading Marxist theoreticians as well as collecting books, pamphlets and periodicals related to the socialist and organized labor movements. By 1930, the facility's holdings included more than 400,000 books and journals and more than 55,000 original and photocopy documents by Marx and Engels alone, making it one of the largest holdings of socialist-related material in the world. In February 1931, director of the Marx‚ÄìEngels Institute David Riazanov and others on the staff were purged for ideological reasons. In November of that same year, the Marx‚ÄìEngels Institute was merged with the larger and less scholarly Lenin Institute (established in 1923) to form the Marx‚ÄìEngels‚ÄìLenin Institute. The Institute was the coordinating authority for the systematic organization of documents released in the multi-volume editions of the Collected Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and numerous other official publications. It was officially terminated in November 1991, with the bulk of its archival holdings now residing with a successor organization, the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History (RGASPI).  History  Establishment = David Riazanov (1870‚Äì1938), head of the Marx‚ÄìEngels Institute from its formation in 1919 until his arrest in February 1931 The Marx‚ÄìEngels Institute was established in 1919 by the government of Soviet Russia as a branch of the Communist Academy, intended as an academic research facility to conduct historical studies and to collect documents deemed relevant to the new socialist regime.John Barber (1981). Soviet Historians in Crisis, 1928‚Äì1932. London: Macmillan. p. 15. First director of the facility, located in Moscow, was David Riazanov. The Institute assembled and maintained a research library devoted to socialist-related theme, amassing in a little over 10 years a collection of some 400,000 books, pamphlets, and journals, 15,000 manuscripts and 175,000 photocopies of original documents held elsewhere. Among these were 55,000 manuscripts by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels alone‚Äîfar and away the single most important accumulation of such material. The Institute included an academic staff which engaged in research on historical and topical themes of interest to the regime. The Institute included sections devoted to the history of the First and Second Internationals, the history of Germany, the history of France, the history of Great Britain, the history of the United States, the history of the countries of Southern Europe and the history of international relations. Also included were sections working in philosophy, economics, political science and the history of socialism in Slavic countries.Barber, Soviet Historians in Crisis, pp. 15‚Äì16. The main research orientation of the facility was towards history rather than other social sciences.Barber, Soviet Historians in Crisis, p. 16. By 1930, of the 109 employed by the Marx‚ÄìEngels Institute, fully 87 were historians. While working under the watchful eyes of the All-Union Communist Party, the Marx‚ÄìEngels Institute was not a one-party affair in its formative decade, with just 39 of its staff members also members of the Communist Party in 1930. During its first decade, the Institute published an array of books by the likes of Georgi Plekhanov, Karl Kautsky, Franz Mehring, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, David Ricardo and Adam Smith. The publication of the anticipated multi-volume works of Marx and Engels was started at this time (1927/28) in the form of two editions: An untranslated, complete edition (the first Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe), which was to comprise 42 volumes (12 of which were published until 1935 ‚Äì then this project was discontinued), and a first Russian edition in 28 volumes (Sochineniya1), the 33 bound books of which were completely published by 1947. The Institute also published two regular academic journals, Arkhiv Karla Marksa i Friderikha Engel'sa (Archive of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels) and Letopis' marksizma (Marxist Chronicle). = Lenin Institute = The Lenin Institute began as an independent archival project, established by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1923 to gather manuscripts with a view to publication of a scholarly edition of Vladimir Lenin's collected works. This work was accomplished through the publication of a thick periodical called Leninskii sbornik (Lenin Miscellany), some 25 numbers of which were published between 1924 and 1933. The mission of the Lenin Institute was expanded in 1924 by the 13th Congress of the Russian Communist Party to include the \\"study and dissemination of Leninism among the broad masses within and outside the party\\",\\"Thirteenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party Bolshevik\\" in The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1979), it quotes KPSS v rezoliutsiiakh i resheniiakh s\\"ezdov, konferentsii i plenumov TsK, 8th ed., vol. 3, 1970, p. 122. namely an enlarged purview which rendered obsolete the previously existing (Istpart).Barber, Soviet Historians in Crisis, pp. 16‚Äì17. In 1928, Istpart was dissolved and its functions fully absorbed by the Lenin Institute. The Lenin Institute was a slightly larger entity than the Marx‚ÄìEngels Institute, with a staff of 158 in 1929, but it did not share the reputation for impartial scholarship enjoyed by the older research library and scholarly think tank.Barber, Soviet Historians in Crisis, p. 17. The Lenin Institute was initially headed by Lev Kamenev, followed by Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov and after his death in 1928 by . = 1931 restructuring = In February 1931 as part of the Menshevik Trial in February 1931, economist Isaak Rubin‚Äîa former employee of the Marx‚ÄìEngels Institute‚Äîimplicated the head of the Institute David Riazanov as part of the conspiracy, with Riazanov accused of having hidden Menshevik documents in the facility.Barber, Soviet Historians in Crisis, p. 122. Although modern scholars consider the accusation in the February show trial to have been extremely dubious, Riazanov was nevertheless arrested and sent into exile outside of Moscow. A purge of Marx‚ÄìEngels Institute staff deemed to be ideologically suspicious followed. In the wake of the ideological purges of the Marx‚ÄìEngels Institute in November 1931, it was merged with the larger Lenin Institute to form the Marx‚ÄìEngels‚ÄìLenin Institute. = Later name changes = The Marx‚ÄìEngels‚ÄìLenin Institute was subsequently renamed multiple times. In 1952, the facility's formal attachment to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was formally noted with the expanded moniker Marx-Engels‚ÄìLenin Institute of the CC CPSU (). The name of deceased Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was added in 1956, with the Institute formally becoming the Marx‚ÄìEngels‚ÄìLenin‚ÄìStalin Institute of the CC CPSU. This remained in place until the onset of de-Stalinization following the so-called Secret Speech of Nikita Khrushchev in 1956. At this point, the name changed to Institute of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism of the CC CPSU (). During this period, beginning in the 1950s, the Institute was involved in the realization of major projects such as the publication of a second Russian edition of the collected works of Marx and Engels (Sochineniya2 with 39 basic and 11 supplementary volumes) and the comprehensive fifth edition of Lenin's Collected Works (55 volumes).Table of contents of all 55 volumes of the fifth Russian edition of Lenin's Collected Works From the 1970s onwards, it also participated with foreign partners in the publication of the English-language Marx/Engels Collected Works (50 volumes) and the second Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe. The name Institute of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism remained unaltered for nearly 35 years, when turmoil in the Soviet Union brought about a name change to Institute of the Theory and History of Socialism of the CC CPSU (). The Institute formally ceased to exist in November 1991 following the fall of the Soviet Union, with the Institute's library and archive transferred to a new entity called the Russian Independent Institute for Social and National Problems. The Central Party Archive of the Institute was placed under the control of the Russian Ministry of Culture and eventually emerged as the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History (RGASPI).

It begins at SR 26 in Woodstock and ends at U.S. Route 2 (US 2) in Rumford. The highway functions as an eastern bypass of SR 26 and US 2 in Bethel, providing a more direct north-south connection to and from points east. Route description SR 232 begins in Woodstock at SR 26 just east of Bryant Pond. It proceeds north, passing through the southeastern corner of Bethel and northwestern corner of Milton before entering the town of Rumford. SR 232 turns northwest and runs along the southern side of the Androscoggin River for about , then turns east, crosses the river, and terminates at US 2. History Most of SR 232, from its southern terminus to its intersection with South Rumford Road in Rumford near the Androscoggin River, was formerly part of SR 120 as it was designated in 1925. When that highway was truncated to US 2 in downtown Rumford in 1955, South Rumford Road was left unnumbered and the remaining stretch south to SR 26 was renumbered to SR 232.

Personal Life Bill was born on 2 January 1928 in Glasgow. He studied at Lenzie Academy, Glasgow, and Glasgow Veterinary College.His father, though a joiner and cabinetmaker, came from a farming background and moved his family shortly afterwards to an agricultural smallholding near Cumbernauld. Their early life there no doubt influenced Bill, his elder brother Tom and younger brother Oswald to study veterinary medicine. Bill graduated from Glasgow Veterinary College with honours in 1947 and then, already attracted to research, studied for a PhD, training in animal pathology at the College and in human pathology with Dan Cappell, Professor of Pathology at the Medical School. Consequently, he had a wide understanding of animal and human diseases which laid the foundation for his future research in comparative medicine. He taught at the University of Glasgow. In 1952 Bill married Anna Sharp, then a Lecturer at the Glasgow and West of Scotland College of Domestic Science. They eventually established a home in the countryside north of Glasgow that became a welcoming focus of generous hospitality for their family and huge circle of close friends, embracing a wide range of talented people from all walks of life and nationalities. Bill and Anna had known each other since their school days at Lenzie Academy when they had developed a passion for the Scottish countryside, especially the mountains. Over the years they engaged in sports that carried a certain frisson: mountaineering, skiing, motor rallying and particularly sailing, on the west coast of Scotland, France and Mallorca. At the same time Bill was a talented musician (he played trumpet, guitar and sang with a Scots and jazz bent), passionate about politics, a voracious reader and bon viveur (malt whiskies, and oysters at the Oyster Bar of the Grand Central Station in New York among his favourites). He died on 27 August 2011. He is succeeded by his daughters Freda and Ruth, both distinguished medical graduates, Freda‚Äôs children Amanda and Hamish, and his brother Oswald. Research In 1964, he discovered the retrovirus that causes leukemia and lymphoma in cats. During diagnostic pathology work at Garscube, Bill noted a very much higher prevalence of lymphoma in cats than in man. When a local veterinary practitioner drew to his attention to a household of cats in which a large number of cases had occurred in a short period of time, Bill considered that the reason might be that the disease was infectious, like the condition in domestic poultry and laboratory mice. He set up transmission experiments in cats using material from one of these cases. In 1963, after an incubation period of over a year, the disease was transmitted and a virus was demonstrated in the resulting tumours. This was subsequently shown to be a novel retrovirus, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV). The discovery of FeLV immediately provoked great interest in the field of oncology, coming at a time in the early 1960s when viruses were becoming seriously considered as causes of cancer in man. It was described as ‚ÄòExhibit A‚Äô in an application to the US Congress by the NCI for substantial funding to set up the Special Virus Cancer Program in 1968, which established an infrastructure for subsequent virus hunting in human cancers. Subsequently the most direct impact of FeLV on human medicine was the influence of Bill‚Äôs work on his friend Robert Gallo at NCI. Gallo was persuaded to explore human T-cell leukaemias for viruses after Bill found that most lymphomas caused by FeLV in cats were of T-lymphocyte origin. He established a way to grow T-cells in long-term culture from which came his discovery of the first human retrovirus, human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1), and later human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). With substantial funding from cancer charities, Bill then recruited a team which investigated the biology of FeLV in depth, together with collaborators throughout the world. The virus was shown to be a common infection of cats, particularly affecting animals kept in groups, in which the virus was transmitted very efficiently. Many animals recovered from the infection but some became persistently infected and had a very high risk of developing leukaemia or lymphoma. Diagnostic tests were developed which identified infected animals. By isolating these cats, spread of the virus could be halted. Bill also showed that vaccination was possible and the group collaborated with pharmaceutical companies in the development of a variety of commercial vaccines. The application of these methods of control has resulted in FeLV infection now being uncommon in many countries and has made a profound improvement to cat welfare. A valuable collaboration of Bill‚Äôs group with Jim Neil (FRSE) and his molecular biological colleagues at the Beatson Institute for Cancer Research on University of Glasgow's Garscube campus provided an opportunity to define the molecular events in the pathogenesis of lymphoma by FeLV. They discovered that the virus activated cellular oncogenes by several mechanisms of insertional mutagenesis. When Jim subsequently moved his group to the Veterinary School and established a Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, he began to use this device in other systems to identify novel oncogenes. He also became involved in defining the molecular events that caused other FeLV-related disease. Bill‚Äôs detailed pathological studies of haematopoietic disease in the cat showed that FeLV caused several types of anaemia as well as leukaemia and lymphoma. FeLV subtypes were recognised that caused pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and the group showed these viruses to be mutants of the common form of the virus, which blocked the production of red blood cell at a specific stage of differentiation. Another offshoot of the expertise generated by FeLV research was the creation of the Leukaemia Research Fund Human Virus Centre with the remit to discover viruses as causes of human leukaemia and lymphoma. The first director was David Onions (FRSE) who had been involved in defining the pathogenesis of PRCA in cats. The director is currently Bill‚Äôs daughter, Ruth, a graduate in medicine who had been a postgraduate scientist with Robert Gallo. In 1968 Bill was appointed Professor of Veterinary Pathology at Glasgow and attracted substantial funding for new research laboratories. In the 1970s and 1980s, following observations in the 1960s of papillomas in association with clusters of vulvo-cutaneous carcinomas in Friesian cattle in the Highlands of Kenya, with Max Murray (FRSE), he investigated the reasons for a high incidence of alimentary tract carcinoma in cattle in parts of Scotland. Through a large abattoir survey, he showed that papillomas were more common and occurred in greater numbers in animals of all ages on the cancer farms compared to lowland cattle, and that they were caused by a novel virus, bovine papillomavirus type 4 (BPV-4). In older cattle, he noted that cancers could develop from existing papillomas and proposed that immunosuppressants and carcinogens in bracken were responsible for this malignant progression. At this time he established a productive collaboration with Saveria Campo (FRSE) of the Beatson Institute. With Bill, she and her colleagues investigated in detail the biology of bovine papillomaviruses, especially BPV-1, -2 and -4, and developed recombinant vaccines of BPV-4 proteins that protected cattle from developing papillomas when challenged, and indeed could slow the growth of existing tumours. These results laid the conceptual framework for the production of vaccines against the subtypes of human papillomaviruses that cause cervical cancer in women, which are now offered routinely to young women in many countries. After the co-discovery of HIV by Robert Gallo and Luc Montagnier, Bill renewed his association with Gallo and in the late 1980s worked with him in Washington as a Fogarty Scholar on the nascent field of HIV vaccine research. Bill was one of a group of eminent scientists who successfully made the case to the Thatcher government that this novel disease was so important that it required new investment in research despite public expenditure cuts. Consequently, he became a founder member of the AIDS Directed Programme of the MRC. With colleagues in Glasgow, particularly Jim Neil and his brother Oswald, he established a research group that exploited another newly discovered retrovirus, feline immunodeficiency virus, as a model for HIV vaccination. Perhaps the most telling achievement of the group was determining the constraints that apply to vaccination with this type of retrovirus: in particular, the discovery that certain prototypic vaccines enhanced the virus infection rather than protecting against it. Unfortunately this outcome was confirmed subsequently by trials of a HIV vaccine. Work on both FeLV and FIV continues at the School in the Retrovirus Research Laboratory. He was made a Fellow the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1965 and awarded the Makdougall- Brisbane Prize 1980-82, and was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1980. Bill‚Äôs family have had a remarkable association with the Society. His uncle, broadcaster Harry Hoggan, brother Oswald, and daughter Ruth were all elected Fellows in following years.

One of a class of five sister ships popularly known as \\"Lady Boats\\", she was built for the Canadian National Steamship Company (CNS). The five vessels were Royal Mail Ships that CNS operated from Halifax, Nova Scotia and the Caribbean via Bermuda. Lady Nelson was sold to Egyptian owners in 1953 and served as Gumhuryat Misr and Alwadi until she was scrapped in 1968. Building and peacetime service Lady Nelson was built in 1928 by Cammell Laird of Birkenhead, on the Wirral in England, the same builder for all five Lady class liners. Like her sisters Lady Nelson was an oil-burner, with a set of four Cammell Laird steam turbines driving the propeller shafts to her twin screws by single-reduction gearing. She had three passenger decks, and by 1931 she was equipped with a direction finding device. CN introduced the liners which became known as \\"Lady Boats\\" for mail, freight and passenger traffic between Canada, Bermuda and the Caribbean. Lady Nelson along with and were designed for service to eastern islands of the British West Indies and had larger passenger capacity but lesser cargo capacity than and who were built for service to western islands., p. 16 The hulls of all the Lady Boats were painted white, which then was a relatively new fashion among shipping companies, and confined largely to passenger ships serving tropical or sub- tropical destinations.

The ships were introduced at the same time as Canada opened the Pier 21 ocean liner terminal in Halifax designed to give Canada a competitive presence in Atlantic travel routes.\\"Ticket Agents Dine on Liner\\", Halifax Chronicle November 28, 1928, LAC RG 76, Vol. 666, File C1594, pt. 2 Lady Nelson sailed fortnightly between Halifax and British Guiana via Boston, Bermuda, the Leeward Islands, the Windward Islands and Barbados. In summer the route was extended to the port of Montreal. CN named each of its five new liners after the wife of an English or British admiral who was noted for his actions in the Caribbean. Lady Nelsons namesake was Frances Nelson, wife of the famous Royal Navy Admiral Horatio Nelson.

Lady Nelson hospital ship flag at Stadacona Hospital CFB Halifax The Canadian government decided to convert Lady Nelson to a hospital ship to bring home Canadian wounded. Canadians had previously been sent home for treatment on British hospital ships but as casualties mounted from fighting in North Africa, the British asked Canada to provide its own hospital ships.Douglas N. W. Smith, \\"Bringing Home the Wounded\\", Canadian Rail Passenger Yearbook 1996‚Äì1997 Edition, Trackside Canada, Ottawa, p. 49-64. Although informally called HMCS or HMCHS Lady Nelson by her crew, she remained owned by Canadian National Steamships, under charter by the Canadian Department of National Defence and retained a civilian crew of 75 from the Canadian Merchant Navy and 100 medical staff from the Canadian Army.Hannington, p. 85 Completed as a hospital ship in April 1943, Lady Nelson had an operating theatre, x-ray machine and wards for 515 men. A special medical embarkation unit was created at Pier 21 in Halifax to unload patients and transfer and escort them on hospital trains which took the wounded to hospitals across Canada. As a hospital ship, Lady Nelson made 30 crossings of the Atlantic and brought 25,000 wounded Canadians home. When fighting ended in Europe in June 1945, Lady Nelson was switched to returning Canadian soldiers and war brides.John Boileau, \\"History of the 5 Lady Boats\\" Legion Magazine January 2007 Postwar Lady Nelson returned to civilian duties in 1946, the only Lady Boat, along with Lady Rodney, to survive the war. However declining passenger traffic due to air travel, high fuel consumption from the ship's turbine engines and rising labour costs made the Lady Boats too expensive to run. It was decided to replace the two lady boats with motor vessels with smaller passenger capacity in 1951.Hannington, p. 133 In 1952 Lady Nelson and Lady Rodney were sold to Egyptian owners for $750,000. After being refitted at Alexandria and then renamed, they were used to carry passengers in the Mediterranean and Red Seas.Boileau, \\"History of the 5 Lady Boats\\" Under her new owner, the Khedivial Mail line, Lady Nelson was renamed Gumhuryat Misr, later becoming Alwadi in 1960 until she was scrapped in 1968.\\"Canadian Hospital Ships\\", Royal Canadian Dental Corps Association Newsletter, Fall 2014, p. 35 Legacy A large model of the ship in hospital colours is displayed at the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 in Halifax at the terminal where Lady Nelson operated for most of her career. A short street at CFB Halifax is named Lady Nelson Road in her honour. The Naval Museum of Halifax owns a 1944 painting by Wilfred Leonard Whitern of Lady Nelson and her original hospital ship flags which are displayed in the Stadacona Health Centre at CFB Halifax. Lady Nelson is also the subject of two paintings in the war art collection of the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa.

Early life and education  Jean-Louis √âtienne was born in Vielmur-sur-Agout in the department of Tarn. He studied at the technical high school of Mazamet where he graduated with a CAP (Certificat d'Aptitude Professionnelle) in machining, then at the high school of Castres, and at the Facult√© de M√©decine of the Paul Sabatier University of Toulouse. He obtained a doctorate in general medicine graduated with a DESS (Dipl√¥me d'√âtudes Sup√©rieures Sp√©cialis√©es) in Dietetics and food, as well as a diploma in biology and sports medicine. Jean-Louis √âtienne is also a licensed doctor of the Merchant navy.  Career as explorer  Jean-Louis √âtienne got interested in medical matters and human psychology in extreme conditions. In order to further his research, he participated in several expeditions in Himalaya, Greenland and Patagonia. He was a teammate on the Pen Duick VI under √âric Tabarly for its race around the world in 1977‚Äì78. He is well known for his expeditions in the Arctic and Antarctica, with scientific as well as pedagogical goals, which attracted media coverage, disseminating knowledge and research, and promoting protection of the environment. He became famous with the feat of the 1990 International Trans-Antarctica Expedition, a 6,300 km crossing on foot, with dogs, of the Austral continent.  List of expeditions  *March‚ÄìApril 1986 : he was the first to reach the North pole, with continuing aerial resupply, skiing solo for 63 days. *July 1989‚ÄìMarch 1990 : Trans-Antarctica, a seven-month expedition during Austral summer, where he and five other men of different nationality, fully crossed with their dogs and sleighs, the 6,300 km of the Antarctic continent, on the geographical South pole. *1991‚Äì96 : on the schooner Antarctica (currently the Tara), he led scientific expeditions to Antarctica and Spitsbergen. *April‚ÄìJuly 2002 : the Mission Banquise on the Polar Observer drifted for three months near the North pole to study global warming. *January‚ÄìApril 2005 : Clipperton expedition on the Clipperton Island in the Pacific ocean to establish an inventory of biodiversity. *April 2007‚ÄìMarch 2008 : Total Pole Airship, a scientific expedition to measure the thickness of the floe of the Arctic ocean, via the geographic North pole, for the International Polar Year.

After a video of the incident was published, the SAE's OU chapter was closed and two of its members were expelled. Incidents recorded on video On March 7, 2015, videos were recorded while fraternity members and their dates were riding on a chartered bus to an event celebrating the national organization's Founder's Day. In the video the students are heard singing a chant to the tune of \\"If You're Happy and You Know It\\". The chant begins with the refrain, \\"There will never be a nigger at SAE\\", which is followed by the lyrics, \\"You can hang them from a tree, but they'll never sign with me\\", followed again by the refrain. The chant also referenced two key elements of the Jim Crow era; lynching (You can hang them from a tree) and racial segregation (but they'll never sign with me), in the form of denial of admission to people of color (African Americans in this case) or any ethnicity other than white into the fraternity. The video of the incident was reported on by The Oklahoma Daily on Sunday March 8, and also posted online by student group OU Unheard. An additional video emerged showing the fraternity's house mother, Beauton Gilbow, using the same word \\"nigger\\" while singing along to a rap song at the fraternity in 2013. Gilbow later stated that she was singing along at the time to rapper Trinidad James' song \\"All Gold Everything\\", which heavily uses the same racial pejorative, and apologized for any offense. AftermathSAE chapter suspended= On March 8, 2015, the national office of Sigma Alpha Epsilon closed the OU Chapter house, and OU officials gave SAE members until the end of March 10, 2015 to move out. Two days later, OU Facilities Management removed the fraternity's Greek letters from the house. They later put a padlock on the facility's gate, blocked off the parking lot with barriers and caution tape and changed the locks. At a March 18 press conference, the national SAE office apologized and vowed to promote diversity. The fraternity strongly denied that members had been taught the song, and stated they were investigating additional racist incidents. Elsewhere, the University of Texas said it was looking into claims the chant was used by SAE members there. =Students expelled= University of Oklahoma president David Boren ordered the expulsion of two students, Levi Pettit and Parker Rice. Through two letters addressed to them, Boren stated that the expulsion was deemed proper as they \\"played a leadership role\\" in creating \\"an extremely hostile learning environment\\". The action taken by the university was based on school's Student Rights & Responsibilities Code. The LA Times reported that Boren appeared to be alluding to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which bans racial discrimination at universities receiving federal money. However, the expulsions may have been a violation of the students' first amendment rights. First Amendment law specialist and UCLA Law professor Eugene Volokh asserted that President Boren's actions were unconstitutional. Oklahoma State University media law associate professor Joey Senat stated that the chant was offensive but is still protected free speech. Glenn Reynolds, a Professor of Law at the University of Tennessee, expressed the opinion that as a former U.S. senator, Boren should have known that the university was breaking the law in expelling the two students. A Washington Post article reported that a Sigma Chi fraternity successfully challenged similar action taken against them by George Mason University in 1992. On March 13, alumni on the board of OU's SAE chapter hired civil rights attorney Stephen Jones to look into the legal issues involving the chapter's suspension and eviction of members from its fraternity house at OU campus. The national office of SAE stated that it was not involved in retaining Mr. Jones and was unaware of his intentions, and that board officials with the OU local chapter had stopped communicating with them since the chapter was closed on March 9. On March 25, Levi Pettit apologized publicly for his actions. Parker Rice issued an apology earlier on March 10, 2015 and added that he led the chant under the influence of alcohol, while also stating that the chant was \\"taught to them\\". Protesters later gathered outside the Rice family home in Dallas and protested his actions. In response to Rice's apology, a member of the chapter who was not with the members on the bus but was present in the chapter house on the day of the incident, confirmed in an interview that the students and members of the chapter were drinking alcohol in the chapter house before the incident. OU president Boren suspected that the chant was learned on the fraternity's leadership cruise but the SAE national headquarters issued a statement that the chant is not one of their sanctioned songs and they would never allow such chant to be sung, stating that any member or chapter who adopts hostile chants are dealt with severe punishment. However, both the national headquarters and Boren state that the chant was informally shared during the leadership cruise by other members. =Reactions= The SAE-OU chapter's only two African- American alumni, Jonathon Davis and William Bruce James II, defended the house mother, Beauton Gilbow, over her actions and voiced out their support for the chapter's closure. Davis has stated that his co-members and batch mates in the chapter would never allow discriminatory behaviour to take place while James re-echoed Davis' statements and stated that he disowns the people in the videos. Meanwhile, a student from the rival Oklahoma State University, who also bears the name Parker Rice, became the subject of hate mail and death threats in a case of mistaken identity. Unlike the Parker Rice in the racist chant who was a Dallas native, the other Parker Rice, was a native of Oklahoma and was an Asian Studies student majoring in Japanese. He admits his membership at the Oklahoma State University chapter of Alpha Phi Omega while condemning the racist chant incident. The Oklahoma-native Rice later posted on social media that he has no connection to SAE and that he was not the Parker Rice in the video. In response to the video the Oklahoma Sooners college football team held arm-in-arm protest vigils instead of attending practice. Several news media reports highlighted the fact that SAE, which was founded before the American Civil War in the South had a history of discriminatory incidents. Robby Soave of the Reason Foundation wrote that the OU had failed to expel a freshman football player \\"caught on tape punching a female student in the face\\" in 2014. He concluded, \\"if anybody was going to be railroaded off campus without so much as a hearing, you would think it might be perpetrators of actual violence, rather than perpetrators of offensive speech (which is not actually a category of crime).\\" Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough of Morning Joe television show blamed the fraternity brothers' use of the word on hip hop music. Actor and Delta Tau Delta alum Will Ferrell said the incident might be an argument to end the entire college fraternity system. \\"The incident in Oklahoma, that is a real argument for getting rid of the system altogether, in my opinion, even having been through a fraternity,\\" he told The New York Times. On March 23rd, United States President Barack Obama responded to the incident during an interview with the Huffington Post. Obama said it was \\"not the first time that somebody at a fraternity has done something stupid, racist, sexist,\\" and that it was likely not the last. He commended University of Oklahoma President David Boren for his swift action, and the OU community's response to the video. Beginning in 2015, first year students and faculty have been required to take a five-hour course on diversity. Although several news outlets have connected the training to the chanting video, the course was announced in January, prior to the incident, in connection with a rumors of a \\"Cowboy and Indians\\" theme party being planned by a different fraternity. = Chapter house repurposed = On March 10, 2015, OU regained priority over the property. The former chapter house was leased to SAE by OU and was not SAE property. Instead, the chapter house had always been under the ownership of the University. The outer wall of the building was vandalized with black spray paint on the day of the incident, and was promptly removed by the University. At the beginning of the 2016 academic semester, the former SAE chapter house became the location for OU's University Community Center, which houses the Disability Resource Center (DRC) and the Student Veterans' Association. The seizure of the fraternity house became an opportunity for the DRC to expand, since the center was previously a small wing at Goddard Health Center and had been searching for a location to expand to. Within the Student Veterans' Association's lounge, there is a small exhibit a part of the Henderson Scholars Program in the lower lobby of the former chapter house, to notable university alumni such as Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher who performed a significant role in the Civil Rights Movement in Oklahoma.

The landing was established in 1824 at the mouth of Spring Creek on the Tennessee River. As large craft could not navigate Spring Creek to reach Tuscumbia, the landing was built to transfer goods to and from the town. The New Orleans and Tuscumbia Steamboat Company was created in 1825, and connected The Shoals with towns on the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. Wagons were used to haul goods between the landing and the town until a horse-drawn railroad, the first railroad west of the Appalachian Mountains, was built from 1831 to 1832. The line was later extended to Decatur in 1834, bypassing the treacherous shoals on the Tennessee River, and was renamed the Tuscumbia, Courtland and Decatur Railroad. The landing was also a stop for many Muscogee and Cherokee along the Trail of Tears. During the Civil War, the landing was heavily damaged in April 1862 by Colonel John Basil Turchin's troops; it was completely destroyed by General Grenville M. Dodge in April 1863, in the lead- up to Streight's Raid. Following the war, Florence became the port of choice in the Shoals, as the warehouses at Tuscumbia were never rebuilt. The site contains six limestone foundations of the main depot along the river, as well as foundation walls of a terminal at the top of a bluff and the remnants of a wagon road. The depot was built in 1832, and was three stories tall. A floating wharf was connected to the uppermost floor of the building, while the two lower floors were used for storage.

In 2015 he came to national attention competing on 14th season of singing talent reality show American Idol both for his soulful vocals and \\"his original fashion sense - head scarves, furry jackets and all.\\" After finishing in sixth place he plans to continue film and fashion projects that were in process before he was chosen for the show as well as performing. Alexander also works as a manager at French Connection, a men's clothier, in The Shops at Canal Place in New Orleans. Early life and schooling Alexander was born and raised in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans which faced catastrophic damage during and after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. It was a rough area where he lived, but says it made him tough while the city overall made him an artist. He states that growing up was difficult as he could not go out and play in his neighborhood so relied on his imagination. He noted there was always a fight or shooting or something going on so that it wasn't safe outside, but he still sees his hometown as a beautiful and artsy city. He was also bullied in school so had very few friends. Alexander first started singing when he was six, together with his cousins he would \\"learn, sing, and write songs when we got together.\\" He didn't start pursuing singing until he joined a youth center in his sophomore year in high school. He is a graduate of McDonogh 35 High School a public high school that was the first for African-American pupils in the State of Louisiana after being converted from an all-white, and all-male elementary school.Woyshner and Bohan, \\"Introduction.\\" p. 11, . \\"[...]in McDonogh #35 Senior High School in New Orleans. In 1917, McDonogh #35 was established as the first public high school for Black children in Louisiana.\\" Alexander's mentor and drama instructor at the school, Troy Populous, encourage him to channel his creative energy into drama class. Populous could see Alexander had charisma, an 'it' factor, and Alexander agreed that he was able to channel his frustration into \\"something beautiful, which at the time was theater.\\" Alexander performed in a school production of August Wilson's Fences, and part of a performing troupe who traveled to Paris in 2010 to perform the musical \\"Ain't Misbehavin'\\" at the Banlieues Bleues Festival. Alexander states: \\"Music is one of my only releases. It's an indirect way for me to express myself. It has given me so many opportunities to travel at a young age, introduced me to different people and ways of life.\\" He graduated in May 2011 and currently is a full-time manager at French Connection, a retail clothier for men. Musical influences Alexander says that many artists have made impacts on him with a few of his biggest inspirations as Erykah Badu, David Bowie, Andre 3000, Jimi Hendrix, Lenny Kravitz, Lorde, Sia \\"and the list goes on for miles.\\" He cites Fantasia, Chris Daughtry, Adam Lambert, Joshua Ledet and Jena Irene as his all-time favorite AI performers. When Idol asked him to name his top three all-time songs he listed \\"Shake It Out\\" by Florence & The Machine, \\"Youth\\" by Daughter, and \\"God From The Machine\\" by Santigold, he said, \\"The lyrics, heavy drums and almost tribal chanting in these songs are dope.\\" He also said Lorde was definitely a writer he'd like to work with and that she, Santigold, and Erykah Badu are his favorite and most influential artists because \\"They're each very unique human beings with very distinct voices and styles. I admire their originality and the work they put into their music.\\" American IdolOverview= Alexander first auditioned for the twelfth season of American Idol in 2012 in New Orleans' Mercedes-Benz Superdome where he advanced to sing his reworked version of \\"Love Potion No. 9\\" for the executive producers. He since worked at developing himself personally and expressing what he \\"wants to represent as an artist.\\" He auditioned for the fourteenth season of American Idol and won his ticket to Hollywood Week in June 2014 at Lakefront Arena in New Orleans. Callbacks were also in New Orleans, with this season's celebrity judges all returning from the prior year, Harry Connick, Jr., Jennifer Lopez and Keith Urban, and were held at the Morial Convention Center in August. The show airs in 2015 starting in January. He has practiced a lot of his songs and arrangements both at home and during the early hours of opening the retail store he opened and had a few hours before customers arrived. Alexander's group round for Hollywood Week was in a quartet where he was the oldest member, they successfully performed Bruno Mars' \\"Runaway Baby\\". The top 24 semi-finals showcases were the first time the contestants were in front of a live audience to gain their votes, and filmed in Detroit's historic The Fillmore Detroit in homage to the theme Motown. Alexander performed Screamin' Jay Hawkins' \\"I Put a Spell on You\\" to the judges' approval, including judge Keith Urban deeming it \\"a Grammy performance\\". For \\"I Put a Spell on You\\" he chose it about a week before the show and experimented with American Idols arranger, he says the song was different every time he did it and is his favorite performance from his competing. He also acknowledged that he needs more technical training to know the argot of arranging and felt lucky he was able to work with people who knew how to translate his vision. For the top 16 show round narrowing the competition to the top 12, ten contestants were chosen by popular votes from ballots cast. Alexander was among the remaining 6 from who the judges chose him and Adanna Duru as wild card choices. For the songs from the movies week he sang Lo-Fang's stripped-down arrangement of Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta's \\"You're the One That I Want\\" from the 1978 musical Grease which 'People' magazine said \\"stole the show\\". Alexander advanced to the top 7 with fellow New Orleans singer Joey Cook, who is originally from Virginia but has made the city her new home. The week that Cook was eliminated Alexander was upset that two of his friends Cook and Rayvon Owen hadn't made it into the top six, with those results all delivered on live TV. Alexander was visibly upset and called the situation \\"whack\\", something Cook later characterized as heroic, \\"Quentin is a very emotional person. He's very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesn't hide his emotions. He's honest. He's a raw human being, and I think what happened last night was at the perfect example of that and how emotional he is.\\" Cook was eliminated in the 'Top 6' week and Alexander expressed his frustration that she didn't get into the top six. Of the same night Billboard said Alexander \\"always gives strong interpretations of lyrics and highly conceptual performances\\". National media outlets reported on the exchange between judge Harry Connick Jr. and Alexander the noting the incident of Connick scolding a contestant was awkward. The producers played up the exchange in what Music Times termed \\"what seemed like shady circumstances\\" to replay the incident throughout the week in show promos and at the beginning of the Top 5 show. An AI source also stated that for fairness purposes the judges and contestants have a strict wall of silence between them and only interact onstage so Connick Jr. and Alexander have not had contact since last week. Alexander was eliminated the next show the following week with what Music Times questioned as possibly the first time American Idol \\"went into an episode with what seemed to be a very clear agenda.\\" Yahoos managing editor Lyndsey Parker detailed many points that she argued was American Idol \\"throwing Quentin Alexander under the tour bus\\" referring to the idiom of throw under the bus by sacrificing a friend as the show heavily promotes the summer tour which only guarantees the top five finalists will be included. Included in her critique was that the show had aired the promotional video featuring the confrontation which she characterized as \\"misleadingly edited\\" to boost ratings which have been historically low, had a surprisingly few negative judges comments, and instead lavish praise for other contestants while Alexander's was pointedly negative, and what Parker saw as a \\"backhanded and unflattering\\" exchange from Connick Jr. insinuating Alexander needed Auto- Tune. She also noted that the \\"Fan Save\\" portion was handled uniquely in that the other contestant Rayon Owen didn't have a replay or critique until after a commercial break, while Alexander did not get the same treatment, and host Ryan Seacrest claimed Alexander had muttered \\"I give up\\" which Alexander had to clarify was actually \\"I give it up.\\"USA Today echoed the sentiment that the awkward comments likely led to his elimination from the show. =Appearance= Alexander's personal style and clothing have become a touchstone for viewers and critics of AI. Bustle states that from his style \\"to his quirky personality and unique voice, Alexander screams ‚Äúartsy‚Äù and ‚Äúsoul‚Äù ‚Äî exactly what Connick, Jr. [also a New Orleans' son] was looking for in his hometown.\\" As part of his competition on the popular television show the producers, and media have noted his unique dress appearance and style. Scott Borchetta, a record executive and on-air contestant coach stated \\"Quentin has this really cool New Orleans vibe about him. He has these great piercing eyes. Every time he shows up, everybody always wants to know, 'What is Quentin wearing?' because it's always cool, and it's thrift-shop cool. It's like, 'You got that for what? Where?'\\" In Bustle, entertainment writer Jessica Molinari noted he \\"performed the song as if he was actually casting a spell on the audience, and that‚Äôs what made it so amazing. From his outfit (did you see that fur coat?!), to his hair, to his crazy-intense eye contact, Alexander fully immersed himself in his performance and played a character ‚Äî and that‚Äôs what sets him apart as an artist.\\" Show judge Keith Urban stated, when asked \\"What is it about him that viewers are responding to?\\", \\"He's a conceptual artist, with his sense of arrangement, his interpretation, the way he looks.\\" Heavy said he is \\"revered for his intensity and his fashion risks\\" on the show. After his elimination USA Today stated, \\"Throughout his run on Idol, Alexander combined a flair for dramatic musical performances with outlandish costumes, gaining confidence and creating some of the season's most memorable moments along the way\\" Alexander states that he would sketch out or toward the end when it was more hectic just give direction as to what he wanted his style to look like and would work with the show to find a balance between him as an artist verses him as an American Idol. =Performances= { class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Week ! scope=\\"col\\"  Theme ! scope=\\"col\\"  Song(s) ! scope=\\"col\\"  Original artist(s) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Auditions  Contestant's choice  \\"Royals\\"  Lorde - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Hollywood Week - group  Group round  \\"Runaway Baby\\"  Bruno Mars - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Hollywood Week - solo round  Solo round  \\"Riptide\\"  Vance Joy - ! scope=\\"row\\"  House of Blues (Top 48)  Contestant's choice  \\"Youth\\"  Foxes - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Top 24  Contestant's choice  \\"I Put a Spell on You\\"  Screamin' Jay Hawkins - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Top 16  Music of Motown  \\"Master Blaster (Jammin')\\"  Stevie Wonder - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Top 12  \\"Back to the Start\\"  \\"Royals\\"  Lorde - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Top 11 (first week)  \\"Get the Party Started\\"  \\"Rolling in the Deep\\"  Adele - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Top 11 (second week)  Songs from the Movies  \\"You're the One That I Want\\"  John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Top 9  Songs from the 1980s  \\"In the Air Tonight\\"  Phil Collins - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Top 8  Kelly Clarkson  \\"Dark Side\\"  Kelly Clarkson - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Top 7  Billboard Hot 100  \\"Latch\\"  Disclosure feat.

It will hold paintings, photography, illustration, cinematic art and digital art from Lucas's personal collection, and a Star Wars exhibit. It will be located in Exposition Park, Los Angeles, California. Collections The museum will house works by artists such as Howard Chandler Christy, N.C. Wyeth, Maxfield Parrish, and Norman Rockwell. In 2018, the museum announced the acquisition of Rockwell‚Äôs painting ‚ÄúShuffleton‚Äôs Barbershop‚Äù from the Berkshire Museum in Western Massachusetts. In January 2020, the museum announced the acquisition of the Separate Cinema archive. Materials in the archive include posters, lobby cards, film stills, scripts, and other artifacts that track the history of African American movies from 1904 to the contemporary era. In total, the archive contains about 37,000 objects. Dorothy Dandridge, Paul Robeson, Duke Ellington, Sidney Poitier, and Josephine Baker are among the stars whose work is documented in the collection. A statement by museum CEO Sandra Jackson-Dumont said \\"The Separate Cinema Archive will not only provide film scholars with incredible opportunities for research, this treasure trove will also catalyze important conversations about the inspiring narratives of African American perspectives represented through film.‚Äù History The first president of the museum was Don Bacigalupi, former president of Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas; he stepped down from this role in early 2019. In October 2019, Sandra Jackson-Dumont was announced as director and CEO. =Proposed San Francisco Presidio site= To be known as the Lucas Cultural Arts Museum, it was originally planned for San Francisco, on Crissy Field. This version of the museum would have held Lucas's art collection, which is estimated to be worth approximately $1 billion. After four years of negotiation with The Presidio Trust over the land in San Francisco, Lucas announced instead that Chicago would host the museum, due in part to interest from the city's mayor, Rahm Emanuel, and the promise of land on the shore of Lake Michigan.Erdman, Shelby Lin (June 25, 2014). \\"Chicago Beats Out San Francisco for New George Lucas Museum\\" , CNN. Retrieved June 26, 2014. The museum would lease the land from the Chicago Park District for $1 a year.Geiger, Kim (November 12, 2014). \\"Parks Group to Sue over Lakefront Site for Lucas Museum\\" , Chicago Tribune. Retrieved June 26, 2016. Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti also made a bid to host the project, offering Lucas land in Exposition Park near the University of Southern California. Youngstown Mayor John McNally has also proposed to Lucas to locate the museum in Youngstown, Ohio offering donated land in the city's downtown. =Proposed Chicago site= Previous plan for the museum in Chicago The proposed site on a parking lot near Soldier Field, Burnham Harbor and the Museum Campus was chosen by a Chicago city commission. After the formal announcement of the museum's location on Chicago's lake shore and the later unveiling of its architecture, the project faced opposition again. In an editorial, the Chicago Tribune condemned the size of the structure, referring to it as \\"a monument to its patron rather than a modest addition to a democratic public space\\". The Chicago plan called for a museum building roughly four times the size of the one planned for San Francisco, though that size was later scaled back. The Tribune also expressed worries about the cost of maintenance, to be absorbed by taxpayers, and the damage to the preservation of the lake front. Friends of the Parks, a Chicago-area preservation organization, opposed the plan, citing a ban on development on the land set aside for Lucas. It filed a federal suit to block the development, arguing that granting the museum a 99-year lease \\"effectively surrenders control\\" of prime lakefront property to a museum that is \\"not for the benefit of the public\\" but would \\"promote private and/or commercial interests\\". In March 2015, U.S. District Judge John Darrah ruled the land intended for the museum is held in public trust. Thus, the Illinois General Assembly is the only body with the power to allow construction to proceed, under certain limitations. The state subsequently approved a law designed to enable such projects, and the Chicago City Council approved zoning. while the Chicago Park District approved a long-term lease and litigation on ensued. MAD architects, headed by Ma Yansong, was responsible for designing a building for the Chicago site, while VOA Associates was designated to oversee construction. Studio Gang Architects, already involved in the rehabilitation of Northerly Island, was selected to design the landscape. The design was met with some criticism upon release. Blair Kamin of the Chicago Tribune called the structure \\"needlessly massive\\" and called for a \\"dose of restraint\\" to preserve the lakefront. In Crain's Chicago Business, Greg Hinz derided it as \\"[yelling] and [carrying] on, in its own way defacing the city's lakefront as much as any teenager with a can of spray paint...\\". Revised plans were released in September 2015, which scaled back on the size of the project but otherwise kept the basic design. Criticism also has been leveled against Friends of the Parks for its opposition. In May 2016, Bill Kurtis wrote an op-ed in support of the Lucas Museum which appeared in the Chicago Tribune. On May 3, 2016, a statement released by Mellody Hobson, wife of George Lucas, stated that the couple was seeking other cities to host the museum after a protracted confrontation with Friends of the Parks. On June 24, 2016, Lucas announced that the museum would not be located in Chicago.O'Connell, Patrick M.; Ruthhart, Bill (June 24, 2016). \\"Lucas Museum Drops Plan to Build in Chicago\\" , Chicago Tribune.

Retrieved June 26, 2016. =Los Angeles site= In June 2016, museum officials announced that they were considering sites in Los Angeles and San Francisco. George Lucas announced on January 10, 2017, the museum he wishes to construct will be built and located in Exposition Park in Los Angeles, California, citing the proximity of University of Southern California, his alma mater, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Banc of California Stadium, other museums, and local schools in the South Los Angeles region. The museum that will be constructed was designed by Chinese architecture firm MAD Architects (MAD Studio) and architect of record Stantec. The $1 billion project will have 300,000 square feet of floor space. It will be five levels, 115 ft. high and have a library, offices and two theaters. The museum is redeveloping the area surrounding the museum in Exposition Park. Plans call for redesigning the landscape 11 acres of park space with museum terraces. Construction Construction prep began in January 2018. Hathaway Dinwiddie is the general contractor.http://www.lucasmuseumconstruction.org/ The site parking lots were cleared and excavation work on the underground parking has begun.

NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 beta subcomplex, 3, 12kDa is an accessory subunit of the NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) complex, located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. It is also known as Complex I and is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain. Mutations in this gene contribute to mitochondrial complex I deficiency.  Structure  The NDUFB3 gene, located on the q arm of chromosome 2 in position 31.3, is 14,012 base pairs long. The NDUFB3 protein weighs 11.4 kDa and is composed of 98 amino acids. NDUFB3 is a subunit of the enzyme NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), the largest of the respiratory complexes. The structure is L-shaped with a long, hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic domain for the peripheral arm that includes all the known redox centers and the NADH binding site. NDUFB3 is one of about 31 hydrophobic subunits that form the transmembrane region of Complex I. This protein localizes to the inner membrane of the mitochondrion as a single-pass membrane protein. It has been noted that the N-terminal hydrophobic domain has the potential to be folded into an alpha helix spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane with a C-terminal hydrophilic domain interacting with globular subunits of Complex I. The highly conserved two-domain structure suggests that this feature is critical for the protein function and that the hydrophobic domain acts as an anchor for the NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) complex at the inner mitochondrial membrane.  Function  The human NDUFB3 gene codes for a subunit of Complex I of the respiratory chain, which transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. However, NDUFB3 is an accessory subunit of the complex that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Initially, NADH binds to Complex I and transfers two electrons to the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) prosthetic arm to form FMNH2. The electrons are transferred through a series of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in the prosthetic arm and finally to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ), which is reduced to ubiquinol (CoQH2). The flow of electrons changes the redox state of the protein, resulting in a conformational change and pK shift of the ionizable side chain, which pumps four hydrogen ions out of the mitochondrial matrix.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the NDUFB3 gene have been implicated in the pathogenicity of human oxidative phosphorylation disease, characterized by a biochemical defect in the respiratory chain.

Pinkas Bendin. 1905 ‚Äì June 1943) was the head of the Jewish Community Council, or Judenrat, in the Sosnowiec Ghetto during the Nazi German occupation of Poland in World War II. It is believed that he perished in the Auschwitz concentration camp.Yad Vashem, Moniek (Moshe) Merin, The Central Database of Shoah Victims' Names. Automatic translation from Hebrew. Item ID: 3968401\\\\. Submitted by Sara Khana Unger Kleiner. As with most Jewish Council leadership of the time, his actions or lack thereof during the Holocaust in occupied Poland are highly controversial. Life Moniek Merin was born in Sosnowiec (Sosnovitz) in the Prussian Partition, at the border with Austria-Hungary. He was married twice and divorced. His teenage daughter from the marriage to Marysia (Mania) Gancwajch, Halinka Merin, survived the Holocaust according to USHMM records,USHMM (2003), Halinka Merin (daughter of Zaglebie Council chairman Moniek Merin), 1946. Jewish DPs in 1945. Bayreuth, Bavaria. saved by a Polish farmer, name unknown.USHMM (2015), Mania Ganzweich in Auschwitz. On January 18, 1945, Mania and her daughter Halina were sent on a forced march to Ravensbruck, Malchow, and Taucha. Both survived, and emigrated to the United States in 1947. Merin made his living by trading goods before the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland. He was described by others as an unstable and impulsive man. Moshe Merin at Yad Vashem (in Hebrew) PDF. =World War II= After the German takeover of Sosnowiec on September 4, 1939, Merin presented himself to the Nazis as head of the Sosnowiec Community Council, when the former president (from before the invasion of Poland), Lejzerowicz, remained silent in a meeting with the German officers. Merin reported from behind the last row of community members subjected to a 24-hour detention in a public bath.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation. New York: Macmillan, p. 26. . It remains unclear whether or not he was on the pre-war council; his advance rested on the fact that he could speak the German language.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat. Macmillan, 353; citing G.Z., No. 47 (Dec. 31, 1940); No. 1 (Jan. 3, 1941); Pawe≈Ç Wiederman, op.cit., p. 208. Such was the beginning of his career as chairman of the Judenrat in the Sosnowiec Ghetto and the adjacent Bƒôdzin Ghetto forming a single administrative unit. =Consolidation of power= In January 1940, Merin was installed by the Nazis as leader of the Central Office of the Jewish Council of Elders in East Upper Silesia (),Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat. Macmillan, 26; citing Ph. Friedman, op. cit., Bitzaron, No. 5, p. 30; Pawe≈Ç Wiederman, op. cit., pp. 45-47. responsible for some 45 Jewish communities of approximately 100,000 Polish Jews. Within a year, he controlled dozens of Judenr√§te. Merin is noted to have been very harsh in his dealings with the Jewish groups opposing occupation including Hanoar Hazioni, Hashomer Hatzair, Gordonia, Poalei Zion, and Hitachdut. Merin aided the Nazis in the hunt for the leaders of the aforementioned groups, going so far as to place a request for their arrest and signing their execution orders himself.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat. Macmillan, 459; citing Pinkos Bendin, pp. 355-357 (facsimile of Merin‚Äôs letter to Bezdin Council); Fredke Mazia, Rayim besaar (Jerusalem, 1964), pp. 112-114. He did this with full cooperation of the Jewish Police Force, whose leader fervently defended Merin‚Äôs every decision.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat. Macmillan, 582-583. Merin's approach was similar to that of Chaim Rumkowski's, Juden√§lteste of the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto, in that he was convinced that by tying the Jews in his ghettos to forced labor, some would survive the war. However, Merin engaged in extortions going far beyond what other ghetto leaders would ever attempt. On one occasion, Merin requested 15,000 zloty of ransom for each of the 100 prisoners he promised to free from the deadly slave labour. The amount was three-hundred-times higher than the highest similar ransom collected in the Lublin Ghetto. None of the Jews were released, and the money was never refunded.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat. Macmillan, 243. Like Rumkowski, Merin attempted to make justifications for the 25,000 Jews he helped to deport by claiming that their sacrifice enabled the survival of those who remained as he stated: \\"If I have lost only 25 percent when I could have lost all, who can wish better results?\\" It is because of his insistence on fulfilling every German request that Merin has been depicted as a Nazi collaborator.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat. Macmillan, 422-425; citing Wiederman, op. cit., p. 25 and passim; according to Wiederman, Merin tried to justify his strategy at a meeting with Rumkowski and Czernikow, held in Warsaw on an unknown date (ibid., pp. 89-90); there is no record left of the meeting. Merin reconfigured the leadership of his councils by expelling those who opposed his methods, and by appointing Jews loyal only to him, including his brother-in-law and a notorious criminal, Abraham Gancwajch, to carry out further Nazi orders in Sosnowiec and its surrounding area.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat. Macmillan, 36; citing Sefer Khzhanev, pp. 255-256, 283-285. In spite of his full cooperation with the Nazis, Merin was sent to Auschwitz- Birkenau in June 1943, one month before the last Holocaust transport left the Sosnowiec Ghetto.

The earthquake has been estimated at 7.9 to 8.3 on the moment magnitude scale. Background The Tsetserleg earthquake is believed to be a strike-slip rupture of a branch of the Bolnai Fault, extending about 190 km. The fault displacement during the earthquake was greater than 5 m, and the duration is estimated at about one minute. However, this interpretation is contested; field surveys after the earthquake show a complex rupture not necessarily characteristic of a strike- slip mechanism. The Tsetserleg earthquake was followed two weeks later by the Bolnai earthquake, and is considered a part of the same general crustal movement.

A promotional flyer supporting women's suffrage (c.1914) The Justice Bell (The Women's Liberty Bell) is a replica of the Liberty Bell made in 1915. It was created to promote the cause for women's suffrage in the United States from 1915 to 1920. The bell is on permanent display at the Washington Memorial Chapel in Valley Forge National Park in Pennsylvania.  Casting and design  The Justice Bell was commissioned by suffragist Katherine Wentworth Ruschenberger in 1915 and was cast by the Meneely Bell Foundry in Troy, New York. The Justice Bell is a replica of the Liberty Bell, with a few minor design differences. The Justice Bell does not have a crack, and the words, \\"establish JUSTICE\\" were added on the top line of the inscription. Also, the Liberty Bell was cast in London, and the Justice Bell was cast in Troy, New York. The inscription on the Justice Bell reads: > establish JUSTICE Proclaim LIBERTY Throughout all the Land unto all the > Inhabitants Thereof Meneeley Bell Co Troy, NY MCMXV Suffrage awareness tours and the 19th Amendment In an effort to raise awareness for women's suffrage, the bell went on a 5,000-mile tour in 1915, visiting all 67 Pennsylvania counties, on the bed of a modified pickup truck. The bell's clapper was chained to its side as a symbol of how women were being silenced by being unable to vote. The truck carried a sign with the slogan of the suffragist moment: \\"Votes for Women\\", a phrase coined by Mark Twain as the title of his famous speech in 1901. Flyers stating the tour's mission were handed out to spectators. An excerpt reads: > The Woman's Liberty Bell - \\"Liberty throughout the land to all the > inhabitants thereof\\" was the message of The Liberty Bell of 1776.

The reception was particularly notable in large cities such as New York City and Philadelphia. On October 22, 1915, the bell was welcomed to Philadelphia, joining in a parade of 8000 people, witnessed by a crowd of 100,000 people. Anna Howard Shaw's Yellow Suffrage automobile also appeared in the procession. The parade on Broad Street led to a ceremony held at the Academy of Music, which was attended by many dignitaries. The bell also traveled to other states in 1920 to raise awareness for the 19th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which would give women the right to vote. The Justice Bell was taken to the first national convention of the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (National Women's Party) in Washington, D.C. It was also present at the national suffrage convention in Chicago. The 19th Amendment was ratified on August 18, 1920. The Justice Bell was sounded at a celebration ceremony led by Katherine Wentworth Ruschenberger was held on Independence Square, behind Independence Hall in Philadelphia on September 25, 1920. Ruschenberger's niece, Katharine Wentworth, released the Justice Bell from silence before a large crowd that had gathered on the south side of Independence Hall. Two of Susan B. Anthony's nieces were among the many dignitaries in attendance. The bell rang 48 times, once for every state in the union at that time.  Post 19th Amendment  * Beginning in 1920, the Justice Bell has been stored on the grounds of Valley Forge National Park, after being denied a permanent installation on Independence Mall. Beginning in 1943, per Katherine Wentworth Ruschenberger's will, the Justice Bell permanently resides in the chamber of the National Patriots Bell Tower at the Washington Memorial Chapel in Valley Forge National Park. * In April 1995, in honor of the 75th anniversary of the League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania, the Justice Bell traveled again. It was displayed in the rotunda of the Pennsylvania State Capitol building in Harrisburg for a week and then at the State Museum of Pennsylvania, before embarking on a yearlong anniversary tour of Pennsylvania. On August 22, 1996, the Justice Bell returned to Washington Memorial Chapel, where it remains on public exhibition. * In 2015, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the Justice Bell, Independence National Historical Park unveiled an exhibit titled \\"Independence Hall & Votes for Women\\" in the Liberty Bell Center, located on Independence Mall. * On September 13, 2015, during a celebration of its 100th anniversary held at the Washington Memorial Chapel, the Justice Bell was ceremoniously rung and its clapper was symbolically unchained.

In the television series, he is the son of Deanna and Reg, and has a brother named Aiden. In the TV series, he fell in love with Rosita Espinosa and started a relationship with her after she broke up with Abraham, but shortly ended when Spencer was killed by Negan. AppearancesComic book series= Spencer Monroe is the son of Douglas and Regina, who lead Alexandria. At the dinner party hosted for the newcomers, Spencer bonds with Andrea, the group's primary sharpshooter. He appears very interested in her change from being a clerk in a lawyer's office to an excellent marksman. He insists she should show a demonstration of her shooting skills. Andrea appears less interested, and is shown shocked to discover Spencer is Douglas' son (who flirted with her upon Andrea's group's arrival). Spencer eventually invites Andrea over for dinner where she says that she is not interested in a relationship at the moment. When the herd attacks the Safe-Zone and Andrea is trapped in the clock tower, Spencer joins Heath and Glenn to try and bring her supplies. The four of them become stranded on a rooftop outside of the wall and contemplate how they can help the rest of the Safe-Zone residents. Spencer suggests that he and Andrea leave everyone (including his own father) and go off on their own. Andrea is shocked by his cowardice and responds to his suggestion by punching him and declaring \\"That's about the end of you and me.\\" Andrea is disgusted by Spencer's behavior and does not accept his apologies in rekindling their relationship. When Andrea tells him that there was nothing between them, he soon becomes the co-conspirator in Rick Grimes' assassination attempt, which is quickly ended.

While Rick is at The Kingdom meeting with King Ezekiel, Negan stops by at the Alexandria Safe Zone. He is told that Rick is busy gathering supplies, so Negan decides to rest at one of the vacant houses. Spencer approaches Negan and tells him that Rick isn't fit to be the leader and that he should be killed. Negan requests that Spencer walk with him so they could talk about Rick. Negan then proceeds to talk about how Rick is out gathering supplies so that he wouldn't hurt anyone while Spencer waited until Rick was gone so he could talk to him and told him to do his dirty work, and that he has no guts.

B. Leakey in 1960. It is believed to be ca. 1.4 million years old. Its cranial capacity is estimated at than , the largest value among all known African Homo erectus specimens.Robert Jurmain, Lynn Kilgore, Wenda Trevathan, Essentials of Physical Anthropology (2008), p. 201 OH 9 is significant because the features it carried and its correlation to the species classification it resides in. OH 9 allowed anthropologist to explore the cranium of H. erectus and the debate as to whether it should be classified as H. erectus or not.  Species Classification  Leakey named it \\"Chellean Man\\", in reference to the Oldowan tools found at the site, which were then referred to by the now-obsolete name Chellean. Heberer (1963) provisionally named a new species Homo leakeyi based on the specimen in honor of Leakey, but most subsequent workers have regarded it as Homo ergaster, or as Homo erectus (H. ergaster is sometimes regarded as a junior synonym of H. erectus, possibly denoting an African subspecies, H. e. ergaster). Phillip Tobias provisionally named a new subspecies, H. erectus olduvaiensis, in 1968 based on the specimen, but this has not seen continued use. To the extent that proponents of the use of H. ergaster define ergaster as a separate lineage, equivalent to \\"African H. erectus\\", rather than a pure chronospecies, the assignment of OH 9 to H. erectus sensu stricto by Colin Groves supports subsuming H. ergaster into H. erectus. Cranial bone thickness has been widely qualified for Homo erectus but rarely quantified. It‚Äôs quite often that throughout craniums found, the thickness varies between those different hominids. Yet in OH 9, compared to other H. erectus, it had the biggest cranial capacity standing at 1,067 cc and one of the largest mid supra-orbital torus thickness of 18.5 mm also known as the brow ridge. OH 9 has a robust brow ridge that allows it to stand out among other H. erectus. The brow ridge made it difficult to determine whether this cranium should be classified as H. erectus or a different species. However it has been determined that this skull was that of an h. erectus. Cranial bone thickness is key when determining whether a specimen found is H. erectus. The pattern of bone thickness distribution observed in Asian H. erectus, P. paniscus, and possibly in the australopiths, early Homo or African H. ergaster/erectus analyzed appears to be a pleomorphic trait among hominids. Since cranium thickness and the OH 9 cranium capacity is larger than any found, it explored the idea of different forms of H. erectus from different areas due to migration. By the 1980's, the growing numbers of H. erectus specimens, particularly in Africa, led to the realization that Asian Homo erectus (H. erectus sensu stricto), once thought so primitive, was in fact more derived than its African counter-parts, which leads into the Out of Africa hypothesis that many homo species were believed to be a part of.  Cranial Features  The significant features of the OH 9 also consisted of the structure of the skull. O.H. 9 had a flatter frontal squama curving not as steep from a broader supratoral shelf. Also, O.H. 9 showed no sign of keeling in the midline, which was often found in H. erectus especially with a protruding brow ridge. The occipital torus thickness also known as the occipital bun which is the back of the head was also fairly thick compared to most H. erectus with a thickness of 18.5 mm. OH 9 being the largest cranium capacity, helped us learn the increase of brain growth in H. erectus. Which implied that major differences in the development of cognitive capabilities existed between H. erectus and anatomically modern humans. These new traits like the robust brow ridge and skull thickness confirmed that H. erectus in different areas kept evolving. In the same site, the oldowan tools found could be assumed to have been used by this exact H. erectus. This allowed anthropologist to understand how advanced this unique H. erectus cognitive behavior truly was.

Society was founded in 1887 at the University of Virginia as a secret society devoted to the literary arts. Founded two years prior to the Thirteen Society and T.I.L.K.A., both founded in 1889, the O.W.L. Society can claim to be the oldest secret society existing at the University today, though it has not been in continuous existence since its founding. Founding and early history The original O.W.L. Society appears to have been a primarily social group of influential University students. Among the Society's founders was Thomas Longstreet Wood, a student active in literary pursuits, who later went on to publish Arcade Echoes, a compilation of the best student writing during his time at the University. Mr. Wood died at a young age soon after graduation. It was classified as a ribbon society, similar to Eli Banana and T.I.L.K.A., with which it shared a substantial number of common members. The O.W.L. also included many members of prominent fraternities, such as Delta Kappa Epsilon, in its ranks. Eli Banana and T.I.L.K.A. dominated University social and political affairs at the time, and also drew their membership from the fraternities, giving us a good indication of the Society's importance in the University community. The O.W.L. was accordingly regarded in fairly high respect, and definitely as a ‚Äúgood thing,‚Äù as the students of the day called something they approved of. Of the ribbon societies, the 1895 edition of the University's annual, Corks and Curls, ranked the O.W.L. just below Eli Banana and T.I.L.K.A. in terms of social prominence, and highly in terms of academic performance. The O.W.L. published its membership in Corks and Curls, but its proceedings, membership selection, and other activities were held secret. The Society operated on a single ball system in membership proceedings, that is, one vote in the negative from any member was sufficient to exclude a candidate from the Society. The Society remained small, never including more than eight members at one time. The pages of Corks and Curls also give us two mottos, one Latin and one French. In Latin,‚ÄúDe mortuis nil nisi bonum‚Äù is translated as ‚ÄúNothing but good about things past‚Äù or ‚ÄúOf the dead, nothing unless good.‚Äù In French,‚ÄúLa nuit porte conseil‚Äù is translated as ‚ÄúThe night brings sound counsel.‚Äù Though its specific activities remain unknown, it can be reasonably assumed that the O.W.L. served to support the University's burgeoning literary scene, which at the time included College Topics, the Virginia University Magazine, Corks and Curls, and numerous minor student publications, many of which were founded within just a few years of the O.W.L. These literary institutions, particularly a student newspaper, were hallmarks of an expanding University, which was growing both in terms of size and prestige. On January 19, 1894, seven years after its founding, the O.W.L was re-organized: ‚ÄúIn order to promote the literary spirit not merely in a narrow circle but in the whole College, the constitution was amended and the qualification for membership made honorary.‚Äù The Society was transformed from a purely social organization to one with both social and practical functions. Its membership was now drawn from the ranks of editors of important University publications including the Virginia University Magazine, College Topics, and Corks and Curls. This reconstituted organization likely served as a forum to bring student literary leaders together with the goals of improving and promoting their respective publications. As is the case today, early University literary endeavors sometimes struggled with low readership, small numbers of subscriptions, and the corresponding challenging financial situations. Membership in the O.W.L. would have allowed the leaders of these organizations to engage and collaborate, share best practices, and assist each other in the often-arduous task of managing a student publication. At the same time, the Society would have built and strengthened friendships among these students outside of their professional capacities. Dissolution and re-founding The O.W.L. began to fade from University life in the early 1920s. The Society appeared in Corks and Curls for the final time in 1921, and it appears likely that the second iteration of the organization dissolved around this time. Several brief attempts were made to revive the O.W.L. throughout the 1920s as a purely functional organization. In 1923, College Topics recorded that the O.W.L. ‚Äúreorganized‚Äù and merged with Sigma Delta Chi, formerly the University's chapter of the national journalistic fraternity. Topics noted that the new organization would ‚Äú[act] as an unofficial group of students interested in student publications, gathered for the purpose of encouraging all journalistic activities at the University of Virginia.‚Äù In 1928, the O.W.L. was again resurrected, this time with the purpose of sponsoring the satirical student publication known as The Yellow Journal, which was then facing considerable criticism from faculty and students alike for its practice of anonymous publication. During the years 1929 and 1930, the masthead of the Yellow Journal read, in part, ‚ÄúSponsored by the OWLS (the damned fools).‚Äù After 1930, the O.W.L. was no longer mentioned in the masthead, and the Journal ceased publication entirely in 1934. It is almost certain that the O.W.L., if it had not folded already, ceased to exist at this point. The exact reason for the O.W.L.‚Äôs disappearance remains unclear, although numerous theories abound. One such rationale, published in the Cavalier Daily in 1968, asserts that the O.W.L. may have become what is now known as the Seven Society. The article suggests that the members of the O.W.L., taking to heart University President Edwin Alderman‚Äôs admonition that a more ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù secret society be formed on Grounds, began taking action in greater secrecy under a new title. As the new organization gained prominence, the O.W.L. gradually became less relevant and was discontinued. The Seven Society's first public announcement, in 1915, coincided with the O.W.L.‚Äôs changing its heading in Corks and Curls from a secret society to a club. (Corks and Curls, however, frequently changed the internal organization of its pages from issue to issue.) Though interesting to consider, no hard evidence is known to exist to support this theory. More likely, perhaps, is that a combination of student apathy, increasing pressure from other social organizations, and financial hardship brought on by the Great Depression combined to cause the Society‚Äôs collapse. No further iterations of the O.W.L. Society are known to have existed between its closure in the 1930s and its refounding in 2013. The O.W.L. announced its reorganization through a letter in the Cavalier Daily on October 19, 2013, saying \\"We resurrect the O.W.L. to support, cultivate and enrich literary culture at the University of Virginia.\\" Notable members Notable members of the O.W.L. Society included James Rogers McConnell, in his capacity as Editor-in-Chief of the 1910 Corks and Curls. McConnell is yet another auspicious University student who died at a young age after being shot down by German fighters over Flavy-le-Martel, France during World War I. He is commemorated by the University in the Aviator statue that stands by Alderman Library. Other notable members of the O.W.L. included: * Senator Oscar Underwood, Senate Minority Leader, House Majority Leader * Ambassador Hugh S. Cumming, Jr. * Congressman John W.

Founded in 2012, it delivers the most current questions to provide users with the best available board review, in a web application. The test questions are peer-reviewed by medical practitioners to guarantee the most relevant preparation for users. The exam provides user feedback on how they compare to their peers overall on a test and how they compared on specific questions. BoardVitals boasts a pass rate among its users as much as ten percent higher than the national average. Based in New York City, BoardVitals was the recent winner of the 2014 Gust Catapult NYC venture capital competition for start-ups in the area, providing the firm with further venture capital and angel investing opportunities. Founding BoardVitals was founded in 2012 by Dr. Andrea Paul and Dan Lambert. Dr. Paul is a graduate of Michigan State medical school, and a former resident at Yale medical school and Mt. Sinai Hospital. She has stated that among her motivations for the company was the disorganization she experienced while studying for medical board exams. In an interview with Entrepreneur Magazine, she remembered when she ‚Äúwas preparing for [her] own boards, [she] was putting together things from other books and notes that were not up to date.‚Äù She critiqued the lack of any standardized preparation or review and therefore sought to make a dynamic change. Dr. Paul left her Yale residency program to team up with several medical educators. She partnered with Harvard Business School graduate and software developer Dan Lambert in 2012 to head Board Vitals as its CEO. Lambert was formerly a co-founder and CTO at Pushpins, which was acquired by Ebates in 2013. Business structure After its founding in 2012, BoardVitals has undergone several rounds of financing. In January 2014 it received a $500k seed investment from venture capital firms Rothenberg Ventures and Accelerator Blueprint Health. In February 2014, BoardVitals entered the Gust Catapult NYC startup contest sponsored by entrepreneur and investor David S. Rose. The contest creates a platform for startups to pitch their business plan to a series of angel investors and venture capitalists. BoardVitals was selected as the winner of the competition out of over two hundred candidates. It was then invited to spend three months in a Silicon Alley incubator under the tutelage of Rose. BoardVitals has drawn the attention of several major investment groups. Its clients include Harvard medical school, Yale medical school, and the Veterans Health Administration. In addition it has partnerships with several medical publishers, including McGraw-Hill, Wolters Kluwer Health, and Wiley Publishers. The business model focuses on aggregating questions and answers from Publishers, Universities, and individually contributing physicians in a single location. Test preparation Medical practitioners often continue their education after medical school by completing a residency in a specialty field to become a medical specialist. To complete their certification, the practitioner is required to pass a board certification exam to illustrate mastery of knowledge. Traditionally, there has been no standard review for these tests and study often includes outdated material. In addition, traditional review often requires multiple sources such as textbooks, lecture notes, and journals that can become costly and tedious. In recent years there has been a decline in pass rates among board certifications. BoardVitals offers comprehensive test preparation for several specialty fields available on any electronic device. The material is taken from top medical universities, publishers and individually practicing physicians and compiled into a review database that can be accessed anytime from any number of mobile devices. It also only provides the most up-to-date medical knowledge in its curriculum, making sure its users never review obsolete material. Other material is sourced from top medical journals and texts in each specialty. Questions are written by faculty from top institutions and by several physician contributors. These questions are voted up or down through crowdsourcing among users to determine which questions more accurately reflect the specific specialty exam. This also ensures that out of date content is removed. Its board review programs are offered to individuals as well as medical schools, residency programs, teaching hospitals, and other medical facilities, both in the United States and abroad. It currently offers test reviews and questions for sixteen specialty fields: * Cardiology * Child Psychiatry * Dermatology * Echocardiography * Emergency Medicine * ENT * Family Medicine * Gastroenterology * Internal Medicine * Neurology * OBGYN * Pathology * Pediatrics * Podiatry * Psychiatry * Radiology * Surgery Dr. Paul has stated the company plans to expand this to many more fields in the coming years. Each exam and question offers users feedback on their performance. It indicates where they stand in comparison to their peers, including data about what other users answered on a particular question. The statistics give users an accurate review of their performance in each section. User can customize practice tests to suit their exact needs, with advanced statistics available to offer premier test review. Board Vitals has given a guarantee that users will pass their board review. Reception Dr. Paul was recently named among the top ten disruptive women in healthcare startups. Gust.com named Board Vitals the 'Most Promising' startup in New York. The company has been featured in business profiles by several newspapers including CNN, Forbes, and Fox News. Board Vitals has been used by over 100,000 clinicians for board certification preparation and continuing education.

On an average the crew participates in over 100 activities, provides over 50 hours of community service, and spends over 85 days underway in a given year.Rogers, Tom, unknown, Charles N. Curtis ‚Äì Sea Scout Ship 110, Some of their activities include the Daffodil Marine Parade, Seattle's Yacht Club Opening Day, the Wooden Boat Show in Olympia, the Special People Cruise, and the Tacoma lighted Boat Parade to name a few.Rogers, Tom, unknown, The Charles N. Curtis Sea Scout Ship 110, Personnel The Curtis has several licensed captains and mates which consist of adult volunteers to help train and guide the youth of tomorrow. The organization is youth led. The crew have several leadership positions within their ranks. They include the Boatswain, Deck Crew Leader, Engine Crew Leader, Navigation Crew Leader, and Yeoman. The youth assigned to these positions are responsible for developing training plans and goals for the program. They coordinate with adult leaders to ensure available training resources. The youth that participate in the program learn valuable skills while operating the boat. While on the boat they are assigned to different crews based on their knowledge and experience. Senior Crew: Senior crew are the youth that have been in the program for several years and have developed the skills, knowledge, and are capable of teaching the younger scouts those skills. Most of the senior crew, have graduated from high school and are in college. Boatswain: Lead all crew. The deck crew leader, engine crew leader, navigation crew leader, and yeoman report to the boatswain. The Boatswain in turn reports to the skipper. The Boatswain conducts the quarterdeck meetings, knows the needs of the ship and crew and appoints crew to head committees for activities. The boat can be maneuvered with as little as three people, a skipper, an engineer, and a deck crew. However, that is not an easy task with only 3 people. Ideally the Curtis can operate with seven people during a charter. There should always be one captain on board, but two is preferred especially for overnight cruises.Boy Scouts of America, 2012, Sea Scout Manuel, page 13, http://seascout.org/component/edocman/?task=document.viewdoc&id;=37&Itemid;= Deck Crew: This crew is the crew responsible for handling the lines when the boat is preparing for getting underway or while docking. They also perform various watches while the boat is underway. These watches are Stern, log and helm duties. When they are not performing these duties they are responsible for keeping the deck clean. Engine Crew: The engine crew is responsible for the two 6-71 diesel engines and the two generators that are on board. They also assist with the maintenance of the water, fuel, electrical and sewer functions on the boat. This crew monitors the engines while underway and is responsible to answer the telegraph. The telegraph is how the captain relays information to the engine room telling the engine crew what speed to operate the boat at. Navigation Crew: This crew is responsible for monitoring radio communications and plotting courses for the boat. They maintain logs of when and where the boat is going, check in with marine traffic by radio, and keep a record of who is on the boat. Rank Advancement The youth on the Charles N. Curtis work on achieving rank advancement. The ranks are Apprentice, Ordinary, Able, and Quartermaster Award (Boy Scouts of America). The Quartermaster rank is the highest rank you can earn while in Sea Scouts, unlike Boy Scouts the program is coed and is for 14 to 21 year olds. The kids are awarded their rank at a ceremony which is called a Bridge of Honor once a year. They are also awarded badges for long cruise, swimming, areas in which they specialize, scholarships, and Boatswain of the Year.Boy Scouts of America, 2012, Sea Scout Manuel, page 49-59, http://seascout.org/component/edocman/?task=document.viewdoc&id;=37&Itemid;=  See also  * S.S.S.

She was a member of Canada's women's sevens team that were runners-up at the 2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens in Russia. Kish captained the sevens squad from 2012-2016 until she left the centralized program and while still player, she was replaced by Ghislaine Landry. She is known for her aerial skills and defence (and her ink). Kish was awarded the Most Influential Athlete of the CAAWS Most Influential Women List of 2016. Rugby 15s Kish's dream of being an elite athlete started at an early age and in Grade 2, she put down \\"professional athlete\\" as her future profession Kish started rugby in Grade 10 at W. P. Wagner High School in Edmonton because her football coach was a rugby player and suggested she should try the sport. Kish typically played flanker and occasionally 8-man. Playing for the province of Alberta at 16, her skills were recognized and she joined the U-19 Team Canada roster. Six months later, at 17, before joining the senior women's team, Kish tattooed the Rugby Canada logo on her right calf. She would go on to play in three Nations Cups and the 2010 Women's Rugby World Cup. Rugby 7s Kish tried out for the sevens team in 2007, but she thought the sport was hard because it involved a lot of sprinting and differed too much from 15s. After the 2010 World Cup, John Tait invited Kish to a sevens camp. In 2013, Kish captained Canada to silver at the 2013 Women's Rugby World Cup. Her stellar performance was awarded when she was named the 2013 Sevens Player of the Year, for the second year in a row. Kish won a gold medal at the 2015 Pan American Games as a member of the Canadian women's rugby sevens team. In 2016, she was named to Canada's first ever women's rugby sevens Olympic team, which won the bronze medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Her favourite pre-match tune is \\"Watch Me Rise\\" by Mikka Ekko. Her pregame rituals consist of eating mustard before every game and writing what's important to her on her wrists, particularly \\"#ruckcancer\\", in honour of her father Steve, a cancer survivor. Kish announced her retirement on April 30, 2018, due to injuries that forced her to miss the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia and recent Canadian appearances on the Sevens world circuit. Upon the end of her sevens career, Kish played in 134 matches and scored 170 points (34 tries). In 2019, Kish was on the World Rugby Men's Sevens Player of the Year award and the World Rugby Women's Sevens Player of the Year award voting panels. Personal Kish is openly lesbian. During May 2018, Kish was part of a group of four female athletes, including Cassie Campbell, Fran Rider and Kerrin Lee-Gartner to publicly pledge their brain to a Canadian research centre. The posthumous donation shall be made to Toronto Western Hospital's Canadian Concussion Centre to further research on the effect of trauma on women's brains.

Earlyt years and education Maria Leer was born in 1788 in Edam, the daughter of Pieter Jansse Leer (originally from Holstein) and Anna Geertruy Gunthers (from Quakenbr√ºck), both German Lutherans. She was the fifth of six children, and her father and mother died when she was a child. She grew up in the orphanage for poor children in Edam and received some schooling to prepare her for a position as a domestic servant. Career She worked briefly as a maid with a Catholic family, but lost her position for trying to convert them. She later became a seamstress in Amsterdam, and there she came into contact with Stoffel Muller, a barge skipper. In 1816, they founded Zwijndrechtse nieuwlichters with the help of a Waddinxveen bailiff, Dirk Valk. The income-pooling community aimed to \\"revive the apostolic communism practiced at the beginning of the Christian era\\". With Muller, she engaged in a \\"spiritual marriage\\". The religion held property communally and refused to accept the authority of the civil government. While Muller was considered the group's leader, he was not formally appointed as such. The group earned a living by making and selling matchsticks and was thus nicknamed the \\"sulfur sticks faith.\\" At the same time, they tried to spread their faith. Because they rejected civil government they frequently faced resistance from local government. Around 1820, that led to a prison sentence for Leer, who also spent a year in the women's prison in St. George Hospital in Dordrecht. In 1823, the brotherhood became more regulated, and Valk went his own way after that. In 1829, the group settled in Zwijndrecht, where they bought a shipyard and tried there to realize their ideals of a Christian commune. After the death of Muller in 1833, Leer tried to continue his work. But her radical views on freedom of marriage and the common property were shared by fewer and fewer members of the church. In 1843, the community was abolished and Leer moved in with her daughter Josina in Rotterdam. After Josina died in 1848, Leer found shelter with friends, and helped the sick and invalid with homemade medicine. In 1858, she moved to Leiden, where she ran a shop. From 1860, she lived in the Bethlehemhof in Leiden, where she was able to buy a house from the proceeds of the sale of the community's possession. A continued intellectual curiosity sustained her even after her banker lost her pension. At that time, she met the writer Louise Sophie Bluss√©, who chronicled Leer's memoirs and published them in 1892 under the pseudonym D.N. Anagrapheus. Leer died in July 1866 at the age of 78 from cholera in Leiden. ReferencesFurther reading * Marang, G.P. Leer, Maria in: Nieuw Nederlandsch Biografisch Woordenboek * Jansen, D.

It is a memorial to victims of political repression. Niyaz Azizovich Yalymov, head of the Tolyatti organization Victims of Political Repression proposed in 1999 that such a memorial be constructed. In 2000 a design competition was held. Of five finalists, the entry of Igor Burmistenko was accepted. The statue was installed on the Veteran's Mall of Tolyatti Central Park and was opened on October 30 (the Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Political Repressions), 2005. The bronze figure was not yet ready, so a temporary plaster version was installed for the opening, then removed. The bronze statue was installed in April 2006. Total cost for creation of the monument was 8 million rubles, shared by the regional and city governments. The sculptor, Igor Burmistenko, a member of the Union of Artists of the Russian Federation (and before that of the USSR Union of Artists) died five years into the project, and the statue was finished by the project architect I. N. Prokopenko and cast in bronze by V. A. Fomin. The memorial complex is a square with granite panels around the perimeter. At one side is the bronze figure of the sitting angle, tall, on a granite pedestal, head slightly bowed. In the hands of the angel are an open book inscribed with words from Ecclesiastes 3:5, \\"A Time to Gather Stones\\". On the wall behind the angel are two granite slabs. On one are excerpts from the Constitution of the Russian Federation and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations. The other lists the name of 171 residents of the area who were sentenced to death for political reasons and later rehabilitated. The memorial after the Tolyatti bus bombing In January 2007, the memorial complex was attacked by teenaged hooligans who smashed lights and damaged lamposts. The damage was not soon repaired, and maintenance of the monument lagged in general. The monument is also used by miscreants as a venue for skateboarding stunts. The sculpture acquired a new symbolism after the Tolyatti bus bombing of 2007 (eight killed, 56 injured), which occurred on October 31, the morning after the Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Political Repressions. The actual site of the bombing was closed for forensic investigation, so grieving citizens gathered at the Mourning Angel (near the site of the bombing) and lit candles.

This fort is an important fort in Pune district. The fort restoration is done by the Shree Shivdurga Samvardhan committeehttp://shivdurg.org/ with the help of forest dept. and local villagers. History This fort was built during Yadava period. According to the inscription on the third gate, Mohammed Adil Shah of Bijapur had repaired this fort on May 1656. Shivaji Maharaj won the fort from the hands of Bandal- Deshmukh of Rohida in a close battle. The conflict resulted in the death of Krishnaji Bandal. After the battle, many officials along with Bajiprabhu Deshpande, a chief administrator of Bandals, were inducted into Swarajya movement. Rohida was among the 23 forts Shivaji handed over to Mughals ( to Aurangzeb Alamgir) during the Treaty of Purandar (1665). On 24 June 1670 this fort was again captured by Shivaji Maharaj. The Kanhoji Jedhe had patronage over the entire Bhor state and half of the Rohida Fort along with some patches of land. Further Moghuls captured this fort. This fort was under the control of Pantsachiv of Bhor State,till the Indian independence.http://trekshitiz.com/trekshitiz/Ei/Rohida-Trek-R-Alpha.html How to reach The nearest town is Bhor which is 61 km from Pune.

In 1783 he enlisted in the French Royal Army. In 1792 he joined a volunteer battalion and fought at Valmy, earning promotion to major. After leading a battalion at Wattignies and successfully holding Philippeville in 1793, he became a general of brigade. In 1794, he led troops in the Army of the Ardennes at Boussu-lez-Walcourt, Grandreng, Gosselies and Fleurus. Hardy fought in the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse during the Rhine Campaign of 1795. He commanded 12,000 troops in the Rhine Campaign of 1796. In 1798 he was captured by the British at the Battle of Tory Island in a failed invasion of Ireland. In July 1799 Hardy was promoted general of division. He was wounded at Ampfing in late 1800. He was sent with the French expedition to put down the Haitian Revolution and died of yellow fever. His surname is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 6. War of the First Coalition Hardy was born on 19 May 1762 in Mouzon, a village that is now in the Ardennes department of France. He enlisted in an infantry unit at age 21. At the time of the French Revolution, he was a fourrier in the Royal-Monsieur Regiment with the brevet rank of sous-officer. He joined the Epernay Volunteers and fought at the Battle of Valmy on 20 September 1792, earning promotion to Chef de bataillon (major). He became the commander of the 7th Battalion of the Marne Volunteers, leading his unit at the Battle of Wattignies on 17 October 1793. In the following month he was assigned to hold Philippeville against the Austrians and his vigorous defense was crowned with success. Hardy was promoted general of brigade on 16 November 1793. Hardy was appointed commander of the advance guard of the Army of the Ardennes on 27 January 1794.Hardy (1901), p. x. This army was commanded by Louis Charbonnier. On 20 April, Charbonnier's superior Jean-Charles Pichegru ordered the Army of the Ardennes to march from Givet to Philippeville. By the 22nd, the army's 17,000 soldiers were massed west of Philippeville, less 3,450 men guarding the roads farther east. Philippe Joseph Jacob led 12 battalions grouped into a left brigade under Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge and a right brigade under Jean Baptiste Augier. Hardy was assigned an advance force made up of the 26th Light Infantry Battalion, six companies of grenadiers, the 11th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiment and four light cannons. His task was to cover the army's march toward Beaumont. Charbonnier decided to cross the Silenrieux gorge on 25 April and seize Boussu-lez-Walcourt.Dupuis (1907), pp. 44‚Äì45. Hardy's advance guard was reinforced with 172nd Line Infantry Demi-brigade, 1st Battalion of Sarthe, four companies of grenadiers, 20th Chasseurs √† Cheval, one squadron of the 5th Dragoons and six field guns. Led by the grenadiers and light infantry, Hardy's troops crossed the Silenrieux ravine and took position on the west side.Dupuis (1907), pp. 46‚Äì47. The local Austrian commander Joseph Binder von Degenschild decided to counterattack on the 26th from Boussu, Walcourt and Florennes.Dupuis (1907), p. 48. Having received positive orders to attack Boussu on the 26th, Charbonnier further reinforced Hardy with the 2nd Battalion of Nord, 9th Battalion of Seine-et-Oise and two more field pieces. Hardy now commanded 6,000 foot soldiers, 800 horsemen, eight cannons and four howitzers. In the area between Boussu and Beaumont there were only 5,000 Coalition troops, including 1,000 cavalry.Dupuis (1907), p. 50‚Äì51. During the action of 26 April, Hardy was personally in command of the troops engaged at Boussu.Dupuis (1907), p. 53 At the end of the day, Degenschild withdrew his Coalition forces to Thuin and Marchienne-au-Pont.Dupuis (1907), p. 56‚Äì57. Hardy led the advance guard in the capture of Thuin on 10 May in the lead-up to the Battle of Grandreng. On 3 June 1794, during the retreat after the Battle of Gosselies, Hardy with two battalions of light infantry defended the river crossing at Monceau-sur-Sambre. Under a crossfire of Austrian artillery, he and his troops held their ground until Alexandre-Antoine Hureau de S√©narmont and his engineers removed the last part of the pontoon bridge. During the Battle of Fleurus he led the advance guard in Fran√ßois S√©verin Marceau-Desgraviers' division. In the Rhine Campaign of 1795 Hardy commanded one of two brigades in Marceau's division which besieged Ehrenbreitstein Fortress. The units in his brigade were unspecified but the 11,240-strong division consisted of the 1st, 9th, 21st, 26th and 178th Line Infantry Demi- brigades, the 11th Chasseurs √† Cheval and the 31st Gendarmes Battalion. The siege lasted from 15 September to 17 October 1795 and was unsuccessful.Smith (1998), pp. 106‚Äì107 In July during the Rhine Campaign of 1796, Marceau was left to besiege Mainz with the 28,545 troops of the Right Wing and Infantry Reserve. Meanwhile, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan took the bulk of the Army of Sambre- et-Meuse into Germany in pursuit of the Austrian armies. Hardy's troops repulsed a sortie by the garrison of Mainz and he was cited in the order of the day for 29 July 1796. He commanded 12,000 troops on the west bank of the Rhine facing Mainz.Hardy (1901), p. xi. By September 1796, Jourdan's army was in retreat and Marceau was compelled to lift the siege of Mainz with his east bank forces and join Jourdan. At this time, Hardy withdrew his west bank division to the Nahe River.Phipps (2011), v. 2, pp. 353‚Äì354. Later, he fought several skirmishes in the Hunsr√ºck region, including at Ingelheim am Rhein, Bingen am Rhein and Kaiserslautern. On 27 November 1796 he was badly wounded at Mont-Tonnerre. After recuperating at Philippeville, Hardy married the 20-year-old Calixte Hufty de Busnel, S√©narmont's sister-in-law, on 18 January 1797.Hardy (1901), p. xiv. The couple would have three sons, Victor, Felix and √âdouard.Hardy (1901), pp. 289‚Äì290. The new commander of the Army of Sambre-et- Meuse, Lazare Hoche crossed the Rhine in April and Hardy rejoined the army. His private letters beginning on 30 April 1797 are preserved in a book edited by his grandson, General Hardy de P√©rini.Hardy (1901), p. 1. War of the Second Coalition On 16 December 1797, Jacques Maurice Hatry took command of the Army of Mainz which consisted of five infantry divisions under Hardy, Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre, Paul Grenier, Jean √âtienne Championnet and Jean Baptiste Olivier and a cavalry division under Michel Ney. At the time Hardy's division was stationed at Koblenz. By a secret clause of the Treaty of Campo Formio, the Austrians agreed that the city of Mainz, which belonged to the Elector of Mainz, was to be handed over to France. Accordingly, Hatry immediately assembled his divisions before the city and demanded its surrender. The city capitulated on 30 December. Soon after, the divisions of Hardy and Ney were reassigned to the Army of England. In the spring of 1798 he was called to Lille to command a division.Hardy (1901), p. 45. The Army of England briefly reached a strength of 100,000 men but by September 1798 its numbers had fallen to 30,000. On 2 June Hardy was at Colmar in Haut-Rhin department.Phipps (2011), v. 5, p. 14‚Äì15. Map of Ireland and Tory Island To support the Irish Rebellion of 1798 the French sent a naval expedition to Ireland that landed 1,099 soldiers under Jean Joseph Amable Humbert in August 1798. Unaware that Humbert was forced to surrender on 8 September, a second force of 2,844 troops under Hardy left for Ireland on 16 September. The naval squadron led by Jean-Baptiste-Fran√ßois Bompart was intercepted in the Battle of Tory Island and almost all of its ships captured, Hardy and most of his men becoming prisoners. He was exchanged in time to join the Army of the Danube in March 1799, but he was ill at the time and did not stay with the army long.Phipps (2011), v. 5, p. 63 Hardy assumed the rank of general of division on 30 July 1799. He was a friend of Andr√© Mass√©na and knew what was happening at his headquarters even though Hardy was not there. During the summer, the French Directory planned to replace Mass√©na as leader of the Army of the Danube but later decided to confirm him as commander. On 9 September Hardy wrote that Mass√©na was surprised at the decision.Phipps (2011), v. 5, pp. 119‚Äì120. After fighting in the spring and summer of 1800, the French army of Jean Victor Marie Moreau and Austrian army of Paul Kray signed an armistice on 15 July.Arnold (2005), p. 203. On 12 November 1800, the French notified the Austrians that hostilities would start in 15 days. By this time, Moreau's army numbered 107,469 men and was flanked on the left by a 16,260-strong Franco- Dutch army and on the right by 18,602 French soldiers in Switzerland. Most of these troops were veterans led by experienced officers and operating in well- organized and well-equipped formations.Arnold (2005), p. 211. Hardy wrote his wife, \\"The army is superb... this time it is certain that we will not sheath our sword until peace is signed.\\" Unlike the usual French practice of having the soldiers live off the land, each division was trailed by a wagon train with seven days of food.Arnold (2005), p. 212. Grenier's Left Wing consisted of three divisions,Smith (1998), p. 189. the 1st under Claude Juste Alexandre Legrand, the 2nd led by Ney and the 3rd commanded by Hardy. The 6,315-strong 3rd Division was made up of three battalions each of the 53rd and 89th Line Infantry Demi-brigades, three squadrons each of the 13th and 17th Cavalry Regiments and four squadrons each of the 2nd Dragoon and 23rd Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiments. The division's 16 field pieces were manned by the 2nd Company of the 7th Horse Artillery, 4th Company of the 8th Horse Artillery and 15th Company of the 5th Foot Artillery.Arnold (2005), p. 274. Even though outnumbered in the theater, the Austrian army under Archduke John and Franz von Lauer launched an offensive. The Austrian military system soon proved unable to meet expectations, yet the generals managed to bring superior forces to bear.Arnold (2005), p. 214. On the morning of 1 December 1800, the Austrians surprised the divisions of Ney and Hardy in their camps to start the Battle of Ampfing. Despite stubborn fighting, Ney's division was pushed back by the Austrian corps of Louis-Willibrod-Antoine Baillet de Latour.Arnold (2005), pp. 217‚Äì218. Hardy's badly outnumbered division was set upon by Johann Sigismund Riesch's corps. Though some troops from Legrand's division blocked one of Riesch's units, his left flank was slowly forced back. During the fighting, a shellburst killed one of his staff officers and sent a splinter into Hardy's hand. He handed over command of the division to Louis Bastoul. Grenier issued orders to withdraw during which the 2nd Dragoons distinguished themselves. At Ampfing, the French sustained losses of 193 killed, 817 wounded and 697 captured. Hardy wrote his wife that his troops had fought like lions. The archduke and his chief of staff Franz von Weyrother were excited at forcing their opponents to retreat. The Austrian losses of 303 killed, 1,690 wounded and 1,077 prisoners should have sobered them. Instead they became overconfident which led to disaster at the Battle of Hohenlinden two days later.Arnold (2005), pp. 220‚Äì221. Saint-Domingue Expedition Charles Leclerc Toussaint Louverture led a successful slave revolt that established control over Hispaniola with himself as governor general for life. Though Louverture pledged loyalty to France, Napoleon Bonaparte sent Charles Leclerc with 20,000 soldiers to reconquer the island. The expedition sailed from Brest on 14 December 1801 and landed in Haiti in February. Hardy was assigned to the expedition. Before he left France he noted in a letter to his wife that Napoleon persuaded his sister Pauline Bonaparte to accompany her husband Leclerc on the expedition. Hardy did not want Calixte to join him because of the dangers of the ocean passage, the war, the climate and yellow fever.Hardy (1901), p. 261. The naval squadron reached Cap-Fran√ßais (Cap-Ha√Øtien) on 4 February 1802. Leclerc organized his army with Charles Dugua as his chief of staff, Jean-Fran√ßois Joseph Debelle as commander of artillery and engineers, and infantry divisions under Hardy, Jean Boudet, Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Rochambeau and Edme √âtienne Borne Desfourneaux.Hardy (1901), p. 267. HARDY is on Column 6. The divisions of Hardy and Desfourneaux disembarked on the west side of Cap-Fran√ßais on 5 February after Louverture's general Henri Christophe refused to let them land in the port. In this first operation Hardy led the advance guard which drove off several hundred Haitian soldiers and captured six cannons. He arrived at Cap-Fran√ßais to find the town in flames.Hardy (1901), p. 268. The French seized the coastal towns, forcing Louverture to withdraw into the interior. Leclerc planned to have the divisions of Hardy, Desfourneaux and Rochambeau sweep south from Cap-Fran√ßais while Boudet was to move north from Port-au-Prince. Humbert's brigade led by Debelle would move in from a different direction.Hardy (1901), p. 272. On 18 February the French columns advanced, with Desfourneaux on the right, Hardy in the center and Rochambeau on the left. Debelle landed at Port-de-Paix and moved south-east. Leclerc rode with Hardy's column which saw fighting at Marmelade. Hardy took Jean-Baptiste Salme's brigade on an all-night march and stormed Bayonnais at dawn. Meanwhile, Rochambeau's division experienced heavy fighting in the Battle of Ravine-√†-Couleuvres. At one point a large body of Louverture's army was surrounded but it managed to slip away from the French. Hardy returned to Cap-Fran√ßais at the end of the operation.Hardy (1901), pp. 275‚Äì279. On 31 March, Hardy assumed command of his own and Desfourneaux's divisions at Cap- Fran√ßais. Bertrand Clausel took over from Desfourneaux who was ill and Salme succeeded to the command of Hardy's division.Hardy (1901), p. 280. Hardy's chief adversary was Christophe, perhaps the best of Louverture's generals. On 20 April Hardy wrote to Christophe, pointing out that several of Louverture's lieutenants had defected to the French and urging him to do the same.Hardy (1901), pp. 281‚Äì282. Christophe responded politely but he and his troops did not give up.Hardy (1901), p. 284‚Äì285 By May Hardy pacified the northern region and established a civil administration. He wrote affectionately to his wife on 17 May about the recent birth of their third son, saying that he was in good health. On 27 May 1802 he was stricken with yellow fever and died within a few hours. Another source asserted that Hardy died on 29 May. The fever killed most of the French army, including generals Leclerc, Debelle and Dugua. The Haitian armies, apparently on the verge of giving up, continued the war with renewed resolve. On 28 November 1803 Rochambeau surrendered 3,000 disease- ridden French survivors to a British force at Cap-Fran√ßais. The last 1,200 French troops handed over Santo Domingo on 15 July 1809.Hardy (1901), pp. 291‚Äì292.

Early life and education  Although she was born in the United States, Agui√±iga spent her childhood living in Tijuana, Mexico. From ages 4 to 18, she travelled several hours daily across the border to attend school in Los Angeles, an experience that would influence her later life and work. She went on to receive a BA in Applied Design from San Diego State University and an MFA in furniture design from Rhode Island Institute of Design.  Art and design career  Agui√±iga began designing furniture in 1997 while she was still an undergraduate student. Her first design job was working as a designer and fabricator off-camera for the DIY Network show called Freeform Furniture. Throughout her career, Agui√±iga's work has taken many forms but remains generally textile-centric, often combining modern design with elements of traditional craft technique and activism. Using a range of natural materials from beeswax to wool to human hair, Agui√±iga crafts furniture, textiles, wearable pieces, sculptures, and site-specific installations. In addition to designing furniture, jewelry, and other small scale pieces, she has extended her design mediums to fiber and creates weavings with materials such as woven jute, wool, silk, and cotton. She manages a team of nearly all female assistants in the creation of large format wall , woven hangings, by commission. Agui√±iga's work has been featured in the PBS series Craft in America and in a 2011 site-specific exhibition at the Craft and Folk Art Museum, among many other venues. Designer, Ulla Johnson, commissioned a piece by Agui√±iga for her shop in New York. From July 23 through September 17, 2016, Agui√±iga's \\"Teetering of the Marginal\\" accompanied pieces by Lenore Tawney and Loie Hollowell in a gallery exhibit titled 3 Women. The 1977 film 3 Women, written and directed by Robert Altman and starring Shelley Duvall, Sissy Spacek, and Janice Rule, provided inspiration to The Landing to gather the artists for the exhibit. In May through October 2018 Agui√±iga had a solo exhibition of her work at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City titled \\"Tanya Agui√±iga: Craft and Care\\". The show prominently featured her project AMBOS (\\"Art Made Between Opposite Sides\\"), that addresses life on the Mexican-American border. In Spanish \\"ambos\\" means both and according to the project's website the mission of AMBOS is to \\"express and document border emotion through art made on opposite sides by providing a platform to bi-national artists along the border.\\" Her work was also featured in Disrupting Craft: Renwick Invitational 2018 at the Smithsonian American Art Museum's Renwick Gallery.  Activism  Agui√±iga is responsible for multiple \\"performance crafting\\" happenings, including tying herself to the Beverly Hills sign and weaving while wearing traditional Mexican garments. Having grown up on the U.S./Mexico boarder, Agui√±iga uses her life experiences in connection with her craft practice to promote collective creation within communities, spearheading art-based advocacy projects including the Border Art Workshop/Taler de Arte Fronterizo in Maclovio Rojas, Mexico, and AMBOS (Art Made Between Opposite Sides), spanning the US-Mexico border, which seeks to document the emotions of commuters crossing it and gives voice to bi-national artists.

Background Once in the Royal Navy she was part of the 10th Cruiser Squadron. Sinking In the North Channel on her Glasgow to Liverpool route at 05:15 on 11 March 1915, HMS Bayano was attacked by the German submarine SM U-27 about west of Corsewall Lighthouse, Corsewall Point, Galloway, Scotland. The auxiliary cruiser sank in just five minutes and took the commander, Commander H. C. Carr, and 194 other crew members down with it. Most of the crew was asleep and only 26 men survived to be rescued by the British steamer Castlereagh.

The marble altar (1517) is attributed to Lorenzo di Mariano, called il Marrina.

It is not to be confused with parijƒÅt (Sanskrit: ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§ú‡§æ‡§§), whose meaning is \\"descended from\\", \\"begotten by\\" or \\"fully developed\\". In Hindu mythology, the celestial PƒÅrijƒÅt tree is the tree of the universe which is owned by Indrani and planted in svarga located between heaven and earth, which tree, also known as Kalpa-taru, is believed to yield all objects of desire. This tree is identified with the MandƒÅra tree. From the Bhagavata Purana, the Vishnu Purana and the Mahabharata it is learnt that the elaborate process of Samudra manthan of primal waters of the cosmic ocean yielded the PƒÅrijƒÅt tree as one of the three valuables, this tree, said to have blossomed atop Mount Meru in the garden of paradise and identified with the Indian coral tree, was claimed by Indra no sooner it rose to the surface and emitted its fragrance. Krishna is believed to have stolen the PƒÅrijƒÅt flower from Indra‚Äôs paradise to which act pƒÅrijƒÅt-harana (removal of the PƒÅrijƒÅt tree from heaven), which has two forms in the Harivamsa, relates; according to the puranas, at the behest of his wife, Satyabhama, Krishna had uprooted the pƒÅrijƒÅt tree from the Nandana-vana of Indra and brought it to Dwarka. In Hindu astrology, the word, PƒÅrijƒÅt, refers to a RƒÅja yoga based on the Planetary Dispositor Principle. This planetary combination called PƒÅrijƒÅt yoga arises if the lord of the sign occupied by the lord of the Lagna (Ascendant) and the lord of the sign occupied by the dispositor of the lord of the lagna both, or if the lords of the navƒÅmsas occupied by these two lords are situated in a kendra or a trikona from the lagna-kendra in their own or exaltation signs. Parasara states that the person blessed with Parijat yoga will be fond of battles, strong-willed, full of determination, fearless, adept and successful, kind-hearted, forgiving and generous, have faith in Dharma and Karmas, a proud possessor and enjoyer of wealth and comforts and the one who leads a royal life during his or her middle and last part of life. PƒÅrijƒÅta yoga is a combination of the Parvata yoga and the Kahala yoga. Gautama Buddha was blessed with this yoga. References Parijat Tree in Hindi, Parijat Tree History and Parijat Tree Benefits.
