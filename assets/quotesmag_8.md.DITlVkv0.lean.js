It was founded in 2000 under the name ExactTarget. The company filed for an IPO in 2007, but withdrew its filing two years later and raised $145 million in funding. It acquired CoTweet, Pardot, iGoDigital and Keymail Marketing. In 2012, it raised $161.5 million in an initial public offering, before being acquired by Salesforce for $2.5 billion in 2013. ExactTarget was renamed to Salesforce Marketing Cloud in 2014 after the acquisition by Salesforce. Corporate history Salesforce Marketing Cloud was founded under the name ExactTarget in late 2000 by Scott Dorsey, Chris Baggott, and Peter McCormick with $200,000 in financing. Joanna Milliken joined ExactTarget as the first employee in 2001.http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/05/prweb12690686.htm It raised $10.5 million in funding from Insight Venture Partners in 2004. The firm grew from $11.5 million in its second year of operations to $41.1 million in 2006, which was its first profitable year. In December 2007, ExactTarget filed an intent for an initial public offering with the Securities Exchange Commission, but withdrew its filing in May 2009. Instead, it announced that $70 million in venture funding had been raised for international expansion, which was followed by another $75 million round later that year. An office was established in London with the acquisition of a UK-based ExactTarget reseller, Keymail Marketing, in September 2009. The company hired 200 additional employees. In 2010, ExactTarget acquired CoTweet, a company founded in 2008 that develops and markets software for managing multiple Twitter accounts. ExactTarget went public in March 2012 and raised $161.5 million in funding on the New York Stock Exchange. In late 2012, it acquired a marketing automation vendor, Pardot, for $96 million, and the developers of a product recommendation engine, iGoDigital, for $21 million. In 2012, its revenues grew 40 percent over the preceding year. The following June, ExactTarget was acquired by salesforce.com for $2.5 billion. A few months later, salesforce.com said it was laying off 200 staff due to overlaps after the ExactTarget acquisition. That September at the ExactTarget Connections conference, salesforce.com said it was integrating ExactTarget into a new division called Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud. In May 2014, Scott Dorsey stepped down as CEO of ExactTarget and was replaced by Scott McCorkle. The company was renamed in October 2014 to \\"Salesforce Marketing Cloud\\", removing \\"ExactTarget\\" from its name, as part of its integration with Salesforce. Salesforce has plans to move Marketing Cloud to Microsoft Azure. Software and services Salesforce Marketing Cloud develops marketing automation and analytics software for email, mobile, social and online marketing. It also offers consulting and implementation services. The software is sold primarily on a multi-year subscription basis. The price of the subscription is based on what features are enabled, number of users and level of customer service. The software's Interactive Marketing Hub was released in 2010, when the software's user interface was re-done. It serves as the software's primary user interface for managing communications and content through different media. The Salesforce Marketing Cloud software is offered in a hosted, online subscription model. The company owns the CoTweet, Pardot, and iGoDigital tools. Its mobile features, as well as many of its workflow and collaboration tools, were released in July 2013. Salesforce Marketing Cloud was founded as an email marketing vendor. Its email management software maintains mailing lists and schedules and modifies email messages based on what recipients read, click-on or forward. In September 2014 the company introduced the Journey Builder for Apps, which is intended to create customer lifecycle maps of mobile app users. That month, at the September 2014 ExactTarget Connections conference, they announced numerous updates to their software. This included integration with software products owned by Salesforce.com, such as Buddy Media and Social Studio, as well as improvements to workflow and content management tools. In November 2014 the company released a new version of Social Studio. This release expanded Social Studio beyond Salesforce's Marketing Cloud, where it started, integrating it with the Service Cloud and the Sales Cloud. This enabled sending leads over to the Sales Cloud ‚Äî the salesperson can see the full context of the company's social media interactions with the lead.https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/19/salesforce- social-studio-revamp/ Operations As of December 2012, about two thirds of ExactTarget's 1,500 employees were located in Indianapolis. The company hosts an annual user conference called Salesforce Connections, previously the ExactTarget Connections Event. The first Connections event in 2007 attracted 500 attendees, and it has since grown into one of the largest conferences on digital marketing. The event was located in Indianapolis from 2007 until 2014, New York City in 2015, and Atlanta in 2016. It did not occur in 2017 as it was merged with world tours, and was brought back in Chicago in 2018. As of April 28, 2016 the conference was renamed Salesforce Connections. It merged with Salesforce World Tour in 2017.

Most are found in the Indo-Pacific, but three species, S. berryi, S. mona, and S. octoactinus, are found in the Western Atlantic. They are found on rocky reefs at depths of . Traditionally, this genus is the only member of the family Symphysanodontidae, but in 2017 a new species, C. aureolateralis, was placed in its own genus Cymatognathus. Description The largest species of Symphysanodon can reach in length. Their bodies are slender and compressed, with blunt snouts. They are red, pink, oranges or yellow in colour. The caudal fin is usually distinctively forked. The dorsal fins have 9 dorsal spines and 10 soft rays, whereas the anal fin has three anal spines and seven or eight soft rays.

It is a member of the Synanceiidae (devilfishes, goblinfishes, and stonefishes) family of the Scorpaeniformes order of ray- finned fishes. These benthic fishes are found on sandy or silty substrates of lagoon and seaward reefs, in coastal regions of tropical oceans.Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2010.FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. Fish Identification at FishBase, version (01/2010).Inimicus sinensis. Accessed 23 March 2010. Like all the other known species of Inimicus, I. sinensis is a demersal ambush predator. They are nocturnal, and often dig themselves partially into the sandy seabed during the day. Geographic distribution Indo-Pacific: Indian Ocean to Taiwan, Philippines, Indonesia, the Arafura Sea and Western Australia. Physical description I. sinensis adults can attain a body length of up to 26 centimeters in length. The body color is red or sandy yellow with light blotches, and very similar to that of the surrounding sandy or coral seabed in which they are found. This coloration acts as a camouflage which renders them extremely difficult to detect in their natural habitat. The skin is without scales except along the lateral line, and is covered with venomous spines and wartlike glands which give it a knobby appearance. The head is flattened, depressed and concave. The eyes, mouth and nostrils project upwards and outwards from the dorsal aspect of the head. Sexual dimorphism is not believed to occur in this species. Fin morphology: * dorsal fin: composed of 15 to 17 spines and 7 to 9 soft rays. * caudal fin: composed of 2-4 spines and 4-14 soft rays, with dark bands at basal and subterminal positions. * pelvic fin: composed of one spine and 3-5 soft rays. * pectoral fin: composed of 10-12 rays. The two most caudal rays of each pectoral fin are detached from the rest of the fin, and angled in a ventral direction. The fish employ these two rays to prop up the forward part of their body, as well as to \\"walk\\" along the bottom of the substrate.World Database of Marine Species: Spiny devil fish . Accessed 03-22-2010.WetWebMedia.com: The Ghoulfish/Scorpion/Stonefishes of the Subfamily Choridactylinae (Inimicinae), by Bob Fenner. Accessed 03-27-2010. The ventral surface of the pectoral fins bears broad black bands containing smaller, lighter spots at the basal and distal ends. In I. filamentosus, these bands are attenuated, while the bands of I. sinensis have yellow spots on them. This is a key feature for distinguishing the two species, which are otherwise nearly identical. Behavior I. sinensis is a piscivorous ambush predator. It is nocturnal and typically lies partially buried on the sea floor or on a coral head during the day, covering itself with sand and other debris to further camouflage itself. It has no known natural predators. When disturbed by a scuba diver or a potential predator, it fans out its brilliantly colored pectoral and caudal fins as a warning. Once dug in, it is very reluctant to leave its hiding place. When it does move, it displays an unusual mechanism of subcarangiform locomotion---it crawls slowly along the seabed, employing the four lower rays (two on each side) of its pectoral fins as legs.

Borovni≈°ƒçica Creek has created many erosion features such as pools, rapids, and waterfalls, of which five are extremely beautiful and well known because they plunge from . It has been proclaimed a natural value of national significance. History The word pekel 'hell' has been generalized in Slovene to refer to secretive, frightening, isolated, hard-to-reach places, such as gorges and caves, where the Devil and other imaginary creatures are believed to live;Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 303. compare also Hell Cave. The first footpaths through Hell Gorge were made over one hundred years ago by charcoal burners collecting wood for charcoal. There were several mills and sawmills above and below the inaccessible gorge; some remains of these can still be seen today. The first records about Hell Gorge as a tourist attraction were published in 1897 by Josip Ciril Oblak, who named it \\"a tourist heaven.\\" At that time organized groups of hikers also started coming to Hell Gorge. It was officially opened to the public on June 29, 1904, after the original footpath that leads to the second waterfall and a wooden ladder to the third one were created. The complete footpath, including bridges and ladders, leading through the gorge was finished in 1925 and later renovated on a regular basis. Geology The deeply cut bed of Otav≈°ƒçica Creek flows down into the Ljubljana Marshes (335 m) from the Bloke‚ÄìRakitna Plateau (650 m) and changes its name to the Borovni≈°ƒçica. The gorge is carved into layers of dolomite. The steeply cascading tectonic fault in this area indicated the way for the water to flow. Intensive tectonics caused the formation of several geomorphological curiosities: a solitary mountain named the Devil's Tooth (), a natural window (the jag in the Devil's Tooth), and precipitous rock walls. Fossils of some seashells and snails can be found in the gorge. Biology Both Alpine and Dinaric vegetation can be seen in Hell Gorge, including the endemic Carniolan primrose (Primula carniolica). There is also a large variety of tree species. One can encounter chamois and the water ouzel, which also nests in the gorge.

He belonged to the Phagmodrupa Dynasty which was the leading regime in Tibet from 1354 to 1435, and exerted some influence until the early 17th century. His reign saw the collapse of the political power of the dynasty, and the beginning of two centuries of internal strife. Succession Drakpa Jungne was a son of Sangye Gyaltsen, a brother of the former king Drakpa Gyaltsen, who had enjoyed a long and prosperous reign over the central parts of Tibet. Sangye Gyaltsen married two ladies who belonged to the regional vassal family Rinpungpa. By each wife he begot a son, of whom Drakpa Jungne was the eldest, born to lady Kunga Pal Dzomma. After the death of Drakpa Gyaltsen, the ministers could not reach an agreement about the succession. The Rinpungpa lord, Norzang, suggested that the abbot of the Thel monastery should decide, and he pointed out the 18-year-old Drakpa Jungne, who had formerly been a lama of the Tsethang monastery. Although Sangye Gyaltsen had his own designs on the throne, he accepted the advice of the abbot, and his son was enthroned.Ariane Macdonald, 'Pr√©ambule √† la lecture d'un Rgya-Bod yig-chan'. Journal asiatique 1963, pp. 104‚Äì5. Internal war and dynastic collapse After two years, in 1434, the abbot of Thel died, and his moral influence vanished. The father of the young ruler, Sangye Gyaltsen, now claimed the throne. The result was a civil war lasting about one year. 1434 became known as \\"the year of internal collapse of the Phagmodrupa\\". Sangye Gyaltsen was pushed back and had to flee to Yargyab. The Rinpungpa lord Norzang came out as the winner in the affair.Ariane Macdonald, 1963, p. 105. According to later historiography Norzang's son Dondup Dorje took hold of the important stronghold Samdrubtse (present Shigatse) in 1435. More recent research indicates that Samdrubtse was captured in 1446, at a time when there was a Phagmodrupa interregnum.Olaf Czaja, Medieval rule in Tibet, Vol. I-II. Wien 2013, p. 223. At any rate the Rinpungpa family came to increasingly dominate the Tsang region, which they would hold until 1565.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa, Tibet. A Political History. Yale 1967, pp. 86-7. Later reign Nevertheless, the Rinpungpa let their young kinsman remain on the throne, though his immediate influence was now restricted to √ú (East Central Tibet). Due to the hard times, Drakpa Jungne was unable to tour the fiefs in Tsang. The king took some interest in the moral discipline of his people, and promulgated restrictions about prostitution and the drinking of chhaang.Giuseppe Tucci, Tibetan Painted Sctrolls. Rome 1949, Vol. I, pp. 28-9: Giuseppe Tucci, Deb T'er Dmar Po Gsar Ma. Rome 1971, p. 220. He was \\"a man of deep spirituality and well-versed in mantrayana but with a parochial outlook and not cut out for worldly affairs\\".Per K. S√∏rensen & Guntram Hazod, Rulers of the Celestial Plain. Wien 2007, p. 355. A tapestry tangka made in the name of Drakpa Jungne has been preserved, and might have been used at his formal enthronement.Per K. Sorensen & Guntram Hazod, 2007, p. 358. Unlike the previous practice which prescribed celibacy for the Phagmodru leaders, Drakpa Jungne married with Zomdrak Wangjam of the Kharpa family and sired a son, Ngagi Wangpo who would become ruler much later. At his death in 1445, Drakpa Jungne was succeeded by his half-brother Kunga Lekpa.

The name has been adopted by a primary school - Belmont Castle Academy. History Belmont Castle was built c. 1795 for Zachariah Button, a wealthy local landowner, who also owned a neighbouring chalk quarry.Powell (1983) pp. 35-56 During the 1840s, when the property was occupied by the Webb family, it was the seat of local cricket matches as well as a circle of music lovers mentioned by the pianist and writer Alice Diehl in her memoirs.Diehl (1908) pp. 9-15 One of its later owners, Edward R. Parker, who lived at Belmont Castle from 1880 until 1900, was chairman of the local county board. During his time there, Belmont's park was often used for local events, including a political rally in support of the Franchise Bill attended by 2000-3000 people. In the 20th century, the house was only sporadically occupied and chalk quarries increasingly encroached upon the pleasure grounds, although they were still used for charity fetes into the 1930s. When the Dobree family, the last tenants of the entire house, departed in 1930, the mansion was divided into individual rented flats and meeting rooms. The remaining land was let out to local farmers for grazing cattle and to the Tilbury Gas Company who used the North Lawn as a sports field and rented part of the mansion to use for changing rooms. The last owner of the property was the Associated Portland Cement Company, who had the mansion demolished in 1943 to make way for yet another chalk quarry.The later history of the estate is based on Carney (1986). Architecture Belmont Castle seen from the River Thames c. 1830 The house was designed as an imitation of a medieval baronial castle with battlements and a four-story tower overlooking the River Thames. Early visitors commented on the luxuriousness and elegance of its interior fittings which matched the neo-Gothic style of its exterior. The library was oval shaped with fitted book cases and mouldings and opened out to a double flight of stone steps descending to a terrace. Its grounds contained a large walled kitchen garden which included fruit trees and a hothouse. Surrounding the house were extensive pleasure grounds, landscaped with forest trees, shrubs, and plants. These terminated on the west side at a Gothic temple and on the east with an orchard and paddock. The house had two approaches: the first from a lodge (also built in the Gothic style) on the south lawn near the road between West Thurrock and Grays, and the second from the north lawn via the road from Stifford village.The descriptions of Belmont Castle in its heyday are based on Hughson (1809) p. 210 and Coller (1861) p. 358 The estate was situated over a medieval rural settlement and had several dene holes which were covered over during the landscaping of the pleasure grounds.Essex County Council (2007) pp. 73-74 Notes Sources *Carney, T.

He served in the government of Congo-Brazzaville as Minister of Trade from 1991 to 1992 and as Minister of Industrial Development from 1992 to 1993. Mi√©rassa was also a minor candidate in the 1992 presidential election as well as the 2009 presidential election. Political career during the 1980s and 1990s Mi√©rassa, an economist and statistician by profession, is an ethnic T√©k√©.John F. Clark, The Failure of Democracy in the Republic of Congo (2008), Lynne Rienner Publishers, page 134. During the single-party rule of the Congolese Labour Party (PCT), Mi√©rassa was Director of the National Management Center (Centre national de gestion, Cenages).\\"Cl√©ment Mierassa\\", La Lettre du Continent N¬∞568, Africa Intelligence, 9 July 2009 . At the PCT congress held on 27-31 July 1984, he was included on the Secretariat of the PCT Central Committee as Secretary for Management and Economic Activities.R√©my Bazenguissa-Ganga, Les voies du politique au Congo: essai de sociologie historique (1997), Karthala Editions, page 278 . He was the only T√©k√© on the PCT Secretariat at the time, but he was removed from the body at a plenary session of the Central Committee on 24-30 November 1986, when it was decided to reduce the Secretariat from 11 to eight members.Bazenguissa-Ganga, Les voies du politique au Congo, page 287 . Along with 300 others, Mi√©rassa signed the petition of 7 July 1990, calling on President Denis Sassou Nguesso to convene a national conference for political reform. During the week that followed, the government announced that it had discovered a plot to oust Sassou Nguesso, and Mi√©rassa was arrested, along with Auguste-C√©lestin Gongarad Nkoua, who had also signed the petition. The alleged coup plot was dubbed the \\"T√©k√© plot\\" due to the ethnicity of the alleged conspirators. The government insisted that the arrests were based on involvement in a coup plot and were unrelated to the petition.Sophia Mappa, D√©velopper par la d√©mocratie?: injonctions occidentales et exigences plan√©taires (1995), pages 329-330, note 5 .Patrice Yengo, La guerre civile du Congo-Brazzaville, 1993-2002: \\"chacun aura sa part\\" (2006), pages 55-56 . Mi√©rassa spent only a few weeks in jail; on 14 August 1990, President Sassou Nguesso granted him an amnesty, along with other political prisoners, to mark the 27th anniversary of the 1963 revolution.Bazenguissa-Ganga, Les voies du politique au Congo: essai de sociologie historique, page 396 . He then openly opposed the PCT regime,Bazenguissa-Ganga, Les voies du politique au Congo, page 438 . founding a new political party, the PSDC. He applied to the Ministry of Territorial Administration for legal recognition of the PSDC on 30 September 1990.Gaston- Jonas Kouvibidila, Histoire du multipartisme au Congo-Brazzaville: La marche √† rebours, 1940-1991 (2000), page 215 . According to Mi√©rassa, the PSDC was the fourth party (excluding the PCT) to register with the government.Africa Research Bulletin, volumes 26-27 (1990), page 9,866. At the conclusion of the February-June 1991 National Conference, Mi√©rassa was appointed as Minister of Trade and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the transitional government of Prime Minister Andr√© Milongo;Bazenguissa-Ganga, Les voies du politique au Congo, page 399 . he remained in that post until 1992. Mi√©rassa announced on 11 May 1992 that he would stand as the PSDC candidate in the August 1992 presidential election.Gaston-Jonas Kouvibidila, Histoire du multipartisme au Congo-Brazzaville: Les d√©buts d'une crise attendue, 1992-1993 (2000), page 144 . He attracted little support in the election, placing tenth with 0.67% of the vote.Fabrice Weissman, √âlection pr√©sidentielle de 1992 au Congo: Entreprise politique et mobilisation √©lectorale (1993), page 72 .Mubuma Guma-Kanh'a Sheri, Partis et familles de partis au Congo-Brazzaville (2006), page 265 .Kouvibidila, Les d√©buts d'une crise attendue, page 153 . He received 4.8% of the vote in Plateaux Department, but in every other part of the country his score was negligible.Dieter Nohlen, Michael Krennerich, and Bernhard Thibaut, Elections in Africa: A Data Handbook (1999), page 274. Subsequently, he and the PSDC supported Bernard Kol√©las, the candidate of the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development (MCDDI), in the second round of the election, but Kol√©las was defeated by Pascal Lissouba, the candidate of the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy (UPADS). The MCDDI, the PSDC, and five other parties then formed the Union for Democratic Renewal (URD) opposition coalition on 27 August 1992.Joachim Emmanuel Goma-Thethet, \\"Alliances in the political and electoral process in the Republic of Congo 1991-97\\", in Liberal Democracy and Its Critics in Africa: Political Dysfunction and the Struggle for Social Progress (2005), ed. Tukumbi Lumumba-Kasongo, Zed Books, page 111. After Lissouba took office as President, the Congolese Labour Party (PCT), which had briefly supported him, defected to the opposition.John F. Clark, \\"Congo: Transition and the Struggle to Consolidate\\", in Political Reform in Francophone Africa (1997), ed. John F. Clark and David E. Gardinier, pages 72-75 and note 45. Together, the URD and PCT controlled a majority of seats in the National Assembly, and they sought the appointment of Kol√©las, the main opposition leader, as Prime Minister. Mi√©rassa met with Lissouba on 9 November 1992 to request that he appoint Kol√©las. However, Lissouba was unwilling to do so, preferring to instead dissolve the National Assembly later in November.Patrick Quantin, \\"Congo: Transition d√©mocratique et conjoncture critique\\", in Transitions d√©mocratiques africaines: dynamiques et contraintes (1990-1994) (1997), eds. Jean-Pascal Daloz and Patrick Quantin, Karthala Editions, page 169 . His decision provoked a political crisis that was resolved through the formation of an opposition-dominated power-sharing government, led by Prime Minister Claude Antoine Dacosta. In Dacosta's government, which was appointed on 25 December 1992, Mi√©rassa was included as Minister of Industrial Development, Fishing, and Crafts.Africa Research Bulletin: Political, Social, and Cultural Series, volume 30 (1993), page 10,847.Kouvibidila, Les d√©buts d'une crise attendue, page 249 . By assuaging the URD-PCT coalition, the Dacosta government was intended to stabilize the political situation and produce the appropriate conditions for the organization of an early parliamentary election, which was held in May 1993. Nevertheless, the election proved to be extremely controversial; the pro- Lissouba coalition officially prevailed in the first round of the election, leading the URD-PCT coalition to denounce the results as fraudulent and boycott the second round. On 10 June 1993, four days after the second round was held, Mi√©rassa asked the Supreme Court to clarify legal issues surrounding the election. His query produced a favorable ruling from the Supreme Court, which judged that the release of the first round results and the organization of the second round were both illegal. Lissouba nevertheless appointed a new government based on his parliamentary majority, but the URD-PCT coalition refused to accept it. The controversy produced an extended period of political violence; although the second round was held over again on 3 October 1993, the violence continued well into 1994, and about 2,000 people were killed. On 10 June 1997, a few days after the outbreak of the 1997 civil war, Mi√©rassa was arrested by forces loyal to President Lissouba. He was reportedly tortured in the Diata section of Brazzaville and nearly executed before an order to the contrary arrived from higher command.\\"Entre arbitraire et impunit√© : les droits de l'homme au Congo-Brazzaville\\" , Congolese Human Rights Observatory, April 1998 . Political career, 2000-2008 Forces loyal to Sassou Nguesso prevailed in the civil war, ousting Lissouba in October 1997. Mi√©rassa continued to lead his political party, the PSDC, in the years that followed. On 24 February 2007, the PSDC called for the establishment of an independent national electoral commission that would be fully empowered to oversee the June 2007 parliamentary election. It also called for electoral preparations to be conducted on a consensual basis, with the input of all parties, and it called for politicians to \\"reject the logic of war\\".\\"L√©gislatives 2007. Le Parti social d√©mocrate congolais recommande la mise en place d'une commission nationale √©lectorale ind√©pendante\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 28 February 2007 . Mi√©rassa participated in a meeting of opposition parties on 23 March 2007; at the meeting, the parties issued a statement in favor of the establishment of an independent and fully empowered electoral commission. Mi√©rassa was designated to head a technical committee that was charged with collecting opinions on the idea from parties in the opposition as well as parties supporting Sassou Nguesso; those opinions were to be presented to the government for its consideration.\\"L'opposition r√©clame une commission ind√©pendante\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 27 March 2007 . Alongside other opposition leaders, Mi√©rassa participated in a May 2007 opposition rally in Brazzaville demanding the creation of an independent electoral commission prior to the election and threatening to boycott the vote otherwise.Guillaume Ondz√©, \\"Le collectif des partis de l'opposition menace de boycotter les l√©gislatives\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 13 May 2007 . Continuing to press their demand for a new electoral commission, Mi√©rassa and various other opposition leaders met on 25 May 2007 and called for the people to boycott the election if their demand was not met. They emphasized that a law updating the electoral code had already been passed by Parliament, but had not yet been promulgated by President Sassou Nguesso, and they criticized Sassou Nguesso for calling an election that would be held under the terms of an outdated law.Roger Ngomb√©, \\"Les partis de l'opposition optent pour le boycott pacifique des scrutins l√©gislatifs des 24 juin et 22 juillet prochains\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 28 May 2007 . At the time of the June 2007 parliamentary election, Mi√©rassa was President of the Collective of Parties and Political Associations of the Opposition and Center. Acting on his behalf, Ambroise Herv√© Malonga brought a case before the Constitutional Court requesting that the Court annul Sassou Nguesso's decree calling the election on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. On 22 June 2007, two days prior to the election, the Court rejected the case.Roger Ngomb√©, \\"La Cour constitutionnelle rejette cinq recours sur les √©lections l√©gislatives\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 23 June 2007 . Following the 2007 parliamentary election, the PSDC participated in the creation of an opposition coalition, the Alliance for Democracy and the Republic (ARD). Mi√©rassa played a leading role in the ARD's creation; he chaired the opening session of the ARD National Coordination on 13 October 2007, and he was elected as President of the ARD.\\"Crise √† l'ARD : le bureau ex√©cutif du PSDC r√©agit aux propos d'Ambroise Herv√© Malonga\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 17 September 2008 . In the latter capacity, he held a press conference in mid-May 2008 together with the leader of another opposition coalition--Pascal Tsaty Mabiala of the Alliance for the New Republic (ARN)--to demand that the government withdraw a decree setting a date for the closure of nominations for the 2008 local elections. Mi√©rassa and Tsaty Mabiala objected to the decree on the grounds that no date for the election had been set and political parties had not been consulted regarding the timetable. Mi√©rassa, who accused the government of employing intimidation tactics, was careful to stress that they were not threatening violence and would only pursue \\"the legal means of protest\\" if their demand was ignored.Roger Ngomb√©, \\"Elections locales : l'opposition demande le retrait de l'arr√™t√© fixant la date de cl√¥ture des candidatures\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 14 May 2008 . At a press conference in Brazzaville on 6 September 2008, Mi√©rassa discussed a variety of topics; most importantly, he announced that he had resigned as President of the ARD. Reacting to critics who accused him of corruption, he said that he planned to take legal action against them. Mi√©rassa also critically assessed Sassou Nguesso's state of the nation speech of 13 August. He again argued that Sassou Nguesso and his government were unwilling to engage in dialogue with the opposition and set up a truly independent electoral commission, and he argued that Sassou Nguesso's emphasis on \\"a grandiose list of so-called accomplishments\\" was deceptive: \\"It hides a reality, that of an extremely rich country whose citizens paradoxically sink in misery.\\"\\"Pr√©sidentielle 2009 : Cl√©ment Mi√©rassa se r√©jouit √† l'annonce de l'arriv√©e probable d'observateurs europ√©ens\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 6 September 2008 . Later in September, Malonga dismissed Mi√©rassa's resignation from ARD as unimportant, arguing that Mi√©rassa was not present for the ARD's creation. The PSDC retorted that Mi√©rassa had been actively involved with the ARD from the beginning, chairing meetings of the leadership, and it claimed that it was in fact Malonga who had been absent. Political activity since 2009 In February 2009, together with 17 other opposition leaders, Mi√©rassa signed an agreement on the creation of a front intended to defeat Sassou Nguesso and win the July 2009 presidential election.\\"Dix-huit partis de l'opposition congolaise cr√©ent un front pour conqu√©rir le pouvoir\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 23 February 2009 . Mi√©rassa was designated as the PSDC's candidate for the election.Muriel Devey, \\"Pr√©sidentielles: Contre Sassou, qui ?\\", Jeune Afrique, 6 July 2009 . On 18 June 2009, the Constitutional Court validated his candidacy, along with the candidacies of 13 others.\\"D√©cision de la cour constitutionnelle du 18 Juin 2009\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 22 June 2009 . However, four candidates were rejected; among them was Ange-Edouard Poungui, the candidate of the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy (UPADS), Congo-Brazzaville's main opposition party.\\"Congo bans 4 opposition candidates from vote\\", AFP, 19 June 2009. Poungui's candidacy was excluded on the grounds that he did not meet the constitutional requirement of two years' continuous residency in Congo-Brazzaville.Roger Ngomb√©, \\"Le Front des partis de l'opposition congolaise conteste l'invalidation de la candidature d'Ange Edouard Poungui\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 19 June 2009 . Along with other leaders of the Front of Congolese Opposition Parties (FPOC), Mi√©rassa denounced the Constitutional Court's decision to reject Poungui's candidacy. On 10 July 2009, two days prior to the presidential election, Mi√©rassa and five other candidates--Mathias Dzon, Guy Romain Kinfoussia, Bonaventure Mizidy Bavoueza, Jean-Francois Tchibinda Kouangou, and Marion Matzimba Ehouango--called for the election to be delayed, claiming that the electoral lists were deeply flawed and included people who were not eligible to vote, as well as people who did not exist at all. At an opposition rally later on the same day, Mi√©rassa and the others called for the people to boycott the election. Dzon declared that \\"for us, the election is not taking place on 12 July ... It will take place on the day the Congolese people are given a real choice.\\"\\"Opposition candidates urge poll boycott in Congo\\", AFP, 10 July 2009. Provisional election results were announced on 15 July 2009, showing that Sassou Nguesso won the election with 78.61% of the vote, while voter turnout was placed at 66.42%;Laudes Martial Mbon, \\"Sassou Nguesso sweeps back to power in Congo\\", AFP, 15 July 2009. although Mi√©rassa had called for a boycott, his name remained on the ballot and he placed tenth, receiving 0.25% of the vote.\\"Rapport final de la Mission d'observation √©lectorale de la soci√©t√© civile africaine du scrutin pr√©sidentiel du 12 juillet 2009 en R√©publique du Congo\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 16 August 2009 . Mi√©rassa and the other five boycotting candidates held a press conference on 17 July, at which they denounced the official turnout rate as absurd; they argued that the turnout was actually less than 10%, that the results had no credibility, and that Sassou Nguesso had no popular legitimacy.Willy Mbossa, \\"Le scrutin du 12 juillet dernier n'a √©t√© qu'une mascarade, selon les six candidats ayant pr√¥n√© le boycott de l'√©lection pr√©sidentielle\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 18 July 2009 . Mi√©rassa, like four of the other boycotting candidates, appealed to the Constitutional Court, but it rejected his appeal, along with the others, on 25 July 2009.Thierry Noungou, \\"√âlection pr√©sidentielle : la Cour constitutionnelle confirme la victoire de Denis Sassou N'Guesso\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 25 July 2009 . Mi√©rassa was elected to succeed Mathias Dzon as President of FPOC on 6 March 2010, in accordance with the coalition's internal regulations requiring the presidency to rotate every six months.Willy Mbossa, \\"Pr√©sidence de l'opposition : Cl√©ment Mierassa succ√®de √† Mathias Dzon\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 8 March 2010 . Reacting to a call for greater participation by women in politics, Mi√©rassa said on 27 March 2010 that women in the various parties should initiate discussions on the question of female participation. On the same occasion, he said that FPOC would participate in the 2012 parliamentary election, but only if it was preceded by an inclusive political dialogue establishing the proper conditions for the election.Roger Ngomb√©, \\"Les femmes de l'opposition d√©termin√©es √† √™tre pr√©sentes dans les sph√®res de prise de d√©cisions\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 29 March 2010 . On 20 April 2010, Mi√©rassa and Pascal Tsaty Mabiala met with Jacques Banangandzala, the President of the Higher Council for the Freedom of Communication (CSLC), to express opposition complaints regarding the state media. Mi√©rassa said that the state media did not give adequate coverage to opposition activities and stressed the need for the opposition's viewpoints to be represented in the state media if the country was to have \\"genuine democracy\\". Banangandzala replied to the concerns by saying that the law was fair, providing for the representation of political pluralism in the state media, and that it should be \\"applied rigorously\\".Rock Gassakys, \\"Les partis de l'opposition r√©clament un acc√®s de toutes les formations politiques aux m√©dias d'Etat\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 20 April 2010 . Mi√©rassa, along with Malonga, then met with Bienvenu Okiemy, the Minister of Communication, on 22 April 2010. They told Okiemy that the state media did not give adequate coverage to the opposition and that the opposition's views were not correctly represented when it did receive coverage. Okiemy promised that the situation would be remedied.Lydie Gis√®le Oko, \\"Cl√©ment Mierassa satisfait de sa rencontre avec le ministre de la Communication\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 22 April 2010 . After more than a year as President of FPOC, Mi√©rassa was succeeded by Rigobert Ngouolali at the coalition's third national convention, which was held in Brazzaville on 9-10 April 2011. Mi√©rassa was instead designated as Vice-President for Economic and Financial Issues.Parfait Wilfried Douniama, \\"Vie des partis : Rigobert Ngouolali prend les r√™nes du FPOC\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 11 April 2011 . Amidst discussion about the possibility of changing the constitution to enable Sassou Nguesso to run for another term, Mi√©rassa said at a press conference on 18 February 2014 that the PSDC would argue against any change to the two-term limit. He also said that freedom of the press was not being fully respected, and he argued that the government was wasting money and not investing it properly, leaving the country poorer than it should be.Jean Jacques Koubemba, \\"Vie des partis : le PSDC entend d√©fendre le principe de la constitution\\" , ADIAC, 18 February 2014 .Cyr A.

On 3 August 2014, in the context of the ongoing constitutional debate, he alleged that Sassou Nguesso was violating his oath to uphold the existing constitution, which he said was \\"high treason\\".\\"D√©bat sur la Constitution : l'opposition crie √† la \\"haute trahison\\"\\", ADIAC, 4 August 2014 .

Biography None of his publishers is known to have ever supplied a biography, but Russell Trainer's family states that he was born in Detroit, Michigan and enrolled in law school at the University of Detroit. He served in the Philippines in the infantry during World War II and was awarded a Bronze Star. In 1946, he was the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the first district seat in the Michigan State Senate. He was skilled at gaining people's confidence, and his career consisted of a variety of opportunistic enterprises, living mostly on ill-gotten gains, culminating with his arrest in Coldwater, Michigan, in 1959, where he attempted to cash a bad check. There were warrants for his arrest in several states. Trainer served 18 months in the Jackson State Penitentiary in Jackson, Michigan where he wrote his first novel, The Warden's Wife, which was published for the adult paperback market shortly after his release. He remained in Detroit, and wrote The Lolita Complex, and a number of novels, most of them published by Midwood, as a part of a series of softcore paperbacks for the adult market. He also sold a number of children's stories and articles, under various pseudonyms. Trainer was married twice, and the father of six children. He settled in California in 1966, and established his own publishing house, marketing books following his own writing genre, and died in Stockton, California, in 1992. Literary importance Trainer's importance stems from his publication in 1965, of his most famous work, The Lolita Complex, which had the appearance of a serious psychological work, with an extensive bibliography of legitimate authorities, who were liberally quoted and referenced from their work. Trainer, however, had no credentials at all as a psychologist, and many authorities saw the work as a sham and the author as a charlatan. The title is a reference to Vladimir Nabokov's book, Lolita, in which a middle-aged man becomes sexually obsessed with a 12-year-old girl. When Trainer's book was translated into Japanese, it triggered a movement known as lolicon, the Japanese form of the title of the translated book. Influence Lolicon is a Japanese portmanteau of the phrase \\"Lolita complex\\". In Japan, the term describes an attraction to young girls, or an individual with such an attraction. Outside Japan, the term is less common and most often refers to a genre of manga and anime wherein childlike female characters are depicted in an erotic manner. Since 2007, there has been increasing concern in Japan with the \\"Lolita Complex Boom\\", with young girls being uses as sex icons. The term \\"Lolita Complex\\" has been adopted by a Japanese electronica musical group.

Fossils of weigeltisaurids have been found in Madagascar, Germany, Great Britain, and Russia. Possible weigeltisaurid fossils have been found in Triassic strata in North America. They are characterized by long rod- shaped bones extending from the torso that most likely supported wing-like membranes. Similar membranes are also found in several other extinct reptiles such as kuehneosaurids and Mecistotrachelos, as well as living gliding lizards, although each group evolved these structures independently. The gliding membranes in these other groups differ from those of weigeltisaurids in that they are formed by elongated ribs rather than distinct rod-like bones. Weigeltisaurids are also characterized by the large crest-like structures at the back of their skulls, which are lined with spikes formed from bony osteoderms. In addition to gliding membranes, weigeltisaurids have several other adaptations to an arboreal or tree-living lifestyle. Their skeletons are lightened by large air spaces within the bones. The region of the spinal column that connect to the hip, called the sacrum, is formed by three vertebrae rather than two as in most early reptiles, which would have stabilized the skeleton from stresses experienced while climbing. The limb bones of weigeltisaurids have well-developed joint surfaces and prominent ridges for the attachment of muscles, an indication that their limbs were strong enough to support vertical climbing up tree trunks. The shaft of the femur or thigh bone is twisted, allowing for greater flexibility of the hind limbs. The long finger and strongly recurved claw bones with large attachment points for flexor muscles may be adaptations for clinging to tree bark. The wide distribution of weigeltisaurid fossils suggests that the group underwent a global dispersal in a relatively short amount of geologic time. The widespread dispersal of weigeltisaurids may be attributed to their radiation into an arboreal, insectivorous ecological niche previously unoccupied by land vertebrates.

It is a member of the larger family of PDE inhibitors. The PDE4 family of enzymes are the most prevalent PDE in immune cells. They are predominantly responsible for hydrolyzing cAMP within both immune cells and cells in the central nervous system. Therapeutic utility The prototypical PDE4 inhibitor is rolipram. PDE4 inhibitors are known to possess procognitive (including long term memory-improving), wakefulness-promoting, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory effects. Consequently, PDE4 inhibitors have been investigated as treatments for a diverse group of different diseases, including central nervous system disorders such as major depressive disorder (clinical depression), anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, attention deficit- hyperactivity disorder, Huntington's disease, stroke, autism and inflammatory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. PDE4D inhibition, along with PDE4A inhibition also appears to be responsible for the antidepressant effects of PDE4 inhibitors. Similarly PDE4B inhibition appears to be required for the antipsychotic effects of PDE4 inhibitors, in line with this view PDE4B polymorphisms and altered gene expression in the central nervous system have been associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in a postmortem study. PDE4 also regulates the D1/PKA/DARPP-32 signalling cascade in the frontal cortex, which may contribute to the antipsychotic and procognitive effects of PDE4 inhibitors. Whereas PDE4C is expressed primarily in the periphery and hence may be partly responsible for the peripheral effects of PDE4 inhibitors (e.g. their anti-inflammatory effects). PDE4 inhibition is also known to attenuate ethanol seeking and consumption in rats, hence suggesting its possible utility in the treatment of alcohol dependence. A few different lines of evidence suggests the therapeutic utility in the treatment of brain tumours. The clinical development of PDE4 inhibitors has been hampered by their potent emetic effects, which appear to be related to their inhibition of PDE4D which is expressed in the area postrema. Adverse reactions Nausea, vomiting, and related general gastrointestinal side effects are the most commonly implicated side effects of PDE4 inhibitors. Other possible side effects include respiratory and urinary tract infections, which have been discovered from the clinical use of roflumilast. Examples  * Apremilast, a phthalimide derivative that was approved by the U.S. FDA in March 2014 for use as a treatment for psoriatic arthritis, and in September 2014 for the treatment of plaque psoriasis under the brand name Otezla. * Cilomilast, in clinical development by GlaxoSmithKline for treatment of COPD. * Crisaborole (AN2728), a boron-containing drug for the topical treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.Anacor AN2728 at Anacor website Page accessed May 15, 2015 It was approved by the FDA on December 14, 2016 under the brand name Eucrisa for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (eczema) in patients 2 years of age and older. * Diazepam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic, amnesic, hypnotic, sedative and muscle relaxant. * Ibudilast, a neuroprotective and bronchodilator drug used mainly in the treatment of asthma and stroke. It inhibits PDE4 to the greatest extent, but also shows significant inhibition of other PDE subtypes, and so acts as a selective PDE4 inhibitor or a non- selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, depending on the dose. * Luteolin, supplement extracted from peanuts that also possesses IGF-1 properties. * Mesembrenone, an alkaloid from the herb Sceletium tortuosum (Kanna). * Piclamilast, a more potent inhibitor than rolipram. * Roflumilast, licensed for the treatment of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the EU, Russia and U.S. by Merck & Co. under the trade names Daxas and Daliresp. * Rolipram, used as investigative tool in pharmacological research. Mode of action PDE4 hydrolyzes cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to inactive adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Inhibition of PDE4 blocks hydrolysis of cAMP, thereby increasing levels of cAMP within cells.

The newly built hotel opened in 1937 and became one of the first modernist buildings in Belgrade with Streamline Moderne elements, applying a minimalist fa√ßade design and relying on simple geometric lines rather than ornate decorations. The building has since been given the status as a significant architectural milestone in Serbian architecture. Basing its business model on the increasing amount of business travel in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's developing economy, the hotel was a family-run enterprise with approximately 80 guest rooms, a restaurant, bar, and purpose- built architect's studio for the owner Ninkoviƒá's son-in-law, architect Savkoviƒá. The hotel stretches over 3,600m2 and is located in central Belgrade next to the main railway station. Djurdje S. Ninkoviƒá died in November 1940, and his wife Jelena, son, Milorad Ninkoviƒá, and daughter, Nina Savkoviƒá inherited the hotel and continued running the business.

Instead, the government based the tender auction on the current privatization law, setting the hotel's initial price at ‚Ç¨1.2 million.

On 9 March, the Politika daily published an op-ed commentary by ƒêurƒëe Ninkoviƒá who disputed the Serbian government's inherited legal basis to handle Hotel Astoria, invoking a communist era law ('law on nationalization of leased buildings and construction land for commercial exploitation') that came into effect on 1 January 1959. Among other things, he stated: \\"I invite everyone to try and derive their own conclusion about the fairness, legality, and finally, the price of the accepted bid at the auction that took place this past Friday. I only want to say that the hotel owners, represented by myself, would've never sold the hotel at that price. I remind everyone that Hotel Astoria was unlawfully nationalized and that the state never had a legal basis to make decisions about the hotel. Furthermore, all deadlines for the compensation payout because of nationalization are long overdue, and the last legally-set 50-year nationalization payout deadline expired on 1 January 2009 and since the state never paid the compensation in that timeframe it therefore forfeited the right to own that property, which it acquired illegally in the first place.... There are ongoing court cases in front of the Municipal Court and the Supreme Court. I'm going to invest all of my skill and experience, obtained over the 40 years of practicing law in Belgrade and London, in order to see justice done at those court cases by obtaining a court decision confirming the right of the Ninkoviƒá family to run Hotel Astoria\\".Borba za ‚ÄûAstoriju‚Äù se nastavlja;Politika, 9 March 2009 The new owner closed Hotel Astoria in July 2009 for renovations.

It was also the site where the Democratic Party's first political program was published in January 1990, and the site of the preparations for founding party conference held in February of that year. Following the founding party conference, the Democratic Party had its first central office in the hotel between February and October, 1990. Mr Ninkovic's office in Hotel Astoria was also the home of the first central office of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) for several months from July 1992, after a centre-right pro DEPOS coalition faction split from the Democratic Party to form the Democratic Party of Serbia (See Vox Iuris, December 2009).

The main plot is always to find items to advance to higher chapters. Also, there are items called \\"puzzle pieces\\" which allow interaction with other characters, items, and animals. In the first two games, the objects are broken down into pieces and scattered throughout the different sections of chapters. In the third and fourth games the only difference is that pieces are not broken down, making it more like an I spy game. As of 2013, all released games in this series have been ported to the iPad, and the first game has additionally been ported to Nintendo Wii. The games are: \\\\- Mortimer Beckett and the Secrets of Spooky Manor, in which Mortimer helps his uncle to get rid of ghosts, by retrieving pieces of the Ghost Machine which have been hidden all over the manor. The cut scenes are 2D and read like a comic book. \\\\- Mortimer Beckett and the Time Paradox, in which Mortimer has to travel through time to retrieve pieces of a timebomb that fell through a portal in his uncle's manor. The cut scenes are 2D, in which Mortimer falls into the next time zone. \\\\- Mortimer Beckett and the Lost King, in which Mortimer wakes up from his final travel through the time portal from the Time Paradox game and learns he has to find the eight jewels of a powerful crown, with which he can locate the kingdom's lost king. The cut scenes are 3D, in which Mortimer walks towards the next scene. \\\\- Mortimer Beckett and the Crimson Thief Finally home after his journey, Mortimer resumes his simple life and peruses the daily newspaper. He finds that a mysterious figure named the Crimson Thief has been stealing valuable art pieces from all over the globe, while eluding the police at every turn. Mortimer jumps on the case and is determined to find the stolen goods. Mortimer travels all over the world to recover stolen items: Paris, Rio de Janeiro, London and other destinations, looking for usable items, solving puzzles, and meeting and assisting the locals. At the end of the game, the song \\"Mickey\\" by Toni Basil is played with a cutscene in which Mortimer is dancing with cheerleaders. \\\\- Mortimer Beckett and the Book of Gold Released in 2017. In this game, Mortimer goes on another adventure, joining with Kate O'Malley of Delicious (game series).

Life  Vera Broido was born in St Petersburg in 1907, the daughter of two Russian Jewish revolutionaries. In 1914, when Broido was seven, her family was plunged into a life of isolation and fear when her mother, prominent Menshevik Eva Broido, was sentenced to exile in Western Siberia for taking a stand against the war. The memory of her stay in Siberia and her experiences there never left her. Broido left the wastes of Siberia for Germany, thanks to the efforts of her father Mark. She never saw her mother after Eva returned voluntarily to the Social-Democratic Party underground in Russia in 1927, and was later told that she had been executed. During her time in Berlin in the 1920s, Broido met avant garde artist and Dadaist turned society photographer Raoul Hausmann and became his lover and muse, living in a m√©nage √† trois with him and his wife Hedwig in the fashionable Charlottenburg district of Berlin between 1928 and 1934. In 1941, Broido married British historian Norman Cohn. They had one son Nik Cohn, who went on to become a writer. When she came to the UK with her new husband, Broido carved a niche for herself among Russian emigres and went on to write books on women in revolution, the Mensheviks and her strongest work, an autobiography looking back on her childhood in Russia and her journey through Europe to the UK. After a stay in Derry in Northern Ireland, she later made her home in London and then in Wood End, Hertfordshire. She died peacefully in 2004 at the age of 97 in Stevenage, England.

Onomastics links him to the Danish royal family since the name \\"Halfdan\\" was commonly employed both historically (as attested by the Annales Fuldenses under the year 873) and in the legendary royal lineage.Simon Coupland (1998), \\"From Poachers to Gamekeepers: Scandinavian Warlords and Carolingian Kings\\", Early Medieval Europe, 7(1): 87. Halfdan was the envoy sent by King Sigfred to the court of the Frankish emperor Charlemagne in 782, as recorded in the Frankish chronicle Annales regni Francorum. An anonymous Saxon poet praising Charlemagne in Latin epic verse mentions Halfdan's commendation to the emperor in the year 807:Quoted in Coupland, 87, with translation in note 8. {  :Northmannorum dux, Alfdeni dictus, / Augusto magno sese comitante caterva / Subdidit, atque fidem studuit firmare perennem.  :A leader of the Northmen, called Halfdan, submitted to the great Emperor, accompanied by a host of others and strove to keep lasting faith. } Although the Saxon poet wrote much later in the century, his poem is generally based on trustworthy sources like the Annales regni Francorum and this section is probably derived from a now lost earlier source. There is no record of Halfdan after 807 and he probably died not long thereafter, possibly already old at the time. A conversion to Christianity on Halfdan's part is not recorded, nor is a gift of land or a fief, but his son Hemming did convert and was probably ruling Frisia in 837. It is possible that this Frisian fief had been inherited from his father.Coupland, 87‚Äì88. If the identification of Hemming as a son of Halfdan is correct, then Halfdan was also the father of Anulo, Harald Klak and Reginfrid, all of whom were, for brief periods, co-rulers of Denmark.

As the number of Hebrew literates was limited at the time, the circle of readership of the newspaper was rather limited. However, the publication of the newspaper contributed to enhancing the status of Hebrew in the Jewish community.Schechtman, Joseph B. The Life and Times of Vladimar Jabotinsky. Silver Spring, MD: Eshel Books, 1986. pp. 155-157 Hamevasser was distributed in various parts of the Ottoman empire and beyond, reaching Greece, Bulgaria, Tunisia and Morocco. Hamevasser was produced by a small circle of Zionist journalists, and was edited by S. Hochberg.Parfitt, Tudor, and Yulia Egorova. Jews, Muslims, and Mass Media: Mediating the Other. London: RoutledgeCurzon, 2004. p. 28 Hamevasser had three sister newspapers, the French weekly L'Aurore, the Judeo-Spanish weekly El Judeo and the French daily Courier d'Orient/Jeune Turc (which was not an explicitly Jewish publication, but directed to a broader readership). Vladimir Jabotinsky functioned as the key organizer of this Zionist media network. A press committee for the four newspapers consisted of Jabotinsky, Hochberg and Jacobson. Jabotinsky contributed with several articles to Hamevasser. Generally, the news-coverage in Hamevasser were concentrated around Jewish and Turkish affairs, the affairs of the Ottoman empire and Jewish-Turkish-Ottoman relations.Landau, Jacob M. Exploring Ottoman and Turkish History. London: Hurst, 2004. p. 367 Politically, Hamevasser was generally supportive of the constitutionalist rule established after the Young Turks revolution of 1908 and its liberal-oriented reforms. Hamevasser welcomed the introduction of conscription of non-Muslims into the Ottoman army, and argued that Jewish youth should enroll as a means to improve Jewish-Turkish relations. Regarding Palestine, it argued that Zionist settlement to Palestine was economically favourable for the development of the Ottoman empire.Parfitt, Tudor, and Yulia Egorova. Jews, Muslims, and Mass Media: Mediating the Other. London: RoutledgeCurzon, 2004. pp. 29-30 Hamevasser rebutted claims circulated by other contemporary press outlets (such as Alemdar), which stated that Zionism was anti-Turkish. Regarding the language question Hamevasser argued in favour of having Hebrew as the first language in Jewish schools, stating that Hebrew was the Jewish national language. It consciously favoured Hebrew over Judeo- Spanish.Landau, Jacob M. Exploring Ottoman and Turkish History. London: Hurst, 2004. p. 371 Turkish or Arabic (depending on which part in the empire the school would be located) were proposed as secondary languages.

He is included in the traditional list of patriarchs of the Church of the East.  Sources  Brief accounts of Isaac's reign are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (floruit 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century), Amr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century). In all these accounts he is anachronistically called 'catholicus', a term that was only applied to the primates of the Church of the East towards the end of the fifth century.  Isaac's reign  Isaac's reign was noteworthy for a Council held in Seleucia-Ctesiphon in 410, brokered by the Byzantine envoy Marutha of Maiperqat, at which the Church of the East accepted the decisions of the Council of Nicaea (325). The synod also recognised Isaac as 'grand metropolitan' and primate of the Church of the East, and organised the Persian dioceses into a number of Roman-style metropolitan provinces. The following account of Isaac's reign is given by Bar Hebraeus: > After Qayyoma, Isaac. He was a native of Kashkar, a very noble and virtuous > man, from the family of the catholicus Tuhma Tomarsa. After the bishops > consecrated him, they enjoined him to behave as an obedient son to the > elderly Qayyoma, and to do nothing without his advice and approval. Isaac > did so. He showed great deference to Qayyoma, and fawned upon him until he > died, after which he became the sole ruler of the church. > In the year 671 of the Greeks [AD 350], in the time of Theodosius the Great, > a synod of 150 bishops was gathered at Constantinople, in which Macedonius > of Constantinople was deposed, who blasphemed against the Holy Spirit by > asserting that he was a created being. Then Marutha of Maiperqat was again > sent to Yazdegerd in the eleventh year of his reign, and used the occasion > to inform the catholicus Isaac of the reason for this synod. And Isaac > gathered together forty of his own bishops, who as vigilant guardians of the > faith assented to the deposition of Macedonius. Marutha prescribed admirable > canons for them, and taught the Easterners how discipline should most > rightly be ordered.

The smartphone launched on June 4, 2010 and was the first 4G enabled smartphone released in the United States.  History  During development, the device was known as the HTC \\"Supersonic\\", which was leaked through the Internet and was known as a variant of the HTC HD2 running Android. The EVO was released on June 4, 2010 in the United States through Sprint. The device became the top-selling launch day phone on Sprint, surpassing the Palm Pre, Samsung Instinct and Motorola Razr V3.  Features  The HTC EVO features hardware very similar to the HTC HD2, a smartphone running Windows Mobile. The device is sometimes referenced as the Android version of the HTC HD2 although a variety of features are only available on the EVO 4G (video calling for example). = Screen and input = The EVO proved a trendsetter among Android phones. Unlike many other smart-phones at the time of its release, the EVO has a large 4.3-inches (480-by-800) TFT LCD capacitive touch screen display with a pixel density of 217 pixels per inch (ppi). Larger sizes are commonplace now, but in mid-2010, this was quite innovative. The display is designed to be used with a bare finger or multiple fingers at one time for multi-touch sensing. Most gloves and styli prevent the necessary electric conductivity needed for use on the capacitive display. The EVO has a balanced hardware-software user interface, featuring seven hardware/touch sensitive buttons, four of which are on the front of the device. Input and interaction with the device is balanced between the hardware and software user interface and in most situations require users to use hardware/touch sensitive buttons often throughout Android OS. Like most Gingerbread era Android devices, the EVO features four main touch-sensitive buttons on the front ‚Äî Home, Menu, Back, and Search. The Home button returns to the Sense Home screen. The Menu button shows menu options in various applications although it can also be used for other purposes, the Back button is used to return to the prior page or screen displayed, and the Search button mainly allows searching through the phone but can be used for other purposes in various applications. Unlike iPhones, the device does not feature a hardware ringer switch.Jenn K. Lee, How to quickly silence your HTC EVO 4G, Good and EVO, 3 June 2010. The volume adjustment control is located on the right spine. A multifunction sleep/wake button is located on the top of the device, which serves as the unit's power and sleep button and also controls phone calls. The touchscreen furnishes the remainder of the user interface. The device responds to four sensors. A proximity sensor deactivates the display and touchscreen when the device is brought near the face during a call. This is done to save battery power and to prevent inadvertent inputs via users' faces and ears. An ambient light sensor adjusts the display brightness, which in turn saves battery power. A 3-axis accelerometer senses the orientation of the phone and changes the screen accordingly, allowing users to easily switch between page orientation modes. A geomagnetism sensor provides orientation with respect to Earth's magnetic field. The proximity sensor and the accelerometer can also be used to control and/or interact with third party apps, notably games. The device also contains a temperature sensor used for monitoring the temperature of the battery. The device also features a GPS chip, allowing applications (with user permission) to report device location allowing for location-based services and can also be useful to turn-by-turn navigation apps. = Processor and memory = The EVO is powered by the Qualcomm QSD8650 chipset that contains a Snapdragon Scorpion microprocessor clocked at 1 GHz and an embedded Adreno 200 graphics chip capable of up to 22 million triangles per second. It features 512 MB of eDRAM, which allows for a smoother experience with Android OS, applications, and the HTC Sense user interface. The device also features 1024 MB of built-in ROM that is mainly used for the system software. = Cameras = The EVO features a rear-facing backside illumination 8-megapixel camera capable of recording videos in 720p at 30 frames per second and dual photoflash, which helps to illuminate objects in low-light conditions. In addition, the EVO has a 1.3-megapixel camera on front of the device designed for use with video calling and for taking portrait images, although it can also be used in other applications. The front facing camera does not work on any versions of Android higher than 2.3.7 Gingerbread. = Storage = Like many other Android mobile devices, the HTC EVO 4G features a microSD slot in addition to the built-in ROM that allows for user-expandable storage. The device supports microSD cards of sizes up to 32 GB. With Android version 2.2+ (Froyo) available as an over-the-air upgrade, the OS supports applications that permit themselves to be installed on the SD card. The device comes pre-installed with an 8 GB microSDHC card of Class 2 or 4. =Audio and output= The rear of the EVO sports a speaker that is used for most applications like music, applications, and such as the main speaker. A loudspeaker that serves as an earpiece is located above the screen. The microphone is featured on the bottom of the phone and is used for phone calls and voice-commands, although it can also be used in many other third-party applications. The unit has an HDMI-out (type D, micro connector) port, which allows sending content to an HD television set. The Sprint Mobile Hotspot application allows sharing the device's mobile broadband with up to eight devices. = Smartphone connectivity = The EVO features a CDMA cellular radio that supports 3G EVDO, Revisions 0, A, and the yet-undeployed B allowing faster download and upload speeds, greater power efficiency; and WiMAX, a protocol known as 802.16e, featuring speeds of up to 10 Mbit/s on the downlink and 1.5 Mbit/s on the uplink. The device is marketed as a 4G phone, WiMAX is considered to be a 4G technology based on 4G standards recently set by ITU-R. 4G for this device does not work on Android versions above 2.3.7 Gingerbread. = Battery and power = The device comes pre-installed with a 1500 mAh Li- ion rechargeable battery that is designed to be user-replaceable. The battery is interchangeable with batteries from the HTC Incredible, HTC Touch Pro 2, HTC Arrive, and HTC Hero (CDMA). Stand by for the pre installed battery is 146 hr. and talk time is 5hr.12 min. Software The device sports the HTC Sense user interface that runs on top of the Android operating system and presents information through the Android desktop widgets and application, and includes launchers, app drawer, and lock screen replacements. Sense also brings a modified browser and home screen as well. The device first came with Android OS 2.1 \\"Eclair\\" although Android OS 2.2 \\"Froyo\\" has since been rolled out through OTA (Over-The-Air) making it the third device to officially run \\"Froyo\\" and the first to be officially rolled out by a US network. Exactly a year after the phone's official release, the EVO received an update to Android 2.3.3 (Gingerbread). The software could be manually installed by searching for a software update, and began being pushed to HTC EVOs across Sprint on June 6, 2011. Improvements aside from the upgraded Android OS include a fix for battery issues, increases battery life, includes the ability to sync multiple Gmail accounts, and a few user interface tweaks. A second update was pushed by Sprint on June 20, 2011, fixing magnetometer (compass) issues, Netflix streaming, voicemail notifications, and hearing aid compatibility. The EVO has also seen support from the developer community with Android versions including Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0, Jelly Bean 4.1 - 4.3, and finally KitKat 4.4, some of which are available with HTC Sense while other available versions are based on stock Android. As of the end of 2016, there is very little, if any, support from the community due to the age of the device and the fact that it is nearly impossible to run newer versions of Android (5.0+) on this device. = Interface = In HTC Sense, the interface is based around home screen panels which in total are seven panels that allows user-customization. By default, the center home screen panel features a digital clock located on the top of the screen and weather animations of the current weather in the device's location, the remaining space in the bottom can be customized to user preferences. The launcher, located at the bottom of the screen, displays icons to open the App Drawer, Phone application, and the ability to add widgets on the Android desktop, and is shown throughout all seven home screen panels. Users can switch from one panel to another by sliding left or right. A small bar that sits on top of the launcher represents the current panel the device is viewing. Pinching the home screen (or pressing the home button if the user is on the center panel) brings up Leap screen, showing thumbnail views of all the home screen panels and allowing users to \\"leap\\" to another home screen panel easily. Unlike other custom user interfaces for the Android OS like Samsung's TouchWiz UI, HTC Sense does not allow disabling or removing a panel. Most of the input on the device is given through the touchscreen, which understands complex gestures using multi-touch. Android's interaction techniques enable moving up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. However the buttons on the front of the device will also require frequent use throughout various applications in Android OS as the buttons play an important part in the user interface.  Criticism  = 30 frames per second cap = Some users have experienced noticeable graphics lag and/or slowness while using the phone. Various reports throughout the Internet indicated that the device may have a 30 frames per second cap. An HTC representative announced that it was a hardware cap, not subject to software updates. Despite the repeated claims regarding the supposed hardware cap, HTC released an update on September 22, 2010 that, among other things, removed the 30 FPS cap. Evo 4G screen defects = Screen = There have been many problems with the screen. Some of the first customers complained of screen separation; HTC acknowledged the problem and was able to limit the number of affected units. Another problem with the screen has been a bright spot in the lower area of the screen. This problem is commonly referred to as the B-spot because it is exactly where the B on the keyboard is. This bright spot is only noticeable when using a bright background. The B-spot is also noticeable when screen display is set to automatic brightness. = Device clock reference = The device clock is 15 seconds faster than Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), either with Android 2.1, 2.2 or 2.3; a manual clock setting does not override seconds, and root authority would be needed to overcome issue using Network Time Protocol (ntp) software. The 15-second offset hints the number of leap seconds introduced since GPS inception in 1980 rather than an epoch issue and was reported as an Android bug on Dec 16, 2009. Certain phones running Android including Samsung EPIC do not exhibit the issue, possibly because firmware fetches UTC value rather than GPS from Network time, or subtracts leap second offset. Sprint, HTC, OHA, Google and goodandevo.net were informed of the aforesaid issue earlier than October 2010, reported as Android bug 5485. HTC update 3.70.651.1 released on 2010-12-15 still did not overcome the issue, and neither did build 4.22.651.2 (Android 2.3.3) released on 2011-06-03. Finally, on 2012-01-19, HTC software update 4.67.651.3 overcame the issue, just a week before the end of life for the EVO was announced. = Battery life = Users have complained that the battery life for the Evo is inadequate and incapable of lasting one day of normal use. This has spawned the creation of pages dedicated to explaining how to optimize the battery life, and even an aftermarket extra large battery that enlarges the unit. In addition, there is a software error that causes a severely depleted battery to become unable to be charged in the phone. The OTA upgrade to Android 2.3.3 fixes this issue along with improving device battery life on the whole.  Design  The EVO's design is derived from its Windows Mobile-based brother, the HTC HD2, which also has a multi-touch capacitive touchscreen, nearly the same slim profile, and the same placements of most general components and buttons. Although similar, the EVO has features that distinguish it from the HTC HD2 including the front-facing camera, the circular-shaped rear camera, an integrated Kickstand, and touch-sensitive buttons instead of hardware buttons. Another feature is Android-specific buttons. The device has nearly the same dimensions, namely high wide deep.  Warranty  The phone comes with a one-year warranty, which does not cover scratches, cracks, smudge marks, liquid damage, and other forms of physical damage. Sending phones for repair is typically handled by the phone service provider, rather than through HTC.

Coryell, 6 Fed. Cas. 546 (1823), freedom of movement has been judicially recognized as a fundamental Constitutional right. In Paul v. Virginia, 75 U.S. 168 (1869), the Court defined freedom of movement as \\"right of free ingress into other States, and egress from them.\\" However, the Supreme Court did not invest the federal government with the authority to protect freedom of movement. Under the \\"privileges and immunities\\" clause, this authority was given to the states, a position the Court held consistently through the years in cases such as Ward v. Maryland, 79 U.S. 418 (1871), the Slaughter-House Cases, 83 U.S. 36 (1873) and United States v. Harris, 106 U.S. 629 (1883).Duster, Michael J. \\"Criminal Justice System Reform Symposium: Note: Out of Sight, Out of Mind: State Attempts to Banish Sex Offenders.\\" Drake Law Review. 53:711 (Spring 2005).\\"Note: Membership Has Its Privileges and Immunities: Congressional Power to Define and Enforce the Rights of National Citizenship.\\" Harvard Law Review. 102:1925 (June 1989). Travel within the United States =Constitutional freedom= As early as the Articles of Confederation the Congress recognized freedom of movement (Article 4), though the right was thought to be so fundamental during the drafting of the Constitution as not needing explicit enumeration. Mount, Steve; \\"Things That Are Not In the U.S. Constitution\\" The U.S. Supreme Court in Crandall v. Nevada, declared that freedom of movement is a fundamental right and therefore a state cannot inhibit people from leaving the state by taxing them. In United States v. Wheeler, 254 U.S. 281 (1920), the Supreme Court reiterated its position that the Constitution did not grant the federal government the power to protect freedom of movement. However, Wheeler had a significant impact in other ways. For many years, the roots of the Constitution's \\"privileges and immunities\\" clause had only vaguely been determined.Bogen, David Skillen. Privileges and Immunities: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution. Westport, Ct.: Praeger Press, 2003. In 1823, the circuit court in Corfield had provided a list of the rights (some fundamental, some not) which the clause could cover.Wadley, James B. \\"Indian Citizenship and the Privileges and Immunities Clauses of the United States Constitution: An Alternative to the Problems of the Full Faith and Credit and Comity?\\" Southern Illinois University Law Journal. 31:31 (Fall 2006).Dunlap, Frank L. \\"Constitutional Law: Power of States to Prevent Entry of Paupers from Other States.\\" California Law Review. 26:5 (July 1938). The Wheeler court dramatically changed this. It was the first to locate the right to travel in the privileges and immunities clause, providing the right with a specific guarantee of constitutional protection.Foscarinis, Maria. \\"Downward Spiral: Homelessness and Its Criminalization.\\" Yale Law & Policy Review. 14:1 (1996). By reasoning that the clause derived from Article IV of the Articles of Confederation, the decision suggested a narrower set of rights than those enumerated in Corfield, but also more clearly defined those rights as absolutely fundamental.Nelson, William E. The Fourteenth Amendment: From Political Principle to Judicial Doctrine. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1988. The Supreme Court began rejecting Wheeler's reasoning within a few years. Finally, in United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745 (1966), the Supreme Court overruled Chief Justice White's conclusion that the federal government could protect the right to travel only against state infringement.United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 759, n.16. The Supreme Court has specifically ruled that Crandall does not imply a right to use any particular mode of travel, such as driving an automobile. In Hendrick v. Maryland (1915), the appellant asked the Court to void Maryland's motor vehicle statute as a violation of the freedom of movement. The Court found \\"no solid foundation\\" for the appellant's argument and unanimously held that \\"in the absence of national legislation covering the subject, a state may rightfully prescribe uniform regulations necessary for public safety and order in respect to the operation upon its highways of all motor vehicles ‚Äî those moving in interstate commerce as well as others.\\" The U.S. Supreme Court also dealt with the right to travel in the case of Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489 (1999). In that case, Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the majority, held that the United States Constitution protected three separate aspects of the right to travel among the states: (1) the right to enter one state and leave another (an inherent right with historical support from the Articles of Confederation), (2) the right to be treated as a welcome visitor rather than a hostile stranger (protected by the \\"Privileges and Immunities\\" clause in Article IV, ¬ß 2), and (3) (for those who become permanent residents of a state) the right to be treated equally to native-born citizens (this is protected by the 14th Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause; citing the majority opinion in the Slaughter-House Cases, Justice Stevens said, \\"the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . . . has always been common ground that this Clause protects the third component of the right to travel.\\"). =Mann Act= The 1910 Mann Act (White-Slave Traffic Act) among other things banned the interstate transport of females for otherwise undefined \\"immoral purposes\\", which were taken to include consensual extramarital sex. This act was used, in addition to less controversial cases, to allow federal prosecution of unmarried couples who had for some reason come to the attention of the authorities; interracial couples (e.g. boxer Jack Johnson) and people with left-wing views (e.g. Charlie Chaplin) were prosecuted. The Act has since been amended to be gender-neutral and now applies only to sexual activity which is separately illegal (such as prostitution and sex with a minor). =Implications= The Court's establishment of a strong constitutional right to freedom of movement has had far-reaching effects. For example, the Supreme Court overturned state prohibitions on welfare payments to individuals who had not resided within the jurisdiction for at least one year as an impermissible burden on the right to travel (Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618 (1969)). The Court has also struck down one-year residency requirements for voting in state elections (Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330 (1972)), one-year waiting periods before receiving state-provided medical care (Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, 415 U.S. 250 (1974)), civil service preferences for state veterans (Attorney Gen. of New York v. Soto-Lopez, 476 U.S. 898 (1986)), but upheld higher fishing and hunting license fees for out-of-state residents (Baldwin v. Fish and Game Commission of Montana, 436 U.S. 371 (1978)).Porter, Andrew C. \\"Comment: Toward a Constitutional Analysis of the Right to Intrastate Travel.\\" Northwestern University Law Review. 86:820 (1992).Zubler, Todd. \\"The Right to Migrate and Welfare Reform: Time for Shapiro v. Thompson to Take A Hike.\\" Valparaiso University Law Review. 31:893 (Summer 1997). Current US Code addresses air travel specifically. In , \\"Sovereignty and use of airspace\\", the Code specifies that \\"A citizen of the United States has a public right of transit through the navigable airspace.\\" A strong right to freedom of movement may yet have even farther-reaching implications. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that freedom of movement is closely related to freedom of association and to freedom of expression. Strong constitutional protection for the right to travel may have significant implications for state attempts to limit abortion rights, ban or refuse to recognize same-sex marriage, and enact anti-crime or consumer protection laws. It may even undermine current Court-fashioned concepts of federalism.Simon, Harry. \\"Towns Without Pity: A Constitutional and Historical Analysis of Official Efforts to Drive Homeless Persons From American Cities.\\" Tulane Law Review. 66:631 (March 1992).Kreimer, Seth F. \\"The Law of Choice and Choice of Law: Abortion, the Right to Travel, and Extraterritorial Regulation in American Federalism.\\" New York University Law Review. 67:451 (June 1992).Rosen, Mark D. \\"Extraterritoriality and Political Heterogeneity in American Federalism.\\" University of Pennsylvania Law Review. 150:855 (January 2002).Kreimer, Seth F. \\"Territoriality and Moral Dissensus: Thoughts on Abortion, Slavery, Gay Marriage and Family Values.\\" Bridgeport Law Review/Quinnipiac Law Review. 16:161 (Spring/Summer 1996).Hemmens, Craig and Bennett, Katherine. \\"Out in the Street: Juvenile Crime, Juvenile Curfews, and the Constitution.\\" Gonzaga Law Review. 34:267 (1998/1999). =Free speech zones= A related issue deals with free speech zones designated during political protests. Although such zones were in use by the 1960s and 1970 due to the Vietnam-era protests, they were not widely reported in the media. However, the controversy over their use resurfaced during the 2001-2009 Bush presidency. In essence, Free Speech Zones prevent a person from having complete mobility as a consequence of their exercising their right to speak freely. Courts have accepted time, place, and manner restrictions on free speech in the United States, but such restrictions must be narrowly tailored, and free speech zones have been the subject of lawsuits. International travel =History= From 1776 to 1783, no state government had a passport requirement. The Articles of Confederation government (1783‚Äì1789) did not have a passport requirement. From 1789 through late 1941, the government established under the Constitution required United States passports of citizens only during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865) and during and shortly after World War I (1914‚Äì1918). The passport requirement of the Civil War era lacked statutory authority. After the outbreak of World War I, passports were required by executive order, of ; of . though there was no statutory authority for the requirement. The Travel Control Act of May 22, 1918 permitted the president, when the United States was at war, to proclaim a passport requirement, and a proclamation was issued on August 18, 1918. of Though World War I ended on November 11, 1918, the passport requirement lingered until March 3, 1921.Act of May 22, 1918, ; Proc. No. 1473, ; Act of March 3, 1921, . There was an absence of a passport requirement under United States law between 1921 and 1941. World War II (1939‚Äì1945) again led to passport requirements under the Travel Control Act of 1918. A 1978 amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 made it illegal to enter or depart the United States without an issued passport even in peacetime.Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280 (1981). ¬ß 707(b) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1979 (), amended ¬ß 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 making it unlawful to enter or depart the United States without a passport even in peacetime. Note that the amendment does permit the President to make exceptions; historically, these exceptions have been used to permit travel to certain countries (particularly Canada) without a passport. As of 2016-08-10, tourism sites still discuss which alternative documents are acceptable, and which ceased to be sufficient in 2007 or 2008.http://www.wildernessisland.com/CanadaUSBorder.php#.V6tkwvkrI-U =Restrictions= As per ¬ß 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (currently codified at ), it is unlawful for a United States citizen to enter or exit the United States without a valid United States passport. As per Haig v. Agee and the Passport Act of 1926 (currently codified at et seq.), the Presidential administration may deny or revoke passports for foreign policy or national security reasons at any time. The Secretary of State has historically in times of peace refused passports for one of three reasons: citizenship or loyalty, criminal conduct, or when the applicant was seeking to \\"escape the toils of law.\\" Laws and regulations on restricting passports have generally been categorized as personal restrictions or area restrictions and have generally been justified for national security or foreign policy reasons. Perhaps the most notable example of enforcement of this ability was the 1948 denial of a passport to U.S. Representative Leo Isacson, who sought to go to Paris to attend a conference as an observer for the American Council for a Democratic Greece, a Communist front organization, because of the group's role in opposing the Greek government in the Greek Civil War.Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280 (1981), at 302 In Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116 (1958), the United States Secretary of State had refused to issue a passport to an American citizen based on the suspicion that the plaintiff was going abroad to promote communism (personal restrictions/national security). Although the Court did not reach the question of constitutionality in this case, the Court, in an opinion by Justice William O. Douglas, held that the federal government may not restrict the right to travel without due process: :The right to travel is a part of the 'liberty' of which the citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment. If that \\"liberty\\" is to be regulated, it must be pursuant to the law-making functions of the Congress. . . . . Freedom of movement across frontiers in either direction, and inside frontiers as well, was a part of our heritage. Travel abroad, like travel within the country, . . . may be as close to the heart of the individual as the choice of what he eats, or wears, or reads. Freedom of movement is basic in our scheme of values. Six years later, the Court struck down a federal ban restricting travel by communists (Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U.S. 500 (1964))(personal restrictions, national security, First Amendment). But the court struggled to find a way to protect national interests (such as national security) in light of these decisions. Just a year after Aptheker, the Supreme Court fashioned the rational basis test for constitutionality in Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U.S. 1 (1965) (area restrictions, foreign policy), as a way of reconciling the rights of the individual with the interests of the state.Mode, Gregory J. \\"Comment: Wisconsin, A Constitutional Right to Intrastate Travel, and Anti-Cruising Ordinances.\\" Marquette Law Review. 78:735 (Spring 1995). =Restrictions as punishment= The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), codified at 42 USC 652(k), saw the beginning of restrictions on freedom of movement as a punishment for child support debtors. Constitutional challenges to these restrictions have thus far failed in Weinstein v. Albright and Eunique v. Powell. Federal Appeals Courts in the Second and Ninth Circuits, although expressing due process concerns, have held that collection of child support is an important government interest, that the right to travel internationally was not a fundamental right and that laws restricting this right need not pass strict scrutiny. In a dissenting opinion in Eunique, Judge Andrew Kleinfeld categorized the measure as a punishment for unpaid debts. \\"This passport ban is more reasonably seen, in light of the penalties the states are required to impose for nonpayment of child support ... not as a means of facilitating collection, but as a penalty for past nonpayment.\\" \\"All debtors should pay their debts. Debts for child support have special moral force. But that does not justify tossing away a constitutional liberty so important that it has been a constant of Anglo-American law since Magna Carta, and of civilized thought since Plato.\\" A number of constitutional scholars and advocates for reform strongly oppose restricting the human right to travel for a person who has committed no crime, and assert that the practice violates basic constitutional rights. Similarly, anyone claimed to be in arrears on child support can have certain types of vehicular driver's license revoked or suspended, severely restricting their freedom to travel. Critics point to cases where the lapse in support payments was caused by loss of employment yet the response of revoking the right to freely travel by car further impedes the ability to resume payments by limiting the ability to find employment and travel to a workplace. International Bill of Human Rights  The International Bill of Human Rights is an informal name given to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (adopted in 1948), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966) with its two Optional Protocols, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966). Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads: :(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each State. :(2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country. Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights incorporates this right into treaty law: :(1) Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence. :(2) Everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own. :(3) The above-mentioned rights shall not be subject to any restrictions except those provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre publique), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other rights recognized in the present Covenant. :(4) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country.

Emil M. Herman (1879‚Äì1928) was a German-American socialist and anti-war activist. A three-time candidate for Congress on the ticket of the Socialist Party of America, Herman is best remembered for his imprisonment by the Wilson administration due to his political activity in the outspokenly anti-war Socialist Party of America during World War I. Biography =Early years= Emil M. Herman was born August 22, 1879, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire town of Kamnitz (now part of the Czech Republic), the son of a farmer of ethnic German extraction.Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole (eds.), The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pp. 102-103. The family emigrated to the United States in 1882, settling first in Alexander, Arkansas before moving to Kansas City, Missouri, where Emil attended grammar school. Herman's education came to an abrupt end at an early age, however, as he was forced by economic circumstances to drop out of school to go to work to help support the family at age 11. Herman moved to Washington state in 1890, setting near Lyman, Washington.\\"Workingman's Platform and Ticket,\\" The Socialist [Seattle], whole no. 187 (March 6, 1904), pg. 3. He worked variously as a lumberman, a farmer, and a baker. In 1922 he became a member of the Bakers Union. =Political career= Herman joined the Socialist Labor Party (SLP) in 1897 and was a member of Section Woolley, Washington.Emil Herman, letter to the editor of The Socialist, vol. 5, no. 27 (February 10, 1901), pg. 2. He remained with the SLP until 1899, when he exited to join instead the Social Democratic Party of America (SDP) headed by Eugene V. Debs and Victor L. Berger. Herman served as the local secretary of Local Lyman] on behalf of his new organization.\\"List of Locals and Secretaries,\\" The Socialist [Seattle], vol. 5, no. 27 (February 10, 1901), pg. 4. When the SDP united with Slobodin and Hillquit's East Coast- based group of former SLP members in 1901 to form the Socialist Party of America (SPA), Herman continued his political activity in that new organization as well. First serving as a local secretary, Herman was first elected as a delegate to the Socialist Party's national convention in 1908. He was also chosen in that capacity to attend the party's conventions of 1917, 1923, and 1924. Herman's first run for political office came in the spring of 1904, when he ran for Seattle City Council on the Socialist Party ticket. He later ran as a Socialist candidate for U.S. Congress in 1906, 1908, and 1909.Lawrence Kestenbaum (ed.), \\"Emil Herman,\\" Political graveyard.com. Retrieved March 23, 2010.

Retrieved March 23, 2010. He was also elected to the governing 15 member National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party of America in 1917, with his term expiring in 1919. Herman was a dual member of the Industrial Workers of the World from 1910 through the early 1920s. On April 30, 1918, Herman was arrested at the Everett, Washington office of the state Socialist Party under the Espionage Act of 1917.Harvey O'Connor, Revolution in Seattle: A Memoir. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1964; pg. 13. He was held pending $20,000 bond, which was eventually provided. While out on bond, Herman was rearrested and his bond was revoked for traveling to Chicago to attend an organizational conference of the IWW. At trial the prosecution produced its evidence against Herman seized in the raid on his office, including the pamphlets The Great Madness, Mental Dynamite, and The Menace of Militarism. Also shown to the jury were \\"disloyal\\" stickers with a quotation falsely attributed to Jack London reading: > \\"Young Man! The lowest aim in your life is to be a good soldier.

[1957]. Westport, CT: > Greenwood Press, 1986; pg. 185. In the wartime climate of superheated nationalism and anti-German sentiment, the German-American socialist organizer Herman was convicted under the Espionage Act of 1917 for possession of these \\"seditious\\" materials and sentenced to 10 years in prison. While serving time at McNeil Island Federal Penitentiary in Washington state, Herman remained a member of the Socialist Party's governing National Executive Committee. He was sharply critical of the decision of the members of the NEC still at liberty to expel the Michigan state Socialist Party and to suspend various foreign language federations supportive of the organized faction known as the Left Wing Section, charging in a letter published in the party press that the NEC had acted without maintaining a quorum and engaged in \\"petty, political trickery\\" by invalidating the 1919 party election and making a major section of the party ineligible for participation in the forthcoming 1919 Emergency National Convention of the party.Emil Herman, \\"Imprisoned Member Protests NEC Action,\\" The New Age [Buffalo, NY], v. 7, no. 369 (June 26, 1919), pg. 7. Herman was pardoned and released on December 24, 1921, after having spent over 3 years and 4 months behind bars. He was unbowed by his prison experience, delivering a speech immediately after his release in which he declared: > \\"I am opposed to war. I object to bloodshed.

Despite being courted by communists through the newly formed Workers Party of America amid his wartime imprisonment, upon his release Herman rejoined the Socialist Party. At the time of his reaffiliation to the SPA, Herman declared in a published article that the Communists had \\"swallowed hook, bait, and line of the programs imposed upon them\\" by \\"agents of the Department of Justice,\\" and thus been driven underground.Emil Herman, \\"Where I Stand ‚Äî And Why,\\" Miami Valley Socialist [Dayton, OH], vol. 10, no. 526 (April 7, 1922), pg. 3. Herman again opened up an office in Everett, where he served as the secretary for the Northwest District for the now-atrophied Socialist Party in the years after his release. =Death and legacy= Emil Herman died October 10, 1928. Emil Herman's wife, Ruby Herman (1885-?), was an activist in the Socialist Party and continued her husband's work as the party's secretary for the Pacific Northwest region for some time after her husband's death. A native of Arkansas, she ran for Congress as a Socialist in 1924 and 1928. The Hermans had two children, Donald R. Herman (born about 1915) and Edwin A. Herman (born about 1922).

Fossils in the position they were found Seitaad is known from an articulated partial postcranial holotype skeleton referred to as UMNH VP 18040. The skeleton is missing its head, neck and tail. It was collected from the Early Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, the uppermost unit of the Glen Canyon Group, dating to the Pliensbachian stage, near Comb Ridge, San Juan County. A phylogenetic study of Seitaad found it to be a plateosaur sauropodomorph, placing it in Massospondylidae or alternatively (a less probable position) in Plateosauridae, but its placement within the Plateosauria is not well understood. In a cladistic analysis, presented by Apaldetti and colleagues in November 2011, Seitaad was found to be within Massopoda, just outside Anchisauria. Seitaad was first described by Joseph J. W. Sertich and Mark A. Loewen in 2010 and the type species is Seitaad ruessi. The generic name is derived from S√©√≠t‚Äò√°√°d (Navajo language), a mythological sand monster from the Din√© folklore who buried its victims in dunes. Seitaad appears to have been entombed by the collapse of a sand dune.

ACF is the name of both the ACF Network, which is run by the Division, and of many individual fellowship groups, which are organized on a local level. The NAD Adventist Christian Fellowship Network was founded in 2005 \\"to build Christian fellowship chapters on public campuses that honor God and nurture the spiritual lives of students in North America\\". Adventist Christian Fellowship groups can be found on public university and other tertiary campuses across the United States, Canada, and beyond. In addition to the NAD Adventist Christian Fellowship Network, the CAMPUS network, a ministry of the Michigan Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, and the Morning Star Christian Fellowship network, a para-church organization, also help to organize Adventist student groups on university and other tertiary campuses. Most CAMPUS and Morning Star groups are also affiliated with the larger ACF Network.  Oceania  The Adventist Students Association (ASA) is the best known Adventist student group in Oceania, and operates primarily in Australia. It runs socials, meetings, Bible studies and outreach. Each year, week-long \\"Convention\\" and \\"Symposium\\" events are held in Australia. ASA is run by students, with support from the church.

Bial is known for the concept of her foundation, which is to send groups of around ten students to collaborating colleges so that they can support each other and achieve a greater success rate. She is also known for the Bial‚ÄìDale College Adaptability Index, an activity-based test of college readiness that incorporates Lego play. She was one of the 2007 winners of the MacArthur \\"Genius\\" awards and is a frequent speaker at college graduations. Life Bial was born in Manhattan and grew up in Teaneck, New Jersey. Her father played bassoon and contrabassoon with the New York Philharmonic and her mother worked as a public relations professional for the New York State Psychiatric Institute. She describes her younger self as shy and not standing out in any way: \\"There was nothing remarkable about me growing up.\\" Her childhood ambition was to become a writer and illustrator of children's books. She attended Brandeis University, graduating in 1987. She worked briefly as a paralegal, and then became a counselor for the CityKids Foundation in New York> After starting Posse, she returned to graduate school, and earned master's and Ed.D. degrees from the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 1996 and 2004, respectively. She delivered the 2012 commencement speech at her alma mater, Brandeis University. She has also been chosen as a commencement speaker at numerous colleges and universities including at DePauw University (2008), at the University of Rochester (2015), at Vassar College (2017), , Kalamazoo College (2018). and at The College of Wooster (2019). Contributions Bial's Posse Foundation sends talented young people from diverse backgrounds in \\"posses\\" of approximately ten students at a time to cooperating universities, with the intention that the students in each posse will support each other. The idea for the foundation came to Bial in 1989 when she was working as a youth counselor in New York City. One student had dropped out of college; when she asked why, he told her that he would have stayed in school if only he had his posse to support him. Based on this experience, she started her foundation as a way to create these posses as support groups for students. As well, she designed the selection process of the foundation to focus on urban students who might otherwise be overlooked by traditional college admissions processes. As well as being known for this concept for the foundation, Bial is known for developing the Bial‚ÄìDale College Adaptability Index, a method for determining whether students are ready for college that avoids written testing in favor of interviews and activity-based assessment. It has been dubbed \\"the Lego test\\" because of its incorporation of play with Lego bricks as one of its components. Awards Besides winning a MacArthur Fellowship in 2007, Bial has been given honorary degrees from many institutions of higher education including Brandeis University (2012), Hamilton College (2014), Colby College (2015), Agnes Scott College (2017), Hobart and William Smith Colleges (2017). and The College of Wooster (2019).

United States. Located at 33 Evans Place in the Pompton Plains section of Pequnnock, the station is a former stop on the Erie Railroad's Greenwood Lake Division (former New York and Greenwood Lake Railway). The station was a single side-platform station with service from Wanaque‚ÄìMidvale station in Wanaque to Pavonia Terminal in Jersey City, where connections were made to ferries to New York City. The next station north was Pompton‚ÄìRiverdale after 1951 (Riverdale station before 1951). The next station south was Pequannock. Service through Pompton Plains began in January 1873 as part of a railroad from Jersey City to Greenwood Lake and Sterling Forest, New Jersey. The station became part of the New York and Greenwood Lake in 1878 and the Erie Railroad in 1896. Service through to Greenwood Lake ended in 1935 and replaced to Wanaque. In October 1963, the station became part of a shuttle line operated by the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad between Wanaque‚ÄìMidvale and Mountain View station in Wayne. Passenger service at Pompton Plains ended on September 30, 1966 as part of several cuts by the Erie-Lackawanna. The station was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 5, 2008. The station serves as the Pequannock Township Museum and was restored in 2010. History James R. Evans was the station agent from the 1870s to turn of the 20th century. Regular passenger train service for the train station ended in 1963, although shuttles from Mountain View remained until 1966. Freight service to the station continued into the 1980s.

His son Gaspard IV also bore the title, and died in 1649. The dukedom was recreated in 1696 for Paul-Sigismond de Montmorency-Luxembourg, son of Fran√ßois-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg. He had inherited the lordship of Ch√¢tillon from his aunt Angelique-Elisabeth de Montmorency, widow of the last duc de Ch√¢tillon.

In 1735 he in turn ceded the dukedom to his son Charles-Anne-Sigismond, who received a similar brevet as duc d'Olonne. On his death in 1777 he was succeeded by his son, Anne-Charles-Sigismond, who had previously inherited the duchy-peerage of Piney-Luxembourg.

History The locomotive was built by the American Locomotive Company in November 1942 for the U.S. War Department. The locomotive is a 0-6-0 \\"Switching\\"-type built for Standard gauge track. The intended use of the locomotive was for U.S. military service in the Far East, Africa and Europe, but instead was used for switching operations for military bases within the United States during World War II. After World War II the locomotive was no longer needed by the War Department and was sold to the Virginia Blue Ridge Railway on February 17, 1947. The locomotive was used in freight operations until August 1, 1963 when it was taken out of service when the Virginia Blue Ridge Railway made the change over to diesel locomotives. In 1965, the locomotive was sold to the Morris County Central Railroad and was used for passenger rail excursions. The locomotive's last run was on December 14, 1980 between Newfoundland and Stockholm, New Jersey. The Whippany Railway Museum acquired the locomotive on May 7, 1994 and cosmetically restored it for static display.

It was first named by Weber in 1910, and is commonly known as the primitive archerfish or Lorentz's archerfish.Australian Faunal DirectoryCommon names for Toxotes lorentzi at www.fishbase.org.  Taxonomy and description  Toxotes lorentzi is believed to range in length from , though a specimens reaching in length have been observed. T. lorentzi normally has five dorsal spines and is a silvery tan or brown colour, with a dark pectoral base. While bars and spots are distinct features of other members of the genus, T. lorentzi usually has no markings, or else very faint bars on its sides. T. lorentzi usually has three gill rakers on the lower limb of its first branchial arch, but two and four are also possible. It usually has fewer than 38 scales on its lateral line. T. lorentzi was described by Max Carl Wilhelm Weber in 1910. It was initially believed that T. lorentzi is the most \\"primitive\\" species of archerfish due to its lack of markings and straight dorsal line, a view that Weber endorsed; Gilbert Whitley, who shared this view, reclassified T. lorentzi under the new monotypic genus Prototoxotes which he erected for it in 1950. However, later authors disputed the assertion that T. lorentzi is more primitive and simply consider Prototoxotes a synonym of Toxotes, where T. lorentzi is usually placed.  Behaviour  Like other archerfish, T. lorentzi feeds on terrestrial insects by shooting a stream of water onto low-hanging vegetation at the edges of streams and capturing the insects as they fall into the water. Such insects are believed to make up a significant portion of its diet.  Distribution and habitat  The range of Toxotes lorentzi includes a handful of areas in the Northern Territory of Australia: the Timor Sea drainage at Yam Creek, the Finniss River, and Sawcut Creek, Deaf Adder Creek, and Baroalba Creek, part of the South Alligator River system. In addition, it is also common in the Fly River Delta. Its range also includes the Balima River and the Merauke River of central southern New Guinea. T. lorentzi generally inhabits swamps and the edges of streams with vegetative cover. It is most commonly observed in surface waters. Because Toxotes lorentzi has wide distribution and no major widespread threats are known, IUCN considers it to be of \\"Least Concern\\".

Dixon Collegiate Professor of Accounting at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan.Faculty Profile of Raffi Indjejikian His research is primarily focused on the development of models and theories illustrating the role of managerial accounting in decision-making through the basis of agency theory. Educational and professional background Indjejikian holds a Bachelor of Commerce and Diploma of Public Accountancy from McGill University in Montreal, an M.B.A. from the University of Western Ontario, and a Ph.D. from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Before gaining a full professorship position at the University of Michigan in September 2000, Indjejikian held Associate Professor positions at the University of Michigan and University of Chicago from July 1992 to August 2000. He was also Assistant Professor, Instructor, and Lecturer at the University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania, and McGill University, respectively.Curriculum Vitae, April 2005 http://www.bus.umich.edu/FacultyBios/CV/raffii.pdf Two-tiered financial reporting Raffi Indjejikian's research on two-tiered financial reporting pertains to the differences between sophisticated and unsophisticated users. Unsophisticated users may lack knowledge and technology to be able to analyze such complicated financial statements and reports. Therefore, a competitive advantage is created for the sophisticated users while unsophisticated users are left with an ‚Äúinformation overload‚Äù. Two-tiered reporting can be damaging to unsophisticated users specifically in situations where important information is being eliminated or when too much information is being extracted.‚ÄúA Model of Two-Tiered Financial Reporting,‚Äù with Robert Bushman and Frank Gigler, Journal of Accounting Research, Supplement 1996. CEO & CFO compensation Another focus of Indjejikian's research is the responsibilities and compensation of CEOs and CFOs of public and private corporations. Several of his papers have examined how firms design their bonus plans for the CFO and CEO and contrast those plans to decision making. The research of these papers was through surveys of members of the American Institute of CPA's. The main findings of these papers were that bonuses are based on the length of executive tenure, size of the firm, and length of the product development and life cycle. The papers also found public companies, relative to private companies have reduced the percentage of bonus based on financial reporting to the extent that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has made firms much more concerned about the integrity of their financial reports and increased the costs of noncompliance.\\"CEO Compensation: The Role of Individual Performance Evaluation,‚Äù with Robert Bushman and Abbie Smith, Journal of Accounting and Economics, Vol. 21 April 1996.\\"CFO Fiduciary responsibilities and Annual Bonus Incentives,\\" Journal of Accounting Research, Vol. 47 Sept 2009. Dynamic incentives and responsibility accounting With Nanda, Indjejikian argues that incentive problems are a crucial aspect of responsibility accounting. Due to the Ratchet effect, the employer would be better off if both parties can agree on a multi-period contract without subsequent revisions. Two responsibility center structures are analyzed: Consolidated structures are produced when managers are attributed to multiple activities. These structures imply less ratcheting but at the loss of comparative performance information. Specialized structures mean managers are responsible for one activity thus providing a higher level of comparative performance information but also a higher level of ratcheting. Performance evaluation in firms with specialized structures is more informative because of the use of comparative measurements.‚ÄúDynamic Incentives and Responsibility Accounting,‚Äù with Dhananjay Nanda, Journal of Accounting and Economics, April 1999.

Plot  In the 1970s, a mental institution near the Finland‚ÄìRussia border was shut down when it was discovered that main administrator Doctor Andersson (who had taken to calling himself \\"The Auteur\\") had filmed himself torturing patients to death. Most of the doctor's films were confiscated, though the rooms in which they were developed and screened were never found. Around thirty years later, the asylum is being used as the set of Silent Creek, a film based on the murders committed in it. While doing recordings, two soundmen hear disembodied voices, and find a hidden room. The chamber contains Andersson's undiscovered work, and while the bulk of the cast and crew of Silent Creek are disgusted by the snuff films, they decide not to call the police, since doing so would shut down production. Steven, the director of Silent Creek, becomes obsessed with Andersson's films (which he is drawn to one night by an apparition) and begins acting deranged, claiming that Silent Creek is \\"not real enough\\". After finding Andersson's camera among the snuff films, Steve tricks Bruce (the actor playing Andersson) into killing an actress with a drill (which he said was just a prop) while he films it. The next day, the rest of the cast and crew find a note on Andersson's projector telling them to turn it on. The projector shows Steven (dressed like Andersson) disemboweling Mari while ranting about how he is \\"The Auteur\\". Steven then cuts a restrained Bruce in half with a chainsaw, which is shown through a television in the break room. Since the telephones and vehicles all fail to work, the remaining employees decide to make a run for it, after they look for the missing Mike. During the search, Klasu is taken after drinking drugged liquor. In the previously sealed attic the rest of the group find a Moviola showing Skeleton Crew itself, everything up until that very moment. As everyone theorizes that it is like reality itself has become blurred and they are inside a horror film, the machinery shows Klasu in a pit with Mike. Steven throws two spiked clubs into the hole, and has Klasu and Mike fight for their freedom. The former wins, but Steven goes back on his word, and burns Klasu to death with spotlights. The next to die is Erno, who is locked in the attic and bombarded with sound, causing a fatal aneurysm. While he, Lisa, and Anna are looking for another way out due to the main doors being sealed, Darius is captured, strung up, and impaled by a spear attached to a camera set on a dolly. Steven then takes Anna, severs her right arm and left leg, and leaves her for Lisa to find. Anna begs for death, and Lisa comes close to mercy killing her, but upon realizing that this scenario is almost an exact recreation of the opening of Silent Creek, fakes passing out. When an angered Steven approaches her, Lisa shoots him several times with a dead crew member's gun. Steven survives being shot, and upon realizing he cannot be killed due to the supernatural presence in the asylum, Lisa shoots herself in the mouth to spite Steve and ruin his film. However, Lisa survives the suicide attempt, and wakes up tied to chair, with Steven about to torture her with a blowtorch. In a post-credits scene, Steven is shown watching Skeleton Crew in a theatre. A viewer yells out \\"Ah, mate, that really sucked. Weren't even any fucking tits!\\"  Cast   Release  Lightning Media released Skeleton Crew on DVD 21 July 2009.  Reception  David Johnon of DVD Verdict wrote that it was well put together and \\"different and cool\\".

It was first named by Gerald R. Allen in 2004, and is commonly known as the Kimberley archerfish, largescale archerfish, or western archerfish.Common names for Toxotes kimberleyensis at www.fishbase.org.  Taxonomy  Archerfish are distributed throughout the waters of Australia and Indonesia, including a population in western Australia historically identified as Toxotes oligolepis. In 1978, in his Review of the Archerfishes, Gerald R. Allen suggested that \\"there is a possibility that [this population] may represent a distinct species\\". A direct comparison with the type material of T. oligolepis in 2001 revealed the Kimberley specimens differed in several ways, including having a deeper body and shorter dorsal fin spines. The specific name kimberleyensis refers to the Kimberley region of western Australia, where the species is localized.  Description  T. kimberleyensis can be identified from its fins, with five spines and 11‚Äì13 soft rays on the dorsal fin, three spines and 14‚Äì16 rays on the anal fin, and 12‚Äì13 pectoral rays. There are between 28 and 33 scales on the lateral line, which is nearly unbroken except at the pectoral fin. The pelvic fins are short. There are six to seven gill rakers on the lower limb of the first branchial arch. T. kimberleyensis can reach up to about in length, has a large mouth opening at an angle and fine villiform teeth. The head and body are smooth with very fine scales, but the scales are toothed as is common for perciform fish. T. kimberleyensis is silvery or silvery-white in color, with black side markings. The sides of the body are marked with four to five black bars which may be wedge-shaped or rounded. In young specimens, the fins are translucent or transparent, but adults have grey or black fins. = Differences from T. oligolepis = Toxotes oligolepis and Toxotes kimberleyensis have a similar colour pattern.Dianne J. Bray, 2011, Kimberley Archerfish, Toxotes kimberleyensis, in Fishes of Australia, accessed 18 May 2016. Nonetheless, T. kimberleyensis differs from T. oligolepis in several notable respects. The type specimen of T. oligolepis was thought to have been collected near Buru. T. oligolepis has longer dorsal spines overall than those observed in the Kimberley region population. The third dorsal spine of T. oligolepis is distinctive and extends higher than the rest of the soft dorsal fin, whereas the fourth and fifth spines of T. kimberleyensis are longest. However, the spines of T. kimberleyensis do not extend beyond the height of the soft portion of the dorsal fin. T. oligolepis also has around 25 scales on its lateral line, compared to 30‚Äì31 typically (and up to 33) for T. kimberleyensis.  Distribution and habitat  Toxotes kimberleyensis is restricted to inland fresh water habitats such as rivers. The known range of T. kimberleyensis is limited to the western Kimberley district of Australia, based on surveys conducted over three decades. It is common in the Fitzroy River, but has also been observed in the Isdell River, the Meda River, and the May River, where it is nonetheless rarer. Its relatives, the seven-spot archerfish (T. chatareus) and the banded archerfish (T. jaculatrix) can be found on the coast in brackish water or even saltwater, but T. kimberleyensis only inhabits freshwater environments. However, T. kimberleyensis can be found as much as upstream in the Fitzroy River and has been observed as far upstream as the Geikie Gorge National Park. T. kimberleyensis prefers deep freshwater pools but swims near the surface and near the shore. Like all archerfish, it feeds by shooting a jet of water from its mouth, knocking insects on overhanging vegetation near the shore into the water.

Life Epitome doctrinae de primo motu, Leipzig 1564 Victorinus Strigel was born 1524 in Kaufbeuren the son of the physician Ivo Strigel. He attended the University of Freiburg in October 1542 and went to the University of Wittenberg to study philosophy and theology. There he became a follower of Philipp Melanchthon in 1544, earned a Master of Arts, and gave his own lectures. Due to the Schmalkaldic War, he fled with Melanchthon at first to Magdeburg and went to the University of Erfurt, where he also taught. From Erfurt, he was recommended to Jena, where he took part in the founding of the Gymnasium‚Äôs academicum and from 20 March gave lectures on philosophy, history, and later on Melanchthon's Loci Communes. He then continued his academic career as a professor and rector of the University of Jena. He supported the establishment of the university constitution. Strigel taught students in Jena in the abandoned Dominican monastery; this was the setting of the emergence of the \\"Collegium Jenense.\\" With the appointment of Matthias Flacius 1557 Strigel entered into the dispute between the Gnesio-Lutherans and the Philippists, who tended toward the more mediating position of the followers of Melanchthon. In 1559 he was even taken into custody because of his theological views and suspended from duty. In 1562 he moved to the University of Leipzig to take a post, from there to Wittenberg, and finally to the University of Heidelberg in 1567, where he accepted the Reformed teaching of the Eucharist.

Meteorological history In early June 1989, a tropical wave emerged from the west coast of Africa and traversed the Atlantic Ocean, eventually crossing into the eastern North Pacific. Initially, several centers of circulation were associated with the system. Continuing organize, the storm is estimated to have attained tropical depression status at 0000 UTC on June 18. The depression was broad and lacked substantial thunderstorm activity. However, it did have respectable outflow and banding. It moved towards the west and intensified into a tropical storm at 0000 UTC on June 20, 48 hours after being classified. Upon being named, Cosme meandered and remained nearly stationary as it continued to intensify. It became a hurricane midday UTC on June 21; this upgrade was delayed in real time. At this time, the hurricane accelerated towards the north. As the cyclone approached the coast of Mexico, it reached maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 979 millibars. During the night of June 21, Cosme made landfall just east of Acapulco. It moved inland and quickly deteriorated, weakening into a tropical storm shortly after coming ashore. It trekked northward through eastern Mexico and further diminished into a tropical depression before becoming indistinguishable south of Brownsville, Texas on June 23. Tropical Storm Allison's development in the Gulf of Mexico was partially related to residual conditions from Cosme's remnants. Preparations and impact Rainfall map of Cosme Prior to the hurricane's landfall, Mexican officials evacuated nearly 260 people from low-lying areas near Acapulco. Ports in the region were also closed several days before the storm and remained closed for two days after as a precaution. In addition, flash flood watches and warnings were issued. Cosme brought heavy rains, which killed at least 30 people due to drowning. Many adobe homes were destroyed, but the specific cost of damage is unknown. The highest rainfall recorded in relation to Cosme was in San Bartolo Yautepec, Mexico. Many mountainous areas received rainfall in excess of and most other areas received . High winds produced by the storm damaged numerous trees and power lines throughout the affected areas. Authorities in Acapulco stated that there were no major damage or injuries from the storm, with only one hotel sustaining minor damage.

It came together in 2006 and consists of Mark Hunstone on guitar and vocals, James Montgomery on bass and vocals, and Adam Bowler on drums and vocals. Joe Pryor played drums for the band from 2006-08. Upon Pryor's move to New York in 2008, Nick Giles became the drummer. Keyboard player Pete Thomas joined the band between mid-2010 and mid-2011. Drummer Nick Giles left in late 2014 and was replaced by Adam Bowler, who had previously played for Positive Feedback Loop. They have been described as \\"something very Ferry on the Mersey\\", or Beatlesque. Mention of Paul Weller (does) not quite nail the sound but there is an undertone of that British invasion rock and roll that was big in the sixties\\" and \\"entertaining, danceable, listenable as well as easy on the eye\\". The SixtyOne.com commented, \\"have been waiting for this sound for a while now and the feldons deliver.\\" BMA Magazine wrote of the band, \\"it would appear that these guys have been brought up on a diet of late 60s British pop, mid 70s American blues, yet at times, with a peculiar mid-90s Britpop feel. One could even think at times that they are a decade, if not three, out of time. Think Supergrass meets the Libertines meets the Beatles meet Dire Straits and you'd be wrong, but close. Worth a listen.\\" BMA also commented on their latest record, Goody Hallett and Other Stories that it is [a] \\"solid album with some definite single-worthy tracks\\", and that it \\"wouldn't have sounded out of place in a groovy record shop in swinging London.\\" Of their third album Human Graffiti BMA magazine commented that the album \\"sees the folk influences of the Goody Hallett and Other Stories album left behind for a more poppy, up-tempo collection of songs,\\" and that the album \\"is full of catchy, bright foot tappers.\\" A fourth full-length album Paintbox was released online in late 2017. Triple J Unearthed commented that \\"There's a definite[sic] 60s pop sensibility with the harmonized vocals coming in and out and the semi-psychedelic fadeout(s) at the end. The guitar hooks (are) very catchy indeed and complements the vocals perfectly\\" and \\"classic rock rhythm/beat that makes you move like a tool around your kitchen and sing into your cooking utensils\\". Renowned and respected Australian guitarist and songwriter Tony Jaggers said of the band's latest (August 2012) release See the Sun, \\"if this had come out as a Beatles song then it would be one of their best. Its (sic) a standout tune amongst today's dross and it would be a crime if it doesn't get recognition.\\" Hunstone and Montgomery write all the band's material with obvious influences from 1960s British pop/ rock, mod, 1970s American electric blues. The Feldons have released three albums, A Cabinet of Human Oddities in 2008, Goody Hallett and Other Stories in 2012 and Human Graffiti in November 2014. The band has shared the bill with acts such as Angry Anderson, the Marji Curran Trio, Julia and the Deep Sea Sirens, Daniel Champagne, Bruce Callaway (The Saints), Phil Hall (Lime Spiders), Richard in your Mind, award-winning blues vocalist Jonno Zilber, James Southwell, Harry Brus (Australian Crawl, Kevin Borich, Ren√©e Geyer) as well as known Canberra acts such as the Crossbones, Slow Turismo and Space Party. The Feldons have also recorded with traditional cymbalom player Tim Meyen from Triplicate during the MITACT 2620 sessions. The band has also played the prestigious Summer Rhythm Festival in Canberra. In September 2012 the band teamed up with Austography Productions to film \\"See the Sun\\" taken from the Goody Hallett album. The band took their name from Get Smart actress Barbara Feldon quoting that \\"She is one of the hottest chicks to ever grace a television set.\\" In April 2018 Montgomery released a solo album Paper Walls under the name James Montgomery-Willcox. James Montgomery is the older brother of British based composer and conductor Jessica Cottis and is a published author, writing under the name of JG Montgomery.

Ride & Go Seek is an interactive dark ride attraction at Tokyo Disneyland. It is based on the 2001 Disney¬∑Pixar film Monsters, Inc. The attraction can be found at the entrance of Tomorrowland under the guise of the Monsters, Inc. scare factory from the film. Taking place long after the events of the film, the factory's new slogan has been changed from \\"We Scare Because We Care\\" to \\"It's Laughter We're After.\\" Various posters posted along the exterior of the factory inform guests about \\"Flashlight Tag,\\" an upcoming activity that's fun for the whole family. Story Once inside the factory, an instructional video is presented to guests on the premise of flashlight tag, narrated by Mike Wazowski. After learning how to play, guests are sent into security vehicles that have been equipped with individual flashlights. Once they have boarded, the vehicles take off and enter the inner sanctums of the factory. Ride Sulley has brought Boo back to Monstropolis in hopes that she will join in the flashlight festivities. Although it seems as if Boo is interested, she giggles naughtily, intending to go exploring rather than playing. Sulley warns her not to go off too far, but Boo simply responds by giggling. Turning a corner, guests find that Randall Boggs has returned from the human world(Great!), determined to capture Boo to extract her screams, by the usage of a butterfly net. Randall's evil laugh still echoes through the factory, the vehicles turn and face a window overlooking all of Monstropolis at nightfall. Mike stands nearby at the switch of a power generator, that supposedly gives power to all of Monstropolis. Mike kicks the flashlight tag off by turning off the generator, causing the entire factory and the city to go dark. Entering the boy's locker room, the flashlights turn on, allowing guests to point them at various objects, activating different characters and objects to come to life. Several tiny monsters pop out of the lockers, while other objects simply pop out from underneath floor tiles and benches. Turning into the bathroom, Sulley can be seen searching for Boo with his flashlight, Boo's giggling is heard from an unseen location. Randall can be found here hiding from Sulley whom he stands right behind. Pulling into the laugh floor, guests find several of M.I.'s top comedians joining in on the game, Sulley is found searching for Boo underneath tables. Mike can be found stuck in a jam between a hanging door and the arms of Smitty, trying to pull him back, while Needleman fiddles with the control panel. Leaving the laugh floor behind, guests pass Randall again whom the guests find hides behind a door, followed by a large crocodilian monster grasping a flashlight and laughing. Leaving the factory and entering the streets of Monstropolis, various monsters (including Ted, the monster that crowed like a chicken in the film. For the first time, Ted's whole body can be seen instead of just his legs.) can be found searching the streets with flashlights, many hiding in objects such as mail boxes and television sets. Boo is seen standing in the center of a dark alley, Randall mysteriously appears behind her with a net. However, Sulley pops out from a manhole beneath Boo, hoisting her into the air. Entering Harryhausen's sushi restaurant, guests find the octopus-like chef searching for Boo who can be found popping in and out of several different take-out boxes. Several odd fish can be found throughout the store, which also react to the flashlights. Preparing to leave the restaurant, Mike can be found with his girlfriend Celia, allowing guests to dunk her in water by using their flashlights to activate her tank. She falls in the water, and the vehicles head back into the streets. After tagging several more monsters, Mike can be found being electrocuted by a large power source continuously, the veins in his eye is illuminating with each shock. Sulley appears up ahead, worried that he has lost Boo again. He calls her name out in fright, but she is nowhere in sight. Entering the factory again, guests find Boo playing with some garbage outside of a garbage compactor, unaware that Randall is directly behind her, raising his butterfly net. Randall mutters to himself about his success, and when the power is suddenly returned to the factory, Mike emerges from a grate in the floor, knocking Randall backwards and sending him screaming into the garbage compactorÔºàAaarrgh!Ôºâ which, as guests watch on, sends him on a conveyor belt, only to be run over by a spike-lined wheel, repeatedly getting his body pummeled by large iron poles, flattened and spun across another large wheel while changing skin colors, then, chopped up by a large wall-like contraption, and emerge from the compactor in the shape of a cube, much like several other compacted cubes of garbage around him. Randall's eyes spin in circles a la Looney Tunes as he groans in pain. Turning away from the garbage compactor, Mike, Sulley, and Boo can be found outside of Boo's door, saying goodbye. Leaving them behind, the vehicles pass a small monster that waves goodbye, Boo beneath him, also saying goodbye. Turning yet another corner, guests pass an interactive audio animatronic Roz who resides in a filing room. Roz interacts with guests much as she does on Monsters, Inc. Mike & Sulley to the Rescue!. The vehicles rid of their riders and empty them out into the Monsters, Inc. Company Store where they can also look at their photos that were taken during the ride but cannot be purchased.

The group released three albums and charted three singles between 1980 and 1984. The American progressive rock group, Glass Moon was formed in the early 1970s by guitarist John Wheliss, with lead vocalist Rodney Barbour on guitar and flute, and Nestor Nunez on bass and vocals. Drummer Chris Jones joined in 1972; David Adams, on vocals and keyboards, in 1974. The band toured the east coast until 1977 when they temporarily disbanded; then reformed as a trio, with Adams as lead vocalist, and Nunez and Jones in 1978. Sideman guitarist Jamie Glaser filled Wheliss' place as guitarist on the group's recording sessions for their first two albums and performed live with the group in 1981, while not officially being a member of Glass Moon.  Career  In 1980 Glass Moon were the first act signed to Electric Lady Productions, the company formed by Alan Selby, owner of the Electric Lady Studios in New York City, with Glass Moon, the band's debut album, recorded at Electric Lady Studios and released by the independent label Radio Records with distribution through RCA Records. Despite the lead single \\"(I Like) The Way You Play\\" stalling in the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart in Billboard at #108, the success of the Glass Moon album; which reached #148 on the Billboard album chart; was sufficient for Radio Records to have Glass Moon record a second album at Electric Lady Studios in 1981. Release of this second album, Growing in the Dark, was delayed until February 1982, after Radio Records had secured a distribution deal with Atlantic Records. Nunez and Jones departed the band soon after the album was completed. Although Glass Moon did not have supporting members at this time, the Growing in the Dark album yielded a Billboard Hot 100 single with a remake of the Hollies' \\"On a Carousel\\" which peaked at #50 in April 1982. Even though the single had only modest chart performance, Dave Adams would later state: \\"Needless to say, I made a good living off that song for fourteen years\\", while praising Atlantic Records, who had eventually agreed to distribute the Growing in the Dark album, with \\"On a Carousel\\" as its lead single: \\"The stellar Atlantic promotion team certainly made all the difference in making 'On a Carousel' the hit it became.\\" In 1984, Dave Adams reformed Glassmoon, with the group's name adjusted to one word, with drummer Doug Morgan, (formerly of 3PM); guitarist Rod Abernethy, (billed while with Glassmoon as Rod Dash), and Bob Patterson on bass.Wilmington Morning Star Vol 117 #238 (18 July 1984) p. 1C Abernethy and Patterson had appeared in the three 1982 videos prepared to promote the album Growing in the Dark, in the absence of departed Glass Moon members. (Abernethy had appeared in all three videos including the first which was for \\"On a Carousel\\": Patterson only appeared in the second and third videos which were for the album tracks \\"Simon\\" and \\"Telegram Song\\".) In January and February 1984 Glassmoon recorded the album Sympathetic Vibration at the Bath, Somerset studio of producer David Lord. Adams co-produced the album which was released by MCA Records (with whom Glassmoon had a two album deal), in June 1984, by which time Abernethy had left the group. With Dick Smith as guitarist, Glassmoon toured into 1986. The Sympathetic Vibration single \\"Cold Kid\\" having stalled at #103 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, MCA cancelled the second album and the group soon afterwards disbanded permanently. Dave Adams would record the solo album Dancing in My Sleep in 1986, and would subsequently front a band named Suicide Blonde based in the Raleigh area.

The translated quotation is from Simon Coupland (1998), \\"From Poachers to Gamekeepers: Scandinavian Warlords and Carolingian Kings\\", Early Medieval Europe, 7(1): 87 and note 11. He was probably a son of Halfdan, a leading Dane who became a vassal of Charlemagne in 807. He was probably related to the Danish royal family, as \\"Hemming\\" was one of their favoured names. The onomastic evidence includes the Danish king Hemming I (reigned 810‚Äì12) and then a Hemming II, who was recalled to Denmark from Francia by his brothers Harald Klak and Reginfrid after Hemming I's death. This Hemming was probably the same person as Hemming Halfdansson. He probably soon returned to Francia, since there is no evidence of him in Danish politics after he and his brothers were driven out by the sons of Godfrid in 813.Coupland, 87‚Äì88. It is probable that Hemming was received by the Franks and granted Walcheren, a fortress in Frisia, as a benefice. It may have been held earlier by his father, it was certainly granted in 841 to the Danes Harald and Rorik. He, along with its Frankish count, Eccihard, died defending it from a Viking attack in 837.There are references to their deaths in the Annales Fuldenses, Annales Bertiniani and in Thegan, cf. Coupland, 88. Probably both Eccihard and Hemming were responsible for the defence of Frisia from the Vikings, as a capitulary of 821 refers to \\"the counts who are responsible for coastal defence\\". If so, Hemming appears to have been the superior, since Thegan of Trier in his Gesta Hludowici imperatoris, an account of the reign of Louis the Pious, names him first when recording the dead, followed by \\"another leader, Eccihard, and many of the emperor's nobles\\".‚ÄúEccihardus alius dux et multi optimates imperatoris‚Äù, quoted in Coupland, 88 and note 17.

According to popular belief, Cleopatra committed suicide by allowing an asp (Egyptian cobra) to bite her, but for Greek and Roman historians, Cleopatra poisoned herself using either a toxic ointment or sharp implement such as a hairpin. Primary source accounts are derived mainly from the works of the ancient Roman historians Strabo, Plutarch, and Cassius Dio. Modern scholars debate the validity of ancient reports involving snakebites as the cause of death and if she was murdered or not. Some academics hypothesize that her Roman political rival Octavian forced her to commit suicide in the manner of her choosing. The location of Cleopatra's tomb is unknown. It was recorded that Octavian allowed for her and her husband, the Roman politician and general Mark Antony, who stabbed himself with a sword, to be buried together properly. Cleopatra's death effectively ended the final war of the Roman Republic between triumvirs Octavian and Antony, in which Cleopatra aligned herself with Antony, father to three of her children. Antony and Cleopatra fled to Egypt following their loss at the 31 BC Battle of Actium in Roman Greece, after which Octavian invaded Egypt and defeated their forces. Committing suicide allowed her to avoid the humiliation of being paraded as a prisoner in a Roman triumph celebrating the military victories of Octavian, who would become Rome's first emperor in 27 BC and be known as Augustus. Octavian had Cleopatra's son Caesarion (also known as Ptolemy XV), rival heir of Julius Caesar, killed in Egypt but spared her children with Antony and brought them to Rome. Cleopatra's death marked the end of the Hellenistic period and Ptolemaic rule of Egypt, as well as the beginning of Roman Egypt, which became a province of the Roman Empire. notes that the Hellenistic period, beginning with the reign of Alexander the Great (336‚Äì323 BC), came to an end with the death of Cleopatra in 30 BC. Michael Grant stresses that the Hellenistic Greeks were viewed by contemporary Romans as having declined and diminished in greatness since the age of Classical Greece, an attitude that has continued even into the works of modern historiography. In regards to Hellenistic Egypt, Grant argues that \\"Cleopatra VII, looking back upon all that her ancestors had done during that time, was not likely to make the same mistake. But she and her contemporaries of the first century BC had another, peculiar, problem of their own. Could the 'Hellenistic Age' (which we ourselves often regard as coming to an end in about her time) still be said to exist at all, could any Greek age, now that the Romans were the dominant power? This was a question never far from Cleopatra's mind. But it is quite certain that she considered the Greek epoch to be by no means finished, and intended to do everything in her power to ensure its perpetuation.\\" The death of Cleopatra has been depicted in various works of art throughout history. These include the visual, literary, and performance arts, ranging from sculptures and paintings to poetry and plays, as well as modern films. Cleopatra featured prominently in the prose and poetry of ancient Latin literature. While surviving ancient Roman depictions of her death in visual arts are rare, Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, and Modern works are numerous. Ancient Greco-Roman sculptures such as the Esquiline Venus and Sleeping Ariadne served as inspirations for later artworks portraying her death, universally involving the snakebite of an asp. Cleopatra's death has evoked themes of eroticism and sexuality, in works that include paintings, plays, and films, especially from the Victorian era. Modern works depicting Cleopatra's death include Neoclassical sculpture, Orientalist painting, and cinema. Prelude Cleopatra and Mark Antony on the obverse and reverse, respectively, of a silver tetradrachm struck at the Antioch mint in 36 BC Following the First Triumvirate and assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC, the Roman statesmen Octavian, Mark Antony, and Aemilius Lepidus were elected as triumvirs to bring Caesar's assassins to justice, forming the Second Triumvirate. With Lepidus marginalized in Africa and eventually placed under house arrest by Octavian, the two remaining triumvirs divided control over the Roman world between the Greek East and Latin West, Antony taking the former and Octavian the latter. Cleopatra VII of Ptolemaic Egypt, a pharaoh of Macedonian Greek descent who ruled from Alexandria, had an extramarital affair with Julius Caesar that produced a son and eventual Ptolemaic co-ruler Caesarion. After Caesar's death she developed a relationship with Antony. With encouragement from Cleopatra, Antony officially divorced Octavian's sister Octavia Minor in 32 BC. It is likely he had already married Cleopatra during the Donations of Alexandria in 34 BC. says that it is unclear if Antony and Cleopatra were ever truly married. says that the marriage publicly sealed Antony's alliance with Cleopatra and in defiance of Octavian he would divorce Octavia in 32 BC. Coins of Antony and Cleopatra depict them in the typical manner of a Hellenistic royal couple, as explained by . Antony's divorce from Octavia, Octavian's public revelation of Antony's will outlining Cleopatra's ambitions for Roman territory in the Donations of Alexandria and her continued illegal military support for a Roman citizen currently without an elected office convinced the Roman Senate, now under Octavian's control, to declare war on Cleopatra. Following their defeat in the naval Battle of Actium at the Ambracian Gulf of Greece in 31 BC, Cleopatra and Antony retreated back to Egypt to recuperate and prepare for an assault by Octavian, whose forces grew larger with the surrender of many of Antony's officers and soldiers in Greece.For further validation, see and . After a long period of failed negotiations, Octavian's forces invaded Egypt in the spring of 30 BC. While Octavian captured Pelousion near the eastern borders of Ptolemaic Egypt, his officer Cornelius Gallus marched from Cyrene and captured Paraitonion to the west. Although Antony was able to score a small victory over Octavian's tired troops as they approached Alexandria's hippodrome on 1 August, 30 BC, his naval fleet and cavalry defected to Octavian soon afterwards. Suicide of Antony and Cleopatra With Octavian's forces in Alexandria, Cleopatra withdrew to her tomb with her closest attendants and had a message sent to Antony that she had committed suicide. Antony ordered his slave Eros to murder him, but instead Eros turned his sword on himself and committed suicide. In despair, Antony stabbed himself through the stomach with a sword, dying at age 53. In Plutarch's telling, Antony was still alive as he was carried into Cleopatra's tomb, telling her in his dying words that he would die honorably and that she could trust a certain Gaius Proculeius on Octavian's side to treat her well. The same Proculeius used a ladder to breach a window of Cleopatra's tomb and detain her inside before she could have a chance to commit suicide or burn herself to death along with her vast treasure. Cleopatra was allowed to embalm Antony's body before she was forcefully escorted to the palace, where she eventually met with Octavian, who had also detained three of her children: Alexander Helios, Cleopatra Selene II, and Ptolemy Philadelphus. As related by Livy, in her meeting with Octavian, Cleopatra told him candidly, \\"I will not be led in a triumph\\" (), but Octavian only gave the cryptic answer that her life would be spared. He did not offer her any specific details about his plans for Egypt or her royal family. When a spy informed Cleopatra that Octavian intended to bring her back to Rome to be paraded as a prisoner in his Roman triumph, she decided to avoid this humiliation and took her own life at age 39, in August 30 BC.For further validation, see and . Plutarch elaborates how Cleopatra approached her suicide in an almost ritual process that involved bathing and then a fine meal including figs brought to her in a basket. Cleopatra and Octavian, a painting by Louis Gauffier, 1787 Plutarch writes that Octavian ordered his freedman Epaphroditus to guard her and prevent her from committing suicide. Nevertheless, Cleopatra was able to deceive him and kill herself. When Octavian received a note from Cleopatra requesting that she be buried next to Antony, he had his messengers rush to her. The servant broke down her door but was too late. Plutarch states that she was found with her handmaidens Iras, dying at her feet, and Charmion, adjusting Cleopatra's diadem before she herself fell.For primary source translations of Plutarch's account of the deaths of Charmion and Iras, see , , and . It is unclear from primary sources if their suicides took place within the palace or inside Cleopatra's tomb. Cassius Dio claims that Octavian called on trained snake charmers of the Psylli tribe of Ancient Libya to attempt an oral venom extraction and revival of Cleopatra, but their efforts failed. Although Octavian was outraged by these events and \\"was robbed of the full splendor of his victory\\" according to Cassius Dio, he had Cleopatra interred next to Antony in their tomb as requested, and also gave Iras and Charmion proper burials. Date of death hemiobol coin of Cleopatra VII struck in 31 BC (the year she and Mark Antony lost the Battle of Actium), showing her wearing the royal diadem There are no surviving records dating Cleopatra's death. Theodore Cressy Skeat deduced that she died on 12 August, 30 BC, on the basis of contemporary records of fixed events along with cross examination of historical sources. His supposition is supported by Stanley M. Burstein, James Grout, and Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton, although the latter are more cautious by qualifying it was circa 12 August. An alternative date of 10 August, 30 BC, is supported by scholars such as Duane W. Roller, Joann Fletcher, and Jaynie Anderson. Cause of death A steel engraving depicting Caesar Augustus' now lost painting of Cleopatra VII in encaustic, which was discovered at Emperor Hadrian's Villa (near Tivoli, Italy) in 1818; she is seen here wearing the golden radiant crown of the Ptolemaic rulers, and an Isis knot (corresponding to Plutarch's description of her wearing the robes of Isis). Cleopatra's personal physician Olympos, cited by Plutarch, mentioned neither a cause of death nor an asp bite or Egyptian cobra.Historian Duane W. Roller, in , provides a thorough explanation of the various claims about Cleopatra's cause of death in Roman historiography and primary sources. He states unequivocally that Olympos did not describe any cause of death, only that Plutarch discussed the cause of death only after he was finished relaying the report by Olympos, introducing the tale of the asp bite in such a way that he expected his readers to have already had foreknowledge about it. Strabo, who provides the earliest known historical account, believed that Cleopatra committed suicide either by asp bite or poisonous ointment.For further validation, see . Plutarch mentions the tale of the asp brought to her in a basket of figs, although he offers other alternatives for her cause of death, such as use of a hollow implement (), perhaps a hairpin, which she used to scratch open the skin and introduce the toxin. According to Cassius Dio small puncture wounds were found on Cleopatra's arm, but he echoed the claim by Plutarch that nobody knew the true cause of her death. Dio mentioned the claim of the asp and even suggested use of a needle (), possibly from a hairpin, which would seem to corroborate Plutarch's account. Other contemporary historians such as Florus and Velleius Paterculus supported the asp bite version. Roman physician Galen mentioned the asp story, but he advances a version where Cleopatra bit her arm and introduced venom brought in a container. Suetonius relayed the story of the asp but expressed doubt about its validity. The cause of Cleopatra's death was rarely mentioned and debated in early modern scholarship. The encyclopedic writer Thomas Browne, in his 1646 Pseudodoxia Epidemica, explained that it was uncertain how Cleopatra had died and that artistic depictions of small snakes biting her failed to accurately show the larger size of the land asp. In 1717 the anatomist Giovanni Battista Morgagni maintained a brief, recreational literary correspondence with the papal physician Giovanni Maria Lancisi about the queen's cause of death, as referenced in Morgagni's 1761 De Sedibus and published as a series of epistles in his 1764 Opera omnia. Morgagni argued that Cleopatra was likely killed by a snakebite and contested Lancisi's suggestion that consumption of venom was more plausible, noting that no ancient Greco-Roman authors had mentioned her drinking it. Lancisi rebutted by arguing that accounts offered by Roman poets were unreliable since they often exaggerated events. In his literary memoirs published in 1777, the physician Jean Goulin supported Morgagni's argument of the snakebite being the most probable cause of death. Cleopatra, by Benedetto Gennari, 1674‚Äì1675 Modern scholars have also cast doubt on the story of the venomous snakebite as the cause of death. Roller notes the prominence of snakes in Egyptian mythology while also asserting that no surviving historical account discusses the difficulty of smuggling a large Egyptian cobra into Cleopatra's chambers and then having it behave as intended. Roller also claims the venom is only fatal if injected into a vital area of the body. Egyptologist Wilhelm Spiegelberg (1870‚Äì1930) argued that Cleopatra's choice of suicide by asp bite was one that befitted her royal status, the asp representing the uraeus, sacred serpent of the ancient Egyptian sun god Ra. Robert A. Gurval, Associate Professor of Classics at UCLA, points out that the Athenian strategos Demetrios of Phaleron (c. 350 ‚Äì c. 280 BC), confined by Ptolemy II Philadelphus in Egypt, committed suicide by asp bite in a \\"curiously similar\\" manner, one that also demonstrated that it was not exclusive to Egyptian royalty.For further validation that Demetrios of Phaleron, adviser to Ptolemy I Soter, died from an asp bite, see . Gurval notes that the bite of an Egyptian cobra contains around 175‚Äì300 mg of neurotoxin, lethal to humans with only 15‚Äì20 mg, although death would not have been immediate as victims usually stay alive for several hours. Fran√ßois Pieter Retief, retired lecturer and dean of medicine at the University of the Free State, and Louise Cilliers, honorary research fellow at their Department of Greek, Latin and Classical Studies, argue that a large snake would not have fit into a basket of figs and it was more likely that poisoning would have so rapidly killed the three adult women, Cleopatra and her handmaidens Charmion and Iras. Noting the example of Cleopatra's hairpin, Cilliers and Retief also highlight how other ancient figures poisoned themselves in similar ways, including Demosthenes, Hannibal, and Mithridates VI of Pontus. According to Gregory Tsoucalas, lecturer in the history of medicine at the Democritus University of Thrace, and Markos Sgantzos, Associate Professor of Anatomy at the University of Thessaly, evidence suggests that Octavian ordered the poisoning of Cleopatra. In Murder of Cleopatra, the criminal profiler Pat Brown argues that Cleopatra was murdered and the details of it were covered up by Roman authorities. Claims that she was murdered contradict the majority of primary sources that report her cause of death as suicide. Historian Patricia Southern speculates that Octavian could have possibly allowed Cleopatra to choose the manner of her death instead of executing her. Grout writes that Octavian may have wanted to avoid the sort of sympathy espoused for Cleopatra's younger sister Arsinoe IV when she was paraded in chains but spared during Julius Caesar's triumph. Octavian perhaps permitted Cleopatra to die by her own hand after considering the political issues that could have risen from the murder of a queen whose statue had been erected in the Temple of Venus Genetrix by his adoptive father Caesar. Aftermath During her final days, Cleopatra had Caesarion sent away to Upper Egypt and perhaps planned for him to eventually flee to Nubia, Ethiopia, or India in exile. Caesarion reigned as Ptolemy XV for only eighteen days, when he was captured and executed on Octavian's orders on 29 August, 30 BC. This was done following the advice of the Alexandrian Greek philosopher Arius Didymus, who cautioned that two rival heirs to Julius Caesar could not share the world together. The deaths of Cleopatra and Caesarion marked the end of both the Ptolemaic dynasty's rule of Egypt and the Hellenistic period, which had lasted since the reign of Alexander the Great (r. 336‚Äì323 BC). Egypt became a province of the newly established Roman Empire, with Octavian renamed in 27 BC as Augustus, the first Roman emperor,For further validation, see . ruling with the facade of a Roman Republic. Roller affirms that Caesarion's alleged reign was \\"essentially a fiction\\" invented by chroniclers of Egypt, such as Clement of Alexandria in his Stromata, to explain the gap between Cleopatra's death and the induction of Egypt as a Roman province directly ruled by Octavian as pharaoh of Egypt.For further information, see . Plutarch, translated by , wrote in vague terms that \\"Octavian had Caesarion killed later, after Cleopatra's death.\\" Contrary to regular Roman provinces, Octavian established Egypt as territory under his personal control, barring the Roman Senate from intervening in any of its affairs and appointing his own equestrian governors of Egypt, the first of whom was Cornelius Gallus. For further information, see and . Antony's three children with Cleopatra were spared and sent to Rome; their daughter Cleopatra Selene II eventually married Juba II of Mauretania. Tomb of Antony and Cleopatra The site of the mausoleum of Cleopatra and Mark Antony is uncertain. The Egyptian Antiquities Service believes that it is in or near a temple of Taposiris Magna, southwest of Alexandria. In their excavations of the temple of Osiris at Taposiris Magna, archaeologists Kathleen Martinez and Zahi Hawass have discovered six burial chambers and their artifacts, including forty coins minted by Cleopatra and Antony as well as an alabaster bust depicting Cleopatra. An alabaster mask with a cleft chin discovered at the site bears a resemblance to ancient portraits of Mark Antony. In an early 1st century AD painting from the House of Giuseppe II in Pompeii, a rear wall depicted with a set of double doors positioned very high above the scene of a woman wearing a royal diadem and committing suicide among her attendants suggests the described layout of Cleopatra's tomb in Alexandria. Depictions in art and literature =Hellenistic and Roman eras= Cleopatra committing suicide, fresco from the House of Giuseppe II, Pompeii, 1st century AD In his triumphant procession at Rome in 39 BC, Octavian paraded Cleopatra's children Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II, but he also presented an effigy to the crowd depicting Cleopatra with an asp clinging to her. This was likely the same painting discovered in emperor Hadrian's Villa in 1818, now lost but described in an archaeological report and depicted in a steel engraving by John Sartain. The poet Propertius, an eyewitness of Octavian's triumph along the Via Sacra, noted that the paraded image of Cleopatra contained multiple snakes biting each of her arms. Citing Plutarch, Giuseppe Pucci indicates that the effigy may have even been a statue. In his \\"Notes isiaques I\\" (1989), French Archaeologist Jean-Claude Grenier observed that an ancient Roman statue of a woman wearing a knot of Isis in the Vatican Museums portrays a snake crawling up her right breast, perhaps a depiction of Cleopatra's suicide while dressed as the Egyptian goddess Isis. Cleopatra's association with Isis continued in Egypt after her death, at least until 373 AD, when the Egyptian scribe Petesenufe compiled a book of Isis and explained how he decorated images of Cleopatra with gold. A mid-1st century BC Roman wall painting from Pompeii most likely depicting Cleopatra with her infant son Caesarion was walled off by its owner around 30 BC, perhaps in reaction to Octavian's proscription against images depicting Caesarion, the rival heir of Julius Caesar. Although statues of Mark Antony were torn down, those of Cleopatra were generally spared this program of destruction, including the one erected by Caesar in the Temple of Venus Genetrix in the Forum of Caesar. An early 1st century AD painting from Pompeii most likely depicts the suicide of Cleopatra, accompanied by attendants and even her son Caesarion wearing a royal diadem like his mother, although an asp is absent from the scene, perhaps reflecting the different causes of death provided in Roman historiography.For further information about the painting in the House of Giuseppe II (i.e. Joseph II) at Pompeii and the possible identification of Cleopatra as one of the figures, see Some posthumous images of Cleopatra meant for common consumption were perhaps less flattering. A Roman terracotta lamp in the British Museum made circa 40‚Äì80 AD contains a relief depicting a nude woman with the queen's distinct hairstyle. In it she holds a palm branch, rides an Egyptian crocodile and sits on a large phallus in a Nilotic scene. The story of the asp was widely accepted among the Augustan-period Latin poets such as Horace and Virgil, in which two snakes were even suggested as biting Cleopatra. Although retaining the negative views of Cleopatra apparent in other pro-Augustan Roman literature, Horace depicted Cleopatra's suicide as a bold act of defiance and liberation. Virgil established the view of Cleopatra as a figure of epic melodrama and romance. =Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque periods= The story of Cleopatra's suicide by snakebite was often depicted in Medieval and Renaissance art. The artist known as the Boucicaut Master, in a 1409 AD miniature for an illuminated manuscript of Des cas de nobles hommes et femmes by 14th-century AD poet Giovanni Boccaccio, depicted Cleopatra and Antony lying together in a Gothic-style tomb, with a snake near Cleopatra's chest and a bloody sword driven through Antony's chest. Illustrated versions of Boccaccio's written works, including images of Cleopatra and Antony committing suicide, first appeared in France during the Quattrocento (i.e. 15th century AD), authored by Laurent de Premierfait. Woodcut illustrations of Boccaccio's De Mulieribus Claris published at Ulm in 1479 and Augsburg in 1541 depict Cleopatra's discovery of Antony's body after his suicide by stabbing. Like much of Medieval literature about Cleopatra, Boccaccio's writings are largely negative and misogynistic. The 14th-century poet Geoffrey Chaucer counters these depictions, offering a positive view of Cleopatra. Chaucer began his hagiography on virtuous pagan women with the life of Cleopatra, depicted in a satirical fashion as a queen engaged in courtly love with her knight Mark Antony. His depiction of her suicide included a pit of serpents rather than the Roman tale of the asps. Cleopatra, by Michelangelo, c. 1535 Free-standing nude depictions of Cleopatra poisoned by an asp became common during the Italian Renaissance. The 16th-century Venetian artist Giovanni Maria Padovano (i.e. Mosca) created two marble reliefs of the suicide of Antony and Cleopatra, as well as several free-standing nude statues of Cleopatra being bitten by the asp that were partly inspired by ancient Roman sculptures such as the Esquiline Venus.As outlined by , , , scholars debate whether or not the Esquiline Venus‚Äîdiscovered in 1874 on the Esquiline Hill in Rome and housed in the Palazzo dei Conservatori of the Capitoline Museums‚Äîis a depiction of Cleopatra, based on the hairstyle and facial features of the woman in the sculpture, her apparent royal diadem worn over the head, and the uraeus Egyptian cobra wrapped around a vase or column at the base. As explained by , the Esquiline Venus is generally thought to be a mid-1st century AD Roman copy of a 1st century BC Greek original from the school of Pasiteles. Bartolommeo Bandinelli created a drawing of Cleopatra as a free-standing nude committing suicide that served as the basis for a similar engraving by Agostino Veneziano. Another engraving by Veneziano and a drawing by Raphael depicting Cleopatra's suicide as she slumbered were inspired by the ancient Greco-Roman Sleeping Ariadne, which at the time was thought to depict Cleopatra. Works of the French Renaissance also depict Cleopatra slumbering while pressing a snake to her breast. Michelangelo created a black-chalk drawing of Cleopatra's suicide by asp bite around 1535. The 17th-century Baroque painter Guido Reni depicted Cleopatra's death by asp bite, albeit with a snake that is tiny compared to a real Egyptian cobra. The Sleeping Ariadne, acquired by Pope Julius II in 1512, inspired three poems of Renaissance literature eventually carved into the pilaster frame of the statue. The first of these was published by Baldassare Castiglione, which became widely circulated by 1530 and inspired the other two poems by Bernardino Baldi and Agostino Favoriti. Castiglione's poem depicted Cleopatra as a tragic but honorable ruler in a doomed love affair with Antony, a queen whose death freed her from the ignominy of Roman imprisonment. The Sleeping Ariadne was also commonly depicted in paintings, including those by Titian, Artemisia Gentileschi, and Edward Burne-Jones. These works tended to eroticize the moment of Cleopatra's death, while Victorian era artists found the unconscious, recumbent female form as an acceptable outlet for their eroticism. Cleopatra's death features in several works of the performing arts. In the 1607 play Devil's Charter by Barnabe Barnes, a snake handler brings two asps to Cleopatra and allows them to bite both her breasts in a racy manner. In William Shakespeare's 1609 play Antony and Cleopatra the snake represents both death as well as a lover who Cleopatra desires, yielding to his pinch. Shakespeare relied on Thomas North's 1579 translation of Plutarch for crafting his play, which can be viewed as both a comedy and a tragedy. The play involved use of multiple asps, as well as the character of Charmion who killed herself by asp bite after Cleopatra. =Modern era= In modern literature, Ted Hughes' poem \\"Cleopatra to the Asp\\" (1960) creates a monologue of Cleopatra speaking to the asp that is about to kill her. During the Victorian era, plays such as Cl√©op√¢tre (1890) by Victorien Sardou became popular, although audiences were generally shocked by the emotional intensity of stage actress Sarah Bernhardt's depiction of Cleopatra reacting to Antony's suicide. In opera, Samuel Barber's Antony and Cleopatra, first performed in 1966 and based on Shakespeare's play, Cleopatra recounts a dream that Antony, now dead before her, would become emperor of Rome. When Dollabella informs her that Caesar intends to march her in his triumph in Rome, she commits suicide with Charmion by asp bite, before being carried off to be buried with Antony. The Death of Cleopatra, by Edmonia Lewis, 1876 The character of Cleopatra had appeared in forty-three films by the end of the 20th century. Georges M√©li√®s' Robbing Cleopatra's Tomb (), an 1899 French silent horror film, was the first to depict the character of Cleopatra. Following the Italo-Turkish War (1911‚Äì1912), the 1913 Italian film Marcantonio e Cleopatra by Enrico Guazzoni depicted Cleopatra as the embodiment of the cruel Orient, a queen who had defied Rome, while the actions of her lover Antony, after his suicide, are forgiven by Octavian. In cultivating a stage persona for her character in the 1917 US film Cleopatra, actress Theda Bara was seen in public petting snakes while the Fox Film Corporation posed her in front of Cleopatra's alleged mummified remains in a museum, where she announced that she was the reincarnation of Cleopatra, having received hieroglyphic tributary offerings from a reincarnated servant. Fox Studios also had Bara dress as a leader of the occult and associated her with perverse death and sexuality. The 1963 Hollywood film Cleopatra by Joseph L. Mankiewicz contains a dramatic scene where the Egyptian queen, portrayed by Elizabeth Taylor, is engaged in a slap-fight with her lover Mark Antony, portrayed by Richard Burton, inside the tomb where they would be interred. In other modern visual arts, Cleopatra has been depicted in mediums such as paintings and sculptures. In her 1876 sculpture The Death of Cleopatra, African American artist Edmonia Lewis, despite championing the non-white female form in artworks, chose to depict Cleopatra with Caucasian features, perhaps in keeping with Cleopatra's recorded lineage as a Macedonian Greek. affirms that \\"to give Cleopatra a white complexion is quite correct, given her Macedonian descent. In literature, however, Cleopatra's racial features are more ambiguous.\\" For Cleopatra's European origins through her ancestor Ptolemy I Soter, a general of Alexander the Great from the kingdom of Macedonia in northern Greece, see and . Lewis' Neoclassical sculpture offers a post-mortem view of Cleopatra dressed in Egyptian regalia and sitting on her throne, which is decorated with two sphinx heads that represent the twins she bore with Mark Antony: Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II. An 1880 plaster sculpture of Cleopatra committing suicide, now found in Lille, France, was once thought to be a work by Albert Darcq, but restoration and cleaning of the sculpture revealed the signature of Charles Gauthier, to whom the work is now attributed. The 1874 painting Death of Cleopatra by Jean-Andr√© Rixens depicts a dead Cleopatra with very light skin, accompanied by maidservants with rather dark skin, a combination frequently found in modern artworks portraying the scene of Cleopatra's death. Orientalist paintings by Rixens and others influenced the hybrid Ancient-Egyptian and Middle-Eastern decor found in the J. Gordon Edwards' film Cleopatra starring Bara, seen standing on a Persian carpet but with Egyptian wall paintings in the background. =Paintings= File:Guido Cagnacci 003.jpgThe Death of Cleopatra by Guido Cagnacci, 1658 File:Death of Cleopatra by Rixens.jpgThe Death of Cleopatra by Jean-Andr√© Rixens, 1874 File:The Death of Cleopatra by Juan Luna1881.jpgThe Death of Cleopatra by Juan Luna, 1881 File:The Death of Cleopatra arthur.jpgThe Death of Cleopatra by Reginald Arthur, 1892 =Prints= File:Cleopatra, Jan Muller, after Adriaen de Vries, c.1598.jpgCleopatra, by Jan Muller, after Adriaen de Vries, c. 1598 File:The suicide of Cleopatra; the asp is wriggling up the left a Wellcome V0041560.jpgThe suicide of Cleopatra: the asp is wriggling up the left arm of the sleeping Cleopatra (after the Sleeping Ariadne), engraving by Jean-Baptiste de Poilly (1669‚Äì1728) File:Robert Strange - Cleopatra.jpgCleopatra, by Robert Strange (after Guido Reni), 1777 File:Anne seymour damer antony and cleopatra.JPGA 1788 engraving depicting the bas relief Antony and Cleopatra, sculpted by Anne Seymour Damer =Statues, busts and other sculptures= File:Esquiline Venus Musei Capitolini MC1141 n1.jpgThe Esquiline Venus, 1st century AD Roman copy of a late Hellenistic artwork from the 1st century BC, with a snake depicted on the vase at the base and a woman wearing a royal diadem.

A trained geographer, Martin was considered a world-renowned expert in the ivory trade and rhinoceros horn trade. He had been a special envoy of the United Nations for the conservation of rhinoceros. Militant for a reduction in the demand for ivory to dry up the market, he participated notably in the stop of rhinoceros horn trade to China in 1993 and ivory in 2017. Martin was found dead on 4 February 2018 with a stab wound to his neck in Nairobi, Kenya, aged 76. Life and career Esmond was born in New York City on April 17, 1941. He was the great-grandson of 19th century steel magnate Henry Phipps. Martin attended Brooks School, in North Andover, MA and graduated in 1959. He then earned a bachelor of science degree in geography from the University of Arizona in 1964, followed by a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Liverpool in 1970. In the mid-1970s, Martin and his wife, Chryssee Martin, settled in Nairobi, Kenya, and began studying and publishing books, researching a wide variety of historical and anthropological subjects. In 1979, Martin discovered his true calling: he was asked by the World Wildlife Fund and the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources if you could help them quantify the traffic in elephant ivory. His first investigation of the ivory trade appeared in December 1979. The rest of his career was dedicated to animal conservation research with an emphasis on ivory and rhino horn.  Ivory Trade Research  From the late 1970s until 2018, Martin traveled extensively took great risk to gather data surrounding the ivory trade. He would often go deep undercover, meticulously documenting and photographing illegal sales of ivory and rhino horn, all in secret to the surrounding merchants. Sharply dressed, Martin would hide in plain sight as an affluent shopper for illicit ivory and rhino horn, and went undercover to gain information about the illegal wildlife trade. Through this persona, he was able to gain intel surrounding the practices of these traders. Martin served as the United Nations special envoy for rhino conservation. In the 1990s he spent a year undercover posing as an ivory dealer, collecting data on how the price of ivory grew from $20 per kilogram that the poachers received, to almost $600 per kilogram in China at the end of the trade line. Between that is a dense line of middlemen earning major profits off of extinction. In the undercover process, Martin exposed an Italian diplomat (who smuggled ivory by hiding it in dog meat) and an Indonesian ambassador among other high ranking officials corruptly involved in the trade. An anecdotal achievement by Martin was debunking the myth that rhino horn was used by Asian buyers for sexual purposes, which is incorrect. Rather, it was primary used for traditional medicine such as lowering fever, making dagger handles in Yemen, and more recently, as a party drug when mixed with cocaine. While it is still a widespread myth that rhino horn has health benefits, the reality is that rhino horn is made of keratin, the same material of fingernails, and has no properties other than as a placebo effect or a symbol of buying power. Martin‚Äôs research primarily focused on curbing the demand of these products. He was instrumental in stopping the rhinoceros horn trade in China in 1993, and then the ivory trade in China in 2017. While other leaders were more tepid about making these items illegal, Martin stood for a total ban of wildlife products as the solution for saving these animals, despite their still drastically decreasing numbers. Other contributions Martin made to this field included: highlighting increased demand for rhino horn in Yemen in 2008, showing the drop in Japanese demand for ivory in 2010, detailing a burgeoning ivory trade in Hong Kong in 2011, and explaining the reduction in rhino poaching in Nepal in 2013. His final published research documented how Laos‚Äôs and Vietnam‚Äôs ivory markets are booming.  Death  On February 4, 2018, Martin was found dead with a stab wound to his neck at his home in Nairobi. He was 76 years old. He was survived by his wife and longtime research partner Chryssee Martin. Martin had recently returned from a trip to Myanmar and was writing a report on his findings about ivory trafficking there. Local police reports deemed this murder a ‚Äúrobbery gone wrong.‚Äù However, nothing was stolen. Martin‚Äôs research actively threatened the illicit organizations that profited from wildlife trafficking; therefore his effective muckraking likely made him a target to these criminal organizations, though the case is not closed as of April 2019. In May of 2019, Brooks School posthumously awarded Martin the Distinguished Brooksian Award, in conjunction with what would have been his 60th high school reunion. Martin's former roommate Tony Milbank accepted the award on his behalf. = Public Reaction = Conservationist and WildlifeDirect CEO Dr. Paula Kahumbu tweeted: > \\"It is with deep shock & horror that we learn this morning of the death of > long time conservationist, Esmond Bradley Martin, whom police say died in > suspicious circumstances at his home in Karen, Nairobi.

Early life Maria Branwell's House, Penzance Maria Branwell was the eighth child of twelve born to Thomas Branwell and Anne Carne in Penzance, Cornwall, although only five daughters and one son grew to adulthood. Thomas Branwell was a successful merchant and owned many properties throughout the town. The men of the Branwell family took part in the town's public life, Maria's brother was Mayor in 1809. The family were prominent Methodists, Thomas's sister and two of his daughters married clergymen of Wesleyan leanings. With the Carne family and others, they initiated and developed the first Wesleyan Methodist chapel in Penzance. Courtship and marriage Branwell married Patrick Bront√´ at St. Oswald's Church, Guiseley. Maria met Patrick Bront√´ in 1812 when visiting her aunt Jane and uncle John Fennell in Yorkshire after four family deaths between 1808 and 1812; two of the deaths were her mother's and father's, and aunt Jane was her father's sister. Maria moved to Yorkshire to help her aunt with the household management of a new Methodist training school. John Fennell, a former schoolmaster and Methodist class leader in Penzance and Wellington, Shropshire, was appointed Headmaster of the newly opened Woodhouse Grove School at Rawdon, for the sons of Methodist ministers in 1812. Patrick, during his curacy in Wellington, had known John Fennell in Shropshire's Wesleyan circles. When Fennell was invited to the Yorkshire headship, he needed external examiners for his students and invited Patrick to serve in that capacity at Woodhouse Grove. Maria and Patrick 'loved at first sight' and married within the year. They were married on 29 December 1812 at Guiseley Parish Church by mutual friend Reverend William Morgan, who, on the same day, married Jane and John Fennell's daughter, Jane Branwell Fennell. Befitting the close family that the Branwells were, also married on that day at the same hour were Maria's youngest sister, Charlotte, to her cousin Joseph Branwell at the parish church of Madron in Cornwall. Later life Maria and Patrick's first home was Clough House in Hightown. Their first two children, Maria and Elizabeth were born there in 1813 or 1814 and 1815.Patricia Ingham (2006): The Bront√´s (Oxford University Press), p. xii. Their second home was in Thornton, where their remaining children were born: Charlotte (1816), Patrick Branwell (1817), Emily Jane (1818) and Anne (1820).Glen, Heather. The Cambridge Companion to the Bront√´s. Cambridge companions to literature. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. In 1820 the Bront√´s moved to Haworth. After moving to Haworth, Maria sickened with what may have been uterine or ovarian cancer, or chronic pelvic sepsis and anaemia brought on by the birth of her youngest daughter, Anne. Whatever the cause, Maria died seven and half months later, suffering a long agony; Anne was only twenty months old. Works The only work besides letters that Maria wrote was the essay \\"The Advantages of Poverty, In Religious Concerns.\\" The essay can be found in the book Life and Letters by Clement Shorter.

The installation, in the form of a freestanding building‚Äîspecifically a Prada storefront‚Äîwas inaugurated on October 1, 2005. The artists described the work as a \\"pop architectural land art project.\\" Realized with the assistance of American architects Ronald Rael and Virginia San Fratello, the construction cost $120,000. The original intent was that the building would not be repaired, but would rather gradually degrade into its surroundings. This plan was revised after vandals graffitied the exterior and stole its contents, the night the sculpture was completed. Sculpture Designed to resemble a Prada store, the building is made of \\"adobe bricks, plaster, paint, glass pane, aluminum frame, MDF, and carpet.\\" The installation's door is nonfunctional. On the front of the structure there are two large windows displaying actual Prada wares, shoes and handbags, picked out and provided by Miuccia Prada from the fall/winter 2005 collection; Prada allowed Elmgreen and Dragset to use the Prada trademark for this work. Elmgreen and Dragset originally had wanted to place the sculpture elsewhere and was interested in a \\"Prada Nevada\\", but failed to find support in the state. They were then helped by the New York-based Art Production Fund (APF) which connected the artists with Ballroom Marfa in Marfa, Texas, a center of contemporary art and culture. The installation was then placed at a location northwest of Marfa near Valentine, Texas, where a local artist Boyd Elder served as caretaker for the installation. Prada had previously collaborated with Elmgreen and Dragset in 2001, when the artists attached signage to the Tanya Bonakdar Gallery in New York City with the (false) message \\"Opening soon‚ÄîPRADA\\". Prada Marfa is located relatively close to Donald Judd's Chinati Foundation. The site-specific of Prada Marfa invites for a comparison with other art movements such as minimalism and land art, which are equally dependent on the site where they are placed. Prada Marfa relies almost entirely on its context for its critical effect. The \\"sculptural Intervention\\" can be interpreted as criticism of consumerism, luxury branding and gentrification, but whether intentionally or not, it is also argued it reinforces the capitalist values it criticizes. Therefore, this work of art experienced a change of meaning and gained an ambivalent moment, that the artists did not expect. Along a ledge that runs around the base of the building, hundreds of people have left business cards, weighed down by small rocks. Vandalism The night Prada Marfa formally opened, the building was broken into, its contents (six handbags and 14 right footed shoes) stolen, and the words \\"Dumb\\" and \\"Dum Dum\\", spray painted on the building side walls. The sculpture was quickly repaired. The replacement contents conceal a security system to alert authorities if they are moved. The sculpture subsequently received extensive local and international press coverage. In March 2014, vandals painted the building light blue, hung fake logos for Toms Shoes from the awnings, and posted a political manifesto on the door. Ballroom Marfa issued a statement decrying the vandalism and pledging to restore the site. A Texas artist, 32-year-old Joe Magnano (using the pseudonym 9271977) was subsequently arrested and tried. Magnano pleaded guilty to two counts of misdemeanor criminal mischief and agreed to pay Ballroom Marfa $10,700 in restitution as well as a $1,000 fine. Response from Texas Department of Transportation The installation remained unnoticed by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) until 2013, when Playboy erected a neon bunny nearby along the same stretch of road, which attracted the attention of TxDOT to both installations. TxDOT considered both the Playboy neon bunny and the Prada sign on the Prada Marfa installation to be advertisements, and permits are required to display such signs along a US highway on unlicensed land according to the 1965 Highway Beautification Act. Both installations violated the permitted specifications for billboards, and a demand to remove the neon bunny was issued by the TxDOT, but no immediate decision was made for Prada Marfa. Michael Elmgreen commented on the suggestion that Prada Marfa is an illegal advertisement for Prada: \\"There is no company behind the artwork. It was not commissioned by Prada [...] They never, ever asked me to do advertisement for them.\\" In September 2014, TxDOT officials announced that the structure would be reclassified as a museum, with the Prada Marfa as its only exhibit. This action exempts the structure from the same signage rules that forced the removal of the neon bunny installed by Playboy magazine.

Beaudry Provincial Park was designated a provincial park by the Government of Manitoba in 1974. The park is considered to be a Class III protected area under the IUCN protected area management categories. The park is located within the Winnipeg Ecodistrict in the Lake Manitoba Plain Ecoregion within the Prairies Ecozone. History Beaudry Provincial Park was assembled from several privately owned landholdings along the Assiniboine River. The major portion of the park is a landholding featuring five miles (8 km) of frontage on the south side of the river that had been owned by prominent Winnipeg businessman, mining entrepreneur and civic leader John Draper Perrin. He had purchased a farm from England's Pilkington family (of Pilkington Glass fame) in 1944. The Pilkingtons had owned the property since the early 1920s. J. D. Perrin named the property Beaudry Farm, after Canadian National Railway's Beaudry Station, which was located adjacent to the farm on the CN line originally built by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and used from 1894 to 1972. The Beaudry name had derived from a family that had once owned large sections of land in the area in the early years of the 20th century. After 1950, the property was jointly owned by J. D. Perrin and his son J. D. (Jack) Perrin. The Perrin property was expanded with the purchase in 1963 of the neighbouring farm to the East owned by the Les Fansett family. Around the same time, the Perrins had purchased from CN the abandoned Beaudry Station and relocated it to the bank of the Assiniboine River near the entrance to the present park's riverbottom forest hiking and skiing trails. These trails had been hand cut through the riverbottom forest area for horseback trail riding by Jack Perrin's children, John, Suzanne and Marshall. The station building was fully rehabilitated and used by J. D. Perrin and his wife Ruth as a country retreat until it was destroyed by fire during the winter of 1977. Jack Perrin and his family had constructed a country house on the riverbank a short distance south of the station house. Under the Perrin family's ownership approximately of the Beaudry property were under cultivation, while the remaining of riverbottom forest and other natural forested habitats were carefully preserved. The entire holding was made off-limits to hunters. Much of the farming was done by Perrin's Farm Manager, Hilbrand Van Wyk, who with his wife Shirley and children were prominent members of the Headingley and St. Fran√ßois Xavier area community. South of the CN line, along a small chain of \\"lakes,\\" known locally by some today as Perrin Lakes, a dam had been built by Ducks Unlimited to preserve the wetlands and while prohibiting hunting, the Perrins permitted the Manitoba Gun Dog Association for many years to operate a seasonal clubhouse for dog training and trials.

The station moved its studios and its transmitter tower to its present location, the Bombo Radyo Vigan Broadcast Center in Tamag, in 1984, a few years after joining the Bombo Radyo network; and a few years later the station moved to its current 603 kHz operating frequency (its former operating frequency was at 585 kHz) to improve reception and signal quality. In January 2011 it started broadcasting online via Ustream, and started 24-hour internet broadcasting (with replays of the day's broadcast, for listeners around the world) on February 22, 2011.

Some of his assistants enriched themselves during his reign from the ample funds left in the treasury by Emmanuel I. Their peculation mostly went unchecked by the patriarch, though  øAbdisho ø dismissed one or two men in his entourage whose misdeeds were too scandalous to escape notice.Mari, 102 (Arabic), 90 (Latin) He also did not always discipline his bishops as they deserved. He deposed the arrogant bishop Abraham of Kashkar, who was ruling his diocese with a high hand, but later relented and sent him back to his former diocese of Hamadan.Mari, 103 (Arabic), 91 (Latin) In other respects, however, he was a sound administrator. According to Mari, he consecrated a total of 134 metropolitans and bishops (Bar Hebraeus misquoted this number as 104). At the time of his death only three archdioceses (Merv, Mosul and Erbil, and Basra) did not have an archbishop; and the vacancy in the archdiocese of Basra, due to the death of its metropolitan  øAbd al-Masih, occurred only two days before  øAbdisho ø's own death.Mari, 102 (Arabic), 91 (Latin); Bar Hebraeus, Ecclesiastical Chronicle (ed.

His interest in this mission was recorded by the tenth-century Nestorian writer Abu'lfaraj, who met a Nestorian monk in Baghdad in 987 who had recently returned from China: > In the year 377 of the Arabs [AD 987], in the Christian quarter behind the > church, I met a monk from Najran who seven years before had been sent by the > catholicus to China with five other clergy to set in order the affairs of > the Christian church. I saw a man still young and of a pleasant appearance, > but he spoke little and did not open his mouth except to answer the > questions which were put to him. I asked him for some information about his > journey, and he told me that Christianity was just extinct in China; the > native Christians had perished in one way or another; the church which they > had used had been destroyed; and there was only one Christian left in the > land. The monk, having found no one remaining to whom his ministry could be > of any use, returned more quickly than he went.

The film is a remake by the director of his 1933 film Doss House. Pianist Mark Hambourg appears in a small role. Plot At the age of 18, orphaned Peter Henderson leaves school in the middle of the term (after winning a cricket match) to take over the family firm, one of the most important in the City of London, as arranged by his late father. Cartwright, one of the company directors, tries to retain control of the decision-making, but Peter follows his father's explicit instructions to learn about the business. One day, Peter asks an employee about what occupies a certain city block his firm wants to demolish. (Cartwright and his cronies are secretly trying to enrich themselves.) The man tells him about Charlie's, a dosshouse. Peter and a former schoolmate disguise themselves to look the place over. While they are there, Charlie notifies everyone that the establishment will be closing soon, as it and the neighbouring tenements will be demolished. Inky, one of the residents, consults lawyer \\"Lincoln's Inn\\". He has kept away from his beautiful daughter, cabaret performer Sylvia Meadows, because of his forgery and blackmailing past. He thinks he is the reason Sylvia has not married noted cricketer Stuart Gordon; Lincoln agrees to see what he can do. Peter eavesdrops when Charlie consults with Lincoln, and learns that Cartwright is involved in the eviction and is coming to Charlie's tomorrow. Inky sends a letter to his daughter via Peter, but she does not believe he can keep his word, as he has been unable to do so in the past. When Inky is told, he commits suicide for her sake; he leaves behind a letter which also reveals that he forged the signature of John Henderson on a document which he believes has something to do with the closing of Charlie's. However, Lincoln states they need to get their hands on some of Cartwright's papers as corroboration. They make Tich, a resident of Charlie's, look like a gentleman to use his nimble fingers. They go to Cartwright's suite, where Tich knocks out the butler, then opens the safe. With the information obtained, Peter informs Charlie's residents that his company will rebuild a new and better Charlie's.

Martin has numerous industry credits, not limited to having front-page articles in Polyhedron, as well as being a finalist for the Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming. Martin has authored or co-authored dozens of modules for various platforms including AD&D;, True Dungeon, and Marvel Superheroes. Martin was the president of Dwarven Forge LLC since 2004 until 2014, a company that specializes in hand painted miniature terrain. He has been the lead developer, or co-developer on several Dwarven Forge miniature terrain sets. He has guided two successful Kickstarter projects for Dwarven Forge. Personal life Martin was born in Mt. Carmel, Illinois, United States, and currently lives in southern Illinois with his wife and two children. His main hobby is presenting the True Dungeon event at Gen Con Indy every year, but he enjoys the company of his family and friends whenever possible. Martin grew up in a thriving gaming community, having a fond affinity for hobby games from a young age. Martin has been attending the Gen Con gaming convention for over 30 years, and has been a part of the gaming community for just as long. Martin won the first ever RPGA D&D; Masters Tournament at Gen Con 20, in 1985. He was also part of a small team of designers involved in the play testing of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons second edition. When asked what his childhood heroes were: > \\"My heroes growing up were Col. Hogan and Capt. Kirk. I loved the fact that > they could always think themselves out of a situation. It kind of set me up > to love D&D; since the game greatly promotes creative problem solving.\\" Martin started playing Dungeons and Dragons in 1978 when he happened upon a rulebook at a neighbor's house. He has been playing D&D; pretty regularly since, as well as enjoying some classic war games like Third Reich and Dawn Patrol. Martin has dabbled in every trend that has hit the market except collectible card games, as he said \\"I was too long an old fart to play them (laugh).\\" When asked what his favorite games are: > \\"Of course, there is D&D; in all its incarnations as well as Third Reich, > Dawn Patrol, Hyborian War(PBM), Car Wars, Battletech and Thief (series). I > have designed several home-brew games, with a slider dice game known as > Regent being my favorite.\\" Publishing in Polyhedron Martin has been published in the gaming magazine Polyhedron numerous times. Dwarven Forge Martin has been closely involved with the design of the Dwarven Forge Miniature Terrain. Dwarven Forge is a company that specializes in hand painted, ultra high quality miniature terrain for tabletop gaming. While Dwarven Forge used to specialize in fantasy settings, it has branched out recently, releasing three unique science fiction terrain sets. Martin started working in the Dwarven Forge booth at Gen Con as a volunteer in 2000, when he noticed Dwarven Forge creator Stefan Pokorny scrambling with others to get the booth open in time. He ended up giving up the rest of his time during Gen Con to help, due to the big response created by the release of D&D; 3.0. Over the next few years, Martin managed the Dwarven Forge booths at Origins and Gen Con Indy. Eventually, in 2004, Pokorny asked Martin to manage the company while Pokorny stepped back from the day-to- day operations. Since then, Martin has changed the Dwarven Forge business model from a classic \\"sold in store\\" approach, to a \\"direct to gamers\\" distribution via their website and game conventions. Martin has developed many sets inside his tenure at Dwarven Forge, and he is especially proud of the Den of Evil and Realm of the Ancient limited-edition product lines. When asked about the creation of Dwarven Forge, Martin said: > \\"Dwarven Forge was the brainchild of a talented artist and DM Stefan Pokorny > who wanted to make something really cool for his players. He dreamed up a > modular 3D tile system and he chose polystone as the best medium for his > sculptures. He took a huge risk placing an order for his creations, and the > responses was incredible.

Its mission was defined as: \\"a territorial agency with appropriate staff designed to coordinate or prepare to initiate the execution of all plans for the employment of Army Forces and installations against enemy action in that portion of the United States lying within the command boundaries.\\"Conn, p. 28 This organization was charged with coordinating the defense of the Atlantic Coast, replacing the New England Defense Sector, an organization of the U.S. First Army. However, this did not initially occur, and the command was little more than a planning agency until 24 December 1941. Following the U.S. entry into World War II on 8 December 1941, the functions of the Northeast Defense Command were placed in a larger operational command, the Eastern Theater of Operations (following the example of the Western Theater of Operations established on the west coast) on 24 December, but the command was renamed the Eastern Defense Command on 20 March 1942.Conn, p. 29, 33‚Äì39 After 24 December, the command exercised control over Army coast defense, antiaircraft, and fighter assets from Maine through Florida. This specifically included the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida (minus the western half of the Panhandle), as well as the District of Columbia. The command also included US Army forces in Newfoundland and, from April 1942, Bermuda.Map of Continental Defense Organization, from Conn The initial subordinate commands included First Army, the First and Third Air Forces, and the First, Second, and Third Corps areas. However, in January 1942 the Third Air Force was moved inland and placed under Air Force Combat Command. In September 1943 First Army and First Air Force were separated from the EDC.Conn, pp. 39‚Äì40, 44 The 26th Infantry Division (26th ID) was initially available to the Eastern Defense Command for mobile defense, stationed in the command's area from December 1941 through mid-1943, though it may have been relieved of this duty earlier. In early 1942 this division was augmented by several regimental combat teams, primarily regiments detached from divisions being \\"triangularized\\" (reducing from four infantry regiments to three).Conn, p. 95 The 104th Infantry Regiment of the 26th ID continued on mobile defense duty through January 1943.'Massachusetts own 104th U.S. Infantry Regiment', published and distributed under the Auspices of the 104th U.S. Infantry Regiment Veterans' Association. The other units included at least the 111th, 113th, 181st (detached from the 26th ID), 366th, and 372nd Infantry Regiments. The 144th Infantry Regiment transferred in from the Western Defense Command in January 1943 and was withdrawn in March 1944. The mobile defense force lasted at least through early 1944.Conn, pp. 36‚Äì39Stanton, pp. 101‚Äì102, 217, 224, 232, 252 The commanding generals of the defense commands were initially the commanders of the existing continental army commands established under the 1921 amendment to the National Defense Act of 1916 (First through Fourth Armies). The first commander of the Eastern Defense Command was First Army commander Lieutenant General Hugh A. Drum. The command's headquarters was co- located with First Army headquarters and a soon-to-be-established Second Service Command Corps Area at Fort Jay, Governors Island in New York City. Lieutenant General George Grunert assumed command of the Eastern Defense Command upon Drum's mandatory retirement at age 64 in October 1943. As prospects for any enemy attack on the United States all but diminished, Central Defense Command was merged into the Eastern Defense Command on 15 January 1944. In early 1945, Southern Defense Command was also absorbed by the Eastern Defense Command.Conn, p. 44 With Grunert's retirement in July 1945, his deputy, Brigadier General Kenneth Lord, became interim commander until the appointment of General Jonathan M. Wainwright. This was Wainwright's first command since he was compelled to surrender the Philippines to the Japanese Army in early 1942. In August 1945, he was liberated from a Japanese prisoner of war camp and assumed command after he returned to full duty. Upon Wainwright's 15 January 1946 transfer to Fourth Army at Fort Sam Houston, Lord assumed interim command until the abolition of Eastern Defense Command on 15 March 1946. Its residual staff and functions were transferred to 39th Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, Special Troops, First Army as it returned from its combat assignment in Europe to its initial stateside posting at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

Headquartered in Singapore. The group's engineering divisions specialise in energy-related engineering, water & wastewater engineering and industrial real estate solutions. Boustead also has a geo- spatial technology arm which distributes Esri geographic information systems to major markets across Australia and South East Asia. Boustead is listed on the MSCI Global Small Cap Index for Singapore and the FTSE ST Small Cap Index. History =Early history= Edward Boustead, an English businessman, founded Boustead & Co in 1828. The trading company specialised in import and export, offering goods such as banca tin, spices, saps, rattan, medicinal herbs, silk and tea widely available in South East Asia in exchange for Western products like cloth, oil and machinery. With the development of a wide trading network in Singapore, trade credit and finance became increasingly important to banks, merchants, manufacturers and traders. Boustead & Co, being one of the largest trading houses of the Far East, was the first agent for Hongkong and Shanghai Bank in Singapore, offering banking facilities, accepting and discounting bills, giving loans and accepting deposits. =Establishment of commodity markets= By 1899, Singapore had become the world's main exporter of tin. Boustead & Co played a leading role as promoter and investor in the tin smelting facility on Pulau Brani, constructed by the Straits Trading Company. From that point onwards, Straits Tin became one of the leading businesses of Boustead & Co. During the late 1880s, Boustead & Co introduced rubber trees into Malaysia using seeds germinated by Sir Henry Wickham at London's Botanical Gardens located in Kew. Boustead & Co went on to be a leading rubber plantation manager and owner in Malaysia, acting as secretaries, registrars and agents for 49 plantations with a total planted area of . The company played a pioneering role in the development of commodity markets for tin, oil, rubber and palm oil, among other commodities. All of these commodities played important roles in global development and industrialisation. In 1892, Boustead handled the first shipment of bulk oil to Penang. Shortly after, the Shell Trading and Transport Company was formed. Isaac Henderson, a Boustead partner was one of the founding directors of the new company, now known simply as Shell. Boustead & Co represented Shell in its products including kerosene, motor spirit and fuel oil for shipping in Singapore and Penang, along with fabricating many installations for Shell's facility on Pulau Bukom. =Shipping and marketing business= By the 1860s, Boustead & Co entered the shipping and insurance business, to capture trading opportunities arising from the opening of the Suez Canal. The company's shipping division was the largest in Singapore, with 1,000 vessels in port which represented 60 owners and handled 500,000 tonnes per year. Boustead represented over 20 major shipping lines and numerous insurance agencies including the renowned Lloyd's, which Boustead represented for more than one century.Chew, Melanie (2008). \\"Boustead 1828\\", p. 42. Later on, the company diversified into businesses such as estate management, marketing and mining. The marketing division was the brand agent responsible for introducing some of the world's greatest brands to Singapore and the region. Boustead built a reputation as one of the most sought-after managing agencies of the Far East, and distributed and marketed brands such as Baileys, Bacardi, Cadbury's, Del Monte, Dornbracht, Dow Consumer Products, Dupont Corian, Gillette, Hennessy, Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical, Jacobs Manufacturing, Jim Beam, Jockey, Johnnie Walker, Kao, Lloyd's, Maidenform, Martini & Rossi, Moet & Chandon, Nestle, Nissan, Ovaltine, Pedigree, Poggenpohl, Procter & Gamble, Sandvik, Shell, Slazenger, Smirnoff, Speedo, Suzuki, Thomas Cook, Trebor and Villeroy & Boch. =War and restructuring= Due to major political changes in Malaya and Singapore, the period of 1957 to 1965 saw Boustead & Co divided into three separate companies in Singapore, the United Kingdom and Malaysia. Each company carried the same name and was listed on their respective stock exchanges. Boustead Singapore Limited was listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange on 17 October 1975. After the split, Boustead Singapore lost control of most of the assets and properties, which by default went to Malaysia due to their geographical presence. However, Boustead Singapore's trading arm held many contracts for the marketing and distribution of consumer goods, while the engineering division sought out new markets for its design and project management services. The company was able to grow its business, under the leadership of Boustead executives who had been with the company for a long time. The nature of the company's businesses in Singapore also began to change, with activities focused mainly on manufacturing and technical services. =New leadership= In 1996, Wong Fong Fui bought over Boustead Singapore, with the company centering its core operations on infrastructure- related engineering services and geo-spatial technology.Sreenivasan, Ven (June 2008). \\"The changing fortunes of Boustead\\". Pulses Magazine Prominent people associated with Boustead's history Wealthy Malacca-born merchant, Chia Ann Siang joined Boustead & Co in 1848. During his time with Boustead & Co, he became a partner of the firm Geok Teat and Company. After working for 42 years, Chia decided to retire and went into the timber business. He was a wealthy landowner and a leading merchant in Singapore's history. Chia purchased a small hill which used to be the homes of clan associations and shophouses, named after himself as Ann Siang Hill. Edward Boustead commissioned George Coleman, the Irish leading architect of Singapore at that time, to design and build the headquarters of Boustead & Co. The warehouse was known as the house of seven and twenty pillars\\", located around the corner from High Street.Chew, Melanie (2008). \\"Boustead 1828\\". Boustead & Co, p. 7. In 1834, Boustead partnered with German-born merchant, Gustav Christian Schwabe in the Singapore company. Schwabe and his cousin established Sykes Schwabe & Co in Liverpool. The Liverpool partner would export products like textiles, biscuits, brandies and steel to the East, while the Singapore partner would trade with Eastern produce such as coffee and spices. Singapore merchant, Tan Kim Seng, was a middleman in Boustead's trading activities.Maclean Roderick. \\"A Pattern of Change ‚Äì The Singapore International Chamber of Commerce from 1837\\". The Chamber and its Founding Fathers, pp. 17 ‚Äì 27 Tan was also a good friend of Edward Boustead. He helped to amass small shipments of produce from local traders for Boustead, who would then ship the produce to the West. Tan was well known for his contribution towards the building of Singapore's first public waterworks in 1857. Boustead & Co had a successful investment business in commodities, ships and properties, bringing new companies to the London Stock Exchange and private investors. Edward Boustead himself was a trusted advisor to retirees who wanted to invest their retirement and pension funds. One of these retirees was Captain Thomas Douglas Scott who was master mariner of Laju, the largest and fastest sailing ship on the China Seas in the late 1800s.

The focus on interdisciplinarity derives in part from Melinda French Gates' own interdisciplinary melding of the fields of computer science, economics, and business, as does its emphasis on inter-generational collaboration and mentoring, given her experience as an undergraduate and professional school student at Duke University. Significant financial need is one of the primary criteria for consideration by the USP, along with academic excellence and socioeconomic diversity. The USP's combination of financial need, inter-generational scholarship support, and commitment to funding educational opportunities to students from diverse backgrounds provided the preliminary framework for some of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's subsequent philanthropic endeavors, notably the Gates Millennium Scholars, established in 1999 with a $1 billion grant. The University Scholars Program works closely with the Duke Office of Undergraduate Students and Fellows and is one of several merit scholarships available to matriculating Duke students. It is the only merit scholarship program at Duke that includes a graduate and professional school community along with an undergraduate constituency. Program Undergraduate University Scholars are given a grant to cover tuition, room, board, and fees associated with Duke for four years of undergraduate study. Every year, approximately 30 Duke applicants are identified for consideration by the University Scholars Program based their family's financial need and on their ability to explore new academic horizons. There is no direct application process to the University Scholars Program. Rather, Duke's Office of Undergraduate Admissions forwards those outstanding applicants applying for financial aid to the Office of Undergraduate Scholars and Fellows, who determines suitability for consideration by the USP. A reading committee including the Director of the University Scholars Program along with Duke faculty and advisors evaluates each application in detail. The applicants come to Duke for a finalist weekend in the spring of their high school senior year, during which they stay with current University Scholars, explore Duke, attend classes, and conduct an interview with a panel of faculty, graduate students, professional school students, and undergraduate students associated with the USP. According to the USP website, scholars \\"represent a range of personal and intellectual backgrounds and share an excitement for original research, collaborative thinking, and innovative scholarship.\\" Undergraduate scholars are also given the opportunity to use up to 7000 dollars for a summer enrichment program. Valid enrichment programs help the scholar grow intellectually and help the scholar prepare for a career, graduate school, or a senior thesis. The funding must be used for costs associated with travel, program fees, and living expenses. Graduate University Scholars receive tuition support for the first year of graduate school. They are selected from the top applicants to individual graduate programs at Duke University by departmental Directors of Graduate Studies who nominate and rank graduate applicants for several merit scholarship available to graduate student. These graduate merit scholarships include Duke's J.B. Duke Scholarship, the Dean's Graduate Award Fellowship, and/or the W.H. Gardner Society of Engineering Fellowship. The Graduate School reviews the nominations and provides details to the Director of the University Scholars Program. The USP Director selects graduate students based on a clear interdisciplinary agenda for graduate study along with experience or potential for mentoring undergraduate students. Graduate students participate in the University Scholars Program throughout their tenure at Duke. They are eligible to apply for additional funding to support travel and participation in interdisciplinary conferences as well as a Graduate Mentor Award for outstanding commitment and mentoring within the University Scholars Program. Professional School University Scholars also receive tuition support for the first year of professional school study. Professional school University Scholars are chosen by each of Duke's seven professional schools: The Divinity School, the Fuqua School of Business, the Nicholas School of the Environment, the School of Law, the School of Medicine, the School of Nursing, and the Sanford School of Public Policy. Many professional school University Scholars pursue joint degrees with other professional schools at Duke or within the Graduate School. They similarly demonstrate significant financial need, academic merit, and socioeconomic diversity. Like graduate students in the University Scholars Program, professional school students also participate in the USP throughout their time at Duke. They are also eligible to apply for interdisciplinary conference travel funding and the USP Graduate Mentor Award. Activities The University Scholars have a variety of activities to help develop a community of friendliness and intellectual discussion. Each fall, all USP scholars (sometimes called \\"Unis\\") take a 2-day weekend retreat to discuss the principles of the program and the goals for the year. Throughout the semester, the USP hosts numerous seminars led by USP scholars or faculty members. Additionally, informal \\"coffees\\" are arranged to facilitate discussion of non-academic issues of interest, ranging from organic farming in Europe to senior theses. Each spring, the USP holds a daylong symposium that explores a specific topic from the perspective of a variety of disciplines. This typically involves a keynote speaker followed by panels of University Scholars who discuss a certain aspect of the topic from the perspective of their respective disciplines.

The film depicts two Edinburgh bodysnatchers closely modeled on the real Burke and Hare. Plot In 1828 Edinburgh, Scotland, two Irish immigrants, Mr. Hart (Tod Slaughter) and Mr. Moore (Henry Oscar), take up murdering the locals and selling their bodies to the local medical school, which needs fresh bodies for anatomy lectures and demonstrations. When a young woman goes missing, medical student Hugh Alston (Patrick Addison) suspects the two are involved in foul play, but the arrogant, amoral Dr. Cox (Arnold Bell) ‚Äì the main buyer for the bodies ‚Äì attempts to hinder his investigation. Meanwhile, the murderous duo set their sights on eccentric local boy \\"Daft Jamie\\" (Aubrey Woods) and an old woman.

Production The film was originally made as a fairly direct historical adaptation of the Burke and Hare murders. The British Board of Film Censors, however, insisted that all references to the real-life murderers be removed. The film was then re-titled and re-dubbed with different character names, substituting \\"Hart\\" and \\"Moore\\" for Hare and Burke, respectively, and \\"Dr. Cox\\" for Dr. Knox. All other names, including victims Mary Patterson, Mrs. Docherty, and \\"Daft Jamie\\" Wilson, remain unchanged. Writer John Gilling would go on to script another version of the same story in 1960, titled The Flesh and the Fiends. This version used the correct names for the killers. The film was made at Bushey Studios. Distribution The film was distributed in the United States by J.H. Hoffberg Productions in 1953, slightly edited, as Horror Maniacs.

Bloomfield left the role in late 1999, before returning in early 2001 and departing in early 2003. She returned in a guest role in mid-2007 and again in a full-time role in late 2009 before departing once again in late 2016. Arriving as part of the McKenna family unit, Rachel debuted in early 1993 alongside her mother Alex (Liddy Holloway), the estranged wife of Clinic Director Michael McKenna (Paul Gittins). The family were later joined by Rachel's homosexual brother Jonathon (Kieren Hutchison). Originally a love interest for \\"heart throb\\" Stuart Neilson (Martin Henderson), Rachel would go through numerous boyfriends and four husbands including a \\"will they, won't they?\\" romance with Chris Warner (Michael Galvin), spanning more than 15 years. She was known for her covering of \\"ethical issues\\" such as storylines that featured bulimia, near death experiences, alcoholism, student loan protests, child abuse and being hit by lightning. Her friendship with Nick Harrison (Karl Burnett) spanned numerous years, saw the two become an iconic coupling and even become briefly married during a protest about student allowances. The character is one of the shows longest running characters and has been labelled hugely iconic. Many of her story lines have been praised, such as her relationships and \\"ethical storylines\\". Bloomfield has been celebrated for her portrayal, winning several awards including \\"Best Actress\\" and \\"Sexiest Female\\" in TV Guide reader polls. Creation and casting To widen demographic audiences, producers ensured Shortland Street featured family units so that several key characteristics could be met (middle aged parents, teenage children). In mid-1992 it was decided to expand on the established character, Michael McKenna (Paul Gittins) (who had appeared since the show's first episode), by introducing his family. The soap's key demographic was teenage girls and as such, a 16-year-old daughter was created in the form of Rachel McKenna. She was given instant romance connections by being penned as a love interest for established \\"heart throb\\", Stuart Neilson (Martin Henderson). Angela Bloomfield won the role in August 1992 and did not realise the significance of the show nor the character until much later. She was signed to an initial 5-week contract. Rachel's first scenes involved her leaving the shower in just a towel, an experience Bloomfield described as, \\"terrifying\\". Bloomfield believed the role took over her life and that she, \\"used Rachel to become capable of having a huge argument with partner or parents. After a couple of years I decided I wasn't being true to myself.\\" The storyline where Rachel became an alcoholic proved too heavy for Bloomfield, and to relax following such intense scenes, Bloomfield performed meditation with co-star, Robyn Malcolm (Nurse Ellen Crozier). By the late nineties, Bloomfield had grown sick of the role and quit. The character made her last appearance on 23 September 1999. Rachel was written off in a storyline that saw her leave the country, purposely done in case Bloomfield wished to reprise the role at a later date. Executive producer Tony Holden asked Bloomfield to reprise the role several times over the next year, to which she declined for a later date. However she soon started to miss the job and when she was offered the role again in late 2000, happily accepted. Television New Zealand assured fans they would not be let down by Rachel's return alongside original character Chris Warner (Michael Galvin), as they would bring a lot of \\"spice\\" to the soap. Rachel made her return on screen on 5 February 2001. However once again Bloomfield felt weighed down by the role and found it difficult to stand such a hard nosed character. As the character of Rachel developed into a cold and bitter alcoholic, Bloomfield found herself struggling to identify with her like she previously had, \\"I think I've grown up, while recently Rachel seems to have regressed.\\" She found the storyline where Rachel had her tubes tied and later shook a baby too hard to do and when producers refused to tone the character down, she quit the show and left in 2002. Bloomfield commented, \\"Throughout my twenties, I have concentrated almost totally on the show ... But at the same time I've had to grow personally and I did that by myself ... Now it is time for me to put those books down and spend the next 10 years just living.\\" Rachel made her last appearance on 14 February 2003. Whilst taking up a role as a director, Bloomfield agreed to briefly reprise the role in a cameo appearance to celebrate the show's 15th anniversary in June 2007. Bloomfield found it unusual acting after having directed for several years, but was made welcome by co star Michael Galvin (Chris Warner), \\"I haven't been in front of the camera on this set for such a long time that it felt weird .... Acting with Michael was the easiest part of the job .... Whenever I was on set with anyone else I was nervous, but when I was with him, I felt relaxed.\\" In early 2009 Bloomfield agreed to reprise the role full-time and was forced to keep the return a secret for much of the year. She signed an initial 9-month contract. Rachel made her reappearance on the show on 23 October 2009. After years of work behind the camera, Bloomfield found her stint a lot more \\"taxing\\" and struggled with Rachel's \\"anti-children\\" sentiment. Following the show's 20th anniversary, Bloomfield acknowledged the importance she had gained due to her longevity and experience on the show, \\"I've realised over time that new actors take their cues from us oldies, just like I did from Elizabeth McRae (Marj Brasch) and Paul Gittins (Michael McKenna). What we do has quite an influence on how they are.\\" In 2013, following the 20th anniversary of Rachel's first appearance on the show, Bloomfield announced her intention to stay on with the show in what she saw as a, \\"perfect fit\\". However the following year after the axing of Amanda Billing (Sarah Potts), Bloomfield decided she would leave the show in the coming years. In 2016 she quit the role. Bloomfield found that Rachel became a \\"middle-man\\", facilitating other characters storylines until her exit storyline. She had been planning to quit for \\"a couple\\" years but it, \\"felt like the right time for me and you know, it is really hard to break away from that show.\\" Producer Maxine Fleming decided Rachel needed an appropriate exit storyline, saying that it, \\"needed to be dramatic and give some sense of closure for Rachel and the characters close to her.\\" It was decided not to kill Rachel off in case Bloomfield wished to reprise the role at a later date. Fleming said killing Rachel was never an option, \\"we've killed off a lot of people and ... you take away the potency if you do it too many times through the years.\\" Rachel made her final appearance on 6 October 2016. Six months later, Bloomfield returned to the show as a director for the show's 25th anniversary. She said she would be happy to return as Rachel to \\"resolve her storyline\\". Storylines Rachel arrived in early 1993 and forced her father Michael (Paul Gittins) to dump his young girlfriend. She became besotted by Stuart Neilson (Martin Henderson) and used a smitten Nick Harrison (Karl Burnett) to get closer to Stuart. She developed bulimia and dumped Stuart when she learnt he had slept with her mother Alex (Liddy Holloway). Rachel started to date Tim Cunningham (Richard Vette) and befriended the pregnant Ramona (Ashleigh Seagar), however a spiteful Charlotte (Nicola Cliff) revealed Tim was the father of Ramona's baby and Rachel dumped him. The following year Rachel dated Manny Atutahi (Albert Belz) but dumped him for Rangi Heremaia (Blair Strang) and also married Nick in a protest on student loans. She studied and became a Social Worker. Her romance with Rangi didn't last and Rachel was presented the local bar \\"Kennedys\\" as a 21st present from her mother. However running the new and improved \\"R Bar\\" only saw Rachel turn from her poor relationship to drinking and she nearly killed Rangi with car fumes whilst passed out drunk. Her alcoholism saw Rachel nearly die in a car crash. Michael returned and helped Rachel overcome her addiction and she ended up getting hit by lightning. The lightning caused her to become temporarily infatuated with Nick with the two nearly sleeping together. Rachel sold the bar and accepted a position as Administration Manager of the clinic. She dated Frank (Christopher Hobbs) but dumped him for Daniel Buchanan (Jack Campbell). She dumped him and dated Frank again before she decided to leave for America. Whilst overseas she married Daniel. She returned two years later for her cousin Waverley's (Claire Chitham) wedding and got involved with Frank once again before he left for Nepal. After deciding to stay in Ferndale permanently, Rachel continued her job as Administration/HR Manager and ended up dumping Frank when Daniel returned. However she soon realised she wanted a divorce and briefly dated Matt McAllister (Roy Snow). She developed a crush on Chris (Michael Galvin) but took up with Jack (Manu Bennett) who kidnapped her and tried to marry her. Chris saved her and the two started a relationship. Rachel became 2IC of the hospital but again turned to alcohol and had a brief flirtation with Zac (Mike Edward) before she nearly died in an explosion. After she returned from rehab, Chris dumped her to be with Donna (Stephanie Tauevihi). She used her connections with Marj Brasch (Elizabeth McRae) to get a job in the government. She returned in 2007 to audit the hospital and it turned out she was engaged. Rachel slept with Chris and unsuccessfully pleaded with him to love her, before leaving. Rachel returned in October 2009 to audit the hospital once again. Declined by Chris for a relationship, Rachel again took up drinking and refused help from estranged husband Jeremy (Eryn Wilson). Passed out at the Christmas party, Kieran Mitchell (Adam Rickitt) used her state to his advantage and framed her for the hit and run death of Morgan Braithwaite (Bonnie Soper). Distraught, Rachel gave up drinking and dated Callum McKay (Peter Mochrie) and worked with him by becoming 2IC of the hospital once again. However Rachel was proven innocent and Chris announced his love. The two finally got together. Rachel struggled to cope with family life while Chris was out of town and had trouble keeping control of son Harry (Reid Walker), eventually losing her cool and smacking him, despite it being illegal in New Zealand. The couple briefly broke up when Chris strayed but Rachel later stood by him when he was wrongly accused of murder. That year Rachel was finally awarded the position of CEO of the hospital, a role her father had held 17 years beforehand. Rachel began to suffer severe anxiety attacks following a political undermining at the hospital and the stress of fostering Jared Afeaki (Beulah Koale) with Chris. Her subsequent weak mindset saw her undermined by Seth Packhurst (Toby Leach), eventually losing her job to him. Rachel assumed many different jobs before becoming a DHB representative. Her and Chris' relationship hit rocks when he suggested they have a child, but the two reconciled and became engaged. Though struggling with Chris' decision to have a child with Grace Kwan (Lynette Forday), the couple finally married and Rachel returned to her role as CEO of the hospital. Following the shock revelation that Grace and Chris had faked a miscarriage together, the married couple separated and Rachel had a brief fling with Garrett Whitley (Spencer Falls). However Rachel soon realised she was still in love with Chris and the two reconciled and purchased a new house together. The arrival of Rachel's former flame during her alcoholic days Glenn Rickman (Will Wallace) caused strain on Rachel and she began to take codeine which turned into an addiction. Glenn drugged Rachel and she briefly relapsed on alcohol and nearly drowned. Strung out and on heavy watch by her family, Rachel made several major organisational mistakes at the hospital and she was stood down. She relapsed again and ruined Lucy's (Grace Palmer) wedding, afterwards deciding to leave Ferndale to get better. She rejected Chris' offer to go with her and departed alone, much to Chris and Harry's dismay. The following year at Chris' 50th birthday, Nick accidentally revealed that Rachel had entered into a new relationship. Character development Earlier appearances of Rachel saw her portrayed as a selfish teenager. =Characterisation= The teenage Rachel was \\"bolshy\\" and vastly different from later appearances, being a lot more selfish. She was said to be clever and attractive and fierce like her mother and was once referred to as a, \\"stroppy little madam who always has to get her own way.\\" When Bloomfield was cast, she read the character synopsis and was pleasantly surprised, \\"That defensive, overconfident, angry little girl. I can do that, for some reason. She was the sarcastic, say-all-the- things-you-want-to-say-but-no-one-ever-does kid ... She felt she had a high status, and though she really didn't, she gave that to herself and that's a self-defence mechanism.\\" Television New Zealand described her first love as being with, \\"her mother's credit card\\" and it was noted that by 1995, Rachel had become the \\"hippest\\" thing on New Zealand television due to her parents fortune allowing her to have a vast wardrobe. This was said to be a large change from the \\"schoolgirl in a miniskirt\\" who first arrived to the show in 1993. She was said to be physically mature but mentally had a lot of growing to do and also had a \\"ruthless streak\\". Bloomfield described the teenage Rachel as \\"messed up\\" but praised this aspect of her personality as it allowed her to play \\"a whole array of emotions\\". The character is known for her \\"sharp tongue\\" and \\"quick wit\\". By the mid nineties, it was said that Rachel had, \\"acquired a calmer approach to life and is looking at the bigger picture for the first time. Now she's into helping others besides herself and is learning to take more of the good with the bad.\\" Bloomfield has stated that due to the characters personality being; \\"hostile, caustic and aggressive\\", it made it difficult to continuously play the role. Rachel is known to cover \\"ethical storylines\\" over melodrama, something which Bloomfield believes leads Rachel to act like she does. Bloomfield believed Rachel was a true portrayal of a working woman in the 21st century, stating, \\"Rachel represents many modern women. She's crammed so much into her twenties that it's almost as if she needs to step back and reassess her life.\\" During Rachel's 2007 return, Bloomfield described her as not being, \\"completely the same Rachel. She's all about work now, any time they discuss her personal life she brings it back to how it supports her work agenda.\\" Bloomfield realised while at voice training, that she did not like Rachel as a person and would struggle to be friends with her in reality. Producer Steven Zanoski described Rachel's personality as; \\"Independent, feisty and always quotable\\". Rachel has been described as the person who; \\"says all those things you're too scared to say but you wish you could. She'll do it her way, thanks very much, and she doesn't suffer fools.\\" Upon her return in 2009, Rachel took on a more antagonistic role, being labelled a \\"villain\\" and a \\"home-wrecker\\". Rachel has been described as a \\"glossy little rich bitch\\" and a \\"bossy boots\\". Bloomfield found it hard to understand some of Rachel's personal motives, saying; \\"She doesn't need to be liked, but she likes to be loved and respected. So although I don't believe she is at one with herself she is hopeful. There haven't been too many triumphs for Rachel.\\" Bloomfield believed that Rachel acted differently depending on whom she was with, \\"there were a few she loved and when you saw her feel protected and loved you got to see a softer side of her. But then again, when the shit hits the fan, all she can fall back on is self- preservation. She's very flawed in a way where she didn't realise people could see her flaws but it doesn't take much to pick holes in her.\\" =The McKenna family= Shortland Street has a constant thoroughfare of family units to help attract and widen the target demographics. In 1992 Adrian Keeling who portrayed patriarch of the Neilson family unit, Tom, quit his role in the soap. Producers realised there would be a notable gap in demographics and the decision was made to expand on the already established character of hospital CEO, Michael McKenna (Paul Gittins). The McKenna family arrived to screens in early 1993. A writer of the show, Liddy Holloway, was cast as Michael's estranged wife Alex McKenna and Gittins would often joke that she wrote her character the best lines. Also in the family unit were teenagers, Rachel and Jonathon McKenna (Kieren Hutchison). The character of Jonathon was written as gay and the storyline proved both controversial and groundbreaking, with Michael's reluctance to accept his son highly topical. Rachel and Jonathon's relationship was depicted as that of a typical brother and sister, as it was said Jonathon was, \\"protective of his baby sister but often finds himself competing wither her for parental funds and attention.\\" The family unit also saw the introduction of Alex's niece, Waverley Wilson (Claire Chitham), who stayed on the soap for many years, becoming one of its most iconic characters. Bloomfield became good friends with Chitham, who helped her give up smoking. The family dynamics that were brought on by the McKennas, were later praised with the show receiving a makeover in 2001 to try and comply with the benchmark set by Michael and his family. The family was later compared to Shortland Street's equivalent of the Royal family. The McKenna family disbanded in 1995 when Michael and Alex departed the show. Jonathon appeared in several more stints while Rachel stayed as a central character on the soap for many years. The departures of the McKenna family made a large impact on Rachel, with Bloomfield citing her parent's divorce and Jonathon's absence as reasons behind Rachel being \\"vulnerable\\". When Bloomfield quit in 1999, Hutchison was scared that the iconic McKenna family would permanently be gone from the show, but was delighted when she returned several years later. Gittins enjoyed the introduction of the family unit, stating; \\"I started off as a single character, and then the family was created. I really enjoyed the father-daughter relationship because I have a young daughter. The McKenna family was incredibly dysfunctional. I enjoyed that ... We were the totally '90s dysfunctional family: conflict between the husband and wife, rebellious daughter, gay son, a wife living close to the edge, alcoholism, workaholicism, and stress. It was more exciting ‚Äì and made for good drama.\\" In 2002, Alex returned to the show after faking her death 4 years beforehand. Producer Harriet Crampton believed the strained relationship between her and Rachel worked as a result of longevity, \\"We could only do that with a character who's been on the show for so long that we know she has issues in her past.\\" The two surviving members of the McKenna family reunited in 2011 after 15 years, when Jonathon returned to the show in a 6-month recurring stint. Hutchison was quoted as saying: \\"It was really nice to have some familiar faces in the building. Being able to work with Angela and Michael [Galvin] (Chris Warner) again has been fantastic.\\" Rachel was at first touched with the thought that Jonathon had returned to reconnect with his family, though it was soon obvious he had only returned to seek brain surgery after a devastating car crash. The relationship between the two characters maintained its level of closeness, with Bloomfield explaining the McKenna family, \\"don't cuddle .... there's always something else going on.\\" Though overjoyed at the return of Hutchison to the set, to make the partnership believable, Bloomfield had to get reminded to keep the sibling-ship at arm's length, \\"We constantly have to be reminded that the (emotional) stuff doesn't come easily for Rachel and Jonathon. There was a scene where Jonathan said, 'I love you' and we had to act like 'Uuughgh!' .... If my own brother had said that I'd say, 'I love you too.'\\" Bloomfield believed that the absence and early deaths of Rachel's parents influenced the characters development, \\"She lost them way too soon and she was alone in the world and all she had to fall back on was how they were, which is 'play hard or go home and don't put up with people's bullshit'. So she's really brittle and hard but didn't suffer fools and got to say really good lines.\\" =Ethical issues= Shortland Street is often used by producers as a tool to tackle large issues in a method to provide drama and character development. Rachel's storyline's would often see her participate in these \\"ethical issues\\". By the time Rachel was just 17 on the soap, she had already featured in some of the soap's most, \\"challenging story lines\\". One of Rachel's earliest story lines in 1993, was the revelation she was suffering from bulimia, a highly topical illness at the time. Bloomfield thought it was important to correctly portray Rachel's diagnosis of both bulimia and anorexia, \\"It's very rare for people to have bulimia and then anorexia. So I wanted people to understand that there are different symptoms for each. Even now there are scenes with Rachel McKenna that revolve around food that are really funny. Do you ever see her eating? No. ... We just had to spell it out because so many young kids just see her and think, 'Oh look, she's not hungry at this time of the morning and she's not eating, so why should I?\\" Another high-profile storyline saw Rachel discover she had chlamydia and a storyline where hairdressers found nit's in her hair. Bloomfield did not wish for Rachel to be seen as a role model, citing her anger, \\"she resorts to some really bad excuses for getting angry.\\" Storylines surrounding Rachel's reluctance to accept her maternal nature were often dealt with, Bloomfield explained, \\"I know she likes children, but ... she'll disguise it with a sarcastic remark. You would only see it when she's alone with the child.\\" In 2009 Rachel returned with what Bloomfield described as an \\"anti-children\\" sentiment but following her relationship with Chris, accepted his sons into her life. By 2014, Rachel was referred to as effectively being Harry Warner's (Reid Walker) mother. A 2001 storyline that saw Jack Hewitt (Manu Bennett) kidnap Rachel, was a feature on mental illness. Jack had bipolar disorder and stopped taking his medication when Rachel dumped him. The resulting episodes saw Jack kidnap Rachel, attempt to murder Chris Warner (Michael Galvin), try to force Rachel to marry him and end up committing suicide. The storyline was met with a hugely negative reception due to its negative stereotyping of those suffering mental illnesses, however a complaint was dismissed by the Broadcasting Standards Authority due to its investigation into the issue. It discovered that the erratic behaviour shown by Jack was not inconsistent with the reality of a person with bipolar disorder who had failed to take medication. A storyline that was set to air in 2002, was to see Rachel discover she was pregnant and have a termination. Though Shortland Street had featured several abortion storylines before, they had not been well received. The 1995 storyline that saw the middle aged Jenny Harrison (Maggie Harper) terminate her child was met with clouds of controversy and many complaints to the Broadcasting Standards Authority. As such, the storyline was reworked in that Rachel had a Tubal ligation instead of an abortion. Nonetheless, Bloomfield was still shocked with the storyline and it led to her 2002 resignation. In 2011 Rachel featured in a storyline where she illegally smacked her partner Chris' son Harry. Rachel was an inexperienced parent and as such, Bloomfield had to forget her own maternal nature, \\"As a mum, my responses are now automatic. So when I was playing Rachel in this role, I tried to forget about what now comes naturally as a parent ... Rachel eventually breaks, and that's when she smacks him. It all happens pretty quickly and she immediately realises she has crossed a line.\\" Bloomfield was uneasy filming the storyline, \\"It felt really inappropriate ‚Äì even filming the scene! But Reid did a fantastic job. He really pulled out all his menace to play that part.\\" Rachel's ethical issues again gained prominence in 2013 with Rachel being the centre of a health storyline. After stress in both her professional and private life, Rachel nearly resorted back to alcohol but was struck by a major panic attack. Later in the year, Rachel started up a charity for homeless people alongside Henry Lee (Peter Huang). In both 2013 and 2014, Rachel was involved in storylines that saw her fight a smoking habit. Rachel was also involved in a 2014 storyline that saw her use an elixir similar to botox. Rachel featured in another addiction storyline in 2016 when she became reliant on Codeine medication. Bloomfield was surprised that the show was covering addiction with Rachel again but believed it made sense as she, \\"supposed in a way they have shifted her addiction from alcohol to codeine.\\" =Alcoholism= A storyline that Rachel was often involved with was her alcoholism, Bloomfield enjoyed acting out the illness, \\"I loved my drinking days and being unstable because there was so much opportunity as an actor to spin out of control, be tortured, then build yourself up again.\\" Rachel was first shown to have an alcohol problem in the late nineties, which Bloomfield thought added to Rachel's positive attitude, \\"she loosened up and slept with the wrong boy and if anything, she probably laughed more.\\" The storyline proved to affect Bloomfield in her own personal life, \\"For that you have to bring yourself to your lowest ebb. I used to come home and cry before I went to sleep. Then I'd think, 'Hang on. I have the best life ‚Äì I am a working actor, I have good friends, I own a home whats wrong with me?\\" Following words from her father Michael (Paul Gittins), whom also was an alcoholic, Rachel stayed off alcohol until a 2002 storyline saw work and relationship issues lead her to return to drinking. Bloomfield noticed a different dynamic in her portrayal than the previous storyline, \\"this time it hasn't been much fun because she's older and she's hiding it from everybody. It's kind of yucky, and she has the potential to lose her job, her friends, and partner.\\" Whilst at the peak of her alcoholism, Rachel crashed her car whilst drink driving, causing an explosion that she narrowly survived. She gave up drinking in 2003, but upon returning 6 years later, Rachel was again back on alcohol. The show's producer at the time told Bloomfield after the storylines conclusion that the show wouldn't be repeating the alcoholic relapse story again. Bloomfield believed that this was \\"probably quite good\\" but did enjoy playing a character with flaws. After again going clean, Rachel nearly resorted back to drinking in early 2013 after suffering from stress in her professional life, but restrained herself. When Bloomfield quit the role in 2016, producers decided to have Rachel undergo a relapse. Bloomfield wanted Rachel to leave with a happy ending but understood \\"they had to leave it in a certain way and create a situation where Michael (Chris Warner) wouldn't follow her. So for me as I started to read it, I was like 'oh I'm bummed'.\\" Rachel ended up leaving Ferndale to recover by herself, with most of the characters \\"hating her.\\" =Nick Harrison= Upon her introduction 8 months into the soap operas airing, Rachel was paired as a friend of established character ‚Äì Nick Harrison (Karl Burnett). The partnership between the two teenage characters worked so effectively due to the solid friendship that occurred between the two actors when Bloomfield joined the show, \\"When I started on Shortland Street we had that common bond so we could sit down and say, 'You went to Massey' .... I was 19, but I was hugely in awe of everyone. I was so scared when I started Shortland Street, so I just watched Karl. He was kind of kooky and uncool but I learned a lot of professional etiquette from him .... I don't know what happened, but over the past five and a half years we just got a lot closer and closer. I guess that's what having a friend is like. We're always supportive of each other. He's a darling.\\" Storylines between the two characters were often comical, including Bloomfield's highlight where Nick chained himself to a boat during a race, whilst Rachel dressed up as a mermaid and nearly drowned. Rachel was always intended to be a love interest for established character, Stuart Neilson (Martin Henderson), but Nick developed a one time crush on her upon her arrival that for the most part, went forever unrequited. Rachel's parents were in the middle of a separation at the time Nick met her and as such she ended up leaning on him for support. Bloomfield explained that Rachel, \\"saw a side to Nick she'd never seen before.\\" In 1995 Rachel married best friend and comical character, Nick Harrison (Karl Burnett) in a protest on student allowance. The storyline not only advanced the plot, but also depicted current events of the time. In 1995 a highly topical storyline went underway between the two characters when they married in a ceremony that would benefit them a larger student allowance for tertiary education. Not only did the storyline break up the romance storyline between Nick and Rachel's cousin Waverley (Claire Chitham), but it was also a reflection on current events of the time. Producers used the wedding tactically to draw in viewers, releasing much of the storyline to a news outlet prior to the storyline unfolding so that viewers would commit beforehand to watch it. The storyline reportedly struck a chord with students despite the marriage being solely for convenience. As the wedding storyline aired, Bloomfield noted the special bond between the two characters, \\"With what we're doing now, the two of us are really close. So it just shows that no matter what kind of break there is between seeing each other, Rachel and Nick will always be there for each other\\". Throughout the mid to late nineties, the characters of Rachel, Nick, Fergus Kearney, and Minnie Crozier often shared scenes together due to their age and installed the soap archetype of \\"hip, young things\\". This further developed the relationship between the two characters. In 1998 Bloomfield was shocked to discover an upcoming storyline would see her character fall in love with Nick. She soon learned that it was all part of a comical storyline for the two, \\"The script said, 'She's so in love with Nick, she wants this...' and I am like, 'No, calm down, it will be a joke.' The next minute Karl walked in the room and every- one just cracked up laughing. I felt so embarrassed. Then I went back and read the scenes before it and saw that Rachel had been struck by lightning.\\" She described the lightning storyline as \\"something from Days of Our Lives ‚Äì just without the amnesia!\\" Bloomfield was embarrassed and nervous throughout the kissing scenes and Burnett agreed with her behaviour, \\"It was really strange. It would have been like me kissing my sister which is really, gross. It was just really weird being that close to each other. I hope we don't ever have to do it again.\\" Bloomfield believed the lightning bolt brought out a personality change in Rachel. \\"She doesn't want to sit down and have an intelligent conversation with Nick, she wants to jump into bed with him.\\" The storyline culminated in Nick recording himself farting and eating onions in an attempt to rid Rachel's attraction, though all failed and he eventually decided to sleep with her. However, as they about to consummate the relationship, Rachel was shocked by the bedside light and returned to normal. That year Rachel accepted a new job in the clinic that would see the character share less screentime with Nick, Bloomfield explained the situation, \\"I'm not acting all the time with Karl now, which I miss, but which is also quite good for me.\\" Following the death of Nick's partner Angela Weaver (Katherine Hubbard) in 2001, a returned Rachel supported him and looked after his young son. The following year, Rachel served as Nick's best man for his wedding to her cousin ‚Äì Waverley. In 2010, 5 years after the high-profile axing of the Harrison family, Bloomfield jokingly suggested bringing back Burnett to the soap if the producers could afford it. =Relationship with Chris= Rachel and \\"Dr Love\\" (Chris Warner (Michael Galvin), the show's longest running character) began a relationship in 2002 which would see the two labelled \\"Shortland Street's golden couple\\" and would continue in a \\"will they, won't they\\" scenario for more than 10 years. Out of all of Chris' love interests, Rachel has been referred to as \\"the love of his life.\\" Bloomfield and Galvin established a friendship throughout working together, with Bloomfield stating, \\"We're like two old people who have known each other forever. We're like a pair of slippers. We're so comfortable in each other's company.\\" The onscreen couple was believed by Bloomfield to be an accurate depiction of a real life couple, \\"I really love ... this. We're speaking a true language and we're telling a story that I think lots of people will look at and be able to relate to.\\" Bloomfield and Galvin were also briefly romantically involved in real life. Rachel was originally the daughter of Chris' boss, Michael McKenna (Paul Gittins); but throughout the nineties the two characters shared very little scenes together. When both characters returned after hiatus' in 2000 and 2001, an onscreen partnership was established between the two. Rachel developed a crush on the doctor, but Galvin was unsure of the potential relationship, \\"Who knows? .... If it did happen, it wouldn't matter that we are friends. Passion for the cameras is all part of the job, and it's definitely not like the real thing.\\" Rachel exposed Chris' fianc√©e Samara (Jodie Rimmer) as a fraud and at first Chris despised her. The two participated in a pantomime play and after the two kissed on stage, Chris decided he too was in love with Rachel. However whilst Rachel accessed her feelings overseas, Chris began to sleep with nurse Toni Thompson (Laura Hill). Upon return Rachel instantly began to date the manic Jack (Manu Bennett). Jack ended up kidnapping Rachel but Chris saved her and the two started a relationship. However, with the birth of Chris' son from his affair with Toni, and Rachel's refusal to be a mother, the relationship started to deteriorate and Rachel turned to the bottle. By late 2002, the relationship was described by Bloomfield as, \\"shaky\\". As Rachel's alcoholism worsened, Chris grew close to Donna (Stephanie Tauevihi), something Bloomfield believed Rachel was ignorant to, \\"Rachel trusts Donna completely ‚Äì and with good reason. She knows that Donna would never do anything to hurt her. What Rachel doesn't realise is that her relationship with Chris is in serious trouble. As she and Chris grow apart, despite their bets intentions, Donna and Chris become closer.\\" As the year came to a close, Chris ended his relationship with the out-of-control Rachel. He got together with Donna and an extremely drunk Rachel tried to ring him while driving, resulting in a near fatal car crash. Rachel fled Ferndale, embarrassed and alone. Bloomfield admitted that though the relationship was over, Rachel was still feeling unrequited love. In 2006, Galvin called for the return of Rachel as the couple had \\"unfinished business\\" and named her as possibly Chris' most suitable match. Rachel returned in 2007 with the same feelings for Chris and the two slept together before she left. Rachel returned in 2009 on business reasons, but it was clear to the audience and to the on-screen characters, that her true plan was to win Chris back. Bloomfield stated, \\"Rachel arrives back in Ferndale on a mission to win back Chris Warner. Chris and her share a lot of history, and she's decided that it's time they get back together once and for all\\" and admitted that Chris was \\"the one that got away\\". Steven Zanoski acknowledged that Rachel was willing to move on after Chris, but stated that there were unresolved feelings between the ex lovers. Rachel knew Chris still had feelings for her, with Bloomfield stating, \\"Rachel is determined to get Chris back and she's willing to go to any length to make it happen. She feels it's only a matter of time become he succumbs ... Rachel can sense Chris feels something for her\\". Peter Mochrie admitted that his character's (Callum McKay) relationship with Rachel was mainly a fill-in for Chris, stating: \\"In the back of his mind, Chris is always going to be the love of Rachel's life and he's trying to put a good spin on that and do as much as he can. Callum's the sort of guy that will cook and bring flowers and do romantic stuff for her. But who knows? I have a sneaking feeling Chris will be back... but we'll see.\\" Zanoski thought it was best Rachel and Chris never got together permanently, but nonetheless, in June 2010 Chris realised he was still in love with Rachel and she too reaccessed her feelings. Bloomfield offered an explanation as to why the two characters keep going back to each other, saying: \\"They are gluttons for punishment. They have a huge history. Chris tried to help Rachel with her alcoholism years ago. They have just always been attracted to each other.\\" The love triangle between Rachel, Chris and Callum saw Bloomfield explain the storyline, stating: \\"She's set herself up with a guy that's great; that offers her a lot of things, that to a lot of women would be wonderful, but he's not the love of her life and she has the love of her life, kinda in the next room.\\" The two finally got together as 2010 ended but whilst Rachel broke it off with Callum, all three got stuck in a devastating explosion. Rachel, Chris and Callum clashed when hospital management came into talks, with Chris suggesting Rachel replace Callum as permanent CEO despite him recovering from serious burns. Rachel declined however, feeling guilty for her treatment of Callum. Moving in with Chris and becoming a surrogate mother to his children, Rachel became the centre of a highly topical storyline when she illegally physically punished Chris' son Harry (Reid Walker). The two's romance became a pivotal point of the 2011 cliffhanger, with the two playing happy families, Rachel was oblivious to the fact Gabrielle Jacobs (Virginie Le Brun) had announced her love to Chris. Gabrielle and Chris started an affair as the year ended. Rachel and Chris broke up but reunited in 2012 for the show's 20th anniversary, however Galvin hinted the worst of their relationship was yet to come, saying; \\"It gets very rocky. And just when you think it's hit rock bottom it gets much, much worse.\\" Chris was arrested for murder but eventually released, and the relationship suffered, with Bloomfield explaining: \\"Rachel feels confused because she naively assumed everything would go back to normal post prison. And even though she knows it can't, it's her way of coping ... It's more about not recognizing Chris because he's changed and that scares her.\\" Following Chris' brain injury in 2013, the couple were at odds following an apparent personality change in Chris, Bloomfield explained, \\"Rachel realises she has to start to get on board with Chris's new way of thinking. But everything he is doing is completely the opposite of what he'd usually do. Rachel finds it really hard to relate to this new Chris ... Rachel thinks it's fine for Chris to let his new ideas loose at home and she needs to accept that.\\" Chris suggested the couple have a baby, but according to Bloomfield, Rachel thought it was, \\"a stupid idea. She can't have children and she doesn't want them. She had a terrible upbringing and isn't prepared to risk raising a child.\\" Instead Chris proposed to Rachel to which she declined, Bloomfield believed the two could work it out, \\"I think love will prevail for the pair of them, but Rachel's still going to be herself. She's not going to change for him. She's making a choice to love him regardless of how's he's changed.\\" However, following a talk from Grace Kwan (Lynette Forday), Rachel herself proposed to Chris, to which he accepted. Only moments later, a bomb rigged by Josh Gallagher (Chris Tempest) under the influence of his hero syndrome, exploded, collapsing the deck underneath the couple and leaving their fate ambiguous as the season ended. The two characters survived the cliffhanger but Galvin noted the road to marriage was going to be \\"problematic\\" as, \\"Rachel's a bit contemptuous of the idea of marriage, but .... Chris is fully into that sentimental idea of getting it put in writing\\". Bloomfield was surprised at the story liners decision to marry Rachel and Chris due to her previous resignation from the show as a result of Rachel's no marriage sentiment, but was told that Rachel would go along with the marriage, \\"to be with him and that means going along with what he wants.\\" Both Galvin and Bloomfield believed the intention of the marriage was to secure a long running relationship on the show and Bloomfield believed if they were to break up, it would be a \\"bad pay-off\\" to fans. The wedding episode aired in February 2014 with Harry serving as Chris' best man and Harper (Ria Vandervis) acting as Rachel's bridesmaid. Bloomfield enjoyed the way Rachel was engaged in the storyline, \\"The whole premise of this storyline is that Rachel has never wanted to be a bride, never needed or wanted to get married. So when she finally concedes, she's the anti-bride. She goes 'I'm not wearing white, I'm not doing this or that.\\" Galvin believed the wedding episode dealt with very little drama as producers wanted one marriage that was, \\"happy\\". Galvin also believed Chris and Rachel's marriage was Chris' most believable, due to he and Bloomfields long lasting friendship. In late 2014 the couple broke up following the revelation Chris knew his baby daughter had not miscarried. Rachel began an affair with Garrett Whitley (Spencer Falls) but Galvin believed Chris was determined to win her back, \\"He has decided that Rachel is the great love of his life and, for that reason he .... is convinced if he just preserves for long enough she will come to her senses and fall into his arms.\\" Bloomfield quit the role in 2016 and producers had to write an exit storyline where Chris would not leave with her whilst not killing her off, so that she could return in the future. Chris began to suspect Rachel was addicted to codeine but Bloomfield believed Chris purposely turned a blind eye, \\"Chris doesn't want to acknowledge his wife has issues. They've been through so much and everything has taken its toll. They haven't acknowledged each other as individuals and gone, 'I really love you, flaws included'.\\" Following her codeine addiction, Rachel relapsed as a result of a manipulative Glenn Rickman (Will Wallace). She was stood down from CEO and drunkenly ruined Lucy's (Grace Palmer) wedding, before deciding to leave Ferndale alone to recover. Galvin believed that Rachel, \\"was what he built his life around and with her gone, he just can't see a future. He's at real crisis point.\\" He thought that Chris was betrayed that \\"Rachel couldn't confide in him.\\" Reception In 2002 Bloomfield was voted \\"Best Actress\\" in the TV Guide Reader's Poll. Rachel has been labelled \\"Shortland Street's sexiest ever women\\" and \\"popular\\". She had also adorned the title, \\"Shortland Street's best-loved bitch\\". By the 20th anniversary of her first appearance in 2013, Rachel had become one of the shows longest running characters. Portraying Rachel reportedly made Angela Bloomfield a household name. The New Zealand Woman's Day magazine listed Rachel as the 3rd best character of the soap's first 25 years. In the mid nineties, Rachel was aged in the same core demographic of the show's primary watching audience. Because of this, Bloomfield found audiences relating well to her, \\"I had too many people ringing me up when I was doing the eating disorders not to become aware of the influence Rachel has ... I'm always getting people saying, \\"I really like your character' and then I stand back and look at them and they really are the epitome of Rachel. Sometimes I find it really sad because they're too scared to develop who they really are.\\" Bloomfield thought the scene where Rachel was hit by lightning was the most enjoyed scene by fans as it was \\"exciting\\". Rachel's return in 2001 was extremely well received, this was due to it occurring at a time when the show was under immense change and many were relieved that a character from the soaps roots was bringing the show to its glory days. The return was described as a \\"good move\\" considering her overwhelming popularity in the nineties. The storyline that saw Jack (Manu Bennett) kidnap Rachel after having a relapse in his bipolar disorder saw huge complaints at the apparent stereotyping of the illness. After crashing her car in the 2002 Christmas cliffhanger, a poll was taken to see what viewers wanted to happen to Rachel. 100% of the voters hoped Rachel would survive and wreak revenge on her cheating boyfriend, Chris Warner. Upon hearing of Rachel's 2009 return, Charlotte Cowan of Entertainment Fix hoped she would provide an adequate returnee on the soap after the disappointing returns of Hone Ropata (Temuera Morrison) and Justine Jones (Lucy Wigmore). Virginie Le Brun (Gabrielle Jacobs) praised Bloomfield's portrayal of Rachel, stating, \\"everything she does is very truthful. I really love the way she works.\\" The departure of Rachel in 2016 alongside several other characters, saw what journalist Duncan Grieve described as a \\"disappointing\\" era of the show, where it entered a style of \\"regularity\\" and lacked \\"long-running and well-acted\\" characters and became a \\"blur\\". The character of Rachel and her story lines have been labelled \\"spectacular\\", and iconic, winning Bloomfield numerous fan awards. The storyline where Rachel got nits was called \\"silly\\" but received acclaim for its coverage of modern-day problems and skill of the writers. It was later named as one of the most iconic storylines to feature on the soap. The 1995 storylines that saw Rachel marry Nick and nearly kill Rangi whilst drunk, were voted by fans as two of the shows most iconic moments. Her catfight with Samara in 2001 has been remembered as a hugely iconic scene. In 2002 she was listed as the 9th best character to ever feature on the soap. In 2007, Rachel was the character fans wanted to return the most in the Throng Shortland Street fan awards. Rachel's 2009 return was praised, winning runner up for \\"Best thing to happen in 2009\\" in the Throng Shortland Street Fan Awards. However, due to the character's antagonistic characterisation, she was voted runner up for \\"Character you'd most like to get rid of\\". Her 2009 return was named as the second best ever character return in the soap, in a 2013 list collated by the Shortland Street website. In 2010 her relationships were criticised, winning runner up for \\"Worst Couple\\" for her relationship with Callum, while her relationship with Chris was also criticised, being labelled \\"boring\\" by one fan. In 2012, the character was named as one of the standout characters of the show's first 20 years. In the Ferndale Talk Best of 2013 awards, Rachel was voted the third favourite character by fans and Bloomfield was voted, \\"Favourite Actress\\". Rachel and Chris were also runner up for \\"Favourite Couple\\", with their decision to have a child together getting runner up for \\"Most Shocking Plot Twist\\". Episodes airing in May 2013 that saw Rachel and Chris break up saw the show receive some of its highest ratings recorded. Rachel's departure in 2016 saw a large response on social media with the actress's Twitter being \\"flooded\\" with messages. Bloomfield found her final storyline \\"depressing\\" but believed it \\"satisfied\\" her acting.

It is set in a not-too-distant future where gasoline prices have become exorbitant ($30+ US/gallon). Things take a turn for the worse when a kindergarten teacher (Mike Brune) invents a car that runs on a different fuel source: blood.Cult Leader: Bucket Seat Of Blood: 'Blood Car' is Cinequest's cult hit, Steve Palopoli, Metroactive, March 7‚Äì13, 2007Cinequest Blood Car, Dennis Harvey, Variety, April 2, 2007 Plot Archie Andrews is a vegan kindergarten teacher who buys products from Lorraine's vegetarian road side stand. He is developing an engine that runs on wheatgrass with no results until he accidentally cuts his finger and the blood falls in the wheatgrass, which filters to the engine and then causes it to run. Andrews then tests his car out and offers a ride to Denise, who runs a meat stand and is a rival to Lorraine. After Denise expresses an interest in Archie (believing he can afford 30+ dollars a gallon gasoline), he drives her home, but runs out of fuel. Archie turns to hunting animals, but they do not provide sufficient blood. He turns to larger prey such as predatory people, and eventually, settles for any victim after rebuilding a more efficient blood engine. The government, which has been tracking Archie's progress, eventually offers him any position he wants, provided he can create more \\"Blood Cars\\" after the original is destroyed, and his existence is erased. Archie is concerned where the fuel for the new cars will come from, and the federal agents promise him it will come from invalids, convicted criminals, and the homeless. Archie agrees. Images of Archie's rise as President are cut with the government agents murdering Lorraine, Denise, his kindergarten students, and anyone that saw him developing the Blood Car.

Set on the Mediterranean, it tells the story of a man who does evil deeds. Although his conscience is awakened and he has fallen in love, escaping his past proves impossible. The English-language film was a co-production between France, Spain and the United States. Plot Demobilised after World War II, Mike Alexander pursues any deals, legal or not, which will make him a fortune. He has acquired a yacht in Mallorca, where he hears of a cargo ship in difficulty, the Chalcis, which is full of refugees. He agrees to take the six richest off the ship, but is sickened by the distress of the rest and tells the captain to put them ashore on an isolated island. He also sees an attractive young woman, Ingrid, who refuses his offer of a free trip to safety. The captain scuttles the ship in a hidden cove and takes Ingrid to Tangier. Shortly after, Ingrid turns up in Mallorca as companion to an eccentric American millionairess, Emily Birk. Again she refuses the advances of Alexander, even when he says his fortune is arriving soon. Mrs Birk tells her she is really a cop and is after Alexander, an evil crook who is expecting a cargo of drugs. Ingrid agrees to go with Alexander to the island where the Chalcis is lying and they are sickened to find all the refugees locked in the hold by the captain and dead. When Alexander's drugs arrive, concealed in a schooner, they are lifted by Mrs Birk, who is not a cop but a dealer, and hidden in the wreck of the Chalcis. Alexander finds this out and, his cover blown, destroys the consignment. To escape the law, he then heads in his yacht for Tangier and Ingrid agrees to flee with him. In an ending that was in accord with the Motion Picture Production Code, police launches pursue them and shoot Alexander dead.

The thinner branches sometimes have similar rough bark or smooth white or grey bark that is shed in short ribbons. The leaves on young plants are arranged in opposite pairs, broadly egg-shaped to heart-shaped or almost round, dull, dark green with a lighter shade on the lower side and lack a stalk. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The two sides of the leaf are a different shade of green. The flowers are arranged in groups of seven, the groups on a slightly flattened peduncle long, the individual flowers on a pedicel long. The mature flower buds are oval, long and wide, green to yellow with a conical or beaked operculum. Flowering occurs between January and March and the fruit is a woody, hemispherical or conical capsule long and wide on a pedicel long with four upward-pointing valves on the top of the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus angophoroides was first formally described in 1901 by Richard Thomas Baker who published the description in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. The tree has the appearance of an \\"apple tree\\" (Angophora) and had previously been known as \\"apple-top box\\" and was accordingly given the specific epithet angophoroides. Distribution and habitat Apple-top box grows in valleys and on hillsides, often near the edge of swamps, and in open forest and wet forest, usually in fertile soils. It is found in New South Wales south from Towrang to the northern foothills of the Strzelecki Ranges south of Trafalgar, Victoria.

It includes a subplot about Chen Zhen, a fictional apprentice of Huo Yuanjia and the protagonist of the 1972 film Fist of Fury. The series was directed by Jia Yun and starred Vincent Zhao, Wu Yue, Mei Ting, Qi Yan, and He Yin in the lead roles. A sequel, Jingwu Yingxiong Chen Zhen, was released later in the same year. Plot In the late Qing dynasty, China suffers humiliating defeats in battles against foreign powers such as Britain and Japan, and is forced to sign unequal treaties and cede territories to foreigners. In Tianjin, even though Huo Endi defeats his Japanese opponent in a leitai match, his triumph is a Pyrrhic victory because China had just been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War and its Beiyang Fleet was completely destroyed. Huo Yuanjia, Huo Endi's son, travels to Beijing to meet his father's friend \\"Great Sword\\" Wang Wu. He is drawn into the affairs of the Hundred Days' Reform unknowingly. Wang is a supporter of the reformists and he attempts to rescue the \\"Six Gentlemen\\", who have been imprisoned on Empress Dowager Cixi's order. Huo joins Wang in his quest but they fail and the six men are executed in public, while Wang dies a gruesome death later when he tries to avenge his comrades. Through his experiences, Huo Yuanjia begins to see the declining state of China and realises that China needs to change in order to survive in the future. Huo meets members of the Tongmenghui, a secret society planning to overthrow the corrupt Qing regime and establish a republic in China, and he supports them in their efforts. Huo Yuanjia travels to Shanghai later, where he founds Jingwu School to groom martial artists to defend China from foreign intrusion and to boost national morale. Huo makes his name by defeating an aggressive Russian wrestler in Tianjin and an overbearing British boxer in Shanghai, upholding the dignity of the Chinese. At the same time, he meets the hostile Chen Zhen, who seeks vengeance on him. Chen's father was killed by Huo Endi years ago and since Huo Endi had died, Huo Yuanjia becomes Chen's target. Huo Yuanjia accepts Chen as his apprentice and attempts to resolve their feud by enlightening Chen with his martial arts philosophy. Huo Yuanjia's love relationships are also in a mess, because he is in love with both Qiyun and Nong Jingqiu, but both of them stand on opposing grounds: Qiyun is the daughter of Prince Rong, a Manchu noble and the primary enemy of the Tongmenghui; Nong Jingqiu is the sister of Nong Jinsun, a Tongmenghui member. Besides that, Huo faces love rivals: Watanabe Ichiro, a prominent Japanese consul, is in love with Qiyun; Zheng Yefeng, Nong Jingqiu's godbrother, has a crush on his godsister.

The scape is up to 1‚Äì2 feet (30‚Äì60 cm) tall with tufts of leaves, which are thick, hard, and rounded on the back. The leaves die back as the umbel of pink to purple flowers forms in early August.

Early years Maritz was born in Kimberley, Northern Cape then in the British colony of the Cape of Good Hope, and as such, was a British subject. He was christened Salomon Gerhardus Maritz. When he turned 19 he went to Johannesburg and was employed as a cab driver by his uncle. During the Jameson Raid he volunteered as a guard of the Johannesburg fort. This entitled him to become a citizen of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (ZAR). This, in turn, permitted him to join the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek Politie (ZARP), the police force in Johannesburg.Maritz, Manie, My lewe en strewe, published by the author in 1939. Second Boer War Maritz joined the Boksburg commando and proceeded to the Natal front. Later he joined Daniel Theron's crack reconnaissance corps and then participated in the invasion of the Cape Colony. He eventually landed up in the desert-like terrain of the North-western Cape. Maritz claims that Jan Smuts appointed him as a veggeneraal ('fighting- general'). At that time Deneys Reitz was on the staff of General Jan Smuts. Reitz writes that Maritz was only a \\"leader of various rebel bands\\".Reitz, Deneys, Commando:A Boer journal of the Boer War, Albion Press, 2015, Kindle Edition, locations 3916 - 3921. If Smuts had appointed Maritz as a fighting general, Reitz would have known about it. Near the end of the war Maritz ordered the killing of 35 Coloured (Khoikhoi) in what became known as the Leliefontein massacre. Gideon Scheepers and Breaker Morant were court- martialled and shot for similar crimes. When peace was made, the burghers of the erstwhile republics were obliged to lay down their arms and sign an oath of allegiance to the British monarch. Instead Maritz slipped over the border to German South West Africa. In his autobiography Maritz does not say why he did so. Inter war years He went to Europe and then to Madagascar and back to Europe.Deneys Reitz, Trekking On, Kindle edition, 2016, locations 360 and 602. He returned to South Africa, where he farmed horses in the Cape and also helped the Germans during the Herero and Namaqua genocide. When he returned he went to the Transvaal, but was arrested for entering the colony, not having signed the oath of allegiance. He departed for the Cape. When the Free State received responsible government, he went there and later joined the police in the Transvaal. First World War In 1913 Maritz was offered a commission in the Active Citizen Force of the Union Defence Force He accepted and, after attending a training course, he was appointed to command the military area abutting German South-West Africa. In August 1914 he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. There is evidence that he started colluded with the Germans at a very early stage. As early as the autumn of 1913 (in the southern hemisphere) he had contact with the German governor in the neighbouring country.Britz, Jurgens Johannes, Genl S G (Manie) Maritz se aandeel aan die rebellie van 1914 ‚Äì 1915, unpublished M.A. dissertation University of Pretoria, 1979. On 23 September 1914 Maritz was ordered to advance in the direction of the German border, to support the Union's invasion in the vicinity of Sandfontein, where a portion of Lieutenant-Colonel Lukin's force was stranded. He refused to do so. Then he was ordered to relinquish command to another officer and return to Pretoria, but again refused to do so. On 9 October he eventually decided to rebel. The next day he occupied the town of Keimoes. Then on 22 October he was wounded in a skirmish with government troops and he was taken to German South-West Africa. Some people have named the rebellion after him. See Maritz Rebellion Later life When he returned to South Africa in 1923 he was arrested and charged with high treason. He was convicted and sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment. When General Hertzog's National Party won the 1924 election, they released Maritz after only serving 3 months. During the 1930s, Maritz became a Nazi sympathiser and was known as an outspoken proponent of the Third Reich. In 1939 he published his autobiography called My Lewe en Strewe (My life and aspiration). Britz points out that the book was written many years after the events, lacks objectivity and has a strong emotional flavour. The anti-Semitic statements in his book resulted in his prosecution for fomenting racial hatred. He was fined ¬£75. Death He died in Pretoria on 19 December 1940 and is buried in the Pretoria West Cemetery.eGGSA Library website In popular culture The character General Manie Roosa, in James Rollins and Grant Blackwood's novel The Kill Switch (2014), is \\"very loosely based on the real-life Boer leader Manie Maritz. Maritz is referred to many times in John Buchan's Greenmantle (1916) in which the heroes, who are British spies, masquerade as veterans of Maritz's rebellion in order to infiltrate among German strategists.

GameCrush members (the site focuses on female players, due to their relative scarcity in console online gaming) can post profiles with pictures, videos and gaming information and interact with other members through text chat, video chat and private messages. The site launched publicly on September 28, 2010, the same day it presented as a finalist at San Francisco's TechCrunch Disrupt Design GameCrush differentiated itself from other social gaming sites by offering credits, which could be used to buy and give gifts that held real world value. While messaging and requesting a game were free, it was considered a nice gesture to offer a gift when requesting a game from someone new (as co-founder Eric Strasser put it, \\"much like buying a drink for someone in a bar\\"). Members could also earn badges and achievements, and could be rated, or even blocked, by other members based on their behavior. History Shortly after first launching their beta in March 2010 the GameCrush site went down. According to statements made by its management, it was overloaded with more connections than it could handle,due to the high demand. It is reported that management said they were \\"overwhelmed with interest, and have smoking servers to prove it.\\" It was claimed that the site received over 10,000 queries in five minutes of operation, overloading their servers and crashing their network. On June 5, 2010, GameCrush returned as a private, invitation-only beta. BusinessWeek wrote an article describing GameCrush as \\"part social network, part online dating site, and a lot of Grand Theft Auto.\\"http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_28/b4186072409005.htm The same article revealed the founders to be Eric Strasser, David Good, and Anees Iqbal. Strasser revealed that the site had more than 5,000 women and 1,000 men participating in its private beta. In August 2010, TechCrunch's Michael Arrington revealed that GameCrush had raised $700,000 in an angel round featuring Scott Banister and his wife Cyan, among other angels and VCs. The public launch was loosely scheduled a month out from the article, September 2010. On September 28, 2010, GameCrush launched its public site and presented as one of the six finalist companies at TechCrunch Disrupt. In early 2011, GameCrush launched a free, random game matching engine called the \\"Crush-O-Matic.\\" TechCrunch described the service as one that mined a vein similar to the video experience of Chatroulette but with cofounder Eric Strasser stating that \\"the site‚Äôs registration requirement, user profiles and a user rating system help prevent\\" the rampant nudity found on that site. After experimenting with various compensation models for the PlayDates, the site shut down in early 2013. In its place was a promotion for an upcoming site called \\"Buckme\\" that never appears to have launched. Reception The Boston Phoenix's \\"Laser Orgy\\" online column, written by Maddy Myers, said \\"I'm as mystified by this service as I am by similar services offered by girls (or guys -- but usually girls) who sit around talking to people on their webcams.\\" she also commented \\"There's something inherently sexual about GameCrush, yes -- but that's mostly due to the over-sexualizing of women in both American society and particularly in gamer culture...\\" and \\"So, GameCrush, I give you props for your stupid idea. I am dubious about how successful it'll be, though, when the percentage of female gamers climbs every day.\\" IGNs \\"Xbox Live\\" online column, written by Daemon Hatfield, said \\"I can imagine some guys might be disappointed if they paid to play with a girl, only to hear her go on and on about her boyfriend...\\" and \\"Perhaps the most surprising thing about GameCrush is that no one else thought of it sooner. I have no doubt there are many gamers out there who would be willing to pay a little cash to play and flirt with hot girls, the only question is whether or not GameCrush is offering the right features for the right price.\\" VentureBeat's \\"GamesBeat\\" online column, written by Dean Takahashi, said \\"But a hot girl who can beat you at a game of Halo is probably a close to an ideal date for a lot of gamer dudes. At least that‚Äôs my guess.\\" Cnet's online column \\"Crave\\", written by Matt Hickey, said: \\"Still, the idea could work if gaming girls--I'm sorry, PlayDates--can get around the slightly creepy idea of selling themselves for the attention of boys. Like Alicia, I'm a little skeeved out by the whole thing.\\" PC World's online column \\"Today@PCWorld\\", written by Sarah Jacobsson, said: \\"Isn't it great to know that playing video games and chatting with hot girls aren't mutually exclusive activities any more (assuming you have the cash to spend)?\\" Tom's Guide, article written by Kevin Parrish, mentioned that concerns about the \\"Play Dates\\" were raised by reporters with the site's PR firm. \\"It was noted that their extracurricular activities were not directly connected to the dating service, however it's unavoidable to turn a blind eye to their other 'hobbies.' As an example, JadeRox works elsewhere online as an amateur pornographer, and even has a website that shows off her naked, feminine qualities. Needless to say, she's not sporting any manly luggage. She's even selling her used panties.\\" He concluded \\"Maybe lonely gamers should put down the gamepad and head to a local club with friends.\\" Fast Company, article written by Dan Nosowitz, said \\"Here's how pathetic GameCrush is: it modeled its service after the behavior of a desperate man trying to get a girl's attention at a bar by buying her an eight-dollar drink. But in reality, it's more of a gamer's phone sex line, dressed in Ed Hardy.\\" The Escapist, article written by Greg Tito, notes that during the testing period: \\"Internet comedians have already created false profiles such as Gabe Newell, a bear and a grill. Get it? A gamer grill! Genius!\\" XboxIC, article written by Jason Andrews, warned that use of GameCrush might violate Microsoft's Terms of Service (ToS) for Xbox Live, and that Microsoft logs all Xbox Live sessions. \\"If you don‚Äôt want the Xbox LIVE Enforcement team to laugh at your penis as they bring down the banhammer, or to have to call Customer Support because the woman who sent you dirty texts stole your Xbox LIVE account - then think wisely!\\" Andrews wrote. The ToS states that users may not, among other things: \\"use the Service for commercial purposes\\", \\"use the Service in a way that harms us or our advertisers, affiliates, resellers, distributors, or vendors, or any customer of ours or our advertisers, affiliates, resellers, distributors, or vendors\\", or \\"Publish, distribute, or disseminate any inappropriate, profane, defamatory, infringing, obscene, indecent, or unlawful content, topic, name, material, file, or information\\". Andrews also notes that GameCrush's rate is almost $40 per hour. Crush! Frag! Destroy!, article written by Rob Rich, said, \\"I will say that I‚Äôm pretty put-off by this whole thing. Especially the fact that IGN seems to condone it. But maybe I‚Äôm just being an alarmist. I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later, right?\\" Games Abyss, article written by Brad Hilderbrand, said, \\"The website is set up like the world's loneliest singles lobby, allowing players to pick their game as well as whether they want their pretend date to be \\"flirty,\\" \\"dirty,\\" or both. You then pay around $10 for a ten minute game and feel much worse about yourself afterwards.\\" The Huffington Post article written by Jessica Rovello, said \\"Let's not mistake what this is. It's not gaming, it's simply a new spin on the phone sex lines of the 80s. It's light porn with a twist. If it wasn't, you wouldn't need to be over 18 to join, you wouldn't be able to have uncensored \\"Dirty\\" talk over webcams and you wouldn't be able to tip your PlayDate real cash after your session. If there's anything revolutionary about GameCrush it's that it took this long for someone to come up with the idea of actually paying women to play core games like Modern Warfare 2. After all the hardcore game community has never valued women for anything more than their avatars. It shuts them out of their ranks on the corporate side, hyper- sexualizes them in games and then wonders why they have a hard time attracting more female players.\\" Writing in Binge Game, James Walker wrote: \\"Does it sound shady? Sure. Is it sleazy to pay women to chat with you over a game of Gears of War? To a degree, you bet. But if there is one thing that gamers know how to do, it‚Äôs waste exorbenant [sic] amounts of money on pointless shit.\\" References External links * Category:Video game websites ","title":"GameCrush"},{"id":"26680255","text":"Empire Charmian was a heavy lift ship which was built in 1943 by Vickers-Armstrongs, Barrow in Furness. She was built for the Ministry of War Transport (MoWT). In 1951 she was sold into merchant service and renamed Vercharmian. After running aground in 1961, she was scrapped in 1962. Description The ship was built by Vickers Armstrongs, Barrow-in-Furness. She was launched on 25 November 1942 and completed in March 1943. The ship was long, with a beam of and a depth of . She had a GRT of 7,513 and a NRT of 5,133. The ship was propelled by a 2-stroke Single Cycle Single Action diesel engine, which had three cylinders of bore by diameter. The engine was built by William Doxford & Sons Ltd. Sunderland. History Empire Charmian was built for the MoWT. She was placed under the management of the British-India Steam Navigation Co Ltd. Her port of registry was Barrow in Furness. The Code Letters BFDL and United Kingdom Official Number 167745 were allocated. Empire Charmian was a member of a number of convoys during the Second World War. ;MKS 19 Convoy MKS 19 departed Tripoli, Libya on 21 July 1943 and arrived at Gibraltar on 28 July. Empire Charmian joined the convoy at Algiers, Algeria on 24 July. Records are unclear as to the eventual destination of the convoy. One source states that it arrived at the Clyde on 9 August. Empire Charmian was not listed in that part of the convoy. ;MKS 23 Convoy MKS 23 departed Alexandria, Egypt on 25 August 1943 and arrived at the Clyde on 14 September. Empire Charmian joined the convoy at Malta and left it at Bizerta, Tunisia. In 1945, Empire Charmian transported a number of TIDs to Hong Kong. In February 1945, she transported TID 124 from the United Kingdom to Hong Kong. In October 1945, she transported TID 122 from Singapore to Hong Kong, and TIDs 123, 129 and 130 from Manus Island, Admiralty Islands to Hong Kong. In 1946, management of Empire Charmian was transferred to the Hain Steamship Co Ltd. In 1951, Empire Charmian was sold to Vergottis Ltd, London and renamed Vercharmian. On 26 July 1960, crewmember Fernando Davila was injured when he fell through an open hatch on the forecastle of Vercharmian. He sued in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit claiming damages for injuries suffered when he fell through the hatch. The claim was denied and an appeal was unsuccessful. On 31 May 1961, Vercharmian ran aground off Mormugao, India. She was refloated, and sailed on 7 July but was discovered to be leaking and was beached in Mormugao Bay.

It is part of the northern section of the Ludwig South-North Railway. It runs along the Regnitz Valley and is one of the important German transport routes. The line has become important for long-distance services since German reunification and this has increased since the opening of the Nuremberg‚ÄìErfurt high-speed line in 2017. As part of German Unity Transport Project No. 8 (Verkehrsprojekts Deutsche Einheit Nr. 8), it is being upgraded as an extension of the new line between Ebensfeld and Erfurt. History  One of Germany's oldest locomotive sheds (the section on the right, built with the line to W√ºrzburg in 1862/65) is located on the line in F√ºrth and closed. After the Bavarian parliament had passed a bill for the construction of the Ludwig South‚ÄìNorth Railway on 25 August 1843, work began on the line later in the year. The Royal Commission on Railway Construction of Nuremberg was responsible for the acquisition of land and its routing. The line was opened on 1 September 1844. The original route between Nuremberg and Erlangen, parallel to the Ludwig-Danube-Main Canal and east of F√ºrth was changed between 1862 and 1876 with the construction of the line to W√ºrzburg and the so-called Furth arc. Until that time, the Ludwig South‚ÄìNorth line the crossed the Ludwig Railway at the border of Nuremberg and F√ºrth. Like all lines built in Bavaria at that time, the line was originally built as a single-track line. It was duplicated between 1862 and 1892 in four stages. Electrification of the line was completed on 10 May 1939. During trial runs, passenger trains between Bamberg and Forchheim reached a speed of 200 km/h for the first time in Germany. These trials took place in 1963 and 1964 between Forchheim and Bamberg under automatic train control. =Opening dates = *1 September 1844: Nuremberg‚ÄìF√ºrth Kreuzung‚ÄìGro√ügr√ºndlach‚ÄìBamberg *1 October 1862: F√ºrth Kreuzung‚ÄìF√ºrth station *1 August 1876: F√ºrth station‚ÄìGro√ügr√ºndlach Route  Regional-Express on the Siebenbogenbr√ºcke in F√ºrth. The route leaves the N√ºrnberg Hauptbahnhof together with the routes to Wurzburg, to Augsburg and to Crailsheim in the west, with the latter two branching off to the south or southwest, and the line to Bamberg and Wurzburg turning to the northwest and running parallel to the Frankenschnellweg (A73. It runs south of the suburbs of Gostenhof and Eberhardshof and the container terminal and the Nuremberg West depot, through the Rothenburger Strasse station and then crosses the border between Nuremberg and F√ºrth and the Frankenschnellweg and finally reaches F√ºrth Hauptbahnhof. After the station, the line to Wurzburg forks off to the west and the Rangau Railway to the south. The route then crosses the Rednitz river on the Siebenbogenbr√ºcke (Seven arch bridge) and turns in a long curve to the north and crosses the river now called the Regnitz south of Stadeln. Then, the route curves to the left between Stadeln and Herboldshof to Vach station, then passes to the east side of the Frankenschnellweg and continues to Eltersdorf and Erlangen. Before the line passes through Erlangen-Bruck station there is a junction with a branch line that used to go to Herzogenaurach, notable for the manufacture of sports shoes. After Erlangen station the line passes through the 306-metre Burgberg Tunnel and continues parallel to the Frankenschnellweg through Bubenreuth, Baiersdorf and Kersbach to Forchheim. At Forchheim station, a line branches off to Ebermannstadt (connecting to a steam railway operated by Dampfbahn Fr√§nkische Schweiz) but another branch to H√∂chstadt closed in 2005. Next, the line then crosses the Frankenschnellweg again and runs between it on the right and the Rhine‚ÄìMain‚ÄìDanube Canal on the left through Eggolsheim, Buttenheim and Hirschaid to Strullendorf station, where the line to Schl√ºsselfeld branches off. After the line crosses the Bundesstra√üe 505 it touches the southern foothills of the Hauptsmoorer national forest before running into Bamberg station. =Line standards= The line is double-tracked and electrified along its entire length. In addition to GSM-R radio on the whole line, the section between Nuremberg Hauptbahnhof (km 0) and Bubenreuth (km 28) is equipped for active tilting technology. =Transport network= The entire Nuremberg-Bamberg route is integrated as Regionalbahn service R2 and S-Bahn service S1 of the Nuremberg S-Bahn in the transport network of Greater Nuremberg. Long-distance passenger traffic consists of hourly Intercity- Express services on the Munich ‚Äì Nuremberg ‚Äì Leipzig ‚Äì Berlin (‚Äì Hamburg) route. ICE T and occasional ICE 1 sets are used. One pair of ICE services each day is replaced by an Intercity service with the same travel times. In regional transport, the line served hourly by several Regional-Express and Nuremberg S-Bahn services (as of December 2014). Specifically, these are: * RE Nuremberg‚ÄìBamberg‚ÄìSchweinfurt‚ÄìW√ºrzburg with a second portion separating at Bamberg and continuing to Sonneberg * RE Nuremberg‚ÄìBamberg‚ÄìLichtenfels‚ÄìCoburg‚ÄìSonneberg with a second portion (uncoupled in Lichtenfels) to Jena via Kronach and Saalfeld * RE Nuremberg‚ÄìBamberg /‚ÄìLichtenfels /‚ÄìSonneberg as individual reinforcement services on weekdays during the peak (usually operated with a set of class 442.1) * S1 Hersbruck (left Pegnitz)/Lauf‚ÄìNuremberg‚ÄìF√ºrth‚ÄìErlangen‚ÄìForchheim * S1 Hartmannshof‚ÄìNuremberg‚ÄìF√ºrth‚ÄìErlangen‚ÄìForchheim‚ÄìBamberg The two Regional- Express services operate every two hours, together producing an hourly service. The S-Bahn offers an hourly service from Nuremberg to Bamberg and two services an hour to/from Forchheim (at alternating 20 or 40 minute intervals). All DB Regio Regionalbahn services on the line have been replaced by the S-Bahn. But since mid-2011, there have been some agilis Regionalbahn services on the section from Bamberg to Forchheim that continue to Ebermannstadt. Since the introduction of the S-Bahn, RE services no longer stop in Baiersdorf. DB regional services, except for a few peak-hour reinforcement services, are operated by Bombardier Talent 2 (class 442) sets. The S-Bahn services on line S1 of the Nuremberg S-Bahn are also operated with Talent 2 sets. These are formed at the edges of the day and at weekends partly of single four-car sets and otherwise with two coupled sets. Agilis is operated with Stadler Regio- Shuttle RS1 (class 650) sets. After the calling of tenders by the Bayerische Eisenbahngesellschaft, there was a change in Regional-Express services. An hourly RE service is operated to Sonneberg Hauptbahnhof. This involves the operation of coupled Talent 2 sets that are alternately coupled or uncoupled in Bamberg or Lichtenfels. The trains that do not run to Sonneberg, run every two hours to W√ºrzburg Hauptbahnhof or Jena Saale station and then return to Nuremberg, with the sets coupled at Bamberg or Lichtenfels. The services operate between N√ºrnberg and Jena/Sonneberg as the Franken-Th√ºringen-Express. Future  =Upgrading to four tracks between Nuremberg and F√ºrth = A groundbreaking ceremony was held on 10 August 2006 at the Rothenburger Stra√üe railway overpass to begin the building of two extra tracks on the 7.7 kilometre-long section between Nuremberg and F√ºrth to provide four tracks. This was built as part of the Nuremberg‚ÄìErfurt high-speed railway project and the 38 kilometre-long Nuremberg S-Bahn line to Forchheim. Funding of ‚Ç¨170 million was allocated for the section. Commissioning was originally due to take place in December 2010. In February 2008, the planned costs were stated to be ‚Ç¨162 million. Construction began in March 2008 to widen the embankment for 1.75 km between Nuremberg and F√ºrth so that two additional tracks could be built south of the existing line. A total of 22.3 kilometres of track and eight bridges were reconstructed or replaced. New platform were built at Hauptbahnhof F√ºrth and N√ºrnberg-Steinb√ºhl station and N√ºrnberg Rothenburger Str. station was adapted for the S-Bahn. The western end of Nuremberg station and the eastern end of the F√ºrth freight yard were also rebuilt. An electronic interlocking was installed at Furth station. Its first construction phase went into operations on 14 September 2009. Since December 2011, the interlocking has partially controlled F√ºrth station and completely controls the section between Nuremberg and F√ºrth with a total of 87 main signals and 94 axle counters. A third track has been available between Nuremberg and F√ºrth for the S-Bahn since 18 December 2010. All four tracks have been in use since 21 November 2011. The northernmost track is used by the S-Bahn in both directions, one track is used for regional traffic and two tracks are used for long-distance traffic. Subsequently, the S-Bahn platform at F√ºrth Hauptbahnhof was also finished. The S-Bahn halt of N√ºrnberg-Steinb√ºhl was not then operational, but it was completed in late 2012. = Nuremberg‚ÄìForchheim S-Bahn extension = The whole line from Nuremberg to Bamberg is being upgraded to four tracks. Construction work on the \\"Furth arc\\" (F√ºrther Bogen) near Hauptbahnhof F√ºrth began in 2008. The line is under construction between F√ºrth Hbf and the bridge over the Regnitz in F√ºrth. Two new tracks are being laid for the S-Bahn. For this purpose, another bridge had to be built next to the Siebenbogen (seven arch) Bridge in F√ºrth. During this work the course of the original tracks was moved to the west. This was completed by the end of 2010. The construction of the S-Bahn tracks has begun in this area, but has remained unfinished with hardly any construction activity going on after 2012 (as of April 2014). After the planned completion of the work in December 2016, the halt of F√ºrth-Unterfarrnbach was to be renamed F√ºrth-Klinikum. No further work has been done north of this section of the line as far as the municipal boundary of Erlangen. The route was disputed between the city of F√ºrth and Deutsche Bahn, but the Federal Railway Authority (Eisenbahn-Bundesamt) approved the plan on 30 January 2014. The city of F√ºrth appealed to the Federal Administrative Court against this planning approval in April 2014. According to the Bavarian Ministry of Transport in December 2010, the planned new S-Bahn route, which would run via Schmalau (the so-called F√ºrther Verschwenk, F√ºrth pivot), would have a benefit-cost ratio of 1.18. By contrast, the two routes along the existing line favoured by the city of F√ºrth are not economically viable and thus ineligible for funding. The Federal Administrative Court announced on 16 October 2014 an urgent application by the city of F√ºrth, an environmental association and several private property owners against the immediate enforceability of the planning approval on this section of the S-Bahn for the line to be built through the districts of Steinach (city of F√ºrth) and Schmalau (city of Nuremberg) away from and to the east of the existing line. The Federal Administrative Court ordered a suspension of work, because the interest of considering the legal objections of the applicants and the public interest outweighed the interest of DB Netz AG in the immediate completion of the plan as approved. In the middle of 2016, a decision of the Federal Administrative Court was expected to be delivered in the autumn of 2016. DB announced in 2017 that a positive decision of the court would allow the construction of the line by 2021. The Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig declared the S-Bahn pivot to the north of F√ºrth to be unlawful and not enforceable on 9 November 2017. On 8 April 2015, the state and DB signed a planning agreement to connect the three-kilometre section temporally with points from 2019. Their installation and upgrade is expected to cost ‚Ç¨2 million each. The planning agreement is partly a financial agreement. The commissioning of the work is not possible until 2019 at the earliest and the estimated cost of the points, including their later dismantling, would be ‚Ç¨10.4 million instead of the previously estimated ‚Ç¨2.6 million. Work began in 2011 on the upgrading of the line in the urban area of Erlangen and to the north of Baiersdorf. The Paul-Gossen-Stra√üe S-Bahn halt in Erlangen was opened in December 2015 and one year later the Unterfarrnbach/F√ºrth Klinikum station followed. The upgrade between Eltersdorf and Erlangen was to be completed along with the F√ºrth arc, including the Stadeln and Steinach stations, by the end of 2016. At the end of 2017, the upgrade between Erlangen and Baiersdorf was to be completed by the end of 2018. This would allow the operation of services at 20-minute intervals in peak hour. The upgrade of the Bamberg junction would not start before 2020 according to a presentation of DB Netz (as of mid 2014). A report commissioned by the town of Bamberg questioned Deutsche Bahn upgrade plans. Freight traffic could be handled on the existing tracks in 2030. The next section to Bamberg would be completed by 2024 and the completion of work in Bamberg is conceivable at the earliest in 2028 (as of 2017). The establishment of a halt at Forchheim Nord is being considered. A planning agreement was concluded in January 2016. The halt would be built as long as no cost increase occurs. The design speed for S-Bahn services is 140 km/h. = Nuremberg‚ÄìEbensfeld upgraded line= The upgraded section forms the southern section of subproject VDE 8.1 The line between Nuremberg and Ebensfeld is being upgraded for speeds up to 230 km/h, further reducing the travel time from Munich to Berlin, which has been significantly reduced by the construction of the Nuremberg‚ÄìMunich high- speed railway. To relieve F√ºrth junction, where the freight traffic of the Nuremberg marshalling yard‚ÄìF√ºrth‚ÄìBamberg route crosses the passenger routes between Nuremberg and Bamberg and Nuremberg and W√ºrzburg, funding of ‚Ç¨20 million has been provided for the modernisation and electrification of the connection between the marshalling yard and the main goods yard. Furthermore, an approximately 13 kilometre-long freight bypass line will be built in a tunnel below the Nuremberg and F√ºrth urban area by 2021. (brochure on the website of VDE Nr. 8.1 Neu- und Ausbaustrecke N√ºrnberg‚ÄìErfurt project) During a blockade of the Bamberg‚ÄìForchheim section from 1 August to 14 September 2009, the stations of Buttenheim and Strullendorf were rebuilt for the S-Bahn and connected to the new tracks between Nuremberg and F√ºrth.

Currently he is founding President of The Big EQ Campaign, a non-profit organization that has undertaken a mass marketing campaign called EQuip Our Kids! to mobilize the public to mandate that social and emotional learning (SEL) skills be included in every schools curriculum. He is also chair of the California Social-Emotional Learning Alliance, an assemblage of educators and education and grassroots organizations that advocates for universal statewide SEL from pre-school through high school. Early life Jay Levin was born in New York, the son of a tool-and-die maker. =Career= Jay Levin is best known as the founder of the LA Weekly, of which he was editor-in-chief and president for many years before selling what he had grown to be the largest and most successful city weekly in the country. Levin put together an investment group that included actor Michael Douglas, Burt Kleiner, Joe Benadon and Pete Kameron. The publication's first issue featured a group of female comedians, including the then-little known Sandra Bernhard, on its cover. Subsequent issues featured expos√©s on the Los Angeles basin's air quality and U.S. interventionism in Central America. The LA Weekly was also notable for its coverage of independent cinema and the Los Angeles music scene. Levin retained many of the writers he had earlier brought to the Los AngelesFree Press and hired Joie Davidow to edit the arts and entertainment section. Davidow produced a comprehensive calendar section and explored undiscovered fashion districts, discovering new designers. In 1985, the LA Weekly launched a glossy magazine, L.A. Style, which Davidow edited. L.A. Style was sold to American Express Publishing Co. in 1988 and merged with Buzz magazine in 1993.Nancy Yoshihara, \\"Chic L.A. Style Magazine Sold to American Express,\\" Los Angeles Times May 11, 1988. By 1990, the LA Weekly achieved a circulation of 165,000, making it the largest urban weekly in the US. Post-LA Weekly Levin stepped down as president of the LA Weekly in 1992 in order to found a progressive cable TV network and was succeeded by Michael Sigman as publisher and Kit Rachlis as editor. The newspaper was sold to Stern Publishing, owner of the Village Voice, in 1994; in October 2005, it was sold to the Phoenix, Arizona-based Village Voice Media. In September 2012, it was transferred to the Denver-based Voice Media Group in a management buyout. \\"LA Weekly, OC Weekly being sold to Voice Media\\" \\"L.A. Biz\\", September 24, 2012. Levin founded the start-up progressive channel, Planet Central TV, and later a website and magazine called Real Talk L.A. Recent career For the last 20 years Levin has split his time between starting, growing or turning around media properties such as TheFix.com; and on life coaching focused on teaching life mastery and helping people reorient their lives, careers and relationships without spending years in therapy. Most recently he has been working with 15 to 20 CEOs on becoming socially conscious and effective managers while helping them elevate the bottom-line performance of their businesses and grow their companies. Based on his knowledge of the positive effects of Life skills training, Levin early in 2016 launched The Big EQ Campaign to galvanize the public around schools including daily curriculum education for students and staff in emotional management and in relationship and co-creativity social skills ‚Äì to the profound benefit of children, teens, adults, the schools themselves, and society and business (the economy) as a whole. When training in EQ development is combined with training in the skills to relate empathically to and communicate well with others, and to make cogent decisions, the familiar term used in academic circles for such overall life skills training is ‚ÄúSocial and Emotional Learning,‚Äù known as SEL. The Campaign argues that evidence shows that SEL skills and capacities can have a remarkable positive effect on a person's life, ability to learn, and long-term success. So much so that SEL (which includes EQ development) has the potential to elevate society as a whole - in the form of better relationships all around, less conflict, and more productive and healthier individuals, workplaces, institutions and communities. SEL training tends to dissipate violence, racism, hard drug usage and other forms of anti-social mindsets and behaviors while improving academic and life-long success and lowering criminal justice, mental and physical health and other social costs. Over the years Levin has worked with hundreds of individuals one-on-one. Encouraged by clients, he also began offering courses to hundreds of people in Life Elevation, relationships and leadership. Highly successful in terms of reorienting people's lives, careers and inner and outer relations for the better, the courses (like his personal coaching) allow individuals to learn systems they can use to benefit themselves - in effect, participants, including CEOS, learn to become their own coaches. Along with gaining mastery of inner emotional and mental demons, participants gain a sophisticated and necessary education in the realities of human inter-reaction and selfhood that the culture fails to provide en masse. Participants report learning tools that give them more confidence in nearly every situation and which make them better able to cope when challenged.http://www.jaylevin.com References External links * Jay Levin official website * Category:Living people Category:American male journalists Category:Jewish American journalists Category:1943 births Category:American chief executives in the media industry ","title":"Jay Levin"},{"id":"26680437","text":"The Tulane Medical Center is a hospital located in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Boustead was born in Yorkshire, England. He was the great-grandfather of actor David Niven. Beginnings of Boustead & Co In 1828, Boustead arrived in Singapore on board the British ship Hindustan. In the same year, he established a trading company, Boustead & Co.Chew, Melanie (2008). \\"Boustead 1828\\", pp. 6 ‚Äì 7. Boustead & Co specialised in import and export, offering goods such as banca tin, spices, saps, rattan, medicinal herbs, silk and tea widely available in South East Asia in exchange for Western products like cloth, oil and machinery. Boustead commissioned Irish civil architect, George Drumgoole Coleman to design his company's headquarters alongside the Singapore River. The warehouse was known as \\"the house of seven and twenty pillars\\", located around the corner from High Street. In 1834, Boustead partnered with German-born merchant, Gustav Christian Schwabe in the Singapore company. Schwabe and his cousin established Sykes Schwabe & Co in Liverpool. The Liverpool partner would export products like textiles, biscuits, brandies and steel to the East, while the Singapore partner would trade with Eastern produce such as coffee and spices. The freedom of port made Singapore an ideal market for trading among imported manufacturers. Import of Western commodities such as textiles and machinery had to be balanced with exports of Eastern produce such as copra, coconut, pepper and tapioca. Boustead & Co had a \\"Balance of Trade\\", where demand for goods from the East had to be balanced with demand for goods from the West. The old Boustead logo represented Boustead offices in Singapore and Malaysia. Singapore merchant, Tan Kim Seng, was a middleman in Boustead's trading activities.Maclean Roderick. \\"A Pattern of Change ‚Äì The Singapore International Chamber of Commerce from 1837\\". The Chamber and its Founding Fathers, pp. 17 ‚Äì 27. He was also a good friend of Boustead. Tan amassed small shipments of produce from local traders for Boustead, who would then ship the produce to the West. With a wide trading network, trade credit and finance became increasingly important to banks, merchants, manufacturers and traders. Edward Boustead actively contributed to the Singapore's trading activities and economy. Boustead & Co was the first agent for Hongkong and Shanghai Bank in Singapore, offering banking facilities to businesses. Brokers and sellers could draw a specific percentage of advances against the value of their goods stored in the Boustead warehouse. Such financing was called \\"trust receipts\\", where the merchant would hold the goods in trust for the banks. In 1850, Boustead also set up a London office, Edward Boustead & Co, to oversee the other offices in Hong Kong, Manila, Shanghai and Singapore. Between 1863 and 1877 Edward Boustead owned shares in vessels managed by Killick Martin & Company. Apart from the three main partners, James Killick, James Henry Martin and David William Ritchie, the next principle shareholder was Edward Boustead, who held shares in 11 vessels. Two of Boustead‚Äôs partners in Boustead & Company, William Wardrop Shaw and Jasper Young also held shares in some of the vessels. Jasper Young owned 40 shares in ‚ÄòMabel Young‚Äô presumably named after his wife or daughter. During the late 1880s, Boustead & Co took advantage of the introduction of the rubber tree to Malaysia and eventually became a leading rubber plantation manager and owner of 49 rubber plantations with a total planted area of 141,629 acres. In 1892 Boustead & Co handled the first shipment of bulk oil to Penang and shortly after this the Shell Transport and Trading Company was formed with Isaac Henderson acting as one of its original directors. Boustead represented and operated on Shell‚Äôs behalf in Penang until 1920 when Shell opened its own branch. By 1899, Singapore had become the world‚Äôs main exporter of tin. Boustead & Co played a leading role as promoter and investor in the tin smelting facility on Pulau Brani, constructed by the Straits Trading Company. From that point forward, Straits Tin became one of the leading businesses of Boustead & Co. Over the decades, the excellent reputation of Boustead & Co allowed it to attract some of the world‚Äôs most famous brands to give it agency rights in Singapore and around the region. Some of the famous brand names that became synonymous with Boustead were Cadbury‚Äôs, Nestle, Del Monte, Gillette, Procter & Gamble, Johnnie Walker, Hennessy, Moet & Chandon, Nissan, Suzuki and Thomas Cook. After his death in 1888, Boustead's associates took over the business. Boustead Plc (formerly known as Taiping Rubber Plantations Limited) was founded in 1910 and eventually listed as Boustead Plc on the London Stock Exchange. Having survived World War I, Boustead & Co played a significant role in the rise of Singapore as the world‚Äôs largest port, with a booming business in cargo, freight handling, insurance and ship services. Boustead & Co represented over 20 major shipping lines and numerous insurance agencies including the renowned Lloyd‚Äôs, which Boustead represented for more than one century. After World War II, Malaysia declared independence from the British in August 1957 and Singapore declared independence from Malaysia in 1965. This saw Boustead & Co split into three entities, Boustead plc in London, Boustead Holdings Berhad in Malaysia and Boustead Singapore Limited which listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange on 17 October 1975. Boustead Limited formed out of Boustead plc and was renamed later Boustead & Co Limited, which is the holding company for financial services, including corporate finance, principal investing and asset management. Role in development of Singapore Boustead was a shareholder in the Tanjong Pagar Dock Company (now known as the Port of Singapore Authority). He was also a key investor in the Straits Trading Company, the first tin foundry in Singapore. A pioneer in Singapore's newspaper industry, Boustead was a co-founder of the Singapore Free Press with architect George Drumgoole Coleman and William Napier. The newspaper was the forerunner of The Straits Times. An enterprising businessman in the trading sector, Boustead was one of the founding members of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce in 1837.Maclean Roderick. \\"A Pattern of Change ‚Äì The Singapore International Chamber of Commerce from 1837\\". The Chinese and the Chamber, pp. 30 ‚Äì 31. The institution promoted trade in Singapore through establishing shipping, protecting trade on behalf of merchants and encouraging trade activities among merchants. Boustead was active in community activities as well. He started the Horticultural Society, which supported the cultivation of pepper, cotton, sugar and other tropical produce. The Horticultural Society was responsible for pioneering the Singapore Botanic Gardens. In 1829, Boustead started the first Singapore Club, which was called the Billiards Club. Edward Boustead's house, designed and built by George Drumgoole Coleman, was one of the exclusive villas on Singapore's Esplanade. It was later converted into a hotel, renamed the Grand Hotel de l'Europe.Turnbull C. M.. \\"A History of Singapore 1819‚Äì1988\\". (Second Ed) The Spirited and Splendid Little Colony, pp. 46. The site where Boustead's villa stood is now occupied by the old Supreme Court. Philanthropy and Social Impact Investments Many sailors were left homeless when they were sick or too old to work. Boustead was an altruistic man and he felt compassion for these sailors. He built the Boustead Institute, situated at Tanjong Pagar. The building came to be known as the Sailor's Home, providing accommodation for sailors of ships visiting the port as well. Boustead also donated charitably to hospitals, schools and churches. Some of these buildings included Raffles Institution, Saint Joseph's Institution and the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd. In 2014 Boustead & Co co-founded Noble Tree Property Investment, a socially minded property company that develops, owns, lets and sells affordable housing and specialty supported housing developments across the United Kingdom. In 2015 Boustead & Co founded Boustead Asset Management Limited in Mauritius to serve as the investment advisor to Boustead Investment Fund, a social impact investment fund with a focus on investing in socially conscious investments. The asset manager and fund are regulated by the Financial Services Commission in Mauritius and were granted a Collective Investment Scheme Manager Licence and Category 1 Global Business Licence by the Financial Services Commission. Family Boustead had a daughter, Helen Boustead, who was born in 1857. Helen Boustead married William Niven and the couple gave birth to a son, William Edward Graham Niven. William Edward Graham Niven then married socialite Henrietta Julia Degacher. Their first child was James David Graham Niven, better known as David Niven. Niven's film career spanned over 90 films, and he was best known for his roles in Around the World in 80 Days (1956), The Pink Panther (1963) and Casino Royale (1967). There has been some dispute over Niven's paternity, with one biographer claiming that Niven himself believed his biological father to be Sir Thomas Comyn-Platt, whom his mother later remarried after her first husband was killed on active service in 1915.

She was the first woman admiral in the modern world (if Artemisia I is not included). Her troops were drawn from Aceh's widows and the army named the \\"Inong Balee\\", after the Inong Balee Fortress near the city of Banda Aceh. Some historians rate Keumalahayati as an equal of Semiramis and Catherine the Great, while references to her can be found in some Chinese and Western literature. History The grave of Malahayati of Aceh Malahayati was a daughter of Admiral Machmud Syah of the Aceh Empire. After graduating from Pesantren, an Islamic school, she continued her studies at the Aceh Royal Military Academy, known as Ma‚Äôhad Baitul Maqdis. Following the fall of Malacca to Portuguese invaders, Aceh became a stronger faction and ensured that merchant shipping routes in the Malacca Strait remained exclusively for Asian traders. The kingdom's leader, Sultan Alauddin Mansur Syah strengthened his military power by building a powerful navy to which he decided to appoint Malahayati, a widowed Aceh warrior, as his First Admiral. Aceh soldiers and the other generals had always respected Malahayati. She had also proved herself a legendary commander during several battles with the Portuguese and Dutch. In 1599, Dutch expedition commander Cornelis de Houtman arrived at the port of Aceh. The Sultan accepted him peacefully until de Houtman insulted him. The Dutchman, who had already clashed with the Banten Sultanate in northwest Java before his arrival in Aceh, decided to attack. Malahayati led her Inong Balee Army in response to the Dutch challenge and after several violent battles, finally killed de Houtman on September 11, 1599. In 1600, the Dutch Navy, led by Paulus van Caerden, robbed an Aceh merchant ship of its pepper off the Aceh coast. After this incident, In June 1601, Malahayati ordered the arrest of Dutch Admiral Jacob van Neck. After many incidents which blocked Dutch Navy expeditions and the threat from the Spanish fleet, Maurits van Oranje sent emissaries with diplomatic letter of apology to the Empire of Aceh. The emissaries were Admiral Laurens Bicker and Gerard de Roy. In August 1601, Malahayati met Maurits's emissaries for a treaty agreement. A ceasefire was agreed and the Dutch paid 50 thousand gulden as compensation for Paulus van Caerden actions, while Malahayati released Dutch prisoners. After the agreement, the Sultan sent three emissaries to the Netherlands. In June 1602, Malahayati's reputation as the guardian of the Aceh Kingdom led England to choose a peaceful, diplomatic method by which to enter the Malacca Strait. A letter from Queen Elizabeth I was brought by James Lancaster to the Sultan, and it was Malahayati who led the negotiation with Lancaster. The agreement opened the English route to Java, and they were soon afterwards able to build merchant offices in Banten. Elizabeth I rewarded Lancaster with a knighthood for his successful diplomacy in Aceh and Banten. Malahayati was killed in combat while attacking the Portuguese fleet at Teuluk Krueng Raya. She was buried at lereng Bukit Kota Dalam, a small fishing village 34 km from Banda Aceh. Reception Today, Malahayati has had naval ships, universities, hospitals and roads in several Sumatran cities named after her.

His business W.O. Oldman, Ethnographical Specimens, London was mostly active between the late 1890s and 1913. Oldman purchased collections from various sources including items that were considered surplus from many small British museums. He produced a series of auction catalogues between 1901 and 1913 that were well illustrated with photographs and remain an important reference for collectors, subject experts and museums to this day. In addition to holding auctions he also reserved items for possible sale to private collectors and scholars. He maintained frequent correspondence with his network of collectors and he was often visited by museum professionals and scholars from institutions around the world. Oldman continued to deal in artifacts after 1913 but ceased to arrange auctions. Instead he sent out artefact lists to his contacts. These were also illustrated with photographs and were issued on a bi-weekly or monthly basis. Ethnographic specimens with a provenance to Oldman's business can be found in various public institutions around the world including the National Museum of the American Indian, Pitt Rivers Museum, the British Museum and others. Items were either collected directly from Oldman or were part of donations from other significant collectors. In addition to his business Oldman also had a substantial personal collection. His focus was on Oceania. Despite his particular interest in this area Oldman never travelled to the Pacific. In June 1925 he married Dorothy K. Loney. In 1927 Oldman retired and created a private museum in his house at 43 Poynders Road, Clapham Park, London. The photographs of the interior of his house at this time show rooms packed with weapons, carvings, textiles, and weaving squeezed into every available space. Despite the bombing raids during World War II Oldman, his wife, and his collection remained in the house. All survived intact despite hits on houses in close proximity. The catalogue of Polynesian and Maori items in Oldman's private collection was published in sections in The Journal of the Polynesian Society based in the University of Auckland, New Zealand. On 13 August 1948 Oldman sold his private collection of Oceanic material to the New Zealand Government for some 44,000 pounds stirling. The New Zealand Government distributed the collection to various regional museums including the Dominion Museum, the Auckland Museum, Canterbury Museum, Otago Museum and various others on long-term loan. In 1992 the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa Act was passed and the New Zealand Government, under section 26 of the act, transferred legal ownership and administration of the Oldman Collection to The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. The collection remains distributed among the regional museums of New Zealand. Less than a year later Oldman died on 30 June 1949. His widow sold the last of his stock to the British Museum in 1950.

The angel and figure to the right have been defaced almost completely except for the angel's cloth, and the faces of all of the remaining figures have been defaced as well except for the figure standing to the right. The rear fa√ßades of the church and chapel are partially in ruin, and at one time there had been other rooms attached to the front fa√ßade of the structure, as is evident from the remnants of collapsed walls.

Text Annotation is the practice and the result of adding a note or gloss to a text, which may include highlights or underlining, comments, footnotes, tags, and links. Text annotations can include notes written for a reader's private purposes, as well as shared annotations written for the purposes of collaborative writing and editing, commentary, or social reading and sharing. In some fields, text annotation is comparable to metadata insofar as it is added post hoc and provides information about a text without fundamentally altering that original text. Text annotations are sometimes referred to as marginalia, though some reserve this term specifically for hand-written notes made in the margins of books or manuscripts. Annotations are extremely useful and help to develop knowledge of English literature. This article covers both private and socially shared text annotations, including hand-written and information technology-based annotation. For information on annotation of Web content, including images and other non-textual content, see also Web annotation.  History  Text annotation may be as old as writing on media, where it was possible to produce an additional copy with a reasonable effort. It became a prominent activity around 1000 AD in Talmudic commentaries and Arabic rhetorics treaties. In the Medieval era, scribes who copied manuscripts often made marginal annotations that then circulated with the manuscripts and were thus shared with the community; sometimes annotations were copied over to new versions when such manuscripts were later recopied. With the rise of the printing press and the relative ease of circulating and purchasing individual (rather than shared) copies of texts, the prevalence of socially shared annotations declined and text annotation became a more private activity consisting of a reader interacting with a text. Annotations made on shared copies of texts (such as library books) are sometimes seen as devaluing the text, or as an act of defacement. Thus, print technologies support the circulation of annotations primarily as formal scholarly commentary or textual footnotes or endnotes rather than marginal, handwritten comments made by private readers, though handwritten comments or annotations were common in collaborative writing or editing. Computer-based technologies have provided new opportunities for individual and socially shared text annotations that support multiple purposes, including readers' individual reading goals, learning, social reading, writing and editing, and other practices. Text annotation in Information Technology (IT) systems raises technical issues of access, linkage, and storage that are generally not relevant to paper-based text annotation, and thus research and development of such systems often addresses these areas.  Functions and Applications  Text annotations can serve a variety of functions for both private and public reading and communication practices. In their article \\"From the Margins to the Center: The Future of Annotation,\\" scholars Joanna Wolfe and Christine Neuwirth identify four primary functions that text annotations commonly serve in the modern era, including: (1)\\"facilitat[ing] reading and later writing tasks,\\" which includes annotations that support reading for both personal and professional purposes; (2)\\"eavesdrop[ping] on the insights of other readers,\\" which involves sharing of annotations; (3)\\"provid[ing] feedback to writers or promote communication with collaborators,\\" which can include personal, professional, and education- related feedback; and (4)\\"call[ing] attention to topics and important passages,\\" for which scholarly annotations, footnotes, and call-outs often function. Regarding the ways that annotations can support individual reading tasks, Catherine Marshall points out that the ways that readers annotate texts depends on the purpose, motivation, and context of reading. Readers may annotate to help interpret a text, to call attention to a section for future reference or reading, to support memory and recall, to help focus attention on the text as they read, to work out a problem related to the text, or create annotations not specifically related to the text at all. = Educational applications = Educational research in text annotation has examined the role that both private and shared text annotations can play in supporting learning goals and communication. Much educational research examines how students' private annotation of texts supports comprehension and memory; for example, research indicates that annotating texts causes more in-depth processing of information, which results in greater recall of information. Other areas of educational research investigate the benefits of socially shared text annotations for collaborative learning, both for paper-based and IT-based annotation sharing. For example, studies by Joanna Wolfe have investigated the benefits of exposure to others' annotations on student readers and writers. In a 2000 study, Wolfe found that exposing students to others' annotations influenced their perceptions of the annotators, which in turn shaped their responses to the material and their written products. In a later study, Wolfe found that viewing others' written comments on a paper text, especially pairs of annotations that present opposing responses to the text, can help students engage in the type of critical reading and stance-taking necessary for effective argumentative writing. While shared annotations can benefit individual readers, it is important to note that, \\"since the 1920s, literacy theory has increasingly emphasized the importance of social factors in the development of literacy.\\" Thus, shared annotations can not only help one to better understand the content of a particular text, but may also aid in the acquirement of literacy skills. For example, a mother may leave marks inside a book to draw the attention of her child to a particular theme or concept; thanks to the development of audio annotations, parents may now leave notes for children who are just starting to read and may struggle with textual annotations. More recent research in the effects of shared text annotations has focused on the learning applications for web-based annotation systems, some of which were developed based on design recommendations from studies outlined above. For example, Ananda Gunawardena, Aaron Tan, and David Kaufer conducted a pilot study to examine whether annotating documents in Classroom Salon, a web-based annotation and social reading platform, encouraged active reading, error detection, and collaboration in a computer science course at Carnegie Mellon University. This study suggested a correlation between students' overall performance in the course and their ability to identify errors in a text that they annotated in Classroom Salon; it also found that students were likely to change their annotations in response to annotations made by others in the course. Similarly, the web-based annotation tool HyLighter was used in a first-year writing course and shown to improve the development of students' mental models of texts, including supporting reading comprehension, critical thinking, and the ability to develop a thesis. The collaboration with peers and experts around a shared text improved these skills and brought the communities' understanding closer together. A meta- analysis of empirical studies into the higher-education uses of social annotation (SA) tools indicates such tools have been tested in several courses, among them English, sport psychology, and hypermedia. Studies have indicated that social annotation functions, including commenting, information sharing, and highlighting, can support instruction designed to foster collaborative learning and communication, as well as reading comprehension, metacognition, and critical analysis. Several studies indicated that students enjoyed using social annotation tools, and that it improved motivation in the course. = Writing and text-centered collaboration = Text annotations have long been used in writing and revision processes as a way for reviewers to suggest changes and communicate about a text. In book publishing, for example, the collaboration of authors and editors to develop and revise a manuscript frequently involves exchanges of both in-line revisions or notes as well as marginal annotations. Similarly, copyeditors often make marginal annotations or notes that explain or suggest revisions or are directed at the author as questions or suggestions (commonly called \\"queries\\"). Asynchronous collaborative writing and document development often depend on text annotations as a way not only to suggest revisions but also to exchange ideas during document development or to facilitate group decision making, though such processes are often complicated by the use of different communication technologies (such as phone calls or emails as well as document sharing) for distinct tasks. Text annotations can also function to allow group or community members to communicate about a shared text, such as a doctor annotating a patient's chart. Much research into the functionality and design of collaborative IT-based writing systems, which often support text annotation, has occurred in the area of computer-supported cooperative work. = Linguistic annotation = In corpus linguistics, digital philology and natural language processing, annotations are used to explicate linguistic, textual or other features of a text (or other digital representations of natural language). In linguistics, annotations include comments and metadata; non- transcriptional annotations are also non-linguistic. In these disciplines, annotations are the basis for quantitative research, empirical studies and the application of machine learning. Unlike annotations in the above-mentioned uses (that appear very sparsely), linguistic annotation usually requires that every element (token) within a text carries one or multiple annotations, and that complex relations between different annotations exist. A number of specialized formats (and tools) for this purpose exist, the following illustrates an annotation with tab-separated values as used in the Universal Dependencies project. Here, every word within a sentence is identified by a number (column 1, Fig. 2. Sample for Universal Dependencies annotation, English Web Treebank, visualization by [https://brat.nlplab.org/ Brat \`ID\`), and it carries annotations for * its string value (\`FORM\`, col 2) * part of speech (\`POS\`, col 3) * lemma (\`LEMMA\`, col 4) * morphological features (\`FEAT\`, col 5) * syntactic dependencies (\`HEAD\`, col 6) * syntactic relations (dependencies, \`DEP\`, col 7; extended dependencies in col 8) * comments (empty here, col 9) 1 What what DET WDT PronType=Int 2 det 2:det _ 2 language language NOUN NN Number=Sing 4 nsubj:pass 4:nsubj:pass _ 3 is be AUX VBZ Mood=IndNumber=SingPerson=3Tense=PresVerbForm=Fin 4 aux:pass 4:aux:pass _ 4 talked talk VERB VBN Tense=PastVerbForm=Part 0 root 0:root _ 5 in in ADP IN _ 6 case 6:case _ 6 Iguazu Iguazu PROPN NNP Number=Sing 4 obl 4:obl:in SpaceAfter=No 7 ? ? PUNCT . _ 4 punct 4:punct _ A visualization of the example is given in Fig. 2. In addition to word-level annotations, the word (and the sentence, etc.) in this format can carry metadata. Various other annotation formats do exist, often coupled with certain pieces of software for their creation, processing or querying, see Ide et al. (2017) for an overview. The Linguistic Annotation Wiki describes tools and formats for creating and managing linguistic annotations. Selected problems and applications are also discussed under Overlapping markup and Web annotation. Aside from tab-separated values and other text formats, formats for linguistic annotations are often based on markup languages such as XML (and formerly, Sgml), more complex annotations may also employ graph-based data models and formats such as JSON-LD, e.g., in accordance with the Web Annotation standard. Linguistic annotation comes with an independent research tradition and its own terminology: The target of an annotation is usually referred to as a 'markable', the body of the annotation as 'annotation', the relation between annotation and markable is usually expressed in the annotation format (e.g., by having annotations and text side-by side), so that explicit anchors are not necessary.  Structure and Design  Research in the design and development of annotation systems uses specific terminology to refer to distinct structural components of annotations and also distinguishes among options for digital annotation displays. =Annotation structure= The structural components of any annotation can be roughly divided into three primary elements: a body, an anchor, and a marker. The body of an annotation includes reader-generated symbols and text, such as handwritten commentary or stars in the margin. The anchor is what indicates the extent of the original text to which the body of the annotation refers; it may include circles around sections, brackets, highlights, underlines, and so on. Annotations may be anchored to very broad stretches of text (such as an entire document) or very narrow sections (such as a specific letter, word, or phrase). The marker is the visual appearance of the anchor, such as whether it is a grey underline or a yellow highlight. An annotation that has a body (such as a comment in the margin) but no specific anchor has no marker. =Annotation display types= IT-based annotation systems utilize a variety of display options for annotations, including: * Footnote interfaces that display annotations below the corresponding text * Aligned annotations that display comments and notes vertically in the text margins, sometimes in multiple columns or as a \\"sidebar\\" layer * Interlinear annotations that attach annotations directly into a text * Sticky note interfaces, where annotations appear in popup dialogs over the source text * Voice annotations, in which reviewers record annotations and embed them within a document * Pen or digital-ink based interfaces that allow writing directly on a document or screen Annotation interfaces may also allow highlighting or underlining, as well as threaded discussions. Sharing and communicating through annotations anchored to specific documents is sometimes referred to as anchored discussion.  IT- based text annotation systems  IT-based annotation systems include standalone and client-server systems. In the 1980s and 1990s, a number of such systems were built in the context of libraries, patent offices, and legal text processing. Their design led researchers to produce taxonomies of annotation forms.Marshall, Catherine C.: Annotation: from paper books to the digital library, Proceedings of the ACM Digital Libraries '97 Conference, Philadelphia, PA. Text annotation research has taken place at several institutions, including Xerox research centers in Palo Alto and Grenoble (France), the Hitachi Central Research Lab (in particular for annotation of patents), and in relation with the construction of the new French National Library between 1989 and 1995Virbel, Jacques, Reading and managing texts on the Biblioth√®que de France station, The digital word: text-based computing in the humanities book contents, MIT Press 1993, Cambridge, USA, pp 31-51. at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse and in the company AIS (Advanced Innovation Systems). Annotation functionality has been present in text processing software for many years through inline notes displayed as pop- ups, footnotes, and endnotes; however, it is only recently that functionality for displaying annotations as marginalia has appeared in programs such as OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice Writer and Microsoft Word. Personal or standalone annotation include word processing software that supports embedded or anchored text annotations as well as Adobe Acrobat, which in addition to commenting allows highlights, stamps, and other types of markup. = Web-based text annotation systems = Tim Berners-Lee had already implemented the concept of directly editing web documents in 1990 in WorldWideWeb, the first web browser, but later ported versions removed this collaborative ability. An early version of NCSA Mosaic in 1993 also included a collaborative annotation capability, though it was quickly removed. Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, WebDAV, was then reintroduced as an extension. A different approach to distributed authoring consists in first gathering many annotations from a wide public, and then integrate them all in order to produce a further version of a document. This approach was pioneered by Stet, the system put in place to gather comments on drafts of version 3 of the GNU General Public License. This system arose after a specific requirement, which it served egregiously, but was not so easily configurable as to be convenient for annotating any other document on the web. The co-ment system uses annotation interface concepts similar to Stet's, but it is based on an entirely new implementation, using Django/Python on the server side and various AJAX libraries such as JQuery on the client side. Both Stet and co-ment are licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License. Since 2011, the non-profit Hypothes Is Project has offered the free, open web annotation service Hypothes.is. The service features annotation via a Chrome extension, bookmarklet or proxy server, as well as integration into a LMS or CMS. Both webpages and PDFs can be annotated. Other web-based text annotation systems are collaborative software for distributed text editing and versioning, which also feature annotation and commenting interfaces. Specialized Web-based text annotations exist in the context of scientific publication, either for refereeing or post-publication. The on-line journal PLoS ONE, published by the Public Library of Science, has developed its own Web-based system where scientists and the public can comment on published articles. The annotations are displayed as pop-ups with an anchor in the text.

Montgomery umpired in the West Australian National Football League (now known as the West Australian Football League) and the Victorian Football League. Working life He began his working life as a coach builder for the Western Australian Government Railways at the Midland Railway Workshops. After going to teacher's college he became an art teacher, becoming an Arts Master at Churchlands College. Playing career Montgomery played football at school and in the Temperance League before playing reserve grade for Swan Districts. His playing career was brought to an end by a cracked vertebra. Umpiring career Montgomery commenced umpiring football with Metropolitan Juniors in 1949. =WANFL= Montgomery joined the WANFL umpiring panel in 1950 and was soon umpiring league football, making his debut in a match between East Fremantle and Swan Districts at Fremantle Oval in Round 4 of the 1952 season. In 1959 Montgomery officiated in his first grand final, between East Perth and Subiaco at Subiaco Oval. During Round 1 of the 1956 season Montgomery reported Jack Sheedy for using abusive language towards him, to which Sheedy responded at the tribunal by swearing on a bible that Montgomery had reported the wrong player. Despite the theatrics, Sheedy was found guilty of the charge. In 1963 he made a complaint to the WANFL over an incident that occurred after he had umpired a match between East Fremantle and South Fremantle at East Fremantle Oval. He alleged that as he was walking out of the ground, a player drove a car toward him, attempting to run him over. He retired in 1972 having umpired 308 WANFL league matches including five grand finals. =VFL= While studying art at the Melbourne Technical College Montgomery umpired two league matches during the 1965 Victorian Football League season. Later life and legacy Montgomery was responsible for redesigning the Swan Districts logo after Swans coach Haydn Bunton, Jr. suggested it needed livening up. After retiring Montgomery took up bowls and was a member of the Manning Bowls Club for over three decades. The award for best WAFL field umpire is named the Ray Montgomery Medal in his honour. In 2002 Montgomery was named as one of three field umpires in the WANFL Umpires Association Team of the Half Century. In 2004 he was inducted into the West Australian Football Hall of Fame.

He was instrumental in the expansion of the Royal Australian Engineers (RAE) in preparation for the war against Japan. Early life Born on 30 September 1892 at Canterbury, Melbourne the son of Herbert Selwyn Steele and Alice Lydia n√©e Sinclair, Clive was educated at Scotch College (prefect and captain of boats, 1910), and the University of Melbourne (B.C.E. 1919). He joined the Militia in 1912.Darryl Bennet, 'Steele, Sir Clive Selwyn (1892‚Äì1955)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 16, Melbourne University Press, 2002, pp 296‚Äì297. First World War Appointed as a second lieutenant in the Royal Australian Engineers (RAE), Australian Imperial Force on 8 October 1915, he sailed for Egypt in November with the 5th Field Company. Arriving on the Western Front in March 1916, he was promoted to captain in September. While on recreation leave he married Amie Osland Bilson on 6 January 1917 at West Brompton, London. During actions around P√©ronne, France in August 1918, he commanded a unit undertaking repairs to bridges while under artillery and machine-gun fire. On 31 August he undertook reconnaissance in front of the Australian lines, providing details of the state of bridges across the River Somme and the Somme Canal. For this action he was awarded the Military Cross. He was promoted to major in October. Arriving back in Australia he was discharged on 1 August 1919. Interwar Finishing his engineering degree at Melbourne University in 1919, he gained employment with Australian Reinforced Concrete & Engineering Co. until 1921 and then with James Hardie & Co. Pty Ltd from 1921 to 1923. Setting up private practice in 1924 as a consulting engineer, he designed and supervised structural works including the State Savings Bank of Victoria building in Melbourne, the members' stand at Flemington Racecourse, the National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd building in Brisbane, Her Majesty's Theatre, Sydney and the Melbourne Town Hall. From 1919 he had continued to serve in the Militia. In 1926 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and appointed to command the 4th Divisional Engineers (1926‚Äì1931) and the 14th Battalion (1933‚Äì1939). Second World War With the outbreak of the Second World War, Steele was seconded to the Second Australian Imperial Force on 13 October 1939 as the commander of the 6th Divisional Engineers. He was promoted to temporary brigadier and appointed chief engineer of I Corps in April 1940. He sailed for the Middle East in September and during the Greek campaign in April 1941, he was chief engineer of the Anzac Corps. During the withdrawal at Farsala on 18 April, despite attacks by German aircraft, he organised the filling of a bomb crater in the road which was impeding the withdrawal of the allied forces. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the Greek War Cross, and was twice Mentioned in Despatches for his service in the Middle East. Transported to Java, Netherlands East Indies in January 1942, he was then sent to Sumatra on 14 February, where he helped organise the evacuation of allied troops from Oosthaven. He returned to Australia in March, and in April was promoted to temporary major general and appointed engineer-in-chief at Land Headquarters, Melbourne. In preparation for the war against Japan, he established the RAE Training Centre at Kapooka, New South Wales and increased the size of the School of Military Engineering at Liverpool, which trained sappers who disarmed mines, demolished obstacles, provided water supplies and other services to military camps, cut and milled timber, built huts, roads, bridges, railways, airfields and wharves, and operated the army's water-transport vessels. With the reorganisation of Land Headquarters in October 1943, fortifications, works, engineer stores and transport were added to Steele's responsibilities. During 1944 or 1945 he personally designed the heavy lift ship Crusader. On 12 March 1946 he transferred to the Reserve of Officers. Later life Steele had been awarded the W. C. Kernot medal for 1944 by the University of Melbourne. He was active in the Institution of Engineers, Australia and was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1953. He died of myocardial infarction on 5 August 1955 at the Repatriation General Hospital, Heidelberg and was cremated. He was survived by his wife; the couple were childless.

The Hanyi Railway was completed in spring 2012 and started commercial operations on July 1, 2012. Adjacent high-speed rail sections, the Hefei‚ÄìWuhan high-speed railway to the east and the Yichang‚àíWanzhou railway to the west, opened respectively in April 2009 and December 2010. Unlike most other high-speed railways in China which generally follow the route of pre- existing railway lines, the Hanyi railway takes a new, more direct, route between Wuhan and Yichang, bringing rail service for the first time to cities along the Yangtze River in central Hubei such as Hanchuan, Xiantao, and Qianjiang. Jingzhou, previously only served by a branch rail line to Jingmen to the north, now enjoys frequent through-train service to Wuhan and Yichang.

After formally qualifying as a clinical psychologist, he then disclosed that he had been previously detained in hospital with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Early life and education May grew up in Islington, north London.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/dr-rufus-may-one- man-and-a-bed-410698.html May qualified from the University of East London in 1998.  Experiences of mental health  May was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1986 at age 18. May was compulsorily detained in a psychiatric hospital on three occasions. He understands his psychotic experiences as a reaction to experiences of emotional loss and social isolation. Among other beliefs, he developed ideas he was an apprentice spy for the British secret service. He also experienced messages from the radio and television. This eventually led to three admissions to Hackney Hospital within 14 months. After a year of receiving psychiatric drug treatment Rufus May decided to stop being involved with psychiatric services and stop taking the drugs he was being prescribed, he then used exercise, creative activities, social relationships and voluntary work to regain his well being.  Clinical approach  Rufus May has used his professional knowledge and own experiences of psychosis to focus on developing services that are more patient centered and therapeutic approaches that are more collaborative, without relying on chemical imbalance theories of mental distress. For example, he works with those experiencing auditory hallucinations by conversing directly with the voice to help discover the meaning of these dissociative experiences. He draws upon the Nonviolent Communication style developed by Marshall Rosenberg and mindfulness. His approach received considerable publicity when it was the subject of The Doctor Who Hears Voices, a 2008 British television documentary broadcast on Channel 4 about a junior doctor helped by May to overcome her experiences of hearing voices. Directed by Leo Regan, the documentary depicts the therapy which May provided to the junior doctor, played by actress Ruth Wilson. The programme created a significant reaction with both support and criticism of May's approach and was a 2008 finalist in the Mind Mental health media awards. Religion and culture May has expressed sympathy for individuals who come from various cultural backgrounds or those who hold specific religious beliefs in regards to proper treatment. He has stated that \\"...for many people their voices are spiritual entities...we are working alongside traditional spiritual healers to create healing workshops that will help people deal with negative spirits. To insist on medicalizing this experience is now being recognized as culturally oppressive and colonial.\\"  Professional career  May has worked as a clinical psychologist in Tower Hamlets, East London, England. He currently works as a clinical psychologist in an assertive outreach team in Bradford, England. He is actively involved in consumer recovery groups such as the hearing voices network and a Bradford mental health discussion and campaign group, Evolving Minds. He often provides comments in the British media against the use of compulsory detention and the forcibly use of medications legislation. His story has received a number of awards, including a Mental Health Media Survivor and Factual Radio awards in October 2001 for Fergal Keane's show Taking a Stand on Radio Four. and a 2008 award for the TV documentary.

The campaign first aimed to identify five key reforms to the parliamentary system that the public most wanted to see enacted. The aim was then to ensure that every candidate standing in the UK 2010 General Election backed those reforms. Roots Between November 2005 and March 2006 the Power Commission examined the problem of democratic disengagement in the United Kingdom. A report was produced which highlighted the \\"Myth of Apathy\\" and the lack of political engagement, but very little action resulted from the report. Helena Kennedy, Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws, a frequently-rebellious Labour peer, who chaired the Power Commission, also chairs Power 2010, which aims to carry forward the concepts behind the Power Commission into the UK 2010 General Election. The campaign is funded by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust (previously the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust) and has been endorsed by activists such as Billy Bragg and Mark Thomas. The campaign The campaign has four phases. =Phase one= The first phase of the campaign (which has now closed) asked for suggestions from the public. The campaign received thousands of ideas from people of all political persuasions from across the UK. The call for ideas went out on 15 September and by midnight on 30 November 2009 over 4,000 had been submitted.http://www.power2010.org.uk/pages/78/ =Phase two= The thousands of ideas were organised by academics from Southampton University and fed into a deliberative poll to draw up a shortlist which would be put to the public vote. On the weekend of 9‚Äì10 January 2010, a scientific sample of 130 citizens from across the UK, selected by YouGov to be representative of the population as a whole gathered in London for a two-day deliberative event.http://www.power2010.org.uk/pages/79/ These 130 citizens participated in a Deliberative Poll organised in consultation with Professor James Fishkin of Stanford University and his colleagues at the Center for Deliberative Democracy at Stanford University, Professor Robert C. Luskin and Dr. Alice Siu. In this way, these 130 citizens distilled the many ideas received into a manageable shortlist of 29 proposals, each of which received the backing of a majority of participants. These were then put to the public vote. =Phase three= The public vote on the 29 ideas shortlisted by the Deliberative Poll began on 18 January and lasted five weeks until 22 February. During this time 100,000 votes were cast by tens of thousands of people. The five most popular ideas following the vote produced the POWER2010 Pledge.http://www.power2010.org.uk/pages/80/ =Pledge signing= Following 22 February Power2010 have begun a grass roots campaign requesting members of the public to sign a petition to back to power pledge. Currently there is no published total for the number of signatures collected as of March 2010. The public have been asked to sign the power pledge if they agree with three or more of the five power pledges, with the option to opt out of a particular pledge that they may not agree with. The power pledges The five power pledges adopted by Power 2010 following the public vote were: 1\\\\. Introduce a proportional voting system. 2\\\\. Scrap ID cards and roll back the database state. 3\\\\. Replace the House of Lords with an elected chamber. 4\\\\. Allow only English MPs to vote on English laws. 5\\\\. Draw up a written constitution. 2010 General Election campaign The aim was for as many people as possible to sign the Pledge and then take it to the candidates in their constituency, by writing to them, calling them, and attending local hustings, public meetings and MPs' surgeries. Ideally, every candidate standing in the UK 2010 General Election should make a public commitment to clean up and reform British politics. In March 2010, Power 2010 ran a full page ad in The Guardian targeting 6 MPs that it claimed were \\"failing our democracy\\" for being most against parliamentary reform. Some of the MPs in question have responded by questioning the motives of Power 2010 and claiming that it is a front for the Liberal Democrats. The 6 MPs were: *Shipley Conservative MP Philip Davies, who was re-elected with an increased majority. *Harrow East Labour MP Tony McNulty, who lost his seat to Bob Blackman of the Conservatives. *Glasgow South Labour MP Tom Harris, who was re-elected with an increased majority. *Shrewsbury Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski, who was re-elected with an increased majority. *Cardiff South and Penarth Labour MP Alun Michael, who was re-elected with a reduced majority *Wells Conservative MP David Heathcoat- Amory, who lost his seat to Liberal Democrat Tessa Munt.

He obtained a position with the Dutch Ministry of the Interior as an apprentice to Jacobus Lebret, under whom he studied mathematics, earthwork construction, and hydraulic engineering practices. Career In 1865, De Rijke worked for Cornelis Johannes van Doorn building the Oranje lock which closed off the IJ from the Zuiderzee at Schellingwoude near Amsterdam. De Rijke was the chief construction foreman. When Van Doorn was invited to travel to Japan in 1872, he encouraged De Rijke to join him in re-designing the port of Osaka. =Japan= In September 1873, De Rijke arrived in Japan together with Van Doorn and George Arnold Escher. During the next thirty years, these three civil engineers developed a range of flood control and water management projects.\\"Johannis de Rijke: the Dutch Sensai\\", Radio Netherlands Archives, April 15, 2002 He improved the ports of Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagasaki, Ujina (Hiroshima), Hakata (Fukuoka), Mikuni (Sakai) and Niigata. His breakwater at the port of Yokkaichi is recognized by the Japanese government as an Important Cultural Property. De Rijke also developed plans to improve riparian zones of several Japanese rivers. Notably, his groundwork and planning caused separation of the Kiso River, Nagara River and Ibi River near Nagoya, also known as the .Karan, Pradyumna Prasad. (2005). Importantly, De Rijke was responsible for the construction of a tunnel channel from Lake Biwa to Kyoto. He is also credited with building the Tokyo Kanda River sewer network. After 1891, De Rijke was appointed an Imperial officer of the Meiji Home Ministry, where he rose to the position of Vice Minister in this Japanese government bureaucracy.Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Tokyo , \\"Dutch-Japanese relations, Dutch Civil Engineers in the Meiji Period\\" ; retrieved 2013-4-5.

In 1897, he returned to Shanghai for a second report of Huangpu river. In 1901, he returned to China to participate in the Yellow River flood control project. In June 1906, he was officially appointed as the first chief engineer of the Whangpoo Conservancy Board. Before his return to the Netherlands in 1909, he carried out a number of riverway projects on Huangpu river, including the Wusong Jetty (built by the Huangpu's mouth) and the Gaoqiao new channel. His work successfully eliminated most of the shoals and achieved the preliminary goal of Huangpu channel improvement: the lowest water depth at Huangpu's mouth has been deepened from 15 ft to 21 ft, and in the Gaoqiao new channel from 2-3 ft to 19 ft.

It was established in 2010 to operate Herons in Afghanistan. Following the withdrawal of the Heron detachment from that country in 2014, conducted training missions in Australia to maintain the RAAF's expertise in operating unmanned aerial vehicles until more advanced types are delivered. The Herons were retired in June 2017, and the flight was disbanded by the end of that year. History No. 5 Flight was raised on 18 January 2010 at RAAF Base Amberley as part of No. 82 Wing. The flight's initial role was to operate the RAAF's small fleet of IAI Heron remotely piloted aircraft which were based at Kandahar in Afghanistan. On 13 April 2013 the responsibility for Heron RPA transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force's Surveillance and Response Group. At this time the flight's responsibilities included training personnel from all branches of the Australian Defence Force to operate the Herons in Australia, and maintaining a detachment of personnel at Kandahar to operate the RPAs as part of Operation Slipper, Australia's contribution to the war in Afghanistan. The RAAF acquired a third Heron during 2011 which No. 5 Flight used to train RPA operators in Australia; prior to this time Heron operators were trained in Canada. The RAAF's Air Force newspaper reported in May 2011 that No. 5 Flight comprised a \\"handful of members\\". On 4 April 2013 the flight transferred to No. 92 Wing; at this time it had a strength of 18 full-time personnel and three reservists, and operated four Herons. Three of the UAVs were deployed to Afghanistan and the fourth was in Australia. As of 2013, most of No. 5 Flight's UAV operators had been fixed-wing aircraft pilots from the RAAF, Army and Navy. After a further extension of their mission, the Heron detachment was scheduled to remain in Afghanistan until the end of 2014. It was announced in October 2014 that two Herons will be retained in Australia for a six-year period; at this time one of the UAVs was based at Woomera, South Australia and the other will be transported from Afghanistan. It was planned for the two Herons to also operate from other Australian military and civilian airfields. The final Heron UAV detachment left Afghanistan in December 2014. As of 2016, the main role of No. 5 Flight was to maintain the RAAF's expertise in operating UAVs until more capable types such as the Northrop Grumman MQ-4C Triton were delivered. No. 5 Flight was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation in the Queen's birthday Honours on the 13 June 2016 for \\"sustained outstanding service in warlike operations through the provision of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance capability on Operation Slipper, over the period January 2010 to November 2014.\\" No. 5 Flight's Herons were retired in June 2017, with the last flight of the type taking place from RAAF Base Tindal on 23 June. As of August 2017, No. 5 Flight was scheduled to be disbanded by the end of the year.

Safety cases are often required as part of a regulatory process, a certificate of safety being granted only when the regulator is satisfied by the argument presented in a safety case. Industries regulated in this way include transportation (such as aviation, the automotive industry and railways) and medical devices. As such there are strong parallels with the formal evaluation of risk used to prepare a Risk Assessment, although the result will be case specific. A vehicle safety case may show it to be acceptably safe to be driven on a road, but conclude that it may be unsuited to driving on rough ground, or with an off-center load for example, if there would then be a greater risk of danger e.g. a loss of control or an injury to the occupant. The information used to compile the safety case may then formally guarantee further specifications, such as maximum safe speeds, permitted safe loads, or any other operational parameter. A safety case should be revisited when an existing product is to be re- purposed in a new way, if this extends beyond the scope of the original assessment. Presenting a safety case A safety case aims to show that specific safety claims are substantiated and, in the UK, that risks are kept 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP). In the USA, the FDA issued a guidance document in 2010 to require infusion pump manufacturers to submit safety cases as part of the 510(k)s.FDA: Medical Devices. A definition by UK Defence Standard 00-56 Issue 4 states: Such an evidence-based approach can be contrasted with a prescriptive approach to safety certification, which require safety to be justified using a prescribed process. Such standards typically do not explicitly require an explicit argument for safety and instead rest on the assumption that following the prescribed process will generate the required evidence for safety. Many UK standards are non-prescriptive and call for an argument-based approach to justify safety, hence why a safety case is required. Safety cases are typically documented in both textual and graphical notations, e.g. using the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN).GSN Community Standard Safety Cases are becoming more popular on civil/commercial aircraft and Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems as complexity and criticality increase. A paradigm shift is often necessary to accept Safety Cases as traditional system safety and software safety analysis and verification approaches and processes are not adequately structured to present an effective safety argument on some more modern architectures using modern development tools and formal methods. Some major programs in the US Department of Defense, such as the F-35 Vehicle Management System (VMS) are using Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) effectively on highly complex, software intensive and safety-critical airborne system functions, along with Goal Structuring Notation (GSN). Safety Assessments and more elaborate and comprehensive Safety Cases with GSN are effective so long as Refuting Arguments and much scrutiny using traditional hazard analyses and safety approaches are included and models used to depict system behavior. More elaborate models and formal methods are being used for collective safety evidence. In the UK, GSN as part of Safety Cases have proven to be useful for providing objective safety evidence. A Safety Case is an ideal way to reflect the MBSE model, software use cases, safety architecture, safety critical functional behavior, safe states, and sequencing in the safety domain. Functional behavior is often better understood, expressed and defended when graphically displayed every step of the way in MBSE vs. traditional development with enormous paperwork that is very difficult to correlate into an effective Safety Case. The SAE International G-48 System Safety Committee held The Safety Case Workshop at APT Research in Huntsville, AL on 15 January 2014 with several DoD agencies and leading contractors present to further study and capture the Safety Case process and methods for refinement and possible future promulgation in several Safety Standards, as several already use as part of internal best practices. Journal of System Safety, Volume 51, No.1 Winter 2015 on page 19 The G-48, composed of a NASA safety Office, DoD Agencies and several leading defense contractor representatives, cite several evidence based safety advantages of Safety Cases over ANSI/GEA-STD-010 and MIL-STD-882, including 1. Upfront articulation of Arguments (rationale and claims) to be used and (2) independent review to verify and validate. Since Safety Cases are structured, evidence based approaches to satisfy the safety argument established at the start of programs, they may find a good fit in augmenting existing and proven hazard analyses methods and techniques. It is envisioned as Safety Cases gain popularity and are included in current best practices they will not replace any current effective safety methods, such as Functional Hazard Assessments (FHA), but may be included in those up front and in more comprehensive and blended safety methodologies to argument and improve capturing and documenting objective safety evidence through the program. A final Safety Case should have all of the necessary and required specific artifacts such as test evidence supporting safety claims. A well balanced Safety Case must also allow for special safety directed verification, such as testing of credible failure conditions, testing of malfunctions to observe predicted safe states and planned behavior, fault insertion for expected functionality under worse case conditions, failure immunity to ensure system ignores corruption and rouge threats, and off nominal or modified conditions, out of bounds, and other type test results to prove safety requirements are met outside normal operation. Ideally, future Safety Case concepts, that are evolving as software intensive and high technology systems of systems gets more complex, must contain a focused data package with comprehensive safety artifacts and must be inclusive of all safety analyses, findings and determination of total summation of system risk. Safety Cases must go beyond the current MIL-STD-882 Safety Assessment Reports that are more general summary of hazard and risk based findings. Safety Cases with structured arguments, goals and objectives need to be more inclusive of various modern safety aspects, usually including requirements based safety (INCOSE), model based safety, software based safety (IEEE STD-1228), function based safety (IEC-61508, design based aerospace recommended practices for safety (SAE ARP 4761/4754A). Agile development methods have been applied to safety case production. The review of safety cases is an important activity in the safety engineering process, performed throughout development, operation and maintenance, in which the safety case argument and evidence are scrutinized and challenged.

It was completed in 2010, and will be part of the future Huhanrong passenger-dedicated line from Shanghai to Wuhan to Chengdu. Out of the line's total length, runs on bridges or in tunnels. According to the chief engineer, Zhang Mei, the line was the most difficult ever constructed in China. Operation started on 2010. Connections The Yichang Railway Bridge over the Yangtze River near the eastern terminus of the railway in Yichang. The railway crosses the Yangtze River a second time near its western terminus, Wanzhou. Pictured is the Wanzhou Railway Bridge. At its eastern end, the Yichang East railway station, the Yiwan Railway connects with the high-speed Hanyi railway to Hankou (Wuhan). At Liangwu railway station, the Yichang‚ÄìWanzhou railway connects with the high-speed Chongqing‚ÄìLichuan railway (Yuli), the main route of the Huhanrong corridor, which provides the most direct connection to Chongqing and on to Chengdu. From Liangwu, the Yichang‚ÄìWanzhou railway heads north to reach Wanzhou. With the Yuli and Hanyi lines both in operation and in use by high-speed, it will become possible to travel by train between Wuhan and Chongqing in around 5 hours, compared to the 22 hours before the opening of the Yiwan Line. However, the opening of high-speed service (as opposed to \\"regular\\" trains) on the Yiwan line won't happen until July 1, 2014. Until the Yuli line was completed at the end of 2013, all through traffic on the Yiwan Railway had to go along its entire length, to the line's western terminus at Wanzhou, and then over an existing railway branch to Dazhou, Sichuan. From Dazhou, trains could continue both southwest toward Chongqing on the Xiangyu Railway and west toward Chengdu on the Dazhou‚ÄìChengdu Railway.Three Gorges route linked up, Railway Gazette International, 2010 Layout The long railway crosses the remarkably difficult terrain of southwestern Hubei (Yichang City and Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture) and the eastern part of the Chongqing Municipality (Wanzhou District). The region has numerous mountains and is sometimes referred to as \\"the eastern edge\\" of the Yunnan- Guizhou Plateau. Until recently, the region had no railways, and hardly any paved roads (beyond China National Highway 318, which the new railway more or less parallels).See, e.g., the characterization of the China National Highway 318 and China National Highway 209 as \\"unstable and unsafe\\" in: Yichang‚ÄìWanzhou railway (SEIA) (Asian Development Bank, ), p.6 The new (G42 Hurong Expressway) is being built along the same corridor as well (see Si Du River Bridge for an example of engineering that was required). Out of the entire length of the rail line, are in Hubei and in Chongqing Municipality. Owing to the difficult terrain, the project involves a large number of bridges (including two over the Yangtze River: the Wanzhou Railway Bridge and the Yichang Railway Bridge) and tunnels. Out of the line's total length, runs on bridges or in tunnels. This made the line the most difficult and the most expensive (per kilometre) of all China's railways to date. At a cost of U.S. per kilometre, the per-kilometre construction costs were twice as high as those for the Qinghai‚ÄìTibet Railway which cost U.S. per kilometre. Construction history Construction of the Wanzhou Railway Bridge, at the western end of the Yiwan line The railway was first proposed by Sun Yat-sen in 1903, but construction was not started until 2003 due to the difficulties of the project.

Knockgraffon ( or also Cnoc Rath Fionn meaning \\"Hill of the fort of Fionn\\") is a townland in the civil parish of same name in County Tipperary, IrelandPlacenames Database of Ireland. The civil parish lies in the barony of Middle Third. It is also part of the ecclesiastical parish of New Inn & Knockgraffon in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly. Interesting features include a fine Motte, a church and a castle.  History  While it was once a significant settlement in its own right, by the 18th century it had been abandoned. Around 1610, the Irish historian Geoffrey Keating was appointed Parish Priest of Knockgraffon. The motte was built by the English of Leinster beside the River Suir when they were on a raid against Donal Mor, Chief of the O'Sullivan clan, in 1192. It was given by the King to William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber, but later taken from him and granted to Philip of Worcester. Nearby is a ruined 13th-century nave-and-chancel church with an east window inserted in the 15th century. A few hundred yards further away is a 16th-century tower built by the Butlers. There is evidence that the site had important historical and ritual significance in the Kingdom of Munster. Claims are advanced that it was the sacred site for the coronation of the Kings of Munster. If true, then this would place Knockgraffon second only to Tara in archaeological significance. F√≠ngen mac √Åedo Duib (died 618)all dates per The Chronology of the Irish Annals, Daniel P. McCarthy was a King of Munster from the E√≥ganacht Chaisil branch of the E√≥ganachta. After his death the throne of Cashel passed to his younger brother, Fa√≠lbe Flann mac √Åedo Duib. His descendants were known as the Cen√©l F√≠ngin, survived today by the O'Sullivans and MacGillycuddys. On the death of F√≠ngen mac √Åedo Duib, his wife M√≥r Muman re-married and eventually the throne of Munster passed to her sons by this second marriage, including Cathal C√∫-cen-m√°thair. Following this dynastic change of fortune, the O‚ÄôSullivan clan returned to Knockgraffon where they enjoyed considerable wealth and power. The O‚ÄôSullivan lands originally included Clonmel, Cahir, Carrick-on-Suir and Cashel. In Heerin‚Äôs topography, written in 1400, is found the verse: > O‚ÄôSullivan, who delights not in violence > Rules over the extensive Eoghanacht of Munster; > About Knockgraffon broad lands he obtained, > Won by his victorious arms, in conflicts and battles. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169, the O‚ÄôSullivan chiefs were recognized as princes of the E√≥ganachta nation who enjoyed considerable independence from the over-lord of Munster, the MacCarthy Mor. In 1192, the O‚ÄôSullivan clan suffered a devastating defeat and was forced to surrender its territory to the Normans invaders. The entire tribe immigrated west to the stark mountains of Cork and Kerry. Adding insult to injury, the Normans constructed a large earthen mound surrounded by a wooden fence right on the sacred hill of Rath Fionn. Eventually they also built a small stone castle near the motte. Donal Mor, the chief of the O‚ÄôSullivan clan when Knockgraffon was lost, was later assassinated by the MacCarthy Mor in 1214 to quell a movement among the Eoghanacht nation to restore the throne of Munster to the descendants of F√≠ngen. In 1998, the Knockgraffon motte was purchased by an O'Sullivan (Gary Brian Sullivan of Statesboro, Georgia, US) from its Norman- Irish owner (Donal Keating of Cahir, Ireland). It is the first time that Knockgraffon has been back in O'Sullivan possession for nearly 800 years. Other towns in the area include New Inn, County Tipperary. Marian Tobin one of the women who ran a safe house in Ireland during the Irish War of Independence and was known particularly for sheltering Dan Breen and Se√°n Treacy after the Soloheadbeg ambush was born in Knockgraffon.

From left to right in foreground: sheep heads, dried whale meat and blubber, and skerpikj√∏t. Typical summer food. From left to right in foreground: cod heads, rhubarb, and stuffed puffins. Important parts of Faroese cuisine are lamb and fish, owing to the proximity to the ocean. Traditional foods from the Faroe Islands include skerpikj√∏t (a type of dried mutton), seafood, whale meat, blubber, garnat√°lg, Faroese puffins, potatoes, and few fresh vegetables. Much of the taste of this traditional country food is determined by the food preservation methods used; brine, drying, and the maturing of meat and fish, called r√¶stkj√∏t and r√¶stur fiskur.J√≥an Pauli Joensen ‚Äì Nye og traditionelle tr√¶k i f√¶r√∏sk madkultur (PDF, Danish) Animal products dominate Faroese cuisine. Popular taste has developed, however, to become closer to the European norm, and consumption of vegetables has greatly increased in recent decades while consumption of fish has diminished. Fresh and r√¶st lamb meat remains very popular while traditional meat products, such as various types of sausages, have lost much of their appeal with younger generations.  Types of food  = Fish = Faroese dry fish Fish dishes in the Faroe Islands are caught in the waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. Fresh fish can be had all year round. Islanders eat mostly haddock, plaice, halibut, herring, and shrimp. = Meat = R√¶stkj√∏t hanging outside a drying shed Traditionally the main source of meat was the domestic sheep, the most common farm animal in the Faroe Islands. However, sheep were also used for their wool. The most popular treat is skerpikj√∏t, well-aged, wind-dried mutton which is quite chewy. The drying shed, known as a hjallur, is a standard feature in many Faroese homes, particularly in the small towns and villages. Other traditional foods are r√¶st kj√∏t (semi-dried mutton) and r√¶stur fiskur, matured fish. = Game = Small game in the Faroe Islands consists mostly of seabirds. = Whale meat and blubber = Traditional dish consisting of dried pilot whale meat (the black meat), blubber (in the center) which has been brined, cooked cold potatoes, and dried fish Another Faroese specialty is tv√∏st og spik, pilot whale meat, and blubber. The meat and the blubber can be preserved and prepared in different ways. Often it is cut into long thin slices, which are called likkja (grindalikkja) in singular and likkjur (grindalikkjur) in plural, and hung up to dry. These are often used for the so-called kalt bor√∞ (cold table) which is a table with a variety of cold Faroese and foreign dishes. The Faroese dishes can consist of whale meat, whale blubber, dried fish, and dried lamb meat, which is called skerpikj√∏t. The kalda bor√∞i√∞ (cold table) is used for festive occasions. Whale meat can also be boiled or, less traditionally, fried as steaks. There are also two ways of salting the whale meat: in dry salt or in salted water (saltlaka√∞ grind). Boiled potatoes are normally eaten together with the whale meat and the blubber, but this tradition is not very old, since potatoes were not common in the Faroe Islands before sometime in the early or mid-19th century.Heimabeiti.fo, N√¶r komu eplini til F√∏roya The pilot whale has been polluted by toxins in the Atlantic Ocean and both Faroese and foreign scientists have researched the quality of the whale meat and the effect it might have on people who consume it. Department of Occupational Medicine and Public Health with Dr. P√°l Weihe and international scientists like P. Grandjean have performed several years of research on the effect of mercury and polychlorinated biphenyl contamination of the pilot whale. Research has been made since 1977 in the Faroe Islands and has led to dietary recommendations regarding the consumption of pilot whale and blubber. Some years ago his advice was that Faroese people should not eat whale meat more than once a month at the most. He later changed his recommendations and, together with H√∏gni Debes Joensen, chief medical officer of the Faroes, said that he would not recommend whale meat or blubber for human consumption at all. However, the Faroese government has not forbidden the whale drives. The Heilsufr√∏√∞iliga Starvsstovan or \\"Faroese Food and Veterinary Agency\\" consulted foreign scientists and issued a new recommendation in 2011. They say that people can eat whale meat and blubber once a month at the most. At the same time they reported that the kidneys and the liver of the whale are so contaminated with mercury, PCB, and dioxin that they are not recommended for human consumption at all. They also recommend that women who wish to become pregnant should refrain from eating blubber, and that women who are pregnant or about to become pregnant should not eat whale meat either.Aktuelt.fo, \\"Kunnu eta grind einafer√∞ um m√°na√∞in\\" (in Faroese, it means: can eat whale meat and blubber once a month) = Beer = The oldest brewery in the Faroes is called F√∂roya Bj√≥r. It has produced beer since 1888, with exports mainly to Iceland and Denmark. It was originally located in Klaksv√≠k, but after buying and merging with Restorff's Bryggjar√≠ in T√≥rshavn, F√∏roya Bj√≥r is now located in the capital. The beer brewery Okkara was established in 2010, located in Velbasta√∞ur. Hard alcohol like snaps was not allowed to be produced in the Faroe Islands until 2011, hence the Faroese aquavit, Aqua Vita, and other kind of alcoholic beverages like Eldvatn and Havi√∞, made by the Faroese company DISM, were produced abroad. But in May 2011 the Faroese government made a new law which allowed Faroese breweries and distilleries to brew strong beer and alcohol. DISM was established in 2008; the company is better known by the name of their first product, L√≠vsins Vatn. = Imported foods = Since the friendly British occupation, the Faroese have been fond of British food, in particular fish and chips and British-style chocolate such as Cadbury Dairy Milk, which is found in many of the islands' shops. Even though there are twice as many sheep in the Faroe Islands as there are people, fresh lamb meat is not usually available in the supermarkets. The only lamb meat which can be found in the supermarkets comes from Iceland or New Zealand. Most of the sheep belong to families, and they have only enough for themselves and do not sell it to others. Some farmers with larger stocks of sheep can be found around the islands, and they sell the meat for private people in the Faroes, to restaurants or supermarkets, but mostly the meat for the supermarkets is dried mutton, not fresh meat. There are no pigs in the Faroe Islands, but pork is quite popular, so it is imported, mostly from Denmark. Some farmers have cattle, but it is mainly dairy cattle. Veal is imported. Chicken and turkey are also imported. Most food in the supermarket is imported from other countries. Milk and yoghurt are produced in the Faroes and sold in the supermarkets, but cheese is imported. Fruit and vegetables are imported from various countries. Sometimes one can buy Faroese-grown potatoes and rutabaga in the super markets. Eggs are imported from Denmark and Sweden. The Faroe Islands imported more than a half billion (526,603,000) DKK in 2011 of foods, beverages, and tobacco.Hagstova.fo (Faroese statistics)  See also  *Faroe Islands domestic animals *Danish cuisine  References  * ","title":"Faroese cuisine"},{"id":"26681525","text":"Kunga Lekpa (, 1433‚Äì1483) was a King of central Tibet who ruled from 1448 to 1481. He belonged to the Phagmodrupa Dynasty, which was the leading political regime in central Tibet from 1354 to 1435, and retained a certain political status until the early 17th century. His time saw the further fragmentation of Tibetan politics. Early years Kunga Lekpa was a son of Sangye Gyaltsen, a brother of the last effective ruler of the dynasty, Gongma Drakpa Gyaltsen. His mother was Dzompama, a lady of the important Rinpungpa family. During the reign of his brother Drakpa Jungne (1432‚Äì1445), the central power of the Phagmodrupa broke down, and the Rinpungpa lord Norzang (d. 1466) acquired a leading position in the Tsang region (West Central Tibet). When Drakpa Jungne died in 1445, there was a three-year interregnum. The young Kunga Lekpa was elevated to abbot of the Tsethang monastery in 1446, and was eventually enthroned as king (gongma, \\"the high one\\") in 1448 by a council of ministers. He resided in the N√™dong palace in √ú (East Central Tibet) with Konchok Rinchen as his chief deputy.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa, Tibet. A Political History. Yale 1967, p. 87. Conflicting Tibetan and Chinese accounts His father Sangye Gyaltsen was still alive, and resided in the Tsethang monastery. He only died in 1457. But in the Mingshi or Chinese dynastic annals the succession is given differently than in the Tibetan chronicles. They assert that the father Sangerjie Jianzan Ba Cangbu (Sangye Gyaltsen Pal Zangpo) succeeded Drakpa Jungne, and ruled in his own name until 1469. After the latter's death the Chenghua Emperor would have \\"ordered\\" his son Gongge Liesiba Zhongnai Lingzhan Jianzan Baer Cangbu (Kunga Lekpa Jungne Rinchen Gyaltsen Pal Zangpo) to accede to the throne.Giuseppe Tucci, Tibetan Painted Scrolls. Rome 1949, Vol. II, p. 693. The historiographical discrepancy is not easily explained, and seems to point to the limited Chinese insights in Tibetan affairs. At any rate the princely title (wang) conferred by the Chenghua Emperor was valued enough by the Tibetan elite to merit a mention in the local chronicles.Giuseppe Tucci, Deb T'er Dmar Po Gsar Ma. Rome 1971, p. 222. Trouble with the Rinpungpa Kunga Lekpa made a tour in Tsang, where his Rinpungpa kinsman Norzang received him in state. However, the king felt dissatisfied with the treatment accorded him. He was married to the Rinpungpa lady Chopel Zangmo, his cousin, but the marriage was unhappy, and caused serious political repercussions. To this was added religiously tainted disputes. Norzang's grandson Donyo Dorje (1463‚Äì1512) was a supporter of the Karmapa sect and insisted on building a monastery outside Lhasa, thus within the orbit of Phagmodru authority. However, hostile Gelugpa monks razed the new establishment and almost killed the Karmapa lama Ch√∂drak Gyatso. Finally, in 1480, Donyo Dorje invaded the √ú region and captured some districts which had hitherto been under Phagmodrupa's control. He also forced the deputy Konchok Rinchen from power. A renewed attack in the next year was unsuccessful, but by now Kunga Lekpa had lost much of his allegiance among the Tibetan elite. The ministers of the kingdom met in the same year 1481 in N√™dong to discuss the conflict between the gongma's faction and the Rinpungpa. In the end Kunga Lekpa was deposed and received an estate as compensation.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa, 1967, p. 87-8. The throne went to his nephew Ngagi Wangpo.The date of Ngagi Wangpo's accession is sometimes given as 1454; see Dang-dkar blo-bzang 'phrim-las, The Merging of Religious and Secular Rule in Tibet. Beijing 1991, p. 59. This, however, was rather his appointment as abbot; see George N. Roerich, The Blue Annals. Delhi 1976, p. 595. Two years after this, the old ruler died. He had a son called Rinchen Dorje (1458?-1476?) who became abbot of Tsethang in 1467, but died at a young age. He is sometimes listed as ruler after Kunga Lekpa, which appears to be incorrect.List of rulers in Sarat Chandra Das, 'Contributions on the religion, history &c;, of Tibet', Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal 1881, p. 242. The list is taken over by some later works, such as A.M.H.J. Stokvis, Manuel d'histoire, de g√©n√©alogie et de chronologie de tous l'√©tats du globe, Vol. I. The Hague 1888.

Early life As a young woman Jann Freeman led a glamorous life a world away from the safe suburban upbringing she had enjoyed in Brisbane. Her striking beauty almost destined her for a career in modelling and acting, and at one time she performed on the stage with actors such as Barry Otto and John Stanton in the pioneering days of Brisbane theatre. She had trained as a librarian after graduating from All Hallows School in 1955, but became involved in a succession of beauty pageants in the 1950s including the Miss Australia Quest. Her second cousin was etiquette and modelling luminary June Dally Watkins. Career Then, in 1961, like so many other young Australians at the time, she travelled to the United Kingdom to make her fortune. She spurned lodging at the Australian expat enclave of Earls Court, opting to live in the theatrical area Gerards Cross. Her neighbours and friends included Margaret Rutherford, the British character actress best known for her portrayal of Miss Marple. After turning her back on the catwalk and the stage she worked in a number of high-powered jobs with Hallmark Cards, Schweppes and IBM, where she handled public relations, before landing the plum position of publicity at Australia House. Part of the job description involved planning functions and entertaining VIP guests, which on one memorable occasion in 1963 included The Beatles. The eldest of bank manager James Maguire Freeman and Clarice Maud Freeman's four children had come a long way. Married life But during her time in London she met a handsome young Dutchman on a blind date, Albert (Appie) Knijnenburg, something which was to see her return to Australia and begin a new career as a suburban mum. Appie was training as an engineer in those days . Jann fell in love with him . They were engaged within weeks. While meeting Appie's parents in the Netherlands the couple learned that if they were married for a year they would be eligible for a migration bonus designed to lure Europeans to Australia. So, discussing the matter, they decided to immediately marry in Appie's home town Wassenaar. Upon returning to London and their separate apartments, they went back to their old jobs until they could arrange a big church wedding. Australia The Knijnenburgs then set sail for Brisbane aboard the liner Aurelia, arriving in 1965. The first of four sons, Johannes (Hans), soon arrived on the scene, followed in quick succession by David and Nicholas. Despite the challenges of caring for three children under the age of three, and the cultural shock of adjusting to life as a suburban Brisbane mum, she embarked on what became a lifelong fascination with antiques. At the time of her death Jann was well known and respected as an expert in various areas of antiques including jewellery, porcelain and dolls. Life was almost perfect, marred only by the heartbreaking loss of several babies until a fourth boy, Michael, was born in 1974 at the height of the devastating Brisbane floods. Jann had been raised as a Catholic and later in life became heavily involved with the church. She put her Christian ideals into practice by taking dozens of troubled individuals under her wing. Later life and death In her last years Jann contracted pseudomyxoma peritonei, a rare and incurable abdominal cancer. Undeterred, after she was diagnosed she and Appie decided to make the most of their remaining time together and went on a series of cruises, travelling to Tasmania, New Zealand and the Pacific islands. They stopped only when it became clear that Jann would be unable to make any more journeys. Jann also maintained her interest in the arts, recording a voice-over for a short film just weeks before she died.The Courier Mail 15 March 2010, p55 (Obituary for Jann Knijnenburg 'A role model for life') References Category:1938 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Australian stage actresses Category:Actresses from Brisbane Category:People educated at All Hallows' School ","title":"Jann Knijnenburg"},{"id":"26681631","text":"The Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA; )http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/media.nsf/content/SelectedPressRelease?OpenDocument&UNID;=4E9F42888CF2E325852576B800553E5A is the emerging central bank of Palestine.

The museum was founded in 1974 with purchase of the museum ship Oscar Huber. In 1998 the museum was moved from the old town hall into the city's former indoor swimming facility, an Art Nouveau landmark which had been built in 1910, closed in 1986, and declared a protected historic site in 1988.\\"The history of the museum\\", Duisburg am Rhein official city website (accessed 2014-06-13). The move allowed the museum the space to exhibit complete ships, as well as spurring redevelopment in the harbor area.

It is a former Anglican parish church which is now redundant and under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church was built between 1837 and 1846 at a cost of ¬£5,019 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). It was a Commissioners' church, receiving a grant of ¬£1,519 towards its cost from the Church Building Society. The church was designed by the Lancaster architect Edmund Sharpe, the project being instigated by the Rev J. W. Whittaker, Sharpe's cousin and the vicar of Blackburn. The foundation stone was laid on 11 October 1837 by Rev John Bird Sumner, then the Bishop of Chester. It opened for worship in January 1846, and was consecrated on 12 July of that year. The church provided seating for 1,626 people. The completion of the tower was delayed due to lack of funds until 1853, and the intended spire was never built. In 1860 internal alterations were carried out under the direction of E. G. Paley, Sharpe's successor in the practice. The galleries were reconstructed and new stalls were added, providing 200 more seats. The organ was removed to a position behind the pulpit. These alterations cost over ¬£1,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). Between 1942 and 1949 the vicar of the church was Chad Varah, who later founded The Samaritans. In 1946 the side galleries were removed, retaining the west gallery. Holy Trinity was declared redundant on 1 April 1981, and was vested in the Trust on 18 May 1984. Architecture =Exterior= Holy Trinity is designed in Gothic Revival style. Its plan consists of a three-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south lean-to aisles, north and south transepts rising to the full height of the nave, and a chancel. The tower has three stages, with lancet windows in the lower stages and two twin-light Louvre style bell openings on each side in the top stage. At the summit is a plain parapet with a pinnacle at each corner. All the windows are tall. At the east ends of the transepts and the chancel, the window arrangement is unusual, consisting of 2-3-2 lights, a feature more commonly found in Germany. =Interior= Internally there are slim compound piers and a west gallery. The ceiling is flat and divided into 80 panels by moulded ribs. Each of the panels contains a painting of a coat of arms. At the centre of the crossing are the royal coat of arms of Queen Victoria. Elsewhere are the arms of the other monarchs, going back to Edward the Confessor, bishops and other churchmen (including Whittaker), and William Whewell (one of Sharpe's patrons). The painters employed included William Birch, Benjamin West, John Brocklehurst and Samuel Driver. The organ was moved from Hanover Square Rooms, London. It was rebuilt and restored by Gray and Davidson in 1851 and installed in the west gallery. At a later date it was moved to the southeast of the chancel and rebuilt. In 1937 it was rebuilt again and enlarged by Laycock and Bannister of Keighley. Assessment The church was designated as a Grade II listed church on 13 May 1987. It is Sharpe's largest and grandest church. Sharpe's biographer, John Hughes, describes it as his pi√®ce de r√©sistance.

Situated centrally amidst Palestine, Syria, Babylon, Levant, and other Mesopotamian city-states, Mari acted as the ‚Äúmiddle-man‚Äù to these larger, powerful kingdoms. Both the size and grand nature of the palace demonstrate the importance of Mari during its long history, though the most intriguing feature of the palace is the nearly 25,000 tablets found within the palace rooms. The royal palace was discovered in 1935, excavated with the rest of the city throughout the 1930s, and is considered one of the most important finds made at Mari.Kuhrt, 1997, p.102. Andr√© Parrot led the excavations and was responsible for the discovery of the city and the palace. Thousands of clay tablets were discovered through the efforts of Andr√© Bianquis, who provided archaeologists the tools to learn about, and to understand, everyday life at the palace in Mari.Parrot, 1955, pg. 24-5. The discovery of the tablets also aided in the labeling of various rooms in terms of their purpose and function.Burney, 1977, pg. 92-3. Overview The palace reached its grandest state with its last renovation under king Zimri-Lim in the 18th century BC; in addition to serving as the home of the royal family, the palace would have also housed royal guards, state workers, members of the military, and those responsible for the daily activities of the kingdom. The apartments of the king were well separated from the rest of the palace and relatively simple to identify when Parrot led the excavations. While most rooms in the palace were interconnected and allowed access to one another, the private quarters of the royal family were very isolated. Parrot emphasized the amount of privacy afforded the king and his family, as well as the maximum level of security that was maintained through the architecture of the building. An entry gate was the only access point of the large palace complex, thus providing added security. The layout of the palace was also built with the security of the royal family in mind. A central court was surrounded by a series of smaller rooms. Entryways to courtyards were positioned in such a way as to make any attacks on those within the courtyard nearly impossible. Such architectural features did not allow any visitor to peer directly into one of the open courts, but forced a visitor to change direction and enter on the side of the court; anyone wishing to use a weapon would not have been able to directly access any room inside of the main gateway. The royal palace at Mari was decorated with frescoes and statues. Decoration different depending on the function of the room. Religious and royal scenes were placed in public areas, where the message of kingship and religion could easily be viewed by visitors and residents of the palace. More private rooms, like the royal apartments, were decorated with patterns, shapes, and geometric designs. Designs in the royal apartments would have added to the luxurious accommodations befitting the royal family, while the representational frescoes would have demonstrated luxury, power, and authority. Archaeological finds =Statues= Statues of gods and past rulers were the most common among statues unearthed at the Palace of Zimri- Lin. The title of Shakkanakku (military governor) was borne by all the princes of a dynasty who reigned at Mari in the late third millennium and early second millennium BC. These kings were the descendants of the military governors appointed by the kings of Akkad.Louvre. \\"The Statuette of Iddi-Ilum,\\" Department of Near Eastern Antiquities: Mesopotamia. Accessed December 1, 2014. http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/statuette-iddi-ilum Statues and sculpture were used to decorate the exterior and interior of the palace. Zimri-Lin used these statues to connect his kingship to the gods and to the traditions of past rulers. Most notable of these statues are the statue of Iddi-Ilum, Ishtup-Ilum, the Statue of the Water Goddess, and Puzur-Ishtar. Puzur-Ishtar The Statue of Puzur-Ishtar, Former Governor of Mari The statue of Puzur-Ishtar once stood in one of the sanctuaries of the Palace of Zimri-Lim, but was discovered in the museum of Nebuchadrezzar‚Äôs palace at Babylon (604-562 B.C.E). The inscription on the hem of the statue‚Äôs skirt mentions Puzur-Ishtar, sakkanakku of Mari, and also mentions his brother the priest Milaga.Gates, Henriette-Marie. \\"The Palace of Zimri-Lim at Mari.\\" The Biblical Archaeologist 47 (June.,1984): 70-87. Horned caps are usually limited to divine representations in Mesopotamian art but they do not occur on depictions of kings during the Ur III period, therefore it is considered that perhaps the horns of divinity on Puzur-Ishtar‚Äôs cap qualified him (to the Babylonian soldiers) as a god to be carted home as the ultimate symbol of their victory over the people of Mari.Gates, \\"The Palace of Zimri-Lim at Mari,\\" 70-87. Ishtup-Ilum The Statue of Ishtup-Ilum is made of basalt and was found in room 65 of the palace. The inscription on his shoulder identifies this man as a governor (sakkanakku) of Mari during the early second millennium B.C.E. Ishtup-Ilum was known for his lavish gifts to the Ishtar temple, the temple of the popular goddess of fertility, love, war, and sex. The height of the statue is 1.52 meters. The statue is now in the Aleppo Museum. Iddi-Ilum The Statue of Iddi-Ilum Iddi-Ilum was a former sakkanakku of Mari. This statue portrays Iddi-Ilum as a religious ruler, for his hands are clasped in front of him in the typical Mesopotamian pose of prayer. His luxurious robe has a tasseled border and is wound around his body, contrary to Mesopotamian tradition. The statuette bears an inscription in Akkadian: ‚ÄúIddi-Ilum, shakkanakku of Mari, has dedicated his statue to Inanna. Whosoever erases this inscription will have his line wiped out by Inanna.‚Äù Connections can be made between this statuette and the statue of Puzur-Ishtar, also shakkanakku of Mari, by virtue of the trimmed beard and rich garments.Louvre. \\"Statuette of Iddi-Ilum,\\" Department of Near Eastern Antiquities: Mesopotamia.

Many of the recovered tablets have been identified as either the remains of the royal epistolary archive of Mari, other administrative documents, and the Kings letters to his wives which were found in the women's quarters. Some letters include direct quotes from King Hammurabi leading us to believe that they were contemporaneous with his rule.Wolfgang, p.4 Other letters shed light on divinity at Mari and in the ancient Near East.

The painting is distinguished in part by its wide range of color, including green and blue. Painted on a thin layer of mud plaster applied directly to the palace's brick wall, the scene features a warrior goddess, likely Ishtar, giving Zimri-Lim a ring and a staff, the symbols of kingship. The continuation of the red and blue painted border of the panel suggests that it was one of several adorning the walls of the room. Recent restoration efforts by the Louvre have revealed previously unseen details, such as scalloping on Zimri-Lim's robe, and unexpectedly vibrant colors, such as a brilliantly orange bull. Sacrifical procession scene Fragments of a sacrificial procession scene were found at the base of the eastern half of the same wall on which \\"The Investiture of Zimri-Lim\\" was recovered. The painting has multiple registers and depicts a life-size figure leading men who are in turn leading a procession of sacrificial animals. The colors utilized are black, brown, red, white, and gray. The application technique of this scene differs from the thin mud plaster used as a base for other frescoes in the palace. The sacrificial procession scene utilized layered mud, which was scored to aid attachment to a top layer of thick gypsum plaster. The presence of both frescoes in the same room and the better preservation of the \\"Investiture\\" scene could mean that \\"Investiture\\" was an earlier painting, and that the concealing of this fresco by the later procession scene is what saved it from suffering the same degree of damage as the palace's other frescoes. \\"Audience chamber\\" frescoes A number of wall-painting fragments were also discovered in from the south- western end of narrow room that Parrot dubbed the \\"king's audience chamber.\\" These fragments were restored to a size of 2.8 meters (nearly ten feet) in height and 3.35 meters (nearly eleven feet) in width. The paintings include two major registers, each depicting a scene in which offerings are made to deities. The scenes are framed by mythological creatures and bordered top and bottom by striding men carrying bundles on their backs. The figures are outlined with thick black line, with red, gray, brown, yellow, and white pigments utilized throughout the painting. Other fragmentary images Painting fragments found in the same room as the \\"Investiture of Zimri-Lim\\" and the sacrificial procession scene include goats in heraldic pose flanking a tree, a life-size figure with a dagger in his belt, a figure in front of an architectural background, and a hand grasping hair in a manner very similar to the traditional Egyptian scene of a king smiting an enemy with a mace. Others rooms yielded very fragmentary wall paintings, which may have fallen and broken partly as a result of the collapse of an upper story. The fragments fall into two general stylistic groups: figures resembling the bundle-bearing men in the \\"audience chamber\\" frescoes, and life-size figures bearing similarity to the sacrificial procession scene.

He scored on his only appearance for the England amateur national team. Derby County Frederick G. Wheatcroft was born in Alfreton, Derbyshire in 1882. He started his football career with his hometown club, the original Alfreton Town club before moving to Division One side Derby County in 1903. The centre forward found opportunities within the first team limited mainly due to the prolific goalscoring exploits of Steve Bloomer. In 1904 he joined Swindon Town as an amateur but soon rejoined Derby County before venturing to Wiltshire again in 1905. After a brief spell with Fulham Wheatcroft returned to County for his final spell where he clocked up 20 appearances, scoring 4 goals. Swindon Town Wheatcroft left Derby for Berkshire outfit Reading but soon returned to Swindon Town in 1909. It was during this spell that Freddie Wheatcroft enjoyed his longest spell and best work as a footballer. He scored 22 times in 38 appearances throughout the 1909/10 campaign. His career was halted by the outbreak of the First World War. The Great War Like many other British males, Wheatcroft answered his nation's call and enlisted to fight during World War I. He was conscripted into the East Surrey Regiment as private in May 1916 and 12 months later had risen to the rank of second lieutenant. Wheatcroft was killed in action in Bourlon on 26 November 1917 while conducting a retreat during the Battle of Cambrai and is buried in Anneux Military Cemetery.

It is noteworthy as the earliest of Cicero's published speeches to survive. Background The speech is a private legal case, centred around the business relationship between Gaius Quinctius and Sextus Naevius. The two were close partners (socii) for many years, with Naevius even marrying Gaius' cousin. Their chief investments were in cattle farms and land in Gallia Narbonensis.C. D. Yonge, The Orations of Marcus Tullius Cicero, Vol. 1., London, 1856; Johannes Platschek, Studien zu Ciceros Rede f√ºr P. Quinctius (Munich, 2005) = Death of Gaius Quinctius = When Gaius died suddenly in ca. 84 BC, he left his brother, Publius Quinctius, as his heir. Publius also inherited Gaius' outstanding debts, and intended to sell some of his own private property to pay them off. However, Naevius convinced him not to do so, and offered to advance the money required. The amount Publius was to pay was settled in Rome by Gaius Aquilius, a noteworthy iudex.J. H. Freese, Cicero: the Speeches (London, 1930), pp. 2‚Äì8. When Publius Quinctius came to pay the debts, Naevius refused to grant the promised money until they had settled various unresolved issues about the partnership in Gaul. As a result, Publius was forced to sell his private property after all. The two now agreed to a vadimonium (a settlement in the courts), apparently to settle the terms of the partnership's dissolution.Cicero, pro Quinctio 22 At this vadimonium, Naevius announced that he had unilaterally sold part of the partnership's jointly owned property, and that he no longer considered there to be any unresolved issues: he then invited Publius to call another vadimonium in objection, but Publius declined. As a result, the two parties left without any agreement to appear in court again (at least according to Cicero's narrative of events).Cicero, pro Quinctio 14‚Äì24J. H. Freese, Cicero: the Speeches (London, 1930), pp. 2‚Äì8. = Violent Dispute = However, matters soon turned violent. On 29 January 83 BC, Publius set off from Rome for Gaul, accompanied with some slaves he intended to sell there. Hearing of this, Naevius quickly gathered a number of friends, and (according to Cicero) pretended that a vadimonium had been called. With these friends as witnesses, he announced that Publius had failed to attend the vadimonium: as a result, he was able to obtain an edict from a praetor, Burrienus, announcing Publius as a defaulting debtor, and granting Naevius permission to seize his property.Cicero, pro Quinctio 24‚Äì26 Naevius' men attempted to seize the slaves Publius was planning to sell, but Publius' agent Alfenus prevented this by tearing down the placard announcing Burrienus' edict. However, when Publius arrived in Gaul a few days later, Naevius' men successfully ejected him from his property and forcibly seized the land.A. Lintott, Cicero as Evidence (Oxford, 2008), p. 51 = Sponsio = A number of appeals and disagreements followed over the next two years, including an attempted intervention on Publius‚Äô behalf by the ex-consul and governor of Gallia Transalpina, Gaius Valerius Flaccus. Eventually, in 81 BC a praetor, Gnaeus Dolabella, forced Publius to enter a judicial wager (sponsio), in which Publius would try to establish that his property had not been seized according to Burrienus' edict. The judge for the trial was Gaius Aquilius, the same jurist who had handled the initial stages of the case. Publius initially chose a Marcus Junius as his representative, but at the last minute had to hire the young Cicero, aged only 25, as replacement.Cicero, pro Quinctio 3Aulus Gellius, Attic Nights 15.28 In contrast, Naevius hired the experienced Quintus Hortensius, by then the foremost orator in Rome: in addition, Hortensius was aided by Lucius Marcius Philippus, a former consul and one of the most influential members of Sulla's regime.J. H. Freese, Cicero: the Speeches (London, 1930), p. 8. Although it is Cicero's earliest surviving speech, it was not his first appearance as an advocate, as he makes a number of references throughout to earlier cases he had undertaken. The speech = Cicero's argument = As per the terms of the sponsio, Cicero's speech focusses on whether Publius Quinctius' lands were lawfully seized according to the terms of Burrienus' edict. The speech is divided into three main arguments: 1.) Naevius should not have applied to Burrienus for the edict: firstly, because Publius owed Naevius no money; and secondly, because the additional vadimonium, which Naevius claimed Publius had failed to attend, was in fact never arranged at all. 2.) Naevius' possession of Publius' property cannot be 'in accordance with' Burrienus' edict, because none of the edict's conditions applied to Publius. 3.) given that the time between Naevius' application for the edict in Rome (20 February 83 BC) and his seizure of Publius' lands in Gaul (23 February) was so short, he must have treacherously pre-planned the event. Throughout the speech, Cicero focusses on the influence, power, and arrogance of Naevius and his supporters. In contrast to the nefarious Naevius, Cicero emphasises the pitiable position of Publius Quinctius, whom he characterises as an honest, hardworking farmer, treacherously deprived of his familial property by a man who was meant to be his friend and partner. Given that Rome was in the midst of Sulla's dictatorship and the proscriptions, Cicero also takes the opportunity to highlight the general lawlessness and insecurity of the times, but falls short of criticising Sulla directly.A. Vasaly, 'Cicero's early speeches', in J.M. May (ed.), Brill's Companion to Cicero (Leiden, 2002), pp. 72‚Äì76 He was to take a similar approach in his next major speech, the pro Roscio Amerino of 80 BC. =Outcome= The result of the case is unknown. However, some scholars suggest that Cicero may have won, as he was unlikely to publish the speech so early in his career had it been a failure.E.g. A.

The anion is a transition metal complex consisting of an iron atom in the +3 oxidation state and three bidentate oxalate ions anions acting as ligands. The ferrioxalate anion is sensitive to light and higher-energy electromagnetic radiation, which causes the decomposition of one oxalate to carbon dioxide and reduction of the iron(III) atom to iron(II).

It is not appreciably soluble in ethanol or ethanol water mixtures which are more than 50% ethanol by mass. It is somewhat more soluble in water than the corresponding potassium salt.

The manga sets during the civil war in Japan and revolves around a boy named Raizou Katana who is loathed for having a short horn on his forehead. He saves a female ninja, who then tells him that she's his servant and he is an emperor, and she introduces him to her clan of female ninjas who are devoted to restoring his family name. Plot The story revolves around a boy named Raizou Katana. He was living in a village where the villagers despised him for having a horn on his head. When he saves the life of Kagari (a kunoichi), he discovers that he is the illegitimate heir to the fallen Katana clan and must revive his household to its original state. Together with fellow Kunoichi Kisarabi and Himemaru, they set out to revive the clan by marrying Raizou to a princess of another household and borrowing their power. Throughout the series, Raizo eventually wins over several princesses but ends up running away due to various misunderstandings. All the while, a group led by the mysterious Kabuki Seigan also attempt to gain control over the other households, only to meet with failure through the intervention of Raizou and his followers. Characters ; :A young boy born with a small horn on his head, which identifies him as the heir of the Katana household. Due to his horn, he has been treated as an outcast for most of his life. ; :A Kunoichi devoted to the restoration of the Katana household. She can use the special technique Shintaigo, which makes her body as tough as steel and grants her super strength provided the man she loves is watching her. She seems to hold great feelings for Raizou. ; :The second kunoichi working for Raizou to rebuild the Katana household and the apparent leader of the trio. She is a very serious woman, skilled in the use of a variety of firearms and possesses the special technique Rasengan, which allows her to increases her already formidable sniping abilities. Her house revival plan involves having Raizou marry a princess of a powerful house in order to use that house's power to destroy their enemies. ; :The third kunoichi, in actuality a crossdresser who gave up the life of a Samurai because it was too demanding. He uses a shibari technique called Higyaku no Shibari, which wraps ropes around the target in a way that makes it painful to move. He also dabbles in medicine (to be precise poisons) and can control people using music. Although initially wanting to marry Raizou in order to gain wealth and fame, he was soon charmed by him. His house revival plan involves seducing other lords in order to make them submit to the Katana household. ;Mother :Raizo's deceased mother, who communicates with her son through her mortuary tablet, often showing disapproval by falling on or striking him, or satisfaction through a gleam.

The following week, Ninja Girls volume 1 slipped to eighth position. Joseph Luster, writing for Otaku USA, felt that the manga was in an awkward position: \\"too fan-servicey for some, and not enough for others\\". Comicbookbin.com's Leroy Douresseaux compares the tone of the manga to Strawberry 100%, and feels that the manga is full of \\"comic violence that is brutal and bloody or innuendo defined by female ninja (kunoichi) in some state of undress.\\" Activeanime.com's Davey C. Jones enjoyed the \\"voluptuous\\" character designs of the girls. Matthew Alexander found the character of the spirit tablet imbued with the protagonist's mother's spirit to be very funny, and found the protagonist to be a \\"likeable character\\" who \\"cares more about the feelings of those around him than he does about his own wellbeing\\". Dan Polley felt the first volume had \\"potential\\", and that the secondary characters were intriguing.

In 2000 he opened an exhibition house in Siegen (Gero-Trauth-Haus).Laudationes by Dietrich Mattausch, Prof. Dr. Fritz B. Simon and Klaus Gerdes  Illustrations on porcelain  In 1984 he began what was to be an extremely successful partnership with Villeroy&Boch;/Heinrich‚ÄìPorzellan in Selb which ended in 1997. During this time Trauth left his mark decisively on the range of products. The exclusive table settings and dinnerware were looked after by Trauth and Paloma Picasso whose objet d‚Äôart (collectors‚Äô piece) ‚ÄúPaloma Picasso-Suite de Vase‚Äù was decorated by Trauth. Moreover, he designed bone china dinner services (Vie Sauvage, Arabian Fantasy und Happy Seasons). Numerous articles show his style, among others the exclusive objet d‚Äôart (collectors‚Äô piece) ‚ÄúMagnum‚Äù (1990). Trauth also created series of porcelain for the WWF (Symbiose Mensch ‚Äì Natur, 1990) and the German Cancer Research (Deutsche Krebshilfe; (Tr√§umereien, 1995). Moreover, series of Russian fairy tale motifs (Zauberm√§rchen aus dem Alten Ru√üland, M√§rchen der Wolga, Die Tr√§ume der Katharina) were created as well as other series (Zauberwelt der Manege, Liebespaare der Weltliteratur), annual Christmas plates, which were presented in Europe (Internationale Frankfurter Messen) and in the USA (Southbend-Fair, Chicago), V&B;, Madison Avenue, New York.  Cappella Gero Trauth  In 2003 the new exhibition showroom Cappella Gero Trauth was designed by Trauth. It stands for the symbiosis of works from the world literature and Trauth‚Äôs art works and is thought to be a refuge for his collectors.March 26, 2006, TV stations ZDF and 3Sat: Ausflug ins Reich der Poesie - Die Cappella Gero Trauth: ‚ÄúA marble hall of extraordinary architecture and beauty‚Äù 2005 : Vernissage and exhibition of water-color graphics on Heinrich Heine‚Äôs Buch der Lieder (Book of Songs, 1827)Laudationes at the vernissage (March 12, 2005) by Prof. Dr. Fritz B.

Every day objects like a bicycle and a bottle, and also a propeller are put in a new context and form the base of the sound design. They lose their conventional function consequently and have to be considered as indispensable parameters of this instrument.\\"\\"New Tendencies in the Digital Music Instrument Design: Progress Report\\", p.273-74. smc2009.smcnetwork.org. It was developed by Daniel Dominguez Teruel from 2007‚Äì2009 and built with the support of Chiron-Werke GmbH & Co. KG. cycleonium The physical and mechanical work that is required to make this sound-machine sound basically doesn‚Äôt differ from traditional musical instruments. For instance, a guitar: it sounds, respectively do we perceive it acoustically, if the strings are excited or the corpus is oscillated somehow or other. So the player expends energy and translates it into the instrument. The user and viewer of the cycleonium is to be made aware of that, in principle, musical instruments are nothing else than objects that only operate with a certain energy expenditure. The energy flow that is emerged thereby plays here a primary role. Therefore we use the word fluxus, but more in a semantically significance (lat. flux, fluidum = flow) than artistic aesthetics. Any kind of sounds require energy to sound. They have self-energy indeed, but it first has to be excited. Otherwise every sound is only a sounding abstraction (they aren‚Äôt a perpetual motion machine) that we don't hear. The player of the cycleonium produces, amongst others, kinetic energy that excites a propeller that simultaneously blows air on the aperture of a bottle: a pitched sound is audible. Description cycleonium \\"The cycleonium consists basically of four pieces: a bicycle (...), a bottle and a propeller that form the hardware and a computer for software-based sound processing (live-electronics). The bicycle is rebuilt in such a way that it resembles a stationary bicycle. In this way the propeller can be powered whereby the emerging air flow hits the angle of the aperture of the bottle. Likewise in a flute, a periodical oscillating air column that is perceivable as a tone pitch is produced in the corpus of the bottle [...]. The intensity of the sound depends on the speed of the propeller and consequently on the expended force of the player....The breath of the player and the sound of the chain and arbor of the bicycle are as equally important as the sound of the bottle itself. The produced sounds are amplified and real-time processed. The live-electronics take place in Max/Msp [...] on a Laptop. The sounds can be pitched, transposed, filtered, recorded and played and processed with delay or reverb. Each Parameter can be controlled with a MIDI-controller. The following microphones are used: :bottle: electret microphone :breath: dynamic microphone :chain/arbor: condenser microphone (cardioid) For instance, over the keynote of the bottle can be formed an overtone scale with 15 partials or more that are controllable individually. The spatialization is realized with delays, which can be filtered, pitched and assigned to the respective audio-outputs discretely in real-time [...]. To bring the bottle in the best possible position to the airflow one can adjust it in height, distance and angle to the propeller.\\" Purpose \\"The player perches on it like on a stationary bicycle and starts to pedal. The midi-controller and the Laptop can be put on a tray that is at the height of the handlebar. By using a dynamic microphone that is at the height of the mouth he can experiment with his [sic] voice respectively breath and modify it per MIDI in real-time. The sound of the arbor at the propeller and the chain is recorded with a condenser microphone (cardioid). Through reverse turns of the pedals the sound of chain and arbor becomes more concisely and is at the same time a variation of sound. By alternating forward and reverse turns a percussive rhythmical complement is built to the laminary sound of the bottle that mainly can be modified in the pitch. Dense and complex structures of sound can be achieved by adding overtones, glissandi and delays.\\" From the work with the cycleonium Daniel Dominguez Teruel developed the piece 5 Klangaktionen that was nominated for the competition for electroacoustic music IMEB Bourges 2009. Also in 2009 the cycleonium was presented at the 6th Sound and Music Computing Conference in Porto and the ton:art in Karlsruhe.

It is located in the village of Kilfenora, in the region known as the Burren, County Clare, Ireland. In medieval times it was the episcopal see of the Bishop of Kilfenora. History According to tradition, the ecclesial presence at Kilfenora began with Saint Fachanan, who founded a church here in the 6th century. The first building was probably made of wood and followed by a stone construction. That church was burned down in 1055 by Murchad O'Brien. It was rebuilt between 1056 and 1058, only to be plundered in 1079 and then destroyed by an accidental fire in 1100. In 1152, the Synod of Kells changed the status of the ecclesial settlement here from monastic to diocesan. The diocese corresponded with the ancient territory of Corcomroe., The Province of Munster, p. 500. Kilfenora Cathedral is dedicated to St. Fachtna (also St. Fachanan or St. Fachtnan) and the present structure dates to between 1189 and 1200. It was built in the so- called transitional style with a nave and a chancel. These were later separated and by 1839, \\"thirty-six feet of the east end\\" were roofless. Part of the Archdiocese of Cashel, the diocese only extended over 200 square miles of very thinly populated land. It was reckoned the poorest diocese, with only 13 parishes. Demand for the position of bishop thus was not great, but for 1189 a bishop is recorded. In 1661 Samuel Pullen was made Archbishop of Tuam and Kilfenora became part of his province. The last Bishop of Kilfenora in the succession of the Catholic Church was James Augustine O'Daly (d. 1749). In 1750, the diocese was united with Kilmacduagh. In 1883 \\"Kilfenora and Kilmacduagh\\" was again merged with the diocese of Galway. Today, the bishops of Galway and Kilmacduagh are styled \\"Bishop of Galway and Kilmacduagh and Apostolic Administrator of Kilfenora\\"; while the bishop administers the diocese, in Canon Law, he does so as representative of the Pope. In the Church of Ireland, Kilfenora was merged in turn with the dioceses of Limerick (1606‚Äì07), Tuam (1617-1742), Clonfert (1742-1752), Killaloe (1752-1976) and again Limerick (since 1976). Description Today the church shows \\"a curious mix of styles\\" from a number of periods. The oldest part likely is the north wall of the nave showing (now plaster-covered) cyclopean masonry, this turn- of-the-first-millennium building may have been aisled. One 19th-century visitor was unimpressed by the cathedral's appearance: \\"The attempt at a tower is conspicuously mean and hideous. A pile of emigrants' luggage with a rabbit- hutch or bird-cage overhead would look equally imposing\\". The nave is now used for worship by the Church of Ireland, for which it was reconstructed around 1850. It features a bishop's throne, donated in 1981. There is also a large square stone baptismal font (possibly from around 1200).\\"The Cathedrals of the Church of Ireland\\" Day, J.G.F./ Patton, H.E. p148: London, S.P.C.K., 1932 In addition, the church contains various tombs, but the interior is mostly devoid of ornamentation. The Gothic sedilia in the chancel of Kilfenora Cathedral According to local tradition, the late 12th- to early 13-century chancel was roofed with an oak ceiling (blue with gold start) until the end of the 18th century. It is roofless today and features a 15th-century doorway, a 15th- century Gothic sedilia as well as a Romanesque three-light east window with its triangular pillars topped by carved capitals. On both sides of the window is a carved effigy: a bishop with his right hand raised in blessing (possibly early 14th century), to the north; and a tonsured, bareheaded cleric holding a book (possibly 13th century) to the south. The chancel also contains several tombs and the remains of high crosses. It shares some design features such as the three-lighted decorated east window with other structures from the early 13th century, e.g.Corcomroe Abbey, belonging to the style known as the \\"school of the west\\". One of the tombs is the burial site of Neptune Blood, the uncle of Thomas Blood, who tried to steal the English crown jewels in 1671. Detail of a pillar on the east window in the chancel of Kilfenora Cathedral The \\"Lady Chapel\\" (sacristy or chapter room) was in a rectangular wing leading to the north of the chancel. It likely shares the building date of the main building and may have served as a sort of transept in the past. Two lancet-type windows and a broken two-light one are left in the eastern wall. There are also fragments of a high cross. Today, the cathedral remains in partially ruined state, although restoration work was done by the National Monument Service in the early 2000s. The transept was fitted with a glass roof in 2005 to protect the remains of the three high crosses moved there. Ecclesiastical parish In 1837, the nave portion of the cathedral was adopted for use as the Protestant parish church for Kilfenora.Church of Ireland - Kilfenora parish It is still used for occasional worship. In the Catholic Church, the ecclesiastical parish is merged with the civil parish of Kiltoraght. There are two churches in this parish: St. Fachtna's (in Kilfenora) and St Attracta's (Kiltoraght). The former was built either in the 1840s or in 1917.

This version of the Skanda PurƒÅ·πáa is substantially different from the Skanda PurƒÅ·πáa known from manuscripts and the printed edition in India.For a recent publication, see Yuko Yokochi, The SkandapurƒÅ·πáa III Adhyayas 34.1-61, 53-69: The VindhyavƒÅsinƒ´ Cycle (Leiden, 2013), see http://www.brill.com/products/book/skandapurana-iii. Bakker has continued and expanded the best traditions of Dutch Indology and has trained a number of able scholars, among them Peter Bisschop (Leiden University), Harunaga Isaacson (University of Hamburg) and Yuko Yokochi (University of Kyoto). Bakker is currently working as researcher in \\"Beyond Boundaries: Religion, Region, Language and the State\\", a project based in the British Museum that is funded by the European Research Council.See https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/all_current_projects/beyond_boundaries.aspx.

As a composer he wrote mainly works for chamber ensembles, and his music displays an acute sensitivity to instrumental balance and timbre. In his early career he won the CBC National Radio Competition for Young Composers several times, including in 1978 for both Six Regions for piano (composed 1975) and Spectre for tenor instruments (composed 1976), and in 1980 for Firewind for two pianos (composed 1978) and Diffusa est gratia for a cappella choir (composed 1979). In 1995 he won the Jules L√©ger Prize for New Chamber Music for his String Quartet. Many of his compositions have been recorded, including Firewind by pianists Bruce Mather and Pierrette LePage, ...ascends at full moon by guitarist Michael Laucke, and √Ä la source d'Hypocr√®ne by the ensemble of the Soci√©t√© de musique contemporaine du Qu√©bec among others. Burke was born in Toronto, and earned a Bachelor of Music in 1974 from McGill University, where he was a pupil of Bruce Mather and Alcides Lanza. Immediately following he entered the graduate music composition program at the University of Michigan (UM) where he obtained a Master of Music in 1976 and later a Doctor of Music in 1983. Among his teachers at the UM were William Albright, Leslie Bassett, William Bolcom, and George Balch Wilson. A grant from the Canada Council enabled him to pursue studies in France in 1978‚Äì1979 with Eugene Kurtz. In 1980 he worked at McGill University as a visiting professor in electronic music and music theory, returning to the UM in 1981 to pursue his doctoral degree. From 1983‚Äì1985 he was a member of the music faculty at McMaster University and in 1990 he joined the faculty at the University of Victoria. He died in Marmora, Ontario.

History CGD was founded in 1948 by singer Teddy Reno. At that time it was established in Milan in Via Passarella 4. As artistic director Reno called fellow musician Lelio Luttazzi, who replaced David Matalon as Head of International Production in 1956. By collaborating with some publishers such as Suvini-Zerboni and Messaggerie Musical, CGD was able to hire many artists who roused much success as Giorgio Consolini, Betty Curtis and Johnny Dorelli. Under the Sugar Helm In 1959, Teddy Reno sold CGD to Ladislao Sugar, a publisher of Hungarian origin and future entrepreneurial owner of the Sugar Group, which was founded by Carlo Alberto Rossi's Casa Editrice Ariston, and then abandoned to buy Musical Messengers (Messaggerie Musicali). It was on this occasion that he came into contact with Teddy Reno. In 1961, CGD moved to Galleria del Corso, where many other record labels and music publishing were located. In 1968, Ladislas decided to focus on the publishing division Grove Press and was replaced by his son, Peter. Merger with CBS Italia In 1966, CGD made an agreement with CBS to distribute its catalog in Italy. In 1970, CGD eventually merged with CBS Italia and established CBS Sugar. In 1973, it moved to Via Quintiliano 40. In 1977, when CBS decided to open its own premises in Italy, all the Italian artists who recorded for CBS were incorporated with CGD and their records were reissued by the new record label. In the same year, Peter Sugar's wife, pop star Caterina Caselli decided to establish a satellite record company, supporting non-mainstream acts like The Radio Dept, Franco Fanigliulo, Piccola Orchestra Avion Travel and Elisa. Later years Throughout the 1980s, CGD continued its operations with 9 subsidiary labels. A notable signee during this decade was the late American singer Nicolette Larson, who recorded only one album for the company, Shadows of Love. In 1988, CGD, like many other record companies, ran out of business. East West Records, under Warner Music Group, bought the label & continued its operations. In 1995, it changed its name to CGD East West. In early 2000s, the former was merged to Atlantic Records.

He also participated in several European academic networks of excellence, CLIOHNET, CLIOHNET 2 (2002‚Äì2005), CLIOHRES (2005‚Äì2010) and is currently in charge of the team represented in CLIOH-WORLD since 2008 on behalf of the University of Toulouse II - Le Mirail. He is co- founder and chief-editor of the Revue d'Histoire Nordique since 2005, a bilingual French-English historical review dedicated to the history and civilisation of both Scandinavia and the Baltic countries, and director of the Centre of Excellence Jean Monnet of the University of Toulouse II-Le Mirail. He has mainly written on Spanish Modern history, for instance Spanish foreign policy during the Second Republic and the Spanish Civil War (1931‚Äì1939) with regard to the great powers and the Spanish Republican exile in France after 1936‚Äì1939, but he also published articles about Scandinavian modern history. He is now involved in a broad research project dedicated to the peripheries of Europe (i.e. Northern Europe, East-Central and South-Eastern Europe and Mediterranean Europe) from the 18th to the 20th century.

History The Rapsons Group was Scotland‚Äôs largest independent operator as well as a group of companies serving the Highlands & Islands based from its HQ at Seafield Road, Inverness trading as Rapsons Coaches, Highland Country Buses, Orkney & Causeway Coaches and also operated on long-distance Scottish Citylink/National Express contracts operating over 250 vehicles with approx. 400 employees along with depots in Inverness, Aviemore, Fort William, Portree, Wick, Thurso & Kirkwall. While regular bus services traded as Highland Country, longer distance, express and private contract work operate under the Rapson's name. Rapsons were founded in 1945 but came further into business between the 1970s to 1980s. In August 1991, Highland Scottish was sold to a consortium made up of Rapsons Coaches that recently privatised Scottish Citylink, for ¬£800k. In March 1993, ownership of Highland Scottish passed wholly to Rapsons and a more modern deep red and cream livery, with a dark red wedge and yellow coachlines, was introduced for the fleet The golden eagle emblem, once used by Highland Omnibuses, was reintroduced in a larger size toward the rear of the vehicle and the company traded simply as Highland. Highland Country buses adopted a starkly different livery to the traditional red by going for a two-tone blue livery, with a large St Andrew's Cross in the centre of its 'Highland Country' logo. However, in October 1995, the company was split in two, with Rapsons retaining the eastern services under Highland Bus & Coach Ltd, with the remainder passed to a new company, Highland Country Buses Ltd. Highland Scottish Omnibuses at that time ceased to exist as a whole concern and in October 1995, the company was split in two and Highland Country Buses was bought by National Express for ¬£1.8m. The two companies continued to exist under separate ownership until August 1998 when Rapsons bought Highland Country Buses back from National Express for ¬£4m ‚Äì ¬£2.2m. After a brief interval, the assets and services of Inverness Traction were purchased by the Stagecoach Group. Highland, perhaps aware it could not sustain competition against a national operator with a reputation for swift and successful competition, scaled down the level of service against the new operator. Soon after, Stagecoach would purchase the Inverness and Tain operations of Highland Scottish and become the dominant operator of Inverness area services. In 1999, Rapsons began to expand into Orkney of the Orkney Islands bus market with the acquisition of four separate bus companies on the islands, including the largest, James D. Peace & Shalder Coaches. As well as having operations on Orkney, Shalder Coaches was originally a Shetland operator as well meaning that Rapsons also expanded into Shetland beginning an operation trading as Shetland Coaches & Shalder Coaches with a depot based at Lower Scord, Scalloway. However, Rapsons pulled out of Shetland in 2003 after they lost all contracts when going for an increase in rates with most vehicles previously run by Shalder or purchased for Shetland passing onto Rapsons other depots after Rapsons shut down their Shetland operation. In June 2005, Orkney Coaches who is the Orcadian operation became part of Rapsons when the takeover was complete since expanding since 1999 and remained a separate subsidiary to Highland Country Buses. In March 2006, Rapsons gave up most of their long- distance coach contracts with Scottish Citylink and National Express and later in the same year, Rapsons bus drivers threatened to strike before voting by a majority to accept an improved pay offer from their employers. About 200 workers with Rapsons came close to taking industrial action. In May 2007, there was a sub-investment in low-floor vehicles for a quality partnership between Rapsons and the Inverness council to upgrade bus services after winning HiTrans contracts. Around ¬£500,000 was spent to cut the amount of harmful exhaust gasses emitted by its vehicles. Rapsons received a further ¬£160,000 from the Highlands and Islands Strategic Transport Partnership (HiTrans) towards the ¬£650,0000 cost of buying five new low-emission buses which owed to a fuel addidative. The Euro 4 buses feature floors low enough to allow wheelchair users to access the vehicles, making them fully compliant with the disability discrimination legislation as well as being 41 seaters to be the first to provide a seatbelt for every passenger. 5 of these were Wright Eclipse Urban bodied Volvo B7RLE and 3 were added to the firm‚Äôs fleet in Inverness with the other 2 on Orkney and the fleet that were replaced by them were transferred to Rapsons Lochaber & Skye depots. In May 2008, Stagecoach were in talks with the possible sale of Rapsons and it was rumored for a while until on May 16, 2008, it was finally announced that the long anticipated purchase of Highland Country Buses (and Orkney Coaches Ltd) by Stagecoach Group had been finalised and that Stagecoach had consolidated its position in the north of Scotland and swelled Stagecoach's north of Scotland fleet to 370 vehicles, covering Britain from Cornwall to Orkney with the Seafield Road depot closing. The takeover was finally complete in 2009 and all operations are now part of the Stagecoach Group. There is now a very small handful of ex Rapson vehicles still left in livery in use although a number of these are now withdrawn & preserved vehicles meaning that some of the Rapson colours and logo are still on some of the fleet including these but the remaining ones have the Stagecoach logo at the front and the 'Rapson' logo on the side and both the Rapsons and Stagecoach logo on the rear known as Stagecoach Highlands's Pre-Livery. In April 2011 the operations at Inverness & Easter Ross were transferred to the Highland Country operating licence from the Bluebird Buses licence. In late 2011, the depot at Burnett Road closed and now operate from the former Rapsons Inverness depot at Seafield Road, Inverness which has now re-opened for Stagecoach Inverness.

He belonged to the Phagmodrupa Dynasty, which was the leading regime of central Tibet from 1354 to 1435 and maintained a certain political role until the early 17th century. Appointment Ngagi Wangpo was the only son of King Drakpa Jungne and a lady of the Kharpa family. Still a minor at his father's death in 1445, he was made abbot of Thel in 1454. Four years later his uncle, King Kunga Lekpa, himself acquired the abbot-ship of Thel, and Ngagi Wangpo had to stay in a succession of other places. The late 15th century was filled with internal disputes in Central Tibet, and the direct authority of the Phagmodru ruler was at best restricted to √ú (East Central Tibet). In Tsang (West Central Tibet) the Rinpungpa feudatories dominated. In 1481 Kunga Lekpa was deprived of the kingship by a council of ministers, after a series of invasions by Donyo Dorje of Rinpungpa. Instead his nephew Ngagi Wangpo was invited to take the position as king (gongma, \\"the high one\\"). At his enthronement he married Lady Dsongkhama. In 1488 she bore him a son called Ngawang Tashi Drakpa.Giuseppe Tucci, Den T'er Dmar Po Gsar Ma. Rome 1971, p. 225-6. Continuing internal troubles During his decade-long reign Ngagi Wangpo was honoured by the elites of Central Tibet as their overlord (chipon). Nevertheless, his time was marked by unsafe conditions and rivalry between various parts of the country. In 1485 the Rinpungpa lord Donyo Dorje led an attack on Gyangtse, which was under a Phagmodrupa minister. Three years later the Rinpungpa finally got the upper hand and appropriated Gyangtse.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa, Tibet. A Political History. Yale 1967, p. 88. When Ngagi Wangpo died on 8 July 1491 the dominance of the Rinpungpa seemed complete. Donyo Dorje's uncle Tsokye Dorje (d. 1510) took over as regent since the heir to the throne was merely a small boy. The Ming Dynasty of China by this time had only the faintest knowledge of internal Tibetan politics, since they noted the accession and subsequent death of Ngagi Wangpo in 1495; they knew the king by the name Ban Aji Jiangdong Daba.Giuseppe Tucci, Tibetan Painted Scrolls.

Cytometry is the measurement of the characteristics of cells. Variables that can be measured by cytometric methods include cell size, cell count, cell morphology (shape and structure), cell cycle phase, DNA content, and the existence or absence of specific proteins on the cell surface or in the cytoplasm. Cytometry is used to characterize and count blood cells in common blood tests such as the complete blood count. In a similar fashion, cytometry is also used in cell biology research and in medical diagnostics to characterize cells in a wide range of applications associated with diseases such as cancer and AIDS. Cytometric devices =Image cytometers= Image cytometry is the oldest form of cytometry. Image cytometers operate by statically imaging a large number of cells using optical microscopy. Prior to analysis, cells are commonly stained to enhance contrast or to detect specific molecules by labeling these with fluorochromes. Traditionally, cells are viewed within a hemocytometer to aid manual counting. Since the introduction of the digital camera, in the mid-1990s, the automation level of image cytometers has steadily increased. This has led to the commercial availability of automated image cytometers, ranging from simple cell counters to sophisticated high-content screening systems. =Flow cytometers= Due to the early difficulties of automating microscopy, the flow cytometer has since the mid-1950s been the dominating cytometric device. Flow cytometers operate by aligning single cells using flow techniques. The cells are characterized optically or by the use of an electrical impedance method called the Coulter principle. To detect specific molecules when optically characterized, cells are in most cases stained with the same type of fluorochromes that are used by image cytometers. Flow cytometers generally provide less data than image cytometers, but have a significantly higher throughput. =Cell sorters= Cell sorters are flow cytometers capable of sorting cells according to their characteristics. The sorting is achieved by using technology similar to what is used in inkjet printers. The fluid stream is broken up into droplets by a mechanical vibration. The droplets are then electrically charged according to the characteristics of the cell contained within the droplet. Depending on their charge, the droplets are finally deflected by an electric field into different containers. =Time-lapse cytometers= A key characteristic of time-lapse cytometers is their use of non heat-generating light sources such as light-emitting diodes. This allows a time-lapse cytometer to be placed inside a conventional cell culture incubator to facilitate continuous observation of cellular processes without heat building up inside the incubator. History A hemocytometer =Hemocytometer= The early history of cytometry is closely associated with the development of the blood cell counting. Through the work of Karl von Vierordt, Louis-Charles Malassez, Karl B√ºrker and others blood cell concentration could by the late 19th century be accurately measured using a blood cell counting chamber, the hemocytometer, and an optical microscope. Until the 1950s the hemocytometer was the standard method to count blood cells. In blood cell counting applications the hemocytometer has now been replaced by electronic cell counters. However, the hemocytometer is still being used to count cells in cell culture laboratories. Successively the manual task of counting, using a microscope, is taken over by small automated image cytometers. =Fluorescence microscope= In 1904, Moritz von Rohr and August K√∂hler at Carl Zeiss in Jena constructed the first ultraviolet microscope. The intent of the microscope was to obtain higher optical resolution by using illumination with a shorter wavelength than visual light. However, they experienced difficulties with autofluorescence when observing biological material. Fortunately, K√∂hler saw the potential of fluorescence. A filtering technique for fluorescence excitation light was developed by Heinrich Lehmann at Zeiss in 1910, based on work by Robert Wood. However, the \\"Lumineszenzmikroskop\\" he developed was only second on the market, after the one independently developed by Oskar Heimst√§dt who worked at C Reichert, Optische Werke AG in Vienna, which today is a part of Leica Microsystems. =Cytophotometry= By the early 1930s various firms manufactured ultraviolet fluorescent microscopes. The stage was set for cytometry to now go beyond the now established hemocytometer. At this time, Torbj√∂rn Caspersson, working at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, developed a series of progressively more sophisticated instruments called cytophotometers. These instruments combined a fluorescent microscope with a spectrophotometer to quantify cellular nucleic acids and their relation to cell growth and function. Caspersson‚Äôs early apparatus now seems hopelessly primitive. But, even this primitive apparatus got results, and attracted the attention of other researchers. Many of the advances in analytical cytology from the 1940s and on-wards were made by people who made the pilgrimage to Stockholm. =Pulse cytophotometry= Coulter Counter -- The first commercial flow cytometer The first attempts to automate cell counting were made around World War II. Gucker et al. builds a device to detect bacteria in aerosols. Lagercrantz builds an automated cell counter based on microscopy and identifies the difficulties in aligning cells to be individually counted using microscopy, as Moldavan had proposed in 1934. Joseph and Wallace Coulter circumnavigates these difficulties by inventing the principle of using electrical impedance to count and size microscopic particles suspended in a fluid. This principle is today known as the Coulter principle and was used in the automated blood cell counter released by Coulter Electronics in 1954. The ‚ÄúCoulter counter‚Äù was the first commercial flow cytometer. During the 1960s Dittrich, G√∂hde and Kamentsky improves the design pioneered by Caspersson 30 years earlier. Dittrich and G√∂hde‚Äôs pulse cytophotometer was built around a Zeiss fluorescent microscope and commercialized as the ICP 11 by Partec GmbH in 1968. Kamentsky‚Äôs device was commercialized by Bio/Physics Systems Inc. as the Cytograph in 1970. These devices were able to count cells, like the earlier Coulter counter. But more importantly, they were also capable of measuring cellular characteristics. However, these early cytophotometers where microscopy-based. = Flow cytometry = In 1953 Crosland-Taylor published an unsuccessful attempt to count red blood cells using microscopy in which he solved the problem of aligning cells by using sheath fluid to hydrodynamically focus the cells. In the late 1960s, Van Dilla at Los Alamos National Laboratory built the first non microscopy-based cytophotometer. He did this by combining Crosland-Taylor's breakthrough with the fluorescent dyes originally developed for microscopy and a laser-based fluorescent detection system -- the flow cytometer as we know it today. Fulwyler, at Los Alamos as well, combines the Coulter principle with continuous inkjet printer technology to create the first cell sorter in 1965. In 1973 Steinkamp and the team at Los Alamos follow up with a fluorescence-based cell sorter. In 1978, at the Conference of the American Engineering Foundation in Pensacola, Florida, the name pulse cytophotometry was changed to flow cytometry, a term which quickly became popular. At that point pulse cytophotometry had evolved into the modern form of flow cytometry, pioneered by Van Dilla ten years earlier.

Moon (born July 15, 1938) is an Apple Computers executive. He has engineering degrees from Pennsylvania State University and New York University. From the 1960s to the 1980s, Moon worked for companies including IBM, National Micronetics Corporation, Tandon Magnetics Corporation, and Apple. Early life Moon was born in Philadelphia, on July 15, 1938. His father, Perry Moon was a construction worker who often answered John's questions about how things work. John spent his time building model cars in the family basement where he assembled and took apart electronic devices. Since he worked so well with his hands, he was quick at repairing things like radios, earning him the nickname \\"fix-it boy\\", which was given to him by his neighbors.Sullivan, Richard Otha (1998), African American Inventors (Black Stars) Education Moon's best subjects in school were Mathematics, Science and English. After he graduated high school with honors, he enrolled at Pennsylvania State University where he received a degree in mechanical engineering in 1960. After graduating from there he decided to further pursue his education and get his masters from New York University (NYU) where he continued his studies in engineering. Careers =IBM= During the 1960s major companies started recruiting African Americans to work with and for them due to the change of the race relations and they were responding to the demands that the Civil Rights Movement put on government and businesses suggesting that there should be equal opportunities for all. Moon was hired at IBM (International Business Machines) in New York City through a program that was hiring African Americans who have experience in the math and science fields; particularly engineers. Though Moon knew very little about computers when he began his career at IBM he thrived throughout the remainder of his time there. He was hired when computer technology was changing rapidly. He joined other IBM scientists in physics, electrical and mechanical engineering and chemistry who were looking at ways to better computers and how they function. He left IBM in 1970. =National Micronetics Corporation= In 1970, Moon established the National Micronetics Corporation with a few other engineers in a garage. There, they researched ways to use a magnetic substance called ferrite. From there, he and his colleagues found a way to make ferrite recording heads which were in high demand. Within a couple years their business grew from five people working in a garage to a multimillion-dollar company. Four years later, he moved to California where he worked for several different technology companies. =Tandon Magnetics Corporation= In 1976, he started working with Tandon Magnetics Corporation. The double side disc that could save more data was invented by Jugi Tandon, and Moon contributed to the success of this product by finding a new way to manufacture this new technological advance by making these ferrite recording heads through mass production rather than one at a time. The implication of Moon's mass production brought a lot of money to the company. =Apple= Moon moved to Apple Computers (Apple Inc.) in 1980. Around this time, Apple Computers were the leading personal computer company. Though they had already been making over $100 million. To further their success Apple hired Moon to help the company design and make its own floppy disks and disk drives of which several were designed himself.

On December 31, 2008, the operators of the dinner train announced that they would be shutting down the route due to poor ridership and increased costs in fuel and other various expenses.  History  Jack Haley, founder of the original Star Clipper in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was flying back to Iowa after meeting with representative in the Providence, RI, area, to set up his second dinner train operation. While en route, his aircraft experienced mechanical difficulties, and they made an unscheduled landing at the Kalamazoo, MI, airport. They were told repairs would take some time, so Jack and his entourage decided to drive a few miles west to Paw Paw, Michigan, to check out the Kalamazoo, Lake Shore, & Chicago Railway tourist train operation. The impromptu meeting with Mark Campbell, Kevin McKinney, and Jerry Pilcher of the KLS&C; resulted in a deal to bring a Star Clipper Dinner Train to western Michigan, to operate on the ex-C&O; branch line, now operated by the KLS&C.; A new siding was built in Paw Paw to accommodate the dinner train, and the Star Clipper staff soon begin advertising and taking reservations. The Star Clipper was a tenant on the tracks of the KLS&C;, and each time it departed, it paid the KLS&C; a \\"pull fee\\" to haul the dinner train out and back. The Star Clipper was wildly popular from the beginning, attracting diners from both the Chicago and Detroit metro markets. However, Jack Haley's corporation was saddled with a huge amount of debt and overhead, and into the second year of operation, they began to fall behind in their payments to the KLS&C; Railway. Sensing something was up, and not for the good of the Railway, the owners tried to purchase the Star Clipper away from the Haley group, but were unable to persuade a majority investor to go along with them. The next day the Michigan Star Clipper declared bankruptcy, and were now protected from making payments by the bankruptcy court. In fact, the Star Clipper was able to \\"claw back\\" tens of thousands of dollars that it had paid to the KLS&C;, as they were payments for services rendered in the past, not contemporary or current. In the end, the Michigan Star Clipper, thru the auspices of the bankruptcy court, were able to make a deal with another short line in Michigan, called Coe Rail, owned at the time by Larry Coe. As soon as knowledge of this transaction took place, the owners of the KLS&C; began making plans to find replacement equipment to operate another dinner train over their railroad, as the concept had proven itself. The Michigan Star Clipper dinner train operated for several years out of Walled Lake on approximately of the Michigan Air-Line Railway rail line. It was the brain child of one of the legendary short line and regional railroad operators in the United States, Mr. Jack Haley. The Star Clipper first operated out of Osage, Iowa, in 1984. In 1985 Mr. Haley first teamed up with the KLS&C; Railway in Paw Paw, Michigan. Mark Campbell, Kevin McKinney, and Jerry Pilcher, owners, who brought the train to Michigan, first to Paw Paw in 1985 and then to Walled Lake in 1986, where it has been ever since. The Iowa operations were discontinued in December 1987 with Mr. Haley‚Äôs decision to sell the railroad to an up-and-coming freight railroad conglomerate. The Star Clipper made a brief appearance in the Fort Worth, Texas, area, running two seasons, 1999 and 2000. In 2006 the Star Clipper Dinner Train was sold to Railmark Holdings who increased and expanded both its programming and advertising in order to meet an ever changing and diverse ridership demographic in a world of internet communications. The trip started and finished from the historic Walled Lake CoeRail depot, in operation since 1887 on Pontiac Trail Rd. in Walled Lake, MI. The trip was on the Michigan Air-Line Railway which dead-ended into the main line owned by CSX. The locomotive for the Michigan Star Clipper is a General Motors EMD F7 1,500-horsepower engine, built in 1950 for the Erie Lackawanna Railroad. The engine, rebuilt and computerized, is electric and operated the train so smoothly, at a top speed of 10 m.p.h., that even the drinks on the dining tables did not spill out.  Entertainment  The Michigan Star Clipper dinner train offered three-hour, five course premium dinner trains, two-hour, three- course dinner trains, Sunday family dinner trains, luncheon trains, and children's lunch & breakfast trains. For certain events, passengers even had the option to stay overnight onboard one of the Pullman sleeping compartment cars. The various forms of entertainment while on an excursion included a murder mystery theatre, holiday themed theatre shows (Christmas, Easter, and a New Year's Eve show), musical reviews featuring various live performers, fall color tours, and various other special event venues. Meals Unlike many of the other 22 dinner trains across the country that used catered meals, the Michigan Star Clipper featured live on-board chefs who prepared four and five course meals. An example of what the five course meals included were the Star Clipper's signature prime rib entr√©e with a grilled shrimp skewer, chicken cordon bleu, or sauteed red snapper as the main entr√©e. The meals started off with a house salad and all of the dinners came with bread and the chef's specialty honey butter, fresh brewed coffee, hot tea, and water. The meal also came with a bowl of classic soup or a featured sorbet. The dinner was rounded off with a choice of freshly prepared desserts.  Cancellation  Due to increasingly poor ticket sales, the Star Clipper's owner, railroad industry veteran B. Allen Brown, decided to cease railway operations. The last excursion was made on December 31, 2008. The owner has suggested that his new international company, Rail Entertainment U.S.A., will be a new and exciting endeavor offering entertainment trains across America and into Canada. There has been some speculation and rumors in various Railfan Blogspot sites that the Michigan Star Clipper dinner train will be moved to an undisclosed location somewhere on the East Coast most likely in the New England area. On November 12, 2009, Railmark Holdings, Inc. announced that it sold its Michigan Air-Line Railway Co. to Nebraska-based Browner Turnout Co. Browner Turnout Co. becomes the fifth owner of the rail line in 123 years and there are various plans in discussion as to the future of the rail line. The rail spur upon which the train used to run has been completely abandoned with all rails and ties removed and the bed graded June 2012. All rail crossings have been permanently marked \\"out of service\\" and the crossing arms where the rail crossed the M-5 road have been removed in June 2013 and on July 18, 2014, the remaining rail that crossed M-5 has been removed and filled with concrete. The rail spur between Haggerty Rd and Telegraph Rd is now made for (Rail-Trail) walking / bike access.

The books are published by St. Martin's Press. It consists of eleven books that take place in a future time in a place known as the Ichidian Universe. In this universe, The League is in charge. The brutal, expertly trained League Assassins are essentially the power of the government. But like all governments, even the League is corrupt. The tagline for the series is In Morte Veritas (In Death, There is Truth). Born of Night =Characters= Nykyrian Quiakides, also known as Nemesis, is a half Andarion, half human former League assassin. He was born and trained to be a cold-blooded killer. He left the League because he didn't want to be a pawn for the corrupt government. Creating the alternate persona of Nemesis, Nykyrian along with his comrades help to counter the League's twisted view of the law. He is considered invincible, as many have tried to kill him yet none have succeeded. Kiara Zamir is a famous dancer. Since her father is the president of her planet, she has never wanted for anything except peace. She is a constant target for assassins trying to use her to get to her father. =Summary= Rogue League assassin Nykyrian Quikiades is charged with the protection of Kiara Zamir, whose father's political power makes her a target for the Ichidian Universe's most deadly assassins. Along this journey, Kiara shows Nykyrian that he is not the monster he thinks of himself as. She shows him love the way no other has. For Nykyrian, what started as a job turns into an obsessive need to keep Kiara safe. Along the way, he must face his most powerful adversaries as well as the entire League force hunting him and his charge down.http://web.ebscohost.com/novelist/detail?vid=3&hid;=3&sid;=fc1c5b8c-bf44-4ec1-b46f-b08e3f16df7e%40sessionmgr14&bdata;=JnNpdGU9bm92ZWxpc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d Born of Fire =Characters= Sheridan Digger Wade, more commonly referenced as Syn throughout the series, began his life as a \\"tech-thief\\". His father was one of the universe's most formidable thieves. He followed in his father's footsteps and became C.I. Syn, the most feared and well known thief in history. He is Nykyrian Quikiades' only friend and he does not use that term lightly. Nykyrian found Syn when he was a young man and offered to help bury his past so Syn could start a new life. He married and had a family, only to have it all ripped away from him once his past came back to haunt him. Since then he became a doctor in order to help Nykyrian and his cause to fight the League. He is also a deadly assassin as well as an alcoholic. He could be considered a form of comic relief throughout the series. Shahara Dagan is said to be the best bounty hunter in the universe. Her brother Caillen is a known smuggler and one of Syn's close friends. She is fearless and fiercely protective of her family. =Summary= Syn has been trained by Nykyrian to be one of the deadliest assassins. But his shady past comes back to haunt him and now he's being hunted by the law. Shahara Dagan is the best bounty hunter in the Ichidian Universe. She has been charged with finding Syn and bringing him to justice. Now, Syn must prove that the charges against him are false and convince Shahara to help him prove his innocence. Shahara must decide between her brother's friend and her job to bring him in. The book details Syn's past, where his father Idirian Wade abused him and his sister to the point where Syn's sister cut her wrists and committed suicide when Syn was slow returning home. Afterwards Syn turned his father in only to be imprisoned under suspicion of his father's insanity being passed to him through genetics. He spent his life escaping from prisons, breaking various laws and trusting no one. But then Shahara breaks into his apartment and tries to capture him only to be taken captive herself. During her captivity she and Syn have brief moments of attraction until Syn releases her in return for her calling off her bounty on him and swearing to never bother him again‚Äîshe is required to honor her work as a Seax. She calls the law enforcement and Syn is arrested and tortured until she discovers Syn has helped her brother and sisters, who have fallen on hard times like her and she rescues him. Angered at first, Syn works with Shahara for the mutual goal of escaping the corrupt tracers sent to silence Syn and gather a chip he had hid from them as a child. Over the course of the book their affections grow to the point where they have sex and begin to trust each other more. Shahara is required to pretend to betray Syn-who is out of the loop on the plan to keep the chip safe from Merjack, who has been leading the blood hunt on Syn to find the chip, which possesses evidence of the Merjack family's corruption. Though released after a trial, where his mother is the judge‚ÄîSyn had refused to turn evidence of his innocence in since he refused to meet his mother, who had become hysteric when he approached her as a child and tossed him to the streets Syn refused to speak or associate with Shahara, who becomes depressed to the point where she refuses to use her large reward for revealing Merjack's corruption. But several months later, Syn is talked out of his booze-filled gloom by Nykyrian and sends Shahara a dress she had wanted to buy during their adventure as a gift before appearing in her apartment himself where he proposes. The epilogue takes place two years later where Shahara reveals she is pregnant‚Äîshe and Syn had believed that a sexual assault that led her to becoming a Seax and a Tracer as a teenager left her unable to bear children. Born of Ice =Characters= Devyn Kell is a former League ally. But like Nykyrian, once he learned of their corruption and ruthlessness, he defected and became a runner. His job now is to make sure that planets in the Ichidian Universe get the supplies and weapons they need to survive. Alix Garran is a woman with a mysterious past and more secrets than anyone in the universe. She's incredibly loyal and brilliant with anything mechanical, which got her the job as a systems engineer for Devyn Wade. Later she is revealed to be a slave who was chosen by the nemesis of the Wade family, Merjack due to her similarity to Devyn's deceased lover who had betrayed him. With her sister and mother on the line she must choose between her family and the man she loves. =Summary= Devyn Kell has left the League. But it's not likely that the League will let him go without a fight. Now working as a runner, he has acquired the help of the mysterious Alix Garran as his systems engineer. With her affinity for all things mechanical and her lack of ties to any friends or family, she's a perfect choice for the rogue's crew. But as both of their pasts catch up to them, the must now fight for their freedom and for each other.http://www.yearofacheron.com/league_series/born_of_ice.html The book begins with Devyn serving as a field doctor during a campaign against rebels.

When he tries to help, his commanding officer commands him to abandon Omari and help their own soldiers (who are lightly wounded). When Devyn refuses and is threatened at gun point he disarms his commander and kills or cripples every soldier in his unit. Then he supposedly goes to Nykyrian, who uses his influence to call off the bounty on Devyn's head. Years later, Alix has been recruited by Merjack under the threat of her sister being sold as a sex slave to find evidence of crimes by Devyn.

Devyn saves her, and later they have sex when Alix tries to do what she thinks is payment for him saving her. Devyn is shocked at her lack of knowledge of sex and how she thinks that she is required to sleep with him, but begins to show Alix how to embrace her freedom. Over the course of the novel Alix is revealed by Devyn's father, Syn, and is forced to confess to Devyn. Despite thoughts of killing her‚Äîalong with demands from his mother Shahara to do so he spares her and agrees to help her bring Merjack down.

Devyn saves her once again and they go on the run, removing her tracking chip before crashing on a planet. While fleeing, Devyn and Alix are saved by a bitter Paden, who had intended to use Alix's forged evidence against Merjack to prove his corruption.

However the group manages to meet up with Syn, Shahara, Caillen (Shahara's smuggler brother), League Assassins Darion and Jace, Darling Cruel and Nykyrian to rescue Devyn. They manage to have Merjack arrested in the middle of the torture session, but Merjack breaks free and tries to kill Syn. Paden, in a moment of repentance, takes the shot for his father and apologizes for how he allowed his mother to turn him against his father‚Äîeven offering to give his organs to help a recovering Devyn. In the end Devyn recovers, and Alix is reunited with her family after they are freed by several of Syn's friends. A year later Alix is revealed to be pregnant with Devyn's child.

It was designed by the architectural firm, The Eggers Partnership also known as Eggers & Higgins. Development The planning for the development began in 1971, but construction did not begin until the late '70s. By purchasing the air rights above the Metro-North Railroad tracks (then Penn Central), the new housing project was able to be built without tearing down any buildings or displacing any residents both of which saved on costs and may be one of the reasons why NYCHA was able to build such a large project during a period when few public housing units were built, even in New York City.City Is Planning Housing Over Bronx Rail Tracks, By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, May 26, 1971, New York Times. The Morrisania Air Rights utilized a method of construction developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that relies on steel trusses rather than closely spaced steel columns, allowing the railroad to remain in operation during construction. Constructed well after the boom of public housing through the 1940s, 50s and 60s, NYCHA stopped naming the buildings inspirationally knowing there would be many tenant applications and the development is named after the air rights. The project was completed on January 1, 1981.

The bands compete in their own local, state and regional competitions to participate in this event, though there are no prerequisites for participating in Grand Nationals. Participation is based on a first-come, first-served basis. The awards include a ceremony for the top twelve bands and separate awards for the bands who specialized in visual effect, musical effect and overall general effect. History The event began in 1976 held during the Summer National Championship as a part of a workshop/festival in Whitewater, WI. Four years later it grew in size and took place in the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, FL. The event was won by J.M. Tate High School. In 1984 the event was moved to the RCA Dome (originally named the Hoosier Dome) in Indianapolis, IN, where it remained for many years afterward, aside from taking place in the Pontiac Silver Dome in 1987 and 1988. In 2008, the competition moved to the Lucas Oil Stadium. The Event The competition typically takes place at the beginning of November. The first round of performances, Preliminaries, lasts up to two days and is narrowed down to an average of thirty six bands that move on to Semi-Finals (though this number is variable, and is contingent on the number of class representatives). By the last day, participating bands from across the country are further narrowed down to the twelve highest scoring groups. The top scoring bands will each draw a random performance time slot, with the top 6 of semifinals performing in the latter half of finals, and the lower 6 performing earlier. After finals has concluded, the bands, still in their uniforms, march onto the field to stand before the audience. Over the loud speaker after much dramatic celebration, the announcer gives the results, beginning with twelfth place and finishing with the winner of that year's Bands of America Grand National Championships. After announcing the winner, the announcer speaks the words, \\"Remember, you are all winners in life,\\" the bands may break ranks to congratulate each other. Finally, the field is cleared for the Champion Band's encore performance. Audience Available for purchase at the Grand National Championships is a booklet that highlights each band and offers a picture, statement of the show and a small factual paragraph. The book, however, also holds two or three pages worth of score sheets for one to copy down as they are announced throughout the competition. Surrounding the field, and the stand, are several band related vendors, selling anything from music, to pins, to equipment, to souvenirs, all band related, for the competitors parents and loved ones to bestow upon them after the weekend. Along with the vendors that line the halls of the stadium come drum corps and national bands performing outside the high school level to recruit the young performers.

Since 2000, Faithfull abandoned paper He now makes his drawings using a bespoke iPhone app, Limbo. Faithfull‚Äôs practice often involves elements of failure and anti- heroism. His works revolve around research and experiments, and during the course of the past few years he has become known for his Lecture Performances that will often accompany his exhibitions. He is cited as trying to measure the world in order to check whether it exists and whether, when absent, he also still exists. Journeys and traveling are central to his practice, whether it involves the end of the world, outer space, or a simple bike ride, they offer crucial material for Faithfull. Influences include Smithson and Richard Long. In 2006, Faithfull released LOST (as part of a Whitstable Biennale 2006 commission), a book that catalogues the objects lost by the artist during the course of his lifetime, alongside the stories that accompany these losses. 500 of the books were left around Whitstable as part of an ongoing web project, as their finders are encouraged to record their discoveries before re-releasing them back into the world. In a series of experiments conducted over ten years (1995‚Äì2005), Faithfull sought to defy gravity with his 'Escape vehicles'. Seven in total to date, these Escape Vehicles range from the use of balloons, chairs, insects, and rockets. Escape Vehicle no.6 saw a domestic chair travel from the earth to the edge of space. An audience first witnessed the chair, tethered beneath a weather balloon, disappear into the sky and then watched a live video transmission from the vehicle showing the chair reaching an altitude of 30 km high. Seen against the blackness of space and the curvature of the earth the chair finally broke up at the edge of space. Since 2003, Faithfull has lectured at the Slade School of Fine Art.http://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=SFAIT47 and is currently Reader in Fine Art. Simon Faithfull is represented by Galerie Polaris, Paris.  Notable artworks  =REEF, 2014= REEF (2014). Sinking the Brioney Victoria. Image courtesy of Weber Industries. Reef saw Faithfull intentionally sink a boat called the Brioney Victoria off the coast of Southwest England. The boat was scuttled as a live event on 4 August 2014 with five cameras mounted onboard transmitting a live video stream of the boat making its final journey to the bottom of the sea. The video-work created from this event uses footage from these 5 cameras and documentation from a number of other vantage points, to tell the story of a process of transformation. The film presents the very beginning of a slow metamorphosis from defunct vessel at the end of its life, to the creation of an artificial reef ‚Äì a process that will take further hundreds or even thousands of years to complete. =EZY1899: Reenactment for a Future Scenario= This film depicts the Sisyphean efforts of a silver-suited commuter to board and fly in a monstrous rendition of a 1990s jet. The unreal vehicle is misshapen, blackened by fire and missing a wing, the craft will not fly, but the traveller undertakes his ritual of boarding and waiting for take off whilst flames surround him. The work was commissioned by Tatton Park Biennial 2012, Flights of Fancy and was subsequently included in Risk at Turner Contemporary. =Limbo Drawings/ An Expanding Atlas of Subjectivity, ongoing= Whenever Faithfull makes a new drawing it is immediately dispatched out to the world via the Limbo drawing service and automatically added to an ever-growing, online database which contains every drawing made by Faithfull since 2000. An Expanding Atlas of Subjectivity is a unique artwork in the form of a bespoke hand-sewn bookwork, a paper archive that captures one particular moment from this database. Each time a new book is ordered the latest drawings are added so each book is thicker than the last and no two books will ever be the same. The bookwork makes physical the body of drawings that has accreted over more than a decade ‚Äì manifesting a personal atlas of the world, mapping time and space, as experienced by one individual, on an ongoing basis. Faithfull periodically exhibits An Expanding Atlas of Subjectivity as a gallery installation during which the most recent drawings are added as and when they are made. Exhibitions to date have taken place in Lille, National Museum, Project Space, Berlin, and at Phoenix Arts in Leicester. =Mobile Research Station no.1, 2009= Mobile Research Station was a project commissioned by SKULPTURENPARK BERLIN_ZENTRUM in 2009, that took place in the centre of Berlin, between Seydelstr and Beuthstr. Half hi-tech Antarctic Research Station and half rusty broken-dumpster, this unit created by Faithfull provided a station for a group of artists/researchers to investigate the surrounding wilderness and urban zones in Berlin. Other researchers included Esther Polak (Amsterdam), Aug Annika Lundgren (Gothenburg/Berlin), Martin John Callanan, Katie Paterson (London), Nick Crowe & Ian Rawlinson (Manchester/Berlin), Tim Knowles (London). =0¬∫00 Navigation, 2008 and 0¬∫00 Navigation Part II, 2015 = 0¬∫00 Navigation is a black and white film that shows an absurd journey made exactly along the Greenwich Meridian. Always seen from behind, a figure swims out of the seawater where the meridian hits the south-coast of Britain. The solitary person emerges from the water carrying a hand held GPS device. Using this implement the figure then proceeds to walk directly north along the 0¬∫00 line of longitude. Any obstacle encountered is negotiated‚Äîfences climbed, properties crossed, buildings entered via nearest windows or apertures, streams waded, motorways traversed. The figure gradually makes its way up through southeast Britain, through London, the Midlands and ultimately where the line re-enters the water in the north of Britain the figure slowly swims away into the North Sea. Half a decade later Faithfull again traversed the Meridian Line, this time travelling south through Europe and Africa heading towards the exact centre of nowhere. 0¬∫00 Navigation Part II, A Journey Across Europe and Africa premiered at The Edge in Bath and was subsequently presented in a solo exhibition at Sprinhornhof Kunstverein, Germany. A third and final journey tracing the Meridian line across the planet is planned by Faithfull; \\"Eventually he will run out of land and take to sea again, with the ultimate aim of standing on a raft at 0¬∞, 0¬∞ where the meridian meets the equator off the coast of West Africa. \\"I‚Äôm not really a daredevil type\\", he says, \\"and I don‚Äôt actually intend to put myself in danger. I just want to go to these places, partly to see if they really exist\\". =Ice Blink, 2005= Ice Blink was a lecture, exhibition and book commissioned by The Arts Catalyst that collected together the body of work made during a two-month journey to Antarctica in 2004/2005, traveling with the British Antarctic Survey on their research vessel, . This tied in with Faithfull‚Äôs Antarctica Dispatches‚Äîthe initial 'live' drawing project undertaken during the two-month journey. Prior to each of the exhibition openings, Faithfull delivered the Ice Blink lecture in a nearby theatre, drawing on the material he had collected during the course of the journey to illustrate a meandering journey through the myths of polar exploration. =Escape Vehicle No.6, 2004= A domestic chair is attached to a weather balloon and launched into space. Commissioned by The Arts Catalyst as part of the Artists' Airshow 2004. Footage is relayed back to earth as the live audience watches the chair travel 30 km away from the ground and into the edge of space. In 2009 to coincide with his solo exhibition, Gravity Sucks, at the BFI Southbank. =30 km, 2003= A journey into the stratosphere as seen by a video camera attached to a weather balloon. The film starts with the artist's face and then, after releasing the balloon, the shot pulls out, and out until the figure has disappeared into the English landscape. The film ends with a glimpse of the curve of the earth and black space. =Orbital No.1, 2002= Three London circular journeys were recorded in real time and combined into a single, hypnotic, projected circular image. The circular journeys were: the M25 Orbital Motorway, the North and South Circular, and the Circle Line. =Half-life & Half-life Attachments, 2001= Each day a drawing on a palm-pilot was made somewhere in E1, London, and e-mailed back to the Whitechapel Gallery, London. The drawings were then forwarded on to an open list of subscribers as well as progressively inhabiting the gallery in a variety of forms. =Escape Vehicle No.2, 1996= A miniature chair made from spent matches and powered by three dead blue bottles attached to the chair with fuse wire.  Public Art  =Shy Dance- Floor (A dance-floor that only exists when no-one is there), 2015= In the shadows of a pedestrian under-pass, the approaching viewer sees a set of under-floor lights twinkling in the darkness. As they draw nearer, the viewer discovers a 70‚Äôs under-lit dance-floor pulsing silently to an unheard rhythm. Just as the viewer is about to enter the tunnel though, the lights vanish. Shy Dance Floor was presented as a 3-week intervention in a foot-tunnel in Hagen, Germany, as part of the Urban Lights Festival 2015 =Liverpool to Liverpool, 2010= In 2009, Simon Faithfull made a journey from Liverpool (UK) to Liverpool (Nova Scotia), traveling by container ship, train and bus. The artist recorded the everyday minutiae of the journey‚Äî recording the historic paths of trade and exodus. A total of 181 drawings were made and etched into the stone paving and glass of a new public site in Liverpool (UK). =Shy Fountain, (A Fountain That Only Exists When No-One is There) 2008= Shy Fountain has, to date, been realised twice ‚Äì once temporally in the grounds of Haus am Waldsee, Berlin and once as a permanent public art work in Cannon‚Äôs Marsh, Harbour-side, Bristol.

The Eagles compete at the Division I level in the NCAA, but previously have been in the NAIA as well as Division II and III of the NCAA. The team is a member of the Mid-American Conference (MAC), where it has won twenty team championships. Its current head coach, John Goodridge, has won *ten MAC championships in his fifteen years as head coach. *(limited Mac school team participation 2004-2015 vs.1972-2003) His predecessor Bob Parks holds the other nine MAC championships.* (Parks=all Mac school participation, 1972-2000)http://emueagles.com/documents/2009/9/24/MediaGuide.pdf Coaching staff =Early years= Michigan Normal College started a four-man cross country team coached by F. G. Beyerman in 1911. In 1923, Michigan State Normal College became a varsity level sport. The team was coached by the former club athlete, Lloyd Olds. 1929 was the year that Michigan State Normal College had a national champion in the form of Roger Arnett. He won the National AAU Junior Six Mile Cross Country race with a time of 31:33. Teammates Ed Morcombe, Jim O'Connor and Harold Bauer finished third, fourth and fifth respectively. Head coach Lloyd Olds coached for the 1932 Olympic team. His assistant coach George Marshall filled in, and won Michigan State Normal College's seventh straight championship. In 1938, Tom Quinn became the school's first NCAA Division I All-American. Notre Dame delivered the team's first dual meet loss in 1941. This ended a 65-dual meet win streak. This record stands as NCAA's longest streak. Former assistant coach George Marshall officially became the schools second head coach in 1942. MSNC were National Junior AAU champions in 1954. In 1955 Michigan State Normal College changed its name to Eastern Michigan College, then changed it to Eastern Michigan University in 1959. EMU joins the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, NAIA, in 1966, and won their first NAIA title. =Lloyd Olds (1921‚Äì1963)= Olds worked with the Michigan State Normal College track and cross country teams for 25 years. His reputation as an outstanding coach was known throughout the country. Olds developed the Normal School track and field and cross country program into a national power. His cross country squads attained an astounding 926 winning percentage, the highest ever at EMU and one of the highest ever in the country. By the late 1930s, the Michigan State Normal College was known as a track and cross country school. Coach Olds is the sole EMU coach to coach an Olympic team. In 1932 and 1936 Olds was named as assistant track coach to the U. S. Olympic Track and Field Squads. Olds served as chairman of the A.A. U. Track and Field Sections from 1940 to 1943. He was also chairman of the National Track and Field Association from 1946 to 1950. In 1937 he was appointed chairman of the Pan American Athletic Association and later served as manager of the U. S. Pan American Track Squad that competed in Mexico City in 1957, the only EMU coach to serve on an Olympic and Pan American Games teams. While coaching cross country and track and field full-time, Olds taught over thirty different courses in the professional preparation program during his thirty nine years at Eastern. When he retired in 1963 he was still an active member of nineteen professional committees. In addition to the honors already mentioned, Olds received the Eastern Michigan University Distinguished Alumni Award, and was elected to both the N.C.A.A. Track and Field Hall of Fame and the Eastern Michigan University Sports Hall of Fame. In 2004, he was admitted into the Eastern Michigan University College of Education Hall of Fame.http://ypsigleanings.aadl.org/ypsigleanings/15053/ page 1 =George W. Marshall (1928‚Äì1967)= Served as the track and cross country coach for 35 years. Marshall directed EMU's only national cross country national championship, the 1966 NAIA national cross country title. Also led the team to a runner-up finish in the 1965 NCAA-College Division championships. His teams won 14 Interstate Intercollegiate Conference (CCC) championships, still the highest number of championships ever by an EMU coach. Marshall was inducted into the NAIA Hall of Fame in 1968. Eastern's outdoor track named in his honor. Marshall was President of the National Cross Country Coaches' Association in 1951. Prior to his passing in 1967, Marshall hired legendary cross country and track and field coach, Bob Parks. http://www.emueagles.com/hof.aspx?hof=226&path;=&kiosk;= george marshal page 1 =Bob Parks (1967‚Äì2000)= Bob Parks took over as head coach in 1967. In the following five years, each of his teams qualified to either an NAIA Championship meet or NCAA Division II Championship meet. During his first ten seasons at EMU, Parks' teams qualified for the National Championship meet nine times at either NCAA Division I, II or NAIA. In 1972 Eastern Michigan joined the Mid-American Conference and NCAA Division I levels, and transformed the program into a national and conference powerhouse. His star runner early in his career, Gordon Minty, garnered three NCAA Division I All-American honors and Minty gave world-renowned running legend, Steven Prefontaine, a run for his money at the NCAA national championships despite Minty slipping at the start of the race. Parks last recruit, Boaz Cheboiywo, won the NCAA Division I national championship title the year following Parks retirement. Coach Parks is the only EMU cross country coach to coach a long distance Olympian, Dave Ellis, who was in the 1968 Olympics, 10,000m, team Canada. reference.com/olympics/athletes/el/dave-ellis-1.html Two of Parks athletes were USA Olympic team members, (800 meter Bronze medalist, 1984, Earl Jones and 1996 1500 meter runner, Paul McMullen) though middle distance runners, both were big contributors on EMU cross country teams. From 1972-2000, Parks coached 11 MAC cross country champions, the most ever by an EMU coach. Parks coached in the Mid-American Conference during its most competitive era from 1967-2000 when all the schools in the MAC conference competed year-around in cross country, indoor track and outdoor track. He watched the league grow to twelve teams but still managed an incredible nine league championships. By mid-2000-2015, the following Mid American Conference schools had either dropped track and field and cross country completely (western Michigan University, Ohio, Marshall, Bowling Green, Toledo, Miami, Buffalo and Ball State) either leaving the conference or opting to field only cross teams and dropping the sports of indoor or outdoor track and field teams. This attrition of dropped programs, left the MAC cross country league with only four - five, three season running squads, a shadow of the powerful conference. Bob Parks won nine MAC cross country championships, in an era when 100% of Mac school teams participated year around in cross country, indoor and outdoor track. The combination of Parks nine MAC Conference cross country championships, setting the EMU cross country dual meet record and consistently taking his teams to national championships during the Mac Conference most competitive era, is why Parks s referred to as the EMU coaching legend. Parks has been honored with five different hall of fame inductions...Howell high school, Mid-American Conference, Drake Relays, Eastern Michigan University, and the USTFCCCA. =John Goodridge (2001‚Äìpresent)= John Goodridge is a track and field and cross country coach from Long Island, New York. He received his undergraduate degree at Long Island University in 1972, and his graduate degree from the University of Michigan in 1975. His coaching career began as the Michigan State women's cross country head coach, where he took them to their first Big Ten Conference championship. In 1984 he became Wake Forest's Head Cross Country Coach. During his stint at Wake Forest, his teams had four Atlantic Coast Conference championships, as well as coaching 19 athletes to 35 All-ACC honors. In 2001, Goodridge took over as head coach at EMU. In 2002, he took the team to NCAA championships where they placed third. Goodridge went on to lead the Eagles to *6 straight MAC titles from 2010-2016 and *ten MAC titles in ten eleven.*(limited Mac school team participation 2004-2015 vs.1972-2003)http://mac-sports.com/documents/2014/7/7/2013_Season_- _Cross_Country.pdf pages 2-4 References External links * Official site Cross country, men's Category:College cross country teams in the United States Category:1911 establishments in Michigan Category:Sports clubs established in 1911 ","title":"Eastern Michigan Eagles men's cross country"},{"id":"26683053","text":"Stigmella aurella is a moth of the family Nepticulidae.

Existing canals (listed below) were straightened and widened; and new locks (√©cluses) were built, also on the river Escaut, from the junction at Bouchain to the border. The route is also known as the Liaison '√† grand gabarit' (large dimensions, or high capacity, literally large gauge) Dunkerque-Escaut. Some authors have separated the waterway into the canal proper and the canalised river Escaut, but current practice is to use the simple name throughout. The Liaison was designed for large commercial vessels up to 85m long by 11.50m wide (and 143m long push- tows). The entire route is being further upgraded to offer European Class Vb dimensions, for push-tows 185m by 11.50m, and motor barges up to 125m long, as part of the current EU-funded Seine-Escaut-Rhine waterway corridor investments, including the new Seine-Nord Europe Canal. The route The route is made up of nine historically distinct waterways, completed by three new lengths (diversion canals). Starting in the port of Dunkerque, the Mardyck diversion canal connects to the Canal de Bourbourg, which is used for a short length, then the Colme diversion canal leads to the Canal de la Colme, upgraded to Watten where it joins the river Aa from Watten to Arques. The route is then made up of the Canal de Neuffoss√© from Arques to Aire-sur-la-Lys (PK 113-93), the Canal d'Aire from Aire-sur-la-Lys to Bauvin (PK 93-54), the Canal de la De√ªle from Bauvin to Douai (PK 54-32), the Scarpe diversion canal bypassing the narrow river through the town of Douai (PK 32-24), and the Canal de la Sens√©e from Douai to the junction with the Escaut at the Bassin Rond in Bouchain. KP 0 on the Liaison is Pont-Malin lock on the Escaut, 500m beyond this junction. The Escaut is a further 46 km from the lock to the border. The Canal de la De√ªle is also a high-capacity waterway, developed and named as a branch of the Liaison Dunkerque-Escaut from Bauvin to the river Lys, but current practice is to use the historic name (or just \\"De√ªle\\") and to consider it as a separate waterway. The section using the Canal de la Sens√©e comprises the junction with the Canal du Nord and the projected Seine-Nord Europe Canal, which would replace the former canal completed in 1965 to European Class II dimensions.

DPS proteins are part of a complex bacterial defence system that protects DNA against oxidative damage and are distributed widely in the bacterial kingdom.  Description  DPS are highly symmetrical dodecameric proteins of 20 kDa characterized from a shell-like structure of 2:3 tetrahedral symmetry assembled from identical subunits with an external diameter of ~ 9 nm and a central cavity of ~ 4.5 nm in diameter. Dps proteins belong to the ferritin superfamily and the DNA protection is afforded by means of a double mechanism: The first was discovered in Escherichia coli Dps in 1992 and has given the name to the protein family; during stationary phase, Dps binds the chromosome non-specifically, forming a highly ordered and stable dps-DNA co-crystal within which chromosomal DNA is condensed and protected from diverse damages. The lysine-rich N-terminus is required for self- aggregation as well as for Dps-driven DNA condensation. The second mode of protection is due to the ability of Dps proteins to bind and oxidize Fe(II) at the characteristic, highly conserved intersubunit ferroxidase center. The dinuclear ferroxidase centers are located at the interfaces between subunits related by 2-fold symmetry axes. Fe(II) is sequestered and stored in the form of Fe(III) oxyhydroxide mineral, which can be released after reduction. In the mineral iron core up to 500 Fe(III) can be deposited. One hydrogen peroxide oxidizes two Fe2+ ions, which prevents hydroxyl radical production by the Fenton reaction (reaction I): 2 Fe2+ \\\\+ H2O2 \\\\+ 2 H+ = 2 Fe3+ \\\\+ 2 H2O Dps also protects the cell from UV and gamma ray irradiation, iron and copper toxicity, thermal stress and acid and base shocks. Also shows a weak catalase activity.  DNA condensation  Dps dodecamers can condense DNA in vitro through a cooperative binding mechanism. Deletion of portions of the N-terminus or mutation of key lysine residues in the N-terminus can impair or eliminate the condensation activity of Dps. Single molecule studies have shown that Dps-DNA complexes can get trapped in long-lived metastable states that exhibit hysteresis. Because of this, the extent of DNA condensation by Dps can depend not only on the current buffer conditions but also on the conditions in the past. A modified Ising model can be used to explain this binding behavior.  Expression  In Escherichia coli Dps protein is Induced by rpoS and IHF in the early stationary phase. Dps is also Induced by oxyR in response to oxidative stress during exponential phase. ClpXP probably directly regulate proteolysis of dps during exponential phase. ClpAP seems to play an indirect role in maintaining ongoing dps synthesis during stationary phase  Applications  Cavities formed by Dps and ferritin proteins have been successfully used as the reaction chamber for the fabrication of metal nanoparticles (NPs). Protein shells served as a template to restrain particle growth and as a coating to prevent coagulation/aggregation between NPs. Using various sizes of protein shells, various sizes of NPs can be easily synthesized for chemical, physical and bio-medical applications.

Its mandate ensures future generations may hear directly from those who served to better understand the realities of war. It is a special project of the American Folklife Center, a research center of the Library of Congress. The program is conducted through Congressional offices and relies on a national network of veteran service organizations, universities, secondary schools, community groups and the general public to record interviews according to program guidelines. These and original letters, diaries, photos, memoirs and historic documents related to a veteran's wartime service are then preserved at the Library of Congress. Through 2010 the project held more than 65,000 collections and was considered the largest oral history program of its kind in the nation. It serves as an important resource for scholars, historians, students and the general public. The Veterans History Project authorizing legislation (Public Law 106-380) was sponsored by Representatives Ron Kind, Amo Houghton, and Steny Hoyer in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senators Max Cleland and Chuck Hagel in the U.S. Senate.

Denier Warren. It is the second in the Old Mother Riley series of films, and is also known by its re-release title, Old Mother Riley Catches a Quisling. Synopsis Old Mother Riley is sacked from her job as a step cleaner at the office where her daughter Kitty works. She goes home to make steak and kidney pudding for their lodger, Joe, who is vaguely engaged to Kitty, but distractedly pours castor oil into the gravy, with amusing results. Jo is not sure he wants to be tied down to Kitty (or her impossible mother) and arranges for his travel agency employers to post him to Paris for six months, much to Kitty's discomfiture. While changing a light bulb, Old Mother Riley has a fall from a stepladder, resulting in her hospitalisation: keen to claim the maximum amount on her insurance she alters her medical records for the worse, only to be carried off for an emergency operation when the doctors see how much appears to be \\"wrong\\" with her. However, the ruse works: just as bailiffs are arriving to remove all Old Mother Riley's furniture, her insurance agent arrives with ¬£250 in cash, which she uses to pay off her rental arrears and treat Kitty and herself to an air flight to Paris, in order to check up on Joe, who has meanwhile become involved with a suspicious young Parisian lady (really a spy with code name \\"Madame Zero\\", who believes he is an English agent). Old Mother Riley, terrified by the air flight, parachutes out of the plane and on landing is taken to a Paris police station, where the Commissioner locks her up as the suspected spy \\"Madame Zero\\". She escapes and joins Kitty in their luxurious Paris hotel, where they cause chaos (and a custard pie fight) in the restaurant, by mistakenly ordering a trolley-ful of trifles. Checking up on Joe, they find him dancing in a caf√© with \\"Madame Zero\\". Kitty is heartbroken, and Old Mother Riley drags her rival to the police station, demanding the woman should be locked up for alienating Joe's affections. When it emerges that the girl is in fact the mysterious \\"Madame Zero\\", Old Mother Riley is awarded a medal by the French authorities. She and Kitty return to England (by boat) and are joined by the repentant Joe, finally welcomed into the household by Old Mother Riley, who toasts the couple with champagne which she has smuggled through customs.

Silurian characterized by short, essentially straight shells referred to as breviconic, typically with a faintly exogastric shape produced by the profile of the body chamber. Apertures vary from round to T-shaped, with a long narrow, ventral, hyponomic sinus for the maneuvering funnel. Siphuncles are commonly central or subcentral with generally broad, expanded, segments and usually thin connecting rings. The narrow hyponomic sinus, which is an opening for the water-jet funnel by which the animal could move, much as with modern squid and octopods, points toward the lower or ventral side. The cross bar of the \\"T\\" or the round part of the aperture through which the animal could extend itself is located closer to the back or dorsal part of the shell. Phylogeny The Mandaloceratidae are derived from the Reudemannoceratidae through Madiganella. The earliest mandeloceratid is Pseudogomphoceras which gave rise to Ovocerina. Ovocerina gave rise to Cinctoceras, Umbeloceras, Verspoeras, and Mandaloceras. It also gave rise to the Mesoceratidae representing Mesoceras. Genera Mandaloceras is the type genus of the Mandaloceratidae characterized by straight or somewhat curved shells with a slightly depressed cross section (width greater than height) and a constricted T-shaped aperture. The siphncle is subcentral and increases rapidly in width during the life of the animal. Segments are broad with thin connecting rings. Cinctoceras is a large mandaloceratid with a breviconic shell that tends to be dorsally flattened, making its cross section slightly depressed; a constricted T-shape aperture and sphuncle segments that are short and broad. Ovocerina is a small breviconic mandaloceratid with an exogastric aspect produced by the more convenxly rounded lower (ventral) side and a rounded or transversely extended aperture that approaches the T-shaped aperture of Mandaloceras. The siphuncle is displaced slightly, either ventrally or dorsally from the center. Segments, composed of thin connecting rings, are broadly expanded. Pseudogomphoceras is a large, atypically longiconic mandeloceratid that reflects its reudemannoceratid ancestry. The subcentral siphuncle contains vesicular deposits and a central tube. Otherwise it is like Ovoverina. Umbelloceras is a small breviconic mandaloceratid with a cross section ranging from slightly depressed to slightly compressed (width > height to width < height) and a T-shaped aperture in which the two lateral branches curve toward the venter. Vesperoceras is a medium size, generally straight, breviconic mandaloceratid with a broad annular expansion to the anterior part of the phragmocone followed by a constriction at the base of the body chamber. The siphuncle is located midway between the center and venter. Segments are moderately to strongly expanded. The aperture may be open or constricted. Mandaloceras was named by Hyatt in Zittel 1900. The rest were named by Rousseau Flower, Ovocerina in 1947, Cinctoceras, Pseudogomphoceras, Umbelloceras, and Vesperoceras in Flower and Teichert, 1957. With the exception of Mandaloceras, which is also found in North America, the Mandeloceratidae are restricted to the Silurian of Europe. References *Flower, R.H. & Teichert, C. 1957.

Goniopora, often called flowerpot coral, is a genus of colonial stony coral found in lagoons and turbid water conditions. Goniopora have numerous daisy-like polyps that extend outward from the base, each tipped with 24 stinging tentacles which surrounds a mouth. Distribution Species of Goniopora can be found in the Persian Sea areas, the Indian Ocean, and various tropical and subtropical areas of the Pacific Ocean. Various species live as far north as Hong Kong (where they are the dominant colonial non-reef-building coral) and southern Japan. Care Goniopora is a sensitive coral that when probed can sensitise and contract . Goniopora are a very difficult coral to keep alive and are not recommended for a novice reef aquarium hobbyist. The short, greenish-colored species are less sturdy and durable than the pink or purple species.http://reefcorner.com/reef- database-index/large-polyp-stony-coral-index/purple-goniopora-coral/ Many precautions must be taken to raise Goniopora. First, they require moderate to high lighting, depending on species. They must also have some water movement so their polyps can move freely. However, it should not be directed right at the polyps or the movement might be too vigorous. The water temperature must remain between . There must be adequate amounts of calcium and iron in the tank to help skeletal development. Placement in the tank is also crucial. They must be well positioned on a sturdy rock to avoid damaging falls. When placing Goniopora they must have enough room to grow and move their tentacles. Goniopora should be monitored for shriveling after being moved to a new tank to make sure they are getting enough sunlight. Feeding Goniopora are avid feeders susceptible to death from nutritional deficiencies. There are many different ways to feed Goniopora. For example, they can be directly fed with a syringe (avoiding a hard, straight flow into the polyps or that triggers them to close up) or food can be sprinkled on the top of the tank and let to reach the Goniopora on its own. However, direct feeding seems to work best. Alternately, plankton can be placed in the tank with all filtration systems off so the food does not get swept away. The filters should be turned back on after one to two hours to keep the tank clean and livable for all of the creatures. Goniopora need foods high in manganese and iron. Fragging Goniopora grow daughter cells in a type of asexual reproduction called fragging. The mother corals have wounds from the daughter corals that usually heal up in about two weeks. The daughter corals grow about 1 millimeter a month. Some scientists suggest that the daughter Goniopora live inside cells of the mother coral before breaking out and growing on their own Issues There are many issues that go along with keeping Goniopora. The first one is that it is very hard to locate and buy, especially the red species. Goniopora may grow in murky or clear water depending on the species. Because different species have such different requirements, it adds to the challenge of keeping them alive.

The event draws crowds from all over Michigan and its surrounding states, with attendance often topping 100,000 over the three-day weekend. The festival is hosted by the Howell Area Chamber of Commerce, and Balloonfest Director Michelle Tokan. The 36th annual Michigan Challenge Balloonfest was postponed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 36th edition of the event will now take place in 2021. Annual attractions The festival starts each year on Friday afternoon with the opening of the carnival. Being right on Grand River, the lights make a spectacle for anyone driving through the downtown area every night. Friday night also features a fireworks display, as of the 2009 festival, sponsored by MediLodge of Howell. The Arts Festival held next to the Howell High School main campus goes on for the entire weekend and attracts vendors selling anything from crafts to hand-painted artwork. Saturday morning the day starts early with the balloon fly-in. In downtown Howell, the St. Joseph Mercy Hospital kids day, held on the lawn of the historical Howell Courthouse, features demonstrations such as karate and dancing. One of the favorite events of the festival is held late on Saturday night each year, the balloon night glow. After the evening launch, the pilots all come back to the launch field and re-inflate their balloons, then led by a countdown, they all light their torches together and the crowd is treated to all the balloons glowing together on the field. Annual launches There are several mass balloon launches scheduled each year. Each flight is weather dependent on many factors, such as rain and wind. On Friday night, the balloons all launch from the Howell High School Freshman Campus main launch field. On both Saturday and Sunday morning, pilots will partake in multiple competitions, most of the time involving flying into the main field and attempting to drop a marker (bean bag with a ripstop nylon tail) onto one or multiple large targets that have been placed where pilots would normally take off from, as well as other locations around the city. Many Howell natives enjoy waking up to this impressive show of navigation, skill, and patience. Saturday evening holds another mass launch, followed by the famous Balloon Glow, where 20-25 pilots return to the launchfield to light up their balloons in the evening's darkness to the delight of the crowd. Sunday evening holds a farewell mass launch to close the event. Sponsors To date, the event is sponsored by Advanced Disposal, Citizens Insurance, and Howell Public Schools. MediLodge of Howell annually sponsors the fireworks display, while PepsiCo is the major beverage sponsor of the event, and Suburban Propane is the official propane sponsor. Past sponsors have included PNC Bank, Father & Son Construction, and Cleary University.

Naxal Varghese is especially notable in the history of Kerala, for being murdered by the police in a fake encounter, and the truth of this incident which remained unknown for 40 years. After 40 years, the very policeman who fired the shot revealed to the world that he had murdered him, and called for a trial. In the course of the trial, the now-old policeman died before he could testify before the court. A colleague of his testified, and one senior police officer who ordered the murder was convicted and sentenced by the court. Other Naxalites who worked with him were Ajitha, and Grow Vasu. Naxal life Varghese along with many others fought against the misuse and exploitation of illiterate adivasi people of Wayanad in 1960s. The Naxalites assassinated many landlords including Adiga, Chekku and distributed the assets gained from this landlords to the poor. The police tried to suppress it with power and by 1970 the protest was very weakened. On February 17, 1970 Varghese sought shelter and food from Karimath Sivaraman Nair. While he was asleep someone informed police and he was arrested. His body was later found at Koomparakuni near to Thirunelli police station. The Church refused to bury his body and he was later buried at his ancestral home at Ozhukkan moola in Vellamunda. Murder Police constable P. Ramachandran Nair admitted publicly in 1998 that he had shot Varghese on orders of Lakshmana, then a deputy superintendent of police. A gun was planted on the dead body to imply that he had been shot dead in an encounter with the police. On 28 October 2010, in a historic judgement a special CBI court found former police officer K. Lakshmana guilty of compelling Ramachandran Nair to shoot Varghese and was sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of ten thousand rupees. The verdict was later upheld by the Kerala High Court. Legacy Varghese is often called 'Kerala Che Guevara', comparing him with the iconic Cuban communist revolutionary, because of the similarity of work he undertook for the underprivileged and the similarity in the circumstances of death.

The Art of Racing in the Rain is a 2008 novel by American author Garth Stein --told from a dog's point of view. The novel was a New York Times bestseller for 156 weeks.  Summary  The novel follows the story of Denny Swift, a race car driver and customer representative in a Seattle BMW dealership, and his dog, Enzo, who believes in the legend that a dog \\"who is prepared\\" will be reincarnated in his next life as a human. Enzo sets out to prepare, with The Seattle Times calling his journey \\"a struggle to hone his humanness, to make sense of the good, the bad and the unthinkable.\\" Enzo spends most of his days watching and learning from television, gleaning what he can about his owner's greatest passion, race car driving--and relating it to life. He watches as Denny marries Eve, the birth of their daughter, Zoe, and then Eve's development of brain cancer, which only he can detect through his acute sense of smell. Enzo eventually plays a key role in Denny's child-custody battle with his in-laws and distills his observations of the human condition in the mantra \\"that which you manifest is before you.\\" Enzo helps Denny throughout his life, through his ups and downs, and gets Zoe back.  Background  Inspiration for the novel came after Stein watched the 1998 Mongolian documentary State of Dogs, and then later in 2004 heard poet Billy Collins give a reading of the poem \\"The Revenant\\" told from a dog's point of view. Stein had originally named the dog \\"Juan Pablo\\" after Colombian race car driver Juan Pablo Montoya, but changed his name at the suggestion of his wife, naming the dog instead after Enzo Ferrari, founder of the famous Italian automobile marque of the same name. The race car driving experience of the novel's character, Denny, is based on Stein's own experience in racing cars, and on another race car driver who is a close friend of Stein's who was dealing with some family turbulence at the time. Stein moved from New York City to Seattle in 2001 and became involved in \\"high performance driver education,\\" received his racing license with the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA), and won the points championship in the Northwest region Spec Miata class in 2003. Stein left racing after crashing while racing in the rain. Film adaptation Universal Pictures acquired the rights to the novel in July 2009, for Patrick Dempsey to star in. The project was unable to find a director. After the project came to a halt with Universal Studios, Disney acquired the rights in January 2016. The film adaptation will be produced by Neal Moritz. In 2017, screenwriter Mark Bomback revealed that the project was now set up at Fox 2000, saying, \\"I'm hoping the third time's the charm, and I'm optimistic that next year will be when it finally goes into production.\\" The film was released on August 9, 2019, by 20th Century Fox. It is the first 20th Century Fox film to be marketed on the Walt Disney Studios' official website since the acquisition of the studio by Disney. Milo Ventimiglia and Amanda Seyfried play Denny and Eve, respectively, while Enzo is voiced by Kevin Costner.

The cover graphic of the video has a black and white monotone portrait picture of Makmende placing a red head band across his forehead with the words MAKMENDE AMERUDI which is Swahili for MAKMENDE IS BACK. The role of Makmende on the video was played by graphics designer Kevin Maina, who had little previous acting experience. As of April 2010, the Makmende website (now offlined) was one of the most visited by Kenyan Internet users, and the meme had a quickly growing fanbase on Facebook and Twitter. The Makmende story has also featured on CNN and was presented by CNN's David McKenzie. Makmende has also featured in articles in popular Kenyan media.

GameSpot's Justin Calvert felt that the course creation tools were easy to use and stated the game \\"has the potential to keep you playing for weeks and months as more player-created and downloadable content is added.\\" The reviewer from Game Revolution noted that he preferred looking for difficult courses created by players in order to maintain a challenge. He stated players will \\"have access to literally thousands of different holes to shoot in hundreds of custom courses.\\" The multiplayer component also received generally positive remarks. \\"Multiplayer modes, community features, and the course editor give you plenty to do\\" stated IGN's Daemon Hatfield. Justin Calvert of GameSpot also praised the game's ability to upload replays to YouTube. Critics generally had mixed opinions on Planet Minigolfs visuals, and some cited issues with the game's camera. The reviewer from Game Revolution felt that the game's graphics were \\"very pretty for a downloadable title\\". IGN's Daemon Hatfield also felt that the character models were well done, but cited \\"hiccups\\" with the camera. Adrenaline Vault reviewer James Dolbeare felt that the graphics were inconsistent. He stated \\"characters are rendered well, whereas environments are often flat, pixilated, or simply lack detail.\\" The Stronghold Island downloadable content was moderately received as well, though it sold over 3,300 units in its first month of release. Tina Amini of Gaming Nexus gave it a lukewarm reception, and gave it a C grade. Amini cited strong \\"visual story telling\\" but noted that poor camera angles continued to be a flaw in the downloadable content. She praised the course design and visuals and stated they were \\"quite beautiful\\" but called the choice of music cheesy and \\"reminiscent of an outdated game show.\\" References External links * Category:2010 video games Category:Miniature golf video games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 3-only games Category:PlayStation Move-compatible games Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment games Category:Video games developed in Hungary Category:Zen Studios games ","title":"Planet Minigolf"},{"id":"26683314","text":"Stigmella aurora is a moth of the family Nepticulidae.

The expedition was allegedly in retaliation for a French and Indian raid against the Massachusetts frontier community of Deerfield earlier that year. Departing Boston on 25 May 1704 with 500 provincial militia and some Indian allies, the expedition reached the Minas Basin on 24 June, after raiding smaller settlements at Penobscot Bay and Passamaquoddy Bay. Although he lost surprise due to the famously high tides of the Bay of Fundy, Church quickly gained control of Grand-Pr√©, and spent three days destroying the town and attempting to destroy the dikes and levees that protected its croplands. The croplands were flooded by salt water, but the local Acadians quickly repaired the dikes after the raiders left, and the land was returned to production. Church continued his raiding expedition, striking at Beaubassin and other communities before finally returning to Boston in late July. Context When the War of the Spanish Succession (also called Queen Anne's War) widened to include England in 1702, it spawned conflict between the colonies of England and France in North America. Joseph Dudley, the governor of the English Province of Massachusetts Bay (which then included present-day Maine), sought in June 1703 to ensure the neutrality of the Abenakis who occupied the frontier between Massachusetts and New France. In this he was unsuccessful, because New France's Governor Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil, knowing he would have to rely on Indian support for defense against the more numerous English, had already encouraged the Indians to take up the hatchet. Following the Wabanaki Confederacy of Acadia military campaign against the New England frontier during the summer of 1703, the English colonists embarked on largely unsuccessful retaliatory raids against Abenaki villages. This prompted the Abenakis to participate in a raid on Deerfield, Massachusetts under French leadership in February 1704. The severity of this raid (more than 50 villagers killed and more than 100 captured) prompted calls for revenge, and the veteran Indian fighter Benjamin Church offered his services for an expedition against the French colony of Acadia (roughly present-day Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and eastern Maine). Acadia was at the time dominated by a series of settlements dotting the shores of the Bay of Fundy and its adjacent bays. Its principal settlement and capital, Port Royal, was the only significantly fortified community, defended by a star fort with a modest garrison. The land at the top of the bay, on the shores of the Minas and Cumberland Basins was one of the major seats of food production in the colony, and Grand Pr√© was one of the largest and most successful communities on the Minas Basin, with a population of about 500 in 1701. French settlers to the area had brought with them knowledge on the constructions of dikes and levees, which they used to drain marshlands for agriculture, and to protect those lands from the inflow of the exceptionally high tides (over 6 meters, or 20 feet, in some places) for which the Bay of Fundy is well known. The community of Beaubassin was the largest of several towns situated on the Isthmus of Chignecto and elsewhere on the shores of the Cumberland Basin. Start of the expedition Grand Pr√© was raided in retaliation for the Raid on Deerfield, depicted here Church had previously led expeditions against Acadia during King William's War, and Governor Dudley issued him a colonel's commission for the effort, giving him specific orders to obtain Acadian prisoners that could be exchanged for the English prisoners taken in the Deerfield raid. The expedition was also to be one of punishment: \\"Use all possible methods for the burning and destroying of the enemies houses and breaking the dams of their corn grounds, and make what other spoil you can upon them\\". Dudley, however, specifically denied Church permission to attack Port Royal, the Acadian capital, citing the need to get permission from London before taking such a step. The force Church raised consisted of about 500 volunteers from coastal areas of Massachusetts, including some Indians. He left Boston on 15/26 May with fourteen transports and three warships. The warships include the Royal Navy vessels , (42 guns) and (32), which were also accompanied by the Massachusetts Province Galley of Cyprian Southack. (Church took a former prisoner of the Maliseet, John Gyles as his translator.) The expedition first sailed for Mount Desert Island, near the entrance to Penobscot Bay. Church sent a force to raid Pentagoet (present-day Castine, Maine), where the Frenchman Baron Saint-Castin had a fortified trading post. Saint-Castin was absent, but Church took prisoner his daughter and her children. He also learned that a new French settlement was being built at Passamaquoddy Bay, so the expedition next sailed for that destination. Church sent a small force ashore near present-day St. Stephen, New Brunswick, where they destroyed a house and raided a nearby Maliseet encampment, killing one Indian. Church then separated the warships, sending them to blockade the Digby Gut in the hopes of capturing a French supply ship, while the bulk of the expedition sailed for Grand Pr√©. The three ship captains on 24 June demanded the surrender of the garrison at Port Royal, threatening a frontal assault with 1,700 New Englanders and \\"Sauvages\\". Governor Jacques-Fran√ßois de Monbeton de Brouillan, despite defenses in poor conditions and a garrison of only 150 able men, saw through the bluff and refused. Historian George Rawlyk speculates that Governor Dudley may have intentionally asked them to make this bluff without Church's involvement. Grand Pr√© Detail from an 18th-century map showing the English expedition's movements up to its arrival at Grand Pr√© and Port Royal The principal detailed account of these events was provided by Colonel Church in his memoirs, first published in 1716. French military officers later summarized the damage caused by the raiders. =Day 1: Arrival= On 24 June/3 July 1704, Church arrived at Grand Pr√© on the frigate Adventure. Hoping to take advantage of the element of surprise, Church secretly approached the village from behind the heavily wooded Boot Island. His men unloaded the whaleboats to go ashore late in the day and started to move quickly toward the village. Church sent Lieut. Giles ahead with a flag of truce and a written notice demanding the village's complete surrender. Church stipulated the Acadians and Mi'kmaq had one hour to surrender. Although he expected to reach the village by the time the hour had past, Church's force became delayed by stream crossings made more difficult by the receding tide: \\"But meeting with several creeks near twenty or thirty feet deep, which were very muddy and dirty, so that the army could not get over them, were obliged to return to their boats again.\\" Because Church's forces were stuck in the mud exposed by the retreating tide, they lost any element of surprise, and the Acadians took the opportunity to evacuate Grand Pr√© with some of their cattle and the \\"best of their goods\\". Church's forces waited in their boats for the tide to rise. Church expected the high stream banks to provide some cover, but when tide rose that night, it was so high that the boats were exposed to gunfire from the local militia, who had gathered in the woods along the banks. According to Church, the Acadians and Mi'kmaq \\"fired smartly at our forces\\". Church had a small cannon on his boat, which he used to fire grape shot at the attackers on the shore, who withdrew, suffering one Mi'kmaq killed and several wounded. Church's forces then waited out the rest of the night. =Day 2: Inhabitants driven off= Raid on Grand Pre (1704) Having withdrawn from the village, the next morning the Acadian and Mi'kmaq militia waited in the woods for Church and his men to arrive. At the break of day, the New Englanders again set off toward the village, under orders from Church to drive any resistance before them. The largest body of defenders fired on the raiders' right flank from behind trees and logs, but their fire was ineffective and they were driven off. The raiders then entered the village and began plundering. Some of the men broke into the liquor stores they found and began drinking, but Colonel Church quickly put a stop to that activity. They spent the rest of the day destroying much of the village. According to one of Church's dispatches, they destroyed 60 houses, 6 mills, and many barns, along with about 70 cattle. At one point some of the men noticed that some of the Acadians were nearby, driving off some of their cattle. Church detached Lieutenant Barker and some men to give chase, warning them to advance with care. However, Barker was somewhat rash in pursuing the chase, and he and another man were killed before the raiders retreated back to the village. That evening the raiders built a fortification out of logs while burning the church and the rest of the village. Church reported that \\"the whole town seemed to be on fire all at once.\\" All but one home was burned. =Day 3: Destruction of the harvest= Detail from an 18th-century map annotated to show the English expedition's movements after the raid On the morning of the third day, Church gave the orders to destroy the dykes and, in turn, all of the crops. Seven dykes were broken, destroying most of the harvest and ruining over 200 hogsheads of stored wheat. To give the impression to the Acadians and Mi'kmaq that his forces were leaving, Church had his soldiers burn the fortifications they had built the day before. He also had them load themselves and the whale boats back onto their transport vessels. Some of the Acadians returned in the night and immediately began to mend the broken dykes. However, Church had anticipated this, and sent men back to the town to drive the Acadians off. End of the expedition The next day Church left Grand Pr√© and went on to raid Pisiguit (present day Windsor and Falmouth, Nova Scotia, not far from Grand Pr√©), where he took 45 prisoners. He then sailed for Port Royal to rejoin the fleet blockading Port Royal. According to uncorroborated French reports, the blockaders had made some landings in the vicinity of Port Royal, burning a few isolated houses and taking some prisoners. Governor Brouillan organized defenses that successfully prevented further landings. Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley After rejoining the warships Church held a council to discuss whether or not to launch a large-scale attack against Port Royal. The council decided that their force was \\"inferiour to the strength of the enemy\\", and that they would \\"quit it [Port Royal] wholly and go about [their] other business\\". The expedition then sailed back up the Bay of Fundy to Chignecto, where the village of Beaubassin was raided. Its inhabitants had by then been alerted to the English activities, and under the leadership of Father Claude Trouve had removed their possessions and as much livestock as possible from the village to Chedabucto (Guysborough, Nova Scotia). Church, after some ineffectual skirmishing with villagers hiding in the woods, burned the village's houses and barns and slaughtered 100 head of cattle, before sailing for Boston. Church reported that six of his men were killed over the course of the expedition.<  Aftermath  The prisoners that Church took were brought to Boston, where they were at first given relatively free access to the town. The town selectman complained, and the Acadians were then confined to Castle William. They were exchanged in 1705 and 1706 for prisoners taken in the Deerfield raid, although the negotiations were complicated by Dudley's initial refusal to release the noted French privateer Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste, who was ultimately exchanged, along with Noel Doiron and other captives, for Deerfield's minister John Williams. The direct effects of the raid were fairly short-lived. Because of the destruction of the crop and stored grain, the colony suffered a flour shortage that winter, although it was not severe enough to cause significant hardship. Grand Pr√© was rebuilt, the dykes were repaired, and there was a successful harvest in 1706. The memory of the raid however, lasted in the population. As late as the 1740s (after Acadia had become British Nova Scotia) Grand Pr√©'s inhabitants worried about a return of English raiders, and were cautious in their dealing with British authorities. Dudley's decision to deny Church permission to attack Port Royal had political ramifications: his opponents in Massachusetts accused him of protecting Port Royal because he was benefiting from illicit trade with Acadia. These allegations continued for several years, and Dudley eventually chose to deal with them by launching the failed attacks on Port Royal in 1707.

Dadan Island (Tatan, Taitan Island, Tae- tan/Taetan) (, originally ) is an island in Lieyu Township, Kinmen County (Quemoy), Fujian Province, Republic of China (Taiwan). The island is in the Taiwan Strait, along the coast of Mainland China. It is located approximately to the southwest of Lesser Kinmen (Lieyu) and approximately from Xiamen (Amoy). History Dadan Island (labelled ) In March 1853, HMS Rattler struck a sunken rock at Amoy, China and was severely damaged. She was beached at Tae- tan (Dadan) for repairs. Since 1949, Dadan Island has several times become the battlefront of conflicts between the People's Liberation Army and the Republic of China Armed Forces. On July 26, 1950, ROC forces on the island, in total 298 soldiers, repulsed an attack (Â§ßÊìîÂ≥∂Êà∞ÂΩπ) from a People's Liberation Army force of 700 soldiers that landed on the island. In October 1951, Chiang Ching-kuo visited the island and gave the island its current name. Chinese Nationalist spokesmen reported that Chinese Communists shelled Dadan and Erdan between June 26-28, 1957. At that time, Chinese Nationalist strength on the islands was around 1,100 men. On May 9-10, 2002, President Chen Shui-bian visited Dadan (Tatan) and delivered remarks concerning Cross-Strait relations. On 30 June 2014, the control of the island and surrounding islets was handed over from the Republic of China Armed Forces to the civilian under the Coast Guard Administration of Kinmen County Government.http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/local/offshore- islands/2014/06/29/411213/Outlying-Kinmen.htm From 26 July until 31 October 2018, the island was opened to the public on trial basis which attracted 3,000 people in total. On 1 March 2019, the island was officially opened for tourism. A maximum of 150 people can visit the island on a given day and sight-seers must apply for permission to visit ten days before their visit. Residents of Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau are prohibited from visiting the island. Geography The total surface area of Dadan Island is . The northern and southern part of the island are more elevated than its central area, which contains a strip of sandy beach. Mountains on the island include Beishan ('north mountain', Mt. Beishan; ) which reaches above sea level, Mt. Xiaohu ('little tiger mountain', Mt. Siaohu; ) which reaches above sea level, and Nanshan ('south mountain', Mt.

California's artisan vignerons Thackrey has been described as an unconventional winemaker who has done pioneering work in promoting California Syrah.Nalley, Richard, Food & Wine (April 2000). Syrah: The Next Big GrapeGray, W. Blake, San Francisco Chronicle (October 21, 2004). Medieval man Career Thackrey studied art history at Reed College in Portland, OR, and the University of Vienna, but without graduating. He moved to Bolinas in 1964 and for a while worked as a book editor for the Sierra Club. In 1970, Thackrey, with Susan Thackrey and Cynthia Pritzker, opened the art gallery in San Francisco that became Thackrey & Robertson, by then in partnership with watercolorist Sally Robertson; the gallery remained operational until it closed in 1995. Thackrey's particular expertise was in early photography, in exhibiting which the gallery was an internationally renowned pioneer. After several years in Berkeley and San Francisco, Thackrey moved back to Bolinas in 1977. Following initial winemaking experiments with Cabernet Sauvignon grapes purchased from Fay Vineyard in Napa Valley, Thackrey became a bonded winemaker in 1981, as the Thackrey & Co. winery. Some early problems with lactobacillus led Thackrey to take extension courses at UC Davis, although he states he has little use for the scientific approach to winemaking. Thackrey sources fruit from grape growers in Napa Valley, Marin County and Mendocino,Lombard, Jacqueline, New York Herald (April 27, 2009). Sean Thackrey, Anti- \\"Terroirist and is prone to employ the unconventional technique of letting grapes 'rest' at least 24 hours outside, fermenting under the stars. Thackrey contends the idea can be traced to the texts of the Greek poet Hesiod, Works and Days (circa 700 B.C.). Not employed by anyone else at present, Thackrey claims this method was commonplace in wine literature until the middle of the 19th century. Wines Thackrey's first vintage in 1981, a Merlot/Cabernet Sauvignon blend named Aquila, had an initial production of .Associated Press, Los Angeles Times (December 13, 1988). Tiny California Winery Awash in Praise but not Profit Thackrey's flagship wine is Orion (Sean Thackrey Orion Rossi Vineyard St. Helena California Native Red Wine), produced from 1986-1990 using Syrah grapes from Arthur Schmidt's old vine vineyard near Yountville until this was bought by Clarke Swanson, and since 1992 from the Rossi vineyard in St. Helena, planted in 1905. Thackrey is uncertain what grape varieties are in the field blend, as UC Davis researchers have attempted a vineyard test without certain conclusions.\\" The experimental nonvintage blend Pleiades (Sean Thackrey Pleiades California Red Table Wine) was first released in 1992. Made from a host of different grape varieties (potentially both white and red, such as Syrah, Barbera, Zinfandel, Carignan, Pinot noir, Mourv√®dre and Grenache), potentially from different regions and different vintages. The recipe changes every year, depending on the decisions of Thackrey and the fruit sourced. Thackrey has said, \\"It's like a chef's special.

Thackrey has an output of approximately annually. Exposure Despite Thackrey's fringe profile, he has consistently received high scores from major critics such as Robert Parker. Although Thackrey has never advertised his wines, customer demand for his wines considerably outweighs his small-scale production.Heimoff, Steve, steveheimoff.com (January 7, 2010). A thoughtful visit to the far Marin coast Occasionally voicing opinions contrary to conventional belief, Thackrey does not consider terroir to be the most important element in creating fine wine, having said, \\"I'm not saying terroir doesn't exist, there are just a lot of other things going on\\".Holbrook, Stett, Los Angeles Times (January 28, 2004). Who needs terroir? Thackrey has described AVAs and appellations as a \\"gerrymandered marketing gimmick\\", and the AOCs of France as \\"viticultural racism\\". Having termed himself an agnostic about terroir, he has also stated he is agnostic about global warming, adding, \\"The real story is a greater willingness to deal with cooler regions. Remember that Carneros was once considered absolutely marginal. Fifty years ago, nobody would have dreamed to plant grapes there\\". Thackrey's website holds what is titled \\"The Thackrey Library\\", which includes an extensive archive of early books and manuscripts relating to the subject of winemaking and the enjoyment of wine.Comiskey, Patrick, Los Angeles Times (February 22, 2006).

Mission statement Art and Sacred Places ‚Äì Creative Conversations ‚Äì Commissions exciting and innovative work from contemporary artists for sacred places. ‚Äì Stimulates creative dialogue through encounters with art and the sacred. ‚Äì Widens vision through education and participation. History Art and Sacred Places was founded under the auspices of the Rt Revd John Gladwin at that time the Anglican Bishop of Guildford. The organisation, then known as Art 2000, formed in 1998 and became a Charitable Unincorporated Association in May 2001 under the name Art and Sacred Places. In June 2014 it became a Charitable Incorporated Organisation. The Very Revd Stephen Waine, Dean of Chichester, became President in 2015. The organisation's patrons include the broadcaster Andrew Graham-Dixon. Development and projects Since its formation Art and Sacred Places has had several notable programmes of work. The first programme was the 1999 'Seeing the Light' exhibition organised, using existing work, in Portsmouth Cathedral, Guildford Cathedral and Chichester Cathedral. The Chichester exhibition included Jerwood Sculpture Prize 2004 short-listed artist Simon Hitchens. In 2000 'Projects in Sacred Places' was organised with specially commissioned work. For this initiative, which took place across four Cathedrals and a Brighton Church, of particular note was the Richard Wentworth work 'Recall' for Winchester Cathedral. A catalogue was produced with essays by Sacha Craddock and Father Friedhelm Mennekes. For the 2003/4 series Turner Prize 2007 nominee Nathan Coley exhibited 'Black Tent' in Portsmouth Cathedral; Lithuanian Venice Biennale 2001 artist Deimantas Narkevicius exhibited 'The Role of a Lifetime' in St Peter's Church, Brighton and Rose Finn-Kelcey created 'Angel' for St Paul's Church in Bow Common in the East End of London. Sarah Wedderburn, writing in the Church Times reported the incumbent of St Paul's saying 'the work succeeds because it captures so many different aspects of the culture of this community.' 'The Role of a Lifetime' provoked international publicity in magazines such as 'Flash Art Italia' and 'Untitled' and a copy of the film was subsequently purchased by Tate Galleries. 'The Role of a Lifetime' has since been exhibited internationally and featured at the 2009 Istanbul Biennial. Rose Finn-Kelcey's 'Angel' was a 2008 recipient of the ACE Award for 'Art in a Religious Context' It also featured as a best practice project in the Arts Council England Central London Partnership publication 'Open space'.Montague, Jemima Ed (February 2007) Open space: Art in the public realm in London 1995‚Äì2005, Arts Council England and Central London Partnership / 97807287 Catalogues were produced for 'Black Tent' Wade, Gavin Ed (2003) Nathan Coley: Black Tent, Art and Sacred Places and 'The Role of a Lifetime'Gleadowe, Teresa and Barratt, Paul Eds (2003) Deimantas Narkevicius: The Role of a Lifetime, Art and Sacred Places but 'Angel' has a website publication. In 2005 Art and Sacred Places embarked on 'Six Sacred Sites', its first interfaith project. This was a collaborative initiative working with 'aspex' gallery in Portsmouth and 'The Winchester Gallery' on the production and exhibition of site related artists' books. The project, which was designed to explore the range of ways in which a location may be regarded as sacred included communities and sites associated with Portsmouth Anglican Cathedral, Wessex Jamaat Mosque, Basingstoke Hindu Society, Newport Quaker Meeting, roadside shrines with RoadPeace and South Wonston's ancient long barrow. 'Six Sacred Sites' artists included Sam Winston, Jimmy Symonds and Ansuman Biswas. A copy of Census, the book produced by Glenn Boulter and Chris Maxted for the ancient long barrow, was purchased by Tate Galleries for their library. During one of the many exhibitions of the 'Six Sacred Sites' work the University of the West of England Bookarts co- organised with Winchester School of Art library an artist's book conference held at The Winchester Gallery. In 2009 Art and Sacred Places was retained by Bristol City Council Art and the Public Realm as the consultant curator for two permanent commissions for Roman Catholic Secondary Schools. The artists selected for the commissions were Elpida Hadzi-Vasileva and Michael Pinsky. Heather and Ivan Morison were commissioned by Art and Sacred Places to work in Manchester as a result of a 'Faiths in Action' award, also in 2009. Their interfaith work with Manchester Cathedral and Manchester Islamic Centre and Didsbury Mosque was continued by Nicola Dale. Dale's delicate entrance-exit ways, entitled 'Between' and exploring the notion of passage, became a physical link between the two places of worship. A catalogue was produced with articles by members of the communities and Dr Jacques Rangasamy MBE, a conversation between the artist and curator and poetry.Peagram, Angela Ed (2013) \\"Nicola Dale: Between\\", Art and Sacred Places Dale reminisces about this commission in.Rosen, Aaron (2015) \\"Religion and Art in the Heart of Modern Manhattan: St Peter's Church and the Louise Nevelson Chapel\\", Ashgate Press Art and Sacred Places has also curated and supported the work of 10 days in Winchester during three of its iterations. 'Companion of Space' was performed by emerging artists forma in response to the rhythm and symbolism of the ceremonies of Winchester Cathedral in 2011. 47 artists from all disciplines working on 30 projects carried out work for 'Creative Collisions' again in Winchester Cathedral in 2013. Included among the artists were Professor Alice Kettle and Stephen Cooper with their work 'The Offering'. In 2015 CHALK was the foundation, material and inspiration for work which ranged from the openly exquisite to the deeply reflective with 20 projects across both Winchester Cathedral and Winchester City Museum.

Vasu, starring R. K., Karthik, Sadha and newcomer Divya Vishwanath. Puli Vesham released on 26 August 2011 to moderate reviews. Plot Munian (R. K.) is the innocent-turned-underworld dada. The naive youngster from a remote village becomes a dreaded dada who could fix anyone and anything for money. He spends the money to treat a girl who is in coma for six months. Who is that girl and why does he spend money for her? The girl, Thamarai (Divya Padmini), is the daughter of a rich man (Ilavarasu) in Muniyan's native place. The rich man gives shelter to Muniyan at his earlier age after the death of his parents. Munian is given the responsibility of taking care of Thamarai. He takes the job very seriously and gets trained in martial arts just to protect her in any circumstance. A unique bond develops between them. Though it is not love, everyone suspects it to be love, and hence Munian is sent out of the village to save the girl. However, the girl doesn't want to get parted with him. She secretly follows him, and both of them get into an unexpected trouble in Chennai. The turn of events puts the girl in a hospital and makes Munian a gangster. Munian however, has some values and hence becomes an associate to an honest ACP P. Easwara Moorthy (Karthik), who wants to eliminate the rowdies with Munian's help. The officer sends Ashwini (Sadha) in the disguise of an orphan to Munian's gang just to keep him under check. Munian gets entangled with too many things before he could save his master's daughter. There are many players operating at different levels including the cricket crazy Govindan (Mansoor Ali Khan), who is involved in supplying girls to the rich, and Senthil (M. S. Bhaskar), a dreaded gangster. How he tackles everyone and achieves his goal forms the crux of the story. Cast * R. K. as Munian * Karthik as ACP P.

Top 10 cinema wrote:\\"Vasu has done some justifications to the script, which includes the film's climax standing out as the major highlight of the film. But if he had an engrossing screenplay and avoided certain clich√©s, the film would have been a trademark in the director's career\\". Kollytalk wrote:\\"P. Vasu has given some different twists to the usual 'innocent-turned-ruffian' storyline. He has managed to make the movie move fast with many twists and turns. Plenty of characters with different shades make the script interesting. However, too much of complications mars the effectiveness of the script.

While today the word is often used to indicate a member of the Camorra, a Mafia-type organisation in the region of Campania and its capital Naples in Italy, the guapperia (or guapparia; i.e., the guappo culture) predates the modern Camorra and was originally a different and separate criminal subculture that considered itself very much independent of the Camorra. Monica Florio, Il guappo Historically, \\"guappo\\" referred to a loosely cohesive 19th and early 20th century subculture that thrived in the Naples area and, to a lesser extent, nearby regions of Southern Italy. The subculture stereotypically consisted of a type of flashy, boisterous, swaggering, free-spirited, violent, dandy-like criminal, pimp, outlaw, and ruffian that nonetheless followed a chivalrous code of honor. Etymology A guappo in typical dress at the end of the 19th century. Drawing by Filippo Palizzi, 1866. Il sequestro Cirillo: un caso a lieto fine in odor di Camorra, Storia in Net \\"Il guappo\\" di Filippo Palizzi: quando un disegno vale pi√π di un libro di storia, Il Mediano, 29 August 2017 The word most likely derives from the Spanish guapo (Southern Italy had been under Spanish rule for centuries), meaning bold, elegant, or an ostentatious person, and which eventually derives from the Latin vappa, meaning flat wine or scoundrel. The noun guappar√≠a, which is sometimes also used to indicate the Camorra, means arrogance, domineering, or braggart. The verb guappia means to behave like a guappo (Camorrista), to be domineering and derives from the Spanish guapear (to feign courage, to flaunt elegance).Erwin & Bello, Modern Etymological Neapolitan- English Vocabulary The word also might be derived from the Gardu√±a, a fictitious criminal organisation in Spain said to be the precursor of the Camorra. The Gardu√±a was composed of guapos, generally good swordsmen, daring assassins, and committed bandits. Consiglio, La camorra a Napoli, p. 40 The word wop, a pejorative American ethnic slur for an Italian, probably derives from guappo.wop in wordorigins.org Characteristics Though the term today often refers to a member of the Camorra (i.e. a Camorrista), the historical figure of the ‚Äúguappo‚Äù is not necessarily synonymous with the Camorrista. It is a historical figure in the Neapolitan area, distinguishable by his smart or overdressed dandy-like appearance, his unusual pose that serves to draw attention to him, and the particular care he lavishes on his body and face. The guappo could be characterized as \\"simple\\" or \\"posh\\" according to the clothes he wore: the former preferred extravagant and flashy clothes while the latter loved to dress in clothes from the best tailors in Naples. Quando il guappo non era camorrista , Il Denaro Nr. 159, August 26, 2006 Originally, the guappo was rather a violent free spirit; free from the law as well as the \\"official\\" Camorra, with his proper code of honour, at once an extortionist, a rectifier of wrong for the local neighbourhood and a benefactor of artists of the caf√© chantant. He was sometimes allied with, and sometimes a rival of the Camorra. Around 1860, a guappo was described as an independent and individualist camorrista. Florio, Il guappo . Consiglio, La camorra a Napoli, p. 111 When the Camorra as an organisation was weak, the guappo flourished. After the first mass trial against the Camorra in 1911-12, and the advent of Fascist rule the Camorra as an organisation was nearly destroyed. The local guappo returned and the interwar period (1918‚Äì1939) was the heyday of the individualist guappo power. After World War II, with the return of the Camorra, the figure of the guappo eventually merged into the organisation. Di Fiore, Potere camorrista: quattro secoli di malanapoli, p. 10 and p. 128 A typical guappo of that era was Pasquale Simonetti, also known as \\"Pascalone ‚Äòe Nola\\", who controlled the Naples fruit market. He was married to Pupetta Maresca and famous for publicly slapping American Mafia boss, Lucky Luciano, at the Agnano racetrack. Pascalone e' Nola (In actual fact, the perpetrator was Francesco Pirozzi, known as Ciccillo 'o francese, one of the men of Camorra boss Alfredo Maisto.Allum, The Neapolitan Camorra, p. 146) In art and popular culture The Guappo is present in Neapolitan drama, music and literature, such as the Neapolitan song \\"Guapparia\\" by of the poet Libero Bovio, in works of the author Raffaele Viviani, and the journalists Ferdinando Russo and Matilde Serao. The famous comedian Tot√≤ played a role of an ordinary person bullied by a guappo in The Gold of Naples () a 1954 Italian comedy film directed by Vittorio De Sica. The Neapolitan composer of operas Domenico Cimarosa features a Guappo in his 1786 opera Il credulo. The transition from guapparia to Camorra in the mid-20th Century is portrayed in several filmic sceneggiate starring Italian actor and singer Mario Merola, who often played the role of an old-style \\"guappo\\" standing up against the injustices brought about by the Camorra; examples include Sgarro alla camorra (\\"Affront to the Camorra\\", 1973) and L'ultimo guappo (\\"The last guappo\\", 1978).

He left office after the 2015 elections, serving six years. McWaters is the founder and former CEO of Amerigroup, a managed health care organization launched out of Virginia Beach. Early life Jeff's father, Joe McWaters worked as a plant superintendent in a car radiator plant, and his mother Patsy McWaters worked as a school teacher and medical office manager. McWaters attended Paducah Tilghman High School and continued on to Paducah Community College before he enrolled at the University of Kentucky, where he pursued a degree in accounting. He joined the Kentucky Wildcats football team as a walk-on, but a knee injury prevented him from playing. Jeff met his wife Cindy when they both attended Paducah Tilghman High School. They married in 1981. Jeff and Cindy McWaters moved to Virginia Beach where he started Amerigroup, which would become one of the nations largest healthcare organizations, with revenues exceeding $6 billion (as of 2011). Jeff McWaters was inducted into the University of Kentucky's Gatton College of Business and Economics Hall of Fame in 2003.

Options Mental Health customized plans and programs for mental health and substance abuse recovery for National Employers, State Government, and Tricare = Amerigroup Corporation = Jeff McWaters started Americaid Community Care (Amerigroup) in 1994 in Virginia Beach. The company focused on meeting the healthcare needs of low-income families and individuals who relied on pre-existing state programs such as Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. Americaid Community Care focused on disease management programs for diseases and conditions such as prenatal care, asthma, diabetes, and sickle cell anemia. San Francisco-based venture capital firm, Acacia Venture Partners, lead the initial funding of the company, closely followed by co-investors Sutter Hill Ventures and New Enterprise Associates (NEA). The first operations of Americaid Community Care took place in New Jersey in 1996, quickly followed by Illinois and Texas. As Americaid Community Care launched a family of related products and gained a wider membership base, McWaters decided to give the company a more inclusive name, which resulted in the launch of Amerigroup Corporation in 1996.  Starting out  Amerigroup membership exceeded 100,000 in 1998. New Jersey membership increased as a result of Amerigroup's first acquisition; the Medicaid business from Oxford Health Plans. This was the first of about 14 future acquisitions Amerigroup would make. Following the purchase of Oxford Health Plan's Medicaid business, Amerigroup turned its first profit of about $3.5 million. In 1999, Amerigroup acquired Prudential HealthCare's Medicaid business, and in July of the same year opened an additional location in Dallas, where 34,000 members were added. Memberships reached 268,000 by the end of 1999, and the company more than doubled in size the following years.  Initial public offering and development of new programs  In 2000, Amerigroup launched a range of new programs, including Amerikids in Dallas and Houston, as well as Ameriplus in New Jersey. In the same year Amerigroup saw memberships increase across its programs, resulting in a total revenue of $646.4 million and a net income of $26 million. In the spring of 2000, Amerigroup filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with Deutsche Banc Alex Brown as lead underwriter. However, the stock market began to see declines and IPOs proved difficult to execute. In the summer of 2001, with Banc of America Securities and UBS Warburg as the new underwriters, a September date was set for the public offering to take place. Amerigroup's management was scheduled to be in New York's World Trade Center on September 10 and 11. However, by request from Bank of America, the IPO was moved to San Francisco for the morning of September 11, 2001. Following the September 11 attacks, Amerigroup discontinued the Public Offering, and stayed in registration for over a year. The IPO was complete on November 6, 2001, after submitting ten amendments since 2000. Amerigroup debuted on November 6, 2001, with 4.4 million shares of common stock (NASDAQ: AMGP) According to an article from Investor's Business Daily, \\"The shares were priced at $17, within the expected range of $17 to $19 Amerigroup jumped as high as $22.55 before closing up $3.90 at $20.90, a 23% gain.\\" Amerigroup netted $68.7 million from the IPO, most of which was earmarked for general corporate needs as well as further acquisitions. Amerigroup acquired MethodistCare Inc. in Houston, Texas, which resulted in another 18,000 members. By the end of 2001 the company had a membership base of 472,000, 150,000 of those memberships being brought on directly from acquisitions. At the year-end, premiums reached $889.5 million and net revenue had grown by 31% from the previous year. Amerigroup added another 6,000 members through the acquisition of the D.C Medicaid business of Capital Community Health. Continuing in the year of 2002, the company saw significant growth in various markets ‚Äì this included 7,000 new memberships in Maryland, 11,000 in New Jersey, 20,000 in Dallas, 23,000 in Fort Worth, and 39,000 in Houston. Amerigroup saw an overall growth with nearly 600,000 members, premiums exceeding 1 billion, and a net income of $47 million. In 2003, Amerigroup moved from NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) followed by a second offering of stock. Amerigroup continued to expand through the purchase of Physicians Healthcare Plans, adding an additional 190,000 members in Florida. As a result of the acquisitions, Amerigroup expanded into the Tampa, Orlando, and Miami/ Fort Lauderdale markets. Right before 2003 year-end, Amerigroup acquired St. Augustine Medicaid, resulting in an added membership base of 28,000. The company saw growth beyond the Florida market with 47,000 members acquired from its other markets. 2003 year-end results showed premiums topping $1.6 billion with a net income of $67.3 million. In 2004, Amerigroup entered the New York City market with plans to acquire CarePlus Health Plan. The $125 million purchase would open doors to about 1.3 million people eligible for Medicaid. Amerigroup reached a point of memberships beyond the million mark.  Lawsuits and Challenges  In July 2005, Amerigroup's annual revenue had grown to $1.8 billion with a stock price of $46.92 per share. In September 2005, Amerigroup missed the analysts' estimated earnings for the second quarter, meaning they would fall short in the third quarter and have to report a loss of $2.3 million as opposed to a profit of $24.7 million. The Medicaid managed-care market in Fort Worth, Texas had slowly diminished to Amerigroup and one other competitor. When the competitor's plan failed, Amerigroup took on its remaining members at the state's request. The patients in question needed more care than Amerigroup had expected, and the company had updated its computer processing systems which resulted in expenses hitting the books earlier than anticipated. On September 28, 2005, Amerigroup announced its loss, and by October 27, the company's stock price had dropped to $15.45 per share. The company performed better in the fourth quarter of 2005, but it took several months for Amerigroup to fully recover. In 2007, Amerigroup settled a lawsuit brought on by shareholders who claimed to have been defrauded following the company's drop in share price as a result of the money lost in the third quarter of 2005. Amerigroup paid $5 million in settlements. Amerigroup became subject to a second lawsuit lead by an ex-employee along with the state of Illinois and the Federal Government. The False Claims Act stated that Amerigroup had defrauded the government by discouraging women with advanced pregnancies as well as other high-cost patients from signing up for care under Amerigroup. However, Amerigroup argued that the state had previously agreed it was unwise for these patients to switch care provider. A federal jury ruled against the company, and Amerigroup settled the lawsuit in 2008 with $225 million.  The National Advisory Board and further expansion  Amerigroup formed the National Advisory Board (NAB) in 2007 which focused on healthcare services for seniors and people with disabilities. The board was made up of community advocates, national healthcare experts, and stakeholder groups. In 2007 Amerigroup entered the Tennessee market with programs intended to cover two different groups of low- income people. The twofold Medicaid programs were created to serve mothers and children through the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program and people with long-term illnesses and disabilities eligible for Medicaid's Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. The Tennessee subsidiary became the 10th state in which Amerigroup operated. The following fall, Amerigroup also acquired business in South Carolina, covering those eligible for certain Medicaid services.  McWaters retires as CEO  In August 2007, at age 51, Jeff McWaters retired as CEO of Amerigroup, but remained chairman of the board for one year. On July 9, 2007, a press release was published announcing the transition and change of upper management as founder and CEO Jeff McWaters retired from his role after 13 years. During a conference call conducted the same day, McWaters and his staff answered questions from analysts regarding the timing of his retirement as well as Amerigroup's future. McWaters responded with a recap of the company's achievements over the last 13 years, saying \\"The issue we set out to address at the state level in 1994‚Äîaccess, quality, and cost containment remain the central challenges facing our nation's overall healthcare system. The time is now for those of us in healthcare to take some lessons we've learned in Medicaid and apply them in a broad, more comprehensive way, ensuring access for all Americans.\\" In January of 2005, Forbes magazine placed Amerigroup on its list of America's Best Managed Companies. In 2010, Amerigroup broke into the Fortune 500 list, debuting at number 404. Amerigroup created over 4,600 jobs nationwide with 1,700 positions located in Virginia Beach. Amerigroup was recognized as one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune Magazine in 2011.  Sale of Amerigroup  In July 2012, WellPoint (now Anthem), a commercial health insurance company acquired Amerigroup for approximately $4.9 billion. Upon completion of the transaction, Amerigroup operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of Anthem.  Political career  = Overview = McWaters ran to replace outgoing Republican and sheriff-elect Ken Stolle in a special election held on January 13, 2010. He defeated city councilwoman Rosemary Wilson in the Republican primary, and Democrat Bill Fleming in the general election with 8,051 votes to Fleming's 2,184. He took office in 2010 with a focus on healthcare, military, education, and transportation in the Virginia Beach and Hampton Roads area. In 2004, McWaters served on the Presidential Healthcare Transition team for the Bush administration. During that time, he pushed for coverage of prescription drugs for seniors under Medicare. = 2011 Re- election = Senator McWaters was re-elected in November, 2011. His campaign focused on issues like ensuring in-state tuition eligibility for enlisted military who had applied for Virginia residency. McWaters served on several committees, including Commerce and Labor, Transportation, Education and Health, as well as the Privileges and Elections committee. Along with ten other legislative members, McWaters served alongside Governor McDonnell's transportation work group. = Retirement from the Virginia Senate = In February 2015, after six years in office, Senator McWaters announced he would not seek re-election the following November. McWaters did not rule out the possibility of seeking another elected post in the future.  Political Positions  Jobs and the Economy McWaters campaigns focused on local job creation[26] and is outspoken about his opposition to outsourcing. Healthcare Healthcare was a focus of McWaters 2010 campaign for senate,[26] during which he pushed for a competitive bidding process for Medicaid. Taxes and Spending McWaters believes in a smaller government and a robust private sector.[26] Transportation and education were also main focuses of McWaters 2010 campaign for senate.[26]  Trinity Church  In 2007, Jeff and Cindy McWaters helped found Trinity Church in Virginia Beach. Trinity Church operates five campuses; Virginia Beach Oceanfront, Princess Ann Road, Virginia Beach Town Center, Downtown Norfolk inside Nauticus and Stuttgart (Germany).

She was the favorite concubine of Emperor Yizong (Li Wen/Li Cui) and the mother of his favorite daughter, Princess Tongchang.  Background  It is not known when the future Consort Guo was born. When she was young, she entered the mansion of Li Wen, who was then the Prince of Yun, and became his concubine.As Li Wen was created the Prince of Yun in 846 and became emperor in 859, Consort Guo's becoming his concubine must be sometime during those years. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 19, part 1. At that time, Li Wen, who was the oldest son of then-reigning Emperor XuƒÅnzong, was not favored by Emperor XuƒÅnzong, and he lived with other more distantly-related imperial princes at the princely residences known as the 16 Mansions, while the other sons of Emperor XuƒÅnzong lived inside the palace.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 249. Emperor XuƒÅnzong also despised it when people raised the issue that he should create a Crown Prince. Li Wen thus was often fearful of his father's wrath. It was said that Consort Guo tended to him carefully and comforted him.New Book of Tang, vol. 77.  As imperial consort  Emperor XuƒÅnzong died in 859. Initially, three high-ranking eunuchs that Emperor XuƒÅnzong favored, Wang Guizhang (ÁéãÊ≠∏Èï∑), Ma Gongru (È¶¨ÂÖ¨ÂÑí), and Wang Jufang (ÁéãÂ±ÖÊñπ), were set to have Li Wen's younger brother, Emperor XuƒÅnzong's favorite son Li Zi (ÊùéÊªã) the Prince of Kui, declared emperor, but another eunuch who opposed them, Wang Zongshi (ÁéãÂÆóÂØ¶), arrested and executed them. Wang Zongshi issued an edict in Emperor XuƒÅnzong's name, creating Li Wen Crown Prince (and changing his name to Li Cui). The next day, Li Cui was declared emperor (as Emperor Yizong). Emperor Yizong created Consort Guo Shufei (Ê∑ëÂ¶É), the second highest rank for imperial consorts.New Book of Tang, vol. 76. Her daughter was created the Princess Tongchang, and became Emperor Yizong's favorite daughter. When Princess Tongchang married the official Wei Baoheng in 869, Emperor Yizong spent immense amounts of gold and silver, as well as many other treasures, as her dowry, and also gave her a mansion.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 251. Because of Wei's marriage with Princess Tongchang, he was allowed to enter the palace at will and often feasted with Consort Guo, leading to rumors that he was having an affair with Consort Guo. In 870, Princess Tongchang died. Emperor Yizong was so shocked by her death that he, in anger, killed more than 20 imperial physicians, who were not able to save her. He further imprisoned some 300 relatives of those physicians. When the chancellor Liu Zhan and the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, i.e., the region of the capital Chang'an) Wen Zhang (Ê∫´Áíã) tried to speak against these actions, both of them offended Emperor Yizong and were demoted; Wen committed suicide. Princess Tongchang was buried in a grand ceremony with much treasure, such that the servants of the Wei household were gathering up the ashes of the items burned at the funeral in order to screen out the gold and silver in the ashes. Even after the burial, Emperor Yizong and Consort Guo missed her greatly, and they commissioned the musician Li Keji (ÊùéÂèØÂèä) to write a musical piece known as the Sigh of a Hundred Years (Ê≠éÁôæÂπ¥Êõ≤). Several hundred dancers danced to the music. Immense amounts of jewelry from the imperial storage were used to dress the dancers up, and a large amount of silk was used to cover the ground that they danced on.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 252. In 872, when the deputy principal of the imperial university, Wei Yinyu (ÈüãÊÆ∑Ë£ï), submitted a petition accusing Consort Guo's brother, Guo Jingshu (ÈÉ≠Êï¨Ëø∞), who was then the administrator of the imperial armory, of various immoralities, Emperor Yizong was so incensed at the accusation that he arrested Wei and put him to death by caning, and further confiscated his household to be servants. Emperor Yizong also exiled many officials accused of being Wei's associates.  After Emperor Yizong's death  In 873, Emperor Yizong died, and Li Yan, his son by the deceased imperial consort, Consort Wang, became emperor (as Emperor Xizong). Subsequently, Wei Baoheng, who was a chancellor by that point, was accused of various improprieties. Wei was exiled and subsequently ordered to commit suicide. However, Consort Guo appeared to escape reprisals and remained in the palace. In 880, the Tang realm was in upheaval over various rebellions, when the strongest of those rebels, Huang Chao, captured Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xizong to flee.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. Consort Guo was unable to accompany Emperor Xizong in flight. It was said that after this, her whereabouts became unknown, and it was not known what happened to her.

The use of DVR allows for extracting accurate and reliable information about the state of industry processes from raw measurement data and produces a single consistent set of data representing the most likely process operation. Models, data and measurement errors Industrial processes, for example chemical or thermodynamic processes in chemical plants, refineries, oil or gas production sites, or power plants, are often represented by two fundamental means: # Models that express the general structure of the processes, # Data that reflects the state of the processes at a given point in time. Models can have different levels of detail, for example one can incorporate simple mass or compound conservation balances, or more advanced thermodynamic models including energy conservation laws. Mathematically the model can be expressed by a nonlinear system of equations F(y)=0\\\\, in the variables y=(y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n), which incorporates all the above-mentioned system constraints (for example the mass or heat balances around a unit). A variable could be the temperature or the pressure at a certain place in the plant. =Error types= File:Normal_no_bias.jpgNormally distributed measurements without bias. File:Normal_with_bias.jpgNormally distributed measurements with bias. Data originates typically from measurements taken at different places throughout the industrial site, for example temperature, pressure, volumetric flow rate measurements etc. To understand the basic principles of DVR, it is important to first recognize that plant measurements are never 100% correct, i.e. raw measurement y\\\\, is not a solution of the nonlinear system F(y)=0\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. When using measurements without correction to generate plant balances, it is common to have incoherencies. Measurement errors can be categorized into two basic types: # random errors due to intrinsic sensor accuracy and # systematic errors (or gross errors) due to sensor calibration or faulty data transmission. Random errors means that the measurement y\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is a random variable with mean y^*\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, where y^*\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the true value that is typically not known. A systematic error on the other hand is characterized by a measurement y\\\\,\\\\\\\\! which is a random variable with mean \\\\bar{y}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, which is not equal to the true value y^*\\\\,. For ease in deriving and implementing an optimal estimation solution, and based on arguments that errors are the sum of many factors (so that the Central limit theorem has some effect), data reconciliation assumes these errors are normally distributed. Other sources of errors when calculating plant balances include process faults such as leaks, unmodeled heat losses, incorrect physical properties or other physical parameters used in equations, and incorrect structure such as unmodeled bypass lines. Other errors include unmodeled plant dynamics such as holdup changes, and other instabilities in plant operations that violate steady state (algebraic) models. Additional dynamic errors arise when measurements and samples are not taken at the same time, especially lab analyses. The normal practice of using time averages for the data input partly reduces the dynamic problems. However, that does not completely resolve timing inconsistencies for infrequently-sampled data like lab analyses. This use of average values, like a moving average, acts as a low-pass filter, so high frequency noise is mostly eliminated. The result is that, in practice, data reconciliation is mainly making adjustments to correct systematic errors like biases. =Necessity of removing measurement errors= ISA-95 is the international standard for the integration of enterprise and control systems\\"ISA-95: the international standard for the integration of enterprise and control systems\\". isa-95.com. It asserts that: > Data reconciliation is a serious issue for enterprise-control integration. > The data have to be valid to be useful for the enterprise system. The data > must often be determined from physical measurements that have associated > error factors. This must usually be converted into exact values for the > enterprise system.

History DVR has become more and more important due to industrial processes that are becoming more and more complex. DVR started in the early 1960s with applications aiming at closing material balances in production processes where raw measurements were available for all variables.D.R. Kuehn, H. Davidson, Computer Control II. Mathematics of Control, Chem. Eng. Process 57: 44‚Äì47, 1961. At the same time the problem of gross error identification and elimination has been presented.V.

Dynamic DVR was formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem by Liebman et al. in 1992.M.J. Liebman, T.F. Edgar, L.S. Lasdon, Efficient Data Reconciliation and Estimation for Dynamic Processes Using Nonlinear Programming Techniques, Computers Chem. Eng. 16: 963‚Äì986, 1992. Data reconciliation Data reconciliation is a technique that targets at correcting measurement errors that are due to measurement noise, i.e. random errors. From a statistical point of view the main assumption is that no systematic errors exist in the set of measurements, since they may bias the reconciliation results and reduce the robustness of the reconciliation. Given n measurements y_i, data reconciliation can mathematically be expressed as an optimization problem of the following form: \\\\begin{align} \\\\min_{x,y^*} & \\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\left(\\\\frac{y_i^*-y_i}{\\\\sigma_i}\\\\right)^2  \\\\text{subject to } & F(x,y^*)=0  & y_\\\\min \\\\le y^*\\\\le y_\\\\max & x_\\\\min \\\\le x\\\\le x_\\\\max, \\\\end{align}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! where y_i^*\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the reconciled value of the i-th measurement (i=1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\,\\\\\\\\!), y_i\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the measured value of the i-th measurement (i=1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\,\\\\\\\\!), x_j\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the j-th unmeasured variable (j=1,\\\\ldots,m\\\\,\\\\\\\\!), and \\\\sigma_i\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the standard deviation of the i-th measurement (i=1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\,\\\\\\\\!), F(x,y^*)=0\\\\,\\\\\\\\! are the p\\\\,\\\\\\\\! process equality constraints and x_{\\\\min}, x_{\\\\max}, y_{\\\\min}, y_{\\\\max}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! are the bounds on the measured and unmeasured variables. The term \\\\left(\\\\frac{y_i^*-y_i}{\\\\sigma_i}\\\\right)^2\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is called the penalty of measurement i. The objective function is the sum of the penalties, which will be denoted in the following by f(y^*)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\left(\\\\frac{y_i^*-y_i}{\\\\sigma_i}\\\\right)^2. In other words, one wants to minimize the overall correction (measured in the least squares term) that is needed in order to satisfy the system constraints. Additionally, each least squares term is weighted by the standard deviation of the corresponding measurement. The standard deviation is related to the accuracy of the measurement. For example, at a 95% confidence level, the standard deviation is about half the accuracy. =Redundancy= File:sensor_red.jpgSensor redundancy arising from multiple sensors of the same quantity at the same time at the same place. File:topological_red.jpgTopological redundancy arising from model information, using the mass conservation constraint a=b+c\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, for example one can calculate c\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, when a\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and b\\\\,\\\\\\\\! are known. Data reconciliation relies strongly on the concept of redundancy to correct the measurements as little as possible in order to satisfy the process constraints. Here, redundancy is defined differently from redundancy in information theory. Instead, redundancy arises from combining sensor data with the model (algebraic constraints), sometimes more specifically called \\"spatial redundancy\\", \\"analytical redundancy\\", or \\"topological redundancy\\". Redundancy can be due to sensor redundancy, where sensors are duplicated in order to have more than one measurement of the same quantity. Redundancy also arises when a single variable can be estimated in several independent ways from separate sets of measurements at a given time or time averaging period, using the algebraic constraints. Redundancy is linked to the concept of observability. A variable (or system) is observable if the models and sensor measurements can be used to uniquely determine its value (system state). A sensor is redundant if its removal causes no loss of observability. Rigorous definitions of observability, calculability, and redundancy, along with criteria for determining it, were established by Stanley and Mah, Stanley G.M. and Mah, R.S.H., \\"Observability and Redundancy in Process Data Estimation, Chem. Engng. Sci. 36, 259 (1981) for these cases with set constraints such as algebraic equations and inequalities. Next, we illustrate some special cases: Topological redundancy is intimately linked with the degrees of freedom (dof\\\\,\\\\\\\\!) of a mathematical system,VDI-Gesellschaft Energie und Umwelt, \\"Guidelines - VDI 2048 Blatt 1 - Uncertainties of measurements at acceptance tests for energy conversion and power plants - Fundamentals\\", Association of German Engineers, 2000. i.e. the minimum number of pieces of information (i.e. measurements) that are required in order to calculate all of the system variables. For instance, in the example above the flow conservation requires that a=b+c\\\\,. One needs to know the value of two of the 3 variables in order to calculate the third one. The degrees of freedom for the model in that case is equal to 2. At least 2 measurements are needed to estimate all the variables, and 3 would be needed for redundancy. When speaking about topological redundancy we have to distinguish between measured and unmeasured variables. In the following let us denote by x\\\\,\\\\\\\\! the unmeasured variables and y\\\\,\\\\\\\\! the measured variables. Then the system of the process constraints becomes F(x,y)=0\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, which is a nonlinear system in y\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and x\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. If the system F(x,y)=0\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is calculable with the n\\\\, measurements given, then the level of topological redundancy is defined as red= n - dof\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, i.e. the number of additional measurements that are at hand on top of those measurements which are required in order to just calculate the system. Another way of viewing the level of redundancy is to use the definition of dof\\\\,, which is the difference between the number of variables (measured and unmeasured) and the number of equations. Then one gets :\\\\begin{align} red= n - dof = n-(n+m-p) = p-m, \\\\end{align} i.e. the redundancy is the difference between the number of equations p\\\\, and the number of unmeasured variables m\\\\,. The level of total redundancy is the sum of sensor redundancy and topological redundancy. We speak of positive redundancy if the system is calculable and the total redundancy is positive. One can see that the level of topological redundancy merely depends on the number of equations (the more equations the higher the redundancy) and the number of unmeasured variables (the more unmeasured variables, the lower the redundancy) and not on the number of measured variables. Simple counts of variables, equations, and measurements are inadequate for many systems, breaking down for several reasons: (a) Portions of a system might have redundancy, while others do not, and some portions might not even be possible to calculate, and (b) Nonlinearities can lead to different conclusions at different operating points. As an example, consider the following system with 4 streams and 2 units. Example of calculable and non-calculable systems File:calculable_system.jpgCalculable system, from d\\\\,\\\\\\\\! one can compute c\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, and knowing a\\\\,\\\\\\\\! yields b\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. File:uncalculable_system.jpgnon- calculable system, knowing c\\\\,\\\\\\\\! does not give information about a\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and b\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. We incorporate only flow conservation constraints and obtain a+b=c\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and c=d\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. It is possible that the system F(x,y)=0\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is not calculable, even though p-m\\\\ge 0\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. If we have measurements for c\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and d\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, but not for a\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and b\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, then the system cannot be calculated (knowing c\\\\,\\\\\\\\! does not give information about a\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and b\\\\,\\\\\\\\!). On the other hand, if a\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and c\\\\,\\\\\\\\! are known, but not b\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and d\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, then the system can be calculated. In 1981, observability and redundancy criteria were proven for these sorts of flow networks involving only mass and energy balance constraints.Stanley G.M., and Mah R.S.H., \\"Observability and Redundancy Classification in Process Networks\\", Chem. Engng. Sci. 36, 1941 (1981) After combining all the plant inputs and outputs into an \\"environment node\\", loss of observability corresponds to cycles of unmeasured streams. That is seen in the second case above, where streams a and b are in a cycle of unmeasured streams. Redundancy classification follows, by testing for a path of unmeasured streams, since that would lead to an unmeasured cycle if the measurement was removed. Measurements c and d are redundant in the second case above, even though part of the system is unobservable. =Benefits= Redundancy can be used as a source of information to cross-check and correct the measurements y\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and increase their accuracy and precision: on the one hand they reconciled Further, the data reconciliation problem presented above also includes unmeasured variables x\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Based on information redundancy, estimates for these unmeasured variables can be calculated along with their accuracies. In industrial processes these unmeasured variables that data reconciliation provides are referred to as soft sensors or virtual sensors, where hardware sensors are not installed. Data validation Data validation denotes all validation and verification actions before and after the reconciliation step. =Data filtering= Data filtering denotes the process of treating measured data such that the values become meaningful and lie within the range of expected values. Data filtering is necessary before the reconciliation process in order to increase robustness of the reconciliation step. There are several ways of data filtering, for example taking the average of several measured values over a well-defined time period. =Result validation= Result validation is the set of validation or verification actions taken after the reconciliation process and it takes into account measured and unmeasured variables as well as reconciled values. Result validation covers, but is not limited to, penalty analysis for determining the reliability of the reconciliation, or bound checks to ensure that the reconciled values lie in a certain range, e.g. the temperature has to be within some reasonable bounds. =Gross error detection= Result validation may include statistical tests to validate the reliability of the reconciled values, by checking whether gross errors exist in the set of measured values. These tests can be for example * the chi square test (global test) * the individual test. If no gross errors exist in the set of measured values, then each penalty term in the objective function is a random variable that is normally distributed with mean equal to 0 and variance equal to 1. By consequence, the objective function is a random variable which follows a chi- square distribution, since it is the sum of the square of normally distributed random variables. Comparing the value of the objective function f(y^*)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! with a given percentile P_{\\\\alpha}\\\\, of the probability density function of a chi-square distribution (e.g. the 95th percentile for a 95% confidence) gives an indication of whether a gross error exists: If f(y^*)\\\\le P_{95}, then no gross errors exist with 95% probability. The chi square test gives only a rough indication about the existence of gross errors, and it is easy to conduct: one only has to compare the value of the objective function with the critical value of the chi square distribution. The individual test compares each penalty term in the objective function with the critical values of the normal distribution. If the i-th penalty term is outside the 95% confidence interval of the normal distribution, then there is reason to believe that this measurement has a gross error. Advanced data validation and reconciliation Advanced data validation and reconciliation (DVR) is an integrated approach of combining data reconciliation and data validation techniques, which is characterized by * complex models incorporating besides mass balances also thermodynamics, momentum balances, equilibria constraints, hydrodynamics etc. * gross error remediation techniques to ensure meaningfulness of the reconciled values, * robust algorithms for solving the reconciliation problem. =Thermodynamic models= Simple models include mass balances only. When adding thermodynamic constraints such as energy balances to the model, its scope and the level of redundancy increases. Indeed, as we have seen above, the level of redundancy is defined as p-m, where p is the number of equations. Including energy balances means adding equations to the system, which results in a higher level of redundancy (provided that enough measurements are available, or equivalently, not too many variables are unmeasured). =Gross error remediation= The workflow of an advanced data validation and reconciliation process. Gross errors are measurement systematic errors that may bias the reconciliation results. Therefore, it is important to identify and eliminate these gross errors from the reconciliation process. After the reconciliation statistical tests can be applied that indicate whether or not a gross error does exist somewhere in the set of measurements. These techniques of gross error remediation are based on two concepts: * gross error elimination * gross error relaxation. Gross error elimination determines one measurement that is biased by a systematic error and discards this measurement from the data set. The determination of the measurement to be discarded is based on different kinds of penalty terms that express how much the measured values deviate from the reconciled values. Once the gross errors are detected they are discarded from the measurements and the reconciliation can be done without these faulty measurements that spoil the reconciliation process. If needed, the elimination is repeated until no gross error exists in the set of measurements. Gross error relaxation targets at relaxing the estimate for the uncertainty of suspicious measurements so that the reconciled value is in the 95% confidence interval. Relaxation typically finds application when it is not possible to determine which measurement around one unit is responsible for the gross error (equivalence of gross errors). Then measurement uncertainties of the measurements involved are increased. It is important to note that the remediation of gross errors reduces the quality of the reconciliation, either the redundancy decreases (elimination) or the uncertainty of the measured data increases (relaxation). Therefore, it can only be applied when the initial level of redundancy is high enough to ensure that the data reconciliation can still be done (see Section 2,). =Workflow= Advanced DVR solutions offer an integration of the techniques mentioned above: # data acquisition from data historian, data base or manual inputs # data validation and filtering of raw measurements # data reconciliation of filtered measurements # result verification #* range check #* gross error remediation (and go back to step 3) # result storage (raw measurements together with reconciled values) The result of an advanced DVR procedure is a coherent set of validated and reconciled process data. Applications DVR finds application mainly in industry sectors where either measurements are not accurate or even non-existing, like for example in the upstream sector where flow meters are difficult or expensive to position (see P. Delava, E. Mar√©chal, B. Vrielynck, B. Kalitventzeff (1999), Modelling of a Crude Oil Distillation Unit in Term of Data Reconciliation with ASTM or TBP Curves as Direct Input ‚Äì Application : Crude Oil Preheating Train, Proceedings of ESCAPE-9 conference, Budapest, May 31-June 2, 1999, supplementary volume, p. 17-20.); or where accurate data is of high importance, for example for security reasons in nuclear power plants (see M. Langenstein, J. Jansky, B. Laipple (2004), Finding Megawatts in nuclear power plants with process data validation, Proceedings of ICONE12, Arlington, USA, April 25‚Äì29, 2004.). Another field of application is performance and process monitoring (see Th. Amand, G. Heyen, B. Kalitventzeff, Plant Monitoring and Fault Detection: Synergy between Data Reconciliation and Principal Component Analysis, Comp. and Chem, Eng. 25, p. 501-507, 2001.) in oil refining or in the chemical industry. As DVR enables to calculate estimates even for unmeasured variables in a reliable way, the German Engineering Society (VDI Gesellschaft Energie und Umwelt) has accepted the technology of DVR as a means to replace expensive sensors in the nuclear power industry (see VDI norm 2048,).

Source: (accessed: > Monday April 5, 2010) Ho! The atiyoga of natural perfection! Dzogchen Ati! .The Great Perfection, in its unbiased inclusivity, actualizes the meaning of self-sprung awareness. As the lion overawes all other beasts with his roar, so the language of Great Perfection commands the gradual approaches; speaking a tongue of its own, it engenders its own ultimate meaning. The land of natural perfection is free of buddhas and sentient beings; the ground of natural perfection is free of good and bad; the path of natural perfection has no length; the fruition of natural perfection can neither be avoided nor attained; the body of natural perfection is neither existent nor nonexistent; the speech of natural perfection is neither sacred nor profane; and the mind of natural perfection has no substance nor attribute. The space of natural perfection cannot be consumed nor voided; the status of natural perfection is neither high nor low; the praxis of natural perfection is neither developed nor neglected; the potency of natural perfection is neither fulfilled nor frustrated; the display of natural perfection is neither manifest nor latent; the actuality of natural perfection is neither cultivated nor ignored; and the gnosis of natural perfection is neither visible nor invisible. The hidden awareness of natural perfection is everywhere, its parameters beyond indication, its actuality incommunicable; the sovereign view of natural perfection is the here-and-now, naturally present without speech or books, irrespective of conceptual clarity or dullness, but as spontaneous joyful creativity its reality is nothing at all. In the verse of homage, the first, second and third lines reveal the self-sprung natural essence while the fourth line shows familiarity with that unchanging space of reality. The fruition of natural perfection is distinguished from our ordinary disposition by nothing more than an indication about the existential ground (the starting point that is 'basic total presence' adduced in the first line of the vajra-homage). All experience, therefore, is revealed as perfect and complete in the gnosis of pure mind. There is no imperfection anywhere: Perfect in one, perfect in two, perfect in all, life is blissfully easy. Unity is perfect as unitary pure mind, duality is perfect as the mind's creation, and multiplicity is abundant completion. In the transmission of the perfection of unity lies the pure buddha-dynamic; the teaching on the perfection of duality reveals everything as perfect projection; and by virtue of the perfection of multiplicity everything turns whole and splendid. Abiding here, doing nothing, embodied as man or god, our dynamic is buddha-reality; here sentient beings are cared for, And without any exertion we live in ease. Why Buddha is considered as the greatest and the most skillful spiritual teacher of all beings in the entire universe??? It's because Buddha has immense compassion for all sentient being and has realized that he can only be able to benefit and provide eternal happiness and bring peace to all beings by awakening to wisdom of truth and compassion. He never created any religious or spiritual systems which has central authority or systematic way to control individuals for sake of his doctrinal purpose but rather he wanted to give each individual ultimate freedom to Enlightenment. Actually, the essence of his spiritual teaching is to realize nature of truth and cessation of suffering by dismantling all kinds of authoritarian system and conquer its authority by power of truth through meditation, concentration, awareness, analytical wisdom and compassion. In process, which will give an opportunity to every authentic individual practitioner to experience truth for himself to get enlightenment and have his own dominant power over all systems in every aspects of cyclic existence like Buddha himself. In this process of conquering all authoritarian systems such as culture, language, financial, religion, government, education, gender are external establishment and internal habituation such as desire, ignorance, delusion, hatred, greed and Maras are inner conceptual establishment. In order to conquer both form of authoritarian systems wisely and nonviolently or even to conquer both life and death itself through practice of meditation is way to get a perfect awakening to ultimate truth of Enlightenment for benefit of all sentient beings.

The Mon√©gasque Revolution of 1910 was a series of confrontations by the subjects of Monaco against their ruler, Prince Albert I. It led to the end of absolute monarchy with the promulgation of the Constitution of Monaco the following year. Popular demands The subjects had several grievances against the prince. There was severe unemployment as the country lacked farmlands or factories and the gaming establishment banned the hiring of the prince's subjects. Their national pride was hampered by a poor reputation as \\"the moral cesspool of Europe\\". In addition, the prince spent his money in France rather than at home. They demanded a constitution and a parliament with the threat of overthrowing the monarchy and establishing a republic should the prince fail to comply. Other demands included the termination of Camille Blanc and Roland Bonaparte's monopoly over the gaming establishment, the removal of French citizens from state offices, and the separation of the prince's finances from the state's. In early March 1910, a delegation made up of Suffren Peymond, Th√©odore Gastaud, Andr√© Marsan and Charles Bellando de Castro arrived to deliver an ultimatum to the prince. Later that month, the prince acquiesced to their demands. For the rest of the year, there were protests against French domination of Monaco's government and economy. The Prince's Palace was also stormed by an angry mob who looted the palace. The prince escaped with the help of the Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince, and stayed in France until the riots died down. Soldiers of the Compagnie did try to defend the palace but ultimately failed after the day-long riot. Constitution On 5 January 1911, a new constitution was promulgated. Nevertheless, Prince Albert I still wielded considerable power and suspended the constitution during World War I. After Prince Albert I's death in 1922, The New York Times published a 1921 interview with him on the process and his views on the need for the 1911 revolution.

He was eventually defeated by the Tang general Kang Chengxun, who was assisted by the Shatuo general Zhuye Chixin.  Background of the Xu Prefecture soldiers  It is not known when Pang Xun was born, and little is known about his background other than that he was from Xu Prefecture and that his father Pang Juzhi () was still alive at the time of his eventual rebellion. Xu Prefecture had a long-standing military tradition in the middle-to-late Tang Dynasty, and had long been the capital of Wuning Circuit (), which was created to control and cut off the communications between the then-rebellious Pinglu (Âπ≥Áõß, then- headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong) and Zhangyi (ÂΩ∞Áæ©, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan) Circuits. However, the soldiers from Xu Prefecture, particularly since the time of the military governor Wang Zhixing, had become arrogant and lax in discipline, such that there were frequent mutinies against military governors (Jiedushi) that the imperial government sent to govern Wuning. For the imperial government, the last straw apparently came in 862, when the soldiers of the Yindao (ÈäÄÂàÄ, \\"silver sword\\") corps mutinied and expelled the imperially-commissioned military governor Wen Zhang (). The imperial government commissioned the general Wang Shi as Wen's replacement. Wang, once he arrived at Xu Prefecture, had the soldiers that he brought from Zhongwu (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan) and Yicheng (Áæ©Êàê, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan) Circuits slaughter the Yindao soldiers, killing several thousands. Then-reigning Emperor Yizong then issued an edict rebuking the people of and disbanding Wuning Circuit. Xu Prefecture was put under the jurisdiction of Yanhai Circuit (ÂÖóÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong); of Wuning's other prefectures, Hao Prefecture (Êø†Â∑û, in modern Chuzhou, Anhui) was put under the jurisdiction of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu); and Su (ÂÆøÂ∑û, in modern Suzhou, Anhui) and Si (Ê≥óÂ∑û, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu) Prefectures were made into a new Susi Circuit, with its capital at Su Prefecture, but with a lesser status than before‚Äînot having a military governor, but only a governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 250. In 863, after a disturbance where bandits intruded into Xu Prefecture and killed a number of officials before the attack was repelled by the prefect Cao Qing (), the headquarters of Susi Circuit was moved back to Xu Prefecture, and thereafter it was known as Xusi Circuit, governing Xu, Hao, Su, and Si Prefectures, thus restoring the prior Wuning territory, but still under the lesser status of governance by a governor, rather than a military governor. In 864, with the southwestern parts of the Tang empire dealing with frequent Dali attacks, Emperor Yizong issued an edict recounting Xu Prefecture's military tradition and ordering the military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø, Tuanlianshi) to recruit 3,000 men from Xu Prefecture to be stationed at Yong Prefecture (ÈÇïÂ∑û, in modern Nanning, Guangxi) to guard against Dali attacks; the edict promised that once the troubles with Dali were over, the soldiers would be allowed to return home. Apparently, however, only 2,000 men were actually recruited, and of those, 800 were sent to Gui Prefecture (Ê°ÇÂ∑û, in modern Guilin, Guangxi), with a promise that they would be allowed to return home after three years. Pang was one of these men, and he served as an assistant to the commander, in charge of food supplies. At the end of the three years, the soldiers were hoping to return home, but the governor of Xusi, Cui Yanzeng (), under the advice of his officer Yin Kan (), decided to extend their stay at Gui Prefecture, because the expenses of recruiting new soldiers were considered too high. When this order reached Gui Prefecture, the Xu Prefecture soldiers were incensed.  Initial uprising and journey back to Xu Prefecture  At that time, the governor of Gui District (Ê°ÇÁÆ°, headquartered at Gui Prefecture), Li Cong (), had just left Gui District to take up his new position as governor of Hunan Circuit (ÊπñÂçó, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan), and the new governor of Gui had not arrived yet. The Xu Prefecture officers Xu Ji (), Zhao Keli (), Yao Zhou (), and Zhang Xingshi ()‚Äîall of whom had previously been bandits but who had submitted to the government after being given officer commissions‚Äîtook the opportunity to mutiny in fall 867. They killed their commander Wang Zhongfu () and supported Pang as their leader. The mutineers pillaged the armory, seizing weapons, and began their march home; as they went, they pillaged the territory, and the local governments were unable to resist. Emperor Yizong initially sent the high-level eunuch Zhang Jingsi () to Pang and issued a pardon for Pang and his soldiers, permitting them to return to Xu Prefecture; in response, the Xu soldiers stopped their pillaging. When they reached Hunan Circuit, they turned in their weapons and armor. They then went on ships and headed east on the Yangtze River. Meanwhile, Emperor Yizong also ordered Cui Yanzeng to not cause the mutineers to be alarmed, so Cui issued repeated mildly-worded orders to Pang's soldiers, trying to comfort them. In response, Pang also submitted respectfully-worded reports to Cui. While the Xu soldiers were en route down the Yangtze, however, they, particularly Xu Ji, considered their situation and concluded that their crimes were even greater than those of the Yindao‚Äîand that the only reasons why the imperial government issued a pardon were to prevent them from further pillaging or becoming bandits; they came to believe that they would be slaughtered upon return to Xu. They therefore used their wealth to equip themselves with armor and weapons. When they reached Huainan Circuit, the military governor of Huainan, Linghu Tao, provided them with food, even though Linghu's officer Li Xiang () pointed out that the Xu soldiers would eventually create further disturbances, as Linghu was only interested in preserving the peace for Huainan. Meanwhile, Pang recruited those Yindao soldiers who escaped the massacre and other bandits to add to the numbers of his soldiers. On October 22, Pang reached Si Prefecture. The prefect Du Tao () invited the soldiers to a feast and put on a play for entertainment. Before the start of the play, the leader of the actors, as was customary, was addressing the guests, when the Xu soldiers believed that he was parodying them, and they seized him and threatened to kill him. However, Du had prepared for this, and after this initial action, nothing else came of this. On October 23, Pang reached Xucheng (ÂæêÂüé, near Si Prefecture). Pang and Xu Ji announced to the soldiers that it was their belief that once they arrived in Xu, the soldiers would be slaughtered or at least exiled. They announced that their plan was to attack and seize Xu Prefecture and force the imperial government to allow them to keep it. The soldiers largely agreed, and Pang executed 12 people who did not; he sent messengers with the heads of the 12 to report to Cui that those 12 had encouraged a rebellion, and that he was presenting their heads as sign of submission. When Pang's messengers reached Cui, he arrested and interrogated them and found out the truth. Meanwhile, Pang submitted another petition demanding that Cui relieve Yin Kan, as well as two other key officers, Du Zhang (), and Xu Xingjian () of their duties, and further demanding that the returning soldiers be allowed to be stationed separately from the main corps. Cui gathered his officers and discussed how to react to this; most officers, by this point, realized Pang's intentions and advocated attacking Pang. As a result, Cui had the officer Yuan Mi () lead 3,000 men to attack Pang, and also ordered the Su and Si Prefectures to cut off Pang's paths as well. News that Yuan was heading toward them soon reached Pang's soldiers. They quickly attacked Su Prefecture and captured it on November 4. They then gathered all of the wealth in the city and announced publicly that anyone could come and take them. Thereafter, the people in the surrounding area all swarmed to Su Prefecture. Pang's soldiers then seized the strong young men among these people and forced them to join their corps, executing anyone who refused. Several thousands were quickly added to their numbers this way. When Yuan arrived on November 6 and attacked, he could not quickly capture Su Prefecture, but the mutineers were also fearful of Yuan. They thus released Zhang Jingsi and abandoned Su on the night of November 6, intending to flee on Bian River. The morning of November 7, Yuan, realizing that the mutineers had fled, gave chase, without giving his soldiers a chance to eat. When they reached the mutineers, the mutineers used the ships that they had as defense and further utilized the swamp landscape to their advantage, surprising Yuan. Yuan and most of his soldiers were killed, and the survivors surrendered to Pang. The survivors informed Pang that Xu Prefectures had virtually no defenses, and Pang thereafter resolved to attack Xu Prefecture. On November 8, Pang began a rapid march toward Xu Prefecture. Not until that night did Cui receive news that Yuan's army was annihilated, and he immediately sent urgent requests for reinforcements to the nearby circuits. On November 9, the Xu city gates were closed, and the circuit government rounded up the strong young men in the city to improve the defenses, but the city lacked the will to resist. Cui refused the calls for him to flee to Yanhai's capital Yan Prefecture (), pointing out that it was his responsibility to die in the city. On November 10, Pang's soldiers arrived at Xu and comforted the people in the surrounding area, such that they joined the mutineers in large numbers as well. Within an hour, the outer city fell to the mutineers. Soon thereafter, the inner city fell as well. The mutineers put Cui under arrest and executed Yin, Du Zhang, and Xu Xingjian. It was said that 10,000 men joined the mutineer army that day.  Resistance against imperial forces  Pang Xun took control of the circuit headquarters, took the title of acting military governor (ÁïôÂæå, Liuhou), and initially sought imperial commission to formally do so. He tried to get Cui Yanzhen's assistant, in Cui's role as the military prefect, Wen Tinghao (), to draft a petition for him requesting imperial commission, but after Wen refused, his strategist Zhou Chong () drafted a petition that was arrogantly worded, in which he threatened further military action against the imperial government if the imperial government did not commission him. Initially, though, the people in Xusi Circuit and the surrounding areas believed that the imperial government would be willing to commission Pang, and therefore, a large number of people in the surrounding origins, including agrarian rebels, went to Xu Prefecture and joined Xu's forces. Pang also sent his officer Liu Xingji () to Hao Prefecture; Li Yuan () to Si Prefecture; and Liang Pi () to Su Prefecture, to take control of those cities. Liu and Liang were able to do so, but Du Tao ambushed and resisted Li, and dug in on his defenses, ready to resist Pang. When the eunuch Kang Daowei () arrived to try to placate Pang and his army, Pang made a demonstration of the strength of his force, and submitted another petition through Kang. Meanwhile, though, he attacked a number of neighboring cities, capturing a number of counties. The imperial government, however, rejected Pang's overtures, as when the imperial edict arrived on December 2, all it declared were the faults of Cui and the eunuch monitor Zhang Daojin () and that they would be demoted. Pang, disappointed, arrested the eunuch delivering the edict. Meanwhile, Emperor Yizong commissioned the imperial guards general Kang Chengxun to be the military governor of Yicheng Circuit, to oversee the operations against Pang, while commissioning two other imperial guard generals, Wang Yanquan () and Dai Keshi (), to command two side armies to the north and south. At Kang's request, he was allowed to enlist the assistance of the Shatuo chieftain Zhuye Chixin, as well as those of the tribal chiefs of Tuyuhun, Tatar, and Qibi () tribes. Meanwhile, Pang's forces put Si Prefecture under siege, nearly capturing it. Even though Du Shenquan the military governor of Zhenhai Circuit (ÈéÆÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) and Linghu Tao both sent forces to try to lift Si's siege, both circuits' armies (commanded by Zhai Xingyue () and Li Xiang, respectively) were crushed and annihilated by Pang's forces. While Pang's forces were unable to capture Si Prefecture, they were able to capture a number of other prefectures around the region, including Chu (ÊªÅÊ¥≤, in modern Chuzhou) and He (ÂíåÂ∑û, in modern Chaohu, Anhui). Dai tried to recapture Duliang (ÈÉΩÊ¢Å, in modern Huai'an), where the rebels had crushed Huainan forces, before lifting Si Prefecture's siege. The rebels at Duliang feigned surrender, and then ambushed Dai. Dai's army was also crushed, and Dai was killed. LInghu, concerned that the rebels would attack Huainan next, sent messengers to Pang, offering to request imperial commission for him. Pang therefore suspended further advancements on Huainan, but continued to siege Si Prefecture. To the north, Wang was also repeatedly defeated by the rebels, and was replaced by Cao Xiang () the military governor of Taining Circuit (Ê≥∞ÂØß, i.e., the new name for Yanhai). He Quanhao the military governor of Weibo Circuit (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), which had been ruled semi-independently from the imperial government, also sent forces to aid Cao. By this point, except for their inability to capture Si Prefecture, Pang's forces were still essentially running into no opposition in their campaigns, but in spring 869, Kang began approaching Xu Prefecture with about 70,000 men, and he stationed himself near the rebel stronghold at Liuzi (Êü≥Â≠ê, in modern Suzhou). Pang, faced with this huge imperial army and the fact that his own soldiers were spread thin on various campaigns, began to be fearful, and by this point the people were no longer joining him in droves. Further, his army's attacks on Hai (Êµ∑Â∑û, in modern Lianyungang, Jiangsu) and Shou (Â£ΩÂ∑û, in modern Lu'an, Anhui) were repelled by forces loyal to the imperial government, at heavy losses. Meanwhile, Zhuye distinguished himself in battle, and when the rebel officer Wang Hongli (), who was instrumental in their victory at Duliang, attacked one of the imperial forces' camps at Lutang (ÈπøÂ°ò, in modern Shangqiu, Henan), Zhuye's Shatuo soldiers struck back, inflicting heavy losses on Wang. Kang's main forces then attacked Liuzi, and when Yao Zhou tried to relieve Liuzi, Kang defeated him, and when he fled to Su Prefecture, Liang killed him due to their prior personal conflict.  Declaration of independence  Hearing news of Liuzi's fall and Yao Zhou's death, Pang Xun, in fear, considered gathering all remaining troops for a decisive battle with Kang Chengxun. Zhou Chong suggested that, in order to make it clear the decisiveness of the confrontation, that he formally declare independence from the Tang regime. At the advice of Zhou and the sorcerer Cao Junzhang (), on May 19, 869, Pang executed Cui Yanzeng, Zhang Daojin, and a number of Cui's aides. He also cut off the limbs of Li Xiang and the Huainan eunuch monitor Guo Houben (), who was captured with Li Xiang, and delivered the limbs to Kang's camp to show resolve. Pang issued a declaration stating that while he did not originally want to rebel against the Tang emperor, he was doing so at this point. A further conscription drive of the men of Xu Prefecture was carried out, gathering some 30,000 men. Xu Ji and the others offered the titles of General Tiance () and \\"Brilliance Prince of the Congregation\\" () to Pang, although Pang only accepted the General Tiance title at that time. Pang, leaving Xu and his father Pang Juzhi in charge at Xu Prefecture, departed Xu Prefecture on May 23, first attacking the Weibo troops, which had been attacking the rebel- controlled Feng County, Jiangsu, catching Weibo forces by surprise. He crushed the Weibo forces, and Taining forces, hearing of Weibo forces' defeat, also withdrew. Pang gathered the food that the Weibo and Taining forces left, and then prepared for a major attack on Kang's main forces. He departed Feng on June 3, and called on the other rebel forces in the vicinity to join him for an attack on Kang at Liuzi on June 12. However, some Huainan soldiers whom he had captured escaped and informed Kang of Pang's plans. When the rebels from Xiangcheng (Ë•ÑÂüé, in modern Xuchang, Henan) arrived first, Kang defeated them, and when Pang subsequently arrived, Pang's own forces collapsed without an engagement, and Kang's forces subsequently routed them. Pang fled back to Xu Prefecture. Meanwhile, Ma Ju (), who had recently replaced Linghu Tao as the military governor of Huainan, attacked the rebels sieging Si Prefecture, crushing them and lifting the siege on Si. The rebels previously sieging Si Prefecture, under Wu Jiong (), withdrew to Hao Prefecture, and Ma put it under siege. Meanwhile, Kang advanced on Su Prefecture, which was then defended by the rebel officers Zhang Xuanren (), Zhang Ru (), and Zhang Shi (), and put it under siege. He could not capture it quickly, however, and Zhang Shi sent a petition to Pang, suggesting that Pang should make a surprise attack on Song (ÂÆãÂ∑û, in modern Shangqiu) and Bo (‰∫≥Â∑û, in modern Bozhou, Anhui) Prefectures, so that Kang would lift the siege on Su Prefecture. Kang, who had been concerned that Cao Xiang had since captured Feng County and was approaching Xu Prefecture, agreed.  Death  Unknown to Pang Xun, Zhang Xuanren had not joined him willingly, and soon, after persuading his direct subordinates to join him, made overtures to Kang Chengxun, offering to surrender Su Prefecture to Kang. On October 11, while Zhang Ru and Zhang Shi were drinking together, Zhang Xuanren had them surrounded, proclaimed that Pang had already died, and ordered that Zhang Ru and Zhang Shi be killed. The soldiers rushed in and killed Zhang Ru and Zhang Shi. Zhang Xuanren took over sole control of the city, and the next day opened the city gates and surrendered it to Kang. Kang immediately commissioned him as an imperial officer. Subsequently, under Zhang Xuanren's suggestion, Zhang Xuanren took 30,000 of his own soldiers, along with 500 imperial army soldiers, pretended to be leading a rebel army that was fleeing Su Prefecture after the imperial forces had captured it and headed for the rebel base at Fuli (), near Su Prefecture. When Fuli welcomed him, he killed the rebel commanders there and took it over, and then headed toward Xu Prefecture, preparing to use the same tactics to capture it. When he reached it, however, Pang Juzhi and Xu Ji had already received the news, and therefore put up defenses. On October 15, Zhang reached Xu Prefecture and surrounded it, but did not immediately attack it; rather, he announced to the defenders that the imperial government would not punish anyone who surrendered. The rebel soldiers began to surrender in droves. Pang Juzhi and Xu initially withdrew within into the inner city, but finding their own soldiers' morale failing, tried to fight out of the encirclement. Zhang intercepted and killed them. Several thousands of the rebels' family members were killed, and the imperial forces soon controlled the city. Meanwhile, Kang pursued Pang, who had made a surprise attack on Song Prefecture, capturing the southern city, but with Song's prefect Zheng Chuchong () defending the northern city, Pang abandoned further attempts to capture it and continued to head west, toward Bo Prefecture. By this point, though, the Shatuo forces under Zhuye Chixin had already arrived. Pang tried to head toward back to Xu Prefecture, but when he reached Qi County (ËòÑÁ∏£, in modern Suzhou), the local militia leader Zhang Gun () lifted the floating bridge to stop him from crossing the Huan River (). The imperial forces then attacked and killed a large number of rebel soldiers, with the rest throwing themselves into the river and largely drowning. Pang died in the battle as well. Wu Jiong, for some time, held out at Hao Prefecture, but Hao Prefecture fell after another month, ending the rebellion. In fiction Pang Xun is a character in the 1972 Hong Kong martial arts film Trilogy of Swordsmanship where he was portrayed by Lo Lieh.

The decision of which team would be selected to represent the division in the 2008 Big 12 Championship Game was controversial. Ultimately, the Oklahoma Sooners were chosen by their higher ranking in the polls, over the Texas Longhorns and Texas Tech Red Raiders. Games =Texas‚ÄìOklahoma= The game against the 2008 Oklahoma Sooners football team marked the 103rd meeting of the Red River Rivalry, which has been called one of the greatest sports rivalries. It is the longest running rivalry for the Longhorns. Since 1929 the game has been held at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, Texas typically in mid-October with the State Fair of Texas occurring adjacent to the stadium. Prior to 2008, Texas led the series 57‚Äì40‚Äì5. Texas won this meeting, 45‚Äì35. It was the highest scoring event in the history of the rivalry, and it was seen by the most fans ever to attend the Red River Rivalry‚Äîa record 92,182. =Texas‚ÄìTexas Tech= The series with the Texas Tech Red Raiders began in 1928 and the Longhorns' record through 2007 was 43‚Äì14‚Äì0. In the 2006 contest, #5 ranked Texas barely came away with a 35‚Äì31 win over an unranked Texas Tech team. In the 2007 game #14 Texas won 59‚Äì43. During his post-game press conference, Texas Tech's Mike Leach used most of his time to rail against the officiating crew for incompetence and bias. He speculated that the officials may have favored Texas because the head official lives in Austin, because they are incompetent, or possibly because the conference wants Texas to appear in a BCS bowl because of the increased appearance fees that such a bowl generates for the conference. Jim Vertuno of the Associated Press wrote \\"Leach was upset officials disallowed two Tech touchdowns in the third quarter. The first was overruled when video replay clearly showed the receiver let the ball hit the ground. On the next play, a touchdown pass was negated by a holding penalty. Leach also wanted, but didn't get, a flag for roughing the quarterback.\\" The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal reported, \\"Big 12 policy prohibits coaches from commenting publicly about game officials, so Leach‚Äôs actions leave him open to reprimand, fine or worse.\\" ESPN reported, \\"Leach's rant will likely draw a fine from the league and possibly a suspension.\\" The Big 12 fined Leach $10,000, the largest fine in conference history. The morning of the game, Las Vegas casinos favored Texas by 3¬Ω points. The weather forecast called for a temperature of and clear skies at kick-off. Students camped for a week to secure seating, and ESPN's College GameDay broadcast from Lubbock, Texas for the first time in the program's history. Students and fans rush the field after the #5 Red Raiders upset the #1 Longhorns Texas Tech won the coin toss and elected to receive the ball. The Longhorns forced a stop and the ensuing punt rolled inside the Texas 2-yard line. Offensive coordinator Greg Davis opted to line up in the I formation, an unusual formation for a team having trouble establishing a strong running game. The Texas running back was stopped in the end-zone for a two-point safety. Tech led the Horns for most of the game, by as much as nineteen points. Texas rallied to take a one-point lead with less than 1¬Ω minutes remaining in the game. On the Red Raiders drive, a Texas defensive back missed an interception that would have sealed a Texas victory, letting the ball slide through his hands. In the final minute, down 33‚Äì32 with one timeout remaining, Texas Tech QB Graham Harrell engineered a drive down the field by throwing for first downs which repeatedly stopped the clock in order to move the chains, and almost threw an interception that fell through the hands of Texas defensive back Blake Gideon that almost certainly would have ended the comeback attempt. Harrell's final play was a pass to wide receiver Michael Crabtree who caught the ball near the sideline and somehow miraculously broke away from two Longhorn defenders to scamper in for the winning score with one second left to play. The extra point gave the Red Raiders a 39‚Äì33 lead with one second remaining. The Tech fans had rushed the field after the touchdown, and again after the extra point. Tech was penalized accordingly and had to kick off from the 7¬Ω-yard line. Texas took the squib kick and lateraled twice in an attempt to score on the kickoff, but Tech caught one of the laterals to end the game. Subsequent to the loss, Texas fell from #1 to #4 in the BCS Poll, and Texas Tech rose to #2, behind Alabama. =Oklahoma‚ÄìTexas Tech= Texas Tech and Oklahoma first played in 1992. Coming into the game, the Sooners led the series 11‚Äì4‚Äì0 though the Red Raiders had won 2 of the last 3 with the last loss coming in Norman in 2006. The only road game Tech had won in the series was during the inaugural season of the Big 12 in 1996. Under head coach Bob Stoops, the Sooners had lost only two games at home. The Sooners were 7-point favorites. The Red Raiders opened the game with a kickoff return to their 32-yard line. The Sooners forced a punt, and fielded their offense at their 27. The Sooners scored a touchdown with 8:59 left in the first. DeMarco Murray contributed 48 rushing yards in the drive. Tech returned the ensuing kickoff to their 22, and a Sooner personal foul after the return gave the Red Raiders 15 yards. Texas Tech lost 10 of those yards due to a delay of game and a false start. Starting at their 27, the Red Raiders were stopped at the Oklahoma 48, where they punted again. The Sooners got the ball on their 20. On the second play of the drive, Oklahoma was punished again with a 15-yard penalty. After three failed attempts to pass the ball for a first down, the Sooners elected to make their first punt. On the next Tech possession, Graham Harrell was sacked on two consecutive plays, once by Adrian Taylor and the other by Gerald McCoy. Coming into the game, the Red Raiders ranked second in the nation in sacks allowed, with only 5. The Sooners ended the first quarter with a 42-yard reception by tight end Jermaine Gresham and two rushes by Chris Brown for a combined 12 yards. Once the second quarter commenced, both Brown and Gresham moved the ball for a touchdown on three different plays. Tech started their next drive at their own 38 and advanced the ball through the air to eventually get to the Oklahoma 15. Two incompletions caused the Red Raiders to face a 4th-and-3. Tech decided to go for it. Woods was unable to catch a pass by Harrell to convert and Tech turned the ball over on downs. Murray rushed the ball for 23 yards on Oklahoma's first play of the drive. Murray followed with a 31-yard reception, which put the ball on the Tech 30. After two rushes by Brown, Gresham scored a touchdown on a 19-yard catch, and the subsequent extra point extended the Sooners lead to 21‚Äì0. Oklahoma's defense forced Tech to four plays on the next drive, with the fourth play being a 4th-and-4, Tech's second 4th down conversion attempt. With 9:31 remaining, Oklahoma completed a 1:44 scoring drive, which was capped by Juaquin Iglesias' 28-yard scoring reception. On the following possession, the Red Raiders reached the end zone, thanks to Harrell's 25-yard throw to Tramain Swindall. Matt Williams' extra point brought the score to 28‚Äì7. With 6:28 left in the half, Oklahoma began to drain the clock using their running game. The Sooners eventually scored on the 12th play of the drive. Once Tech got the ball, about a minute was left on the clock. On the second play, Harrell threw an interception to Travis Lewis, who returned the ball 47 yards. Tech offensive guard Brandon Carter, who stopped Lewis at the Tech 1, received a personal foul. Murray scored on a 1-yard rush to increase the Sooners' lead to 42‚Äì7. Tech got the ball again after the Sooner touchdown with 18 seconds remaining in the game. Harrell threw a shovel pass to Baron Batch, who ran 21 yards to the Tech 28. The half ended with Tech receiving a 16-yard personal foul. The Red Raiders left the field facing their biggest deficit of the season (35 points). Tech attempted an onside kick to start off the second half, though the Sooners grabbed the ball at the Tech 34. OU ended the drive on a 33-yard field goal. Tech fumbled on their next possession, Oklahoma's Keenan Clayton recovered the fumble and return it 53 yards to the Tech 3. The Sooners added another 7 points to extend their lead to 52‚Äì7. Tech cranked up its passing game on its next possession, eventually scoring a touchdown and extra point with 5:39 remaining in the third quarter. On the subsequent drive, the Red Raider defense forced their first sack on Bradford, and also forced the Sooners to punt. The Sooner defense countered in the next drive by forcing a three-and-out. The Sooner offense then added another score on a 66-yard reception by Manuel Johnson. The Tech defense blocked the extra point, and the score remained at 58‚Äì14. In the fourth quarter, Tech failed to convert another fourth down, producing another turnover. Oklahoma scored immediately afterwards, improving their lead to 65‚Äì14. On the next possession, Tech was able to make three pass completions of at least 12 yards, though on the final play of the drive, Harrell lost the ball to the Sooners on a sack. With 10:50 left in the game, the Sooners started to run out the clock. The Red Raiders stopped them from scoring on a 4th down from the 1. Tech got the ball back with 4:48 on the clock. After a few plays, Tech faced another 4th down, and this time was able to convert it with a 13-yard throw to Crabtree. Tech later score their third touchdown with 11 seconds left, and Williams tacked on the extra point to change the score to 65‚Äì21. Tech attempted an onside kick and recovered the ball. The final play was a short-yard catch by Woods. Since the Sooners won, Tech, Texas, and OU all tied for first in the division at 6‚Äì1. If all three teams win their regular season finales to tie again at 7‚Äì1, the highest ranked team in the BCS standings will earn a spot in the Big 12 Championship game. Sports columnists have also stated that the quarterback of the winning team would be the front runner for the Heisman Trophy. Controversy Oklahoma, Texas, and Texas Tech all finished the season with identical 7‚Äì1 conference records, creating a three-way tie for the South division championship. Under Big 12 tiebreaker rules, ties are normally broken by head-to-head matchups but this case was unique as Texas beat Oklahoma 45‚Äì35, Oklahoma beat Texas Tech 65‚Äì21, and Texas Tech beat Texas 39‚Äì33 which made breaking the three-way tie impossible using head-to-head games. Because the first four tie-breakers did not dictate a winner, Big 12 rules dictate that the fifth tie-breaker is the team with the highest BCS Ranking, based on the standings released on November 30 of that year, would represent the South Division. This rule meant that coaches, journalists, and computer rankings effectively determined the Big 12 South division representative, because they are the major components of the BCS ranking formula. Texas Tech, Texas, and Oklahoma were all presented Big 12 South Champion trophies from the Big 12. During the final week of the Big 12 regular season, Oklahoma defeated a tough Oklahoma State and Texas defeated a much softer Texas A&M; delivering a sufficiently higher computer rating to Oklahoma.http://collegesportsblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2008/12/big-12-commissioner- says-its-been-a-toug.html http://www.star- telegram.com/college_sports/story/1065666.html References Category:College football controversies Category:Oklahoma Sooners football Category:Texas Longhorns football Category:Texas Tech Red Raiders football Big 12 Conference South Division Big 12 Conference South Big 12 Conference South ","title":"2008 Big 12 Conference South Division 3-way tie controversy"},{"id":"26684166","text":"The Lion Cubs, also known as Ashbal, are child soldiers in the Middle East.

Brookings institute Iraq has also organized several child soldier units. Some of these units fall under the rubric of the Futuwah (Youth Vanguard) movement, a Ba‚Äôath party organ formed in the late 1970s and aimed at establishing a paramilitary organization among children at secondary school level. In this regime-run program, children as young as 12 are organized into units and receive military training and political indoctrination. Units of this force were even pressed into service during the nadir of Iraqi fortunes in the war against Iran (in the mid-1980s). The most important Iraqi child soldier units, though, are the Ashbal Saddam (Saddam Lion Cubs). This is a more recent organization, formed after the defeat in the 1991 Gulf War, when the regime‚Äôs hold on power faltered. The Ashbal Saddam involve boys between the ages of 10 and 15, who attend military training camps and learn the use of small arms and infantry tactics. The camps involve as much as 14 hours per day of military training and political indoctrination. They also employ training techniques intended to desensitize the youth to violence, including frequent beatings and deliberate cruelty to animals.

Children are used as human shields on the front lines and to provide blood transfusions for Islamic State soldiers, according to Shelly Whitman of the Rom√©o Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative. The second installment of a Vice News documentary about ISIL focused on how the group is specifically grooming children for the future. A spokesman told VICE News that those under the age of 15 go to sharia camp to learn about religion, while those older than 16 can go to military training camp. Children are also used for propaganda. According to a UN report, \\"In mid-August, ISIL entered a cancer hospital in Mosul, forced at least two sick children to hold the ISIL flag and posted the pictures on the internet.\\" Misty Buswell, a Save the Children representative working with refugees in Jordan, said, \\"It's not an exaggeration to say we could lose a whole generation of children to trauma.\\" On November 2014, the ISIS released a propaganda video showing children from Kazakhstan being trained with firearms. The video showed the steps of the boys‚Äô training and emphasized the ‚Äúholy-warrior‚Äù image of ISIS by showing the boys recite the verses from the Quran and declaring war against the ‚Äúunbelievers.‚Äù‚Äî\\"I will be the one who slaughters you, O kuffar (non-believer).

The brand has been owned by Randa Accessories since 1998.  History  Lucilla Mara de Vescovi was born in Rome, Italy in 1893. Daughter of a very wealthy medicine professor of the University of Rome, descendant of an ancient noble family from the Veneto, and, from her mother‚Äôs side, from baroness De Gleria from Trieste, descendant of baroness Maria Hatvany from Hungary. His brother Silvio, medical doctor and mining engineer, survived the sinking of the Lusitania and took care of the family‚Äôs business interests in mining in Chile. She married Malcolm Whitman, an American singles tennis champion, in 1926. In 1930, following an argument about her husband's dull ties, his wife made him one from silk dress material. Following Whitman's suicide in 1932, his widow travelled through Europe, purchasing fabrics that she brought back to New York with the intention of launching a career making men's ties. Vescovi Whitman founded Countess Mara, her men's neckwear company, in 1935. While Mara was her second name, the company name might have been inspired by an 18th-century Kneller portrait of the Countess de Mar wearing a loosely tied Steinkirk cravat. Countess Mara ties featured several novel marketing decisions. Vescovi Whitman had the C.M. initials featured on the outside blade of each tie, ensuring that they were instantly recognizable. The ties were made in very limited quantities, typically only fifteen dozen per design, and they were comparatively expensive. This led to their becoming collector's items, sought after by celebrities and fashion-conscious businessmen. As a designer, Vescovi Whitman aimed to make her ties colourful, interesting and artistic, while avoiding spectacular and showy designs. She described her ties as \\"jungles\\" populated with trees, flowers and animals. However, her ties also featured a wide range of other subjects, including astrological signs, Egyptian hieroglyphs, the Devil, Lady Godiva, torn love-letters and safety pins. Other tie manufacturers, noticing her success, copied her business model and hired artists to imitate her tie designs. Vescovi Whitman did not mind this, saying in 1949 that being imitated had \\"expanded the acceptablity of the pictorial tie\\". In 1944 Countess Mara was awarded the Neiman Marcus Fashion Award in recognition of the influence its ties had had upon fashion. Among their most high-profile wearers were Frank Sinatra, Eugene O'Neill and J. Edgar Hoover.  Countess Mara Today  The Countess Mara brand was purchased in March 1998 by Randa Accessories, a major manufacturer and distributor of men's neckwear.NY Times, March 1998 Countess Mara belts, leather goods, neckwear, shirts, sportswear, and other products and accessories are retailed worldwide.

Ethnic cleansing is widely regarded as a fourth mass atrocity crime by legal scholars and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in the field, despite not yet being recognized as an independent crime under international law.Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, Background Briefing: Defining the Four Mass Atrocity Crimes, Publications (Aug. 15, 2018), http://www.globalr2p.org/publications/688; Global Action against Mass Atrocity Crimes, Prevention of Atrocities, About GAAMAC, https://www.gaamac.org/web-pages/view/16 Crimes of aggression are considered by some to be mass atrocity crimes and they are included in the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. However, most legal scholars do not consider them to be mass atrocity crimes.See, generally, Press Release, International Criminal Court, Assembly activates Court‚Äôs jurisdiction over crime of aggression (Dec. 15, 2017), available at https://www.icc- cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1350. While it is certainly a grave violation of international law and frequently the context in which mass atrocity crimes are committed, the crime of aggression is distinguishable because it is an attack on the territory, sovereignty, or political independence of a state rather than on individuals.See, Coalition for the International Criminal Court, The Crime of Aggression, ICC Crimes (2018), http://www.coalitionfortheicc.org/explore/icc-crimes/crime-aggression. The primary international laws defining mass atrocity crimes are the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their 1977 Additional Protocols, and the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The jurisprudence of the International Criminal Court, ad hoc international criminal tribunals, and the International Court of Justice further define and enforce these laws.  Crimes Against Humanity The term \\"crimes against humanity\\" has been applied to a wide range of acts and is often seen as broader than the other three mass atrocity crimes. While crimes against humanity can include many acts that also constitute war crimes, genocide, or ethnic cleansing, it bears distinguishing characteristics. Unlike war crimes, crimes against humanity may be committed in times of war or peace and can only be committed against civilian populations.Trial International, What are Crimes Against Humanity?, What We Do, https://trialinternational.org/topics-post/crimes-against-humanity/. Unlike genocide, the acts need not be targeted against a specific group. Crimes against humanity have not been codified under a dedicated international treaty. The International Law Commission recently submitted a draft convention to the United Nations General Assembly that would include provisions prohibiting, punishing, and defining crimes against humanity.Int‚Äôl Law Comm‚Äôn, Crimes against humanity: Texts and titles of the draft preamble, the draft articles and the draft annex provisionally adopted by the Drafting Committee on second reading, 71st Sess., Apr. 29-June 7, July 8- Aug. 9, 2019, U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/L.935 (May 15, 2019).G.A. Res. 73/265 ¬∂ 43, U.N. Doc. A/RES/73/265; MADRE, The International Crimes Against Humanity Treaty: A Call to Action for Advocates (2019), https://www.madre.org/international-crimes-against-humanity- treaty. Despite not being the subject of a dedicated treaty, the prohibition against crimes against humanity is considered customary international law and an established norm, meaning it is binding on all states without exception.United Nations Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect, Crimes Against Humanity, Definitions, https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/crimes-against-humanity.shtml. The term has a long history of use both in political and legal contexts. Crimes against humanity, and similar terms, were used in the 18th century and early 19th century to describe slavery and atrocities committed as part of colonialism. Its first formal use in international law was a 1915 declaration condemning the massacre of Armenians by the Turkish government.International Crimes Database, Crimes Against Humanity, Crimes (2013), http://www.internationalcrimesdatabase.org/Crimes/CrimesAgainstHumanity. Since then the term has been used and defined in similar, but variant ways by the Nurmeberg Tribunal, Tokyo Tribunal, International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and International Criminal Court. The Rome Statute reflects the latest consensus of the international community on the definition of crimes against humanity. The statute did not limit the definition to acts occurring in times of armed conflict, included a wider range of sexual violence as prohibited acts, and expanded the grounds on which persecution can be committed.[1] Louise Chappell, The Politics of Gender Justice at the International Criminal Court: Legacies and Legitimacy, 27 Eur. J. Int‚Äôl L. 1176 (2017); Brook Sari Moshan, Women, War, and Words: The Gender Component in the Permanent International Criminal Court‚Äôs Definition of Crimes Against Humanity, 22 Fordham Int‚Äôl L. J. 154 (1998). The statute defines crimes against humanity as any of the following acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack: :(a) Murder. :(b) Extermination; :(c) Enslavement; :(d) Deportation or forcible transfer of population; :(e) Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law; :(f) Torture; :(g) Rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity; :(h) Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender...or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law, in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court; :(i) Enforced disappearance of persons; :(j) The crime of apartheid; :(k) Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.  Genocide  At its most essential, \\"genocide\\" is acts committed with the intent to destroy a particular group.Raphael Lemkin, Axis Rule in Europe: Laws of Occupation, Analysis of Government ‚Äì Proposals for Redress, p. 80, New York, NY: Howard Fertig, 1973. This destruction may be achieved by both fatal and non-fatal acts, ranging from slavery to rape and from mass killings to forced sterilizations.Sareta Ashraph, Beyond Killing: Gender, Genocide, & Obligations Under International Law 3 (Global Justice Center 2018), available at http://globaljusticecenter.net/blog/20-publications/briefs-and-white- papers/1009-beyond-killing-gender-genocide-and-obligations-under- international-law. Like crimes against humanity, genocide can occur in times of peace or war.Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide art. 1, Dec. 9, 1948, 78 U.N.T.S. 277. Genocide is characterized, in large part, by its specific intent requirement.Int‚Äôl Law Comm‚Äôn, Draft Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind with commentaries, 48th Sess. p. 44 (1996), available at http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/7_4_1996.pdf. While many of the constitutive acts of genocide are captured by the other atrocity crimes, and in fact were tried under crimes against humanity in the Nuremberg trials,Agreement for the Prosecution and Punishment of the Major War Criminals of the European Axis, and Charter of the International Military Tribunal, Aug. 8, 1945, art. 6(c). modern conceptions note that the targeting of a protected group for destruction is unique to genocide.See, generally, Int‚Äôl Law Comm‚Äôn, Draft Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind with commentaries, 48th Sess. p. 44 (1996), available at http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/7_4_1996.pdf Like crimes against humanity, the prohibition of genocide is customary international law and an established norm, meaning it is binding on all states without exception. In addition, it has been codified and included in the jurisdiction of several international adjudicatory bodies, including the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia,Updated Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugolsavia, S.C. Res. 827, U.N. Doc. S/RES/827, art. 4 (May 25, 1993) (as amended July 7, 2009). International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda,Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, S.C. Res. 995, U.N. Doc. S/RES/955, art. 2 (Nov. 8, 1994) (as amended Oct 13, 2006). and the International Criminal Court.Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court, art. 6, July 17, 1998, 2187 U.N.T.S. 3.. In 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide (also known as the Genocide Convention), a dedicated treaty establishing multilateral obligations to act in the face of genocide.Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Dec. 9, 1948, 78 U.N.T.S. 277. Article II of the Genocide Convention defines genocide as \\"...any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\\": :(a) Killing members of the group; :(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; :(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; :(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; :(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.  War Crimes  War crimes are serious violations of the laws and customs governing international armed conflict.International Committee of the Red Cross, Rule 156. Definition of War Crimes, Customary IHL, https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule156. The definition has evolved over time to include actions that occur not just in war between states, but also internal armed conflicts.Gu√©na√©l Mettraux, International Crimes and the Ad Hoc Tribunals (Oxford University Press 2005). War crimes run parallel to international humanitarian law ‚Äî both contained primarily in the Geneva Conventions. International humanitarian law encompasses a wide range of treatment that different categories of protected persons are entitled to, such as non-discriminatory medical care for the wounded and sickAkila Radhakrishnan, Elena Sarver, & Grant Shubin, Protecting safe abortion in humanitarian settings: overcoming legal and policy barriers, 25 Reproductive Health Matters 40 (2017), available at http://www.globaljusticecenter.net/publications/articles/861-iprotecting-safe- abortion-in-humanitarian-settings-overcoming-legal-and-policy-barriers. or minimum conditions of detention for prisoners of war.International Committee of the Red Cross, Prisoners of War and Detainees Protected under International Humanitarian Law, Protected Persons (Oct. 29, 2010), https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/war-and-law/protected-persons/prisoners- war/overview-detainees-protected-persons.htm Conversely, acts that rise to the level of war crimes are those with a particularly grave effect on persons, objects, and important values that give rise to criminal responsibility. Customs governing armed conflict date back centuries, but the development and codification of the modern concept of war crimes began in the late 19th century with the drafting of The Hague Conventions defining restrictions on methods of warfare.United Nations Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect, War Crimes, Definitions, https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/war-crimes.shtml. The Geneva Conventions that emerged after World War II, as well as the Additional Protocols, provide the most robust framing of the laws of armed conflict. In addition, the definition and interpretation of war crimes were developed by the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and the International Criminal Court. Like crimes against humanity and genocide, it is also customary international law. While no one document codifies all war crimes, the Rome Statute is the most recent consensus. It defines war crimes as \\"grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions\\" and lists \\"any of the following acts against persons or property protected under the provisions of the relevant Geneva Convention\\" # Willful killing, or causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health # Torture or inhumane treatment # Unlawful wanton destruction or appropriation of property # Forcing a prisoner of war to serve in the forces of a hostile power # Depriving a prisoner of war of a fair trial # Unlawful deportation, confinement or population transfertransfer # Taking hostages The United Nations Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes recognizes that the 1949 Geneva Conference protects four groups of people in armed conflict: # The wounded and sick in armed forces in the field # The wounded, sick, and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea # Prisoners of war # Civilian persons The 1977 Additional Protocols of the Geneva Conventions added more protected groups, including women, children, civilian medical personnel, and journalists.  Ethnic Cleansing  The term \\"ethnic cleansing\\" encompasses a broad range of unlawful actions with the intent of removing a group from a specific area. This may be done through non-violent acts, such as administrative regulations on movement and preventing access to medical care, education, or humanitarian aid.Drazen Petrovic, Ethnic Cleansing - An Attempt at Methodology, 5 EJIL 342, 345 (1994). It can also be carried out through harassment and threats. Finally, ethnic cleansing can be carried out through violent measures including rape, torture, forced deportation, mass incarceration, killings, and attacks on political and cultural figures and sites. Much like other mass atrocity crimes, there is significant overlap between ethnic cleansing and the previously mentioned acts. It can be tried as a crime against humanity or, specifically during armed conflict, a war crime.George J. Andreopoulos, Ethnic cleansing, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (Feb. 12, 2004), https://www.britannica.com/topic/ethnic-cleansing. Its relationship with genocide is particularly complicated due to the overlap in the intent to target a particular \\"national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\\"See, e.g., William A. Schabas, Genocide and the International Court of Justice: Finally, a Duty to Prevent the Crime of Crimes, 2(2) Genocide Studies and Prevention: An International Journal 101, 109 (2007). Ethnic cleansing is often discussed in tandem with genocide. For example, the International Court of Justice determined that most of the acts committed in Bosnia by Serb forces were \\"ethnic cleansing,\\" but fell short of genocide.Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosn. & Herz. v. Serb. & Montenegro), Judgment, 2007 I.C.J. Reports 43, ¬∂ 190 (Feb. 26). What distinguishes ethnic cleansing from genocide is intent. The purpose that drives ethnic cleansing is to render a specific region homogeneous through the often violent expulsion of a minority group as opposed to its destruction. So while the specific acts taken against a protected group may be identical, perpetrators of genocide would not be satisfied with the removal of the group if it did not render it destroyed, whereas perpetrators of an ethnic cleansing campaign of would be theoretically be satisfied. Although ethnic cleansing has not been formally codified in an international treaty, the term has appeared in UN Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, the jurisprudence of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, and reports by UN experts.United Nations Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect, Ethnic Cleansing, Definitions, https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/ethnic-cleansing.shtml.  Legal Jurisdiction  = International Criminal Court = The International Criminal Court (ICC) only has jurisdiction over those who have committed crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide, or crimes of aggression.International Criminal Court, How the Court works, About, https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/how-the-court-works. Its jurisdiction is further limited to crimes that occurred within the territory of a state that has accepted the jurisdiction of the ICC (through ratification of the Rome Statute or otherwise) and to situations referred to it by the UN Security Council. Despite the referral power of the Security Council, the Court itself is not officially affiliated with the United Nations. In order for the International Criminal Court to take a case, the state must be a signed member of the Rome Statute, as this puts a country within the jurisdiction of the Court. The ICC's jurisdiction is complementary to domestic courts. So if a perpetrator is tried at a national level court, the ICC does not intervene in the case. = Nuremberg Trials = Prior to the publication of the Rome Statute and the formation of the International Criminal Court, violators of mass atrocity crimes would be brought to justice through international tribunals. Nuremberg was the first such example of these tribunals. Held as an International Military Tribunal (IMT) for the Nazis, Nuremberg became the first ever trial in which crimes against humanity had been held as a charge (they could not be charged with the crime of genocide, as it did not exist at the time). Of the 24 Nazi officials charged, 16 of them were found guilty of crimes against humanity. = ICTR & ICTY = The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is the United Nations court established in 1993 to prosecute mass atrocity crimes committed in the Balkans in the 1990s.United Nations International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, About the ICTY, United nations International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, http://www.icty.org/en/about. It addresses crimes committed from 1991 to 2001 against members of various ethnic groups in the former Yugoslavia ‚Äî Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo and Macedonia.Updated Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugolsavia, S.C. Res. 827, U.N. Doc. S/RES/827, art. 1 (May 25, 1993) (as amended July 7, 2009). This was the first war crimes court established by the UN as well as the first international war crimes tribunal since the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals. The tribunal was established by the UN Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. Since its inception, the ICTY has made precedent-setting decisions on mass atrocity crimes, including the precept that an individual's position does not protect them from prosecution.International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia Outreach, The Tribunal‚Äôs Accomplishments in Justice and Law, 3 Justice in Transition (Feb. 2006). It has also set the precedent for individualized guilt in order to protect entire communities from being labelled \\"collectively responsible.\\" It has held that the mass murder at Srebrenica was genocide as defined by international law.See, Prosecution v. Radislav Krstic, ICTY Case No. IT-98-33, Trial Judgment (Aug. 2, 2001). The ICTY has indicted over 160 individuals. The International Criminal Tribunal for RwandaInternational Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States, between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 1994, French: \\"Tribunal p√©nal international pour le Rwanda (TPIR)\\". Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. (ICTR) is an international court established by the UN Security Council to prosecute individuals of genocide and other mass atrocity crimes committed in Rwanda and neighboring states between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 1994. The ICTR is the first international tribunal to deliver verdicts of genocide and the first to interpret 1948 Genocide Convention's definition of genocide.United Nations International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, The ICTR in Brief, https://unictr.irmct.org/en/tribunal. It is also the first tribunal to define rape as a means of committing genocideProsecutor v. Akayesu, Case No. ICTR-96-4-T, Judgment, Sept. 2, 1998 as well as to hold members of media responsible for broadcasts as a tool of genocide.Prosecutor v. Nahimana et al. (Media case), Case No. ICTR-99-52, Judgment, Dec. 3, 2003. The ICTR's last trial judgement was on December 20, 2012 and is now working on appeals only. Since it opened in 1995, of the 93 individuals have been indicted by the ICTR, 62 have been found guilty of international humanitarian crimes and sentenced, 10 have been referred to national jurisdictions, 2 have died prior to verdicts, 3 fugitives have been referred to the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, and 2 indictments were withdrawn before their trials started. = The International Court of Justice = The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations.International Court of Justice, The Court, https://www.icj-cij.org/en/court; UN Charter art. 92. It can hear two types of cases: contentious and advisory.UN Charter ch. 14. Contentious cases are legal disputes between states which can only be brought by states.International Court of Justice, The Court, https://www.icj- cij.org/en/court. The only mass atrocity crime that the ICJ has jurisdiction over is genocide. Its jurisdiction was established explicitly in the Genocide Convention.Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide art. 9, Dec. 9, 1948, 78 U.N.T.S. 277. Unlike the tribunals discussed above, the ICJ cannot determine individual criminal responsibility.Global Justice Center and Global Center for the Responsibility to Protect, Q&A;: The International Court of Justice& the Genocide of the Rohingya (July 2019), http://globaljusticecenter.net/blog/19-publications/1147-q-a-the- international-court-of-justice-the-genocide-of-the-rohingya. It can clarify and interpret the Genocide Convention as well as hold states accountable for the commission or the failure to prevent or punish genocide.  Diplomatic Agreements  = Responsibility to Protect = At the 2005 World Summit, the United Nations member states made a commitment to protect against genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. This document is not binding legal agreement, but rather reaffirms all states' responsibility to protect their own populations from atrocity crimes. It additionally holds the international community responsible for holding other states' accountable for their populations.2005 World Summit Outcome, G.A. Res. 60/1, U.N. Doc. A/RES/60/1 (Oct. 24, 2005). In accordance with Chapters VI, VII, and VIII of the United Nations charter, the United Nations acknowledged at the summit its responsibility to help protect all populations through peaceful means, as well as through collective action when necessary.

There are two primary types of analgesic patches: patches containing counterirritants, which are used to treat mild to moderate pain, and patches containing fentanyl, a narcotic used to relieve moderate to severe pain in opioid-tolerant patients. Counterirritant patches Counterirritant patches contain ingredients such as capsaicin, methyl salicylate, camphor, or menthol, which are thought to mask pain signals by causing other sensations (itching, warmth, or cooling) in the areas they are applied to. In the United States, patches sold under the brand name Salonpas are approved by the Food and Drug Administration under a New Drug Application (NDA) for the treatment of mild to moderate pain caused by soft tissue injury (e.g. strains and sprains), arthritis, or backache. Other products, including brand names such as Ben Gay and Mentholatum, which are not covered by NDA, indicate relief of minor pain. Counterirritant patches are sold over the counter and do not require a prescription. Other over-the- counter products marketed for the relief of minor injury or arthritis pain include Absorbine Jr. Pain Relief, Excedrin Cooling Pads, and Icy Hot Patches. In Japan Salonpas, produced by Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical, remains a popular brand. Other manufacturers, including Yutoku Pharmaceutical, SS Pharmaceutical, and Suzuki Nippondo also produce similar over-the-counter patches containing methyl salicylate or glycol salicylate. In Australia, patches sold under the brand names Eco Pain, and Dencorub are approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and listed on the Australian Register for Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) as a Class 1 Medical Device. They are approved for sale over-the-counter for the treatment of mild pain caused by soft tissue injury (e.g. strains and sprains), arthritis, or backache. Fentanyl patches Fentanyl transdermal patches are sold under the brand name Duragesic, or as generic equivalents. Fentanyl is an opioid with rapid onset of pain relief; it is often used to treat breakthrough pain. Duragesic and similar patches release fentanyl through the skin. A patch may provide pain relief for up to 72 hours. Several deaths or life-threatening overdoses have been linked to misuse of fentanyl patches. Fentanyl patches are indicated only for patients with moderate to severe chronic pain who have been taking regular narcotic pain medication for more than a week and who are considered opioid- tolerant. Overdose can occur when patients use more patches than prescribed, change the patches too frequently, or expose the patch to heat.

Apart from the titular one, it contains other two stories: Smurftraps and Romeo and Smurfette. Plots =The Smurf Apprentice= A smurf wants to learn magic and alchemy. After some failed attempts of getting Papa Smurf's magic book, he goes to Gargamel's lab and steals one page of his magic book. However, what the potion written on the page does is written on the following page, so the only way to know what the potion does is to test it. After some failed attempts of giving the potion to the other smurfs, the Apprentice Smurf drinks it himself and becomes a green lizard-like monster that the other smurfs (save for Papa Smurf) are afraid of. Not one of Papa Smurf's attempts on an antidote works, so the Apprentice Smurf goes to Gargamel's lab after the antidote, but is captured. Papa Smurf leads the other smurfs to save him, and then they make the antidote that restores the Apprentice Smurf to his normal smurf appearance. =Smurftraps= Gargamel prepares a series of traps to capture the smurfs, while they are playing hide- and-seek. Brainy Smurf is trapped by a book, Greedy Smurf is immobilised by a sticky cake, Grouchy Smurf follows a series of directions that lead him to a hole, and so on. But the smurf who was counting watches when Gargamel catches the last of his playmates, and goes to the village to tell Papa Smurf, who then organises all the remaining smurfs for a rescue mission. However, Gargamel catches all the rescue party, save for Papa Smurf, with a giant net. Gargamel makes the smurfs do slave labor on his home, but Papa Smurf arrives at night and leaves a trace of gold coins near Gargamel's bed.

As of 2007, its southern terminus is located at an intersection with SR 102A in Tremont on the southern part of the island. Its northern terminus is at intersection with SR 3 in Bar Harbor, a terminus it shares with SR 198\\\\. Route description SR 102 passing through Acadia National Park SR 102 begins in the south at the intersection of Harbor Drive and Tremont Road in Tremont. SR 102A also has its signed northern terminus (geographically western) at this intersection. SR 102 runs due north, entering Southwest Harbor and intersecting the other end of SR 102A south of the town center. Continuing north, SR 102 enters the town of Mount Desert and Acadia National Park. Near Somesville, SR 102 intersects its former western loop on the island and later intersects SR 3/SR 198 near the Mount Desert Campground. SR 3 has its eastern terminus at this intersection, but is generally not assigned cardinal directions as it loops the eastern half Mount Desert Island in order to avoid confusion. Heading north, SR 102 is concurrent with SR 198 as the two routes enter the northwestern corner of Bar Harbor. Just before reaching Thompson Island in on the Trenton town line, the highway meets up with SR 3 once again. SR 102 and SR 198 both terminate at this intersection, with SR 3 continuing north (signed west) onto the Maine mainland. History SR 102 was originally designated in 1925 and ran between Augusta and Belfast. It has also maintained most of its routing through Mount Desert, but most of the old route was later superseded by the designation of SR 3. SR 102 was overlapped with SR 3 in Trenton and Ellsworth until 1946, when it was truncated to run between Seal Cove and its current northern terminus at SR 3 in Bar Harbor. In 1951, the southern portion of the route was extended, causing SR 102 to loop around the island clockwise along Tremont Road and Pretty Marsh Road and terminate at itself near Somes Pond, creating a lasso- shaped route in which one could be traveling due north on a road signed \\"south\\". SR 102 signage was removed from the western half of the loop in 2007, truncating SR 102 to the terminus of SR 102A in Tremont, leaving the rest of the loop unnumbered and referred to by the name Pretty Marsh Road. It was also removed from the official Acadia National Park map to match, though older Park signage at some intersections does still refer to Route 102 on this unsigned portion. Junction list Suffixed route =State Route 102A= SR 102A is a loop of SR 102 on the southeastern tip of Mount Desert Island.

Manet, due to this painting, was accepted for the first time at the Salon of Paris in 1861, where he also exhibited a portrait of his parents. The Spanish Singer received positive criticism at the time and won a decent mention. It was appreciated by French writer Charles Baudelaire, and by French journalist and literary critic Theophile Gautier, who praised the painting for its \\"very true color\\" and \\"vigorous brush\\".

It is the only species in the monotypic genus Trachyphyllia and can be found throughout the Indo-Pacific.  Description  Open brain corals can be solitary or colonial. They are small corals, rarely reaching over 20 cm in diameter. They are free-living and exhibit a flabello-meandroid growth form, meaning they have distinct valley regions separated by walls. In colonial forms, the valley regions can contain multiple individual polyps. Complexity of valley regions can range; some are hourglass shaped while other cans be highly lobed. They typically have bilateral symmetry. During the day when the polyp is closed, the coral is covered by a mantle that extends beyond the skeleton, but can retract when disturbed. Polyps and mantle are very fleshy. Colonies can be blue, green, yellow, brown, and are often vibrantly colored. The open brain coral is known to host a species of gall crab, Lithoscaptus semperi.  Distribution and habitat  A red variety of Trachyphyllia in a reef aquariumOpen brain corals can be found throughout the Indo-Pacific, from the Red Sea to New Caledonia. They are found up to a maximum depth of 40 meters. Open brain corals are less common directly in coral reef communities, and are more often found on sandy reef slopes, around continental islands, and lagoons. Open brain corals can often be found near other free-living corals. Large colonies of open brain corals are uncommon, and are typically only observed in marine protected areas.  Threats  The IUCN lists open brain corals as \\"near threatened\\" due to habitat loss and over-harvesting for the aquarium trade. The biggest exporter of open brain coral is Indonesia. In 2005, Indonesia exported over 60,000 open brain corals for use in the aquarium trade. Other threats to open brain corals include disease, acidification, and severe storms.

It is a place of Anglican worship.  History  The first Anglican communities arrivals in the Canary Islands and settled mainly in the cities of Puerto de la Cruz, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and to a lesser extent in Santa Cruz de La Palma. In Puerto de la Cruz, Anglican worship was originally held every Sunday at the home of the British Vice-Consul Peter Spence Reid, although he was a Presbyterian and a member of the Church of Scotland. In 1887 he founded the Taoro Company, which, in the same year, designated free land for the construction of an Anglican church. In November of that year the Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Sierra Leone the Rt Revd Ernest Graham Ingham visited Puerto de la Cruz and formed a committee to implement the church building project. The church was built with money donated by foreign visitors and British residents in the city. The organ, the pulpit, stained glass windows, baptismal font and other items were private donations. For its part, the parsonage and the stained glass windows were gifts from Mary Boreham and other family members.Iglesia Anglicana de Todos los Santos - Puerto de la Cruz She was the widow of Walter Long Boreham who had died in 1890. The architectural style of the church is Gothic Revival architecture. The Church of All Saints', Puerto de la Cruz, was the first Anglican church built in the Canary Islands. Puerto de la Cruz also has the archipelago's oldest Anglican cemetery. In 1964 the Anglican Church fell under the Anglican Diocese of Gibraltar.  Nowadays  Masses are held every Sunday at 9:30am (said) and 11:00am (sung), and on Wednesday at 9:30am (said).

Background Yahara Elementary in DeForest, Wisconsin, opened for the 1992-93 school year. In March 2002, 340 students at Yahara Elementary (Deforest, Wisconsin) were sent home on accordance to an issue with excessive moisture in the building causing toxic mold to grow in the ventilation ducts, pipes, and on carpets. Three teachers, a custodian, and a student were suffering with respiratory problems and were insistent on taking the company, J.H. Findorff & Son, Inc. to court because they believed the mold issues were a product of the school having been built improperly. Two of the teachers a custodian and a student were involved in the lawsuit. Trial court On August 20, 2002 the plaintiffs sued Findorff in Dane County under the safe place statute and in strict liability alleging the defects in the original design and in construction that caused the excess moisture. The circuit court concluded that the plaintiffs discovered the cause of their symptoms more than three years before filing this suit making their claims time-barred. The plaintiffs claims under the safe place statute failed because the information submitted did not show that Findorff had custody or control of the area, the negligence claims failed too because none of their witnesses offered standard care opinions regarding Findorff. The plaintiffs then appealed the decision. Decision In April 2005, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals reversed the lower court in an opinion written by judge Dykman.Caldwell v. J. H. Findorff & Son, Inc., 2005 WI App 111, 283 Wis. 2d 508, 698 N.W.2d 132. The decision stated, in regards to the statute of limitations, that when the symptoms were discovered to be caused by the HVAC system was a question of fact that must be determined by the jury. As to the standard of care on the negligence claim, the court said that plaintiffs had submitted deposition testimony from an expert that could be used to establish the standard of care. The court then remanded the case back to the circuit court for a trial.

He was accused of planning a coup against General Sani Abacha in 1995, for which he was jailed, tortured and convicted of treason. After Abacha's death he was granted a state pardon. Background and early military career Gwadabe was born in 1949 in Jos, Plateau State, where he was brought up. His father was a Muslim of Fulani origin. Major Gwadabe was involved in the coup of 27 August 1985, having just returned to 245 Recce Battalion (where he had previously been the Commanding Officer) from a course at the US Armour School, Fort Knox. He was one of the junior officers assigned the job of arresting the head of state, General Muhammadu Buhari, which they achieved without difficulty, replacing him with General Ibrahim Babangida. After the coup, Gwadabe was appointed Chairman of the Nigerian National Shipping Line. He was also Special Presidential Envoy and Chairman of the Sudan Peace Conference (1986‚Äì1990) and Special Presidential Envoy for Peace in Angola and Mozambique (1989‚Äì1990). Babangida appointed Gwabade Governor of Niger State in December 1987. During his tenure he had to cope with a severe outbreak of cerebro-spinal meningitis, which was countered with an emergency mass-vaccination. At the start of the Nigerian Third Republic in January 1992, he handed over to the elected civilian governor Musa Inuwa. Inuwa had been Commissioner for Health in Niger State, and was relieved of his position by Gwadabe so he could run for office. Sani Abacha period Gwadabe was appointed Commander of the National Guards. On 17 November 1993, escorted by a detachment of the National Guards under Colonel Gwadabe, three senior army officers arrested Ernest Shonekan, the interim civilian president of Nigeria who had been appointed by General Ibrahim Babangida. The coup led to the assumption of power by General Sani Abacha. Gwadabe served as Chief of Staff of the Gambian Army, succeeding Brigadier Abubakar Dada. On his return to Nigeria after the July 1994 Yahya Jammeh coup in Gambia, he was briefly Principal Staff Officer to General Sani Abacha before being appointed Commander of 23 Armored Brigade in Yola. On 1 March 1995, he was arrested on a charge of plotting a coup against the Abacha government, and was jailed, tortured and later convicted of treason along with others. He was on death row when Abacha died unexpectedly in June 1998. Years later, Abacha's chief of staff Lt-Gen. Oladipo Diya said that he considered that the claimed coup plot was non-existent. Later career In March 1999, the transitional military government of General Abdulsalami Abubakar granted a state pardon to Gwadabe and others accused of plotting coups against General Sani Abacha. In June 2009, President Umaru Yar'Adua granted Gwadabe and others a full pardon. In 2004, he was a leading member of the Kaduna Discussion Group, aligned with former military ruler Ibrahim Babangida. As a board member of MTS First Wireless, in January 2005, Gwadabe alleged that the chairman had been involved in fraudulent allocation of shares and misdeeds in importation of telecommunications equipment. Gwadabe was among leaders who, in 2005, were encouraging General Ibrahim Babangida to contest the 2007 presidential election. Gwadabe became a member of the board of several companies, including U2 Communications Africa and North Eastern Capital. He became CEO of Seeds Project Company and Chairman of North Eastern Integrated Oil services Ltd. His business interests include Oil and Gas, Leisure and Hospitality services. In February 2009, Gwabade was appointed chairman of the board of the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC). In August 2009, he announced that 22 ambulances were being deployed in the Federal Capital Territory to assist accident victims.

Leisure includes a broad array of activities, such as sport, tourism, and the playing of games. The sociology of leisure is closely tied to the sociology of work, as each explores a different side of the work-leisure relationship. More recent studies in the field move away from the work-leisure relationship and focus on the relation between leisure and culture. Studies of leisure have determined that observable patterns cannot be easily explained by socioeconomic variables such as income, occupation or education. The type of leisure activity is substantially influenced by the individual's situation (presence or lack of family, age, and other factors). Leisure in the United States hold a self-involved worldview, it is up to the individual to make it and determine their life. Whether there is agreement in the politics of the pull yourself up by your bootstrap's motto, it becomes a question of whether leisure time is a right or a privilege in the United States. Not everyone has leisure time in the predominantly capitalist society. The United States hold massive income inequality and with this making leisure time less accessible. Given the more capitalistic approaches and business driven policies, a scaling back of unions and workers' rights has been in effect for some time now. There were influxes of movements to unionize and guarantee workers' rights and allot more free time for workers; the 40-hour work week, benefits, bargaining power. These were philosophies of change developed from Marxism conflicting the United States individualistic societal norm. There has been an up rise in action and unionization in the united states, including teachers strikes, warehouse workers, student workers. Much of what is seen now is reflective of much of what happened in the past. The standard view of individualism may not hold over time. Theory Thorstein Veblen was one of the first sociologists to study leisure Sociology of leisure is a fairly recent subfield of sociology, compared to more traditional subfields such as sociology of work, sociology of the family, and sociology of education: it saw most of its development in the second half of the 20th century.Stanley Parker, \\"The Sociology of Leisure: Progress and Problems,\\" The British Journal of Sociology, vol. 26, no. 1, March 1975, pp. 91‚Äì101.

Last accessed on 20 January 2010Gordon Marshall, \\"Leisure, sociological studies of,\\" A Dictionary of Sociology, 1998, Encyclopedia.com. Online. Last accessed on 20 January 2010 Until then, leisure had often been seen as a relatively unimportant, minor feature of society. Leisure is now recognized as a major social institution, deserving of serious sociological inquiry, particularly in Western societies.James H. Frey, David R. Dickens, \\"Leisure as a Primary Institution,\\" Sociological Inquiry. vol. 60, no. 3, 1990, pp. 264‚Äì73, ON: 1475-682X, . As John Wilson and others have noted, it is difficult to define leisure.John Wilson, \\"The Sociology of Leisure,\\" Annual Review of Sociology, vol. 6, August 1980, pp. 21‚Äì40. Online, JSTOR Its definitions are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as a quality of experience irrespective of time. Joffre Dumazedier distinguished four distinct definitions of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually narrow in scope. The first and broadest defines leisure as a style of behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, the narrowest defines leisure as activities dedicated to self-fulfillment. Dumazedier's four definitions are not exhaustive. Incompatible definitions and measures are seen as a major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings. There are some unresolved questions concerning the definition of work: in particular, whether unpaid endeavors, such as volunteering or studying, are work. Non-work time should not be equated with free time, as it comprises not only free time, dedicated to leisure, but also time dedicated to certain obligatory activities, such as housework. Dividing activities into free and dedicated time is not easy. For example, brushing one's teeth is neither work nor leisure; scholars differ in their classifications of activities such as eating a meal, shopping, repairing a car, attending a religious ceremony, or showering (various individuals may or may not classify such activities as leisure). The relation between work and leisure can also be unclear: research indicates that some individuals find skills that they have acquired at work useful to their hobbies (and vice versa), and some individuals have used leisure activities to advance their work careers. Sociologists also disagree as to whether political or spiritual activities should be included in studies of leisure.S.R. Parker, \\"Sociology of Leisure,\\" Sociology, 10 (1), 1976, Oxford (0038-0385), p. 166. Online Further, among some occupational communities, such as police officers or miners, it is common for colleagues to be off-time friends and to share similar, work-based leisure activities. Apart from a definition of leisure, there are other questions of theoretical concern to the sociologist of leisure. For example, quantifying the results is difficult, as time-budget studies have noted that a given amount of time (for example, an hour) may have different values, depending on when it occurs‚Äîwithin a day, a week, or a year. Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in the social sciences, the study of the sociology of leisure is hampered by the lack of reliable data for comparative longitudinal studies, as there was little to no standardized data-gathering on leisure throughout most of human history. The lack of longitudinal studies has been remedied in the last few decades by recurring national surveys such as the General Household Survey in the United Kingdom (ongoing since 1971). In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on qualitative methods of research (interviews). Marx theory of leisure was discussed through a 'realm of freedom'. Karl Marx‚Äôs criticisms of capitalism, saw the structures of capital as in conflict with people truly reaching leisure.The Marx-Engels Reader. New York : Norton, 1978. Print. The basis of leisure is rooted in economics and politics, as those are intertwined also. In contrast to a more socialist approach, many would see leisure time as an excuse for unproductivity and as something you don‚Äôt deserve. Not that it shouldn‚Äôt be attained but shouldn‚Äôt get in the way of economics. Therein lies our current structures that Marx‚Äôs theories have not only remained relevant, but his criticisms of his time can remain true to this day. Marx‚Äôs criticism of capitalism was rooted in the exploitation of the worker. As a conflict against the worker, class warfare in affect. In the Marx and Engels Reader, an overview of the writings and theories of Marxism, the ‚Äòrealm of freedom‚Äô and ‚Äòrealm of necessity‚Äô were heavily elaborated on as it was a new concept at the time. The realm of freedom is a true definition of leisure as it embraces doing activities out of the want, pleasure to do so. Whereas living to survive and work, eat, sleep would be in the realm of necessity. Research An example of a lesure activity: american soldiers playing a card game. Over time, emphasis in studies of leisure has shifted from the work-leisure relation, particularly in well-researched majorities, to study of minorities and the relation between leisure and culture. Marshall Gordon noted that there are two approaches in the study of leisure: formal and historical-theoretical. The formal approach focuses on empirical questions, such as the shifting of leisure patterns over an individual's life cycle, the relation between leisure and work, and specific forms of leisure (such as the sociology of sport). The historical-theoretical approach studies the relation between leisure and social change, often from structural-functionalist and neo-Marxist perspectives. Sheila Scraton provided a different analysis, comparing North American and British studies. The British approaches focus on input from pluralism, critical Marxism, and feminism; the American approaches concentrate on the social-psychological tradition. Rhona and Robert Rapoport studied the worklife balance and inequality in many countries, wrote many books in this area and help influence policy and legislation to change practices. Within the framework of the family, leisure time has been researched to measure the effect of families during weekend work, further written about in, Weekend Work and Leisure Time with Family and Friends: Who Misses Out? What was found was families in which a parent/s had to work on the weekend had a negative effect on the family, more particularly the children. It was written that many of the parents who had to work on the weekend were less educated and lower income. This could have implications for the family and society. Children not being able to be with their parents, parents not making enough to take more time off, not being able to see their children has broad implications on one‚Äôs health. Let alone the stress of being in a constant state of work. There are different forms of leisure time and it could always be debated. However, for those who do see movies as a form of entertainment can reap some benefits. Going to the movies, alone or with friends can improve health and well being. Findings Many sociologists have assumed that a given type of leisure activity is most easily explained by socioeconomic variables such as income, occupation or education. This has yielded fewer results than expected; income is associated with total money spent on such activities, but otherwise only determines what type of activities are affordable. Occupation has a similar effect, because most occupations heavily influence a person's income (for example, membership in a prestigious occupation and \\"country-club\\" activities such as golf or sailing are significantly correlated‚Äîbut so is membership in those occupations and high income, and those activities with high cost). Education is correlated with having a wide range of leisure activities, and with higher dedication to them. As Kelly noted, \\"Predicting a person's leisure behavior on the basis of his socioeconomic position is all but impossible.\\"J. Kelly, \\"Socialization toward Leisure: a Developmental Approach,\\" Journal of Leisure Research, vol. 6, 1974, pp. 181‚Äì93. On the other hand, type of leisure activity is substantially influenced by the individual's immediate situation‚Äîwhether he has a family, whether there are recreational facilities nearby, and age. Early family influences, particularly involving the more social leisure activities, can be profound. The type of leisure activity also depends on the individual's current place in the life cycle. Specific findings in sociological studies of leisure are illustrated by John Robinson's late-1970s study of American leisure. Robinson found that Americans, on average, have four hours of leisure time each weekday, and more on weekends‚Äîsix hours on Saturdays, almost eight on Sundays.John Robinson, How Americans Use Their Time: A Social-Psychological Analysis of Everyday Behavior, New York, Praeger, 1977, pp. 89 Amount of leisure time diminishes with age, work, marriage, and children. However, the amount of free time does not significantly depend on an individual's wealth. People desire less free time if they are uncertain of their economic future, or if their job is their central interest. During the second half of the twentieth century, watching television became a major leisure activity, causing a substantial decrease in the time dedicated to other activities; in the early 1970s the average American had 4 hours of leisure per day, and spent 1.5 of them watching television.J. Robinson and P. Converse, \\"Social Change Reflected in the Use of Time,\\" in A. Campbell and P. Converse, eds., The Human Meaning of Social Change, New York, Russell Sage, 1972, pp. 17‚Äì86. Shared leisure activities increase marital satisfaction.  Future implications  In an increased digital age and growing technologies, our forms of entertainment have changed. Perhaps so will working. Automation has been of rising concern and perhaps the Marxist view of technology as a tool to allow more leisure time will win. Then again workers have had a long fight of gaining power than losing it. As is with most structures the amount or even any leisure time you have can be determined by race. As evolved as society has appeared, the structures that have kept a stratified system hasn‚Äôt changed much. If leisure is to be allocated equally than the systems in place that have been in place since the beginning may need to be looked into.

The following year she was the dominant filly of her age group and after winning eight important stakes, was voted the 1971 Eclipse Award for American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly.

She returned to form in February 1972 but as the bettors' longshot when she won the Santa Maria Handicap and paid $190.40 for a $2 winning ticket.Los Angeles Times February 20, 1972 She then won the Santa Margarita Handicap in March, again defeating Typecast as well as another top-rated filly, Convenience. After that, Turkish Trousers finished off the board in her next starts and was retired at the end of the year. Breeding record As a broodmare, Turkish Trousers' offspring met with limited success. From her four foals that raced, her best was probably the 1976 filly Persona, sired by Tom Rolfe, who won four of thirty-two starts and earned US$102,225.

HarperCollins) The Child Thief is a 2009 dark fantasy novel by the artist and novelist Gerald Brom.http://www.bromart.com A dark retelling of the stories of Peter Pan and The Lost Boys, Brom takes many liberties with the originals by J M Barrie. Brom incorporates monsters and faeries, as well as a poverty-ridden populace in New York. Synopsis The novel begins with a prologue. A young girl awaits her abusive father, only to be rescued by a boy with auburn hair, freckles, pointy ears, and golden eyes. He comforts the girl, telling her of a place where there are no grown-ups and lots of adventure. The girl goes with him. The novel follows several characters in their adventures through Avalon, an enchanted isle in its final death throes. Brom makes liberal use of Celtic and Scottish mythology as, in a parallel storyline, he describes Peter's history from birth to Lord of Deviltree. Peter's clan of human children is the final force between the Flesh Eaters and The Lady. The Lady's magic keeps Avalon alive and the Mist up to keep out unwanted humans while, unfortunately, keeping the Flesh Eaters in. The Lady is trapped within the heart of Avalon, a prisoner in her own land by her nephew and Avalon's heir apparent, Lord Ulfger. The children at Deviltree are also affected by the magic of Avalon. However, being children, they were not twisted into malicious scaly creatures. Instead they grew strong, fast, and amazingly powerful. They were honed into warriors, fighting alongside Peter to save Avalon and The Lady and rid the land of the Flesh Eaters. Peter spends his time searching for new children to take back to Avalon. Always searching in the poorest neighborhoods, Peter only takes those children that are abused, forgotten, or, his personal favorite, runaways. Many children die in the Mist. Many more die fighting for their lives in Avalon, and Peter must go out seeking blood for Deviltree. The story reaches its climax with all of the forces meeting in a final unexpected clash that will shake the order of things in both worlds forever. Literary analysis =Children as warriors= The children become merciless, bloodthirsty and savage. Taken from abusive homes, they leave for a place where there are children from similar backgrounds. Brom discusses The Child Thief - Brom, HarperCollins, 2009 how this relates to gang culture. The children are slowly affected by Avalon's magic and become a powerful force. This knowledge of superiority coupled with the right circumstance could easily cause innocent children to become killing machines. Judging from what goes on in modern gang culture, seeing how quick teens are to define their own morals, to justify any action no matter how horrific, I believe it wouldn't be that hard. (Brom, The Child Thief) =Humans as monsters= The Flesh Eaters were a group of Puritans who set out to the new world from England, as well as the crews of the ships that carried them. They became trapped in Avalon when their arrival promoted the Lady of the Lake to shroud the island in a magical mist to avoid further arrivals. When they came to Avalon they were people no worse or better than others of their time, but after 300 years they have degenerated in body and soul to resemble demonic creatures with horn and black scales. In addition to being corrupted by the magic of avalon, their desperation to escape over the long years have driven them to further madness. In the most extreme cases they have become twisted caricatures of themselves, so that The Reverend, originally a just and inspiring man has become no more than a fanatical sadist. Even those among the group who have not fallen into degeneracy mostly go along with those who have, either out of fear, complacency or simply the desire to band together against the dangers of the land. The beasts of Avalon were -- before the Flesh Eaters -- a light and airy people who cared only for merriment and joy, and even when danger or serious matters pressed upon them. They worship the pagan gods of the land, who live and walk among them. They would like nothing more than for the Flesh Eaters to leave, which is the same goal the Flesh Eaters have, though by the time of the novel the hatred between them has grown too deep for them to work together on any common task. Characters =Devils= * Peter : A main character and \\"Lord\\" of Deviltree, his only apparent goal is to gather children to fight the Flesh Eaters and save Lady Modron. Peter's mood often changes between that of a hardened warrior and a child, especially when recalling fallen Devils. He has red hair, pale, freckled skin, golden eyes, and pointy ears. He wears hand-stitched leather pants with pointy-toed shoes sewn in, a raggedy, tailed tuxedo jacket over a black hoodie, and a rawhide pack. * Nick : A major character, Nick's story begins as he runs away from home, where a drug lord tenant and his minions torment Nick, his mother, and his grandmother. He is cornered by several other boys when Peter comes to his rescue. Once they are through the Mist he is left with the other Devils as a \\"new blood\\". Nick is fourteen, slender and a bit small for his age, with dark, choppy bangs, and a pallid complexion. * Cricket : A New Blood at Deviltree, she arrived there a little before Nick. It is implied she was the girl from the prologue. She becomes good friends with Nick, and there is some attraction between them. She has a scar above her ear where her hair no longer grows, from before she came to Avalon. * Sekeu : The most experienced warrior at Deviltree with the exception of Peter, she has been in Avalon since the first colonists settled in America. She is Native American, with golden eyes, dark hair, lean, muscular features, and a regal bearing. She teaches the New Bloods at Deviltree how to fight, and acts as leader when Peter is out. * Redbone: He has been at Deviltree since 1974 and is one of Peter's more experienced warriors. He rubs a red dye into his skin and hair, creating a devilish effect, and ties a red bone into the wild top knot on his head. He wears a beat-up, but genuine, leather jacket. His grin is fierce and wide and his eyes are squinty and fiendish. A scar runs down his face right between his eyes. * Leroy : The most experienced of the New Blood, Leroy is crafty and self-serving. He bullies and intimidates Nick, and eventually becomes a Devil by falsely claiming to have performed Nick's acts of bravery. * The Lady: Peter and his followers live to serve the Lady. Lady Modron (also known as The Lady of the Lake), daughter of the god Avallach, rules as the queen of Avalon. It appears that she uses her healing powers to entrance the inhabitants of Avalon into a spell of unconditional love, and devotion to her and Avalon itself.

The story takes places in the last years of the Cold War where mysterious and unknown artifacts called out- of-place artifacts were discovered in various parts of the world, leading to secret wars between various forces against the ARCAM Corporation, an organization that placed itself the guardians of the OOPArts in order to prevent them from being used as weapons.  Protagonists  = Yu Ominae = *Origin: Japan *Age: 17 *Ability: Extraordinary Martial Arts with Omihalcon suit. is the main leading protagonist, stationed at ARCAM's Japanese branch. He is also a former member of COSMOS. He is known for being a high school delinquent to his teachers and classmates, but he is also secretly a special Spriggan agent for the international conglomerate ARCAM Corporation. As such, Yu gets thrown into missions in and out of Japan when out-of-place artifacts are involved in a mission. Yu is called upon by ARCAM to conduct black ops for the company, which results in several disruptions from his studies. His most dangerous mission to date was to be deployed into the South Pole in order to eliminate the South Pole Shrine. After the successful operation in eliminating the rampaging Fire Snakes from the South Pole Shrine and defeating Markson's Trident forces in the South Pole, Yu was seen attending college after graduating from his high school. He is still posted at ARCAM's Japanese branch, where he attends to a mission in Mexico in order to secure the Gold Statue of Pachacamac and ensure the safety of his classmate, Nanako Kondo. = Jean Jacquemonde = *Origin: France *Age: 24 *Ability: Super speed, lycanthropy transformation is a French Spriggan operator who is based in ARCAM's French branch. His werewolf appearance is mainly due to use of ancient biotechnology that gave him the ability to shapeshift into one. During his time with the Spriggans, he actively assists Yu Ominae in battling enemies of the ARCAM Corporation from Turkey all the way to the forests of Japan while fighting foes from Machiner's Platoon soldiers to brainwashed COSMOS child soldiers. In his first appearance in Turkey, Jean has his first werewolf transformation when Little Boy riddles him with a barrage of bullets. Eventually killing his assailant in his werewolf stage, Jean overcomes platoons of Machiner's Platoon soldiers sent to stop him. When Jean is deployed in a mission to Romania, he confronts his father who told him of his heritage. In an operation in Ecuador, Jean is severely wounded by Oboro and left for dead. Fortunately for Jean, Percup Ramdi performs an operation that manages to heal Jean of his wounds and further accelerates his rate of self- healing. In a mission to prevent COSMOS from extracting Rie Yamabishi to the US, Jean stormes a US Army base in Japan along with Yu and Oboro. However, they are unable to prevent COSMOS forces from escaping. Jean, grudgingly, teams up with Iwao Akatsuki and Bo Brantz, two of ARCAM's most fearsome enemies, in sabotaging a Trident operation when Larry Markson attempted to harness the power of the South Pole Shrine in order to take control of the world. With Bo's death, the three took on Larry's forces before they were able to get rid of the Fire Snake with the help of Yoshino Somei, Rie Yamabishi and other ARCAM personnel who were forced to assist Trident in gaining access to the fiery artifact. = Tea Flatte = *Origin: British *Age: Possibly 22 *Ability: Calling beasts , whose real name is Tea Flatte Arcam, is a British Spriggan operator stationed in ARCAM's British headquarters. Born in Britain during the times of the wizard Merlin, he bestowed upon her immortality and made her go out and protect Alien Artifacts from being used for the wrong purposes. Tea possesses a special ability called \\"Calling Beast\\" that allows her to summon illusions to fool enemies into insecurity and have their souls drained. She first participates in Romania for an assignment with Yu and the others to investigate what Trident agents were doing in the country. Later on, she is dispatched to Britain to subdue a group of Neo-Nazi militants that are trying to secure the Holy Grail. She teams up with Yu and Yoshino in defeating Kutheimer's group when the Adolf Hitler clone attempts to use the Vajrayana scepter after her and the other ARCAM agents and Yoshino before it blew up due to its overuse. Tea later participates, in a side role, in assisting Yu's infiltration of the S.S. Eugenio E to recover the Ark of the Covenant, which was captured by Trident operator Sidewinder. = Oboro = *Origin: Japanese *Age: Unknown *Ability: Qigong Martial Arts is a skilled Qigong martial artist and is capable of paralyzing his opponents with a single touch, known as Dim Mak. Oboro is called on by the ARCAM Corporation to infiltrate a Neo-Nazi faction in Egypt. His cover is responsible for helping Yu and Suzuko Kawahara neutralize Kutheimer's operations in Egypt. Oboro later participates with Yu in a mission to Iraq to protect Sister Kate, who had the Apocrypha of Rockis, which cultists from the Magier Heunri Balez wanted to use in conjuring demons. Later on, Oboro returns to Thailand and assists Yu and Yoshino in fighting against Cheng, who had honed his Qigong skills in order to seek revenge against Oboro. Later, Oboro apparently betrays ARCAM due to his attacking an ARCAM Special Private Army detachment in Pakistan and is able to defeat Jean Jacquemonde in his werewolf form, thereby placing him in critical status. An enraged Yu defeats Oboro in single combat, but Oboro walks away with bruises on his face while smiling at his former student. However, towards the end of the manga, he assists Yu in disabling Trident's communications with Takashi, which prevents Larry Markson from calling in additional reinforcements to the South Pole.  Antagonists  = Iwao Akatsuki = *Origin: Japanese *Age: Late 30s *Ability: Martial Arts First appearing in the Forest of No Return chapter, states that he wishes to team up with Yu Ominae and escape the forest. Although Yu sees him as an enemy as ARCAM and Trident were battling for control of the out-of-place artifacts, the two eventually work together with Yoshino Somei to escape the cursed forest. Iwao later appears in Romania as part of a Trident taskforce to eliminate Yu and other Spriggans.

Keen won his first decoration before ever seeing combat when he saved a fellow pilot from drowning on 17 June 1916. Once in France, his combat record saw him promoted to flight, then squadron commands. The latter posting made him a major at age 23. Background and education Keen was born in Edgbaston, Warwickshire, to Arthur Thomas Keen and Isabel Charlotte Eliza (n√©e Willan). He was educated at Aldro, Dunchurch Hall and Rugby Schools before going up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1913 to study engineering. Military service Keen left university after two years, abandoning his degree studies, in order to join the Army. He was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the Army Service Corps on 24 May 1915. In November 1915 he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps and attended the School of Instruction at Wantage Hall, Reading, Berkshire, before moving to Catterick, Yorkshire, for flying training. He was granted Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate No. 2298 on 17 January 1916, flying a Maurice Farman biplane. On 15 February he was appointed a flying officer and transferred to the General List, and was promoted to lieutenant on 1 June. On 17 June Lieutenant Robert Edward Andrew MacBeth crashed into the sea off Montrose. Keen, who witnessed the crash from the air, promptly landed his aircraft nearby and swam out to help MacBeth to shore. He was subsequently awarded the Bronze Medal of the Royal Humane Society. Keen was then posted to No. 70 Squadron RFC in France, flying the Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter.Franks (2000), p.26.

The Mod Act was passed with aim of increasing the voluntary compliance with customs laws and improvements to customs enforcement. It introduced two new customs concepts known as \\"informed compliance\\" and \\"shared responsibility.\\" These concepts are premised on the idea that to maximize voluntary compliance with Customs laws and regulations, the trade community needs to be clearly and completely informed of its legal obligations. Accordingly, the Mod Act imposes a greater obligation on Customs to provide the public with improved information concerning the trade community's responsibilities and rights under Customs and related laws. In addition, both the trade and Customs share responsibility in carrying out import requirements. The Mod Act has been described as the most sweeping regulatory reform legislation since the U.S. Customs Service (now Customs and Border Protection or CBP) was organized in 1789 and it has become a benchmark for customs authorities around the world.U.S. Customs Today, Everything Changed (February, 2003) Features The principal features of the Mod Act are: *improvements in customs enforcement generally; *enhanced regulatory audit procedures; *clarified drawback authority and new drawback penalties for false drawback claims (previously, U.S. customs laws had no penalties for companies that filed false claims, and as such companies had no incentive to expend the effort to file the claims correctly.); *the creation of a National Customs Automation Program; and *the acceptance of reconciliations with respect to prior entry summaries. Section 637 of the Mod Act amended section 484 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and imposed on importers for the first time a statutory duty to exercise \\"reasonable care\\" in providing CBP with accurate and timely classification, appraisement and other data upon importing cargo. CBP then establishes the final classification, appraisement and rate of duty applicable to an imported good based on the importer's data. Importers face penalties for failing to exercise reasonable care. The Mod Act also contained several amendments to the enforcement powers of CBP. * To the extent that an importer fails to use reasonable care, Customs may impose Section 592 penalties. * Section 615 amended section 509 of the Tariff Act, creating new recordkeeping penalties for importers up to $100,000. * Section 621 amended section 592 to apply existing penalties for false information to information transmitted electronically and allows Customs to recover unpaid taxes and fees resulting from other section 592 violations.

After attending the Columbus College of Art and Design in Columbus, Ohio for a short time, he apprenticed to mural artist Robert Dafford. After 15 years with Dafford Murals, Roe left to pursue his own art career. He currently resides in Lafayette, Louisiana. Biography Roe was in born 1974 in Portsmouth, Ohio. He spent his childhood across the Ohio River in Greenup County, Kentucky, but moved to Portsmouth while in his teens. In 1992 he received a scholarship to the Columbus College of Art and Design in Columbus, Ohio and attended his freshman year there in 1992 to 1993. In the summer of 1993 he met the Louisiana mural artist Robert Dafford when he started a mural project in Portsmouth. Roe subsequently apprenticed to and worked for Dafford for 15 years. During that time Roe worked on Dafford mural projects in Portsmouth, Ohio; Paducah, Maysville, and Covington, Kentucky, New Orleans, Louisiana; Vicksburg, Mississippi; and Pine Bluff, Arkansas. Subjects painted by Roe as a Dafford muralist include Native American history, early settlers such as Daniel Boone and Simon Kenton, Carnegie Libraries, industries such as river barges and hospitals, labor unions, African-American heritage, and local notables such as Rosemary Clooney. In May 2003 he was photographed painting the Lewis and Clark Expedition mural in Paducah by photographer Jim Roshan as part of the America 24/7 project. The image was used in Roshan's book Kentucky24/7 published in 2004. Roe was the only Dafford muralist to work on all of the Paducah murals, completing several of them entirely by himself. In 2007 Roe left Dafford Murals to pursue his own commissions and devote more time to his own artwork under the name ChromeSun Productions. In 2009 he collaborated with Dafford on a poster project for the Zydeco Cajun Prairie Scenic Byway, in which he did the preliminary digital painting for the design. The year-long project highlights many local spots of interest. In 2010, Roe painted two new murals in Paducah and Vicksburg. In July, he painted Evening Roll Call in Paducah, a mural depicting the 100-year history of local Boy Scouts of America Troop 1. The mural was dedicated on National Scouting Sunday February 6, 2011 with a parade and other festivities. In the fall of 2010, Roe teamed up with another former Dafford muralist, Benny Graeff, to paint the 55-foot \\"Run Thru History\\" mural in Vicksburg, Mississippi. Roe's current artwork focuses on the traditional southwestern Louisiana Cajun celebration of the Courir de Mardi Gras. It is a series of hyper-realistic depictions of costumed celebrants playing music, dancing on the backs of horses, and chasing after chickens. Work =Techniques and style= Mural detail on Clark Athletic Complex Roe conducts extensive research to develop his works and shows acute attention to detail. They are typically started as Adobe Photoshop sketches, often based on models and surroundings he has lighted and digitally photographed. His compositions are often influenced by classical art, and he cites European artists of the sixteenth and seventeenth century Michelangelo, Peter Paul Rubens, and Caravaggio as major influences. For his historical murals, he will often pick a particular artist or illustrator from the time period he is depicting to emulate; thereby he can stylistically invoke the era. After the composition is decided upon, he transfers it to the painting surface either by scaling the design and doing a grid transfer or with an overhead projector. He paints the murals either with industrial acrylic enamels or the longer lasting silicate mineral paints. His oil paintings are done in a classical realist style, and subjects include portraiture, photo- realist abstract compositions, and historical illustration. These oil paintings may contain from three to 20 layers, from underpainting to the final colored glazes. Roe also does conservation work on murals. =Exhibits= * In 2002 Roe was part of an exhibition with artist Wayne Ditch at the Cite des Arts in Lafayette, Louisiana during the Festival International de Louisiane. * In 2008 he was included in the Acadiana Center for the Arts \\"Southern Open\\", an annual juried show open to residents of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.

The murals depict the three sports played at the new facility: a baseball game, tennis match, and football game. *In the summer of 2010 Roe added a new mural to the Paducah Wall to Wall Project, showing the 100-year history of the local Boy Scout troop. Troop 1 is one of only a handful of troops who share their centennial with the centennial of the national scouting organization itself. The dedication for the mural was held on National Scout Sunday, February 6, 2011. * Roe teamed up with Benny Graeff, a fellow former Dafford muralist, to paint the 55-foot long \\"Run thru History\\" mural in Vicksburg, Mississippi in the fall of 2010 .

The Misteri are amongst the oldest continuously running religious events in Europe, having been played every Good Friday since before the Easter of 1612, and running for at least 16 continuous hours, but occasionally well beyond the 24 hours, are the longest religious festival in Sicily and in Italy.www.italia.it A short Video of The Easter Procession.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0oLzEOLtVw  History  In the late middle age and early renaissance the phenomenon of the Passion plays had spread in most Catholic countries. Passion plays, also when springing from a sincere religious devotion, were anyway occasionally mutating in farces, a trend which became more widespread in the early 16th century, to the obvious discomfiture of the Catholic hierarchies, who then started to oppose them. The Procession in the night In the late 16th century, religious authorities but also lay authorities ended up to forbid or anyway to strongly limit passion plays in various place around Europe, meanwhile in certain areas, like in parts of the then sprawling Spanish Empire, these started to be substituted by processions of figurative art depicting the various episodes of the Passion of Jesus. Just like the procession of the pasos in Seville, or the procession of the vare in Caltanissetta or in many similar processions in various parts of the contemporary Spanish Empire, in Trapani at some point during the Counter- Reformation the episodes of the passion of Jesus started to be narrated through sculptural groups who were created from local artists. As the most famous contemporary historian of the story of the city of Trapani, Francesco Pugnatore, does not mention the existence of the Misteri in its magnum opus, the much detailed 'Historia di Trapani' published in 1594, we can reasonably presume that the procession of the Misteri was not held before at least the latter part of the 16th century. As the Fellowship of the Precious Blood of Christ and of the Mysteries (in Latin Societas Pretiosissimi Sanguinis Christi et Misteriorum), one of the two religious societies which were managing the procession of the Misteri in the early to middle 17th century, was founded by in 1603, and the procession is explicitly referred on a document notarized the 20 April 1612, the deed of trust on which the Guild of the Journeymen was granted the caretaking of the group representing the Ascent to Calvary, we can also reasonably assume that the procession of the Misteri was surely held before the Easter of 1612.  The sculptures  The 'Misteri' are an artistic representation of the Passion and Death of Jesus through twenty sculptural groups, including two statues of the Dead Jesus and of the Lady of Sorrows. They were granted in trust, by deeds, by the Brotherhood of St. Michael the Archangel, which instituted the rite in the late 16th century, to the members of the local Guilds in exchange of the promise to carry them during the passion procession every Good Friday.

Ecology  Wirenia argentea is a marine species as all other solenogastres. Wirenia argentea lives in depth range of 95‚Äì700 m. Wirenia argentea is a carnivore and it eats Cnidaria.Todt C. & Salvini-Plawen R.

Ontogeny  Solenogastres develop via a trochophore-like lecitotrophic larva with a preoral apical cap that at least partly represents an enlarged prototrochal area. Wirenia argentea deposit small batches of uncleaved embryos that are tightly enclosed by a smooth and transparent egg hull. Cleavage is spiral and unequal. The ciliated larvae hatch about 45 hours after deposition and swim actively in the water column. Within 48‚Äì60 hours after hatching they become mushroom-shaped with a pronounced apical cap partly enclosing a posterior trunk. The cells covering the apical cap are large and cleavage arrested. On the apical cap there is a prominent prototrochal band of compound cilia and an apical ciliary tuft and the trunk bears a terminal ciliary band (telotroch). Obscured by the apical cap, a ciliary band originates in the stomodaeal pore and surrounds the trunk. As development is proceeding, the trunk elongates and becomes covered by cuticle with the exception of a ventral ciliary band, the future foot. The larvae have a pair of protonephridia. At 5 days after hatching they begin to settle and within the following 7‚Äì9 days the apical cap is gradually reduced. Scattered epidermal sclerites form under the cuticle. Wirenia argentea lack iterated groups of sclerites at any developmental stage. At 40 days after hatching, the postlarvae have a fully developed foregut, but the midgut and hindgut are not yet interconnected.  Genetics  18S ribosomal RNA gene of Wirenia argentea has been analyzed in 2010 and it contains 2161 bp with strong secondary structures and with 63.12% of guanine-cytosine clamps.Meyer A., Todt C., Mikkelsen N.

Early life Jacinto B. Trevi√±o was born in Guerrero, Coahuila on 11 September 1883. His father was Francisco A. Trevino, a former cornel of National Guard, and his mother was Trinidad Gonz√°lez. He received his primary education in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, and completed his college preparatory schooling in a government high school.Stout, Joseph, ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòBorder Conflict‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, 1999, page 23. Early military career Trevi√±o entered into Military Academy at Chapultepec Mexico City in 1900 and graduated 1908. He entered the artillery corps upon graduation. He did not participate in the Madero rebellion of 1911.Stout, Joseph, ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòBorder Conflict‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, 1999, page 24. Madero When Francisco Madero became President in November 1911, Trevi√±o was promoted to Captain and served on the President's staff. In 1912, he participated in the campaign to suppress the Pascual Orozco rebellion. Upon the conclusion of hostilities, he was assigned to the state government of Coahuila to help organize the state militia. In this position, he developed a close relationship with the state governor Venustiano Carranza. Constitutionalism In February 1913, President Madero was overthrown and murdered by a right-wing coup d‚Äô√©tat known as The Ten Tragic Days. Trevi√±o joined Governor Carranza in refusing to pledge allegiance to the new government of Victoriano Huerta. Closely aligning himself with Carranza, he was one of the first signatories of Carranza's Plan of Guadalupe which claimed the Huerta government was illegitimate. Two days after signing the Plan, he was dishonorably discharged from the Federal Army. Carranza commissioned him a major in the new Constitutionalist Army to be formed to drive out the Huerta government. Trevi√±o participated in the military battles that Carranza fought in Coahuila during the spring and summer of 1913. On March 7, 1913, Carranza and Trevi√±o won a battle over Federal troops at Anhelo. However, most of their battles were defeats and so Carranza decided to abandon Coahuila and set up his rebel government in Sonora which had been secured by the Constitutionalists there. Trevi√±o accompanied Carranza in the five-week trek from Coahuila to Hermosillo Sonora between August and September 1913.Stout, Joseph, ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòBorder Conflict‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, 1999, page 24. Shortly after arriving in Hermosillo, Carranza appointed Trevi√±o as his Chief-of-Staff. In June 1914, Carranza promoted Trevi√±o to brigadier general under General Pablo Gonz√°lez. Carranza's Constitutional forces were victorious and drove out the right-wing government of Victoriano Huerta in July 1914. However, the victorious Constitutionals then split into two camps: those who continued to support Carranza, and those who were opposed to his continued leadership, primarily headed up by Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata. A peace convention was held in Aguascalientes in October 1914 which hoped to resolve the differences between Carranza and Villa. Trevi√±o participated in the Convention of Aguascalientes as a supporter of Carranza. The Convention failed to bring peace, and in December 1914, open warfare broke out between the forces of Pancho Villa and the forces that supported Carranza. Battles Pancho Villa In his first independent command, Trevi√±o was ordered to take command of the Constitutionalists forces in the Tampico area, and keep the oil-rich region out of the hands of the Villistas. On December 29, 1914, Trevi√±o held off a Villista attempt to capture Tampico.Juan Barrag√°n Rodr√≠guez's \\"Historia del Ej√©rcito y de la Revoluci√≥n Constitucionalista\\" In January 1915, Trevi√±o again held off a force of Villistas commanded by General Manuel Chao. Trevi√±o is credited with constructing good defensive breastworks at El Ebano while Chao has been criticized for conducting unimaginative frontal attacks.Juan Barrag√°n Rodr√≠guez's \\"Historia del Ej√©rcito y de la Revoluci√≥n Constitucionalista\\" In February 1915, the forces of Manuel Chao were reinforced by the forces of Tomas Urbina. Again, Trevi√±o held firm.Juan Barrag√°n Rodr√≠guez's \\"Historia del Ej√©rcito y de la Revoluci√≥n Constitucionalista\\" On March 21, 1915, Chao and Urbina renewed their attack on El Ebano again. This was to be one of the longest and most deadly battles of the Revolution. For 72 days, the forces of Chao and Urbina attacked Trevi√±o at El Ebano, and each time, Trevi√±o held.Juan Barrag√°n Rodr√≠guez's \\"Historia del Ej√©rcito y de la Revoluci√≥n Constitucionalista\\" Villa finally tired of this attack, and ordered Chao and Urbina to disengage and move the majority of their commands to the Celaya region where he was battling √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n. A small Villista command remained at El Ebano that was intended to hold Trevi√±o in check. However, on May 31, Trevino advanced out of his barricades and defeated the Villistas. For keeping the oil-rich region out of the hand of Pancho Villa, he was proclaimed a war- hero and promoted to major general. He was then given command of the Army of the Northwest headquartered in the city of Chihuahua.Juan Barrag√°n Rodr√≠guez's \\"Historia del Ej√©rcito y de la Revoluci√≥n Constitucionalista\\" In April and May 1915, Pancho Villa and √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n engage in several long and deadly battles in the Celaya region of Mexico. The end result was that in early June 1915, Pancho Villa's army was destroyed, and the remnants of his army retreated north to Chihuahua. While Villa's army was broken, he continued to wage guerrilla war in the state of Chihuahua. Trevi√±o battled Villa throughout the latter half of 1915, and most of 1916, but he was never able to stop Villa. On January 1, 1916, Trevi√±o announced that 14,000 Villistas had surrendered and that the Villa insurgency was over.Johnson, William Weber, ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòHeroic Mexico‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, 1968, page 298. Still, Villa continued to raid the countryside. In March 1916, Villa attacked Columbus, New Mexico, which outraged the American newspapers.Johnson, William Weber, ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòHeroic Mexico‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, 1968, page 310. President Wilson responded by sending American troops under the command of General Pershing into Chihuahua to pursue Villa. This incursion into Mexico is known as the Punitive Expedition or the Pancho Villa Expedition.Johnson, William Weber, ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòHeroic Mexico‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, 1968, page 311. On March 27, 1916, Villa took the city of Guerrero Chihuahua from Trevino's troops. However, Villa was wounded in the battle, and was unable to command for the next six months. Trevi√±o, the Mexican government and the American government all believed that Villa was dead and that insurrection was over.Katz, Friedrich, ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòThe Life and Times of Pancho Villa‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, 1998, page 572. Villa recovered from his wounds and on September 6, 1916 raided Satev√≥, Chihuahua.Eisenhower, John, ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòIntervention!‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, 1998, page 303. Then in his boldest move, he attacked Trevino's headquarters in the city of Chihuahua on September 16, Independence Day. Trevi√±o and his command were forced to flee the city, while Villa captured arms and ammunitions, and freed political prisoners.Stout, Joseph, ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòBorder Conflict‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, 1999, page 107-108.Johnson, William Weber, ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòHeroic Mexico‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, 1968, page 315.Eisenhower, John, ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòIntervention!‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, 1998, page 304.Katz, Friedrich, ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòThe Life and Times of Pancho Villa‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, 1998, page 588. For the next two months, Villa continued to raid at will, while Trevi√±o appeared to be continually surprised, and unable to coordinate any offensive operations.Stout, Joseph, ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòBorder Conflict‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, 1999, page 110. At this point, President Carranza and Secretary of War Obreg√≥n begin to lose confidence in Trevi√±o. On November 6, Obreg√≥n wired Trevi√±o telling him that he would be replaced by General Francisco Murgu√≠a.Stout, Joseph, ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòBorder Conflict‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, 1999, page 119. On November 27, before Murgu√≠a arrived, Villa again attacked Trevino's headquarters at the city of Chihuahua, and again forced Trevino to evacuate the city.Stout, Joseph, ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòBorder Conflict‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, 1999, page 127. On December 1, 1916 the combined forces of Trevi√±o and Murgu√≠a defeat a Villista force at Horcasitas south of the city of Chihuahua, and Villa main force was forced to abandon the city.Stout, Joseph, ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòBorder Conflict‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, 1999, page 130.Johnson, William Weber, ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòHeroic Mexico‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, 1968, page 315.Katz, Friedrich, ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄòThe Life and Times of Pancho Villa‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, 1998, page 627. Murgu√≠a was highly critical of Trevi√±o and an enmity developed between the two. Murgu√≠a was much more aggressive and successful against Villa, and Trevi√±o fell into disfavor. Post Revolution As the year 1920 approached, the succession of President Carranza became an issue. Carranza by law could not run for re-election, but he planned to choose his successor. Alvaro Obreg√≥n announced his candidacy, but Carranza did everything in his power to prevent the election of Obreg√≥n. Obreg√≥n had the support of most of the military, and when it became clear that Carranza would not allow Obreg√≥n to succeed him, Obreg√≥n's supporters revolted and overthrew Carranza. Trevi√±o at this time was a subordinate of Pablo Gonz√°lez; they both owed their positions to Carranza. After much deliberation, they decided to support Obreg√≥n in the 1920 Agua Prieta revolt. When Congress voted to install Adolfo de la Huerta to fill out the remainder of Carranza's term, de la Huerta appointed Trevi√±o to be his Secretary of Industry and Commerce. In March 1929, Trevi√±o supported the Escobar Rebellion, and when that rebellion failed, Trevi√±o was forced to flee to the United States. The Mexican army discharged him for his participation. Trevi√±o was allowed to return to Mexico in 1941 and allowed back into the army as a major general. He was appointed the Director of the National Bank of the Army in 1947. He served in the senate between 1952 and 1958. He died in Mexico City on November 5, 1971.

They are all collected here.  Du Du Du  \\"Du Du Du\\" was a one-off single by Alexia released in 2007 as a digital download. It did not feature on any of Alexia's studio albums and was the last recording of hers to be released by Sony Music, ending a partnership that had gone on since 1996. The song features both English and Italian lyrics. It was released on 13 July 2007, a few months after Alexia gave birth to her daughter. The title of the track is a vocal hook rather than an Italian phrase, with the song being about Alexia not wanting to lose the feelings she has with her lover, and that tonight is the night it is all going to happen, as she and her lover are going to pretend there are no limits with their sex, with the song making reference to having a child. Notably, this was the first song Alexia released after marrying her husband Andrea Camarana (nephew of Georgio Armani) and having a daughter, so it is highly likely this influenced the direction of the song. =Music video= No video was issued for the song.  Grande Coraggio  \\"Grande Coraggio\\" was the first single release from Alexia's eighth studio album Ale and was presented to Italian Radio on 30 May. As this was the first release from a new album, a CD was issued for release. The title translates as 'Great Courage' and is about how everyday mistakes are made, and life can be unnerving but that courage does not want us to fail, that it is always there even if you do not realise it, do not yield when things go bad as there is a goal in life that will be achieved. =Music video= Two videos were filmed for the release which was the first release by Alexia on Edel after leaving Sony Music in 2007, though one was a shorter version of the song intended to promote the forthcoming album. It was the first video clip Alexia had filmed since 2005's Da Grande,  Guardarti Dentro  \\"Guardarti Dentro\\" was the second and final single release from Alexia's eighth studio album Ale and was presented to Italian Radio on 19 September. As the single was a one track release from an album that was already out (and did not differ to the album version), no separate download or artwork was issued. The title translates as \\"To Look At You Inside\\" with the song being about Alexia's lover not really knowing her as he does not have the courage to look inside himself and thus will suffer torment. =Music video= The video featured Italian actors Roberto Farnesi, Kledi Kadiu, Primo Reggiani, Rossella Brescia, Giorgia Surina and Roberta Scardola and premiered at the Roma Videoclip Festival.  Biancaneve  \\"Biancaneve\\" was the first single from Alexia's re-released Ale & C album, released in 2009. It was a duet with Italian singer Mario Lavezzi and the song featured on Lavezzi's album 'A Piu Voci'. The song is about Biancaneve, the Italian name for Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, with 'Bianacaneve' translating as 'Snow White'. The song alternates between Lavezzi and Alexia with them both singing the chorus and final verse together. In the song, Lavezzi sings how Alexia makes him feel like a prince, whilst Alexia sings about the temptation of the apple, saying she feels she has more in common with the witch. They both sing how neither will regret the paradise they can both offer to each other. The song was a big hit for the duo, reaching number 1 on the Italian digital chart and number 6 on the combined singles chart. The duo performed the track at the 2009 Sanremo Festival, coming fourth. =Music video= No video was issued for the song.  Come Nessuno (Lately)  \\"Come Nessuno (Lately)\\" was the Italian release of the song 'Lately', part of the Global One project releasing the same song simultaneously around the world albeit in local languages. The idea was \\"Inspired by the idea of uniting artists, languages and cultures around a common theme and five brilliant songs, the Global One project truly promotes the concept of strength through unity, harnessing the power of their collective fan base to rocket its stars onto the global stage.http://globalonemusic.com/about/ \\" The Italian version was recorded and sung by Alexia and Andrea Dianetti, though the latter was not credited on the release. The song was released as a digital download on May 19, 2009. An additional track was available on the download the 'Lately multimix' which featured various versions of the Lately song in its different languages. =Music video= A video was filmed for the song with each language version dubbed over it. No artist involved appeared in the video. It is the only Alexia single release to have a video that does not feature Alexia.  We Is The Power  \\"We Is The Power\\" was the second single release from Alexia's re- released album Ale & C and was released on 12 June. It is a re-recording of the song \\"Il Branco\\", which featured on her album Ale. The track was re- recorded in English with additional production from Bloom 06 (previously two thirds of Italian dance act Eiffel 65). Jeffery from Bloom 06 shared lead vocals with Alexia. The two acts had known each other for quite some time as both had previously been involved in Eurodance music. It was the first Alexia release in English since 2004's \\"You Need Love\\". As the single was a one-track release from an album that was already out (and did not differ from the album version), no separate download or artwork was issued. The track 'Il Branco' which the song is translated from means 'The Pack' in English. The theme of the English version is along the same lines as the Italian version, in that people have the power to change the world themselves, that boundaries are only limited by yourself. The Italian chorus sings about dreams tattooed on the skin that can not be removed, and the fire to achieve them burns in our eyes whereas the English version sings of holding onto dreams that will burn forever more. The Italian middle8 sings of the pride of being part of 'The Pack' and that 'he wants you' whereas the English middle8 sings of letting go to passion and to be guided by the fire within you. It is assumed that the grammatical error in the English title is deliberate as both artists have released various songs in grammatically correct English in the past.  E Non Sai  \\"E Non Sai\\" was the third single release from Alexia's re-released album Ale & C and was released on 9 October with the video following on 18 October. It is a re-recording of the song which featured on her album Ale. The track was re-recorded with Italian drag queen singer Madame Sisi (Carlo Tessari). As the single was a one track release from an album that was already out (and did not differ to the album version), no separate download or artwork was issued. The title translates as 'And You Do Not Know' with the song being about the love between two people, how it started and ended and how it has changed their lives, though the one person does not know who they are, with the other knowing they have a physical and emotional desire for them, and how now they 'wander between so many people only in search of you'. =Music Video= As with her 2008 single, Guardarti Dentro, the video for E Non Sai was premiered at the Roma Videoclip Festival, with the video featuring actors Anna Foglietta, Arthur Colombini and ballerina Ilir Shaqiri.E non sai - Wikipedia, Retrieved 2011-12-04  References  Category:Alexia (Italian singer) songs ","title":"Alexia digital singles"},{"id":"26685567","text":"Lotte Hotels and Resorts is a South Korean luxury hotel chain operated by Lotte Hotel Co., Ltd., the hospitality arm of Lotte Corporation.

History The Spanish used Bah√≠a de Navidad for ship building, repairs, and as a jumping off point to the Philippines in the mid-16th century. In recent years, the Jalisco state government has promoted this zone as a tourist attraction, grouping all these beaches under the common name of \\"Costalegre\\". =Hurricane Patricia= On October 23, 2015, Costalegre was hit by the category 5 storm Hurricane Patricia, which was the most powerful cyclone ever measured in the Western Hemisphere with sustained wind speeds of up to 320 km/h (200 mph). Hurricane Patricia made landfall October 23 at 7:45pm with catastrophic damage. The center of the storm hit Cuixmala in Costalegre.NOAA/ National Weather Service, National Hurricane Center, Hurricane PATRICIA Public Advisory, Oct 23, 9:00am PST Costalegre Bays and Beaches =Bah√≠a de Banderas (Flag's Bay)= Officially, not a part of Costalegre itself, but separates Puerto Vallarta from the rest of the coast, and marks the top most northern point of Costalegre. =Cabo Corrientes (Cape of Currents)= Founded in 1944, Cabo Corrientes is a Municipality with over 80 kilometers of scenic highways and 200.106 hectares of forest surrounded by rivers and cascades. Some of its beaches are already very well known due to its proximity to Puerto Vallarta, like Las √Ånimas, Quimixto and Yelapa, often considered as part of Vallarta by the tourists, but which are in fact just a minor part of the large Cabo Corrientes's coast. The Tuito is the municipal head of Cabo Corrientes and the oldest population of the municipality. It is located south of Puerto Vallarta. The ruins of the Ex- Hacienda San Jos√© are an attraction that dates from 1875; as well as the ancient petroglyphs in Las Juntas and Los Veranos. In Boca de Tomatl√°n, pangas (taxi boats) take tourists to the beaches. Las √Ånimas ‚Äî is a sand beach in a zone suitable for diving, with coral formations and the associated marine fauna. Quimixto ‚Äî Known for its horse rides and long walks, has a 10-meter high waterfall; has a large restaurant zone. In the passage between Quimixto and Yelapa there are small beaches such as Las Caletas, Majahuitas and Colimilla. Suitable for diving, with coral formations and the associated marine fauna. Yelapa ‚Äî A large creek where the Tuito river ends. It has a small and traditional town, with a beach and swimming. Mayto ‚Äî More than 15 kilometers of beach. Here is located one of the largest of Mexico's protected sea turtles reproduction fields, part of the international Sea Turtle Restoration Project where guided routes are offered to know a little more about the species that arrive at this beach. On scheduled times, it is possible to participate in the release of newborn turtle babies to the sea. The place has a colorful hotel, but Mayto is more dedicated to the turtle's preservation than tourism. Tehuamixtle ‚Äî A place known for its large oysters, has a beach about 200 meters long. =Costa Majahuas= A long coast with several beaches: Punta Las Pe√±itas, Hotelito Desconocido, Majahuas, Pe√±itas y Chalacatepec. Chalacatepec ‚Äî is a beach 25 minutes from the municipal head of Tomatl√°n. On its shore there is a pirate ship wrecked long ago which now forms part of the traditional legends of the place. La Pe√±ita Pintada ‚Äî (Painted Lil'Rock) gained its name due to a natural granodiorite cavity, whose walls, bottom and ceiling have several ancient paintings on them. Owing to the large number of visitors, there are visitor periods scheduled only on specific times of the year. =Bah√≠a de Chamela= A large, undeveloped bay surrounded by several islands. Home to marine and terrestrial birds, it has more than ten kilometers of varied marine and fluvial scenes. It has an assembly of small islands like La Colorada, Cocinas, San Andr√©s, Pajarera (reserve of exotic birds and ideal place for diving), Novilla, Esfinge, San Pedro, San Agust√≠n, and La Negrita, all of them accessible by boat. =Costa Careyes= Costa Careyes is a private community located on the South Coast of Jalisco on Highway 200 Melaque ‚Äì Puerto Vallarta at Kilometer 53. There are several beaches in the Careyes Bay. Teopa Beach is the largest and includes a sea turtle preservation sanctuary[1]. The community was founded in 1968 by Gian Franco Brignone[2] as his private estate. The Castles, Villas, Casitas, Bungalows and Restaurants that comprise Careyes today function as a resort and are known for the \\"Careyes Style\\" of architecture. = Cuixmala = Cuixmala is 10 minutes of the south Careyes, in the vegetation of a 3 km beach. It was the private estate of James Goldsmith, and was originally conceived as a private home for his family and friends. It has a of land, lagoon and beaches. Originally designed by Robert Couturier, it is now an eco-resort based on green culture. Its name means \\"the soul's resting place\\" in Spanish. =Bah√≠a de Tenacatita= Some kilometers ahead of Tamarindo Beach, it is located Bah√≠a de Tenacatita, one of largest bays of the Mexican Coast. This zone has crab, snail, clam, lobster and squid fishing, according to the time of the year. Both sunrise and sunset can be seen over the sea during winter. It has seven beaches: Manzanilla, Boca de Iguanas, Los √Ångeles Locos, Punta Serena, Tenacatita and Tecu√°n. =Bah√≠a de Navidad= This is the most urban developed bay, located at the south of Costalegre series of beaches. It has a traditional town named Barra de Navidad with a population of 7000+, a small farming and fishing community located on the east end of the Bah√≠a de Navidad, 60 km north of Manzanillo. The beachfront fronting the sandbar arcs toward San Patricio, Jalisco 4.5 kilometers to the west. The large lagoon behind Barra de Navidad is criss-crossed by small fishing boats gathering scallops and transporting visitors and locals from Barra to Isla Navidad and the Grand Bay Hotel, recently voted the Number One hotel/resort in Mexico by the Travel Channel. Taxi boats also carry passengers to and from the small community of Colimilla where restaurants line the shore. Melaque ‚Äî Towards the northwest of Bah√≠a de Navidad, is the extensive beach of Melaque, of smooth surge, regular slope and sand of texture average gilded gray color. Melaque is conformed by the towns of San Patricio and Villa Obreg√≥n, this last one also has its own series of small beaches known as \\"Beaches of the Sun\\". The locality of San Patricio takes its name from the Irish Saint Patrick, and celebrates him on Saint Patrick's Day, 17 March. Cuastecomate ‚Äî A beach of fine gray sand that extends throughout 250 meters. Suitable for aquatic sports such as sailing, swimming, diving and fishing. Tamarindo is a peninsula in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It has a professional 18-hole golf course south of Tenacatitla. A 150-hectares ecological reserve where an extensive variety of animals coexist, including armadillos, iguanas, deer, raccoons and many exotic birds. Culture =Mariachi= Mariachi groups are usually hired for festive occasions. =Huichol people= A Huichol artisan in traditional dress. In the north of Jalisco, the indigenous Huichol people live in towns in mountainous areas that are difficult to access. They call themselves wixarica, \\"The People,\\" in their own language. The name \\"Huichol\\" is derived from the name that was given to them by Nahuatl speakers. Along Constalegre it is possible to find Huichol handmade crafts, drapes and traditional toys. Related to Nahuatl, the Huichol language belongs to the Coracholan branch of the Uto- Aztecan language family. Gastronomy =Drinks= Jalisco is the center of the Mexican tequila industry. The volcanic soil covering much of the state of Jalisco is particularly well suited for the cultivation of the blue agave plant, which is used as the base for tequila. Traditional alcoholic drinks Aguamiel and Pulque are made from maguey, similar to the plants used to produce tequila. Along the streets of the town street vendors sell Tejuino, a cold beverage made from fermented corn. Tepache is also found on these places, a drink made out of the flesh and rind of the pineapple, sweetened with brown sugar and cinnamon. Both are slightly fermented and have a minimal alcohol content. =Traditional food= Dishes of Jalisco include Birria, (a spicy meat stew, made of goat, cow or iguana meat), red or white pozole, sopes, guacamole, frijoles charros, Menudo (stew made of hominy and tripe with a red chili base), torta ahogada (a Mexican sandwich \\"drowned\\" in a spicy sauce), Carne en su jugo, Enchiladas rojas y verdes, Cuachala (a chicken or pork stew), tamales, Lamb al pastor. The traditional Yelapa Pie is found only on Yelapa beach. Many kinds of fish and seafood are available in the large coastal region of Costalgre.

It is an example of defence mechanism, since these are unconscious or conscious coping techniques used to reduce anxiety arising from unacceptable or potentially harmful impulses thus it can be a defence mechanism in some ways. Defence mechanisms are not to be confused with conscious coping strategies. Thought suppression is a method in which people protect themselves by blocking the recall of these anxiety-arousing memories. For example, if something reminds a person of an unpleasant event, his or her mind may steer towards unrelated topics. This could induce forgetting without being generated by an intention to forget, making it a motivated action. There are two main classes of motivated forgetting: psychological repression is an unconscious act, while thought suppression is a conscious form of excluding thoughts and memories from awareness. History Sigmund Freud Neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot was the first to do research into hysteria as a psychological disorder in the late 19th century. Sigmund Freud, Joseph Breuer, and Pierre Janet continued with the research that Charcot began on hysteria. These three psychologists determined that hysteria was an intense emotional reaction to some form of severe psychological disturbance, and they proposed that incest and other sexual traumas were the most likely cause of hysteria.Stoler, L., Quina, K., DePrince, A.P., and Freyd, J.J. (2001). Recovered memories. In J. Worrell (Ed.) Encyclopedia of Women and Gender, Volume Two. (pp 905-917). San Diego, California and London: Academic Press. The treatment that Freud, Breuer, and Pierre agreed upon was named the talking cure and was a method of encouraging patients to recover and discuss their painful memories. During this time, Janet created the term dissociation which is referred to as a lack of integration amongst various memories. He used dissociation to describe the way in which traumatizing memories are stored separately from other memories. The idea of motivated forgetting began with the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in 1894. Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud had similar views on the idea of repression of memories as a form of self-preservation. Nietzsche wrote that man must forget in able to move forward. He stated that this process is active, in that we forget specific events as a defense mechanism.Nietzsche, F. (1994). On the Genealogy of Morals. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press. The publication of Freud's famous paper, \\"The Aetiology of Hysteria\\", in 1896 led to much controversy regarding the topic of these traumatic memories. Freud stated that neuroses were caused by repressed sexual memories,Freud, S. (1896). The Aetiology of Hysteria. The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, Volume III (1893-1899): Early Psychoanalytic Publications. which suggested that incest and sexual abuse must be common throughout upper and middle class Europe. The psychological community did not accept Freud's ideas, and years passed without further research on the topic. It was during World War I and World War II that interest in memory disturbances was piqued again. During this time, many cases of memory loss appeared among war veterans, especially those who had experienced shell shock. Hypnosis and drugs became popular for the treatment of hysteria during the war. The term post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was introduced upon the appearance of similar cases of memory disturbances from veterans of the Korean War. Forgetting, or the inability to recall a portion of a traumatic event, was considered a key factor for the diagnosis of PTSD. Ann Burgess and Lynda Holmstrom looked into trauma related memory loss in rape victims during the 1970s. This began a large outpouring of stories related to childhood sexual abuse. It took until 1980 to determine that memory loss due to all severe traumas was the same set of processes. The False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF) was created in 1992 as a response to the large number of memories claimed to be recovered. The FMSF was created to oppose the idea that memories could be recovered using specific techniques; instead, its members believed that the \\"memories\\" were actually confabulations created through the inappropriate use of techniques such as hypnosis. Theories There are many theories which are related to the process of motivated forgetting. The main theory, the motivated forgetting theory, suggests that people forget things because they either do not want to remember them or for another particular reason. Painful and disturbing memories are made unconscious and very difficult to retrieve, but still remain in storage. Retrieval Suppression is one way in which we are able to stop the retrieval of unpleasant memories using cognitive control. This theory was tested by Anderson and Green using the Think/No-Think paradigm. The decay theory is another theory of forgetting which refers to the loss of memory over time. When information enters memory, neurons are activated. These memories are retained as long as the neurons remain active. Activation can be maintained through rehearsal or frequent recall. If activation is not maintained, the memory trace fades and decays. This usually occurs in short term memory.Hebb, D. 0. 1949. The Organization of Behavior. Wiley, New York. The decay theory is a controversial topic amongst modern psychologists. Bahrick and Hall disagree with the decay theory. They have claimed that people can remember algebra they learnt from school even years later. A refresher course brought their skill back to a high standard relatively quick. These findings suggest that there may be more to the theory of trace decay in human memory. Another theory of motivated forgetting is interference theory, which posits that subsequent learning can interfere with and degrade a person's memories. This theory was tested by giving participants ten nonsense syllables. Some of the participants then slept after viewing the syllables, while the other participants carried on their day as usual. The results of this experiment showed that people who stayed awake had a poor recall of the syllables, while the sleeping participants remembered the syllables better. This could have occurred due to the fact that the sleeping subjects had no interference during the experiment, while the other subjects did. There are two types of interference; proactive interference and retroactive interference. Proactive interference occurs when you are unable to learn a new task due to the interference of an old task that has already been learned. Research has been done to show that students who study similar subjects at the same time often experience interference.Chandler, M. J., & Ball, L. (1989). Continuity and commitment: A developmental analysis of identity formation process in suicidal and non-suicidal youth. In H. Bosma & S. Jackson (Eds.), Coping and self-concept in adolescence (pp. 149-166). Heidelberg: Springer Verlag. Retroactive interference occurs when you forget a previously learnt task due to the learning of a new task. The Gestalt theory of forgetting, created by Gestalt psychology, suggests that memories are forgotten through distortion. This is also called false memory syndrome. This theory states that when memories lack detail, other information is put in to make the memory a whole. This leads to the incorrect recall of memories. Criticisms The term recovered memory, also known in some cases as a false memory, refers to the theory that some memories can be repressed by an individual and then later recovered. Recovered memories are often used as evidence in a case where the defendant is accused of either sexual or some other form of child abuse, and recently recovered a repressed memory of the abuse. This has created much controversy, and as the use of this form of evidence rises in the courts, the question has arisen as to whether or not recovered memories actually exist.Ofshe, R. & Watters, E. (1994). Making Monsters: false memories, psychotherapy and sexual hysteria. New York: Scribner. In an effort to determine the factuality of false memories, several laboratories have developed paradigms in order to test whether or not false repressed memories could be purposefully implanted within a subject. As a result, the verbal paradigm was developed. This paradigm dictates that if someone is presented a number of words associated with a single non-presented word, then they are likely to falsely remember that word as presented. Similar to the verbal paradigm is fuzzy-trace theory, which dictates that one encodes two separate things about a memory: the actual information itself and the semantic information surrounding it (or the gist). If we are given a series of semantic information surrounding a false event, such as time and location, then we are more likely to falsely remember an event as occurring.Pezdek, K. (1995). What types of childhood event are not likely to be suggestively planted? Paper presented at the Annual meeting of the Psychonomic Society, Los Angeles. Tied to that is Source Monitoring Theory, which, among other things, dictates that emotionally salient events tend to increase the power of the memory that forms from said event. Emotion also weakens our ability to remember the source from the event. Source monitoring is centralized to the anterior cingulate cortex. Repressed memory therapy has come under heavy criticism as it is said that it follows very similar techniques that are used to purposefully implant a memory in an adult. These include: asking questions on the gist of an event, creating imagery about said gist, and attempting to discover the event from there. This, when compounded with the fact that most repressed memories are emotionally salient, the likelihood of source confusion is high. One might assume that a child abuse case one heard about actually happened to one, remembering it with the imagery established through the therapy. Repression thumb30 0pxalt=Effects of repression on memory consolidationEffects of repression on memory consolidation The idea of psychological repression was developed in 1915 as an automatic defensive mechanism based on Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic model in which people subconsciously push unpleasant or intolerable thoughts and feelings into their unconscious.Freud, S. (1957). Repression. In J. Strachey (Ed. & Trans.), The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud (Vol. 14, pp. 146‚Äì158). London: Hogarth When situations or memories occur that we are unable to cope with, we push them away. It is a primary ego defence mechanism that many psychotherapists readily accept.Bruhn, A. R. (1990). Earliest childhood memories: Vol.1. Theory and application to clinical practice. (New York: Praeger) There have been numerous studies which have supported the psychoanalytic theory that states that murder, childhood trauma and sexual abuse can be repressed for a period of time and then recovered in therapy.Bower, G. H. (1990). Awareness, the unconscious, and repression: An experimental psychologist's perspective. (In J. Singer (Ed.), Repression and dissociation: Implications for personality, theory, psychopathology, and health (pp. 209‚Äî231). Chicago: University of Chicago Press.) Repressed memories can influence behavior unconsciously, manifesting themselves in our discussions, dreams, and emotional reactions. An example of repression would include a child who is abused by a parent, who later has no recollection of the events, but has trouble forming relationships. Freud suggested psychoanalysis as a treatment method for repressed memories. The goal of treatment was to bring repressed memories, fears and thoughts back to the conscious level of awareness. Suppression Thought suppression is referred to as the conscious and deliberate efforts to curtail one's thoughts and memories.Wegner, D.M. (1989). White bears and other unwanted thought. New York: Viking/ Penguin. Suppression is goal-directed and it includes conscious strategies to forget, such as intentional context shifts. For example, if someone is thinking of unpleasant thoughts, ideas that are inappropriate at the moment, or images that may instigate unwanted behaviors, they may try to think of anything else but the unwanted thought in order to push the thought out of consciousness. In order to suppress a thought, one must (a) plan to suppress the thought and (b) carry out that plan by suppressing all other manifestations of the thought, including the original plan. Thought suppression seems to entail a state of knowing and not knowing all at once. It can be assumed that thought suppression is a difficult and even time consuming task. Even when thoughts are suppressed, they can return to consciousness with minimal prompting. This is why suppression has also been associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder. =Directed forgetting= Suppression encompasses the term directed forgetting, also known as intentional forgetting. This term refers to forgetting which is initiated by a conscious goal to forget.Alan Baddeley, Michael W. Eysenck & Michael C. Anderson.,2009. Memory. Motivated Forgetting (pp. 217-244). New York: Psychology Press Intentional forgetting is important at the individual level: suppressing an unpleasant memory of a trauma or a loss that is particularly painful.Freud, A. (1946). The ego and the mechanisms of defense (C. Baines, Trans.). New York: International Universities Press. (Original work published 1936) The directed forgetting paradigm is a psychological term meaning that information can be forgotten upon instruction. There are two methods of the directed forgetting paradigm; item method and list method. In both methods, the participants are instructed to forget some items, the to-be-forgotten items and the to-be- remembered items. In the item method of directed forgetting, participants are presented with a series of random to-be-remembered and to-be-forgotten items. After each item an instruction is given to the participant to either remember it, or forget it. After the study phase, when participants are told to remember or to forget subsets of the items, the participants are given a test of all the words presented. The participants were unaware that they would be tested on the to-be-forgotten items. The recall for the to-be-forgotten words are often significantly impaired compared to the to-be-remembered words. The directed forgetting effect has also been demonstrated on recognition tests. For this reason researchers believe that the item method affects episodic encoding. In the list method procedure, the instructions to forget are given only after half of the list has been presented. These instructions are given once in the middle of the list, and once at the end of the list. The participants are told that the first list they had to study was just a practice list, and to focus their attention on the upcoming list. After the participants have conducted the study phase for the first list, a second list is presented. A final test is then given, sometimes for only the first list and other times for both lists. The participants are asked to remember all the words they studied. When participants are told they are able to forget the first list, they remember less in this list and remember more in the second list. List method directed forgetting demonstrates the ability to intentionally reduce memory retrieval. To support this theory, researchers did an experiment in which they asked participants to record in a journal 2 unique events that happened to them each day over a 5 day period. After these 5 days the participants were asked to either remember or forget the events on these days. They were then asked to repeat the process for another 5 days, after which they were told to remember all the events in both weeks, regardless of earlier instructions. The participants that were part of the forget group had worse recall for the first week compared to the second week. There are two theories that can explain directed forgetting: retrieval inhibition hypothesis and context shift hypothesis. The Retrieval Inhibition Hypothesis states that the instruction to forget the first list hinders memory of the list-one items. This hypothesis suggests that directed forgetting only reduces the retrieval of the unwanted memories, not causing permanent damage. If we intentionally forget items, they are difficult to recall but are recognized if the items are presented again. The Context Shift Hypothesis suggests that the instructions to forget mentally separate the to-be-forgotten items. They are put into a different context from the second list. The subject's mental context changes between the first and second list, but the context from the second list remains. This impairs the recall ability for the first list. Psychogenic amnesia Motivated forgetting encompasses the term psychogenic amnesia which refers to the inability to remember past experiences of personal information, due to psychological factors rather than biological dysfunction or brain damage Psychogenic amnesia is not part of Freud's theoretical framework. The memories still exist buried deeply in the mind, but could be resurfaced at any time on their own or from being exposed to a trigger in the person's surroundings. Psychogenic amnesia is generally found in cases where there is a profound and surprising forgetting of chunks of one's personal life, whereas motivated forgetting includes more day-to-day examples in which people forget unpleasant memories in a way that would not call for clinical evaluation. =Psychogenic fugue= Psychogenic fugue, a form of psychogenic amnesia, is a DSM-IV Dissociative Disorder in which people forget their personal history, including who they are, for a period of hours to days following a trauma.Hunter, I. M. L. (1968). Memory. Harmondsworth, UK: Penguin Books A history of depression as well as stress, anxiety or head injury could lead to fugue states. When the person recovers they are able to remember their personal history, but they have amnesia for the events that took place during the fugue state. Neurobiology Prefrontal cortex Motivated forgetting occurs as a result of activity that occurs within the prefrontal cortex. This was discovered by testing subjects while taking a functional MRI of their brain. The prefrontal cortex is made up of the anterior cingulate cortex, the intraparietal sulcus, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. These areas are also associated with stopping unwanted actions, which confirms the hypothesis that the suppression of unwanted memories and actions follow a similar inhibitory process. These regions are also known to have executive functions within the brain. The anterior cingulate cortex has functions linked to motivation and emotion. The intraparietal sulcus possesses functions that include coordination between perception and motor activities, visual attention, symbolic numerical processing, visuospatial working memory, and determining the intent in the actions of other organisms.Grafton, Hamilton (2006). \\"Dartmouth Study Finds How The Brain Interprets The Intent Of Others.\\". Science Daily. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex plans complex cognitive activities and processes decision making. The other key brain structure involved in motivated forgetting is the hippocampus, which is responsible for the formation and recollection of memories. When the process of motivated forgetting is engaged, meaning that we actively attempt to suppress our unwanted memories, the prefrontal cortex exhibits higher activity than baseline, while suppressing hippocampal activity at the same time. It has been proposed that the executive areas which control motivation and decision-making lessen the functioning of the hippocampus in order to stop the recollection of the selected memories that the subject has been motivated to forget. Examples =War= American soldiers on the battle front of the Korean War. Motivated forgetting has been a crucial aspect of psychological study relating to such traumatizing experiences as rape, torture, war, natural disasters, and homicide. Some of the earliest documented cases of memory suppression and repression relate to veterans of the Second World War.Rivers, W.H.R. (1917). The Repression of War Experience. Section of Psychiatry. 1-20. The number of cases of motivated forgetting was high during war times, mainly due to factors associated with the difficulties of trench life, injury, and shell shock. At the time that many of these cases were documented, there were limited medical resources to deal with many of these soldier's mental well-being. There was also a lesser understanding of the aspects of memory suppression and repression. Case of a soldier (1917) The repression of memories was the prescribed treatment by many doctors and psychiatrists, and was deemed effective for the management of these memories. Unfortunately, many soldier's traumas were much too vivid and intense to be dealt with in this manner, as described in the journal of Dr. Rivers. One soldier, who entered the hospital after losing consciousness due to a shell explosion, is described as having a generally pleasant demeanor. This was disrupted by his sudden onsets of depression occurring approximately every 10 days. This intense depression, leading to suicidal feelings, rendered him unfit to return to war. It soon became apparent that these symptoms were due to the patient's repressed thoughts and apprehensions about returning to war. Dr. Smith suggested that this patient face his thoughts and allow himself to deal with his feelings and anxieties. Although this caused the soldier to take on a significantly less cheery state, he only experienced one more minor bout of depression. =Abuse= Many cases of motivated forgetting have been reported in regards to recovered memories of childhood abuse. Many cases of abuse, particularly those performed by relatives or figures of authority, can lead to memory suppression and repression of varying amounts of time. One study indicates that 31% of abuse victims were aware of at least some forgetting of their abuse and a collaboration of seven studies has shown that one eighth to one quarter of abuse victims have periods of complete unawareness (amnesia) of the incident or series of events. There are many factors associated with forgetting abuse including: younger age at onset, threats/intense emotions, more types of abuse, and increased number of abusers. Cued recovery has been shown in 90% of cases, usually with one specific event triggering the memory. For example, the return of incest memories have been shown to be brought on by television programs about incest, the death of the perpetrator, the abuse of the subject's own child, and seeing the site of abuse. In a study by Herman and Schatzow, confirming evidence was found for the same proportion of individuals with continuous memories of abuse as those individuals who had recovered memories. 74% of cases from each group were confirmed. Cases of Mary de Vries and Claudia show examples of confirmed recovered memories of sexual abuse. =Legal controversy= Motivated forgetting and repressed memories have become a very controversial issue within the court system. Courts are currently dealing with historical cases, in particular a relatively new phenomenon known as historic child sexual abuse (HCSA). HCSA refers to allegations of child abuse having occurred several years prior to the time at which they are being prosecuted. Unlike most American states, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand have no statute of limitations to limit the prosecution of historical offenses. Therefore, legal decision-makers in each case need to evaluate the credibility of allegations that may go back many years. It is nearly impossible to provide evidence for many of these historical abuse cases. It is therefore extremely important to consider the credibility of the witness and accused in making a decision regarding guiltiness of the defendant. One of the main arguments against the credibility of historical allegations, involving the retrieval of repressed memories, is found in false memory syndrome. False memory syndrome claims that through therapy and the use of suggestive techniques clients mistakenly come to believe that they were sexually abused as children. In the United States, the statute of limitations requires that legal action be taken within three to five years of the incident of interest. Exceptions are made for minors, where the child has until they reach eighteen years of age. There are many factors related to the age at which child abuse cases may be presented. These include bribes, threats, dependency on the abuser, and ignorance of the child to their state of harm. All of these factors may lead a person who has been harmed to require more time to present their case. As well, as seen in the case below of Jane Doe and Jane Roe, time may be required if memories of the abuse have been repressed or suppressed. In 1981, the statute was adjusted to make exceptions for those individuals who were not consciously aware that their situation was harmful. This rule was called the discovery rule. This rule is to be used by the court as deemed necessary by the Judge of that case. =Psychogenic amnesia= Severe cases of trauma may lead to psychogenic amnesia, or the loss of all memories occurring around the event.
