During the conflict he flew with the Corpo Aereo Italiano (CAI, Italian Air Corps) during the Battle of Britain, fought over Libya and Tunisia, and was involved in the defence of the Italian mainland. Gorrini was credited with 19 (24 according to some sources) enemy planes shot down plus 9 damaged, of several types: Curtiss P-40, Spitfire, P-38 Lightning, P-47 Thunderbolt, B-17 \\"Flying Fortress\\" and B-24 Liberator. He claimed his air victories flying the biplane Fiat C.R.42 and monoplanes Macchi C.202 and C.205 Veltro. Gorrini was the top scoring C.205 pilot.

He shot down his first aircraft on 16 April 1941, over Derna, in Cyrenaica, Libya.Neulen 2000, p. 48. A Fiat CR.42 in Regia Aeronautica service. Flying this nimble biplane, Gorrini scored his first victory on 16 April 1941, over Derna, in Cyrenaica. While flying alone a CR. 42, during a protection sortie, he intercepted two of the first Bristol Beaufighters, just arrived in the Mediterranean Theater. Gorrini opened fire, immediately before the two British aircraft reached the airstrip N 1 on Ftheja, were his 85ª Squadriglia was based. Manfredi 1978, pp. 80-82 He shot the leader aircraft from a distance of 700-800 meters, scoring hits on the right wingtip. While the second Beaufighter was taking evasive action, Gorrini closed to a distance of 250 meters hitting again the other Bristol. The British aircraft was by now on the Italian airstrip so Gorrini strafed it a third time and the Beaufighter crashed just south of the airstrip. Manfredi 1978, pp. 80-82 He was credited with a kill and a damaged. He shot 1,100 rounds. On 29 May, Gorrini intercepted two Blenheim bombers over Benghazi. He shot down one that fell just outside the city, and shot all the remaining rounds at the other Blenheim that managed to escape.Pagliano, Franco. Aviatori Italiani. Milano: Longanesi, 1969. Repatriated with his unit, on 29 August he was on Caselle Torinese airfield to start the training on the new monoplane fighters, the Fiat G.50 and Macchi C.200.Manfredi 1978, p. 99. Gorrini and the rest of 18° Gruppo moved lately on Mirafiori base and then to Ciampino Sud airfield, where the training on the G.50 and the C.200 came to an end on 10 December when his Gruppo flew with Macchi C.200s to Lecce and then to the new base of Araxos, in Greece.Manfredi 1978, p. 105. During winter 1941-42 he escorted convoys between Italy and Greece. On 17 December, in the air space around Argostoli port, in Kefalonia island, intercepted two Bristol Blenheims, painted in black. He attacked the leading aircraft hitting it repeatedly and then strafed the second. The two aircraft disappeared in the clouds and Gorrini was credited with a \\"probable\\" and a \\"damaged\\". Gorrini had no other chance to clash with the enemy and he flew back to Italy with his Gruppo, on 25 April 1942.Manfredi 1978, p. 107. Back in Italy, Gorrini and his fellow pilots were trained to fly the C.200 as a fighter-bomber until mid- July. On 23 July, the 18° joined the 23° Gruppo on Abu Haggag base, in North- Africa.Manfredi 1978, pp. 111-113. There, Gorrini flew protection sorties for Axis ships and ground-attack missions. When in October the 4° Stormo was moved back, it delivered his Macchi C. 202s to the 3°Stormo.Manfredi 1978, p. 131. \\"At last, with the Macchi 202 we had a competitive plane. But when they threw over us, during Allied offensive, a whole host of P-40 and Spitfire, even this machine could not do that much. The Spit was a \\"very hard bone\\"... It carried a lot of machine guns, plus two 20 mm cannons and it was faster. The 202 was inferior in speed and armament\\".Benzi, Andrea (Interview with Luigi Gorrini). \\"Storia del XX Secolo N. 33.\\" Febbraio, C.D.L. Edizioni srl, 1998. On 2 January 1943, the whole 3° Stormo, now equipped with Macchi C.202s, took off to face two formations of Douglas DB.7 Boston and B-25 Mitchell, escorted by Spitfires and P-40s. In the ensuing dogfight, Gorrini shot down a R.A.F. Curtiss P-40E Kittyhawk, that fell west of Sirte.Manfredi 1978, p. 146. Then he damaged a Spitfire that was attacking another Macchi. Gorrini shot 880 bullets but his aircraft had been hit: there were 12 holes in his fuselage.Manfredi 1978, pp. 147-148. Nine days later, the whole 18° Gruppo was escorting C.200 fighter-bombers in action on British airfields in Uadi (or Wadi) Tamet area. Gorrini shot down a 92 RAF Squadron Spitfire and he damaged another from the squadron of the British ace Flying Officer Neville Duke,Hakan aviation page http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/italy_gorrini.htm shooting 688 12,7 mm bullets.Manfredi 1978, p. 146. His Gruppo was often tasked to strafe the advancing Allied columns or to escort German bombers. On 26 February 1943, in the morning, he took off from El Hamma, to escort, with other pilots of his Squadriglia, Stukas attacking Allied armoured forces in Ksar Ghilane (an oasis of southern Tunisia located on the eastern limit of the Grand Erg Oriental), then he strafed the enemy troops. In the afternoon, on Kebili, with tenente Melis and two other fellow pilots, he intercepted four Allied aircraft. Gorrini claimed a Hawker Hurricane IID, armed with 40mm Vickers cannons. Manfredi 1978, pp. 158-159. But this was last air battle in Africa. His irritating eye injury was worsening and he was grounded and subsequently, at the end of February, hospitalized in Sfax.Manfredi 1978, pp. 160-161. He returned to Italy in late March 1943.Massimello and Apostolo 2000, p. 78. Defence of Rome When he recovered, was posted as a flying instructor in 3° Gruppo C (Complementare), based on Venaria Reale airfield.Manfredi 1978, p. 163. Later Gorrini served as a ferry pilot to transfer captured French Dewoitine D.520 fighters from France to Italy, for Italian home defence. \\"I have collected several dozens Dewoitine from various French airfields and the Toulouse factory\\", he recalled later. \\"At the time, when we were still flying the Macchi C.200, it was a good, if not very good, machine. Compared to the Macchi 200, it was superior only in one point - its armament of the Hispano- Suiza HS 404 20mm cannon.\\"Neulen 2000, p. 67. Gorrini, who had, by February 1943 achieved four confirmed victories and one unconfirmed, was given, at the beginning of summer 1943,Neulen 2000, p. 70. one of the three Macchi C.205 \\"Veltro\\" assigned to the 3° Stormo as a special favour (the other two were allotted to the ace Tenente Franco Bordoni Bisleri and to Maresciallo Guido Fibbia). During Summer 1943, in defence of Italy, he claimed 11 enemy aircraft.Shores 1983, p. 92. Regia Aeronautica C.205V - Luigi Gorrini was the \\"Veltro\\" top scoring ace. Flying this outstanding dog-fighter, he destroyed 14 Allied aircraft and damaged six more - Here a C.205 with a North Africa dust filter On 19 July, during a single sortie west of Rome, Gorrini destroyed a four-engined Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber and a Lockheed P-38 Lightning (another P-38 was damaged). Next day, he claimed another P-38 destroyed and a P-38 damaged. On 25 July Benito Mussolini had been overthrown, but this had no decisive effect on the morale of the Regia Aeronautica. Gorrini recalled: \\"After 25 July, despite the arrest of Mussolini, the morale of my unit, 85a Squadriglia and my personal readiness for action remained high. Despite all the reverses that Italy had suffered by the time, our 3° Stormo was the only one still fully ready for combat: my section was detailed to defend Rome. The larger part of the Regia Aeronautica was uninterested in politic or parties, they were men infatuated with flying and determined to defend the land of their birth and to give their lives if necessary in the attempt to stop the bombing of Italian towns.\\"Neulen 2000, p. 73. On 13 August Gorrini claimed a B-24 off the coast at Ostia, in the Lazio region, but he was also shot down by defensive fire from the bomber, bailing out safely. He claimed a Spitfire on 26 August. The next day, the whole Stormo scrambled to intercept four-engine bombers, which were attacking Cerveteri, on Latium coast, in central Italy. Gorrini, still flying a Veltro, shot down two Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses and a Lockheed P-38 Lightning, in a single engagement (according to other sources, Gorrini claimed two B-24s). One wing of his C.205 was damaged after an overheating cannon muzzle exploded. After running out of gasoline, he glided back to his base for a powerless landing. On 29 August, he claimed two P-38s destroyed and two more damaged. P-38s flying in formation - Gorrini scored several kills against this two-engined fighter, during the Defence of Rome, in summer 1943. On 30 August Gorrini claimed another B-17 \\"Flying Fortress\\" over Frascati and the same day he was mentioned on Bollettino di Guerra: \\"Sergente Maggiore Luigi Gorrini da Alseno (Piacenza) of 3° Stormo Caccia has distinguished himself during the aerial battles of the 27th and 29th, during which he has shot down two four-engined bombers and a twin- engined fighter.\\" On 31 August 85a Squadriglia, with Gorrini in a C.205V, took off from Palidoro airfield (Rome) at 12.00, flying in the direction of Naples to engage enemy bombers. At 8,500 meters the Squadriglia clashed with escorting Spitfires with 85a claiming three Spitfires destroyed and five damaged during this combat. Gorrini shot down one Spitfire (his 15th air victory) and damaged a P-38, but his aircraft was badly hit by machine gun fire and he made a forced landing away from his airfield at 12.50. Gorrini was seriously wounded and hospitalised. He was out of the fighting when Italy surrendered to the Allies on 8 September 1943. During three years of combat service Gorrini was involved in 132 air battles, was credited with 15 confirmed air victories, was wounded twice, crash-landed and baled out once, was mentioned on dispatches several times, and was awarded two times. Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana Republic P-47 in formation: under ANR insignia, Gorrini claimed several P-47s before being shot down and wounded in a dogfight with Republic fighters. On 12 October 1943, the legendary Lt Col Ernesto Botto (who had lost a leg while serving as a fighter pilot in Spain, but had continued to fly operationally during 1940-43), the newly appointed Undersecretary of the New Republican Air Force, appealed over the radio for airmen to enlist, and Gorrini, together with 6,996 others, did not hesitate to rejoin in combat against the Anglo-American forces: > \\"After flying for three years side by side with the German pilots, on the > English Channel, in North Africa, Greece, Egypt, Tunisia and finally over my > own homeland, I had made friends with some of them, particularly from JG27… > I did not want to hang my coat in the wind, so to speak, and perhaps fire on > my German friends. Also, I wanted to protect the northern Italian towns from > indiscriminate bombing as much as possible.\\"Neulen 2000, pp. 76–77. On 23 December 1943 Gorrini joined the Italian Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana (ANR) where he was assigned to 1a Squadriglia, 1° Gruppo Caccia and continued to fly C.205 fighters. At this time this unit was under the command of \\"Ace\\" Capitano Adriano Visconti and based at Lagnasco airfield (Cuneo). On this day Gorrini flew in a C.205V at 10.15 and was declared fit for combat. On 30 January 1944,1 ° Gruppo was scrambled to face a formation of USAF bombers escorted by P-47s. The C.205s intercepted the enemy aircraft off Grado.Manfredi 1978, pp. 255-256. Gorrini hit one of the Thunderbolts that had attacked sottotenente Re, and shot it down. Then he damaged a B-24 and rushed to intercept American aircraft that had attacked his base in Campoformido. When he arrived, a P-47 was on the tail of a Bf 109 from JG 27, that had intercepted the USAF raid on the Italian air base. Gorrini hit the P-47 that crashed near the airfield.Manfredi 1978, pp. 256-257-258. On the following day, he claimed a P-38. A Fiat G.55 with ANR livery exhibited at the Museo storico dell'Aeronautica Militare di Vigna di Valle. Gorrini flew this outstanding dogfighter under ANR insigna. A B-17 was claimed on 11 March and another P-47 on 6 April thus reaching 19 victories. On 24 May 1944, sergente maggiore Gorrini achieved his last air victory. He took off with tenente Vittorio Satta, to intercept a formation of B-24 flying between Parma and Fidenza. The two A.N.R. pilots intercepted the American bombers and their escort on Colorno. They selected the two last Liberators and attacked them. Gorrini put his B-24 on fire after his first pass, but two escorting P-47 bounced his leader and shot him down, killing Lt Satta.Manfredi 1978, pp. 283-284. On the following day, Gorrini claimed a B-17 damaged. But on 15 June 1944, in the sky of Modena-Reggio, Gorrini fought his last air battle. He suddenly found himself surrounded by four P-47 Thunderbolts. In the ensuing dogfight, his fighter was hit and Gorrini was forced to bail-out. He waited to open the parachute until he was close to the ground, fearing to be strafed by the American pilots. However, the harness was too loose and, when he opened it, he suffered a violent jerk and lost consciousness. When he woke up, he was in an infirmary. After being hospitalized, he was sent on leave.Manfredi 1978, p. 288. During his time with the A.N.R. he flew in combat with the Macchi C.205V and Fiat G.55.Pesce, Giuseppe and Giovanni Massimello. Adriano Visconti Asso di guerra. Parma: Albertelli editore s.r.l., 1997. Wounded twice, he did not fly again during World War II. He summed up his career, with these words: \\"212 air combat, 24 solo air victories, 5 parachute jumps.\\" Postwar After the war Gorrini enlisted in the newly formed Italian Air Force (Aeronautica Militare Italiana) but, due to Allied opposition, he was kept in the rank of warrant-officer. His last unit was the 50° Stormo. He was promoted Tenente only when he retired. He died on November 8, 2014. Awards Gorrini has been awarded with a Medaglia d'oro al Valor Militare (in 1958), two of Bronzo, and German Iron Cross of First and Second Class. Gorrini is the only pilot who has served in the A.N.R. to be awarded with the Italian highest military award after the war for his accomplishments obtained before the Armistice of 8 September 1943.

He was born as Karel Lončar in Selo near Lukovica in Upper Carniola. After graduating from the State Gymnasium in Ljubljana, he studied history at the Charles University in Prague, graduating in 1904. In Prague, he joined the circle of young Slovene left-wing intellectuals that became influenced by the political and social thought of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, which included figures such as Anton Dermota and Josip Ferfolja. After returning to the Slovene Lands, he taught history at Ljubljana's First Gymnasium, briefly serving as its director. He later served as the director of the National Museum of Slovenia, and, from 1920, as head of the Slovene Society publishing house (Slovenska matica). Before World War One, he joined the Yugoslav Social Democratic Party, where he belonged to its right wing led by Albin Prepeluh. He left the party after it merged with the so-called Centrists in 1921, who supported Yugoslav centralism. In 1924, Lončar was among the co-founders of the Slovenian Labour Agrarian Republican Party, which in 1927 merged with the Independent Agrarian Party into the Slovenian Peasant Party, a Slovenian counterpart to the Croatian Peasant Party, with which it maintained strong ties.

White-nosed monkey of Benin. Cercopithecus petaurista. Plate from La Ménagerie du Muséum by Simon-Charles Miger. Simon-Charles Miger (Nemours, 19 February 1736 – Paris, 28 February 1828) was a French engraver, most notable for the plates he produced for La Ménagerie du Muséum national d'histoire naturelle by Lacépède, Saint-Hilaire and Cuvier. Life and work Son of a tanner who sent him to study in Paris, Miger took various jobs including teacher, tutor and secretary before discovering a passion for engraving. He apprenticed to Charles Nicolas Cochin, which employed him as a clerk, and attended the workshop of Johann Georg Wille. He developed into a portraitist, and then fell in love with a woman with whom he courted for four years until his situation finally allow her to marry him. In 1778, Miger was accredited by the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture, where he was admitted as a member in 1781. During the French Revolution, he argued alongside Jean-Michel Moreau and Adélaïde Labille-Guiard for the renovation of the statutes that were falling into disrepair. \\"The laws of the state, he says, are granted by the French people, those of the Academy shall be through all académicien people.\\" But these reform proposals were rendered obsolete by the abolition of Academies, decreed by the National Convention in 1795. In 1800, Miger is charged with Bernard Germain de Lacépède to engrave the planks of his work on the menagerie of the National Museum of Natural History. He then continues to handle the chisel and compose verses until the age of nearly 90 years. GalleriesMenagerie= Image:Miger - Camelus Dromedarius.jpgThe Dromedary. Camelus dromedarius.

From then until 1771, he regularly exhibited portraits in the Paris Salons. Voiriot was a friend of the architect Michel-Barthélemy Hazon; they had travelled to Rome together. Through him he made contacts in Normandy that led to a number of portraits. From 1770, he was an associate of the Academy of Arts in Rouen. After 1771, he exhibited less often, concentrating on administrative tasks while continuing to paint family members, scientists, writers, actors and musicians. He died in Paris.

DirSync Pro is based on the program Directory Synchronize (DirSync), which was first released in February 2003 by Elias Gerber. He subsequently developed it with Frank Gerbig and T. Groetzner. DirSync Pro was released by O. Givi in July 2008, based on a branch of the DirSync code. Many parts of DirSync Pro have gone through major rewriting and redesign ever since. DirSync Pro offers a graphical user interface from which the user can manage and run multiple synchronization tasks. As of version 1.31, it supports local folder to folder synchronization, but does not support synchronization via FTP yet. The application is self-contained within its own directory, and is therefore fully portable. DirSync Pro makes it possible to compare a couple of directories and synchronize their content. It can be used to create incremental backups. The synchronization can be set up to mirror a directory into another one unidirectionally, or to synchronize the content of two directories bidirectionally. Before synchronization, the user can run an analysis on the source and destination. DirSync Pro detects any kind of changes to any file/directory in the source (e.g. file/directory modification, move, deletion, renaming) and can synchronize the destination accordingly. Features DirSync Pro provides the following predefined synchronization modes: * Synchronize A -> B (incremental): This mode makes a shadow of directory A in B. Only new and modified files are copied from A to B. * Synchronize B -> A (incremental): This mode makes a shadow of directory B in A. Only new and modified files are copied from B to A. * Synchronize A <-> B (incremental): This mode mirrors directories A and B to each other. Only new and modified files are copied. * Synchronize A <-> B (custom): This is a custom mode to mirror directories A and B to each other in which all advanced options could be set up to the user's need. * Backup A -> B (full): This mode makes a full copy of directory A into directory B. All files are copied. * Restore B -> A (full): This mode makes a full copy of directory B into directory A. All files are copied. * Contribute A -> B: This mode copies only the new files from directory A into directory B. Modified files are left away. * Contribute B -> A: This mode copies only the new files from directory B into directory A. Modified files are left away. * Synchronize A -> B (custom): This is a custom mode to synchronize directory A into directory B mode in which all advanced options could be set up to the user's need. * Synchronize B -> A (custom): This is a custom mode to synchronize directory B into directory A mode in which all advanced options could be set up to the user's need. When synchronizing bi-directionally, DirSync Pro detects synchronization conflicts. These conflicts may occur if a file is edited in both directories independently. DirSync Pro offers these options to solve the bi-directional synchronization conflict: * Copy the latest modified file to both directories. * Copy the largest modified file to both directories. * Rename and copy both files to both directories. * Do nothing and warn the user so he decides himself. When synchronizing mono-directionally in a custom mode, DirSync Pro detects synchronization conflicts. These conflicts may occur if a file is edited in the destination directory independently. DirSync Pro offers these options to solve the mono-directional synchronization conflicts: * Overwrite the file in the destination with the file from the source * Do nothing and warn the user so he decides himself * Do nothing and ignore the conflict. DirSync Pro lets the user configure unlimited number of filters to include or exclude files and directories. The user can set up a combination of unlimited number of filters of the following types: * Filter based on string patterns in file/directory names. * Filter based on file sizes. (smaller than, equal, larger than). * Filter based on modification dates (earlier than, on a date, later than). * Filter based on an absolute path. * Filter based on DOS attributes (DOS/MS Windows only). * Filter based on file ownerships (user and group, POSIX only). * Filter based on file permissions (POSIX systems only). DirSync Pro has a schedule engine with many options to schedule synchronization tasks, e.g. every minute, hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly. DirSync Pro has many logging facilities to create detailed logs per job, per jobset, or globally. DirSync Pro preserves (synchronizes) DOS file attributes, POSIX file permissions and ownerships and supports symbolic links. Reception Linux.com rated the utility positively, saying that \\"it makes defining a bidirectional sync as simple as picking two directories\\". Likewise, freshmeat calls it a \\"powerful, easy-to-configure tool to synchronize the contents of one directory with another\\".

S. Bristowe in 1939. They are non-web building predators that forage on the ground and on tree trunks at night, mainly in xerothermic forests. During the day, they hide in silk retreats they build under rocks or bark. H. sadistica was found to use traumatic insemination, the arthropod behavior of directly inserting its sperm into the body cavity of females. It is the first time it has ever been observed in spiders. H. hombergi is the only member of its genus that occurs in Great Britain. Description Like all woodlouse hunters, Harpactea have six eyes.

Shikari Shambu is one of the characters of Tinkle. Shambu is a cowardly and lazy shikari (hunter) whom the rest of the world perceives as courageous. He always tries to run away from dangerous animals, but due to some stroke of luck always ends up as a hero. He lives with his wife Shanti. In The Legend of Shikari Shambu (Tinkle Magazine No.573), it was revealed that Shambu, before being called \\"Shikari\\" Shambu, fell on a tiger and knocked him out. It was after this incident that he got the name \\"Shikari\\" Shambu. He is shown wearing a large pith helmet that completely covers his face and green shorts and a shirt. He carries a large rifle which he never uses.  Origins  By 1988, Tinkle was already on its way becoming the most popular children’s magazine in India. Their biggest rival that time was another children magazine named Target, run by Living Media. Unlike Tinkle, Target was more of a narrative magazine, with a few pages of comics. Their flagship character that time was Detective Moochhwala (Hindi for \\"the man with a mustache\\") by Ajit Ninan. Moochhwala who was a detective with penetrating eyes and a huge mustache. Tinkle decided to create a competing character. Subba Rao and Dhruva, two of the creators at Tinkle, came up with the proposal for such a character. They decided to base this new character on a boastful but cowardly big game hunter in the then famous television drama, I Love Lucy. Luis Fernandes then worked on producing the first story, which was originally named \\"Shambu\\", before Shahid Hidayat prefixed Shikari (Hindustani for \\"hunter\\") to the name. Some of his editorial teammates had reservation over the use of the name Shikari, as the wildlife conservation theme was in its prominence. But, the sheer charisma of the name, they and the editor Anant Pai, decided to let it continue. But, contrary to the name, the creators ensured that Shambu never would shoot or kill any animal in any of its episodes. More than that, creators slowly even disassociated him from his trademark hunting gun, after few episodes. The \\"non-violence\\" policy of Tinkle also resulted in Shambu being portrayed as more of an explorer than a hunter. One of the reasons for the popularity of Shikari Shambu, was due to the comical illustrations of the artist, Vasant Halbe. Halbe, who was a freelancer at Tinkle that time, had impressed the editorial team with his earlier works. Once he was confirmed officially as the artist for the series, he showcased his character sketches, of which a drawing of Shikari with his Topi (hat) pulled down over his eyes, caught everyone’s attention. The sketch went on to be the among the flagship character of Tinkle. In 1997, Savio A. Mascarenhas replaced Halbe as the illustrator.  As Little Shambu  Later, during the 434th issue of Tinkle, the childhood version of Shambu also known as Little Shambu appeared. It was a brainwave of Reena Ittyerah Puri, the former Associate Editor of Tinkle and now, Editor, Amar Chitra Katha. The characters of Little Shambu are- 1\\\\. Little Shambu- The childhood version of Shikari Shambu. 2\\\\. Little Shanti- The childhood version of Shanti, Shambu's Wife. 3\\\\. Little J.J.- The childhood version of Jeeva Jeevantak, an old arch-rival of Shambu who wants to harass him. 4\\\\. Dum Dum- The pet of Little Shambu, who doesn't appears in the main comic series, Shikari Shambu. 5\\\\. Kittu- The pet of Little Shanti. She doesn't appears in Shikari Shambu comic series and always harassed by J.J. 6\\\\. Suhasini- She is Little Shambu's mother. Although, her name was not revealed but revealed in a story named Nibble Nibble, which is the 3rd Little Shambu story. 7\\\\. Shambu's Father- (The name has not revealed) He is the father of Little Shambu and he always scolded him and even tried to leave him wherever the Shambu household went on such occasions. The reoccurring characters of Little Shambu are Manu Kaka, Panda Thieves, The teacher, The School Watchman, Prof. Y. Russ, Lakshmi, the Temple Elephant, Kondiah, etc. References Category:Indian comics Category:Comics characters introduced in 1983 ","title":"Shikari Shambu"},{"id":"22773375","text":"Lieutenant-General James Caulfeild (30 January 1782 – 4 November 1852) was an Irish soldier and political officer in British India, and a Liberal party politician.

He is a left-hand batsman and left-arm medium bowler. He made his début in the New Zealand State Championship on March 2009, and with a century, became the first débutante number nine batsman to score a hundred. CareerEarly life= Born in September 1987 in Christchurch, Canterbury, McCone grew up as a batsman, attended Cathedral Grammar School in Canterbury, where he scored 102* aged 12 or 13. When he reached the age of 16 he became a bowler, as he reached St. Andrew's School and their First XI cricket team. He also played for Lancaster Park-Woolston Cricket Club, batting at number three as well as at seven, eight or nine, and was also the club's leading wicket taker prior to his selection for Canterbury. =Selection= McCone was selected for Canterbury to play against England during the tour match of 2 February 2008, at Village Green, Christchurch. He bowled five wicket-less overs for 30, and scored two not out while batting at 11. He then played several matches for Canterbury's Second XI from 21 to 26 January 2009, including one performance of 2/36 against Otago's Second XI. When McCone was 21 he was selected for their home State Championship match against Otago on 28 March 2009. Following a top order collapse, McCone, batting at number nine, score 102 runs from 214 in the first innings to help build – with the aid of a 105 knock from Kruger van Wyk – Canterbury's first innings total of 315. McCone scored his first 50 runs from 128 balls, and reached 100 from 168 balls just before the close of play. McCone then bowled ten wicketless overs for 33 as Otago were dismissed for 320. Canterbury reached 233/4 in reply before the match was drawn with no play on the final day due to rain. McCone's century was the first ever on debut for a New Zealand number nine in first-class cricket. McCone returned for the 2009/10 season in a match against Central Districts on 3 December, and bowled 22 overs for his first wicket, returning 1/79. He scored 16 and 13 in Canterbury's two innings before Central Districts chased down 27 runs for a ten-wicket win. He played two more matches in the season, ending with 60 runs at 12.00, and five wickets at 67.20. In June 2018, he was awarded a contract with Central Districts for the 2018–19 season.

Horticulturally it is known as the Jamaica(n) rain tree. Key features The Jamaican rain tree is a small drought-resistant tree that can grow around 20–30 feet tall and produces long, drooping branches. It has small, waxy 2-3 parted compound leaves that often appear to be simple. The leaves are densely borne in alternate formation on short spurs that are produced on the main stems. The bright yellow flowers develop on short indeterminate (racemose) inflorescences. They are typically (for the subfamily Faboideae) pea-like and hermaphroditic, with bilateral symmetry and (not so typically) heterostyly. The fruits are legumes, which are common for the family Fabaceae. Ecology B. ebenus grows in scrublands (tropical terrestrial biome), needs full sunlight and flowers sporadically throughout the year. As its common name suggests, the Jamaican rain tree is well known to come into bloom almost immediately after a rain event. This is may be an adaptation to produce seeds quickly when unpredictable rains occur. The flowers attract insect visitors such as bees. As in many Faboideae, the Jamaican rain tree has bacterial nodules in its roots, which fix atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form, allowing growth in poor soils. Biogeography There are four rare Caribbean species of Fabaceae (Faboideae) that were described by Lewis (1988). They are Behaimia cubensis, Belairia mucronata, Herpyza grandiflora & Brya ebenus. Of these four species, Brya ebenus is the only species that is not endemic to Cuba. Cultivation and uses B. ebenus is cultivated as an ornamental, for bonsai trees, and for its valuable wood. Cocus wood is a very dense tropical hardwood with excellent musical tone quality, and was used for making flutes in England and France especially during the 19th century. It is still occasionally used for wooden musical instruments such as bagpipes, clarinets, oboes, and piccolos.

Biography He was a member of a very old French nobility family from Gascony. His kinsman Anne-Pierre, marquis de Montesquiou-Fézensac would serve alongside him in the National Assembly. Montesquiou-Fézensac was named (1782) Abbé of Beaulieu, near Langres. The Abbé de Montesquieu attended the Assembly of the French clergy (1785) as Agent-General. French Revolution The Abbé was elected by the First Estate of Paris to the Estates General of 1789. He would stand out alongside the Abbé Maury by his oratory, and was elected president of the National Assembly three times. He presided over the Assembly an impressive three terms (4–18 January 1790; 28 February - 15 March 1790; 14–30 March 1791). He opposed strongly the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and supported the monarchy. He was forced to flee to England after the Storming of the Tuileries (10 August 1792). He lived in the United States 1792-1795 during the Reign of Terror. Restoration He returned to France after 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794) and immediately took up the royalist cause as one of the agents of Louis XVIII. He became a member of the Royalist Committee in Paris, and for his activism he was once exiled to Menton. Under the First Restoration he was appointed Minister of the Interior ( 13 May 1814 - 19 March 1815 ). In his brief term he appointed Pierre-Paul Royer-Collard and director of the library François Guizot secretary general. The Second Restoration, he had the title of Minister of State. Elected deputy by the department of Gers, he opted for the Chamber of Peers with the title of Count (as of 31 August 1817) and Duke (as of 30 April 1821). He resigned his peerage 9 January 1832, shortly before his death. He was appointed member of the Académie française by royal decree of 21 March 1816 . He was also elected member of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres on 12 August 1816. He left manuscripts on the history of Louis XV and Louis XVI and a travel journal for the U.S. and Canada but did nothing to have them published.  External links  * William L.

He travelled to Canada and the United States between 1795 and 1802 to escape the French Revolution, making friends with Thomas Jefferson and teaching French to Lemuel Shaw. From 1803 to 1809, he was tutor to the sons of Joseph Fouché, before serving as a civil servant in the Ministry of Police, where he translated English newspapers. He contributed to the Journal des Voyages and L'Abeille, participated in the foundation of Constitutionnel and La Minerve française, and edited the Journal de Paris. He was an influential opposition journalist, who had supported the French Revolution and First French Empire (serving as a deputy in the Chambre of the Hundred Days and favouring the handover of Napoleon to the Allies after Waterloo), opposing the Bourbon Restoration and finally seeing the triumph of his political ideal in the July Revolution. He was mayor of Lagorce (1830–1848), conseiller général for the Gironde (1831–1837) and deputy for the Gironde (1815, 1831, 1834).

For fixed charge Q, the mass sum of Q free particles exceeds the energy (mass) of the NTS so that the latter is energetically favorable to exist. The interior region of an NTS is occupied by vacuum different from the ambient vacuum. The vacuums are separated by the surface of the NTS representing a domain wall configuration (topological defect), which also appears in field theories with broken discrete symmetry. Infinite domain walls contradict cosmology, but the surface of an NTS is closed and finite, so its existence would not be contradictory. If the topological domain wall is closed, it shrinks because of wall tension; however, due to the structure of the NTS surface, it does not shrink since the decrease of the NTS volume would increase its energy. Introduction Quantum field theory has been developed to describe the elementary particles. However, in the mid 1970s it was found out that this theory predicts one more class of stable compact objects: non- topological solitons (NTS). The NTS represents an unusual coherent state of matter, called also bulk matter. Models were suggested for the NTS to exist in forms of stars, quasars, the dark matter and nuclear matter. A NTS configuration is the lowest energy solution of classical equations of motion possessing a spherical symmetry. Such a solution has been found for a rich variety of field Lagrangians. One can associate the conserved charge with global, local, Abelian and non-Abelian symmetry. It appears to be possible the NTS configuration with bosons as well as with fermions to exist. In different models either one and the same field carries the charge and binds the NTS, or there are two different fields: charge carrier and binding field. Typical energy vs radius dependence for an NTS star The spatial size of the NTS configuration may be elementary small or astronomically large: depending on a model, i.e. the model fields and constants. The NTS size could increase with its energy until the gravitation complicates its behavior and finally causes the collapse. Although in some models the NTS charge is bounded by the stability (or metastability) condition. Simple examplesOne field= For a complex scalar field with the U(1) invariant Lagrange density : \\\\mathcal L=\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\Phi^2-U(\\\\Phi) \\\\, the NTS is a ball with radius R filled with the field \\\\Phi=(\\\\phi_0/\\\\sqrt{2})e^{i\\\\omega t} . Here \\\\phi_0 is a constant inside the ball except for a thin surface coat where it sharply drops to the global U(1) symmetrical minimum of U(\\\\Phi). The value \\\\phi_0 is adjusted so that it minimises the energy of the configuration : E=\\\\Big( \\\\frac{\\\\phi_0^2\\\\omega^2}{2}+U(\\\\frac{\\\\phi_0}{\\\\sqrt{2}})\\\\Big) \\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi R^3.\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,(1) Since the U(1) symmetry gives the conserved current j_\\\\mu=-i(\\\\Phi^*\\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\Phi-\\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\Phi^*\\\\Phi), \\\\, the ball possesses the conserved charge : Q=\\\\int j_0 d^3x = \\\\omega\\\\varphi_0^2\\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi R^3. The minimization of the energy (1) with R gives : E=Q\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2U(\\\\varphi_0/\\\\sqrt{2})}{\\\\phi_0^2}}. \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,(2) The charge conservation allows the decay of the ball into Q particles exactly. This decay is energetically unprofitable if the sum mass Qm exceed the energy (2). Therefore, for the NTS existence it is necessary to have : \\\\frac{2U(\\\\varphi_0/\\\\sqrt{2})}{\\\\varphi_0^2} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{U(\\\\Phi)}{\\\\Phi^2}\\\\Bigg_\\\\min < m^2. The thin wall approximation, which was used above, allows to omit the gradient term E_\\\\text{surface} in the expression for energy (1), since E_\\\\text{surface}\\\\sim U(\\\\varphi_0/\\\\sqrt{2})R^2\\\\Delta R\\\\ll U(\\\\varphi_0/\\\\sqrt{2})R^3. This approximation is valid for Q\\\\gg 1 and is justified by the exact solution of the motion equation. =Two fields= The non-topological soliton configuration for a couple of interacting fields The NTS configuration for a couple of interacting scalar fields is sketched here. The Lagrange density : \\\\mathcal L=\\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\Phi^2+\\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\sigma)^2-g\\\\Phi^2\\\\sigma^2-\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{4}(\\\\sigma^2-\\\\sigma_0^2)^2 is invariant under U(1) transformation of the complex scalar field \\\\Phi. Let this field depends on time and coordinate simply as \\\\Phi(\\\\vec {r},t) =(\\\\phi(r)/\\\\sqrt{2})e^{i\\\\omega t}. It carries the conserved charge Q=4\\\\pi\\\\omega\\\\int\\\\limits_{0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\phi^2(r)r^2dr. In order to check that the energy of the configuration is smaller than Qm, one should either to calculate this energy numerically or to use the variational method. For trial functions \\\\phi(r)=\\\\varphi_0(\\\\sin\\\\omega r/r) and \\\\sigma(r)=0 for r < R, : \\\\phi(r)=0\\\\text{ and }\\\\sigma(r)=\\\\sigma_0\\\\Big( 1-\\\\exp(-(r-R)/l)\\\\Big)\\\\text{ for }r > R, \\\\, the energy in the large Q limit is approximately equal to E\\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\pi Q}{R}+\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{3}\\\\lambda\\\\sigma_0^4 R^3.

Q can't exceed N due to the Pauli exclusive principle if the fermions are in the coherent state. This time the NTS energy E is bound by : E_\\\\text{up}=\\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{2}U^{1/4} \\\\left(-\\\\frac{m}{g}\\\\right)N^{3/4}, See Friedberg/Lee. StabilityClassical stability= The condition E(Q) only allows to assert the NTS stability against a decay into free particles. The equation of motion gives E(Q) only on a classical level. At least two things should be taken into account: (i) the decay into smaller pieces (fission) and (ii) the quantum correction for E(Q) . Energy vs charge dependence ensuring the NTS stability against fission The condition of stability against the fission looks as follows: : \\\\frac{d^2E(Q)}{dQ^2}<0 .\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,(4) It signifies that E(Q_1)+E(Q_2)>E(Q_1 + Q_2) . This condition is satisfied for the NTS in examples 2.2 and 2.3. The NTS in example 2.1, called also Q-ball, is stable against the fission as well, even though the energy (2) does not satisfy (4): one has to recollect the omitted gradient surface energy and to add it to the Q-ball energy (1). Perturbatively, E_\\\\text{surface}\\\\propto R^2(Q)\\\\propto Q^{2/3}. Thus : \\\\frac{d^2(E_\\\\text{surface}+Q\\\\sqrt{2U(\\\\phi_0/\\\\sqrt{2})/\\\\phi_0^2})}{dQ^2}<0\\\\. Another job E_\\\\text{surface} does, is to set Q_\\\\min for the thin-wall description of Q-ball: for small Q the surface becomes thicker, E_\\\\text{surface} grows and kills the energy gain Q(m-\\\\sqrt{U(\\\\Phi)/\\\\Phi^2}\\\\Big _\\\\min) . However the formalism for the thick-wall approximation has been developed by KusenkoA. Kusenko, CERN- Th/97-69, hep-th/9704073 who says that for small Q, NTS also exists. =Quantum correction= As for quantum correction, it also diminishes the binding energy per charge m-E(Q)/Q for small NTS, making them unstable. The small NTS are especially important for the fermion case, since it is naturally to expect rather small number of fermions species N in (3), and consequently, Q. For Q=2 the quantum correction decreases the binding energy by 23%. For Q=1 a calculation based on the path integral method has been carried out by Baacke.J. Baacke, DO-TH/90-5. The quantum energy has been derived as a time derivative of the one-loop fermion effective action : S_{\\\\text{eff}}=-i\\\\ln \\\\det\\\\Big(\\\\frac{i\\\\gamma^{\\\\mu}{\\\\partial}_{\\\\mu}- g\\\\sigma(x)}{i\\\\gamma^{\\\\mu}{\\\\partial}_{\\\\mu}-g\\\\sigma_0}\\\\Big). This calculation gives the loop energy of the order of binding energy. In order to find the quantum correction following the canonical method of quantization, one has to solve the Schrödinger equation for the Hamiltonian built with quantum expansion of field functions. For the boson field NTS it reads : \\\\Phi=1/\\\\sqrt{2}(\\\\phi_{cl}(\\\\vec{r}-\\\\vec{R(t)})+\\\\sum_n q_n(t)\\\\beta(\\\\vec{r}))e^{i \\\\zeta(t)}, \\\\sigma=\\\\sigma_{cl}(\\\\vec{r}-\\\\vec{R(t)})+\\\\sum_n q_n(t)\\\\alpha(\\\\vec{r}). Here \\\\phi_{cl}\\\\, and \\\\sigma_{cl} are the solutions of the classical equation of motion, \\\\vec{R(t)} represents motion of the mass center, \\\\zeta(t) is the over-all phase, q_{n}, n=5,6,\\\\dots,\\\\infty are the vibration coordinates, by analogy with the oscillator decomposition of photon field : A^\\\\mu= \\\\sum_k a_k^\\\\mu(t)e^{i\\\\vec k\\\\vec r} +c.c. For this calculation the smallness of four-interaction constant is essential, since the Hamiltonian is taken in the lowest order of that constant. The quantum decreasing of the binding energy increases the minimal charge Q_\\\\min making the NTS metastable between old and new values of this charge. Energy vs charge dependence with non-gravitational upper limit for the NTS charge NTSs in some models become unstable as Q exceeds some stable charge Q_\\\\max:E(Q>Q_\\\\max)>Qm. For example, NTS with fermions carrying a gauge charge has E(Q)\\\\propto (C_1Q^{4/3}+C_2Q^2)^{2/3} exceeding Qm for Q large enough as well as for small one. Besides, the gauged NTS probably is unstable against a classical decay without conservation of its charge due to complicated vacuum structure of the theory.G. G. Petriashvilly, Yad. Phys. 50 (1989) 573. Generally, the NTS charge is limited by the gravitational collapse: E(Q)/M_{Pl}^2R(Q)<1. =Particle emission= If one adds to the Q-ball Lagrange density an interaction with massless fermion \\\\Psi : \\\\mathcal L_{\\\\Psi}+\\\\mathcal L_{\\\\Psi\\\\Phi}=\\\\Psi^+(i\\\\partial_0+i\\\\vec{\\\\partial}\\\\vec{\\\\sigma})\\\\Psi- ig\\\\Phi\\\\Psi^+\\\\sigma_2\\\\Psi^*+ ig\\\\Phi^*\\\\Psi^T\\\\sigma_2\\\\Psi which is also U(1) invariant assuming the global charge for boson twice as for fermion, Q-ball once created begins to emit its charge with \\\\Psi-pairs, predominantly from its surface. The evaporation rate per unit area dN/dtdS<\\\\Big(U(\\\\Phi)/\\\\Phi^2\\\\Big_\\\\min\\\\Big)^{3/2}/192\\\\pi^2. The ball of trapped right-handed Majorana neutrinos in SU(2)_L SU(2)_R symmetric electroweak theory loses its charge (the number of trapped particles) through the neutrino-antineutrino annihilation by emitting photons from the whole volume.A. D. Dolgov, O. Yu. Markin, Sov. Phys. JETP 71 (1990) 207. The third example for a NTS metastable due to particle emission is the gauged non- Abelian NTS. The massive (outside the NTS) member of fermionic multiplet decays into a massless one and a gauged boson also massless in the NTS. Then the massless fermion carries away the charge since it does not interact at all with the Higgs field. Three last examples represent a class for NTS metastable due to emission of particles which do not participate in the NTS construction. One more similar example: because of the Dirac mass term m(\\\\overline\\\\Psi_R\\\\Psi_L + \\\\overline\\\\Psi_L\\\\Psi_R) , right-handed neutrinos convert to left-handed ones. That happens at the surface of neutrino ball mentioned above. Left-handed neutrinos are very heavy inside the ball and they are massless outside it. So they go away carrying the energy and diminishing the number of particles inside. This \\"leakage\\" appears to be much slower than the annihilation onto photons.A. E. Everett, Phys. Rev. D 10 (1974) 3126. Soliton-starsQ-star= The gravitation upper limit for the boson field Q-star energy As the charge Q grows and E(Q) the order of M^2_{Pl}R(Q), the gravitation becomes important for NTS. A proper name for such an object is a star. A boson-field Q-star looks like a big Q-ball. The way gravity changes E(Q) dependence is sketched here. It is the gravity what makes d^2E(Q)/dQ^2<0 for Q-star — stabilize it against the fission. Q-star with fermions has been described by Bahcall/Selipsky. Similar the NTS of Friedberg & Lee, the fermion field carrying a global conserved charge, interacts with a real scalar field. : \\\\mathcal L=\\\\frac{i}{2}\\\\overleftrightarrow{\\\\overline\\\\Psi\\\\gamma^\\\\mu\\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\Psi} - m(\\\\sigma)\\\\overline\\\\Psi\\\\Psi-U(\\\\sigma)+\\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\sigma)^2. The \\\\sigma inside Q-star moves from a global maximum of the potential changing the mass of fermions and making them bound. But this time Q is not the number of different fermion species but it is the large number of one and the same kind particles in the Fermi gas state. Then for the fermion field description one has to use k_F(r) instead of \\\\Psi(r) and the condition of pressure equilibrium instead of the Dirac equation for \\\\Psi(r). Another unknown function is the scalar field \\\\sigma(r) profile which obeys the following motion equation : {\\\\vec\\\\partial}^2\\\\sigma - (dm(\\\\sigma)/d\\\\sigma)\\\\langle\\\\overline\\\\Psi\\\\Psi\\\\rangle - dU(\\\\sigma)/d\\\\sigma=0. Here\\\\langle\\\\overline\\\\Psi\\\\Psi\\\\rangle is the scalar density of fermions, averaged on statistical ensemble: : \\\\langle\\\\overline\\\\Psi\\\\Psi\\\\rangle=\\\\int\\\\frac{m}{(k^2+m^2)^{1/2}}\\\\frac{2d^3k}{(2\\\\pi)^3},\\\\quad 0 Fermi energy of the fermion gas \\\\varepsilon_F=(k^2_F+m^2)^{1/2}. Neglecting the derivatives of \\\\sigma(r) for large Q, that equation together with the pressure equilibrium equation P_f-U=0, constitute a simple system which gives k_F and \\\\sigma inside the NTS. They are constant since we have neglected the derivatives. The fermion pressure : P_f=\\\\int\\\\frac{k^2}{3(k^2+m^2)^{1/2}}\\\\frac{2d^3k}{(2\\\\pi)^3},\\\\quad 0 For example, if m(\\\\sigma)=g\\\\sigma and U(\\\\sigma)=\\\\lambda/4(\\\\sigma^2-\\\\sigma^2_0)^2, then \\\\sigma=0 and k_F=\\\\varepsilon_F=(3\\\\pi^2\\\\lambda)^{1/4}\\\\sigma_0. That means fermions appear to be massless in the NTS. Then the full fermion energy E_f=3P_f . For an NTS with the volume V and the charge Q=V(k^3_F/3\\\\pi^2), its energy is proportional to the charge: E(Q)=( U+E_f)V=\\\\varepsilon_FQ. The described above fermion Q-star has been considered as a model for neutron starS. Bahcall, B. W. Lynn, S. B. Selipsky, Preprint SU-ITP-866 (1989). in the effective hadron field theory. =Soliton star= If the scalar field potential U(\\\\sigma) has two degenerate or almost degenerate minima, one of them have to be the real (true) minimum in which we happen to leave. Inside NTS \\\\sigma occupies another one. In such a model non-zero vacuum energy appears only at the NTS surface, not in its volume. This allows for the NTS to be very big without falling in gravitational collapse. That is the case in the left-right symmetric electroweak theory. For a scale of symmetry breaking about 1 TeV, u-ball of trapped right-handed massless neutrino might have the mass (energy) about 108 solar masses and was considered as a possible model for quasar. For the degenerate potential U(\\\\sigma)=\\\\mu^2\\\\sigma^2(1-\\\\sigma/\\\\sigma_0)^2/2 both boson and fermion soliton stars were investigated. A complex scalar field could alone form the state of gravitational equilibrium possessing the astronomically large conserved number of particles.J. J. Van der Bij, M. Gleiser, Preprint FERMILAB-Pub-87/41-A. Such objects are called minisoliton stars because of their microscopic size. Non-topological soliton with standard fields Could a system of the Higgs field and some fermion field of the Standard model be in the state of Friedberg & Lee NTS ? That is more possible for a heavy fermion field: for a such one the energy gain would be the most because it does lose its large mass in the NTS interior, were the Yukawa term g\\\\sigma\\\\overline\\\\Psi\\\\Psi vanishes due to \\\\sigma\\\\simeq0. The more so if the vacuum energy in the NTS interior U(0)=\\\\lambda\\\\sigma^4_0/4 is large, that would mean the large Higgs mass m_H=\\\\sigma_0\\\\sqrt{2\\\\lambda}. The large fermion mass implies strong Yukawa coupling g. Calculation showsS. Dimopoulos, B. W. Lynn, S. Selipsky, N. Tetradis, Preprint CERN-TH.5761/90. that the NTS solution is energetically favored over a plane wave (free particle) only if g>2.3 for even very small m_H. For m_H =350 GeV (this is the point were \\\\lambda=1 for experimentally known \\\\sigma_0=250 GeV) the coupling g must be more than five. The next question is whether or not multi-fermion NTS like a fermion Q-star is stable in the Standard model. If we restrict ourself by one fermion species, then the NTS has god the gauge charge. One can estimate the energy of gauged NTS as follows: : E=(4\\\\pi)^{1/3}(3/4)^{5/3}Q^{4/3}/R+\\\\beta e^2Q^2/R+(4\\\\pi R^3/3)\\\\lambda\\\\sigma^4_0/4. Here R and Q are its radius and charge, the first term is the kinetic energy of the fermi-gas, the second is the Coulomb energy, \\\\beta takes into account the charge distribution inside the NTS and the latest one gives the volume vacuum energy. Minimization with R gives the NTS energy as a function of its charge: : E(Q)=4\\\\sigma_0(\\\\pi\\\\lambda)^{1/4}/3\\\\left((4\\\\pi)^{1/3}(3/4)^{5/3}Q^{4/3}+\\\\beta e^2Q^2\\\\right)^{3/4}. An NTS is stable if E(Q) is smaller than the sum of masses for Q particles at infinite distance each from other. That is case for some Q, but such a E(Q) dependence allows the fission for any Q. Why could not quarks be bound in a hadron like in NTS. Friedberg and Lee investigated such a possibility. They assumed quarks getting huge masses from their interaction with a scalar field \\\\sigma. Thus free quarks are heavy and escape from detection. The NTS built with quarks and \\\\sigma fields demonstrate static properties of hadrons with 15% accuracy. That model demands SU(3) symmetry additional to the color one in order to preserve the later unbroken so that QCD gluons get large masses by SU(3) symmetry breaking outside hadrons and also avoid detection. Nuclei have been considered as NTS's in the effective theory of strong interaction which is easier to deal with than QCD.D. A. Hochron, Preprint CERN-TH-5991/91. SolitonogenesisTrapped particles= The way NTS's could be born by depends on whether or not the Universe carries a net charge. If it does not then NTS could be formed from random fluctuations of the charge. Those fluctuations grow up, disturb the vacuum and create NTS configurations. If the net charge is present, i.e. charge asymmetry exists with a parameter \\\\eta=( n_\\\\Phi-n_{\\\\overline\\\\Phi})/ (n_\\\\Phi+n_{\\\\overline\\\\Phi}), NTS could be simply born as the space became divided onto finite regions of true and false vacuum during the phase transition in the early Universe. Those occupied by the NTS (false) vacuum are almost ready NTSs. The scenario of the region formation depends on the phase transition order. Field potential during the first order phase transition If the first order phase transition occurs, then nucleating bubbles of true vacuum grow and percolate, shrinking regions filled with the false vacuum. The later are preferable for charged particles to live in due to their smaller masses, so those regions become NTSs. Field potential during the second order phase transition In case of the second order phase transition as temperature drops below the crucial value T_c the space consist of interconnecting regions of both false and true vacua with characteristic size \\\\xi\\\\propto T^{-1}_c. This interconnection \\"freezes out\\" as its rate becomes smaller than the expansion rate of the Universe at Ginzburg temperature T_G, then the regions of two vacua percolate. But if the false vacuum energy is large enough, \\\\Lambda>0.8U_M on the plot, the false vacuum forms finite clusters (NTS's) surrounded by the percolated true vacuum. The trapped charge stabilizes clusters against collapse. Field potential with biased discrete symmetry In the second scenario of the NTS formation the number of born Q-charged NTS's per unit volume is simply the number density of clusters holding Q particles. Their number density is given by n(r)= br^{-3/2}\\\\exp{(-cr)}/V_\\\\xi, here b and c are constants of the order of unit, r\\\\simeq (L/2\\\\xi)^3 is the number of correlation volumes V_\\\\xi in a cluster of size L. The number of particle in a cluster is Q(r)\\\\simeq rV_\\\\xi\\\\eta n_Q, here n_Q is the charge density in the universe at Ginzburg temperature. Thus big clusters are born very rarely and if the minimum stable charge Q_\\\\min is present, then overwhelming majority of born NTS carries Q_\\\\min. For the following Lagrange density with biased discrete symmetry : \\\\mathcal L=\\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\Phi^2+(\\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\sigma)^2/2- \\\\lambda_1(\\\\sigma^2-\\\\sigma_0^2)^2/8-\\\\lambda_2(\\\\sigma-\\\\sigma_0)^3\\\\sigma_0/3- h\\\\Phi^2(\\\\sigma-\\\\sigma_0)^2-g\\\\Phi^4-\\\\Lambda with : \\\\lambda_1/\\\\lambda_2 =0.15,\\\\, : \\\\Lambda=0.6 \\\\lambda_1\\\\sigma_0^4 and \\\\xi=1/\\\\lambda_1T_G, it appears to be Q_\\\\min = 18\\\\lambda_1/h^2 and : n(Q_\\\\min)\\\\propto(\\\\eta/\\\\lambda_1Q_\\\\min)^{3/2}\\\\exp{(-c Q_\\\\min\\\\lambda_1^3/\\\\eta)}. =Field condensate= The net charge could be also placed in the complex scalar field condensate \\\\langle \\\\Phi\\\\rangle instead of free particles. This condensate could consist of spatially homogeneous \\\\Phi=f(t)\\\\exp{(i\\\\theta (t))}/\\\\sqrt 2 and \\\\Phi^2=f^2(t)/2 provides its potential to be at minimum as the universe cools down and the temperature correction changes the form of the potential. Such a model was treated to explain the baryon asymmetry.S. Dodelson, L. M. Widrow, Phys. Rev. Lett. 41(1990)340. If the field potential allows Q-ball to exist, then they could be born from this condensate as the charge volume density j_0=f^2\\\\partial_0\\\\theta(t) drops in course of the universe expansion and becomes equal to Q-balls charge density.K. M. Benson, L. M. Widrow, Preprint HUTP-90/A054. As follows from the equation of motion for \\\\theta(t), this density j_0 changes with the expansion as the minus third power of scale factor a(t) for the expanding space-time with the differential length element ds^2=dt^2-a^2(t)(dx^2+dy^2+dz^2). Breaking the condensate onto Q-balls appears to be favorable over further dilution of the homogeneous charge density by expansion. The total charge in a comoving volume Q=\\\\int j_0a^3d^3x stays fixed of course. The condensation of \\\\Phi could occur at high temperature of the universe, due to the negative temperature correction to its mass: m(T)=m^2-\\\\lambda ^2/2 which provides with minimum its potential U(\\\\Phi)=m^2\\\\Phi^2-\\\\lambda\\\\Phi^4/2+\\\\gamma\\\\Phi^6. Here the last term is induced by the interaction h\\\\chi^2\\\\Phi^2 with additional field \\\\chi that has to be introduced in order to satisfy the Q-ball existence condition U(\\\\Phi)/\\\\Phi^2\\\\Big_\\\\min. At the temperature relevant to relevant Q-balls formation \\\\chi appears only through virtual process (loops) because it is heavy. An alternative way to satisfy the Q=ball existence condition is to appeal to the non-Abelian symmetry. Further evolution Once formed, the NTSs undergo complicated evolution, losing and acquiring the charge by interaction with each other and surrounding particles. Depending on theory parameters, they could either disappear at all or get statistical equilibrium and \\"freeze out\\" at some temperature of the universe, or be born \\"frozen out\\" if their interaction is slower than expansion rate at T_G. In the first and the second cases, their up-to-date abundance (if any) has nothing to do with that at the moment of formation. Since an NTS is a composite object, it has to demonstrate properties different from those of a single particle, e.g. evaporation emission, excitation levels, scattering form-factor. Cosmic observations of such phenomena could provide the unique information about the physics beyond the ability of accelerators.

It had a concrete runway. The facility was built by the Luftwaffe during World War II to provide air defense for Trondheim and as a temporary airport until Værnes Air Station was completed. After the end of the war in 1945 the airport was taken over by civilian authorities. Trøndelag Flyveselskap operated from Lade from 1946 to 1950. The airline folded and was replaced by Trønderfly, which lasted for one year. Widerøe then started operating at the airport and continued to do so until its closing, although they never operated scheduled services out of the airport. Aviation clubs at the airport were Trondheim Flyklubb and NTH Flyklubb. At first Trondheim was mostly served by water aerodromes and from 1952 Trondheim Airport, Værnes became Trondheim's main airport. Braathens SAFE operated scheduled flights to Oslo from 1952 to 1956, when they moved to Værnes. Lade Airport remained in use until 1965, when it was abandoned to allow for the area to be redeveloped for industry, shopping, and a sports venue. HistoryWorld War II= The site at Lade was traditionally farming land. During the late 19th century it was proposed used as a site for the Norwegian College of Agriculture, but was instead located at Ås. Thus the area remained an agricultural area at the break-out of World War II in 1940. A Norwegian Simmonds Spartan school aircraft landed at the fields.Hafstad: 59 Scheduled services to Trondheim started in 1937, when Norwegian Air Lines (DNL) started seaplane services out of the port at Ilsvika and the lake of Jonsvannet.Hovd: 306–308 During the German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940, German pilot Feldwebel Nowak conducted an emergency landing with his Junkers Ju 52 on the fields at Lade. He secured the area and later that day seven more aircraft landed in the fields.Hafsten: 21 Trondheim was a strategically important city as it hosted both a shipyard and a submarine pen, Dora 1,Hafsten: 317 in addition to its strategic location for German aircraft to operate northwards as the Norwegian Campaign continued in Northern Norway.Hafstad: 61 Værnes Air Station was in such a condition that it was unsuitable for the large German aircraft, such as the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. Thus the Luftwaffe chose to use both the fields at Lade and the ice on Jonsvannet while Værnes was being upgraded. In April 1940 the Wehrmacht demanded that 500 men be made available immediately to build the airport, and 2000 men within short time. If the local authorities were not able to follow up, the German military threatened to lock down the city and shoot anyone attempting to leave.Christiansen: 255 At Lade there was built a wooden runway, a partially wooden and partially concrete taxiway and some hangars. Later the runway was later rebuilt to concrete. The taxiways were often first built in wood and the later rebuilt to concrete. Aircraft stationed at Lade consisted for the most part of transporters and Stukas. In addition to serving as a stop-over for flights northwards, Lade was important for the defense of Trondheim and the submarine bases. This was organized as part of Jagdgruppe Drontheim of Jagdgeschwader 5 (JG5). The airport was bombed by the Royal Air Force's Beaufighters by the 248 and 235 Squadron in April 1942.Christiansen: 138 As of 1943 Lade stationed the staff of IV/JG5 with their twelve Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2 aircraft and a detachment of 10/JG5 of five Bf 109G-6s.Christiansen: 162 In an American attack of Dora on 24 July 1943, the winds caused the artificial smoke to cover Lade, but not Dora, allowing the Americans to see their target, but not allow the Germans to scramble their aircraft in defense.Hafstad: 63 In 1944 and 1945 Lade was the base of staff for JG5 and IV/Zerstörergeschwader 26, as well as Messerschmitt Bf 110G from the latter.Hafsten: 287 Transportgeschwader 5 had Ju 52s stationed at Lade during 1944.Hafsten: 255 =Civilian operations= With the German capitulation on 8 May 1945, the airport at first taken by Allied troops, who disarmed any German military equipment. The airport was subsequently taken over by Norwegian authorities. DNL resumed scheduled flights from Trondheim on 27 May 1946, serving Ilsvika with Ju 52 seaplanes with a stop-over on their Northern Norway route from Oslo Airport, Fornebu. Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen took in a letter to the editor in Adresseavisen in 1947 initiative to establishing a land airport in Trøndelag. The Bukken Bruse Accident which killed nineteen people were killed in a crash during landing at the water aerodrome at Hommelvik. However, DNL, and its successor Scandinavian Airlines System never chose to operate out of Lade. Instead they moved their flights to Trondheim Airport, Værnes from 1952.Hafstad: 64 Trøndelag Flygeselskap A/S was established by Anders Estenstad, Kjell Lefstad, Ola Lefstad and Thor Gjedebo in 1946, receiving an initial share capital of 50,000 Norwegian krone (NOK). The airline bought three aircraft, two three-seat Austers and a four-seat Republic Seabee. It has based in two of the German-built hangars. The company was engaged in air ambulance services, taxi flights, tourist flights and a pilot school.Hafstad: 66 The aviation activity caught on amongst the city population, resulting in two aviation clubs being established. Trondheim Flyklubb was founded in December 1947, while NTH Flyklubb was reanimated. Affiliated with the Norwegian Institute of Technology, it had been established in 1934. The Civil Aviation Administration demanded in 1948 that the aviation clubs upgrade the airport,Hafstad: 67 specifically by removing the wooden sections of taxiway and runway. This was carried out as a volunteer service during the fall, which allowed the airport to be rated for commercial services.Hafstad: 68 The two clubs organized an annual air show, both to generate income and to raise the interest for aviation.Hafstad: 71 Trøndelag Flygeselskap remained in business until 1950. A new airline, A/S Trønderfly, was established on 11 July 1950 and bought a single aircraft, serving the uncovered market in the surge of the first company's failure. Trønderfly bought only a single aircraft, which it chose not to insure. The company folded after it crashed the following year. Widerøe thus established itself with a Seabee at Lade in 1951. In addition to the taxi, scenic and ambulance flights, Widerøe also conducted aerial photography, at first using a Fairchild Cornell. From 1956 Widerøe operated a Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior out of Lade and remained at the airport until it closed. Braathens SAFE conducted its first landing at the airport on 9 May 1952, using a de Havilland Heron aircraft.Tjomsland and Wilsberg: 116–117 Regular services to Oslo Airport, Fornebu commenced on 18 August 1953. The airline marketed itself with having a much more central airport than SAS, allowing for shorter travel times than those traveling via Værnes. The lack of a hard landing surface caused seasonal disruptions in operations and in rainy periods Braathens SAFE had to reroute its services to Værnes. As the aircraft also had to use visual flight rules, during foggy weather it was also forced to land at Værnes. During the period that Braathens operated at Lade, it had the responsibility for local air traffic control. Passengers were checked in at the reception of Hotel Astoria in the city center and then bused to the airport. At first there were three weekly round services, increasing to a daily except Saturday service from May 1954. The route had 3900 in 1953.Hafstad: 69 Braathens moved their Lade services to Værnes in 1956, as Lade was not able to accommodate their new, larger Fokker F-27 Friendship aircraft. Lade Airport was originally located in Strinda, a municipality which surrounded the original city-center municipality of Trondheim. The city expanded its borders in 1952, annexing the Lade and the airport. This resulted in Lade being one of very few suitable locations for industry within the city limits. Thus a political debate started to decide if Lade was to be used for industry instead of an airport. The issue was intensified in 1956 when Nidar moved its plant to Strindheim, which at the time was still in Strinda. Trondheim's concern was that they would lose tax income it industrial companies moved to Strinda or other neighboring municipalities.Christiansen: 98–99 Part of the runway was demolished in 1964 and converted to football fields, Lade Anlegget. This resulted in the runway being shortened to for 1965, which became the last year the airport was in operation. The runway and taxiways were thereafter demolished to make way for industry and shopping. Most of the hangars were demolished, although the main hangar remained. The aviation clubs moved to Værnes, which saw a reduction of activity. Longer distances, increased parking and hangar rental fees, the need for radio communication certificates all put their toil on recruitment and retaining members. The aviation club later moved its activities to Jonsvannet.Hafstad: 72 With the closing of the airport, several locals took initiative to establish another airport closer to Trondheim. Heimdal was proposed as a site which would be closer than Værnes, but nothing has ever come of the plans.Christiansen: 106 Facilities Lade Airport was located at Lade, in the area north of the Meråker Line. The main hangar was located next to Leangen Station. The airport had a concrete runway which measured . In addition there were a series of taxiways, partially wooden and partially concrete, which connected to aircraft shelters and hangars. The airport never had any instrument landing system and all aircraft movements required visual flight rules. Widerøe set up a \\"commando center\\" in their hangar and installed VHF radios to communicate with aircraft. During World War II the airport was equipped with anti-aircraft warfare measures including flak guns, barrage balloons and a smoke machine. The flak guns were manned by personnel from the Kriegsmarine and had caliber. There were also a series of machine gun positions with guns.

It comprised approximately two-thirds of modern Prekmurje, Slovenia, and the modern area between the current Slovenian-Hungarian border and the town of Szentgotthárd, where Hungarian Slovenes still live. In Hungarian, the latter area is still known as Vendvidék, which is the Hungarian denomination for the Slovene March, while in Slovene it is referred as Porabje (literally, 'the area along the Rába river'). It should not be confused with the medieval Slovene (or Windic) March of the Holy Roman Empire which was located in the present-day south-east Slovenia, roughly in the areas of the regions of Lower Carniola, White Carniola and Posavje.  Origins of the name The Tótság district in the late 18th century. March, or \\"territory\\" (cognate to \\"mark\\"), is a word indicating a border county of a kingdom. Since the 10th century, the Slovene-inhabited area between the Mura and Rába rivers was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. Most of this area was included in Vas County, while a smaller portion to the southeast (the areas between Lendava and Beltinci) belonged to Zala County. In the 12th century, the bishop of Győr founded a Slovene deanery district in his bishopric, under the name Tótság. The name came from the Hungarian term Tót, which meant 'Slav'. In the local Slovene dialect, the ecclesiastical administrative unit became known as the Szlovenszka okroglina 'Slovene District'. In 1778, this area was transferred to the newly created Bishopric of Szombathely, and the first bishop, János Szily, created a district called Vendvidék 'Wendic March', from the Hungarian term Vend for the local Slovenes. Roman Catholic priests of the region called it Slovenska krajina, from the name of the local Slavic people, which in their local dialect, as in all Slovene dialects, is Slovenci or Slovénge.  The quest for autonomy  In the late 19th century, the Hungarian authorities followed an assimilatory policy towards the minorities, pushing the Catholic majority of Slovenes, and their leaders József Borovnyák and Ferenc Ivanóczy, to aspire for autonomy of the Slovene March. In 1918, with the breakdown of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Slovene politicians in Prekmurje were confronted with the choice between continuing to be part of the newly established Hungarian Democratic Republic, seek for an autonomous entity, establish an independent state (Republic of the Slovene March), or join the new State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (Yugoslavia). The Hungarian republican leaders Mihály Károlyi and Oszkár Jászi were inclined to give a wide autonomy to the Slovene March. The Slovene governor József Klekl worked out a detailed program of autonomy together with Jászi. The proposal included an autonomous Slovene assembly in Murska Sobota, a regional defence unit, the establishment of a Slovene high school in Szentgotthárd, and the introduction of a trilingual administration in the territories of Szentgotthárd, Murska Sobota, Lendava and Őriszentpéter, with an equality between Prekmurje Slovene, Hungarian and German. The name of the proposed entity would be Slovene March (Slovenska krajina). On 19 January 1918, a convention was assembled in Beltinci, which proposed that the Slovene March became an authonom territory in Slovenia and in Yugoslavia. Some Slovene politicians, such as Mihael Kuhar, Joško Godina, Ivan Jerič and the great Slovene politician Anton Korošec also felt that the idea of an independent Slovene March was possible. But Klekl disagreed and pushed for the inclusion of the Slovene March into Slovenia, which was then part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Initially, the area was assigned to Hungary, but with the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution of 1919, the situation changed dramatically. After a short interim of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, the Republic of Prekmurje was proclaimed in late May 1919 by the activist Vilmos Tkálecz. After less than two weeks, the tiny Republic was invaded by the Army of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes that occupied the entire Prekmurje. With the Treaty of Trianon of June 1920, almost the totality of the area was assigned to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.  After 1919  After 1919, the name Slovene March fell into disuse. In the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, it was gradually replaced by the name Prekmurje, although most of the local elites preferred the old name Slovene March. The name however made little sense in the changed circumstances, since the region was not any more a Slovene-speaking peripheral area of Hungary, but was considered part of Slovenia. During the 1920s, the name Slovene March was thus replaced by 'March of the Mura' (Slovene: Murska krajina; Prekmurje dialect: Mörska krajina), which was used together with the denomination Prekmurje (literally 'the region over the Mura' or 'Trans-Mura'). After World War Two, this latter name prevailed, and all the others fell in disuse.

They were the feeder team of the Edmonton Oilers (1980–81 and 1981–82 seasons) and the New Jersey Devils (1982–83). The Wind played in the Central Hockey League (CHL) at the Britt Brown Arena in the Kansas Coliseum. The team's general manager (GM) was Larry Gordon for all three seasons of existence. In June 1980, Gordon was replaced as Oilers' GM and took over as president, owner, and GM of the Wind. The team name was picked from 6,600 entries in a name-the-team contest, and the team's mascot was an orange tornado. Roy Sommer, who went on to become coach of the San Jose Barracuda, was the captain all three seasons of the Wind's existence.  Seasons  The Wind were decimated by injuries their inaugural season. In a game against the Dallas Black Hawks on December 27, 1980, they dressed coach Garnet Bailey as a defenseman and a public relations employee as the backup goaltender; they lost the game 6–3.Gaschnitz, p. 269 Bailey was described by Tom Roulston as \\"just like a big kid\\", who also said that many practices consisted of half-ice scrimmages and shootouts. The team played to sixth place at 32 wins, 45 losses, and 3 ties in the regular season, also gaining the most penalty minutes. Bailey's club won its first playoff series against the Indianapolis Checkers in the decisive fifth game 6–5 on a goal by Tom Roulston, the league's leading scorer. The Wind won the following series 4–2 against the Dallas Black Hawks, who led the regular-season standings. The Wind lost in seven games to the reigning champions, the Salt Lake Golden Eagles, in the Adams Cup championship series. Don Murdoch was named playoff MVP after accumulating 17 goals and 7 assists over 18 games, a CHL playoff record for points. After the season, center Don Ashby, the Wind's second-leading scorer, died in a car crash. In 1983, GM Gordon took the team out of Wichita following disagreements over the leasing of Britt Brown Arena, seen here during a Wichita Thunder's game. The Wind, now coached by John Muckler, concluded the 1981–82 pre-season with a 5–4 loss to the Golden Eagles. A good checking team but lacking in offensive power, only four Wichita players averaged over one point per game. Following a game in which the team received 19 fighting penalties, Muckler and eight other members of the organization spent a night in jail for a nightclub altercation. The owner of a disco club asked police to remove the players from his property; Muckler said police \\"panicked\\" and \\"didn't handle the situation very professionally\\". After winning twice and tying once in their last three games, the Wind finished the regular season 44–33–3, first in the league's South division. In the first round of the playoffs, the Wind swept three games from the Nashville South Stars; 1981–82 was their only season in the CHL. In the following round, Wichita was dismissed by the Checkers after losing four consecutive games. In August 1982, Muckler was named assistant coach of the Oilers and replaced by Andy Laing. Additionally, the New Jersey Devils replaced the Oilers as the Wind's parent team. The Wind missed the playoffs for the first time, finishing in sixth place with a 29–48–3. They were eliminated from playoff contention early in the season. It was announced after the season that the team would not play in Wichita a fourth year because of conflicts over the lease on the Kansas Coliseum. The Coliseum's owners wanted a two-year commitment while GM Gordon wanted a one-year lease. Additionally, the team lacked a practice facility; Gordon said the team \\"bent over backward to keep hockey in Wichita\\". A preliminary agreement was reached to move the team to Yellowstone METRA (now Rimrock Auto Arena) in Billings, Montana, where they later became the Montana Magic during the 1983-84 season.

In 2006, he was awarded the Sternberg Interfaith Award from philanthropist Sir Sigmund Sternberg \\"in recognition of outstanding services in furthering relations between faiths\\".News summary announcing prize In June 2007 The Times Higher Education newspaper described him as \\"probably the most prolific interfaith figure in British academia\\".Times Higher Education article In 2011 he was awarded an MBE awarded for services to interfaith relationsJewish Chronicle Queen's Birthday Honours Kessler has published 12 books, most recently, Jews, Christians and Muslims which was published in 2013 by SCM and Jesus which was published in 2016 by The History Press. Kessler was Convenor and Vice-Chair for the Commission on Religion and Belief in British Public Life (2013-15), a two-year initiative that examined the role of religion and belief in Britain. Its report, \\"Living with Difference\\" made 37 recommendations and generated public controversy, particularly over faith schools. Kessler sits on the Foreign & Commonwealth Office's Advisory group on Freedom of Religion and Belief and regularly teaches FCO staff on how and why religion can fundamentally affect policy. Much of his work has been examining scripture and exploring the significance for Jewish-Christian relations of sharing a sacred text. He has identified a common exegetical tradition, especially in the formative centuries. More recently his writings have focussed on the encounter with Islam and contemporary relations between the three Abrahamic faiths and implications for fostering a vibrant and open society. Kessler proposes approaches for managing difference, which he argues is vital in forming a positive identity as well as sustaining communities. In his discussion on covenantal theology, he argues for the creation of ‘theological space’ in which people of faith can affirm one another without losing their particularities of faith.http://www.sju.edu/int/academics/centers/ijcr/pdf/Kessler_Covenant%20and%20Conversion.pdf In recent years he has concentrated on the contemporary relationship between religion and society. At a lecture at the Brookings Institution in 2014, he argued that diplomats and policymakers need to be better trained in religion and belief, describing the contemporary religious landscape as a post- interfaith world. In 2019, at The Council for Religious and Life Stance Communities in Oslo, he argued that because religious monopolies are in decline, Christianity can no longer be portrayed as the dominant ‘host’ religion in Europe and a previously intrinsic relationship is being weakened - belonging to a minority is the norm.

They gave two performances in London in March and June 1977, and then embarked on two tours of Europe between September 1977 and May 1978, where they performed in Italy, France and Sweden. History Henry Cow and the Mike Westbrook Brass Band crossed paths several times before they merged in 1977. Westbrook was one of the guests at Henry Cow's Rainbow Theatre concert with Faust in London in October 1973, and the Brass Band played for the audience in the foyer of the auditorium before the concert began. At the November 1975 Sigma Festival in Bordeaux, France, Henry Cow and the Brass Band performed in different parts of the same building, and at the end of Henry Cow's set, the Brass Band played a New Orleans funeral march from the audience while the members of Henry Cow danced together on stage. Then in October 1976, Henry Cow, the Mike Westbrook Brass Band and folk singer Frankie Armstrong performed different sets on the same bill at Goldsmith College in New Cross, London. When they appeared on the same bill again on 13 March 1977, this time at the Moving Left Revue at The Roundhouse in London, Henry Cow, the Brass Band and Armstrong decided to merge and gave their debut performance. The Moving Left Revue was a Communist Party benefit concert that the Brass Band's Paul Rutherford had helped to organise. Steve Lake of the British music newspaper, Melody Maker described the three- hour concert as \\"a great success\\", and said that this merger was the \\"most exciting\\" of Henry Cow's succession of projects. Their drummer, Chris Cutler said that they had always wanted the explore the potential of an orchestra, and their \\"ideological common ground\\" made a cooperative venture inevitable. On 26 June 1977 the Orckestra performed at the Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park. Reviewing the event in The Guardian, Ronald Atkins wrote that he was impressed by how wide-ranging the ensemble's music was, which, he said, \\"could hardly be equalled by any other group\\". In September 1977 they embarked on a three-month tour of Europe where they played at Milan and Modena in Italy, and at Nancy and Paris in France. In March 1978 the Orckestra returned to Europe where they played in Stockholm, Norrköping and Gothenburg in Sweden, Oslo in Norway, and Paris, Nancy, Longlaville, Loos-en-Gohelle, Poitiers, Orléans and Bordeaux in France. While Henry Cow enjoyed playing in the Orckestra, the merger was not without its problems. The Brass Band had difficulty coming to terms with Henry Cow's irregular rhythms. Westbrook said, \\"In jazz, because of its origins in dance, we always have a pulse to relate to\\", but Henry Cow's approach \\"is totally alien to our way of writing and thinking about music.\\" As a result the ensemble's concerts tended to be dominated by Brass Band material, with a few selected Henry Cow pieces the group could perform. Atkins wrote that at the Regent's Park event, \\"the group sounded rather like the Westbrook band augmented by a rhythm section.\\" The lack of rehearsal time also affected the ensemble's performances, and there was never enough time for the Brass Band to learn Henry Cow's work. No new material was written for the group, although Henry Cow and Rutherford did collaborate on some arrangements for it to perform. The Orckestra's last concert was on 24 May 1978 in Bordeaux, France, after which they decided to disband. Georgie Born and Lindsay Cooper from Henry Cow, however, continued to collaborate with Westbrook for several more years. Music The Orckestra did not generate any new material, and generally performed pieces that the Mike Westbrook Brass Band, Henry Cow and Frankie Armstrong performed individually. At their debut performance at the Roundhouse, their set list was: *\\"Wheel of Fortune\\" *\\"Beautiful as the Moon...\\" *\\"Django\\" *\\"God Bless the Child\\" *\\"Naima\\" *\\"Mourn not the Dead\\" *\\"Anthem\\" *\\"Jackie-ing\\" *\\"On Suicide\\" *\\"Lady Howard's Coach\\" *\\"Kanonensong\\" *\\"Santiago, You are Suffering\\" *\\"Let the Slave\\" *\\"Serpent Maigre\\" *\\"Bartlemy Fair\\" *\\"The Saucy Sailor\\" *\\"Little Duke Arthur's Nurse\\" *\\"Sovay, Sovay\\" *\\"Jack the Lad\\" *\\"Holy Thursday\\" *\\"I See Thy Form\\" *\\"Alabama Song\\" Henry Cow later incorporated some of the Brass Band pieces into their own sets, for example, \\"Jackie-ing\\" which appears on Volume 9: Late in The 40th Anniversary Henry Cow Box Set (2009). Recordings No recordings of the Orckestra were released during their lifetime. A live album of extracts from their 20 November 1977 Paris concert at the Fête du Nouveau Populaire in the Hippodrome was planned, but was abandoned when it was discovered that the recording was sub-standard and that it had been premixed. A bootleg recording of this concert was released in 2003, but its sound quality has been reported as being poor. The first officially released recording of the Orckestra appeared in 2006 when a 12-minute 3\\" CD single, \\"Unreleased Orckestra Extract\\" was given to subscribers of the Henry Cow Box. It contained an untitled piece by Fred Frith and \\"Would You Prefer Us to Lie?\\" by Chris Cutler and John Greaves, both taken from some of the Orckestra's live performances in Europe in March–May 1978. The two pieces were later reissued on Ex Box – Collected Fragments 1971–1978, a bonus CD given to subscribers of The Henry Cow Box Redux: The Complete Henry Cow (2019).

The name is a misnomer, because pink algae is not a true algae but is actually caused by a bacterium in the genus Methylobacterium. The color of the bacterial growth comes from pigments within its cells. The slime formed around the bacteria provides it with a relatively high level of protection from external threats. Like other species in its genus, pink algae is a methane consuming bacterium. It has an affinity for the matrix of PVC plastics, and will attach itself to both the inside and the outside of PVC materials inside of the pool. Pink algae infestation in a pool often occurs alongside an infestation of white water mold. Prevention Prevention of pink algae is the easiest way to deal with the problem. To ensure that pink algae does not grow in a pool, the owner must manually brush and clean all pool surfaces weekly, and regularly expose all pools surfaces to sunlight (pink algae thrives in a dark environment, particularly in areas with slow moving water). Regular doses of certain chemicals are also recommended in a preventative plan against pink algae. Treatment All visible pink algae must be manually removed from a pool. A dose of algicide, followed by a shock treatment is also necessary to destroy the bacteria. The pool filter must be run constantly until the water is clear and halogen or peroxide levels are normal, then the filter must be chemically cleaned.

Since 1949 the Communist Party of China has shaped the economy of China through the plenary sessions of the Central Committee and national congresses. The Party plays a leading role in establishing the foundations and principles of Chinese communism, mapping strategies for economic development, setting growth targets, and launching reforms. Planning is a key characteristic of socialist economies, and one plan established for the entire country normally contains detailed economic development guidelines for all its regions. In order to more accurately reflect China's transition from a Soviet-style command economy to a socialist market economy (socialism with Chinese characteristics), the name of the 11th five-year program of 2006 to 2010 was changed to \\"guideline\\" () instead of \\"plan\\" (). First Plan (1953–1957) Chairman Mao and Various Leaders of the First Five Year Plan - 1956 Having restored a viable economic base, the leadership under Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and other revolutionary veterans were prepared to embark on an intensive program of industrial growth and socialization. For this purpose, the administration adopted the Soviet economic model, based on state ownership in the modern sector, large collective units in agriculture, and centralized economic planning. The Soviet approach to economic development was manifested in the First Five-Year Plan (1953–1957). The key tasks highlighted in the Plan were: *Concentrate efforts on the construction of 694 large and medium-sized industrial projects, including 156 with the aid of the Soviet Union *Lay out the primary foundations for China's socialist industrialization *Develop agricultural producers’ cooperatives to help in the socialist transformation of the agriculture and handicraft industries *Put capitalist industry and commerce on the track of state capitalism *Facilitate the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. Accumulated investment in capital construction was 55 billion yuan and fixed asset increments reached 46.05 billion yuan, 1.9 times higher than at the end of 1952. About 595 large and medium-sized projects were completed and put into production, laying the framework of China's industrialization. The gross value of industrial products in 1957 increased 128.6% from 1952. *Steel production in 1953 was 1.35 million metric tons. In 1957, Soviet Union-assisted Chinese production of steel had risen to 5.35 million metric tons. *Coal production in 1957 reached 131 million tons, increasing 98% from 1952. *Gross output value from industry and agriculture rose from 30% in 1949 to 56.5% in 1957, while that of heavy industry increased from 26.4% to 48.4%. In 1957, grain production reached 195 billion kilograms and cotton output 32.8 million dan (1 dan = 50 kilograms), both surpassing the targets set in the Plan. The two major problems that arose during this period were the following: Agricultural production couldn't keep pace with industrial production. The Plan regarded gross industrial output value accounting for 70% of the gross output value of industry and agriculture and means of production accounting for 60% of the gross industrial output value as indicators of industrial modernization, which ignored the development agriculture in some sense. In addition, investments in capital construction in 1956 totaled 14.735 billion yuan, increasing 70% over the previous year. Fiscal expenditure in the form of infrastructure loans rose to 48% from 30% from 1955, putting a strain on the national budget as a result. As in the Soviet economy, the main objective was a high rate of economic growth, with primary emphasis on industrial development at the expense of agriculture and particular concentration on heavy industry and capital-intensive technology. Soviet planners helped their Chinese counterparts formulate the plan. Large numbers of Soviet engineers, technicians, and scientists assisted in developing and installing new heavy industrial facilities, including entire plants and pieces of equipment purchased from the Soviet Union. Government control over industry was increased during this period by applying financial pressures and inducements to convince owners of private, modern firms to sell them to the state or convert them into joint public-private enterprises under state control. By 1956, approximately 67.5% of all modern industrial enterprises were state owned, and 32.5% were under joint public-private ownership, with no privately owned firms remaining. During the same period, the handicraft industries were organized into cooperatives, which accounted for 91.7% of all handicraft workers by 1956. Agriculture also underwent extensive organizational changes. To facilitate the mobilization of agricultural resources, improve the efficiency of farming, and increase government access to agricultural products, the authorities encouraged farmers to organize cooperative farming, starting in 1953. Since traditional family farming practices were not sufficient to bankroll the country's ambitious industrialization projects, party officials encouraged families to pool their farms into small cooperatives in order to increase farm yields. Unlike the large scale collective farming policies which began in 1958, the cooperatives were successful and popular. Local parties representatives, such as Geng Xiufeng, largely met support from local farmersas detailed in the Ambrica Films documentary, China: A Century of Revolution, part two, 1949–1976. By the end of 1955 almost 2/3, about 60%, of all Chinese farmers were engaged in cooperative farming. Farming families, who previously engaged largely in subsistence farming, now began raising and selling livestock based on the increase in grain surpluses, which was directly responsible for the practices popularity and rapid rate of enrollment. Central committee planning dictated that from the loosely structured, tiny mutual aid teams, villages were to advance first to lower-stage, agricultural producers' cooperatives, in which families still received some income on the basis of the amount of land they contributed, and eventually to advanced cooperatives, or collectives beginning in 1958 with the second Five Year Plan. In the agricultural producers' cooperatives, income shares were designed to be based only on the amount of labor contributed. In reality, small farming markets that revolved around cooperative surpluses, sprang up across the nation. The land reforms from 1949–1951 increased private land ownership, with typical results increasing land ownership of farmers from just under one acre to approximately three acres. The cooperative process, began in 1953, accelerated quickly, slowly from 1955 to 1956. By 1957 about 93.5% of all farm households had joined producers' cooperatives. In terms of economic growth, the First Five-Year Plan was quite successful, especially in those areas emphasized by the Soviet-style development strategy. A solid foundation was created in heavy industry. Key industries, including iron and steel manufacturing, coal mining, cement production, electricity generation, and machine building were greatly expanded and were put on a firm, modern technological footing. Thousands of industrial and mining enterprises were constructed, including 156 major facilities. Industrial production increased at an average annual rate of 19% between 1952 and 1957, and national income grew at a rate of 9% a year. Despite the lack of state investment in agriculture, agricultural output increased substantially, averaging increases of about 4% a year. This growth resulted primarily from gains in efficiency brought about by the reorganization and cooperation achieved through cooperative farming. As the First Five-Year Plan wore on, however, Chinese leaders became increasingly concerned over the relatively sluggish performance of agriculture and the inability of state trading companies to increase significantly the amount of grain procured from rural units for urban consumption, and for funding the many large urban industrialization projects. Second Plan (1958–1962) This plan was created to accomplish several tasks, including: *Expanding heavy industry in China. *Furthering the cause of socialism by transferring more property to collective ownership. *Encouraging the economic growth of China through industry, agriculture, handicrafts, transportation and commerce. *Cultivating cultural and scientific development of the Chinese people. *Strengthening national defense and improving living standards in China. The Political Bureau of the CPC had determined that gross value of agricultural products should increase 270%; in fact, the gain was a considerably more modest 35%. Nevertheless, the plan was successful in some respects. The country saw increases in capital construction over those observed during the first Five-Year Plan and also saw significant increases in industry (doubling output value) and income (workers and farmers, increase by as much as 30%). However, the Great Leap Forward, which diverted millions of agricultural workers into industry, and the great sparrow campaign, which led to an infestation of locusts, as well as unprecedented natural and weather based issues, caused a huge decrease in food production. Simultaneously, rural officials, under huge pressure to meet their quotas, vastly overstated how much grain was available. Thus, a massive nationwide famine ensued, which was avoidable, but the government continued with its policy. Third Plan (1966–1970) The Third Plan was originally due early in 1963, but at that time China's economy was too dislocated, as a result of the failure of the Great Leap Forward and four poor harvest, to permit any planned operations. Research and study into the elements of this Plan started in early 1964. The Plan contained two comparatively detailed schemes: one was the Preliminary Tentative Plan of the 3rd Five-year Plan (1966–1970) proposed by the State Planning Commission and agreed by the Central Government Work Meeting in May 1964; the other was the Report Syllabus about the Arrangement of the 3rd Five-year Plan drawn out by the State Planning Commission and agreed by the central government in September 1965. The Tentative Plan set out the following basic tasks: #To spare no efforts to develop agriculture, solve widespread problems concerning people's food, clothing and other basic needs; #To strengthen national defense, and endeavor to make breakthroughs in technology; #In order to support agriculture and strengthen national defense, to enhance infrastructure, continue to improve production quality, increase production variety and quantity, to build an economy of self-reliance, and to develop transportation, commerce, culture, education and scientific research. The Plan also called for the prioritization of national defense in the light of a possible big war, actively preparing for conflicts and speeding up construction in three key areas; national defense, science and technology, and industry and transport infrastructure. The outputs of other newly added major products were 68.06 million tons of coal; 8.60 million kilowatts of electricity; 27.77 million tons of petroleum; 6.53 million tons of steels; 35.90 million tons of iron ore; 2.44 million tons of synthesized ammonia; 2.04 million tons of fertilizers; 15.33 million tons of cement; 187,000 tons of plastics; 3.22 million tons of cotton spindles; 12,300 tons of chemical fibers; 3,894 kilometers of newly constructed railways and 31,223 kilometers of newly constructed highways were put into operation; and handling capacity of the coastal harbors were over 11.91 million tons. This plan was more successful than anticipated, with the industrial and agricultural goals exceed by 14.1% and industrial gross output value goals by 21.1%. Agricultural gains also exceeded goals, but more moderately, with a 2.2% rise above expectations. According to the Official Portal of the Chinese Government, however, the focus on accumulation and rapid development in this and preceding plans were impediments to long-term economic development. Fourth Plan (1971–1975) A first draft of the Plan was developed and agreed upon in September 1970 at the 2nd Plenary Session of the 9th Communist Party Central Committee, which stipulated:http://www.china.org.cn/archive/2006-02/27/content_1157612.htm *The average annual growth rate of gross output value of industry and agriculture reach 12.5% *130 billion yuan would be budgeted for infrastructure construction within five years *Expected industrial output would reach between 300 and 325 billion kilograms of grain, between 65 and 70 million piculs (3.9–4.2 billion kilograms) of cotton, between 35 and 40 million tons of steel, between 400 and 430 million tons of coal, between 200 and 220 billion kWh of electricity, and between 900 million and 1 billion tons of railway freight In July 1973, the State Planning Commission amended the draft, lowering some of the targets initially set. Steel output was reduced to between 32 and 35 million tons and later further reduced to 30 million tons. The national economy took a favorable turn in 1972 and 1973. By 1973, all major economic indices had been fulfilled or exceeded, making it the year with the fastest economic growth. Fifth Plan (1976–1980) The central government stipulated the 1976–1985 Ten Year Plan Outline of Developing National Economy (Draft) in 1975, which included the 5th Five-Year Plan. In March 1978, the Ten Year Development Outline was amended because the original version in 1975 stipulated that by 1985, steel and petroleum outputs should reach 60 and 250 million tons respectively, and 120 large projects, including 10 steel production bases, nine non-ferrous metal bases, eight coal bases and 10 oil and gas fields, should be built. To achieve these goals, the government would invest 70 billion yuan in infrastructure construction, equaling total national investment over the previous 28 years. These were impossible targets and ran counter to economic development rules. The Plan put forward suggestions to set up an independent and comparatively complete industrial system and national economic system from 1978 to 1980. With the implementation of the Plan, considerable success was achieved. In 1977, the gross output value of industry and agriculture reached 505.5 billion yuan, 4.4% above-target and representing an increase of 10.4% compared with the previous year. Gross domestic product for 1978 reached 301 billion yuan, an increase of 12.3% compared with 1977, and an increase of 19.4% compared with 1976. However, during this period, the Chinese economy developed too quickly, and the very high goals triggered the onset of yet another round of mistakes. In December 1978, the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Communist Party Central Committee shifted the work focus of the Communist Party to modernization. The Session emphasized that the development should follow economic rules and proposed readjustment and reform measures, which indicated that national economic development had entered a new phase, one of exploration and development. In April 1979, the central government formally put forward new principles of readjustment, reform, rectification and improvement. Note: This Summary was prepared by the China Daily newspaper, owned directly by the Communist Party of Chinahttp://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012npc/2011-02/23/content_14689645.htm Sixth Plan (1981–1985) This Plan took some time to draft. It was first planned as part of the \\"Ten Year National Economic Development Plan Outline for 1976–1985.\\" In February 1980, the State Council decided to redraft the country's mid- and long-term plans. It convened a seminar to discuss the compilation of the 6th Five-Year Plan. To that end, the State Planning Commission and related departments also carried out extensive research and calculation work on the compilation of the Plan, and organized related experts to conduct scientific appraisals. The 1982 national planning meeting was again mainly focused on the drafting of the Plan. It was only in December that year that the fifth meeting of the Fifth National People's Congress officially ratified the Plan. It was a more comprehensive plan compared to its predecessors since it adjusted and set national economic development onto a more stable and healthy track, with general objectives to: *Keep pursuing the principle of \\"adjust, reform, rectify and improve\\" *Further overcome the various challenges to economic development *Achieve a decisive turn in the fiscal situation *Lay a solid foundation for the advancement of national economic and social development under the next planning period. Specific objectives included: #To achieve an average annual growth rate of 5% for industrial and agricultural products. #To keep the supply and quality of consumer products in line with the growth of social purchasing power and changes in consumption structure, and to keep market prices stable. #To vigorously cut down material consumption, particularly that of energy, and keep production in line with the availability of resources. #To encourage and implement enterprise technological updating, with energy saving as a priority, and to gather the capital necessary to strengthen the construction of key projects energy and communications in preparation for the 7th Five-Year Plan. #To assemble the country's scientific and technological base for scientific and technological research and to promote the application of new technologies, and to strenuously develop education, science and culture to accelerate the construction of an ideological and material civilization. #To strengthen the construction of the national defense industry, and enhance national defensive forces. #To strengthen production and improve economic efficiency to increase the government's revenue, to gradually increase expenditure on economic and cultural construction and to secure a balance between fiscal revenue and expenditure and credit. #To strenuously develop trade, make effective use of foreign capital and actively introduce advanced technology to meet domestic needs. #To strictly control the growth of population, make proper employment arrangement for labor forces in the cities and towns, and continuously improve the material and cultural life of people both in cities and the rural areas based on the growth of production and productive efficiency. #To strengthen environmental protection efforts. The Plan was overall a great success: *The national economy maintained a stable rate of growth. The average annual growth rate for industrial and agricultural products was 11%. The gross national product in 1985 reached 778 billion yuan ($113 billion), signifying an average annual growth of 10% after inflation since 1980. *Production volume of key products rose dramatically. Compared with 1980, 1985 saw a growth of 26.1% for steel, 37.1% for coal, 35.8% for electricity, 17.9% for crude oil, 92.8% for cotton and 21.4% for grain. *Progress was achieved in infrastructure construction and technological updating. Total investment in fixed assets for publicly owned enterprises reached 530 billion yuan. 496 middle and large projects were constructed and started, and another 200,000 projects were transformed and updated. *The fiscal situation improved gradually year by year. Fiscal revenue grew by an average of 15.9 billion yuan every year, which represented an annual growth of 12% thereby realizing a balance between fiscal revenue and expenditure. *China's foreign trade transactions and technological exchange entered a new phase. On the world export volume ranking, China rose from No. 28 in 1980 to No .10 in 1984. Alternatively, several negative results included a disproportionately high fixed asset ratio, rapid growth in consumption and fiscal over-supply. All of this negatively impacted the economy's stability and growth.

It was the first time in China's history that an all-round plan for social and economic development was created at the start of a new five-year plan. The fundamental principles and guidelines of the 7th Five Year Plan were: #To put reform at the top of the agenda and coordinate economic development with reform. #To maintain a basic balance between overall social demand and supply, between the national budget, credit and materials. #To improve economic efficiency, especially that of product quality; to properly handle the relations between efficiency and growth rate, and quality and quantity. #To adapt to the changing structure of social demand and the demands of economic modernization, and to further adjust the industrial structure. #To regulate fixed asset investments, readjust the investment structure, and speed up the construction of the energy, communications, telecommunications and raw materials industries. #To shift the construction focus to the technical updating, reforming and extending of existing enterprises. #To further the development of science and education. #To further open up to the outside world, combining domestic economic growth with expanding external economic and technologic exchanges. #To further improve the material and cultural life of all Chinese people. #To strenuously boost the construction of a socialist ideological civilization along with the construction of a material civilization. #To carry on in the spirit of arduous struggle, hard work and thrift. Specific goals of economic development set out in the Plan were: *To increase gross national industrial and agricultural output by 38% within five years, or by an average annual rate of 6.7%, gross agricultural output by 4% a year, and gross industrial output by 7.5%. *To increase gross national output by 44% within five years, or by an average annual rate of 7.5%. *Production goals for major industrial and agricultural products by 1990 were: between 425 and 450 billion tons for grain, 4.25 million tons for cotton, 550 billion kWh for electricity, 1 billion tons for raw coal, 150 million tons for crude oil, and between 55 and 58 million tons for steel. Freight volume was set at 9.4 billion tons. *Investment in fixed assets was set at 1,296 billion yuan, with fixed assets projected to grow by 600 billion yuan. *To increase total import and export volumes by 35% within the five years, while expanding the scale of foreign investment and advanced technology. Further, goals were set to increase the actual consumption of both urban and rural residents by 5% a year, and at the same time keeping the basic balance between the national budget, credit, material and foreign exchange. *In the field of education, to gradually popularize and implement the nine- year compulsory education scheme, and train five million professionals, twice that during the previous planning period.

Under Deng Xiaoping's leadership, this Plan marked the start of a new phase in China's development. The national economy maintained its growth momentum during this time. Gross national product in 1995 reached 5.76 trillion yuan ($730 billion), 4.3 times higher than that in 1980. Outputs of coal, cement, TV, foodstuff, cotton and cotton dresses were the highest in the world, with steel and chemical fiber outputs second, and electricity supply third. China's economy experienced an annual growth of 11%, 4 percentage points higher than that during the 7th Five-Year planning period. Total investment in fixed assets during this time hit 3.89 trillion yuan, with an annual growth rate of 17.9%, 13.6 percentage points higher than the previous planning period. Of these, state-owned units’ investments saw an annual growth of 22.9%, much higher than the average growth of 4.1% previously. 845 large and medium-sized infrastructure projects were completed and put into production, as were 374 technical innovation projects. In terms of transportation infrastructure, 5,800 kilometers of trunk railway, 3,400 kilometers of double-track lines, and 2,600 kilometers of electrified railway were built. Road lengths were increased by 105,000 kilometers, including 1,600 kilometers of highway. The throughput of ports increased by 138 million tons and 12 new airports were built. 100,000 kilometers of long-distance trunk cable were finished, and the number of telephone switchboards increased to 58.95 million sets. Total installed generation capacity was increased to 75 million kilowatts, and annual electricity supply grew by 9%. Output value of the primary industry increased at an annual growth rate of 4.1%, the secondary industry at a rate of 17.3%, and the tertiary industry at a rate of 9.5%. Output composition of the three sectors stood at 20.3: 47.7:32.0; it was 28.4:43.1:28.5 at the end of the 6th, and 27.1:41.6:31.3 at the end of the 7th Five-Year Program periods respectively. Significant achievements were also made in the reform of the economic system. The new financial system with tax decentralization at its core, and the new tax system with value-added tax as its main component, were set up. Policy finance and commercial finance were gradually separated. A macro regulating system emerged, and the market started to play a more major role in resource allocation. Also mapped out were the beginnings of a dominant public sector. More than 1,100 cities at county level were opened to the outside world, and 13 bonded zones and other a lot of economic development zones were set up. Foreign trade developed at an astonishing pace with total trade volume reaching US$1.0145 trillion, at an annual growth rate of 19.5%, higher than the 12.8% and 10.6% growth rates during the 6th and 7th Five-Year periods respectively. The value of annual export volume was 100 billion yuan, accounting for 3% of the world's commodity trade. By import and export trade volume, China ranked 11th in the world in 1995. Foreign exchange reserves reached US$73.6 billion, 5.6 times higher than that at the end of the 7th Five-Year period. Major improvements were also made to people's lives. Per capita income was 1,578 yuan in 1995 ($230). Retail sales reached 6.7275 trillion yuan, representing an annual growth rate of 10.6% as compared to 3.3% during the 7th Five-Year period. Savings deposit balances in urban and rural areas reached 3 trillion yuan, 2 trillion higher than at the end of the previous planning period. Per capita floor space of newly built houses in urban and rural areas reached 4.3 billion square meters. At the end of 1994, rural residents' per capita living space was 20.5 square meters, and 7.7 square meters for urban residents. China registered an increase of 50 million in terms of social labor forces, including 37.4 million in the urban areas. The population of the extreme poor decreased from 85 million at the end of the 1980s to 65 million in 1995. Population control was achieved during this period, with growth rates dropping from 14.4% in 1990 to 10.6% in 1995. Rates of radio and TV population coverage reached 78.7% and 84.8% respectively, 4 and 5% respectively higher than in 1990. Ninth Plan (1996–2000) The Fifth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee adopted the Proposal on the Ninth Five-Year Plan on National Economy and Social Development and Long-Range Objectives to the Year 2010 on 28 September 1995. It was the first medium-length plan made under a socialist market economy, and a cross-century development strategy. The basic tasks stipulated in the Plan were to complete the second phase in the modernization drive; to cap population growth at 300 million by 2000; to quadruple per capita GNP as compared to 1980; to eliminate poverty; and to speed up the establishment of a modern enterprise system. Long-range objectives to the year 2010 were to double 2000's GNP; and to continue to build the socialist market economic system. Tenth Plan (2001–2005) The basic tasks set out in the 10th Plan were: #Achieve an average annual economic growth rate of about 7%. #Achieve a GDP of 12,500 billion yuan by 2005, calculated at 2000 prices, and per capita GDP of 9,400 yuan. #Increase the number of urban employees and the number of surplus rural laborers transferred to the cities to 40 million each, thereby controlling registered urban unemployment rates at about 5%. #Keep prices stable, and to maintain the balance between international revenue and expenditure. #Optimize and upgrade the industrial structure, and strengthen China's international competitiveness. #Achieve growth for the primary, secondary and tertiary industries at the rates of 13, 51 and 36% respectively of GDP, with those employed by these industries accounting for 44, 23 and 33% of the total number of employees in the country. #Improve the national economy and social IT levels. #Kick-start the operations of more infrastructure facilities. #Bring the development disparity between regions under effective control, and raise levels of urbanization. #Raise research and development funding to more than 1.5% of GDP, and strengthen sci-tech innovation capabilities, thereby speeding up technological progress. #Increase gross enrollment rates in junior high schools, senior high schools and higher education institutions to over 90%, 60% and 15% respectively. #Reduce natural population growth rate to less than nine per thousand, and capping population at no more than 1.33 billion by 2005. On the environmental front, to increase forest coverage to 18.2%, and the urban green rate to 35%. The total amount of major urban and rural pollutants discharged will be reduced by 10% as compared with 2000, and more measures would be taken to protect and save natural resources. The Plan also set out to increase the growth rates of disposable income of urban residents and the net income of rural residents to five procent each. In addition, objectives were set to increase housing floor space per urban resident to 22 sq m by 2005, and to install 40% of all households in China with cable TV. Another key objective was to improve medical and health services in both urban and rural areas. Eleventh Plan (2006–2010) According to draft guidelines submitted to the 2006 National People's Congress session, the goals of the Eleventh Five-Year Guideline were: Economic growth: #GDP up 7.5% annually from 18.2 trillion yuan in 2005 to 26.1 trillion yuan in 2010; #Per capita GDP up 6.6% annually from 13,985 yuan in 2005 to 19,270 yuan in 2010. Economic structure: #Share of service industry's value added to GDP up from 40.3% in 2005 to 43.3% in 2010; #Share of employment in service industry up from 31.3% to 35.3% in 2010; #Share of research and development (R&D;) spending out of total GDP up from 1.3% in 2005 to 2% in 2010; #Urbanization rate up from 43% in 2005 to 47% in 2010.

Public service, people's life: #Term of education per capita up from 8.5 years in 2005 to nine years in 2010; #Coverage of urban basic old-age pension up from 174 million people in 2005 to 223 million people in 2010; #Coverage of the new rural cooperative medical care system up from 23.5% in 2005 to over 80% in 2010; #New jobs created for urban residents reaching 45 million in five years; #Number of rural laborers transferred to non- agriculture sectors reaching 45 million in five years; #Urban registered unemployment rate up from 4.2% in 2005 to 5% in 2010; #Per capita disposable income of urban residents up 5% annually in five years, from 10,493 yuan in 2005 to 13,390 yuan in 2010; #Per capita net income of rural residents up 5% annually in five years, from 3,255 yuan in 2005 to 4,150 yuan in 2010. Twelfth Plan (2011–2015) The Twelfth Five-Year Guideline was debated in mid-October 2010 at the fifth plenary session of the 17th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the same session in which Xi Jinping was selected as Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission. A full proposal for the plan was released following the plenum and approved by the National People's Congress on 14 March 2011, with the goals of addressing rising inequality and creating an environment for more sustainable growth by prioritizing more equitable wealth distribution, increased domestic consumption, and improved social infrastructure and social safety nets. The plan is representative of China's efforts to rebalance its economy, shifting emphasis from investment towards consumption and development from urban and coastal areas toward rural and inland areas – initially by developing small cities and greenfield districts to absorb coastal migration. The plan also continues to advocate objectives set out in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan to enhance environmental protection, accelerate the process of opening and reform, and emphasize Hong Kong's role as a center of international finance. The targets for the Twelfth Five-Year Guideline in 2011 were to grow of GDP by around 8%, 7% annual growth of per capita income, spend 2.2% of GDP on research and development by 2015, bring the population below 1.39 billion by 2015, readjust income distribution to stop the yawning gap, firmly curb excessive rise of housing prices, implement prudent monetary policy, intensify anti-corruption efforts, accelerate economic restructuring, and deal with the complex situations in development in 2011.

The MMRTG was developed by an industry team of Aerojet Rocketdyne and Teledyne Energy Systems. Background Space exploration missions require safe, reliable, long-lived power systems to provide electricity and heat to spacecraft and their science instruments. A uniquely capable source of power is the radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) – essentially a nuclear battery that reliably converts heat into electricity. Radioisotope power has been used on eight Earth orbiting missions, eight missions to the outer planets, and the Apollo missions after Apollo 11 to Earth's moon. The outer Solar System missions are the Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, Ulysses, Galileo, Cassini and New Horizons missions. The RTGs on Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have been operating since 1977. In total, over the last four decades, 26 missions and 45 RTGs have been launched by the United States. Function Solid-state thermoelectric couples convert the heat from the natural decay of the radioisotope plutonium-238 dioxide to electricity.SNAP-19: Pioneer F & G, Final Report, Teledyne Isotopes, 1973 Unlike solar arrays, RTGs are not dependent upon the Sun, so they can be used for deep space missions. History In June 2003, the Department of Energy (DOE) awarded the MMRTG contract to a team led by Aerojet Rocketdyne. Aerojet Rocketdyne and Teledyne Energy Systems collaborated on an MMRTG design concept based on a previous thermoelectric converter design, SNAP-19, developed by Teledyne for previous space exploration missions. SNAP-19s powered Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 missions as well as the Viking 1 and Viking 2 landers. Design and specifications The MMRTG is powered by eight Pu-238 dioxide general-purpose heat source (GPHS) modules, provided by the Department of Energy. Initially, these eight GPHS modules generate about 2 kW thermal power. The MMRTG design incorporates PbTe/TAGS thermoelectric couples (from Teledyne Energy Systems), where the TAGS material is a material incorporating Tellurium (Te), Silver (Ag), Germanium (Ge) and Antimony (Sb). The MMRTG is designed to produce 125 W electrical power at the start of mission, falling to about 100 W after 14 years.http://pdf.aiaa.org/preview/CDReadyMIECEC06_1309/PV2006_4187.pdf With a mass of 45 kg the MMRTG provides about 2.8 W/kg of electrical power at beginning of life. The MMRTG design is capable of operating both in the vacuum of space and in planetary atmospheres, such as on the surface of Mars. Design goals for the MMRTG included ensuring a high degree of safety, optimizing power levels over a minimum lifetime of 14 years, and minimizing weight. Usage in space missions The multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator of Mars Science Laboratory. Curiosity, the MSL rover that was successfully landed in Gale Crater on August 6, 2012, uses one MMRTG to supply heat and electricity for its components and science instruments. Reliable power from the MMRTG will allow it to operate for several years. (pdf) October 2013 On February 20, 2015, a NASA official reported that there is enough plutonium available to NASA to fuel three more MMRTG like the one used by the Curiosity rover. One is already committed to the Mars 2020 rover. The other two have not been assigned to any specific mission or program, and could be available by late 2021. A MMRTG was successfully launched into orbit on July 30, 2020 aboard the Mars 2020 mission. Cost The MMRTG cost an estimated to manufacture and to research and develop. For comparison the production and deployment of the GPHS-RTG was approximately .

It opened on the dismantled Tank Road mainline in 1903, was rebuilt on the current Singapore–Johor Bahru KTM Intercity mainline in 1932, until the Jurong Line shut down and it was a crossing loop station in the late 1940s until closure. The station was a freight interchange for the now defunct Jurong Line from 1965 to the early 1990s.  History  This station was the second to carry the name Bukit Timah and it was built on the new Deviation line from Bukit Batok to Tanjong Pagar in 1932. The original Bukit Timah Railway Station was a wooden construction at Pei Wah Avenue on the 1903 line from Woodlands to Singapore (River Valley Road) via Newton. The Singapore station was replaced in 1907 when a new station was built at Tank Road and the line extended to Pasir Panjang, the old station at River Valley road became a goods only station incorporated into the later expanded Tank Road complex.http://searail.malayanrailways.com/Singapore/SRhistory.htm When the line to Tanjong Pagar opened all passenger traffic on the line to Tank Road ceased and the old Bukit Timah Station was closed along with all the other stations on the old line which was closed to all traffic and lifted within a few years. The section from Tank Road to Tanjong Pagar continued for a short while to clear out all the freight and the section from Tanjong Pagar to Pasir Panjang was taken over by the Singapore Harbour Board. Passenger traffic continued from the new Bukit Timah station until 1965 when Singapore left Malaysia. after which customs and immigration facilities were set up at Tanjong Pagar. Previously they had been carried out on the train at Johore Bahru during a lengthy stop. The station is built in the style of traditional small town stations. Workers of the railways constituted of mainly Tamils and Malays from Malaysia, and were given much work privileges which include free medical facilities for themselves and their families. The station served as a commodities transport linkage for the then heavily industrialized Bukit Timah to other stations, allowing goods to be produced and transported efficiently. Numerous houses could be found along the vicinity of the railways. These houses ranges from typical metal sheds that provides services the railway staff's automobile needs to brick houses lived by residents. This station was between Tanjong Pagar railway station at the southern end of Singapore island and Woodlands Train Checkpoint at the northern end. It was a crossing loop station and signalling control house. The locomotive and two passenger coaches of a KTM train bound for Kuala Lumpur derailed near the Bukit Timah station just after 8am on 9 November 2010. None of the 60 passengers on board were injured. As a result of the derailment, all KTM train services from Singapore on the day of the incident were cancelled, southbound services terminated at JB Sentral and services the next day were rescheduled. The station, along with the line between Woodlands at the northern edge of Singapore and Tanjong Pagar at the southern end, closed on 1 July 2011. Following the cessation, Singapore has only approximately a kilometre of main railway line, from Woodlands to Johor Bahru across the Straits of Johor. The station was gazetted as a conserved building on 27 May 2011. Following closure, the railway track between Tanjong Pagar and Woodlands was removed. A few metres of track have been left between the platforms at Bukit Timah, as well as the iron bridge across Bukit Timah Road, immediately to the north of the station.

Since their formation, they have often featured a rotating line-up of tour players, due to members of the band often touring with other music acts. Singer/guitarist Ryan Young has noted that having different musicians helps keep the band fresh. Though since 2013 the line up has remained more consistent. History According to the No Idea website, the band had planned to release The '69 Sound, a second singles collection of more recent split 7\\" material. However, this has since been refuted by No Idea, who commented saying \\"This thing will never happen.\\" On September 10, 2008, Off With Their Heads self-released a music video for \\"Fuck This, I'm Out\\" In late 2009, the band was chosen as one of Beyond Race Magazine's \\"50 Emerging Artists,\\" resulting in a spot in the publication's No. 11 issue (with Bodega Girls and J. Cole on the cover), as well as an exclusive Q&A; for the magazine's site. In February 2010, it was announced that Off With Their Heads signed to Epitaph Records, with a new record due for June 1 of that year. After Ryan Young suffered a nervous breakdown, the band dropped off of a Canadian Tour with The Flatliners in late 2013. The band took extended time from touring and only played sporadic shows over the course of 2014, later returning to the road in 2015. In 2016 Ryan Young and Polydoros embarked on an acoustic tour in support of their acoustic album \\"Won't Be Missed\\" In August 2019 the band released their fourth full-length album \\"Be Good\\"and a nation wide tour followed, many dates which were cancled due to the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. The band announced in May 2020 that due to the Covid-19 pandemic they would not be playing anymore live shows in 2020. In May 2020 the band put out their second acoustic album \\"Character\\" which features old and new Off With Their Heads songs as well as covers performed by a once again changed OWTH lineup. =Line-up= While the line-up has never been stable, in addition to Ryan Young, the band also always included Justin Francis for most of its history. Though Francis eventually stopped touring with OWTH, he continued to write and record songs as the band's drummer and had played on every Off With Their Heads album through 2013’s “Home.” Similarly, Zack Gontard (who joined in 2006) no longer toured with the band, he remained their guitarist (and backing vocalist) for the purpose of recording through 2013. 2019's “Be Good” is the first album not to feature contributions from the pair. OWTH's current guitarist (since 2013) is John Polydoros. Their current drummer (since 2018) is Kyle Manning. Nate Gangelhoff had been the band's studio bassist from the recording of \\"Hospitals\\" through to the recording of \\"In Desolation\\" but was replaced by touring bassist, Robbie Swartwood, when the band recorded 2013's \\"Home.\\" =Anxious and Angry= In March 2014 Ryan Young launched a podcast and online retail store titled Anxious and Angry. The podcast usually consists of interviews with musicians, writers, comedians and others as well as answering fan submitted questions usually relating to mental health. The overall theme of the podcast is mental health though the interviews do often provide information, stories, and history about the guest. The Anxious and Angry online retail store carries music, apparel, art, and other items from Off With Their Heads, as well as several other artists. It also serves as the exclusive distributor of the Anxious and Angry \\"flexi singles\\".

While they were driving back to the venue, the driver unknowingly hit the victim, Desiree Evancio, as she attempted to cross the street where she was dragged under the trailer being towed by the vehicle. Reports have stated, the driver was given a breathalyzer test, detained, interviewed, and released shortly afterward. A few days later, police stated: \\"We can confirm that new evidence indicates the victim walked between the van and cargo trailer as it was stopped in traffic.\\" A police spokesperson added there was \\"a degree of alcohol impairment\\" but did not speak to whether the driver had exceeded the legal limit. Investigators were still working to determine \\"what role, if any, that alcohol impairment had\\" in the incident. Evancio suffered extensive life-altering injuries and has undergone numerous surgeries. Doctors prognosticate that she will remain in hospital for six months to one year; a GoFundMe account is seeking to raise $1 million for associated costs.

The tradition since Aristotle has defined a human being as animal rationale (a rational animal). However, Cassirer claimed that man's outstanding characteristic is not in his metaphysical or physical nature, but rather in his work. Humanity cannot be known directly, but has to be known through the analysis of the symbolic universe that man has created historically. Thus man should be defined as animal symbolicum (a symbol-making or symbolizing animal). On this basis, Cassirer sought to understand human nature by exploring symbolic forms in all aspects of a human being's experience. His work is represented in his three-volume Philosophie der Symbolischen Formen (1923–9, translated as The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms) and is summarized in his An Essay on Man. W. J. T. Mitchell used this term in his essay on \\"representation\\" to say that > \\"man, for many philosophers both ancient and modern, is the > \\"representational animal,\\" homo symbolicum , the creature whose distinctive > character is the creation and manipulation of signs - things that stand for > or take the place of something else.\\"McLaughlin, T. & Lentricchia, F. > (1990).

Lipov, M.D. (born 1958) is a physician researcher and board- certified anesthesiologist who specializes in intervention-based pain management in the Chicago area. He is best known for his treatment of post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using the stellate ganglion block (SGB). The injection-based technique \\"seems to 'reboot' the body's sympathetic system and may help to reset a PTSD patient's overreaction to stimuli — their 'fight or flight' response—by resetting the sympathetic nervous system and central nervous system to the pre trauma state.. In 2016, the Pentagon approved funding for a study at three Army medical centers, citing SGB’s potential to be a huge game changer for many affected people with PTSD, whether from combat, sexual assault or other trauma. In 2017, the U.S. Army commissioned the first large-scale randomized trial of the procedure. Published in 2019, an Army-funded study, conducted by RTI International, confirmed that SGB was more than two times as effective compared to a placebo in relieving PTSD symptoms. Background  Born in the Soviet-controlled Ukraine, Lipov and his family emigrated to the United States in 1973. Once settled in Chicago, his father Gregory, a cardiovascular surgeon, and his mother Mary, an endocrinologist, were among the first group of physicians to take care of local Russian émigrés. Both Lipov and his older brother Sergei went on to have careers in medicine as adults.  Education  A Frances Parker School graduate, Lipov received his bachelor's in biochemistry from Northwestern University in 1980. A medical degree from Northwestern University followed in 1984, and Lipov moved to Cook County Hospital/University of Illinois for a surgical residency. He spent two years in an anesthesiology residency at the University of Illinois before completing his training at Rush St Luke's with advanced training in pain management. Pain management research & treatment Lipov's PTSD research earned him an invitation to testify before the U.S. House Committee on Veteran's Affairs in 2010. His work also garnered references from former Congressman Rahm Emanuel, then Senator Barack Obama, and Senator Richard Durbin, among others. President Obama wrote: \\"There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that PTSD is afflicting a growing number of our heroic service members. [It] is important to consider any new approaches that may hold potential for helping our service members get the care they need.\\" Lipov's scholarly research and interests include the development of new approaches for pain conditions, and old approaches for new indications. He has developed a new stimulator approach called the \\"Hybrid Stimulator\\" for back and leg pain. He was also the first to report a successful use of stellate ganglion block for hot flashes and PTSD. Lipov has authored over 40 medical publications, including journal articles, book chapters and abstracts, as well as two theoretical papers explaining the mechanisms of the effects observed in the controversial and non-peer reviewed journal Medical Hypotheses. His \\"unified theory\\" explains the prolonged effects of local anesthetic placed on the stellate ganglion resolving complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). It also predicts the positive effect of SGB on estrogen depletion, hot flashes, PTSD and other conditions. Lipov has made numerous media appearances relating to his innovations in the treatment of chronic pain. Many have focused on state- of-the-art disk treatments, implantable neuro-stimulators for lower back pain and treatment of back and leg pain after surgery. His recent focus has been hot flash treatments and PTSD due to the lack of other effective treatments.  Personal life  Lipov lives with his wife and son, who co-authored The Adventures of Captain Heart with him at the age of 4. The book explains how three-to-seven year-olds can maintain a healthy heart.

History During the Middle Ages, Jabłonna was the property of the Bishops of Płock, who built a summer residence here in the 15th century. In 1773 the brother of the King Stanisław August - Michał Poniatowski, then Bishop of Płock and later the primate of Poland, bought the property in Jabłonna with the intention of turning it into an elegant palace-and-park residential complex. In 1774 he commissioned the royal architect, Dominik Merlini, to design the new residence. The construction of a three-building complex was proposed: a one-storey palace, which was intended to be the residence of the owner, was to be situated in the middle and flanked on both sides by separate three-storey pavilions. The ballroom inside the Jablonna PalaceA scenic English-style park was developed in the 1770s and 1780s, based on the design of architect Szymon Bogumił Zug. The same architect also constructed a series of pavilions, of which three still remain today: the Grotto, the Orangerie and the Chinese Pavilion. Originally, the central palace combined the austerity of the classical style with the baroque picturesqueness. Over the next 40 years the buildings were extensively remodelled and added to, coinciding with a number of changes of ownership. In 1837 the palace was rebuilt according to the design of Henryk Marconi. Jabłonna Palace was owned by the Potocki family until 1945. In 1944 the palace was burnt by the German army. Since 1953, Jabłonna has been owned by the Polish Academy of Sciences. Under its auspices the palace was transformed into the conference and recreational centre. The reconstruction of the palace was executed according to the design of Mieczysław Kuźma, and the reconstruction of the park according to the design of Gerard Ciołek. In the course of this renovation, the central part of the palace was restored to look as it did at the end of the 18th century, while its side parts, added in the first half of the 19th century, retained their original appearance. The furnishing and decoration of the palace interior was completed after 1945. The representative halls and chambers of the palace were decorated with old furniture and paintings from the end of the 18th and the first half of the 19th centuries. Current use The Palace is currently used as a convention center, training center and is often used for weddings and wedding receptions. It includes a ballroom, dining area and hotel rooms. Concerts, recitals, art exhibitions and scientific shows are held at the venue. The park is also open to the public.

A hospital train is a railway train with carriages equipped for the provision of healthcare. Historically this has ranged from trains equipped to transport wounded soldiers, with basic nursing and first aid facilities on board, to fully equipped mobile medical centres, sometimes including operating theatres and nursing wards. HistoryOrigins= Balaclava, where the first hospital train operated, during the Crimean War. Photograph by Roger Fenton. The first hospital train was built during the Crimean War in the 1850s. Poorly operated logistical supply networks and inadequate health provisions for the British army encamped around the Russian port of Sevastopol caused a public outcry in England. To alleviate these problems, the Grand Crimean Central Railway was initially built by a partnership of English railway contractors led by Samuel Morton Petoin 1855, to supply ammunition and provisions to Allied soldiers. Within three weeks of the arrival of the fleet carrying materials and men the railway had started to run and in seven weeks of track had been completed. The railway was a major factor leading to the success of the siege. The line was surveyed by Donald Campbell. Although the railway's primary function was the supply of armaments and equipment, the train was also used for the transport of the wounded. The first such instance of this occurred on April 2, 1855, when the train was used to carry the sick and injured from the plateau down to the dock at Balaclava. Towards and during the second winter, the supplies carried by the railway were different. The siege had ended, carriage of ammunition was less important, and the supplies related more to the accommodation and comfort of the troops. These included huts to replace tents, clothing, food, books and medical supplies. Following the completion of the Sardinian branch, the railway had reached its limit. In all, it measured about plus a few miles of sidings and loops. =Expansion= A French Red Cross train bearing sick and wounded soldiers to Paris. Departure of the hospital train from Lübeck on October 27, 1914 Hospital trains were subsequently used during the Franco-Austrian War, the American Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War. They were also used extensively during colonial campaigns, notably in the Anglo-Zulu War. However, these hospital trains remained primarily as troop trains, with the passengers restricted to the wounded and dying. They had little or nothing in terms of onboard medical facilities, although nurses traveled with the wounded and the carriages of the trains were painted with red crosses to indicate their humanitarian role and to prevent enemy attack. It was during the First World War that trains began to be used as mobile medical facilities along the Western Front and other subsidiary theatres of the War. Ambulance trains were organised by the Royal Army Medical Corps with onboard surgical wards and essential medical supplies. Trains were used to evacuate over 100,000 British casualties from the battlefield at Flanders in one month of 1914 alone. These trains were able to connect with hospital ships at French channel ports in order to repatriate wounded British soldiers back to England. There are numbers of extant journal entries from those who experienced the hospital trains of this era, many being referred to as \\"Great White Hospital Trains\\", as the carriages were often painted white or red and white.See here for one example of an extensive journal entry from the first world war hospital trains in Europe. Hospital trains were used on a large scale during the Second World War by all the major combatants and, to a more limited extent, during the Korean War. By that time, however, mobile motor transport and aerial evacuation supplanted the train as the dominant form of mobile medical provision on the battlefield. Currently operating hospital trainsRussian Hospital Trains= Russian local government and state rail services operate five trains since 2010 during specific times of the year, each one carrying medical staff from the regional cities and traveling remote regions, e.g. in Siberia. =The Sovereign Military Order of Malta= The Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM), which is a sovereign entity (similar to an independent country, though with no sovereign land), has a history of operating hospital trains through its military branch, known as the Military Corps of the Order. The operation of such trains reached its peak in the Second World War, but SMOM continues to operate such trains today.Ordine di Malta - Sito Ufficiale - Archivio Fotografico These include trains of carriages to provide shelter to refugees, with basic medical provision, and more technically equipped trains, on which a wide range of medical services may be provided. = Dr. Vagón in Mexico = Dr. Vagón in his journey across Mexico. Owned by Fundación Grupo México, in collaboration with Ferromex, Dr. Vagón is a train hospital which offers free, complete healthcare for hard to reach communities in Mexico. Dr. Vagón has made a big impact in communities where health care was not available or was insufficient. Dr. Vagón is 435 meters long and has 17 fully equipped coaches, with 5 medical offices, bedrooms, dining room, pharmacy and an operation room, among others. Dr. Vagón has a permanent crew of 64 employees made up of medical and administrative personnel. Thanks to this infrastructure and human resources, the train can care for more than 500 people a day providing services as general checkups and specialized examinations in ophthalmology, dermatology, pediatrics, geriatrics, and gynecology. It also offers other medical services such as laboratory studies, X-rays studies, among other. Dr. Vagón also provides eyeglasses, hearing aids and free medication. Having acquired an operating room in late 2019, the Dr. Vagón can carry out ambulatory surgeries. In addition to offering health services, it offers courses and hosts workshops for attendees, as well as showing family-friendly movies. =Lifeline Express of India= The Lifeline Express is an example of a modern hospital train of a highly technologically advanced type. Operated by the Impact India Foundation since 1991, these trains have had a profound impact on Indian rural healthcare provision.See the Impact India website here . Operating in India, across the extensive network of the Indian Railways, the Lifeline trains (known colloquially as \\"magic trains\\") move from town to town, remaining in a siding or platform at each town's railway station for perhaps a week or so, and providing advanced medical services (often beyond the capabilities of local medical centres) to those who apply for them, through a simple vetting or triage process, which ensures services are provided to those most likely to benefit. These trains include nursing wards, and full-scale operating theatres. They have resident medical and nursing staff, but for surgical procedures they rely upon the charitable provision of time and talents by Indian surgeons who spend some of their free time on board the trains for that purpose. =Chinese eye hospital trains= The state-owned China Railway company currently operates four eye hospital trains, the fourth and latest being operated through the CSR Corporation, and having entered service in early 2009 for the benefit of residents of the Sichuan Province. A range of ophthalmic surgeries, including the common cataract removal operation, can be provided free of charge on board the trains. = Phelophepa Trains in South Africa = The Phelophea trains have been founded 1994 and are sponsored by companies and private donors.

In 1895, rancher S.G. Umbarger leased the site from the Houston and Great Northern Railroad survey lands. He purchased it two years later and established several businesses that catered to area settlers and travelers. The Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway established a switch near Umbarger's ranch in 1898. Although Umbarger sold his ranch and moved to nearby Canyon in 1900, the settlement retained its name. As more land was made available to homesteaders, the community slowly began to grow. In 1902, a group of German Catholics from the Schulenburg area in south central Texas settled in Umbarger. The migration was pioneered by Pius Friemel. A general store that housed a post office opened soon after, followed by the creation of a public school district in 1904. Around the same time a Catholic missionary, Father Joseph Reisdorff, worked to attract other German families to the community. In 1908, both he and John Hutson, an Englishman who had speculated in land holdings around Umbarger, filed separate plans of settlement. The subsequent friction led to the building of two separate Catholic churches. Swiss immigrants settled in Umbarger from 1911 to the late 1920s. By that time, the business district was centered in Reisdorff's portion of Umbarger on the north side of the railroad tracks. Under the leadership of Father John J. Dolje, St. Mary's Church was moved to its present-day location. Eighty people lived in Umbarger in 1930. The population grew to 150 by 1940. Umbarger's public school district consolidated with Canyon's in 1964. Its location near Amarillo and Canyon as well as its proximity to Buffalo Lake have contributed to the survival and growth of the community. Although it remains unincorporated, Umbarger is home to over 300 residents, several businesses, and a functioning post office (zip code: 79091).Zip Code Lookup Attractions St. Mary's Church in Umbarger Each November, Umbarger hosts an annual German Sausage Festival at St. Mary's Parish Hall. During WW2 some Italian prisoners of war from nearby Hereford painted murals in the Catholic church at Umbarger.

Biology The moths are on wing from May to July, and in southern Europe there is a partial second generation in August and September. The larvae feed on oak (Quercus species), preferring new growth and saplings and have also been found on elm (Ulmus species). Pupation takes place, through the winter, in a cocoon on the ground. Distribution It is found in southern and central Europe up to the Caucasus. In the north, the range extends to Latvia and Lithuania. In the east, the range extends through southern Russia to the Urals. It also occurs on the larger Mediterranean islands (including Cyprus), in North Africa and Israel and Asia Minor. Sometimes it is observed in England as a migrant. In the Alps it rises to 800 meters. The moth is found in areas with oak trees, such as oak and mixed forests, alluvial forests, bushy heaths and parklands. ReferencesExternal links * Lepiforum e.V.

Hill succeeded his father as Master of the Shropshire Fox Hounds, and refounded the Hawkstone Otter Hunt Club in 1870, becoming its Master and continuing until 1891. The Hawkstone Otter Hunt was originally started about 1800 by the 1st Viscount and maintained within the family. Personal life Hill was twice married. He married firstly, in London, Mary Madax, daughter of William Madax of Gosport, Hampshire, on 3 May 1855. Before their marriage she worked as his mother's still room maid and for some time the marriage was unacknowledged. She died in 1874, having borne him two sons, Rowland Richard and Francis William Clegg-Hill, later respectively 4th and 5th Viscounts Hill. He married secondly, in April 1876, Isabella Elizabeth Wynn, daughter of Spencer Bulkeley Wynn, 3rd Baron Newborough, of Rug, Caernarvonshire. The marriage took place at Rug Chapel, and it was claimed that over a thousand people were unable to get into the church to attend the service. Isabella survived her husband, dying in 1908. The couple had one daughter and three sons, the eldest of whom, Charles Rowland Clegg- Hill, later succeeded as 6th Viscount Hill. Lord Hill died at Hawkstone Hall in March 1895, aged 61, and was buried in the family vault at the parish church in Hodnet. He was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son, Rowland Richard Clegg-Hill.

Founded in 1822 in Schwenningen, the company headquarters has been in Hamburg since 2002. History left forced labor worker from Poland In 1883 Jakob Kienzle married into the Schlenker family and henceforward he contributed to the expansion of the company. In 1899, 162,000 watches and alarm clocks were made per annum. The name of the company was changed to Schlenker & Kienzle. From 1894 onwards the weight and the cost of alarm clocks and wall clocks was significantly reduced by the introduction of the \\"American System\\" with standardised individual components and perforated plates. This process was highly innovative at that time. In 1897 Jakob Kienzle became the sole owner, with the name of the company later being changed to Kienzle. Watch production was continuously extended and modernised, and international activities expanded. In the following years branches in Milan, Paris and London were established.Lehmhaus, Schmidt and Welchering, p. 12 In 1902 Kienzle launched the time stamp clock on the market, followed by inexpensive pocket watches, travelling clocks and wristwatches for ladies. The first clocks for automobiles were also made at that time. The so-called \\"Strapazier-Armbanduhr\\" was presented in 1931. This watch is extremely resilient because of its special construction. The watch model becomes a popular product, with 25 million examples sold.Lehmhaus, Schmidt and Welchering, p. 14 At the end of the 1930s, Kienzle started the manufacture of two table clocks in the upper price segment: the Zodiac Clock and the World Time Clock. After the Second World War Kienzle continued production with established articles and new products like a parking meter equipped with the latest technology. During the Second World War, the company augmented the employed work force with slave labour from Poland and other conquered areas. The factory produced and supplied a range of timing instruments and watches for German and Axis armed forces. These included chronograph 8-day cockpit clocks for Messerschmitt and Heinkel aircraft as well as wrist and pocket watches for general purchase, and for the Wehrmacht and the Luftwaffe. In 1956 the so-called \\"Volksautomatik\\" was introduced to the market. Energy is provided by a rotor that winds in both directions and instead of steel pins the lever is fitted with ruby pins.Lehmhaus, Schmidt and Welchering, pp. 19 and 21 In the 1960s, Kienzle produced dashboard clocks for Rolls-Royce and Bentley. Both Series 1 Silver Shadow, and Bentley T models were fitted with a Kienzle clocks. In the 1960s and 1970s Kienzle became a market leader in Germany. In 1972 the first solar watch, \\"Heliomat\\", was produced as well as the first quartz movements.Lehmhaus, Schmidt and Welchering, p. 32 In the following years Kienzle was the first company to present a quartz travel alarm clock.Lehmhaus, Schmidt and Welchering, p. 21 In 1986 Kienzle developed the first solar watch with light conditions and a polycrystalline solar element. In the early 1990s, Kienzle developed the most water-resistant watch in the world which was resistant up to 12,000 metres. They also developed the world's first radio- controlled \\"atomic\\" alarm clock with an analogue alarm setting. In 1996 a new radio-controlled movement was perfected: the smallest dual-motor, radio- controlled movement with the fastest setting system. This movement corrects to the right time within just five minutes.Lehmhaus, Schmidt and Welchering, pp. 19ff Present In 1997 Kienzle was taken over by the Highway Holdings Group. But only five years later in 2002, Kienzle returned to Germany with the establishment of Kienzle AG. The company employs over 450 workers in its new factory. Since that time, the headquarters is located in Hamburg and Kienzle returns to former levels of success.Lehmhaus, Schmidt and Welchering, p. 35 The company purchases the worldwide brand and distribution rights and began with the development and fabrication of three new watch collections in different price segments.Lehmhaus, Schmidt and Welchering, p. 36 In 2008 Kienzle moved into the current headquarters, a time honored merchant's house in Hamburg-Harvestehude, which perfectly represents the company and its values: quality, tradition and innovation.Armband Uhren.

It consists of a constructor which either is empty (often named \`None\` or \`Nothing\`), or which encapsulates the original data type \`A\` (often written \`Just A\` or \`Some A\`). A distinct, but related concept outside of functional programming, which is popular in object-oriented programming, is called nullable types (often expressed as \`A?\`). The core difference between option types and nullable types is that option types support nesting (\`Maybe (Maybe A)\` ≠ \`Maybe A\`), while nullable types do not (\`String??\` = \`String?\`). Theoretical aspects In type theory, it may be written as: A^{?} = A + 1. This expresses the fact that for a given set of values in A, an option type adds exactly one additional value (the empty value) to the set of valid values for A. This is reflected in programming by the fact that in languages having tagged unions, option types can be expressed as the tagged union of the encapsulated type plus a unit type. In the Curry–Howard correspondence, option types are related to the annihilation law for ∨: x∨1=1. An option type can also be seen as a collection containing either one or zero elements. The option type is also a monad where: return = Just -- Wraps the value into a maybe Nothing >>= f = Nothing -- Fails if the previous monad fails (Just x) >>= f = f x -- Succeeds when both monads succeed The monadic nature of the option type is useful for efficiently tracking failure and errors. Names and definitions In different programming languages, the option type has various names and definitions. * In Agda, it is named with variants and . * In C++17 it is defined as the template class , can be used to create an empty option. (Might break monad laws due to the heavy overloading of constructors.) * In C#, it is defined as but is generally written as . (Breaks monad laws.) * In Coq, it is defined as . * In Elm, it is named , and defined as . * In Haskell, it is named , and defined as . * In Idris, it is defined as . * In Java, since version 8, it is defined as parameterized final class . (Breaks monad laws (map is implemented incorrectly).) * In Julia, it is named . (However, this has been deprecated.) * In Kotlin, it is defined as . (Breaks monad laws (does not support nesting).) * In OCaml, it is defined as . * In Rust, it is defined as . * In Scala, it is defined as , a type extended by and . * In Standard ML, it is defined as . * In Swift, it is defined as but is generally written as .  Examples  Ada = Ada does not implement option-types directly, however it provides discriminated types which can be used to parameterize a record. To implement a Option type, a Boolean type is used as the discriminant; the following example provides a generic to create an option type from any non-limited constrained type: Generic \\\\-- Any constrained & non-limited type. Type Element_Type is private; Package Optional_Type is \\\\-- When the discriminant, Has_Element, is true there is an element field, \\\\-- when it is false, there are no fields (hence the null keyword). Type Optional( Has_Element : Boolean ) is record case Has_Element is when False => Null; when True => Element : Element_Type; end case; end record; end Optional_Type; = Scala = Scala implements \`Option\` as a parameterized type, so a variable can be an \`Option\`, accessed as follows: object Main { // This function uses pattern matching to deconstruct \`Option\`s def computeV1(opt: Option[Int]): String = opt match { case Some(x) => s\\"The value is: $x\\" case None => \\"No value\\" } // This function uses the built-in \`fold\` method def computeV2(opt: Option[Int]): String = opt.fold(\\"No value\\")(x => s\\"The value is: $x\\") def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = { // Define variables that are \`Option\`s of type \`Int\` val full = Some(42) val empty: Option[Int] = None // computeV1(full) -> The value is: 42 println(s\\"computeV1(full) -> \${computeV1(full)}\\") // computeV1(empty) -> No value println(s\\"computeV1(empty) -> \${computeV1(empty)}\\") // computeV2(full) -> The value is: 42 println(s\\"computeV2(full) -> \${computeV2(full)}\\") // computeV2(empty) -> No value println(s\\"computeV2(empty) -> \${computeV2(empty)}\\") } } Two main ways to use an \`Option\` value exist. The first, not the best, is the pattern matching, as in the first example. The second, the best practice is a monadic approach, as in the second example. In this way, a program is safe, as it can generate no exception or error (e.g., by trying to obtain the value of an \`Option\` variable that is equal to \`None\`). Thus, it essentially works as a type-safe alternative to the null value. = OCaml = OCaml implements \`Option\` as a parameterized variant type. \`Option\`s are constructed and deconstructed as follows: (* This function uses pattern matching to deconstruct \`option\`s *) let compute_v1 = function  Some x -> \\"The value is: \\" ^ string_of_int x  None -> \\"No value\\" (* This function uses the built-in \`fold\` function *) let compute_v2 = Option.fold ~none:\\"No value\\" ~some:(fun x -> \\"The value is: \\" ^ string_of_int x) let () = (* Define variables that are \`option\`s of type \`int\` *) let full = Some 42 in let empty = None in (* compute_v1 full -> The value is: 42 *) print_endline (\\"compute_v1 full -> \\" ^ compute_v1 full); (* compute_v1 empty -> No value *) print_endline (\\"compute_v1 empty -> \\" ^ compute_v1 empty); (* compute_v2 full -> The value is: 42 *) print_endline (\\"compute_v2 full -> \\" ^ compute_v2 full); (* compute_v2 empty -> No value *) print_endline (\\"compute_v2 empty -> \\" ^ compute_v2 empty) = F# = // This function uses pattern matching to deconstruct \`option\`s let compute_v1 = function  Some x -> sprintf \\"The value is: %d\\" x  None -> \\"No value\\" // This function uses the built-in \`fold\` function let compute_v2 = Option.fold (fun _ x -> sprintf \\"The value is: %d\\" x) \\"No value\\" // Define variables that are \`option\`s of type \`int\` let full = Some 42 let empty = None // compute_v1 full -> The value is: 42 compute_v1 full > printfn \\"compute_v1 full -> %s\\" // compute_v1 empty -> No value compute_v1 empty > printfn \\"compute_v1 empty -> %s\\" // compute_v2 full -> The value is: 42 compute_v2 full > printfn \\"compute_v2 full -> %s\\" // compute_v2 empty -> No value compute_v2 empty > printfn \\"compute_v2 empty -> %s\\" = Haskell = \\\\-- This function uses pattern matching to deconstruct \`Maybe\`s computeV1 :: Maybe Int -> String computeV1 (Just x) = \\"The value is: \\" ++ show x computeV1 Nothing = \\"No value\\" \\\\-- This function uses the built-in \`foldl\` function computeV2 :: Maybe Int -> String computeV2 = foldl (\\\\\\\\_ x -> \\"The value is: \\" ++ show x) \\"No value\\" main :: IO () main = do \\\\-- Define variables that are \`Maybe\`s of type \`Int\` let full = Just 42 let empty = Nothing \\\\-- computeV1 full -> The value is: 42 putStrLn $ \\"computeV1 full -> \\" ++ computeV1 full \\\\-- computeV1 full -> No value putStrLn $ \\"computeV1 empty -> \\" ++ computeV1 empty \\\\-- computeV2 full -> The value is: 42 putStrLn $ \\"computeV2 full -> \\" ++ computeV2 full \\\\-- computeV2 full -> No value putStrLn $ \\"computeV2 empty -> \\" ++ computeV2 empty = Swift = // This function uses a \`switch\` statement to deconstruct \`Optional\`s func computeV1(_ opt: Int?) -> String { switch opt { case .some(let x): return \\"The value is: \\\\\\\\(x)\\" case .none: return \\"No value\\" } } // This function uses optional binding to deconstruct \`Optional\`s func computeV2(_ opt: Int?) -> String { if let x = opt { return \\"The value is: \\\\\\\\(x)\\" } else { return \\"No value\\" } } // Define variables that are \`Optional\`s of type \`Int\` let full: Int?

History  The earliest incarnation of the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society was the IRE Professional Group on Human Factors in Electronics, formed in 1958. The Group would later change its name to IEEE Professional Technical Group on Human Factors in Electronics (1963), IEEE Human Factors in Electronics Group (1964), Man-Machine Systems Group (1968), Systems, Man and Cybernetics Group (1970), and finally Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society (1972). 3 areas of IEEE SMC technical activities IEEE SMCS has fostered many different technical committees which has made it a sort of technical committee “incubator.” These technical committees have addressed a number of diverse topics including, but not limited to, electrotechnology, environmental quality, national priorities, health care, decision science, optimization, learning systems, pattern recognition, and biocybernetics. A number of IEEE SMCS technical interest groups eventually became separate IEEE entities in their own right. For example, robotics and automation special interest groups merged to become the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, and the neural network special interest group became the IEEE Neural Networks Council.  Fields of interest  The Field of Interest (FoI) of the SMCS includes: * \\"Integration of the theories of communication, control, cybernetics, stochastics, optimization and system structure towards the formation of a general theory of systems;\\" * \\"Development of systems engineering technology including problem definition methods, modeling, and simulation, methods of system experimentation, human factors engineering data and methods, systems design techniques and test and evaluation methods;\\" * \\"Application of the above at both hardware and software levels to the analysis and design of biological, ecological, socio-economic, social service, computer information, and operational man-machine systems\\". Interaction among technically diverse professional colleagues is stimulating and invites new thinking that single disciplines, and employment alone, do not provide. This positions SMCS to effectively engage the emerging nature of the non-deterministic complex challenges that are typical of rapidly evolving post-industrial society.  Technical Activities  IEEE SMCS’s three technical areas (TA) promote initiatives in support of the FoI: * Systems Science and Engineering—Focuses on systematics formulation, interpretation, analysis and modelling of issues and decision-making opportunities for large and complex systems. * Human-Machine Systems—Focuses on organizational interactions, cognitive ergonomics, and human information processing. * Cybernetics—Focuses on communication and control across machines or among machine, human and organizations. This touches a very broad area including, but not limited to, computational intelligence, computer vision, neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, fuzzy systems and machine learning. Technical committees (TCs) in each of the technical areas offer Society members the opportunity to collaborate with colleagues on topics of mutual interest. The committees evolve in response to societal needs, member interests, and new technology opportunities. Technical committees typically bring members together from government, academia and industry from around the globe. TCs are distributed among three broad areas and a list of available TCs can be found on IEEE SMCS webpage under the following areas. * Technical committees in Systems Science and Engineering * Technical committees in Human- Machine systems * Technical committees in Cybernetics  Publications  IEEE SMCS previously published three peer-reviewed journals: \\"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics\\", Part A, Part B, and Part C. Part A is devoted to systems and humans, and Part B to cybernetics . In 2012, the journals were reconfigured into the current offering. IEEE SMCS currently publishes peer- reviewed journals relevant to SMCS goals and its FoI in the areas of systems science and engineering, human-machine systems, cybernetics and computational social systems: \\"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems,\\" \\"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems,\\" \\"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics\\", and \\"IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems.\\" * IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems: Topics relevant to systems engineering, accepting articles in the areas of issue formulation, analysis, modelling, decision making, and issue interpretation in all lifecycle phases for large systems. It also accepts articles addressing systems management, systems engineering processes and any method that aims to improve systems engineering methods that include optimization, modelling, and simulation. * IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems: Topics relevant to the area of human-machine systems, accepting articles covering human systems, human organizational interaction which includes cognitive ergonomics, system test and assessment, and human information processing concerns in systems and organizations. * IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics: Computational approaches in the area of cybernetics, accepting papers on topics relevant to control and communication across machines, or machine, human and organizations. Scope includes areas utilizing different computational methods as long as they contribute to the theme of cybernetics or demonstrate an application of cybernetics principles. * IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems: Modelling, simulation, analysis and understanding of social systems from a quantitative and/or computational perspective. This Transactions considers “systems” as man-man, man-machine and machine-machine organizations and adversarial situations. It accepts papers that handle modelling of the dynamics of social systems, and methodologies for computation in the domain of socio-cultural and behavior aspects of systems. Articles in the domain of social network dynamics, social intelligence and cognition, social systems design and computational behaviour modelling and their applications are also accepted. IEEE SMCS also regularly publishes \\"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Magazine\\" and an eNewsletter.  Conferences  IEEE SMCS arranges and sponsors its flagship conference, the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, every year. This conference provides an international forum for researchers and practitioners to report the latest innovations and developments in the relevant fields, and exchange ideas in fields relevant to SMCS. In addition, the Society sponsors, financially and technically, a range of annual conferences around the world that focuses on its Field of Interest. The process to obtain conference sponsorship from SMCS can be found on IEEE SMCS website.  Chapters and Communities  While technical committees are global in nature, IEEE SMCS also host many geographical units in the form of chapters which serve as local branches of the SMC Society. These chapters are subdivided into three main regions: * Americas * Europe/Africa * Asia  Membership  IEEE SMCS members enjoy exclusive membership benefits along with exclusive access to eNewsletters and notices. Details of membership can be found in IEEE SMC Membership Catalogue and membership information in IEEE SMCS.  Distinguished Lecturer Program  IEEE SMCS has a Distinguished Lecturer program that allows Society Chapters (its geographical units) to learn about the latest technological developments and applications. The Society has a pool of renowned experts who can be available to deliver these lectures upon request. SMCS shares the cost of a distinguished lecture with the requesting chapter in cases where the lecturers will not receive any honorarium.  Young Professionals  IEEE SMCS runs a Young Professionals Program designed to help its young members to transition from student to professional, so that the Society can serve as the technical home for recent graduates. By participating in IEEE SMCS and its sponsored conferences, young professionals can find researchers and professionals with common interests, gain peer recognition, extend their network, and discover collaborative opportunities. These early involvements can help young professionals to build a successful career.  Women in Engineering  IEEE SMCS places special emphasis on the promotion of female engineers and scientists within its FoI. The Society’s Board of Governors established its liaison to the IEEE Women in Engineering organization to inspire, engage and advance women in Systems, Man, and Cybernetics. The WIE–SMCS committee organizes a series of periodic events and activities to promote the visibility of women leaders and to inspire young girls who want to get involved in engineering.

Background and education Baring was the second son of Sir Thomas Baring, 2nd Baronet, and Mary Ursula, daughter of Charles Sealy. Francis Baring, 1st Baron Northbrook, was his elder brother, and the Right Reverend Charles Baring one of his younger brothers. He was educated at Winchester. Business career As a second son, Thomas was destined for a career in the \\"counting house\\". Beginning at Hope & Co., he did well in Amsterdam, becoming a partner in 1824. Despite the lobbying of Sir Thomas, the opposition of his uncle Alexander kept Thomas from a partnership in Baring Brothers & Co. until 1828. Once installed in London, Thomas sought, during the 1830s and 40s, to use knowledge and connections gained at Hopes to increase the firm's visibility in Europe. Except in Russia, Barings was mostly frustrated in these efforts by more established continental houses like Rothschilds and Hottinguer's. During these same years Thomas, along with younger brother John, spent much time promoting Barings in North America, especially the United States. He made his first trip to the US in 1829 and many more thereafter. Following the death of all three senior Barings in 1848, Thomas and American Joshua Bates became the leading partners in the 1850s. The European troubles of 1848 also contributed to the shift of Barings' attention to the Americas. During this period, Barings was the financial agent for the governments of the US and (along with Glyn, Mills & Co.) Canada. Entering the 1860s, with the ageing Bates becoming progressively less active, and with new young partner Edward 'Ned' Baring not ready for leadership, Thomas and Russell Sturgis (a second American) assumed command. Feeling the need for new blood at Barings, Thomas in 1867 completed a merger with London rival Finlay Hodgson and Co. Senior partner Kirkham Hodgson, a past Governor of the Bank of England, became a Barings partner. In the same year, Thomas' nephew Thomas (Charles) Baring also joined the partnership. While always resistant to heavy involvement in public life, Thomas found time for other finance-related positions, including Chairman of Lloyd's and a director of the Bank of England. Like his father, he was President of the London Institution and s Fellow of the Royal Society Political career Baring entered Parliament for Great Yarmouth in 1835, a seat he held until 1837, and later represented Huntingdon between 1844 and 1873. He was a close associate of Benjamin Disraeli but declined every ministerial post offered to him. Personal life Baring died in November 1873, aged 74.

Norton & Co. in 2007 and quickly became a New York Times bestseller. The Power in the title refers to the United States' military, diplomatic and financial strength to pursue its interests in the Middle East. Faith, in the words of Oren, refers to \\"impact of religion in the shaping of American attitudes and policies toward the Middle East.\\" And fantasy refers to the image Americans themselves shaped of the Middle East. The audiobook version is performed by Norman Dietz.\\"Publisher's Weekly Review\\", Publisher's Weekly, July 30, 2007 Thesis In Oren's narrative, the present resembles the past. The new American republic was immediately forced to formulate a Middle East policy, and the issues were not very different from the issues America faces in the Middle East today. Halkin, Hillel. \\"Power, Faith, and Fantasy by Michael B. Oren .\\" Commentary, January 2007. In Oren's own words: \\"[Contemporary] American policy- makers, it will be shown, wrestled with many of the same challenges in the area faced by their . . . predecessors and similarly strove to reconcile their strategic and ideological interests. Mythic images of the Middle East, meanwhile, remained a mainstay of American popular culture. . . . The objective [of this final section] is to enable Americans to read about the fighting in Iraq and hear the echoes of the Barbary wars and Operation Torch [the code name for the American landing in North Africa in World War II] or to follow presidential efforts to mediate between Palestinians and Israelis and see the shadows of Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.\\" Hillel Halkin, writing in Commentary, finds one aspect of this thesis compelling. He argues, with Oren, that the role of idealism in American foreign policy may be unique. \\"America alone (or so it can be claimed), in addition to pursuing, sometimes ruthlessly, its national interests like any other country, has frequently acted with the best interests of others in mind. One can compile a long list of major American foreign- policy decisions, by no means all of them regarding the Middle East—entering World War I, the Marshall Plan, intervening in Bosnia and Kosovo, etc.—that arguably had, alongside their purely pragmatic calculations, a genuine element of idealism, without which it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to obtain support for them from the American public. More than the citizens of other democracies, Americans really do expect their governments to be a force for good in the world.\\" Oren argues that with regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict, the American tendency to idealism has been reinforced by Christian feelings about the places in which all the major events of the Hebrew and Christian Bibles happened. Oren points out that the sympathy for Judaism felt by many American Christians is historically unique and goes back to the philo- Semitism of the Puritans, who were themselves influenced by 17th-century English Puritanism, which strongly identified with the Biblical Israelites.

Earlier Vatican investigation In 1994, archbishop Edgardo Gabriel Storni (April 6, 1936 – February 20, 2012) was subject to an investigation ordered by the Vatican, led by Monsignor José María Arancibia, after allegations of sexual abuse on 47 young seminarians, who were questioned, together with some of their family members, by Arancibia and a psychologist, at the home of Monsignor Estanislao Karlic in Paraná. Soon after the scandal broke out, in February 1995 Storni employed his contacts with then-Apostolic Nuncio Ubaldo Calabressi to arrange a trip to the Vatican. There he was received and ratified in his post by Pope John Paul II. The investigation was set aside. Book on the affairs In 2002 the book Our Holy Mother, by journalist Olga Wornat, was presented at the Santa Fe Book Fair. The book recounted the history of the accusations against Storni, and mentions an episode of threats against a priest, José Guntern, who had written a letter to the archbishop asking for him to resign on account of his misconduct (sexual activity with a seminarist). According to Guntern, he was taken practically by force to Storni's house and forced to recant and stay silent. Political climate The political climate had changed. While Storni has close relations with members of the local élite, the Catholic Church had been shaken by the wave of abuse allegations in the United States. Storni travelled to Rome on 28 August 2002 where he met the Pope and several other Argentine bishops. Episcopal resignation Storni resigned his post on 1 October 2002 stating that this did not signify guilt. He returned to Argentina and went to live at Los Leones, a large farm and horse ranch owned by Eduardo González Kess near Llambí Campbell, 60 km away from Santa Fe's capital. He then moved to a secluded ecclesiastic residence in La Falda, Córdoba; since he was formally still a bishop, he received a pension paid by the state, as per the financial support of the Church mandated by the Argentine Constitution. Conviction and annulment In 2009, Storni was sentenced to eight years in prison, the minimum term, for sexually abusing seminarian Rubén Descalzo in 1992. Because Storni was over the age of 70, the sentence was served under house arrest at a church property in Cordoba. In 2011, the Criminal Chamber of the Province of Santa Fe ordered the annulment of the judgement. Another Bishop charged On July 15, 2020, it was revealed that Santa Fe Archbishop Sergio Fenoy was criminally charged for attempting to supplant another sex abuse investigation.https://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=47111 See also *Abuse *Child abuse *Child sexual abuse *Religious abuse *Sexual abuse *Sexual misconduct *Spiritual abuse References * Boston Globe - Prelates felled by sex scandals (in English). * LaInsignia.org - Latest news * LaFogata.org - The sex abuse scandal * - Ex-archbishop sentenced in Argentina over sex abuse.

He developed the analytical code to determine suitable frequency ranges for short wave communication by which German forces built-up their long distance communications during World War II. Biography After studies of mathematics and physics in Freiburg and Munich (with Arnold Sommerfeld), under Jonathan Zenneck he wrote a thesis on partial reflection of radio waves in an ionospheric layer. Aware of this Johannes Plendl charged him to serve as adviser for the Shortwave communications of the German Luftwaffe, since 1943 for Navy and Army as well. Rawer's code assumes zig-zag paths between Earth and ionosphere. Monthly predictions take account of day-to-day variations. Long term changes from solar cycles is taken account of by Wolfgang Gleißberg´s prediction method. After the war Yves Rocard, then director of French Navy research, was impressed by Rawer's code.

Villa il Gioiello (\\"The Jewel\\") is a villa in Florence, central Italy, famous for being one of the residences of Galileo Galilei, which he lived in from 1631 until his death in 1642. It is also known as Villa Galileo (not to be confused with the other homes of Galileo found in Florence, which are in Costa San Giorgio, as well as a villa in Bellosguardo). HistoryOrigins= The name Gioiello was given due to its favorable position in the hills of Arcetri, near the Torre del Gallo. It was an elegant home, surrounded by many acres of farmland with a separate house for workers. It is recorded in the cadastre of 1427 to have been owned by Tommaso di Cristofano Masi and his brothers, who later passed it on to the Calderini family in 1525, where it is first mentioned as \\"The Jewel\\". The villa and its estate suffered damages during the siege of Florence in the years 1529 and 1530, whilst the entire area of Arcetri and Pian dei Giullari were occupied by Imperial troops. Calderini I sold it shortly thereafter to the Cavalcanti family, who rebuilt the home with its original simple lines, preserving its elegant look to the present day. =Galileo= Bust of Galileo. This rented residence with its fields, adjoined the monastery where his daughter, Sister Maria Celeste (born Virginia) was a nun. There are 124 remaining letters from Celeste to Galileo (the replies of the scientist were probably destroyed) which were filed after his death (at the State Archive of Florence) in the inventory of property owned by Galileo. Galileo's books are now held in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze and are the subject of a celebratory exhibit: Galileiana 2009. Galileo lived there from 1631; in 1633 the inquisition sentenced him to lifelong house arrest which he served in Il Gioiello from early 1634.Galilei, Galileo at encyclopedia.com, section The Trial of GalileoFlorence - Following in Galileo's tracks at IMSS, section Villa Il Gioiello Despite becoming blind in 1638, he continued to write some of his most significant works. In 1634 he suffered the loss of his favorite daughter, Celeste, but continued to work on Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences (Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche, intorno a due nuove scienze), in which he presented his theories on the strength and resistance of materials and on motion. Shortly after Galileo moved to Arcetri, he received visits from Ferdinando II de' Medici as well as the painter Giusto Sustermans, who painted a portrait of the famous scientist. Other guests were the Ambassador of the Netherlands (Galileo had printed many of his books in Leiden) and the English poet John Milton. He made frequent visits to the students of Villa Castelli, and the young Vincenzo Viviani and Evangelista Torricelli assisted Galileo until his death. = Modern and contemporary times = In the centuries thereafter, the house has had various owners: the Del Soldato Family, whose coat of arms is on the façade, and even the nuns of St. Matthew, for which the \\"Signori Otto\\" (an ancient Florentine magistracy) adorned a plaque on the façade prohibiting “any card or ball game, ruzzola, or any other kind of game\\" with severe penalties if caught. In 1788 Senator Clemente Nelli had affixed a plaque dedicated to Galileo on the façade, and in 1843 a bust of the scientist was placed in a niche by the owners. In the 19th century, the building underwent further changes, especially on the upper floor. Villa il Goiello has been a national monument since 1920 and was in private hands until 1942, when it was purchased by the state. It underwent a long restoration from 1986 to 2008, and today it is used for scientific workshops by the Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri and the University of Florence. Visits are possible and are managed by the Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze. Architecture The villa is in the form of a \\"U\\", which encompasses the central courtyard, enclosed by a wall on the street side, facing the farmhouse. The courtyard has a loggia, supported by arch-less Tuscan columns. The façade on the street is very simple, with some rectangular windows with stone frames. Here you will find the bust of the astronomer, with inscription (1843), and another plaque placed in 1942.

It can be traced back to primitive societies when the adoration of a holy tree was prevalent. Whilst Money trees may be derived from the Sun tree myth associated with paradise, the coins link paradise with a material bounty in this world. According to the existing historical narratives, the concept of the \\"money tree\\" is derived at the latest from the Han Dynasty. Cast-bronze money trees are a conspicuous feature of Han tombs in Sichuan. Archaeology Money trees have been excavated by archaeologists from Han tombs in western China in and near Sichuan Province, an indication that the adoration of the money tree was prevalent in the Han Dynasty. Appearance A modern 'money tree' observed in Yunnan, China, 2015-12-01. They are made from bronze and green-glazed earthenware. Money trees are decorated with scenes of paradise containing magical creatures and immortals including the sun bird, the moon toad, the deer who finds the main ingredient for the elixir of immortality, and the clever monkey who steals the elixir. Myths and folk talesFolktales= One folk tale tells of a sculptor who placed fake money on a tree in order to trick villagers into cutting it down for him. But so many people believed the tree to be sacred that it became sacred and the sculptor is warned that if he cuts down or harms the tree he will be cursed. At the end of the story the sculptor is bribed not to harm the tree. Also, if you touch the leaf, you will have good fortune. =The underworld= It was thought that the coins emitted light, or that the coins guided the deceased, who would ride on a winged ram up the ceramic mountain to the bronze tree of paradise. These coins could also be plucked for needs on the journey from earth to the realm of immortals. Chinese New Year The Money tree regains popularity during the Chinese New Year. According to custom, money trees are made of a bushy pine or cypress branch nestled inside a porcelain pot filled with rice grains. Melon seeds and pine nuts are sprinkled over the top of the rice. Decorating the branches are gold and silver coin garlands made of paper. Symbols of long life (including paper cranes and deer) also embellish the tree, which is usually topped by the genie of wealth, Liu Hai, or the character for happiness. In Malaysia the Chinese put out Money Trees on the second day of the celebrations of the Chinese New Year.

The circle-shaped square is used for various events, such as a book market and an open-air cinema. Marie Heinekenplein was constructed in the early 1990s. It lies just outside the city centre, in the neighbourhood of De Pijp, along the street Ferdinand Bolstraat. The Quellijnstraat runs along the southern edge of the square. Tram lines 16 and 24 have a stop near the square. Along the Marie Heinekenplein are a number of bars and cafés. The square is lined with café terraces. Between the square and the Stadhouderskade street is the former Heineken brewery, now a popular tourist attraction known as the Heineken Experience. Along the northern side of the square is a modern apartment building incorporating a supermarket and other shops at ground level. One of the three restaurants of renowned Chinese restaurant chain Nam Kee is located along the square. Originally the area was part of the Heineken brewery complex. In 1988, most of the brewery was demolished, and in 1993, construction of the square was started. The name of the square was the source of much debate in Amsterdam. Originally it was supposed to be named after Nelson Mandela. The plan was scrapped after Winnie Mandela was convicted in 1991 of kidnapping and being an accessory to assault in connection with the death of 14-year-old James Seipei. Local street-naming rules do not allow a street to be named after someone who is still alive or a company. This also prevented the square to be named \\"Heinekenplein\\". The square is located in an area of De Pijp where streets are normally named after Dutch painters. An elegant compromise was struck by naming the square after a niece of the Heineken founder Gerard Adriaan Heineken, painter Marie Heineken (1844-1930).

He rose to become managing partner of Ransom, Bouverie & Co., a banking firm. He continued in this role once he was elected to Parliament. In 1868, he was elected as President of the National Bible Society of Scotland after the resignation of George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll.

This conference includes diplomats and heads of state from a number of countries. It took place in May 2009 in Manado, Indonesia. Its topic is the threat to various nations from rising oceans due to global warming. The conference was scheduled to be held from 11–14 May, included hundreds of officials and experts from over 74 countries. It is seen as a prelude to talks in December 2009 regarding a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol. Background The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), as the instrument that sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972, and its 1996 Protocol. Recognises that oceans and coasts provide valuable resources and services to support human populations, particularly coastal communities that heavily depend on them. Sustainable use of marine living resources will enhance global food security and reduce poverty for present and future generations. The declaration will be put forward to the UN FCCC and hopefully adopted at the COP 15 in Copenhagen at the end of the year. Climate change issues that could potentially result on inter alia. Degradation of marine environment, in particular the loss of marine diversity, threatened marine ecosystems by land- based and sea-based pollution, alien invasive species, unsustainable use of marine and coastal resources, physical alteration, poor land-use planning, and socio-economic pressures, equally concerned over marine ecosystems and living resources being affected by sea level rise, increased water temperature, ocean acidification, changing weather patterns, and other variations that may result from climate change, and how these alterations may aggravate the existing pressures of marine environmental degradation and increase risks to global food security, economic prosperity, and the well-being of human populations. Realizing the detrimental effects and importance of climate change, The WOC agreed to discuss the commitments on how to increase the role ocean in reducing the impact of climate change. The WOC have three main interests of states: * SIDS - very concern on sea-level rise (Indonesia is the largest archipelagical country in the world). Climate change is particularly threatening to Indonesia as sea level rise would adversely affect many Indonesia's low-lying coastal areas. * Tropical developing states - on adaptation measures, food security, and livelihood * Developed states - observing the possibility that the ocean could function as \\"Carbon Sink\\" Objectives The main purpose of the WOC 2009 is to adoption of Manado Ocean Declaration (MOD). The declaration consists of 14 core opening paragraphs and 21 points of operative agreement. The contents of the declaration include the commitment to long-term conservation, management, and sustainable use of marine living resources, establish national strategies to sustainably manage marine and coastal ecosystems and enhance their resilience, reduce land- and sea-based pollution, and also to increase understanding and information exchange on coasts, oceans and climate change, particularly in developing countries. Despite criticism the MOD was not strong enough to push the international community to help developing nations deal with the impacts of climate change, Indonesian Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Minister Freddy Numberi, chairman of the conference, said the WOC had put oceans center stage in world attention and raised awareness of the importance of oceans in climate change.

It was part of the Second Carnatic War. Background In the early part of 18th century, the Mughal Empire of India was in its last throes. The princely states of India, a few hundred in number, became more and more autonomous and independent with the reduced oversight of the vast Mughal empire. The British and French East India companies, which were present in Mughal India due to the hospitality of the Mughal emperors, were doing vibrant trade across the oceans between Mughal India and Europe. The British East India Company represented British trading interests with factories, ports at Calcutta, Madras and Bombay on the three coasts of India. The French East India Company operated out of Pondicherry, just down the coast from Madras. Both European powers entered into agreements with local Nawabs and princely states, primarily for trade contacts but also hoping to gain influence over the territories that provided trade goods and tax revenue. As England and France were rivals in Europe, they carried on their rivalry to the new Eastern trade frontier by way of extending their support to rival Nawabs in India. The Indian princes were ambivalent toward the Europeans and as much as they appreciated the income from trade, they primarily desired the military might the Europeans could supply to tip the local balance of power in their favour. In the Deccan proper, the Asaf Jah I (also known as Nizam-ul-Mulk) had founded a hereditary dynasty, with Hyderabad for its capital, which claimed to exercise authority over the entire South. The Carnatic – that is, the lowland tract between the central plateau and the Bay of Bengal – was ruled by the Nizam's deputy, the Nawab of Arcot. Farther to the south, a Hindu king reigned at Trichinopoly; and another Hindu kingdom had its seat at Tanjore. Inland, Mysore was rapidly developing into a third Hindu state; while everywhere lived chieftains, called palegars or naiks, in semi-independent lordship of citadels or hill-forts, representing the fief- holders of the ancient Hindu Vijayanagara Empire; and many of them having maintained a practical independence since its fall in 1565.Full text of \\"The makers of British India\\" Lord Clive When the Nizam of the Deccan, Asaf Jah I died in 1748, the British and French supported rival claimants to the throne and the French candidate ultimately won out. In another disputed succession of the Carnatic which was ruled by the Nizam's deputy, the Nawab of Arcot. The French supported Chanda Sahib in his intrigues and military campaigns to become Nawab of Arcot. The net result of the above two important events was the British factory and port situated at Madras was surrounded by hostile territory. Chanda Sahib, after consolidating his control of Arcot, wanted to eliminate his last major British-supported rival, Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah, who was at Trichinopoly. Chanda Sahib led a large force to besiege Trichinopoly. Ali was supported by a handful of his own men and about 600 British troops. As the British commander did not have a reputation for inspiring confidence, British authorities in other parts of India were on the verge of writing off Trichinopoly and the entire south to the French. Robert Clive, a one-time East India Company clerk who had served in the company's forces during the First Carnatic War, was outraged at the weak British response to French expansion. He proposed a plan to the governor at Madras, Thomas Saunders. Rather than challenge the strong Franco-Indian forces at Trichinopoly, he would strike at Arcot, Chanda Sahib's capital city, with the goal of forcing Chanda Sahib to lift the siege at Trichinopoly. Saunders agreed, but could only part with 200 of the 350 British soldiers under his command. Those 200 soldiers and a further 300 sepoys along with 3 small guns and eight European officers marched towards Arcot from Madras on 26 August 1751. On the morning of the 29 August they reached Conjeeveram, which was at a distance of from Madras. Clives's intelligence informed him that the enemy garrison at Arcot was twice the size of his marching forces. From Conjeeveram to Arcot is and the troops of Clive, in spite of a delay caused by a tremendous storm of thunder and lightning, reached Arcot in two days of forced marching. The garrison left by Chanda Sahib to defend Arcot, struck with panic at the sudden coming of the foe, at once abandoned the fort, despite their larger numbers. Clive and his forces took over the city and the fort without firing a single shot.With Clive in India, Or, the Beginnings of an Empire - G. A. Henty - Google Boeken When apprised of the loss of Arcot, Chanda Sahib immediately dispatched 4,000 of his best troops with 150 of the French, under the command of his son, Raza Sahib, to recapture it. On the 23 September Raza Sahib entered the town and invested the fort with an army of 2,000 native regular troops, 5,000 irregulars, 120 Europeans, and 300 cavalry. Preliminary stories Arcot, a city of 100,000 at the time, quickly came under Clive's control, since he ordered that there be no looting and he returned property Chanda Sahib had confiscated to its rightful owners. He immediately began gathering supplies and fresh water, and reinforcing the city's defenses. There were only sixty days' provisions, but an ample supply of water. The Arcot fort was about a mile in circuit, with a low, unsubstantial parapet; some of its towers were in dilapidated condition and virtually useless as artillery positions. The moat was in several places fordable, and in other places completely dry. Clive's force was also reduced by disease and casualties to a mere 120 Europeans and 200 sepoys. Chanda Sahib's garrison was encamped a few miles away, blocking the arrival of any resupply or reinforcements. Two sallies against them failed, so Clive decided on a night attack on 14 September. It was so successful the entire force scattered in fear, while Clive's men incurred no casualties. Two days later word came that Governor Saunders had sent two large cannon. Clive sent almost his entire force to escort the guns to the city, and the handful that remained drove off two night attacks, taking advantage of the darkness to disguise their low numbers. =Siege= Clive occupied the fort in the city centre, allowing Raza's troops to man taller buildings overlooking the walls. Clive attempted a sortie to drive the newcomers away, but ran into intense fire from newly occupied buildings. His attack managed to kill most of the French artillerymen, but he suffered the loss of fifteen of his British troops. Completely surrounded, the defenders soon began to suffer. Cut off from outside water, the fort's reservoir was brackish. Food, thankfully, was not a problem. The besieging force, manning the nearest houses, shot at anyone who moved. The small defending force exhausted itself trying to maintain a patrol of the fort's wall. The native troops showed no less zeal and energy in the defence than their European comrades; and, with a fine generosity of feeling, they proposed to give that all the grain in store should be reserved for the use of the latter, who required more nourishment than Asiatics; for themselves, the liquor in which the rice was steeped would be sufficient. =Negotiations= Back in Madras Governor Saunders scraped together a few more soldiers and received some new recruits from England. In the third week in October a force of but 130 British and 100 sepoys finally got on the way. Unfortunately for the defenders, the relief force was intercepted and forced to retreat. Late in October a battery of artillery arrived from the French base at Pondicherry and was positioned northwest of Clive's position. It soon knocked out one of Clive's large cannon and damaged another. For six days the French pounded the walls, destroying a section of wall between two dilapidated towers. The British tried to plug the gap with trenches, wooden palisades, and piled-up rubble. Another battery was set up to the southwest and created another breach. The siege dragged its slow length along. Provisions and ammunition were on the point of exhaustion, and when the fiftieth day was reached, Clive's only hope lay in the assistance promised by Morari Rao, a Maratha chief, who had hitherto remained neutral, but, impressed by the British will, promised to come to their aid. As the Maratha commander, Morari Rao, was collecting his pay, Raza Sahib learned of the threat. He quickly offered Clive honorable conditions and a gift if he would surrender. Knowing the Marathas were at hand and that another force was coming from Madras, Clive refused. Then Raza Sahib sent word that he would immediately storm the fort, and put every one of its defenders to the sword. Clive coldly replied that his father was a usurper, his army a rabble, and that he should think twice before he sent such cravens into a breach defended by English soldiers. Battle War elephants belonging to the Mughal Empire's Nawab of the Carnatic, Chanda Sahib, assisted by a small number of troops from the French East India Company batter the gates of Arcot. Raza Sahib resolved to venture an assault, and fixed it for 14 November, a day on which is celebrated the great Muhammadan festival of the Moharram, in memory of Hassan, the son of Ali. But on 13 November, a spy alerted Clive to the oncoming assault. The enemy advanced, driving before them elephants whose foreheads were armed with iron plates. It was expected that the gates would yield to the shock of those living battering-rams. But the huge beasts no sooner felt the English musket-balls, than they turned round and rushed furiously away, trampling on the multitude which had urged them forward. A raft was launched on the water which filled one part of the ditch. Clive, perceiving that the gunners at that post did not understand their business, took the management of a piece of artillery himself, and cleared the raft in a few minutes. Where the moat was dry the assailants mounted with great boldness, but the British fire was heavy and well directed that they made no progress. The rear ranks of the British kept the front ranks well supplied with a constant succession of loaded muskets, and every shot told upon the living mass below. After these desperate assaults the besiegers retired behind the ditch. The struggle lasted about an hour. Four hundred of the assailants fell, while the defenders lost only five or six men. The besieged passed an anxious night, looking for a renewal or the attack. But when day broke the enemy were no more to be seen. Under cover of fire, Raza Sahib had raised the siege and withdrawn his army to Vellore, leaving behind several guns and a large quantity of ammunition. Aftermath Clive's force had achieved an amazing feat in the face of the overwhelming numerical odds against them, but in India numbers were not always the telling factor. The death of the assault commander in the final charge broke his force's spirit. Whatever the combination of circumstances that brought about Clive's victory, the siege of Arcot marked a sea change in the British experience in India. Clive's biographer Mark Bence-Jones wrote, \\"It may have been luck, it may have been bungling on the part of the enemy, but it created the legend of English courage and invincibility which was to carry English arms in India from one success to another\\".Clive by Bence-Jones, page 48 Many in southern India, including some of the attacking soldiers, joined the British company's army. When the British began to seriously recruit and train the men from the armies and provinces they conquered, they ended up with a top-notch army of sepoys mixed with a handful of British Army units assigned to India. France lost her colonial empire ambitions, and the fall in her fortunes in India was made worse by French losses a few years later in the Seven Years' War.

Russell was charged with five counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault. Officials stated there was an argument at the Camp Liberty Combat Stress Center and Russell was being escorted back to his unit at Camp Stryker when he took an unsecured M16 rifle from his escort, drove back to the clinic, and opened fire on unarmed personnel. Background Sergeant John M. Russell (born 1965) was serving his third tour of duty in Iraq as a communications NCO with the 54th Engineer Battalion. According to a fellow NCO, Russell was a quiet soldier who seemed to have trouble with new computer systems and learning how to make repairs. Russell was \\"very good\\" with traditional radio devices, but a lack of new skills degraded his performance and relationship with peers. Over time, the NCO said Russell became increasingly distant and visibly disturbed. Russell has been previously diagnosed with depression and dyslexia. In the days before the killings, witnesses stated Russell became distant and began having suicidal thoughts. Russell had been to the Camp Liberty Combat Stress Clinic on three prior occasions. On May 11, 2009, Russell went to the clinic for a fourth time for a noon appointment.Inquiry into Iraq stress clinic shooting reveals institutional failures Killings Officials stated that at Russell's noon appointment at the clinic, there was a heated argument between Russell and clinic personnel.

Court martial proceedings Russell was charged with five counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault. On May 15, 2012, prosecutors decided to seek the death penalty, overruling a pre-trial hearing recommendation that Russell's mental \\"disease or defect\\" made capital punishment inappropriate. Lead defense attorney James Culp stated he would pursue an insanity defense, alleging treatment Russell received just prior to the killings was \\"mental health mistreatment\\" and \\"a significant causal factor\\" in the massacre. =Mental health claims= Under already contentious circumstances, the decision by military prosecutors to seek the death penalty against Sgt.

Military Mental Health Crisis Exposed With Camp Liberty Killings Lead defense attorney James Culp called treatment Russell received just prior to the killings \\"mental health mistreatment\\" and \\"a significant causal factor\\" in the massacre, leading him to pursue a \\"first-ever\\" insanity defense. News feature stories have subsequently appeared supporting, and rebutting, that argument. An indictment of combat zone mental health care in the U.S. military, an August 1, 2012 Bloomberg BusinessWeek story suggested the three counselors Russell saw for about 2.5 hours total are culpable, and could have prevented the tragedy. But in an interview , Weekly Scientist(cite not linked) one of those counselors, psychiatrist (then Lt. Col.) Michael Jones, counters in detail. Jones, who roomed with victim Matthew Houseal and survived the shootings by escaping through a window, instead describes a combat stress team that was \\"competent, well-trained, and empathetic\\" and a soldier, Sgt.

An allegedSenior Sri Lankan officials made repeated public statements denying that the GSL was shelling the NFZ or targeting hospitals and was not responsible for any civilian casualties. series of shellings and aerial attacks began on 23 April 2009 when the Mullivaikal Hospital was hit by three artillery shells. It continued on 28 and 29 April when the Mullivaikkal Primary Health Center was hit multiple times over a two-day period with six killed and many injured including one medical staffer. On the 29th and the 30th the Mullivaikal Hospital was again hit multiple times with nine more killed and fifteen injured. There were two attacks against the Mullivaikal Hospital on 2 May, one at 9 a.m. and a second at 10.30 a.m. resulting in sixty-eight killed and eighty-seven wounded, including medical staffers. On the morning of 12 May 2009 it was hit by an artillery mortar, killing at least forty-nine patients and injuring more than fifty others. All of these attacks were allegedly by the Sri Lankan Army; however, the Sri Lankan Government denied the allegation stating there is no evidence. At the time of the last bombing, Red Cross was scheduled to ship around 2,000 of the patients out of the Safe Zone over the next couple of days, according to Tamilnet. Background and investigations Human Rights Watch accuses the Sri Lankan military of shelling hospitals in the Safe Zone indiscriminately with artillery and attacking them aerially beginning with the Mullaitivu General Hospital in December 2008 and including at least eight other hospitals. Human Rights Watch argues that these attacks constitute war crimes. They've also said that the hospitals are clearly marked. United States government photographs taken at the time show the markings. In 2009, following the end of the Tamil uprising, the U.S. Department of State issued a \\"Report to Congress on Incidents during the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka\\". The president of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed a committee to study and respond to that report. The committee members were Chairman D.S. Wijesinghe PC,Counsel to the President Nihal Jayamannne PC, C. R. De Silva PC, Mano Ramanathan,Mrs. Manohari Ramanathan is the widow of Justice Ramanathan, a lawyer and formerly State Deputy Legal Draughtsman. Jezima IsmailMrs. Jezima Ismail is a leading educationist, formerly Vice Chancellor of the Eastern University and Principal of Muslim Ladies’ College. and Anura Meddegoda.Anura Meddegoda is a lawyer and a former prosecuting attorney at the Hague. He was appointed after the original five members. The secretary of the committee was S.M. Samarakoon. The committee interviewed numerous parties including high ranking officers of the armed forces and medical officers who had been attached to Puthukkudiyiruppu, Mullivaikkal and other hospitals during the latter stages of the conflict. Although the committee received several extensions, no report was issued. The April 2011 United Nations Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka found that the allegations that the Sri Lankan military shelled hospitals were credible. They specifically found that the Mullivaikkal Hospital was clearly marked as such and that it was shelled by the Sri Lankan Army. In May 2010 President Rajapaksa appointed a Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission to deal with the aftermath of the war. The commission received testimony about the shelling of the Mullivaikkal Hospital. In their final report they concluded in general that: However, the Commission did not specifically identify incidents in its conclusion and in fact concluded that non-availability of primary evidence of a technical nature and also the fact that supportive civilian evidence is equivocal in nature and does not warrant a definitive conclusion that one Party or the other was responsible for the shelling. There were no recommendations to the military as a result of the hospital shellings. In fact the Commission concluded: \\"On consideration of all facts and circumstances before it, the commission concludes that the security forces had not deliberately targeted the civilians in the NFZs, although civilian casualties had in fact occurred in the course of crossfire.\\" They went on to say: \\"the Commission after most careful consideration of all aspects, is of the view that the Security Forces were confronted with an unprecedented situation when no other choice was possible and all \\"feasible precautions\\" that were practicable in the circumstances had been taken. In April 2012, the U.S. State Department Office of Global Criminal Justice (GCJ),The GCJ was formerly the Office of War Crimes Issues (WCI) led by Ambassador-at-Large Stephen Rapp, submitted a report on Sri Lanka to the U.S Congress that diplomatically praised the LLRC report, but asked for the Government of Sri Lanka to establish an independent mechanism to investigate the credible allegations that the LLRC failed to address. The GCJ indicated that the allegations regarding the shelling of known hospitals implicate grave breaches of International humanitarian law and merit further investigation.

He served as head of the department of chemistry at the University of Oxford from 1997 to 2006. Richards is a pioneer in the field of computer-aided molecular design, in particular its application to the pharmaceuticals industry. He was the founding scientist of Oxford Molecular Ltd., and introduced a novel model for the funding of research at Oxford University, which has been copied elsewhere. Richards has published more than 300 scientific papers, including 15 books. Education Graham Richards was born 1 October 1939 in Hoylake, England, to Percy and Gwendoline Julia (Evans) Richards.Entry in Register of Births for Wirral 4th qtr of 1939 vol 8a page 1143 William G born to Richards and Evans Both parents were of Welsh extraction. Richards was educated at Birkenhead School. Richards won a scholarship to Brasenose College, Oxford, starting his studies there in 1958. Richards received his bachelor's degree in Chemistry with first class honors from the University of Oxford in 1961. Richards then studied the electronic spectroscopy of diatomic molecules with Richard F. Barrow, earning his Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees from the University of Oxford in 1964. Career and research After his PhD, he continued his spectroscopic work with fellowships in Oxford (ICI Research Fellowship, Junior Research Fellowship at Balliol College) and Paris, France (Centre de Mécanique Ondulatoire Appliquée). Graham Richards soon returned to Oxford as a research fellow at Balliol College, Oxford (1964-1966). He was promoted to a lecturer at Oxford University (1966-1994), to reader (1994-1996), and to professor (1996-2007). He served as chairman of the chemistry department from 1997-2006. Richards celebrated his formal retirement from the University of Oxford on 18 May 2007. He is now an Emeritus fellow of Brasenose College. =Industry involvement= In the fourth year of his degree course Richard's research project led him to using Oxford's Ferranti Mercury computer to solve integrals. During a fellowship year in France at Centre de Mécanique Ondulatoire Appliquée, he was able to use more powerful computers. Returning to Oxford, he worked on ab initio computations and applied computational techniques to solving quantum mechanical problems in theoretical chemistry, in particular studying spin-orbit coupling. His influential paper Third age of quantum chemistry (1979) marked the development of computational techniques for theoretical analysis whose precision equaled or surpassed experimental results. Richards saw the potential to apply computer techniques for examining the structure and properties of compounds in the area of pharmaceutical applications. He became a pioneer in the field of computer- aided molecular design. He was the first to produce coloured images modelling molecular structure graphically, and introduced many of the techniques now widely used in academia and industry. In 1982, Richards became a founding member of the Molecular Graphics Society (now the Molecular Graphics and Modelling Society, MGMS). The society started the Journal of Molecular Graphics in 1983. Richards served as the editor-in-chief of the journal from 1984 to 1996. The journal's name changed to Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling in 1997. In 1989 Richards was the scientific co-founder (with Tony Marchington, David Ricketts, James Hiddleston, and Anthony Rees) of Oxford Molecular Limited. The company developed software for modelling of small molecules and proteins, and drug design. The company was possible in part because of economic and legal changes under the government of Margaret Thatcher that enabled British universities to become involved with venture capital and technology transfer. As Oxford Molecular Group, Ltd. (OMG) the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1992, making the university £10 million. The company was worth £450 million at its peak but was eventually sold for £70 million. It was one of several companies that combined to form Accelrys in 2001. Richards was instrumental in raising £64 million to fund a new laboratory for Oxford University through an innovative funding approach. £20 million worth of funding began with an \\"unusual collaboration\\" between Graham and David Norwood. Norwood then arranged for Beeson-Gregory to provide £20 million in exchange for half the University's equity share of any spin-out companies emanating from the Chemistry Department for 15 years. In 2003, Beeson-Gregory and Evolution Group merged, later creating a subsidiary, IP2IPO (\\"Intellectual property to initial public offering\\". Graham Richards became a Non-executive Director of IP2IPO in 2001, and Non-executive Chairman of IP2IPO in 2004. Through this arrangement the Chemistry Department has contributed over £100 million to the University of Oxford. Richards served as a director of ISIS Innovation Ltd., the University of Oxford's technology transfer company. It became Oxford University Innovation as of June 2016. It has brought around 60 spin-out companies into existence. The Financial Times has described the approach as \\"the way universities should be financed in the future\\". Richards also introduced the use of distributed computing in pharmaceutical design. Started in 2000, his Screensaver Lifesaver project exploited idle time on more than 3.5 million personal computers in over 200 countries, whose owners agreed to be involved and downloaded the project's screensaver. Using idle time from these computers, the project's software created a virtual supercomputer that screened billions of compounds against protein targets, searching for possible drug treatments for cancer, anthrax and smallpox. The project involved collaboration between Intel, United Devices, and the Centre for Computational Drug Discovery at the University of Oxford, headed by Richards and funded by the National Foundation for Cancer Research (NFCR). Graham formed the spin-out company InhibOx Ltd. in 2001. InhibOx applied cloud computing techniques to computational chemistry and drug discovery, and developed a searchable database of small-molecules called Scopius. In 2002, Richards donated his shares, twenty-five percent of the company, to the National Foundation for Cancer Research. In 2017, InhibOx relaunched as Oxford Drug Design Ltd., with a new focus on antibiotic discovery. Richards joined the Science Advisory Panel of Oxford Medical Diagnostics. Richards is a non-executive director of IP Group plc, having also served as its chairman. =Selected books=   =Awards and honours= Richards is a council member of the Royal Society of Chemistry and of The Royal Institution, a Fellow of the Royal Society, and was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). The Times Higher Education Supplement (2006) considered Richards to be one of twelve academic \\"super- earners\\" in the United Kingdom. Times magazine's first Eureka issue (2010) included Richards in its list of the top 100 British scientists. Richards' work has been acknowledged through a number of more formal awards and honours, including the following: * 2018, elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) * 2018, Richard J.

Marcial Maciel LC (late 2004) Marcial Maciel was the founding leader of the Legion of Christ, based in Mexico, and its general director from 1941 to January 2005. The sexual scandal was related to accusations since the 1970s that the prominent Mexican Roman Catholic priest had sexually abused many minors and fathered a total of six children by three different women. Described as a charismatic leader and the \\"greatest fundraiser of the modern Roman Catholic church,\\" he was successful in recruiting seminarians at a time of declining priestly vocations. Maciel was the \\"highest ranking priest ever disciplined because of sexual abuse allegations.\\" Formal charges against Maciel were filed by nine men with the Vatican in 1998. The scandal related to Maciel was linked with the wider series of international Catholic sex abuse cases being reported in the Catholic church. Church authorities were criticized for a slow pace of investigations, with conjecture that it was because Maciel was close to Pope John Paul II and had well-placed connections among senior clergy. Putting forward his age, John Paul II's Vatican chose not to prosecute Maciel, but in 2006 Pope Benedict XVI forced him to retire from active ministry. Maciel died in 2008. In March 2010, the Legion of Christ in a communique\\"Communique\\", Legion of Christ acknowledged that Maciel had committed \\"reprehensible actions,\\" including sexual abuse. The communique stated that \\"given the gravity of his faults, we cannot take his person as a model of Christian or priestly life.\\" The Legion had long denied the allegations against the priest and, since Maciel's forced retirement in 2006 had not made any official statement one way or the other.Berry, Jason. \\"Money paved way for Maciel's influence in the Vatican\\", National Catholic Reporter, April 6, 2010 On May 1, 2010, the Vatican denounced Maciel's actions and said that the Legion needed reform; a Papal Delegate was designated to oversee the organization and its governance. History of investigations1956 investigation= Father Marcial Maciel, a Mexican priest who was the general director of the Legion of Christ, which he founded in 1941, was investigated several times for his behavior. In 1956, the Vatican had him removed as superior and investigated allegations of drug (morphine) abuse. After interviewing members of the then-small congregation, the Vatican cleared him. Maciel was reinstated in February 1959. Legion of Christ There are no records of any members reporting sexual abuse at that time. However, since then two seminarians reported that they had lied to investigators in 1956; they did not report having been abused because Father Maciel had them earlier take a vow never to speak ill of him.Berry, Jason. \\"Fr. Marcial Maciel leaves behind a flawed legacy\\", National Catholic Reporter. 22 Feb 2008 =Accusations since the 1970s= Since the 1970s, Maciel has been twice accused of having repeatedly sexually abused other congregation members, including young children. His accusers include a priest, a guidance counselor, a professor, an engineer, a lawyer, and a former priest who became a university professor. These two Spaniards and seven Mexicans described themselves as former members of a favored group, known as the \\"apostolic schoolboys.\\" They said that the abuse allegedly occurred over three decades, beginning in the 1940s in Spain and Italy. As promising boys and young men, the Mexicans had been taken there to be educated.El Legionario, by Alejandro Espinoza, Mexico City: Grijalbo, 2003, p. 22. They said the abuse involved some 30 boys and young men, and extended over at least three decades. =Nine different accusers= In 1998, the nine men above filed formal charges against Fr. Maciel at the Vatican. (One man subsequently retracted his story, claiming it had been a fabrication intended to damage the Legion; the other eight continue to maintain these allegations.) The accusers described how Maciel would feign having an illness in his groin and falsely claim to have been given papal permission to receive help massaging away the pain. Fr. Maciel and the Legion originally denied the accusations. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), led by then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (who later became Pope Benedict XVI), examined the allegations. The CDF told the plaintiffs the following year that Maciel would not be prosecuted because of his age. =Reopening the case= In 2004, the plaintiffs were informed by letter that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith had decided to reopen the investigation against Maciel. Shortly after, Maciel stepped down as General Director of the Legion at the Ordinary General Chapter held in January 2005., New York Times (23 April 2005) Fr Alvaro Corcuera was elected by the same General Chapter as the new General Director. The CDF did not prosecute Fr. Maciel because of his age. =Retirement= On 19 May 2006, the Vatican published a communique for the press, instructing Maciel to retire from active ministry to a life of \\"prayer and penitence\\",Vatican Communiqué, , Zenit News Agency (19 May 2006) The Legion's vows of obedience which required members to maintain secrecy, impermeability, and refrain from giving any in the Legion possible humility was also lifted by Pope Benedict XVI in December 2007.https://www.jornada.com.mx/2007/12/12/index.php?section=opinion&article;=024a1pol Despite all this, Maciel was never defrocked.https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/27/world/europe/27legion.html He moved to a house for priests in Jacksonville, Florida, United States, where he died in 2008. Maciel and the Legion continued to deny all accusations until his death in 2008. On 3 September 2009, Fr. Julio Marti and Fr. Scott Reilly (the territorial directors of the Legion in the US and Canada) made a formal apology on behalf of the Legion. They said, > \\"We are deeply saddened and sorry, and we sincerely ask for forgiveness from > God and from those who have been hurt through this. We also regret that our > inability to detect, and thus accept and remedy, Father Maciel’s failings > has caused even more suffering.\\"\\"Letter from the North American Territorial > Directors\\", Regnum Christi, September 3, 2009 In 2014 the General Chapter of the Legionaries of Christ made a more formal and extensive apology. =Further revelations= On 3 February 2009 The New York Times reported: > \\"The Legionaries of Christ, an influential Roman Catholic religious order, > have been shaken by new revelations that their founder, who died a year ago, > had an affair with a woman and fathered a daughter just as he and his > thriving conservative order were winning the acclaim of Pope John Paul II.\\" This has been confirmed by the Legion of Christ. The BBC reported that Maciel had a total of six natural (illegitimate) children by three different women, two of whom lived in Mexico and one in Switzerland.El Mundo, Spanish language website, 4 February 2009, accessed 27 March 2009. The Rev. Thomas V. Berg LC, Executive Director of the Westchester Institute for Ethics and the Human Person, formally apologized to the victims of Fr. Maciel, \\"In shock, sorrow, and with a humbled spirit, I want to express my deepest sorrow for anyone who, in any way, has been hurt by the moral failings of Fr. Maciel.\\" North Carolina Register A few weeks after the scandal broke, Fr. Berg left the Legion of Christ to become a diocesan priest, transferring the Westchester Institute to the Archdiocese of New York.\\"Fr. Berg leaves Legion of Christ to join Archdiocese of New York\\", Catholic News Agency, May 7, 2009 =Civil suit on behalf of six Maciel children= In July 2009, attorney José Bonilla was appointed to represent three of a possible total of six of Maciel's natural children in a civil suit to recover Maciel's estate. The lawyer claimed that Maciel owned several properties in Mexico and around the world in his own name., Jornada Media in Spain had reported an interview with a woman who had a child with Maciel more than 20 years ago; she lived in a luxury apartment in Madrid which Maciel had purchased for her. Norma Hilda Baños said that she was abused as a minor by Maciel and later became pregnant by him. She bore and raised his daughter.RD, \\"La hija del pecador Legionario de Cristo\\", 9 de agosto 2009, Periodista Digital =Reaction of Archbishop O'Brien= In the wake of these revelations, Archbishop Edwin O'Brien of Baltimore told his archdiocesan newspaper that the order must offer \\"full disclosure of [Maciel's] activities and those who are complicit in them, or knew of them, and of those who are still refusing to offer disclosure.\\" He said that the order's finances should also be subject to \\"objective scrutiny\\". He described Maciel \\"a man with an entrepreneurial genius who, by systematic deception and duplicity, used our faith to manipulate others for his own selfish ends.\\" He criticized the \\"good deal of secrecy in [Maciel's] own life...[and] in the structures he created.\\" The archbishop welcomed the Vatican's decision in the following March to conduct an apostolic visitation of the Legionaries, and said that the order's abolition \\"should be on the table\\"., Catholic Review John L. Allen Jr., \\"Abolition of Legionaries should be 'on the table' \\", National Catholic Reporter, 3 April 2009, accessed 28 November 2015 Apostolic visitation In early 2009, the Vatican ordered an apostolic visitation of the institutions of the Legionaries of Christ following disclosures of sexual impropriety by the order's founder.Thavis, John. \\"Vatican orders apostolic visitation of Legionaries of Christ\\", Catholic News Service, March 31, 2009 Vatican authorities named five bishops from five different countries, each one in charge of investigating the Legionaries in a particular part of the world: *Ricardo Watti Urquidi, Bishop of Tepic, Mexico, in charge of Mexico and Central America, where the Legion has 44 houses, 250 priests and 115-120 religious seminarians;\\"Ricardo Watti Urquidi\\", Catholic Hierarchy *Charles J.

In December 2019, the organization accepted responsibility for 175 cases of child sexual abuse by 33 priests, including 60 minors who were abused by Marcial Maciel. The organization also stated that former Secretariat of State Angelo Sodano lead efforts to cover up the abuse committed by Maciel and other clergy.https://apnews.com/e23d4e965a0b84cad18bef11d9b5d825https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social- affairs/religion-and-beliefs/cardinal-92-who-sought-deal-to-bury-sex-abuse- documents-resigns-1.4122879 Formal denunciation by the Vatican On 1 May 2010, the Vatican named a delegate and appointed a commission to review the Legionaries of Christ. In a statement, the Vatican denounced Marcial Maciel for creating a \\"system of power\\" that enabled him to lead an \\"immoral\\" double life \\"devoid of scruples and authentic religious sentiment\\" and allowed him to abuse young boys for decades unchecked. The \\"very serious and objectively immoral acts\\" of Marcial Maciel, which were \\"confirmed by incontrovertible testimonies,\\" represent \\"true crimes and manifest a life without scruples or authentic religious sentiment,\\" the Vatican said.\\"Fr. Maciel guilty, 'profound' revision of Legion needed, report Apostolic Visitors\\", Catholic News Agency, May 1, 2010 The Vatican said the Legion created a \\"mechanism of defense\\" around Maciel to shield him from accusations and suppress damaging witnesses from reporting abuse. \\"It made him untouchable,\\" the Vatican said. The statement decried \\"the lamentable disgracing and expulsion of those who doubted\\" Maciel's virtue. The Vatican statement did not address whether the Legion's current leadership will face any sanctions. Actions taken by the current Legion leadership will be scrutinized; but no specific sanctions were mentioned. The Vatican acknowledged the \\"hardships\\" faced by Maciel's accusers through the years when they were ostracized or ridiculed, and commended their \\"courage and perseverance to demand the truth.\\" As a result of the visitation, Benedict XVI named Archbishop (later Cardinal) Velasio De Paolis on 9 July 2010 as the Papal Delegate to oversee the Legion and its governance.Pope Benedict XVI Names Delegate for the Legion of Christ , Regnum Christi website See also *Child sexual abuse *Religious abuse *Spiritual abuse References Category:Legion of Christ Category:Clerical celibacy Maciel ","title":"Sexual abuse scandal of Marcial Maciel"},{"id":"22775195","text":"Cortomobile is a four-wheeled cinema, designed inside a green Alfa Romeo 2000, year 1974.

It originally aired on May 11, 2009. The episode also marks the end of Alyson Hannigan's maternity leave; Lily returns to the show during the tag scene. Plot Picking up from the previous episode, Ted turns to see Stella and her fiancé Tony standing behind him at a crosswalk. Ted says that it is a great surprise to see them, and later at MacLaren's, Barney and Marshall praise his cool. Later that evening, Tony shows up at Ted's apartment, professing pity for Ted's condition, and wants to make it up to Ted. First he offers him a professor position at Columbia, which Ted turns down. Then, Tony brings Ted to a rich friend's house for dinner to offer Ted a job designing a new home. When the host starts insisting that his \\"laundry\\" room be soundproof, lined with stain-proof ceramic tiles, and filled with hanging chains, Ted quickly realizes the man is proposing the design of a \\"murder house\\". Eventually, Ted rejects Tony's help, claiming he is glad to be rid of Stella, who left him at the altar. The comment makes Tony reconsider his commitment to Stella, and he breaks off the engagement. Stella shows up at Ted's apartment distraught, begging him to help her salvage their relationship. Ted refuses, claiming Stella hurt him and his ability to appreciate love. Meanwhile, Barney complains about a speeding ticket he receives. Marshall brags about how he evaded a ticket back in Minnesota by enticing the officer with the offer of bratwurst at a BBQ. Barney takes this as a challenge, and vows to talk his way out of a ticket. After a few failures, Robin tells the story of how she cried her way out of a ticket. Finally, he encounters an attractive police officer. In the retelling of the story, Barney claims he promptly seduced the policewoman, but he was actually arrested for numerous moving violations. Barney calls Ted from jail in Brazzaville, NJ, desperate to be bailed out. Stella offers to drive Ted to New Jersey, and the two bail Barney out and drive him back to the city. Before he exits the car, Ted admits that he is tired of searching for love, and hopes to find what she and Tony have. Stella assures Ted that the woman meant for him is coming \\"as fast as she can\\". Ted agrees to talk to Tony and the couple get back together. Future Ted then talks about how Stella established a new, successful dermatological practice on the West Coast, and Tony became a successful screenwriter, with a hit in May 2010 called The Wedding Bride. Finally, at the bar, Lily returns, admitting the offensive joke Barney told her four weeks ago was actually funny, but once he starts explaining a scheme involving seducing amnesia patients, she promptly leaves again.

Life and work  Having graduated from the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute in 1916, Oleksandr Garmash worked on major construction projects of the USSR. He designs and supervises over construction of 15 multiple-arch and concrete bridges in the Ukrainian SSR, including regions of the Dnipropetrovsk oblast, works in special board on locking the Dnieper river. Under his projects and supervision there were built the arch and concrete bridge in the Hloba park, buildings of the sewing and shoe factories in Dnipropetrovsk. He contributed to the creation of the industrial base of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station and organization of industrial construction of the Dneprostal enterprise. He worked as a teacher in the Katerynoslavska Building Technical Evening School, since 1930 - in Dnipropetrovsk Building Institute on positions of the deputy director on educational and research work, chief of the chairs of organization of construction works, and construction operations. From 1932 – he is a member of editorial board of the editorial-publishing house «State Building Technical Publishing». He works as research supervisor of the scientific and research sector of the Institute. In 1937-1938 he acted as director of the Institute, later – worked as deputy director of the Institute. Prof. O.A. Harmash worked in the field of production line methods in construction. His research was focused, among other things, on liquidation of seasonality in construction activities: in 1931 he publishes his book «Construction activities in winter», in 1933 he begins his experimental work on electric heating of concrete. Materials and results of these research projects were presented in his book «Electric heating of concrete». Another important contribution to the line production methods in construction was his work «Organization and mechanization of transport in civil construction work» (1934).

Bethesda, a 501(c)3 non-profit, provides supports and services for more than 2,000 people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families in 13 states including California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Oregon, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. The organization is headquartered in Watertown, Wisconsin.  History  Bethesda was founded on April 13, 1904, in Watertown, Wisconsin, by Children’s Friends Societies from seven Midwestern states. The organization was originally named \\"The Society for the Training and Care of the Feeble-minded and Epileptic\\". The five people originally supported by the organization moved into rented quarters in Watertown. In 1906, the organization had grown to serve 14 people, but lost its lease. It relocated to a small vacant sanitarium in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for 2½ years and grew to serve a clientele of 40 people. Having outgrown its Milwaukee location, the organization returned to Watertown in 1909, where the first permanent building was located on farmland along the banks of the Rock River. Above the main entrance to that building was placed a stone inscribed with a single word, “Bethesda”. The word is Hebrew for “House of Mercy” and is taken from a story of healing in the fifth chapter of the Gospel of John. The name of the organization was not officially changed to Bethesda Lutheran Home until 1924. The original building quickly filled and others were built to accommodate a growing need for space. Through the first 40 years of its existence, Bethesda made use of the surrounding farmland and orchards to provide much of its own food. Many of the residents provided the necessary labor. =1970s= By the early 1970s, the number of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities living at the institution had grown to 660. In response to this large number of people, along with the growing level of individual needs, the board of directors and administration began to seek more appropriate living settings for many people. For others, they began to explore the possibility of establishing group homes away from Watertown and closer to people’s families. In 1977, the first Bethesda group home was established in Maryville, Missouri. The establishment of additional homes in other states followed. =1980–2010= The 1980s and 1990s were marked by significant expansion of services in a number of states. In two locations, Kansas and Texas, Bethesda acquired existing programs that were facing financial difficulties. Both programs are functioning and still expanding today. In Illinois, a number of new homes were constructed. In the early 1980s, Bethesda established the National Christian Resource Center (NCRC). The NCRC provides outreach services beyond the individuals it supports. For 25 years, the NCRC produced religious education materials for churches; staff training materials for other service providers; referral information to parents, teachers and pastors; and scholarship and award programs for grade school, high school and college students. In 2009, the NCRC gave way to the Bethesda Institute, which has become the primary outreach division of Bethesda Lutheran Communities. The Institute is planned to provide consultation, research, professional training, and leadership development in the field of intellectual and developmental disabilities. In recognition of its broadened role in producing outreach materials and services beyond its single location in Watertown, Bethesda's Board of Directors made the decision in 1992 to change the name of the organization to Bethesda Lutheran Homes and Services, Inc. In 2004, Bethesda opened a new corporate headquarters building. Good Shepherd Communities In 2006, Bethesda became a nationwide organization when Good Shepherd Communities (GSC) became a wholly controlled subsidiary of the organization. The histories of the two agencies had been intertwined since GSC’s inception. In 1949, Norma and Paul Yorde traveled from California to Watertown, Wisconsin, to inquire about placing their son on a waiting list for admission to Bethesda. Bethesda was unable to admit their son but offered the Yordes assistance in developing a program for people with disabilities on the west coast. Founded as Good Shepherd Lutheran Home of the West in Terra Bella, California, Bethesda provided assistance to help the organization get started and, in the 1970s, the two agencies even partnered on a successful joint fundraising initiative. In November 2008, Bethesda’s Board of Directors made the recommendation to affect the formal merger with Good Shepherd Communities, effective September 1, 2009. That recommendation was preceded by a year-long study of Bethesda’s mission, vision, and values with relation to the strength of its identity. A formal merger of Bethesda and GSC was approved in May 2009. As of September 1, 2009, the single organization became known as Bethesda Lutheran Communities.  Advocacy  Through its Bethesda Voices program, an online community, Bethesda seeks to improve public policy affecting people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Its purpose is to educate, engage and mobilize support for system reforms and improvements, and to seek improved and sustainable funding for services and supports. One focus is Medicaid reform, specifically, helping to make funding more accessible to people seeking services in the community as opposed to larger, institutional settings.  Programs  , Bethesda supports individuals in over 300 locations across 13 states including California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Oregon, Texas, Wisconsin, and Washington. Most people served by Bethesda receive residential supports in group homes and apartments. Bethesda also provides vocational training either on its own or by contracting with other local providers. =Employment supports= Bethesda assists people with intellectual and developmental disabilities find career opportunities in Wisconsin, Oregon, and Colorado. Employment staff evaluate individuals and help them navigate the hiring process. Bethesda also works with employers who are looking for staff. = Bethesda College = The Bethesda College of Applied Learning is a two-year post-secondary certificate program where students with intellectual and developmental disabilities can participate in college education. Students enrolled in Bethesda College live in integrated residence halls on the Concordia University Wisconsin campus in Mequon. = Outreach services = Through its primary outreach portal, the Bethesda Institute, the organization produces and distributes curricula and other resources supporting the spiritual lives of people with disabilities. Since 1986, the Institute has also produced staff training materials for distribution to other professional support providing agencies. =International work= On August 10, 2001, Bethesda joined with v. Bodelschwinghsche Anstalten Bethel of Germany, Nord-Norges Daikonistiftelse of Norway, Mosaic of the United States, and Bethphage of Great Britain to create IMPACT, an international organization formed to positively impact public policy throughout the world and to respond to the needs of children and adults with disabilities. International partnerships also exist with the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod World Relief and Human Care to provide special programs in Latvia, Romania, Russia, Kenya, and the Dominican Republic. = Camp Matz = Bethesda previously operated Camp Matz, a fully accessible camp for people with disabilities, staffed by volunteers from the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod’s Servant Event program. The camp was home to the only fully wheelchair accessible treehouse in the Midwest.

The railway is operated by the Malaysian railway operator Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM). Constructed from 1992 to 1997, Woodlands Train Checkpoint was opened on 1 August 1998 as the Singapore border control facility for rail passengers. At that time there were no boarding facilities, as northbound passengers heading towards Malaysia were required to clear Malaysian Customs and Immigration at Tanjong Pagar railway station in central Singapore, and northbound trains stopped at Woodlands Train Checkpoint for Singapore exit immigration checks only. However, southbound passengers could disembark after clearing Singapore Customs and Immigration at Woodlands Train Checkpoint, as they had already cleared Malaysian Immigration at Johor Bahru railway station. Since 1 July 2011, Woodlands Train Checkpoint has been the southern terminus of the KTM Intercity service. This followed an agreement between Malaysia and Singapore to close Tanjong Pagar railway station. Northbound passengers clear Singapore Immigration and Malaysian Customs and Immigration at Woodlands Train Checkpoint before boarding the train for Malaysia, while southbound passengers clear Malaysian Immigration at Johor Bahru Sentral railway station, and Singapore Customs and Immigration at Woodlands Train Checkpoint. The planned Johor Bahru–Singapore Rapid Transit System will replace shuttle train services to Woodlands Train Checkpoint by 2026. Train services A shuttle train service, known as the Shuttle Tebrau, links Woodlands Train Checkpoint with Johor Bahru Sentral. There are 31 trips daily: 17 trips from Johor Bahru and 14 trips from Woodlands. KTM Intercity train services that previously linked Woodlands Train Checkpoint with various destinations in Malaysia were truncated to terminate at Johor Bahru Sentral following the introduction of the shuttle train service on 1 July 2015. The Eastern and Oriental Express luxury train has its terminus at Woodlands Train Checkpoint. Transport connections Woodlands Train Checkpoint is served by public buses to Kranji MRT station, Marsiling MRT station, and Woodlands Temporary Bus Interchange at Woodlands MRT station. A footbridge links the train checkpoint with Woodlands Checkpoint for road vehicles. Border control issues Until 1998, both Malaysia and Singapore had their customs and immigration facilities for rail passengers at Tanjong Pagar railway station. Singapore decided to relocate its customs and immigration facilities to Woodlands despite Malaysia's unwillingness to vacate the Tanjong Pagar railway station according to the Malaysia–Singapore Points of Agreement of 1990. The ICA ceased operations at Tanjong Pagar and moved into Woodlands Train Checkpoint on 1 August 1998. While providing immigration facilities for southbound passengers at Johor Bahru, Malaysian Customs and Immigration for northbound passengers remained at Tanjong Pagar, refusing to relocate to either Woodlands or Johor Bahru. This peculiarity resulted in passengers travelling to Malaysia being granted entry to Malaysia before being granted exit from Singapore, which is contrary to international practice. To circumvent the problem, Malaysian Immigration officers in Tanjong Pagar did not stamp passports, instead scanning them into a computer system and providing a stamped embarkation/disembarkation card, to be retained until leaving Malaysia. This still posed problems for some visitors when leaving Malaysia due to the lack of a physical endorsement in their passports, especially for those who lost the card while in Malaysia.

The award is the highest tribute presented by the Foundation Fighting Blindness, a nonprofit organization that funds research and clinical trials on eye disease. It is named after Llura Liggett Gund, a national trustee of the Foundation and wife of Gordon Gund, the Foundation’s cofounder and chairman. Awardees receive a custom-designed Steuben crystal sculpture. According to its citation, the award recognizes “an individual whose outstanding dedication and commitment to retinal science for 15 years or more has resulted in highly significant advancements or breakthroughs in retinal degenerative disease research.”  Recipients  The award is presented as warranted. *2016 - Richard Weleber, Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health & Science University - for career achievement in the field of retinal-disease therapies. *2015 - José-Alain Sahel, Institut de la Vision in Paris - for his work on vision-saving treatments and cures. *2013 - William W. Hauswirth, Ph.D., the Maida and Morris Rybaczki Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Florida College of Medicine. He received the award for using non-harmful adeno- associated viruses (AAVs) to transport healthy DNA into retinal cells at the back of the eye, showing that gene therapy could restore vision in animal models, including Briard dogs. His team’s approach was then used in human clinical trials where children and young adults virtually blind from Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) have had significant vision restored. *2012 - Edwin Stone, M.D., Ph.D., the Seamans-Hauser Chair of Molecular Ophthalmology at the University of Iowa. Dr. Stone’s lab has been a leader in discovering and characterizing genes that cause retinal degenerations such as retinitis pigmentosa, Leber congenital amaurosis, and Stargardt disease, among other conditions. He and his colleagues are taking the new genetic information, creating models of disease, and then working to develop potential treatments for evaluation in clinical trials. This effort includes successfully converting a patient’s skin cells to stem cells, and then to retinal precursor cells to evaluate possible therapies. *2011 - Robert E. Anderson, M.D., Ph.D., professor of ophthalmology and cell biology at the Dean A. McGee Eye Institute and Professor of Ophthalmology and the George Lynn Cross Research Professor at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. He and his colleagues discovered years ago that omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oils are important for the most efficient and fastest development of the visual system, leading to their inclusion in infant formulas today. *2009 - Dean Bok, Ph.D., received the award for his work defining the link between vitamin A and vision. His research led the way in establishing the gene defect in the vitamin A metabolic cycle that ultimately directed researchers toward successful gene therapy clinical trials for Leber congenital amaurosis, a severe, early onset form of retinitis pigmentosa. *2007 - Matthew LaVail, Ph.D., received the award for his leadership role in understanding, identifying, and developing neuroprotective agents that slow or reverse vision loss. LaVail’s research has provided targets for the identification of dozens of potential treatments. *2001 - John Dowling, Ph.D., received the award for his groundbreaking work in understanding the functional organization of the retina, including synaptic organization, electrical responses of retinal neurons, and the exchange of retinoids in the visual cycle. Dowling's discoveries have been essential to the work of virtually every retinal researcher over the last several decades. *2000 - Eliot Berson, M.D., received the award for his discovery that vitamin A palmitate slows the rate of vision loss in people with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). As the only treatment for RP, vitamin A can potentially provide many additional years of useful vision. *1998 - Alan Laties, M.D., received the award in recognition of his career as a world-renowned neuro-ophthalmologist, neuro-ophthalmologic investigator, and educator in retinal science.

Life Fuerbringer was born in St. Louis, to Ludwig and Anna Zucker Fuerbringer. His father was a Lutheran minister. He was the youngest of five children. As a student at Harvard, he edited the student newspaper The Harvard Crimson. After graduating in 1932, he started working for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, before being hired by Time in 1942. Reaching the rank of assistant managing editor in 1951, he was appointed managing editor in 1960. Later, as head of Time Inc.'s magazine-development group, he also introduced People and Money magazines. He did much to rejuvenate what was a rather austere publication, and once famously said of the journalism his staff did that \\"It only has to be true this week.\\" Though a social conservative, Fuerbringer nevertheless did much to focus the magazine's attention on the counter-culture and the political and intellectual radicalism of the 1960s. A 1964 issue dealt with the sexual revolution, while in 1967 the birth control pill. During Fuerbringer's tenure as editor, the magazine's circulation rose from three to five million.l was discussed. His best known act as editor was probably his April 8, 1966 cover story \\"Is God Dead?\\" In the accompanying article he explored the role of religion in an increasingly secular society, and investigated a trend among contemporary theologians to write God out of the field of theology. Fuerbringer had initially been a supporter of the Vietnam War, but in 1968 he wrote an editorial conceding that the war was unwinnable. Shortly before his death, in 2007, he wrote an autobiography, titled \\"On TIME\\". Fuerbringer was married to his wife Winona Gunn Fuerbringer for 68 years. The couple had four children. The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Halberstam once said of Fuerbringer \\"He was the most controversial man within Time magazine, immensely influential, perhaps the most influential conservative of his generation in journalism, but outside the magazine almost no one knew his name.\\" Time employees sometimes called him \\"Otto Fingerbanger\\" or \\"The Iron Chancellor\\" for his imperious demeanor. Fuerbringer died in Fullerton, California in a retirement home.

Built about 1678 and altered several times during the 18th century, it is one of the state's oldest surviving buildings, and provides a virtual catalog of early construction methods due to its state of preservation. The house was acquired by Connecticut Landmarks in 1937, which operates it and the adjacent 1759 Nathaniel Hempstead House as a historic house museum complex known as the Hempsted Houses. The houses have been restored to reflect a late 17th to mid 18th-century appearance, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Description and history The Hempsted House is located west of downtown New London, on the east side of Hempstead Street between Hope and Truman Streets. It is a -story wood-frame structure, with a side-gable roof that has two front-facing gables. The left gable, in an unusual departure for houses of its age, projects forward of the main block, providing an enclosed vestibule on the first floor. Window openings are generally narrow, and filled with diamond-pane casement windows. The interior has exposed framing members that show the building's great age. The oldest portion of the house was three bays wide, and was a typical one-room structure with a chimney on one end. Although there is some disagreement by architectural historians, it was probably built c. 1678 by Joshua Hempstead, the father of local diarist Joshua Hempsted. It is one of Connecticut's oldest surviving buildings, and has long been recognized for its architectural and historical significance, having been studied by Norman Isham and Frederick Kelly, prominent early architectural historians of the region. The house supposedly escaped destruction during the 1780 Battle of Groton Heights, in which much of New London was destroyed, because the Hempsteads had prepared a large family reunion meal, which was appropriated by the raiding British forces. It was used as a safe house as part of the Underground Railroad. It remained in the Hempstead family until 1937, when it was acquired by the organization now known as Connecticut Landmarks.

Restricted work in dioceses In the United States, after the sexual scandal regarding the founder, beginning in 2002 a few bishops restricted the Legion and Regnum Christi in Columbus, Ohio; St Paul- Minneapolis, Minnesota; Richmond, Virginia; and Miami, Florida.J. Filteau, , Catholic News Service (December-22-2004)S. Brewster, , Connecticut Record- Journal (September 18, 2004) In June 2008, the former Archbishop Edwin O'Brien of Baltimore began to require greater oversight of the Legion in his archdiocese.; ; He had particularly objected to its alleged practice of \\"blind allegiance\\", lack of \\"respect for human dignity for each of its members,\\" and \\"heavily persuasive methods on young people, especially high schoolers, regarding vocations.\\" He had since directed them to disclose all activities within the Archdiocese of Baltimore, and to refrain from spiritual direction with anyone under eighteen years of age. He later stated that the Legionaries fully complied with his orders. Since the outbreak of the scandal of the founder, the Legion of Christ underwent a Vatican investigation. This led to a renewal of the congregation under Cardinal De Paolis. In 2014, the five-year process culminated in a new set of constitutions and new leadership. Elitism and exclusivity Legionary seminaries said that students were from a broad variety of backgrounds. The congregation's mission was described as Christianizing society through the formation and evangelization of leaders.Jose de Cordoba, , The Wall Street Journal (January 23, 2006)G. Renner, , The National Catholic Reporter (November 3, 2000) The old Regnum Christi Member Handbook stated: \\"The Movement understands that for this action to be most effective it must give Christian formation to and apostolically mobilize the men and women that exercise greater leadership in society, in its religious, cultural, intellectual, social, economic, human, artistic, and other sectors.\\"Regnum Christi Member Handbook, #26. This Handbook has been revised since. Sexual abuse scandal The sexual scandal of the group's founder, Father Marcial Maciel, involved accusations that he sexually abused minors and fathered children. Marciel was a Mexican priest and the leader of the Legion of Christ for many decades. The scandal was linked with the wider series of Catholic sex abuse cases affecting the Catholic church. In March, 2010, the Legion of Christ in a communique acknowledged that \\"reprehensible actions\\" by Maciel, including sexual abuse actually happened. The communique stated that \\"given the gravity of his faults, we cannot take his person as a model of Christian or priestly life.\\" At first the Legion had denied allegations and since 2006 had not made an official statement one way or the other. =Formal denunciation of Maciel by the Vatican= In 2010 The Vatican named a delegate to review the Legionaries of Christ following revelations that the order's founder is suspected of abuse of minors and fathered at least three children. In a statement, the Vatican denounced the Rev. Marciel Maciel for creating a \\"system of power\\" that enabled him to lead an \\"immoral\\" double life \\"devoid of scruples and authentic religious sentiment.\\" The Vatican issued the statement after Pope Benedict XVI met with five bishops who investigated the Legion to determine its future.Pope names envoy, commission to reform Legionaries The Vatican statement was remarkable in its tough denunciation of Maciel's crimes and deception. The \\"very serious and objectively immoral acts\\" of Fr. Marcial Maciel which were \\"confirmed by incontrovertible testimonies\\" represent \\"true crimes and manifest a life without scruples or authentic religious sentiment,\\" the Vatican said. The Vatican said Fr. Marcial Maciel created a \\"mechanism of defense\\" around himself to shield him from accusations of abuse. \\"It made him untouchable,\\" the Vatican said. The statement decried \\"the lamentable disgracing and expulsion of those who doubted\\" Maciel's virtue. Actions taken by the current Legion leadership will be scrutinized; but no specific sanctions were mentioned. The Vatican acknowledged the \\"hardships\\" faced by Maciel's accusers through the years when they were ostracized or ridiculed, and commended their \\"courage and perseverance to demand the truth.\\" As a result of the visitation, Benedict XVI named Archbishop (now Cardinal) Velasio De Paolis as the Papal Delegate to oversee the Legion and its governance, and review the constitutions on July 9, 2010. ReGAIN lawsuit In August 2007, the Legion filed a lawsuit against ReGAIN, an organization founded by ex-Legionaries critical of Legion practices and its founder Marcial Maciel. The lawsuit alleges that written property of the Legion, including letters written by Maciel and copies of unpublished principles and norms \\"intended only for dissemination and use by Legion members\\" were stolen and posted online \\"out of context ... as part of a concerted effort to wage a malicious disinformation campaign against the Legion.\\" The Legion has pleaded that the value of the alleged stolen property is \\"worth at least $750,000.\\" The president of ReGAIN has asserted that, to the best of his knowledge, \\"nothing was obtained improperly,\\" and expressed the opinion that the lawsuit request for information on anonymous message board posters was an action \\"proving that the Legion is a cult which controls information, stifles freedom of expression, and goes after dissenters.\\" At the conclusion of the lawsuit, the internet discussion board xlcrc.com about the Legion and its activities was taken down.Daniela Deane, , The Washington Post (September 6, 2007) Apostolic visitation The controversies stem from the order's late founder, Fr. Marcial Maciel. The Vatican has ordered an apostolic visitation of the institutions of the Legionaries of Christ following disclosures of sexual impropriety by Fr. Marcial Maciel. The announcement of the unusual investigation by the Vatican was posted on the web site of the Legionaries of Christ on March 31, 2009, along with the text of a letter informing the Legionaries of the Pope's decision. On June 27, 2009, according to Vatican commentator Sandro Magister, Vatican authorities named five bishops from five different countries, each one in charge of investigating the Legionaries in a particular part of the world. They were Bishops Ricardo Watti Urquidi of Mexico, Charles J. Chaput of the United States, Giuseppe Versaldi of Italy, Ricardo Ezzati Andrello of Chile, and Ricardo Blázquez Pérez, (:es:Ricardo Blázquez) of Spain. Offshore Holdings in Tax Havens The Legion of Christ's multi-million dollar offshore holdings, long the source of speculation given the order's studied cultivation of wealthy donors and fast expansion, were revealed in the so-called Paradise Papers leak in November 2017.  Further cases of Sexual Abuse Sexual abuse by Fr. William Izquierdo admitted by the Legion = In December 2013, the National Catholic Register published a report on a statement by the Legion, admitting that an investigation concluded that Fr. Guillermo \\"William\\" Izquierdo, LC, had sexually abused a minor while director of novices at its center in Cheshire, CT, between 1982 and 1994. The minor involved was a novice under his guidance, and charges were not conclusively investigated until Fr. Luis Garza Medina, LC, then Territorial Director of North America, was informed in July 2012. Garza stated that Izquierdo's health had declined since 2008, through dementia, and that he was \\"unable to respond to questions about the allegations.\\" Izquierdo was one of the first seminarians recruited from Spain, along with an identical twin brother who as of 2013 was still in active ministry in South America. Sources inside the Legion say that both had been close to Maciel in the early years of the congregation and loyal to him during his removal on allegations of drug abuse, though it is not known if Maciel sexually abused them. Guillermo Izquierdo has also been accused of another instance of sexual abuse, though not of a minor. The alleged victim was also a novice under his guidance in Connecticut. = Sexual abuse accusations against Fr. Luis Garza and Fr. Jose Sabin = In October 2016, accusations against Fr. Luis Garza and Fr. Jose Sabin surfaced that they both sexually abused a teenage boy in the early 1990s at a Legion of Christ house of formation.

This may be used as a dummy load or as a starting resistor for large slip ring motors. In the simplest form it consists of a tank containing brine or other electrolyte solution, in which electrodes are submerged to create an electrical load. The electrodes may be raised or lowered into the liquid to respectively decrease or increase the electrical resistance of the load. To stabilize the load, the mixture must not be allowed to boil. Modern designs use stainless steel electrodes, and sodium carbonate, or other salts, and do not use the container as one electrode. In some designs the electrodes are fixed and the liquid is raised and lowered by an external cylinder or pump. Motor start systems used for frequent and rapid starts and re-starts, thus a high heat load to the rheostats, may include water circulation to external heat exchangers. In such cases anti-freeze and anti-corrosion additives must be carefully chosen to not change the resistance or support the growth of algae or bacteria. The salt water rheostat operates at unity power factor and presents a resistance with negligible series inductance compared to a wire wound equivalent, and was widely used by generator assemblers, until 20 years ago, as a matter of course. They are still sometimes constructed on-site for the commissioning of large diesel generators in remote places, where discarded oil drums and scaffold tubes may form an improvised tank and electrodes. Description Typically a traditional liquid rheostat consists of a steel cylinder (the negative), about in size, standing on insulators, in which was suspended a hollow steel cylinder. This acted as the positive electrode and was supported by a steel rope and insulator from an adjustable pulley. The water pipe connection included an insulated section. The tank contained salt water, but not at the concentration that could be described as “brine”. The whole device was fenced off for safety. Operation was very simple, as adding more salt, more water or varying the height of the centre electrode would vary the load. The load proved to be quite stable, varying only slightly as the water heated up. It never came to the boil. Power dissipation was about 1 megawatt, at a potential of about 700 volts and current of about 1,500 amperes. Modern designs use stainless steel electrodes, and sodium carbonate, or other salts, and do not use the container as one electrode. Systems with frequent starting may include water circulation to external heat exchangers. In such cases anti-freeze and anti-corrosion additives must be carefully chosen to not change the resistance or support the growth of algae or bacteria. Advantages and disadvantages An advantage is silent operation, with none of the fan noise of current resistive grid designs. Disadvantages include: * corrosion to the copper connection cables and to the wire rope * lack of insulation from ground which may trip a ground detection system Uses Railways commonly used salt water load banks in the 1950s to test the output power of diesel-electric locomotives.United States Army, Operation and Maintenance of Diesel-Electric Locomotives TM 55-202, 965, page 240 They were subsequently replaced by specially designed resistive load banks. These later designs, rated for , currently cost in the region of 100,000 to 180,000 euro. Hence, it is economically advantageous for railways to build their own salt- water type. Some electric locomotives also used liquid rheostats, in particular in Italy for early three-phase AC types such as the FS Class E550. Some direct current designs also used them as starting resistors. Liquid rheostats were sometimes used in large (thousands of kilowatts/horsepower) wound rotor motor drives, to control the rotor circuit resistance and so the speed of the motor. Electrode position could be adjusted with a small electrically operated winch or a pneumatic cylinder. A cooling pump and heat exchanger were provided to allow slip energy to be dissipated into process water or other water system.Igor Karassik et al, (ed), Pump Handbook Fourth Edition, Mc Graw Hill 2008, pages 9-113 -9-115 Current use High voltage distribution networks use fixed electrolyte resistors to ground the neutral, to provide a current limiting action, so that the voltage across the ground during fault is kept to a safe level. Unlike a solid resistor, the liquid resistor is self healing in the event of overload. Normally the resistance is set up during commissioning, and then left fixed.http://www.acrastyle.co.uk/products/liquid-neutral-earthing-resistors/ Modern motor starters http://www.aoip.com/product/epm/ are totally enclosed and the electrode movement is servo motor controlled. Typically a 1 tonne tank will start a 1 megawatt slip ring type motor, but there is considerable variation in start time depending on application. Safety issues with older designs The fully salt-water load bank dates from an earlier, less regulated and litigious era. To pass current safety legislation requires more enclosed designs. They are no more dangerous than electrode heaters, which work on the same principle, but with plain water, or electrical immersion heaters, provided the correct precautions are used. This requires connecting the container to both ground and neutral and breaking all poles with a linked over-current circuit breaker. If in the open, safety barriers are required.

As he did in his Southern Writers book Spielman works quickly, usually one on one, as he feels more people there causes distractions for the subject. Therefore, allowing an intimate and personal exchange between the subject and photographer. thumb Katrinaville Chronicles is Spielman's start to a long-term photographic essay about Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. Not being a “hard news” guy, his approach was that of an observer trying to document what happened to his city, New Orleans. Working slowly and very deliberately he traversed the city searching for images that would tell a story. Spielman always attempts to render the best possible image leaving his biases out of the way. This book also includes his e-mails to family and friends. Never thinking that his words and observations would be part of a book. It was just his first person account of what he was seeing and feeling after the storm when the city was almost void of people. He modeled his work after that of the wonderful photographers who documented the Great Depression and Dust Bowl. This was his WPA; the only difference was there was no government funding, no editors to help tell them where to go. He was on his own, shooting and funding his work without any outside help. The Katrina Decade is a book and major exhibition with the Historic New Orleans Collection, documenting the ten years after Hurricane Katrina. Spielman continued to photograph New Orleans post storm, documenting areas and neighborhoods that may be missed by someone less familiar with New Orleans. With much rebuilding in progress, the recovery didn’t reach and include everyone and every place. The book shows houses completely vine- covered and structures stripped of any and all valuable architectural details. A melancholy beauty with a haunting air overtook many parts of the city. The Historic New Orleans Collected hosted a major tenth-anniversary show of Spielman’s Katrina work.  Gallery and museum showcases  Spielman’s work continues to be collected throughout the U.S., Europe and Asia. The Historic New Orleans Collection and the Ogden Museum of the South both have many of his images in their permanent collections. He also continues to give lectures, talks and workshops about all of his work. Spielman maintains a gallery in the historic Garden District, where his photos can be viewed year around.

The purpose of the experiment was to get kinaesthetic feedback rather than guidance through external stimuli through maze learning. It was conducted in 1907 by John B. Watson and Harvey A. Carr and was named after the sound the rat made after running into the end of the maze. The study would help form a chain of responses hypothesis proposed by Watson. The studies findings would later give credibility to stimulus and response interpretations that rewards work by strengthening the learned ability to show a habitual motor action in the presence of a particular stimulus. The experiment Rats were trained to run in a straight, alley like maze for a food reward which was located at the end of the alley. Watson found that once the rat was well trained, it performed almost automatically on reflex. Upon learning the maze over time, they started to run faster through each length and turn. By the stimulus of the maze, their behavior became a series of associated movements, or kinaesthetic consequences instead of stimulus from the outside world. This routine continued until the length of the path changed, either farther or shorter. If the conditioned rats were released into an alleyway or path that was shortened, they would run straight into the end of the wall making a \\"kerplunk\\" sound. The first trial found that they would run full speed, passing up the food that had been moved closer. Shortening the alleyway, and moving the food closer was an early signal that was ignored by the rats. If the path was longer, the rats would run as usual until it reached their customary distance, the distance at which the food would normally be. They would then pause to sniff the area even though they had not reached the end of the alley, often ignoring food that was farther away.

When Vramshapuh succeeded his brother Khosrov IV in 389Hovannisian, The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century, p.85 as Sasanian client king of Arsacid Armenia, Vramshapuh assumed this name in compliment to the Sasanian shah Bahram IV. The names Bahram and Shapur were dynastic names of the ruling Sasanian dynasty and demonstrate the cultural influence that the Sasanians had on the remaining Arsacid Armenian monarchs living in Persia. Family background The exact origins of Vramshapuh are unknown. The Armenian Historian Ghazar Parpetsi who lived between the 5th and 6th centuries, whose work was History of Armenia presents Vramshapuh as a prince from the Arsacid dynasty, without mentioning his parentage. Ghazar Parpetsi also names him as the brother of Khosrov IV and the father of Artaxias IV (Artashir IV). According to modern genealogies, Vramshapuh is presented as being one of the sons of Varasdates (Varazdat).Toumanoff, Manual genealogy and chronology for the Christian Caucasus (Armenia, Georgia, Albania), p.76 Vramshapuh was born and raised in Armenia and little is known of his life prior to his kingship. Rise to the throne Sometime in 389 Bahram IV, dethroned Khosrov IV and placed him in confinement in Ctesiphon. Bahram IV was unsatisfied with Khosrov IV. Bahram IV considered Khosrov IV, as being too assertive in his royal authority as a governing Client Monarch and did various acts in his kingship without consultation from the Sasanian dynasty. The Armenians requested to the Sasanian shah another king of Armenia from the Arsacid dynasty.Ghazar Parpetsi, History of Armenia, 5th to 6th century Bahram IV agreeing to their request, enthroned VramshapuhGhazar Parpetsi, History of Armenia, 5th to 6th century as the new Sasanian Client King of Arsacid Armenia. After his brother, Vramshapuh served as the second Sasanian client King of Arsacid Armenia. Not much is known of his relationship with Khosrov IV.

Sahak the son of Nerses who was the last Gregorian PatriarchHovannisian, The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century, p.92 served as the Armenian Catholicos (Patriarch) during Vramshapuh's reign. Sahak and Vramshapuh were distantly related as Sahak's late paternal grandmother was the Arsacid Princess Bambish. Bambish was a sister to king Tigranes VII (Tiran)Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians and a daughter of king Khosrov III. Vramshapuh maintained peaceful relations between the Byzantine Empire and the Sasanian Empire.Ouzounian, The Heritage of Armenian Literature: From the Oral Tradition to the Golden Age, p.160 He is also known for his successful peace mission to Mesopotamia to mediate between Persia and Byzantium.Ouzounian, The Heritage of Armenian Literature: From the Oral Tradition to the Golden Age, p.160 Vramshapuh succeeded in winning the confidence of the Sasanian shah as well as the Armenians who were pro-Roman. Through maintaining good relations and restoring peace to both empires, Vramshapuh was able to establish a long peace which contributed to the internal improvement of the region into which Christianity was able to penetrate, which kept the spread of pagan faiths to a minimum.Encyclopædia Britannica (1890-1907) The Sasanian shah Yazdegerd I, ratified Sahak as the Armenian Catholicos in which Vramshapuh promoted Sahak's son-in-law to the high office of general. This title which was part of his heritage was for a long time withheld from him. Vramshapuh appointed his prerogatives as were those of the Mardpet, the guardian of his harem (who was also the administrator of the Royal domain) and the Apset who placed the crown on Vramshapuh's head at his coronation. In his kingship, Vramshapuh was wise, beneficent and his reign was illustrious.

After the death of Vramshapuh, Sahak visited the court of the Sasanian shah Yazdegerd I in releasing Khosrov IV from political exile. Yazdegerd I consented with Sahak in releasing Khosrov IV from imprisonment.Kurkjian, A History of Armenia, p.112 When Khosrov IV was released from political exile, there is a possibility he may have served again as king of Armenia from 417 until about 418.Hovannisian, The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century, p.85 The possible second reign of Khosrov IV, may have only lasted up to a year, as he died in 418.Hovannisian, The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century, p.85 From 417 til 422 Armenia was under direct rule of the Nakharars and the Sasanian dynasty.

Having consistently met and exceeded TRAI benchmarks, Loop Mobile was ISO 9001:2008 certified in 2009, in accordance with the TUV NORD CERT auditing and certification procedures. On 18 February 2014, Bharti Airtel announced that it was acquiring Loop Mobile for , prior to that, a Chennai-based Information Technology Company, Zeesta IT Services MD Hemanth Raj, evaluated to acquire, however the deal did not materialize . The two companies had been in talks since mid-2013. Loop Mobile's 20-year licence in the 900 MHz band was due to expire in the last quarter of 2014, and the company did not participate in the 2014 spectrum auction. However, on 5 November 2014, Bharti announced that it was dropping plans to acquire Loop Mobile, after the former failed to gain regulatory approval from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for the acquisition.http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/bharti- calls-off-rs-700-cr-deal-to-buy-loop- mobile-114110600045_1.htmlhttp://www.livemint.com/Companies/RDMdCDjHO2wluCzuYWT2bN/Bharti- Airtel-pulls-out-of-deal-says-Loop-Mobile.html The acquisition would have increased Airtel's total customer base in Mumbai to more than 7 million customers and increased the size of their network to 6,500 cell sites. Airtel also would have acquired electronic equipment, optic fibre and the 8 megahertz of spectrum in the 900 MHz band held by Loop in Mumbai. However, Airtel had no plans to acquire Loop Mobile's 550 employees. The announcement of the acquisition had prompted most Loop Mobile subscribers to switch mobile operators, and the operator had approximately 1 million customers by the first week of November 2014, down from 3 million subscribers when the deal was first announced in February 2014. Loop Mobile's licence to operate mobile services in Mumbai expired on 29 November 2014, bringing an end to its operations. Controversy Loop Telecom was probed by CBI for alleged violation of foreign exchange laws to the tune of about 384 crores in connection with the 2G spectrum case. As far as the lengthy Indian Court process was concerned, the media and political controversies did not appear to be substantive. The promoters of Loop telecom were acquitted in December 2017 by an emphatic decision of the competent Indian Court, which stated \\"prosecution has miserably failed to prove any charge against any of the accused. Consequently, all the accused are entitled to be acquitted\\". On 18 August 2011, Loop mobile along with Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular, Reliance Communications and Vodafone was issued notices by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) for violation of Mobile number portability (MNP) Regulations. According to TRAI, they had received complains from customers regarding wrong rejection of porting requests by telecom operators and also 10 been charged for a message for requesting porting code through number 1900.

Plot An elite group of Special Operations soldiers led by Mack (Cuba Gooding Jr.), are sent by a CIA agent named Elissa Cardell (Valerie Cruz) to rescue her father, a scientist named Wesley (Ron Perlman), who is working on an archaeological dig in the Middle Eastern desert. When they enter the dig site, which is a large underground laboratory, they encounter a priest who has strange boils all over his body. The team's medic, Doc (Taryn Manning), sedates the priest. Click (Brandon Fobbs) uses the dig site's terminal to activate the elevator and notices something codenamed the Gehenna Project. He asks Cardell if she knows what it is but she denies knowing about it. Mack orders Nickels (Zack Ward) to stay and watch the priest while the rest of the team takes the elevator deeper into the dig site. When they exit the elevator they encounter a scientist named Duncan (Bill Moseley), who has strange boils like the priest. Duncan attacks Hammer (Franky G) but is shot in the chest by Mack. While treating Duncan's wound, Doc has a hallucination of her sister angry at her for letting her die. Duncan and Doc disappear but the team uses Doc's tracking device to follow them. The team splits up and Yoshi (Stephanie Jacobsen) follows a hallucination of her and Hicks's (Jason London) unborn daughter. The team runs into Duncan, who is trying to open the door to the safe room. Duncan yells at the team about their ignorance of salvation and Mack shoots him in the head, which strangely doesn't kill him, but when the entire team shoots him he finally dies. The door to the safety room is opened from the inside, revealing a priest named Fulton (Henry Rollins), who Cardell knows, and who tells them that Doc was probably taken to the temple; he agrees to take them there. The team notices that Yoshi is missing and, when they find her, she tells them of her hallucination. Fulton explains that the possessed use visions to tempt humans. Mack then duct tapes Fulton's mouth shut. Nickels hallucinates a nude woman and he is attacked by the priest; he fights back with a knife but has his arm broken and the priest spits a dark fluid into his mouth, then drags him away. Click is separated from the team and encounters Doc locked in a room; when he tries to help her he is attacked by a possessed scientist. Hammer shows up and rescues Click, but more possessed start to appear, Hammer decides to throws explosives at the group, causing the passage to collapse. Fulton and the team arrive at the temple, where they learn from Fulton and Cardell that the scientists are possessed because they absorbed the spirit of one of the Nephilim, which is frozen in the temple, to prevent it from escaping. Fulton explains that the dig site is one of many tombs created by God to imprison Nephilim. Yoshi follows the hallucination to Doc, who is revealed to be possessed. She seduces Yoshi and allows her to lick strange, infectious boils on her shoulder, infecting her. Doc then cuts her back open. When the team notices that Yoshi is missing, Hicks and Hammer try to find her. During their search, a possessed Doc attacks Hammer, who aims his gun at her after he notices that she has developed boils. Hicks points his gun at Hammer, who tries to tell Hicks that Doc is possessed. Hicks doesn't believe him and shoots at Hammer, who manages to run away. Hicks then chases Doc and finds Yoshi, whose spine is exposed. He tries to help her but she attacks him, and then Doc rips his throat out. Hammer arrives back at the temple to tell Mack about Doc and Hicks. Fulton realizes that, with Click's unintentional help, Cardell activated the Gehenna Project, which is a self-destruct device for the dig site. He runs for the elevator alone. The soldiers only have fifteen minutes to get to the elevator before the explosion. The door to the temple slowly starts closing. Mack, Cardell, and Click make it out of the temple but Hammer gets locked in and, surrounded by possessed scientists, he puts up a fight, but he is overwhelmed and sets off his grenades, killing himself and the possessed scientists attacking him. Fulton is pushed into barbed wire by Doc, who then slits his throat. Mack, Cardell, and Click arrive at the area where they encountered Duncan for the first time, and they meet up with Wesley, who is possessed but doesn't have the boils. Doc and Nickels, who is now possessed, arrive and Mack and Click shoot him and a few other possessed until the possessed priest grabs Click, drags him away and kills him. Mack has a hallucination of his old best friend Blakeley (Ray Winstone), who Mack was ordered to murder years ago. Mack resists and shoots an explosive barrel next to Wesley which burns him and kills Doc, along with the hallucination of Blakeley. Cardell stands over Wesley and sets his soul free. When Mack tells her that they have to leave she refuses, saying that her goal was to set her father's soul free. Mack makes it to the elevator alone and escapes from the dig site seconds before the explosion. Mack is then picked up by the helicopter and realizes that he has a new purpose in the world, that he is a new soldier in an ancient war.

The aircraft flew well but the concept was abandoned and only one was built. Development The Vickers 161 was designed in response to Air Ministry specification F.29/27. This called for an interceptor fighter operating as a stable gun platform for the COW 37 mm gun produced by the Coventry Ordnance Works (COW) that fired 23 oz (0.65 kg) shells. The gun was to be mounted at 45 degrees or more above the horizontal, so that the aircraft could fly below the target bomber or airship, and fire upwards into it. During World War II the Luftwaffe used a rather similar approach, named Schräge Musik. The specification also called for a top speed well in excess of a typical bomber's cruising speed and a good rate of climb. Vickers' approach seems to have been influenced by their World War I experience with the Gunbus family. Like them, the Type 161 was a single-engined pusher biplane. The wings were of unequal span and parallel chord, mounted with heavy stagger and a large gap braced in two-bay fashion by streamlined I form, outward leaning interplane struts. Parallel booms, formed on each side by a pair of tubular members, converged from the top and bottom of the inner interplane struts onto the tail. Another pair of tubes joined the bottom of the interplane struts to the upper boom at midpoint. The tailplane had a wide span, extending past the booms; the fin and rudder were conventional and stiffened with lighter bracing to mid-boom. Flying surfaces were fabric covered. left The pilot and gun were housed in a metal monocoque nacelle mounted to the underside of the upper wing, leaving a gap below. The pilot's cockpit was offset to port with the gun to his right, its breech accessible. The Bristol Jupiter VIIF was installed with its cylinders in line with the rear edge of the upper wing, supported by two pairs of struts to the lower wing spars and driving a four-blade propeller. This had an unusual ring fairing that rotated with it and matched the engine cowling in diameter. Aft, and without a break, a fuselage-like fairing ran rearwards, narrowing to the tail. This structure was stabilized on each side by a pair of struts to the upper and lower booms. A split-axle undercarriage had legs to the fuselage and, rearwards, to the forward wing spar, with a strut between their upper joints. The Type 161 flew for the first time on 21 January 1931. Further flight trials produced some modifications, largely to improve yaw stability. The rudder was broadened and rounded at the top, and small fins were added above and below the tailplane at the boom mounting point. There were also alterations to the geometry and gearing of the elevator trim tabs: it has been suggested that the Type 161 may have been the first aircraft to have had inflight adjustable elevator trims. In September 1931 it went to RAF Martlesham Heath for trials, where no serious problems emerged and pilot's reports were positive. The gun-firing tests went well, with no detriment to airframe or performance. Despite that, neither the Type 161 or its competitor the Westland C.O.W. Gun Fighter were ordered and no more was heard of the aerial COW gun.

Thacher Montessori is accredited by the Association of Independent Schools of New England.  History  Thacher Montessori School was founded in 1971 in a single classroom by Maureen Coughlan. Her vision for a school dedicated to true Montessori principles resulted in steady growth. With support from her diverse and committed community of families and a growing student population, Thacher moved into its current home at 1425 Blue Hill Avenue in 1989. The building was designed to be a Montessori learning environment with easy access to the outdoors, plenty of natural light and a floor plan well-suited for children. In spring 2008, Thacher embarked on a building program to add a second floor to the building. This project was completed in fall 2008. In 2008, Thacher attained a classic Montessori structure of four Children's House, three Lower Elementary, two Upper Elementary and one Adolescent Program classrooms. The addition of the toddler program, also in 2008, was the culmination of the vision for a complete school providing traditional Montessori education.  Montessori Education  Dr. Maria Montessori developed the Montessori Method of education over a century ago. Her theory of education was based on her knowledge of child development and the sensitive periods children go through as they acquire and process information. Montessori education at Thacher provides the framework in which children can work together and learn from one another; creativity is encouraged and independence is balanced by self- discipline. Thacher students using Montessori materials.  Programs  TODDLER PROGRAM (18 months to 3 years old) Thacher's Toddler Community classroom embraces Dr. Maria Montessori's philosophy by providing safe, structured, indoor and outdoor spaces where toddlers explore and learn. The adults in the environment are the children's models. Through peaceful voices and calm interaction a serene environment in which children can pursue their work. CHILDREN'S HOUSE (3 to 6 years old) Thacher's three-year curriculum offers hands-on experiences in practical life, sensorial activities, language, Spanish, science, math, music and movement, and cultural studies. Each classroom has immediate access to the outdoor environment for gardening, nature study, picnics, and play time. Respecting others grace and courtesy is the foundation for social and personal interaction throughout Thacher as modeled by the guides (teachers). LOWER ELEMENTARY (6 to 9 years old) Elementary classrooms maintain a balance of freedom and responsibility. Children have the freedom to make choices about their work. At the same time, the children are responsible for doing work that is productive and of high quality. Children enjoy work in groups, which leads to discussion, disagreement, and compromise. UPPER ELEMENTARY (9 to 12 years old) In the Upper Elementary classroom, students are able to think more abstractly, engage more independently with their surroundings, and produce a greater quantity and quality of work. At the Upper Elementary level students are guided and supported in independent learning. The Montessori philosophy addresses the challenges of the pre-adolescent by helping the children develop the confidence to face the social, emotional, and societal pressures of their age. ADOLESCENT PROGRAM (12 to 15 years old) The academic program uses an integrated curriculum and a block class schedule to prepare the students for competitive high schools. Students run several businesses, conduct community service, work on a farm, and complete business internships as means to build self-confidence.  Enrichment Programs  Program includes Art, Spanish, Music, Physical Education, Skiing, Camping, Visiting Artists and After School Enrichment. Thacher students in gymnasium.  Summer Programs  Thacher offers summer programs for Toddlers through 8th graders.  Non-Discrimination Statement  Thacher is nonsectarian Montessori school that does not discriminate against individuals on the basis of race, creed, religion, national origin, cultural heritage, age, gender, marital status, political beliefs, disability, sexual orientation, or family style in its admissions, employment policies, and procedures.

He is perhaps best known for his pioneering work with Rhone varietals in California and for popularizing the use of screw caps on premium wines.

Biography Randall was born in Los Angeles in 1953 and attended UC Santa Cruz where he was \\"a permanent Liberal Arts major.\\" He eventually began working at the Wine Merchant in Beverly Hills sweeping floors. There he had the opportunity to taste great French wines and the experience turned him into \\"a complete and insufferable wine fanatic. He returned to the University of California at Davis to complete a degree in Plant Sciences in 1979, where he developed a \\"single-minded obsession with Pinot Noir\\" With his family’s assistance, Grahm purchased property in Bonny Doon, in the Santa Cruz Mountains where he was intent on producing \\"The Great American Pinot Noir.\\" Although he initially had trouble with Pinot, he was encouraged by experimental batches of Rhône varieties, and he has been a tireless champion of Rhône grapes since the inaugural vintage of Le Cigare Volant in 1986. In 1989 Randall appeared on the cover of the Wine Spectator, clad in blue polyester, as \\"The Rhône Ranger,\\" a moniker that has followed him ever since.

Situated in the suburb of Headingley, Cottage Road was originally built in 1905 as a garage for the nearby Castle Grove mansion. Local newsreel cameraman Owen Brooks leased the garage with his friend George Reginald 'Reg' Smith and the two converted the building into a cinema, which opened as 'Headingley Picture House' on Monday, 29 July 1912. The cinema changed hands in the late 1930s, ultimately being purchased by Associated Tower Cinemas, who changed its name to Cottage Road Cinema and undertook building work. Associated Tower invested £20,000 to modernise the cinema in 1972, but announced that Cottage Road would close on 28 July 2005, due to unsustainable financial losses. The cinema was saved by a last minute bid from Charles Morris's Northern Morris Group. Under Northern Morris's ownership, Cottage Road celebrated its 100th birthday on 29 July 2012, with a Leeds Civic Trust blue plaque being unveiled by screenwriter Kay Mellor. Aiming to provide \\"cinema-going as it used to be\\", Cottage Road shows a mix of family-friendly films alongside classic movies, with ice creams being sold in the auditorium during the interval before films begin, and the national anthem being played at the end of each evening. History  Cottage Road Cinema was originally built in 1905 (on the site of a former stable block) as a garage for H.R. Kirk, a Leeds textile merchant and owner of the nearby Castle Grove mansion. Pioneering Leeds-born newsreel cameraman Owen Brooks rented the garage several years later and, in partnership with his friend and fellow motoring enthusiast George Reginald 'Reg' Smith, converted it into a cinema. This 590-seat cinema opened as 'Headingley Picture House' on Monday, 29 July 1912, with tickets costing sixpence, or one shilling for reserved seating. Smith died in 1922, after which Brooks and Smith's widow, along with a new partner, bought the freehold of the property from the Kirk family. Two years later Brooks left the business and, following a one-week closure in 1931 to install sound equipment at the end of the silent film era, Headingley Picture House was purchased in 1937 by entrepreneur Frank T. Thompson. The cinema changed hands again the following year, with Associated Tower Cinemas taking over ownership and renaming it 'Cottage Road Cinema'. Associated Tower added a balcony to the auditorium and, around this time, the building was also re-fronted. Cottage Road continued to show films through the 'talkies' boom of the 1930s and 40s and the advent of colour until a major renovation in 1972, when £20,000 was spent modernising the cinema. The cinema re-opened on Boxing Day 1972 with a screening of Diamonds Are Forever. Further improvements were made in 1982 when Cinemeccanica Victoria 8 projectors, taken from the Grove cinema in Smethwick, were installed. By 2005 Cottage Road's fortunes had waned and Associated Tower, who disposed of Headingley's other historic cinema, The Lounge, in January of that year, announced that the venue would close on 28 July, one day shy of its 93rd birthday. In statements to the BBC, Associated Tower variously claimed that the cinema was losing £100,000 a year and between £1,000 and £2,000 a month due to \\"competition from multiplexes\\" and that it was no longer viable as a business. Despite protests from local residents, staff were issued with redundancy notices and Cottage Road was set to close its doors as planned until a last minute buyout was agreed with Charles Morris's Northern Morris Group, who paid a “nominal fee” to secure an initial nine-year lease. Morris claimed that he \\"couldn't resist\\" attempting to save the cinema given that it had \\"survived when so many other cinemas had succumbed to bingo halls and supermarkets due to competition from television, video and other entertainment\\", but warned that the local community would need to attend showings regularly to ensure Cottage Road's continued survival. Cottage Road Cinema's blue plaque Cottage Road regained its alcohol licence under Northern Morris ownership and, a year on from its acquisition, Charles Morris told the Yorkshire Evening Post that he was happy with sales at the cinema, stating that \\"it's doing particularly well really as it's been a bad year for cinemas generally\\" and pointing to a sold-out showing of the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale as a highlight. In 2008 the cinema received a National Lottery grant from the UK Film Council for roof repairs and, on 29 July 2012, a Leeds Civic Trust blue plaque was unveiled by Leeds-born screenwriter Kay Mellor to commemorate its 100th anniversary. Local poet Linda Marshall gave a special tribute entitled \\"Havoc In Far Headingley\\" after the plaque was unveiled, before the 1957 comedy The Smallest Show on Earth was shown. 100th birthday celebrations continued with more classic films, including a screening of Singin' in the Rain introduced by Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, and culminated with a silent film showing with live musical accompaniment, in conjunction with the Leeds International Film Festival. Leeds North West MP Greg Mulholland tabled an early day motion in the House of Commons, calling on his fellow politicians to congratulate \\"Leeds' oldest cinema in continuous use [...] as it celebrates the centenary of its founding\\" along with Charles Morris and the Northern Morris Group for their role in saving Cottage Road and \\"similar historic cinemas up and down the country\\". Present day Although it has digital projectors and Dolby Surround 7.1 sound, Cottage Road retains its wood-panelled lobby and aims to provide \\"cinema-going as it used to be\\". Ice creams are sold in the auditorium during the interval before films begin, and the national anthem is played at the end of each evening. Every six weeks, the cinema hosts 'Classics at the Cottage' events, where classic movies, often introduced by owner Charles Morris, are shown. Cottage Road's regular programme includes films that appeal to young children and families — according to Morris \\"Nightmare on Elm Street isn't for Cottage Road. We're lucky to have very loyal and appreciative audiences, and we try to give them what they want\\". Cottage Road has 466 seats, and cinemagoers can choose between regular stalls seating or larger and more comfortable 'Pullman seats', situated in the centre of the cinema, which offer a view of the screen unobstructed by other patrons.

Note fuselage code \\"ST\\". : for the civilian airport, see Stuttgart Municipal Airport, for the current US Army installation in Germany see Stuttgart Army Airfield (Germany) Stuttgart Army Airfield is a former World War II military airfield, located 7 miles north of Stuttgart, Arkansas. It operated as an advanced pilot training school for the United States Army Air Forces from 1942 until 1945.  History  Stuttgart Municipal Airport dates to 1942 when it was built by the United States Army Air Forces as a training airfield as part of the 70,000 Pilot Training Program. It was one of many air fields created in the country’s interior during the war. The airfield consisted of four main 5'000 ft concrete and asphalt runways, aligned 01/19; 05/23; 09/27 and 13/31. Military Airfields in WW2 In addition to the main airfield, seven axillary fields were constructed to support the training mission. Those were located as follows: * Stuttgart AAF Auxiliary #1 (Carlisle) * Stuttgart AAF Auxiliary #2 (Hazen) * Stuttgart AAF Auxiliary #5 (Almyra) The locations of auxiliaries #3 (Roe), #4, #6 and #7 (Stuttgart) are undetermined. The school and airfield was activated on 15 August 1942 and used by the Army Air Forces Training Command. Initially it was used as a glider pilot training school using Waco CG-4A gliders. AFHRA Document 00178774, STUTTGART ARMY AIRFIELD ARStuttgart Army Air Field, Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture In 1943 the airfield was transferred to Southeast Training Command as an advanced twin-engine flying school and glider training ceased on 19 May 1943.Manning, Thomas A.

Air Force Combat Units Of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History. . With the end of World War II, the airfield was placed on standby status in early 1946, and turned over to Air Technical Service Command (ATSC). ATSC's mission was to remove all usable military equipment from the property and dispose of items which no longer had a useful need. Like many other surplus airfields around the country, public sales were held to offer the material to the public. Stuttgart Army Airfield was declared excess and closed on 5 August 1946. It was conveyed though the War Assets Administration (WAA) to the City of Stuttgart to establish a municipal airport. Current status Today, the former training field is a general aviation airport, serving the local area. Most of the World War II runways are closed, two still remaining in use as a main and as a crosswind runway. The massive parking apron remains, mostly unused, and sections of unused taxiways and runways remain, some partially removed for hardcore. The large station area is completely obliterated, the wartime streets removed; the buildings long torn down or moved with a few concrete foundations remaining in the large grassy area. Ghostly outlines of streets can be seen in aerial imagery. The military hangars on the flightline are gone, their concrete floors visible and exposed to the elements.

These are sacoglossan (sap-sucking) sea snails, and many of them are green in color. These snails are extremely unusual in that their shells consist of two separate hinged pieces or valves. The valves are joined by a ligament, and look nothing like a normal snail shell; instead the valves look almost exactly like the two hinged valves of a clam, a bivalve mollusk, which is a related but very different class of mollusks. Up until the mid-20th century, the Juliidae were known only from fossil shells, and not surprisingly, these fossils were interpreted as being the shells of bivalves. Julia, which is the type genus of the family, was named in 1862 by Augustus Addison Gould, who described it as a bivalve genus. Julliidae are known from the Eocene period to the Recent, but they probably first appeared during the Paleocene.  Taxonomy as \\"bivalves\\"  These bivalved gastropods were for a long time only known from fossils and dead material. Because of this, they had been described as being somewhat atypical bivalves. In the late 19th century they were classified among the bivalves, within the family Mytilidae, the mussels.George Washington Tryon, Jr. (1884). Structural and systematic conchology: an introduction to the study of the Mollusca. Volume III. Philadelphia, published by the author, page 267. The similarity of the shells of Juliidae to those of bivalves does not mean that these snails are closely related to bivalves; this is an example of convergent evolution.  Discovery of live animals  Until the mid-20th century, these creatures were still considered to be bivalves. Then, in 1959, living individuals of one species were collected on the green alga, Caulerpa, in Japan. It was immediately clear that these animals were, in fact, unusual gastropods with a two-part shell. The first-discovered live species of bivalved gastropod was Tamanovalva limax, described by Kawaguti & Baba (1959). Once the habitat, appearance, and life habits of these very small and inconspicuous animals were understood, researchers in subsequent years were able to find a number of other species and genera in different parts of the world, also living on various species of Caulerpa.  2005 taxonomy  This family is within the clade Sacoglossa (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005). The family Juliidae consists of the following subfamilies (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005): * subfamily Juliinae E. A. Smith, 1885 - synonym: Prasinidae Stoliczka, 1871 * subfamily Bertheliniinae Keen & A. G. Smith, 1961Keen & Smith A. G. (1961).

Drawing of the interior of the right valve of the shell of \\"Julia borbonica\\". As Tryon (1884) wrote in his description of the genus Julia: the shell is oblong, thick, and cordiform. The valves are closed, the margins entire and the valves are inequilateral. The lunule is deep circular, projecting into the interior of the right valve, the left valve is in the same place furnished with dentiform tubercles. The hinge line is simple and arched. The ligament is external and narrow. There are two muscle scars which are unequal and subcentral. These animals have two valves, and the soft parts can be completely withdrawn inside the shell. de Bruyne R. H. (2004). Encyklopedie ulit a lastur. Rebo Productions, 336 pp., , page 223. The two valves are usually thin and translucent. In the genus Tamanovalva there is a protoconch on the apex of the left valve. This is clearly visible in the left valve of Tamanovalva babai. The body of the live animals is in most cases green (as it is in many sacoglossans), and in many species the individual appears green in totality. This, combined with the very small overall size, makes the animal hard to see on the green algae on which it lives. This ability serves as crypsis, especially as cryptic coloration (camouflage). In two species and the camouflage is even more complete: the mantle of the animal is patterned in a way that very closely resembles the structure of the alga on which it lives. The empty valves of the shells of these animals are in some cases green, in other cases brownish-green or yellow, and in yet others, colorless. The species Julia zebra has shells that are finely striped with brown and blotched with white.http://seaslugsofhawaii.com/species/Julia-zebra-b.html  Ecology  Distribution = Species in this family occur in all tropical zone seas and all temperate zone seas. = Life cycle = After hatching, the juvenile snails immediately take their place on algae (the larval phase of veliger is extremely short). = Feeding habits = Juliidae feed on green algae of the genus Caulerpa. Some species of Juliidae feed only on one species of Caulerpa; others feed on multiple species of this green alga.  Genera  The type genus of the family Juliidae is Julia Gould, 1862.

Such a wound is not strictly speaking a bite, as the forcipules are a modified first pair of legs rather than true mouthparts. Clinically, the wound is viewed as a cutaneous condition characterized by paired hemorrhagic marks that form a chevron shape caused by the paired forcipules. The centipede's venom causes pain and swelling in the area of the bite, and may cause other reactions throughout the body. The majority of bites are not life- threatening to humans and present the greatest risk to children and those who develop allergic reactions. Symptoms Symptoms which are most likely to develop include: * severe pain, which is usually proportional to the size of the centipede * swelling and redness * skin necrosis * local bleeding * swollen, painful lymph nodes in the regions of the bitten limb * headache * palpitations or a racing pulse * nausea and vomiting, although this is rare * local itching and burning sensations. The pain caused by centipede bites is often described as comparable to pain from scorpion stings and snakebites. However, unlike scorpions and snakes, for which certain species can be much more venomous than others, the venom toxicity of centipedes appears to be more uniform across all species. Therefore, the amount and intensity of pain from centipede bites tends to be strongly correlated to the size of the centipede, which is further enhanced by the fact that larger centipedes have larger forcipules that can inject venom deeper into the skin. The wound left by the bite may be accompanied by swelling, redness, and small puncture wounds which may form a circular pattern. This wound may be susceptible to local ulcerations and necrosis. Severe bite from larger species may cause a dangerous and life-threatening anaphylaxis if not treated. Infections may also occur. Treatment Immediate treatment consists of rinsing the bite site in cold water. If not too painful, ice the bite site. This constricts the blood vessels so the venom does not spread. Also recommended is papain, an enzyme that breaks down protein. Papain can be found in meat tenderizer and papaya. This deactivates the majority of the centipede venom's proteins. Depending on the type of centipede and level of envenomation, this treatment may not degrade the entire venom dose and residual pain will remain. Individuals who are bitten by centipedes are sometimes given a urine test to check for muscle tissue breakdown and/or an EKG to check for heart and vascular problems. Reassurance and pain relief is often given in the form of painkillers, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, antihistamines and anti-anxiety medications. In a severe case the affected limb can be elevated and diuretic medications can be administered. Wound care principles and sometimes antibiotics are used to keep the wound itself from becoming infected or necrotic. In Barbados, a folk remedy involves applying a freshly cut onion to the site of the injury.  Famous case(s)  Naturalist Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre reported that his dog died from a centipede bite during travels in Mauritius.Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, Voyage à l'Isle de France, à l'Isle de Bourbon, au Cap de Bonne-Espérance, etc. avec des observations nouvelles sur la nature et sur les hommes (Paris: 1773), p. 128.

It tells the story of her father Major Ben Wheeler when he was captured by the Japanese during the Second World War. The film also shows the Japanese perspective as it shows the harsh, inhuman treatment of the POWs. During that time, A Japanese soldier would kill himself before allowing himself to be taken prisoner. This cultural difference caused the Japanese to look at captured soldiers as having no honour. At the end of the film, as the Americans arrived to liberate the camps, many of the Japanese guards at the camp committed suicide rather than become prisoners. Plot Major Ben Wheeler was a Canadian doctor assigned to Singapore when the Japanese forced an unconditional surrender of the British in 1942. The movie recounts, through the pages of his diary, the traumatic experiences of himself and his comrades as POWs in the Kinkaseki POW camp (a mining labour camp in northern Taiwan). The story is conveyed from two perspectives: the narration of Ben Wheeler's diary (by Donald Sutherland) with dramatized scenes of life in the camp and archival footage of related events, and the vivid, personal stories of Dr. Wheeler's surviving fellow POWs. The film flashes between the story of the camp and Wheeler's family life before and after the war, as well as interviews of the survivors giving perspectives of the events described by Dr Wheeler. Dr Wheeler is the protagonist who is portrayed as the major reason the other British POWs survived, both physically and mentally. This is affirmed by his overarching concern for his men in his writing, other than longing for his wife and family, with the exception of his love and longing for his family. Evidence of feats, compassion and selflessness are also abundantly given by the interviewees, who all owed their lives to him. Although the Japanese captors are no doubt the cruel and humiliating antagonists, the film does not demonize them. In fact, the final interviewee provides some insightful revelation on how he and his comrades perceive their captors, and the effect of his experience on his life.

It was a type of Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) mission, primarily intended to suppress Soviet-supplied surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems in North Vietnam, although neutralizing radar-directed anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) was important as well. \\"Iron Hand\\" refers both to the development of the tactics and equipment, and the numerous individual \\"Iron Hand missions\\" that generally accompanied strike packages of the USAF and USN. The \\"Iron Hand\\" is a metaphor to the steady hand and nerves of steel it took for pilots to fly directly at the radar-emitting anti-aircraft missile sites while the radar-seeking missiles flew down to destroy the target. The tactics employed on the Iron Hand missions were primarily designed to diminish the threat of SA-2 missiles to a bombing strike force. History The People's Army of Vietnam, with the aid of the Soviet Union and China, took defense measures as a response to the American-led Operation Rolling Thunder. On April 5, 1965 an RF-8A aircraft from brought back photography of the first positively identified SAM. Soviet installations had a distinctive six-pointed star arrangement that made them easy to identify, and the installations in Vietnam were being built in the same arrangement. Over the next several months more SAM sites were discovered, but permission to mount strikes on these sites was refused. Not until several American planes had been shot down–-the first Navy losses were VA-23 A-4 aircraft from in August—was official sanction was given for anti-SAM missions. Operations Operation Iron Hand began on August 12, 1965, but the first actual strike against a SAM site was not accomplished until the morning of October 17. Four A-4E aircraft from , with an A-6 Intruder pathfinder, found a site near Kép Air Base, northeast of Hanoi, and destroyed it. For the Navy, the A-4 Skyhawk and A-3 Skywarrior played pivotal roles during Iron Hand anti-SAM missions; the two aircraft were armed with \\"beam-riding\\" AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missiles, which could be launched against SAM sites. A typical Iron Hand mission involved an F-8 fighter escorting a slower A-4 ahead of the main Alpha strike force of 20 aircraft and would attempt to eliminate enemy SAM sites; first the A-4 would launch the anti-radar Shrike missile at the SAM site and then the F-8 would strafe the site with 20-millimeter cannon fire. Cluster bombs and rocket fire were both very effective tools against dispersed SAM sites. A more common application of a Navy Iron Hand mission involved an A-4 Skyhawk or A-6 Intruder, armed with Shrikes, which would fly low-level (\\"above deck\\"), detectable by SAM search radar while still having ready access to much lower, radar-free altitudes (\\"hard deck\\"). The pilot's avionics would detect a SAM radar's acquisition (\\"lock\\") onto his aircraft; the pilot would then dive for the hard deck, choose another approach track, suddenly pitch 15 degrees up without re-entering the SAM radar field (\\"cone\\") and launch the Shrike into the cone. The Shrike would then acquire the SAM radar's location, fly to it and destroy it, thus disabling SAM missiles associated with the particular radar, allowing American aircraft to conduct their missions unharassed. An Air Force Iron Hand mission was similar. A group of four fighter/bombers flew in ahead of the strike package to suppress SAMs. One or more would be two-seat F-100F or F-105F Wild Weasels with SAM detection and analysis electronics. Initially, the fighter/bombers had to attack SAM sites with gravity bombs. When F-105F Wild Weasels arrived, they brought the Shrike anti-radiation missile (ARM) for limited stand-off capability. Later, F-105G Wild Weasels could also be armed with the Standard ARM. Later years North Vietnamese forces eventually attempted to defeat Iron Hand missions by using SAM radars intermittently or by shutting off the radar entirely if they felt threatened; this worked with the initial iron bomb attacks and with the initial Shrike anti-radiation missile, which could not 'remember' the location of the enemy radar source if the radar was turned off. Later Iron Hand aircraft carried the large, expensive AGM-78 Standard ARM, which was capable of locking in the location of the source even if the radar was turned off. The Standard Arm (AGM-78) as a deterrent for suppression of North Vietnam's AA defenses was noticeably effective. During the course of six months (in 1970) the A-6B(PAT) aircraft, loaded with the AGM-78 \\"Standard Arm\\" anti-radiation missiles, were employed as escorts for various reconnaissance and strike missions. The Iron Hand escorts broadcast their presence and intentions to communications intercept facilities. No ARM missiles were launched on any active AA radars.

It is located 23 kilometers southeast of Bayreuth and 5 kilometers south of Kemnath. The town of Neustadt am Kulm is situated at the base of the western side of the mountain. The mountain is 682 meters (2,238 ft) tall and has a 25 meter (82 ft) tall observation tower at its peak. The observation tower offers views of the northern Franconian Switzerland, the southern wall of the Fichtelgebirge mountain range, and the Upper Palatinate Forest. Since 1949, the mountain has been protected as a federal monument in the Northern Upper Palatinate Forest Natural Park. There are several well marked hiking paths up the mountain and around the surrounding forests. The mountain is one of the most imposing basalt mountains of Bavaria. According to the Bavarian State Geology Office, during the Tertiary, now also called Paleocene-Pliocene period, a number of active volcanoes produced liquid magma in Northern Bavaria, mostly due to the continental collision of Europe and Africa. As a result, not only the Alps but a number of fissure vents and cracks began to form throughout central Europe where magma could rise. Most of the Rauher Kulm's magma cooled below the surface. During the Middle Ages a castle was built on top of the Rauher Kulm. During the Second Margrave War the castle was destroyed after a prolonged siege.2004 Archaeology Findings ReferencesExternal links * Photos of the Rauher Kulm (German) * Vulkanlandschaft Rauher Kulm auf Naturpark nördlicher Oberpfälzer Wald (German) * Archäologische Ausgrabungen am Rauhen Kulm 2004 (Landschaftsmuseum Obermain)(German) * Ausführliche geologische Beschreibung (German) Category:Upper Palatinate Category:Mountains of Bavaria ","title":"Rauher Kulm"},{"id":"22776291","text":"Millipede burns are a cutaneous condition caused by some millipedes that secrete a toxic liquid that causes a brownish pigmentation or burn when it comes into contact with the skin.

The first generation model was internally designated as the N12 series and was marketed in Japan at Nissan Cherry Store locations as the Pulsar EXA. The second generation EXA was designated as the N13 series. Both generations were marketed in North America under the name Nissan Pulsar NX.  Nissan Pulsar EXA (N12; 1982–1986)  The Pulsar EXA was known in North America as the Pulsar NX and shared many of its parts with the Nissan Sentra. It was available from 1982 to 1986 and came with several of the engines also seen in the regular Pulsars. In North America. where it arrived for model year 1983, it received either the fuel injected turbocharged E15ET engine or the carburetted naturally aspirated E16S engine. The Pulsar EXA followed a successful strategy Nissan used in Japan of offering the economical Nissan Sunny in an affordable, youth-oriented two-door coupé, demonstrated by the Nissan Sunny fastback coupé, which was offered since the Sunny's introduction in 1966. As the Pulsar was a companion to the Nissan Sunny, but offered at a different Japanese Nissan dealership called Nissan Cherry Store, the Pulsar EXA followed in the tradition of the Sunny Coupé. The car's peculiar upright styling is partially due to the decision to use the regular Pulsar's rather tall windshield and cowl. As a result, the dashboard wa largely identical to that of a Pulsar hatchback or sedan. The Pulsar EXA was first introduced in April 1982 with two versions of the E15 engine, either carburetted or fuel injected. In May 1983 the turbocharged E15ET engine was introduced, producing at 5600 rpm. The same spec was used on cars exported to Singapore, where the top speed was listed as with a 0-100 km/h acceleration time of 8.8 seconds. At this time, a door mirror became standard on the EXA rather than the traditional fender-mounted unit. Fender-mounted mirrors had been required by law until March 1983 and the Pulsar EXA was the first Japanese car to be equipped with door-mounted mirrors in the domestic market. In Japan, the Pulsar EXA convertible was a limited edition model was designed to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Nissan Cherry Japanese dealership chain, and sold as a companion to the Nissan Pulsar. It appeared in Japan the same year as the Honda CR-X in the same marketing segment, replacing the Nissan Pulsar N10 series coupe. It was launched in May 1985, and just 100 vehicles were made available for the whole of Japan. The vehicle sports numerous special accessories, including a soft top made from a special insulating material to keep out the rain and heat, and a rear window made from organic glass to ensure high visibility. In September 1983, Nissan Australia released the two- door Pulsar EXA coupé with the 1.5-liter turbocharged engine. This model develops at 6500 rpm.

It featured a \\"T-bar removable hatch roof\\" Nissan EXA (sales brochure), Nissan Motor Company (Australia) Pty. Ltd., April 1990 and could accommodate either of two distinct removable rear hatch designs, a coupé-style hatch door or a station wagon / shooting brake style canopy, marketed as the Sportbak. The EXA / Pulsar NX could also be driven without either rear hatch. The design was conceived largely at the Nissan Design International (now Nissan Design America) studios in San Diego, CA and shared styling cues (prominently, the rear side window angle) with the contemporary two-door Nissan Pathfinder/Terrano (WD21) SUV. The design was done under the direction of NDI President Jerry Hirshberg, Blue Studio Chief Designer Allan Flowers and Doug Wilson. The EXA / Pulsar NX featured the CA16DE engine. NIssan EXA N13 with Sportbak canopy open Nissan EXA N13 with Sportbak rear canopy In Australia, the Series 1 EXA (1986–1987) came with the CA16DE, vinyl rear seats, front vented disk with rear drum brakes, and power steering. The Series 2 EXA (1988–1989) featured the CA18DE and cloth rear seats. There were also two GP versions of the S2 EXA made. 45 white GP edition vehicles were specially made for the celebrity race at the Adelaide Grand Prix in 1988. They had all the features of the Series 2, but also had Pulsar SSS wheels, build numbers on a badge in the dash and a factory roll cage which was removed after the race. The 1989 GP featured all the same features of the Series 2 EXA. They also had the Pulsar SSS wheels, a more aggressive front bumper, and build numbers on a badge in the dash.

It has been referred to as \\"the National Mall of Norway\\". HistoryEarly history= It was originally a marshy place, but became a park around the same time as buildings were raised in the street Karl Johans gate, and the street Stortingsgata was built in the south, cutting across the marsh. It was preserved as a park because house owners in Karl Johans gate did not want tall buildings on the other side of the street. In 1864, around the time the Parliament of Norway Building was under construction, the park was given its current name, inspired by Eidsvoll where the Constitution of Norway was drafted and signed by the Norwegian Constituent Assembly. =Event of 1881= Unveiling ceremony in 1881 A statue of Henrik Wergeland, sculpted by Brynjulf Bergslien, was raised here in 1881. It was unveiled on 17 May 1881, Norwegian Constitution Day, in a highly politicized atmosphere with a speech by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. For many years Wergeland had been portrayed as a wordsmith first and foremost, especially by his first biographer (1866) Hartvig Lassen, but on the other hand, liberals such as Olaf Skavlan and Erik Vullum saw Wergeland as a political character, a forerunner within their own ideology.Aarnes, 1990: p. 149 Political conservatives staunchly opposed that Bjørnson be holding the speech, and submitted other candidates, but were subdued.Aarnes, 1990: pp. 151–152 They had already provoked the liberals in 1880, when a statue of Christian IV of Denmark was unveiled at Stortorvet. The speech was thus held by Bjørnson, and attended by 50,000 people. This crowd included at least 2,000 countryfolk, from Østerdal and elsewhere, and became a contribution to the liberals' nation-building project.Sørensen, 1984: p. 23 Other statues, including one of Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, are found in the vicinity.

Palaeographically it has been assigned to the 15th century. The text represents the Byzantine textual tradition. The manuscript was prepared for liturgical use.  Description  The codex contains almost complete text of the four Gospels on 228 parchment leaves () with some lacunae (Matthew 1:1-17; 26:47-27:40; Mark 1:1-9; Luke 1:1-18; John 1:1-21). All lacunae were made by a man who mischievously cut out the ornamented headpieces at the beginning of each Gospel. In modern time two unfoliated parchment leaves, and two paper fly-leaves were added at the beginning and end. The text is written in one column per page, in 25 lines per page. The letters are clearly but unskilfully written. The manuscript is decorated, with geometric, occasionally with zoomorphic decorations, in brown and red.

It contains tables of the (tables of contents) before each Gospel, lectionary markings at the margin (for liturgical use), Synaxarion, Menologion, and subscriptions at the end of each Gospel.  Text  The Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type. Aland placed it in Category V. According to the Claremont Profile Method it represents textual family Kx in Luke 1 (fragmentary), Luke 10, and Luke 20. It belongs also to the textual cluster 1213 (minuscule 1213 is the lead manuscript of this cluster).  History  The original manuscript contained dated colophon, but it was erased by a later hand. The manuscript is dated by the INTF to the 15th century. The manuscript probably was rewritten from minuscule 65. The manuscript was brought by John Covel, British chaplain, from Constantinople to England (along with minuscule 110 and other manuscripts). It was designated as Covel's 5. Then – in 1715 or 1716 – the manuscript was sold to Robert Harley, and to his son Edward Harley.Michaelis, Introduction to the New Testament (London 1823), p. 735. In 1753 it was purchased along with other manuscripts of collection by the British Museum. The manuscript was added to the list of New Testament manuscripts by Scholz (1794-1852). It was examined by Covell, Scholz (only Mark 5), Bloomfield, and C. R. Gregory in 1883. The manuscript was rebound in 1964. It is currently housed at the British Library (Harley MS 5777).

Signs and symptoms Body lice are a nuisance in themselves and cause intense itching. They are also vectors (transmitters) of other diseases and can spread epidemic typhus, trench fever, and louse-borne relapsing fever. Risk factors Body lice are spread through prolonged direct physical contact with a person who has them or through contact with articles such as clothing, beds, bed linens, or towels that have been in contact with an infested person. In the United States, body lice infestations are rare, typically found mainly in homeless transient populations who do not have access to bathing and regular changes of clean clothes. Infestation is unlikely to persist on anyone who bathes regularly and who has at least weekly access to freshly laundered clothing and bedding. Although louse-borne (epidemic) typhus is no longer widespread, outbreaks of this disease still occur during times of war, civil unrest, natural or man-made disasters, and in prisons where people live together in unsanitary conditions. Louse-borne typhus still exists in places where climate, chronic poverty, and social customs or war and social upheaval prevent regular changes and laundering of clothing. Pathophysiology Body lice frequently lay their eggs on or near the seams of clothing. They must feed on blood and usually only move to the skin to feed. They exist worldwide and infest people of all races and can therefore spread rapidly under crowded living conditions where hygiene is poor (homeless, refugees, victims of war or natural disasters). Treatment A body lice infestation is treated by improving the personal hygiene of the infested person, including assuring a regular (at least weekly) change of clean clothes. Clothing, bedding, and towels used by the infested person should be laundered using hot water (at least ) and machine dried using the hot cycle. Sometimes the infested person also is treated with a pediculicide (a medicine that can kill lice); however, a pediculicide generally is not necessary if hygiene is maintained and items are laundered appropriately at least once a week. A pediculicide should be applied exactly as directed on the bottle or by a physician. Delousing can also be practically achieved by boiling all clothes and bedding, or washing them at a high temperature. A temperature of for 5 minutes will kill most of the adults and prevent eggs from hatching.Page on website of CIGNA Leaving the clothes unwashed, but unworn for a full week, also results in the death of lice and eggs. Where this is not practical or possible, powder dusting with 10% DDT, 1% malathion or 1% permethrin is also effective. Oral ivermectin at a dose of 12 mg on days 0, 7 and 14 has been used in a small trial of 33 people in Marseilles, but did not result in complete eradication, although there was a significant fall in the number of parasites and proportion of people infected. At the moment, ivermectin cannot be routinely recommended for the treatment of body lice. Medication, insecticide or burning of clothing and bedding is usually not necessary, as the problem normally goes away with daily bathing, weekly (or more frequent) laundering and drying of clothing, bedding, towels, etc. in a hot clothes drier.

The film was released in the UK on May 14, 2009 by Peccadillo Pictures The film was co-produced in Israel, France and Germany.  Plot  Aaron (Zohar Strauss), a married Orthodox Jewish father of four living in Jerusalem, takes over his family's butcher shop after the recent death of his father. Ezri (Ran Danker), a nineteen-year- old homeless Yeshiva student, visits the shop to use the telephone. After turning down Ezri's offer to help around the shop, he later finds Ezri asleep in the local synagogue and offers him space to stay at the shop. Aaron takes Ezri on as an apprentice and encourages his religious studies and his talent for drawing. The two men become close after Ezri invites Aaron to take a ritual bath in the outskirts of the city. Rivka, Aaron's devoted wife, initially welcomes her husband's apprentice into their family circle. One evening after Aaron asks Ezri to draw his portrait, Ezri makes a sexual advance, which Aaron rebuffs. Later, however they kiss and begin a sexual relationship. Rivka becomes suspicious when her husband begins to arrive late at home. Rabbi Vaisben, a family friend, warns Aaron against associating too closely with Ezri, reporting that he was expelled from his local yeshiva, but Aaron defends him. Rivka, increasingly concerned, sees them leaving the shop together late at night. Being a devout religious man, living in Mea Shearim, a Haredi community, Aaron is torn between his family and devotion to God, and the intense feelings he has for Ezri .Internet Movie Database Aaron is repeatedly told that Ezri is a bad influence and perhaps even cursed; local people start warning Ezri to stay away from them. Flyers begin to circulate in the neighborhood, prompting many to boycott the butcher's shop. Under increasing social, commercial and family pressure, Aaron tries to break off ties with Ezri but is unable to bring himself to do so. Confronted by Rabbi Vaisben, Aaron is unabashed, feeling alive only now. Ezri encounters his former lover on the streets of their neighborhood, which escalates into Ezri being attacked by some locals. Aaron witnesses the attack but does not intervene. He consoles Ezri afterwards, but they both realize it is time for Ezri to leave the community. Aaron continues to be distressed by this, asking for Rivka's understanding and protection. He returns early one morning to the spot where he took a bath with Ezri. He submerges himself beneath the water for a prolonged period before the camera fades to black.

In 1984, Dan Galorath began consulting for Computer Economics, Inc. It was in that consulting role where Galorath became familiar with Dr. Randall Jensen's modifications to the Putnam model. While Jensen's work was a marked improvement on the original Putnam model, the work was not usable in a commercial environment. For CEI, Dan Galorath worked to design a more user-friendly software estimation program, which was known as CEI System-3.\\"Why SEER Got Started.\\" Accessed 7 May 2009. By 1988, Dan's company Galorath Inc had formed the SEER Technology Division and Galorath was working as one of the lead architects on the foundation of what would come to be known as SEER-SEM. SEER-SEM took the usability which was similar to the work Dan had done for CEI System-3 and added historical case studies and a graphic user interface. These advances made SEER-SEM an application which could be used by project managers to better estimate the needs for their software applications. Since its inception, Galorath and his company have made numerous improvements to the original SEER-SEM, adding a library of thousands of projects which have helped contribute to the product being used by companies ranging from aircraft manufacturers Lockheed Martin and Northrup Grumman, to electronics manufacturer Siemens, and even the United States Department of Defense. In 2006, Dan Galorath and Michael W Evans collaborated on a book about software estimation.

The underlying model was based in part on the work of Dr. Randall Jenson's public domain modified Putnam model. Some of the characters shared between the two models include uncertainty the ability to estimate minimal time. CEI's System-3 greatly enhanced the usability of the Jensen's model, making it a realistic entrant into the software estimation market. =SEER-SEM= The initial version of SEER-SEM was 22,000 lines of source code and only operated on Windows 2.0.

Having lain outside the city limits for most of its history, the picturesque bridge is noted for its medieval bridge tower, which served to protect this important northern approach to Rome.  History  Ponte Nomentano by Giuseppe Vasi, c. 1752. In antiquity, the Ponte Nomentano was located outside of the Aurelian Wall, at a distance of 3.9 km from the Porta Nomentana. The East Roman historian Procopius records that the bridge was destroyed by the Ostrogoths under their king Totila around 547 AD during the Gothic War, but rebuilt by the victorious Roman general Narses in 552.Procopius: De Bello Gothico, 3.24 The still intact late Republican fabric of the main arch, however, indicates that the bridge could have been only partially damaged in the event. The lower part of the bridge tower dates, according to an unproven tradition, from the time of Pope Adrian I (772–795), while the imposing castle-like structure was constructed during a general overhaul of the bridge by Pope Nicholas V (1447–1455), after which minor repairs followed in 1461, 1470, and 1474. The bridge was painted by artist Joseph Wright of Derby in 1773. The painting was later badly overpainted and it languished in Derby Museum until it was restored after it was rediscovered in 2017. In 1849, French troops cut the bridge by 7 m to check Garibaldi's advance on Rome, but it was soon restored. Today, the bridge is surrounded by a park, well within the municipal limits of Rome, and restricted to pedestrians.  Structure  The 31.30-meter-long superstructure of the Ponte Nomentano has, in essence, preserved its medieval character, while the dimensions of the bridge, which measure 60 m in overall length and 7.35 m in width, have remained practically unchanged since antiquity. The 15-meter-wide central arch clearly dates back to ancient times, it is presumed from the late Republic or early Augustan Principate, as indicated by its semi-circular shape and the execution of the travertine stonework. Apart from this, only some further layers of travertine in the retaining walls can be assigned with certainty to the Roman period. The two lateral brick arches were built in the reign of Pope Innocent X (1644–1655) in lieu of stone vaults. Further examples for fortified bridges across the Aniene include the Roman Ponte Salario and Ponte Mammolo and the medieval Ponte di San Francesco in Subiaco.

The Burgundian inheritance in the Low Countries consisted of numerous fiefs held by the Dukes of Burgundy in modern-day Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg. The Duke of Burgundy was a member of the House of Valois-Burgundy and, after 1482, of the House of Habsburg. Given that the Dukes of Burgundy lost Burgundy proper to the Kingdom of France in 1477, and were never able to recover it, they moved their court to the Low Countries. The Burgundian Low Countries were ultimately expanded to include Seventeen Provinces under Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. The Burgundian inheritance then passed to Philip II of Spain, whose rule was contested by the Dutch revolt, and fragmented into the Spanish Netherlands and the Dutch republic. Background Around the 13th and early 14th century, various Dutch cities became so important that they started playing a major role in the political and economical affairs of their respective fiefs.\\"Low Countries, 1000–1400 A.D.\\", in Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000 At the same time, the political system of relatively petty lords was ending, and stronger rulers (with actual power over larger territories) started to emerge. In the case of the Dutch, these two developments resulted in the political unification of all Dutch fiefs within a supra-regional state. This process started in the 14th century, with the Flemish cities gaining previously unseen powers over their county. When Louis II, Count of Flanders, died without a male heir, these cities (Bruges, Ypres, and Ghent) arranged a marriage between his daughter and the Duke of Burgundy. By doing this, they set in motion a chain of events eventually leading to the establishment and expansion of the Burgundian Low Countries. Timeline of expansionUnder Valois-Burgundy= *In 1384, Philip the Bold acquired the county of Flanders, Artois, and the Franche-Comté by the death of his father-in-law, Louis II of Flanders, whose daughter and heiress Margaret was Philip's wife. *In 1421, Philip the Good (the grandson of Philip the Bold) buys the County of Namur from John III, Marquis of Namur. *In 1430, Philip of Brabant died childless, leaving his cousin Philip the Good as his heir in Brabant, Lothier, and Limburg. *In 1432, the Hook and Cod wars ended in victory for the Hollandic cities, Philip the Good was offered to become count of Holland, Zeeland and Hainaut. *In 1443, Philip conquers the Duchy of Luxembourg *In 1456, Philip managed that his illegitimate son, David, was elected Bishop of Utrecht, leading to the First and Second Utrecht Civil War. *In 1456, he also had his nephew Louis of Bourbon become Prince-Bishop of Liège, leading to the Liège Wars. *In 1473, Philip's son, Charles the Bold buys the Duchy of Guelders from Duke Arnold. However, the house of Burgundy lost this title at Charles's death in 1477. *In 1477, Charles the Bold died fighting an alliance led by the King of France. France annexed the Duchy of Burgundy, but the title Duke of Burgundy remained in titular use, as seen with his only child, his daughter Mary of Burgundy (Mary the Rich). =Under Habsburg= *1478: Mary the Rich marries Maximilian I of Habsburg. *1482: Death of Mary the Rich. Maximilian assumes rule over what are now effectively the Habsburg Netherlands. Artois ceded to France by the Treaty of Arras. *1493: Treaty of Senlis. Artois and St. Pol back in Habsburg hands. Flanders becomes a fief of the Holy Roman Empire. *1506: Maximilian and Mary's grandson Charles of Ghent inherits his family's Burgundian lands and becomes Lord of the Netherlands. *1516/1519. Charles becomes King of Spain, Archduke of Austria and Holy Roman Emperor as Charles V. *1521: Charles V conquers Tournai and the Tournaisis, until then under French influence. *1524: Charles conquers Friesland, renamed Lordship of Frisia, during the Guelders Wars. *1528: Charles liberates the Bishopric of Utrecht and its lands in Overijssel, then annexes them as Lordship of Utrecht and Lordship of Overijssel, during the Guelders Wars. *1536: Charles conquers the Lordship of Groningen and County of Drenthe, during the Guelders Wars. *1543: Charles reclaims and conquers the Duchy of Guelders and the County of Zutphen (in personal union), during the Guelders Wars. *1549: Pragmatic Sanction creates the Seventeen Provinces. *1555/1556: Charles V transfers the Seventeen Provinces to Philip II of Spain. Establishment of the Spanish Netherlands. Politically, the Burgundian and Habsburg periods were of tremendous importance to the Dutch, as the various Dutch fiefs were now united politically into one single entity.Chapter 3, Forming Political Unity, paragraph 3; The Age of Habsburg (1477–1588). The period ended in great turmoil, as the rise of Protestantism, the centralist policies of the Habsburg Empire, and other factors resulted in the Dutch Revolt and the Eighty Years' War.

Avian mite species implicated include the red mite (Dermanyssus gallinae), tropical fowl mite (Ornithonyssus bursa) and northern fowl mite (Ornithonyssus sylviarum). Mite dermatitis is also associated with rodents infested with the tropical rat mite (Ornithonyssus bacoti), spiny rat mite (Laelaps echidnina) and house- mouse mite (Liponyssoides sanguineus), where the condition is known as rodent mite dermatitis. Urban gamasoidosis is associated with window-sills, ventilation and air-conditioning intakes, rooves and eaves, which serve as shelters for nesting birds. Humans bitten by these mites experience a non- specific dermatitis with intense itching.  Clinical signs  The most common symptoms are \\"itching and punctiform, erythematous papules\\" with a size of \\"1–3 mm\\" and a \\"central punctum\\", the itching and irritation are reactions to the saliva the mites secrete when feeding. Bites are normally located in groups around the neck and body areas covered by clothes (waist, trunk, upper extremities and abdomen), but can also be found on the legs, finger webs, axillae, the groin, and buttocks. If feeding occurs while a patient is sleeping, bedclothes and pillows may show red spots caused by droppings or crushed mites. D. gallinae is capable of infesting the ear canal, with symptoms including itching, internal inflammation and discharge. It can also infest the scalp, with severe itching — particularly at night as the primary symptom — as well as \\"the nares, orbits and eyelids, and genitourinary and rectal orifices.“ Additional symptoms include pinpricks, secondary infections, scarring, hyperpigmentation as well as psychological trauma resulting in anxiety and depression.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis can be challenging as the small size of avian mites make them \\"barely visible to the unaided eye\\". Identification of the species is best carried out by a medical entomologist using a microscope, positive identification of species is critical for recommendation of suitable treatment. Samples can be obtained using corrugated cardboard traps, left in infested areas. Diagnoses of gamasoidosis have a long history, with \\"cases [...] reported since the 17th century, documented in the leading medical literature since at least the 1920s.\\" Avian and rodent mites have been documented infesting residential buildings, work spaces, schools and hospitals. Despite this, there is considered to be widespread ignorance and misinformation \\"regarding human infestation with D. gallinae across healthcare, science and pest control fields\\", which in turn has led to increasing numbers of infestations and a dangerous propagation of the disease. Due to it being an uncommon diagnosis, physicians are generally not aware of the condition, meaning gamasoidosis may be misdiagnosed as scabies or pediculosis or bites mistakenly identified as coming from bed bugs. Many cases of gamasoidosis go unreported, suggesting that the actual incidence is higher than generally believed. As a result, in cases of unexplained bites in residential areas, the involvement of D. gallinae should always be considered, especially during late spring and early summer when wild birds make their nests. Mite bite on the chest of a patient. The life cycle of the mite is another important method of diagnosis. Hematophagic mites generally feed at night but may also feed during the day if the room is sufficiently dark. Attacks in public and office buildings tend to occur during the daytime. O. bursa is an exception as it generally remains on its hosts and will feed during the day. D. gallinae may be commonly found in the bedroom or where the patient sleeps, as they prefer to stay close to their host for optimal feeding. They are attracted to warm hiding places that simulate the body temperature of birds (e.g. pigeons 42 °C), \\"such as the electrical devices running in stand-by mode (e.g. laptop computers, television, radio clocks etc.)\\" which generate heat. As a result, \\"it is strongly recommended to check these electrical appliances for the mite detection\\". D. gallinae generally visit their host for up to 1–2 hours, leave after completing their blood meal and typically feed every 2–4 days. They are able to move extremely quickly and can take less than 1 second to bite, enough time to inject their saliva and to induce rash and itching. They locate potential hosts through temperature changes, vibration and CO². It has been hypothesized the D. gallinae is capable of 'learning' \\"to associate non-host skin with a blood-meal if the host selection process permitted feeding.\\" Combined with a generalist approach to finding hosts and the capability of digesting non-avian blood could potentially explain their documented host expansion to mammals and humans. There is documented \\"co-occurrence of gamasoidosis and various immunosuppressive disorders\\" and physicians should bear in mind that immunocompromised patients, patients that take corticosteroids, and patients with dementia may have a more severe infestation than healthy patients, Despite this, while immunosuppression can \\"increase susceptibility, it is not necessarily a pre-requisite for infestation\\". Dermatoscopy can help to exclude the diagnosis of delusional parasitosis. Pets such as canaries, cats, dogs and gerbils can be infested also, diagnosis can be made by examining their feathers or fur for mites and is best carried out by a veterinary professional.  Treatment  Treatment of gamasoidosis can be difficult; avian mites have developed resistance to multiple pesticides and the different species concerned display varied ecologies that necessitate divergent treatment approaches. For a patient to achieve full recovery, the mites must be eradicated from the person's environment through the removal of nests and appropriate disinfestation of infested areas by a pest control professional. Total eradication can be difficult to achieve as D. gallinae can survive for longer than nine months without a blood meal and is capable of both digesting and completing its life cycle on human blood alone. Additionally, populations can expand rapidly, with a single female capable of laying up to \\"30 eggs in their lifetime\\"; prolonged darkness has been found to significantly promote mite population growth.Feral pigeon nests are common sources of avian mites and should be removed as part of the treatment process.Patients are advised to: * Shower frequently to remove mites from their skin and hair. *Washing clothes and bedding at temperatures, at or above 60 °C. *Remove the source of the mites, such as infested animal shelters, cages and nests. *Perform regular intensive vacuum cleaning and steam cleaning — the vacuum bag should be placed in a sealed bag and thrown away outside in a contained bin. *Disinfect infested household items and areas with effective acaricides such as pyrethroids. *Washing of textiles or steam cleaning (cushions, carpets, curtains) at or above 60 °C, and drying them using an automated laundry drier. * Dust infested areas with amorphous silica gels such as CimeXa. * Heat treat their residence — raising the temperature of their living space above 55 °C for a sustained period. * Reduce the relative humidity of their home below 55%. Fluralaner, an effective acaricide, available commercially as Bravecto may be administered to cats and dogs after consulting a vet. Antihistamines and topical corticosteroids can be used for temporary relief of symptoms. Certain essential oils are known to have an acaricide effect on avian mites. Cardboard traps impregnated with neem extracts or other acaricides can be used to reduce avian mite populations. In the case of scalp infestation, treatments with 1% permethrin shampoo can be used to remove the mites. For ear canal infestation, aural toilet is recommended with a course of 1% permethrin to be used as ear drops and for infected wax to be removed by a professional. Ineffective and often prolonged attempts to eradicate infestations commonly result in economic issues, due to a significant financial outlay when patients relocate or attempt to control these infestations.  Epidemiology  D. gallinae poses a significant threat to public health as the mite may be vector/reservoir of several zoonotic pathogens, such as Chlamydia psittaci, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Salmonella spp., Lyme disease, Mycobacterium spp., Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella spp., Borrelia burgdorferi, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, and Fowlpox virus.

Genesis and performance The movie (directed by Tod Browning and starring Bela Lugosi) could be shown to audiences both as a silent movie and as a talkie, though conversation was limited to basic narrative elements. Unusually, it did not have a specific score and only two pieces of music on its soundtrack: Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake during the opening credits, and the overture of Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg during a scene at an opera. Glass was commissioned to write the score by Universal Studios Home Entertainment, which released the movie with the Glass-soundtrack on VHS and DVD in 1999. According to Glass, the choice of chamber music played by a string quartet rather than an orchestral score followed from the movie's setting, \\"libraries and drawing rooms and gardens.\\" Kronos and Glass (on piano) performed the score during viewings of the movie across the United States in 1999 and 2000 to promote the album. Other promotion efforts by Universal, which was trying to \\"reinvigorate and re- market\\" their Classical Monsters catalog, included discounts for buyers of multiple CDs, and a trailer for the movie on copies of the video release of The Mummy. Philip Glass and the Kronos Quartet Glass and the Quartet have collaborated on a number of albums. Kronos first recorded a Glass composition on the 1985 soundtrack Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters. In 1986, they contributed two tracks to his Songs from Liquid Days. In that same year they recorded a composition of his for their 1986 album Kronos Quartet, their first album on Nonesuch Records, which also releases Glass's music. In 1993, they recorded Kronos Quartet Performs Philip Glass, containing his String Quartets nos. 2, 4, and 5; the latter is the first piece Glass wrote specifically for Kronos. A number of compositions played by Kronos are found on the Philip Glass 10-CD collection Glass Box: A Nonesuch Retrospective, released in 2008. Critical reception The soundtrack and the performances thereof have received mixed reviews. Entertainment Weekly was very positive, praising the \\"hypnotic new score,\\" while The Essential Monster Movie Guide calls the score \\"unnecessary,\\" and a Lugosi-biography calls it \\"ill-considered.\\" Negative reviews abounded: Allan Kozinn of The New York Times remarked that \\"the project seems not to have inspired Mr. Glass....Heard alone on CD it is harmless enough, but coupled with the film it does more harm than good.\\" The San Francisco Chronicle said, in anticipation of a performance with the composer on piano, \\"after previewing CD and video, it is painfully evident that this composer and this film are mismatched.\\" It continued, \\"Glass' constant score simply sounds busy, its gloomy arpeggios merely getting in the way. The few chords that accompany moments of shock verge on the cheesy....the Glass music seems to suck away the film's life blood. Who's the vampire now?\\" Likewise negative, but this time after a live performance of the movie and music at Royce Hall, on the UCLA campus, was Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times: \\"As a public event, however, the Royce concert, performed by Glass and the Kronos Quartet and conducted by Michael Riesman, was a distinct disappointment.\\" Others were more positive. Roger Ebert praised the score, writing: \\"The Glass score is effective in the way it suggests not just moody creepiness, but the urgency and need behind Dracula's vampirism. It evokes a blood-thirst that is 500 years old.\\"Dracula (1931) review by Roger Ebert, September 19, 1999 Self-proclaimed \\"film purists\\" Bill Hunt and Todd Doogan called the soundtrack \\"quite cool\\" and commented that it \\"fits the film perfectly.\\" After commenting on what he called the low artistic quality of the film, Philip Kennicott of The Washington Post said: \\"The delightful thing about Glass's music for film is that there's no need for it. It is a pure artistic addition to something that was not wanting in the first place; and in that act, Glass confirms a kind of reverence for the original. It is, artistically if not financially, an act of selfless collaboration with a partner — the film — that might be considered the culturally undead.\\" Bradley Bambarger, in Billboard, praised the soundtrack as \\"one of Glass' most lyrical, moving works, regardless of genre.\\" Mark Allender's review on Allmusic likewise ranks the soundtrack very high in Glass's oeuvre: Track listingReleases and format Alternate cover. The album was released by Nonesuch with two different covers. One was black with the name \\"DRACULA\\" in a panel with an ornamented border; the version currently available has a colored drawing of Count Dracula resembling the movie poster. Unlike most other Kronos releases on Nonesuch, this album does not come as an MP3 download. This album is currently available on iTunes for the price of $9.99. The soundtrack was included in a 5-CD compilation of Philip Glass soundtracks, released in 2001 (Nonesuch 79660).

Two drinks were singled out by The New York Times: Jim Meehan of PDT made a drink which consisted of bacon- infused Bushmills combined with maple syrup, orange and lemon juice, and a whole egg; Eben Freeman of Tailor employed bacon-infused Bushmills, served with roasted tomato gelée squares, a poached quail egg yolk, Irish breakfast- tea foam, and crispy black-pudding bits. Inspiration for Bacon Salt In October 2007 Justin Esch (the co-founder of J&D;'s Down Home Enterprises) and his older brother Christopher Esch were talking about their fondness of Mitch Morgan shots with friends at the Jewish wedding of a childhood friend in New York, some of whom maintained a Kosher diet, which prohibits the consumption of pork products. The Esch brothers discussed the universal appeal of bacon and determined the world needed a bacon-flavored seasoning salt that could capture the deliciousness of bacon without the dietary issues, resulting in the development of Bacon Salt.

Ricks about the Iraq War. It covers the 2006–2008 period where his last book Fiasco left off. A primary focus is the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, along with the ascension to command of Gen. David Petraeus and the change in approach of Gen. Ray Odierno towards the use of counter-insurgency strategies. Ricks believes that the troop surge was successful in reducing violence in Iraq and \\"reviv[ing] American prospects in the war,\\" but that it was a failure based on its initial goal of bringing about a political reconciliation in Iraq. Ricks states in the first chapter of the book (page 8): > In revisiting the U.S. approach to the Iraq war, Petraeus found tactical > success--that is, improved security--but not the clear political > breakthrough that would have meant unambiguous strategic success. At the end > of the surge, the fundamental political problems facing Iraq were the same > ones as when it began. At the end of 2008, two years into the revamped war, > there was no prospect of the fighting ending anytime soon. But it was almost > certain that whenever it did end, it wouldn't be with the victory that the > Bush administration continued to describe, of an Iraq that was both a stable > democracy and an ally of the United States. Nor was that really the goal > anymore, though no one had said so publicly. Under Petraeus, the American > goal of transforming Iraq had quietly been scaled down. But even his less > ambitious target of sustainable security would remain elusive, with no > certainty of reaching it anytime soon. Ricks also predicted that the US will have combat troops in Iraq until at least 2015,Thomas Ricks at Authors@Google, March 11, 2009.. The last combat troops left with the war's end in December 2011, only to return three years later during the American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present). Ricks appeared to promote the book on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on 10 February, 2009.

Its formation on 10 May 1999 heralded the return of South African representation at the ISCM after many decades.Blake 2007.Heuvelmans 2000.  Nature and Purpose  NewMusicSA is a non-profit organisation which supports the creation and performance of New Music by South African composers of all stylistic and cultural backgrounds. The organisation holds annual new music festivals, commissions works, puts out calls for scores and runs the South African New Music Ensemble. It publishes the NewMusicSA Bulletin, an annual periodical offering articles on current New Music events, issues, composers and performers, together with scores of recent works by South African composers. It provides information services for current events in the form of its monthly newsletter, and aims to foster collaboration and a sense of community among its members and the wider New Music community.  Annual Festival  Since 2000, the organisation has held an annual festival, the New Music Indaba, which showcases contemporary South African music performed by musicians based both within the country and abroad. A central part of the festival are the 'Growing Composers' workshops, which provide the opportunity for emerging composers to work with established musicians and composers in a supportive environment. From 2000 to 2006, the New Music Indaba was held as part of the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape province. From 2007 to 2009 the festival was hosted by the University of South Africa (UNISA) in Pretoria/Tshwane, Gauteng. NewMusicSA also runs the Unyazi Electronic Music Festival, which alternates with the New Music Indaba on an annual basis. Since 2010 the two festivals have been hosted variously in Johannesburg and Durban. The 2014 Unyazi Electronic Music Festival was held in Johannesburg, hosted by the University of the Witwatersrand School of Arts. Other notable projects include The Bow Project, which commissioned numerous composers to write new pieces for string quartet based on the uhadi bow music of Nofinishi Dywili.  Exchange Programmes and Collaborations  NewMusicSA has provided an important link between South African art music composers and the international contemporary art music community by means of an exchange programme with the Visby International Centre for Composers (VICC). This programme has provided residencies for numerous South African composers in Gotland, Sweden. The most recent call for applicants took place in 2014, the residencies being awarded to Samora Ntsebeza and Pierre-Henri Wicomb. Since its foundation, NewMusicSA has worked with a number of other South African music and cultural organisations, such as the Southern African Music Rights Organisation (SAMRO), the Unisa Music Foundation and most recently the South African National Youth Orchestra to provide opportunities for emerging South African composers. In 2008 the archive of NewMusicSA, which includes much documentary information and numerous unique music scores by South African composers was donated to the Documentation Centre for Music at the University of Stellenbosch in the Western Cape province.  ISCM World Music Days Festival  An important aspect of the organisation's role is to convene an annual jury to select South African works that will be considered for performance at the ISCM's World Music Days festival. South African composers whose works have been selected for performance at the World Music Days Festival by the ISCM's international jury in recent years include, Robert Fokkens (2009), Clare Loveday (2008) and Stefans Grové (2007). In the past the music of Bongani Ndodana-Breen, Kevin Volans, Hans Huyssen, Mokale Koapeng, Hendrik Hofmeyr, Jürgen Bräuninger has also been heard at the festival. The 2015 festival will see the performance of another South African work.  South African New Music Ensemble  In 2013 NewMusicSA founded the South African New Music Ensemble (SANME), a chamber ensemble of variable instrumentation formulated with the purpose of bringing together performers and composers of new music in South Africa. The ensemble played its debut performance at the 2013 New Music Indaba at the University of KwaZulu-Natal Howard College Campus. In the same year NewMusicSA issued its first commissions in a call for scores for two works to be played by the ensemble. The call was for one entirely instrumental/acoustic work and one mixed electronic/acoustic work. The acoustic commission was awarded to Pierre-Henri Wicomb. The electronic/acoustic commission was awarded to Maxim Starcke.  Board and Past presidents  The board members as of 2014 are: Mr Chris Jeffery – Chair Mr Douglas Scott – Treasurer Mr William Fourie – Secretary & Vice-Chair Dr Chris van Rhyn – Bulletin co-Editor Mr Lukas Ligeti – Bulletin co-Editor Mr Malcolm Dedman – Communications & Membership officer Dr Cameron Harris – Board member Ms Fiona Tozer – Board member Past presidents of NewMusicSA include Michael Blake (who founded the organisation), Mokale Koapeng, Christopher Walton, Cameron Harris and Angie Mullins.

Beaubois spent a training period in Quebec and began his spreading of religious doctrine among the Illinois Indians in 1721. On 2 Feb. 1723, at Kaskaskia, Illinois he took the vows of a Jesuit. Because of the expansion of the Mississippi valley missions, the Jesuits had made the area a distinct mission district within the diocese of Quebec and Beaubois became the superior. He immediately went to France to populate and strengthen the new jurisdiction. The Compagnie des Indes was responsible for funding the parishes and missions in the Missio Ludovisiana district and he was successful in negotiating appropriate funding for future operations. He obtained authorization for the Jesuits to open a house in New Orleans and to have a plantation near the city for supplementing their operation. Beaubois also arranged to have Ursuline nuns funded to establish a girls’ school in New Orleans. This became the first girls' school in the Mississippi valley.

She is also the former senior vice president and chief digital officer for NBC News, including oversight of NBCNews.com.http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/487235-NBC_News_Takes_Back_MSNBC_com_From_Microsoft.php Early life and career Schiller is the daughter of Ronald Schiller, a former editor at Reader's Digest, and Lillian Schiller of Larchmont, New York. She graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelor's degree in Russian studies and Soviet studies, and a Master's degree in Russian from Middlebury College. After finishing her degrees, Schiller worked as tour guide and simultaneous Russian interpreter in the former Soviet Union. Turner Broadcasting/CNN In 1988 she joined Turner Broadcasting as a production assistant. During her early years with the company, Schiller worked on documentaries, children's series and network specials for TBS Superstation and TNT including programs such as National Geographic Explorer, David Attenborough's Private life of Plants, Captain Planet the Planters, Tom & Jerry's Kids, The Golden Globe Awards, and specials and series from the BBC, the Audubon Society, and the National Wildlife Federation. In 1998, Schiller transferred to CNN, where she eventually became head of the documentary unit which produced special and series for CNN-US and CNN International. Programs during that time included the Cold War, Beneath the Veil, Hank Aaron: Chasing the Dream and more. Schiller's division won multiple awards under her supervision including Emmys, Peabody's, DuPont's and Overseas Press Club Awards. Discovery Times Channel In 2002, Schiller was hired by The New York Times and Discovery Communications to develop and run a new joint venture network that would late become the Discovery Times Channel (the current-day Investigation Discovery). The network commissioned and programmed hundreds of hours of critically acclaimed current affairs and history series and specials including the 10-part series \\"Off To War” which followed a unit of National Guardsmen from Arkansas during their deployment to Iraq. New York Times In 2006, after The New York Times and Discovery Communications joint venture severed, Schiller joined the New York Times full-time to oversee original web video and then served as general manager of NYTimes.com, then the largest newspaper site in the world. While at The New York Times, Schiller was instrumental in integrating the newspaper and web newsrooms, including embedding web developers with journalists. Under Schiller's watch, the New York Times launched its first mobile presence, Facebook pages and Twitter accounts and grew audiences by double digits. NPR In late 2008 Schiller was named president and CEO of NPR. During her tenure, Schiller was widely credited with dramatically upgrading the network's digital presence, significantly expanding its revenue base, and attracting more listeners. She greenlit the network's first investigative unit and launched diversity initiatives that expanded the organizations output of multicultural programming for radio and online. Under her watch, NPR launched its mobile apps and expanded its digital output dramatically. =Juan Williams controversy= On October 20, 2010, NPR fired political analyst Juan Williams. Initial reports indicated Williams was fired for his comments on Fox News that he gets \\"nervous\\" when he sees people in \\"Muslim garb\\" boarding a plane. Speaking to the media, Schiller stated Williams was not fired for that particular incident, but for offering his controversial opinions on several occasions, which she deemed a breach of journalistic ethics for an NPR analyst. Schiller then intensified the existing controversy over Williams' dismissal when she added that Williams should have kept his Muslim comments between himself and \\"his psychiatrist or his publicist—take your pick.\\" Schiller quickly retracted her own remarks, stating, \\"I spoke hastily and I apologize to Juan and others for my thoughtless remark.\\" Juan Williams, appearing soon after on Fox News Channel \\"The O'Reilly Factor\\" noted in his own defense that other journalist staff members of NPR had previously voiced their own personal opinions and observations without being reprimanded or terminated. Williams speculated that his termination was occasioned by his frequent appearances on Fox News Channel programs in general, and not by any individual remarks he may have made. In January 2011, due to concerns with the \\"speed and handling of the termination process\\" of Juan Williams, the NPR board decided to deny Schiller a 2010 bonus. At the same time, the board \\"expressed confidence in Vivian Schiller's leadership going forward.\\" =Resignation from NPR= In March 2011, Vivian Schiller resigned as president and chief executive of National Public Radio amid controversy surrounding the former NPR fundraising executive Ronald Schiller, who is not related to Vivian Schiller. Ronald Schiller has been secretly taped in a sting operation, where during a private conversation with two men posing as potential donors, he derided the \\"tea party\\" movement as a collection of \\"gun- toting\\" racists and \\"fundamentalist Christians\\" who have \\"hijacked\\" the Republican Party. Vivian Schiller's departure was, in part, an attempt to show congressional budget-cutters that NPR could hold itself accountable. Dave Edwards, then chair of the NPR board of directors, sent the following message to the NPR staff regarding the resignation: \\"It is with deep regret that I tell you that the NPR Board of Directors has accepted the resignation of Vivian Schiller as President and CEO of NPR, effective immediately. The Board accepted her resignation with understanding, genuine regret, and great respect for her leadership of NPR these past two years.\\" She was succeeded on an interim basis by Joyce Slocum, the senior vice president of legal affairs and general counsel. NBC News After her resignation from NPR, Schiller was hired by NBC News president Steve Capus to oversee the acquisition of MSNBC Digital Networks, then a joint venture of Microsoft and NBCUniversal. Schiller led the company's efforts to acquire full ownership of the digital operation, and integrate it into the rest of NBC News in New York under a new name, NBCNews.com. That project culminated in the summer of 2013. While at NBCNews.com, Schiller oversaw the acquisition of Stringwire, a live videostreaming platform for breaking news, and oversaw the network's education initiative “Education Nation.” EveryBlock closing and reopening In February 2013, Schiller closed the NBC News-owned site EveryBlock, saying it \\"wasn't a strategic fit.\\" Schiller was widely criticized for her handling of the situation, as the site was turned off one morning with no prior warning to site users and providing no access to archives. Schiller was also criticized for not making a good-faith effort to sell the site before closing it. On the day the site was closed, Schiller said \\"We looked at various options to keep this going, but none of them were viable.\\" Several days after the site had shut down, she said \\"we are continuing to look into options very seriously.\\" EveryBlock founder Adrian Holovaty said she \\"poisoned the pie before trying to sell it.\\" Twitter In January 2014, Schiller joined Twitter as head of news with responsibility for expanding the platform's relationships with news organizations. In July 2014, Global Media Head Katie Stanton expanded Schiller's responsibilities to chair of global news for the company, including setting strategy for partnerships with journalists around the world. Schiller left Twitter in October as part of CEO Dick Costolo's ongoing series of strategic pivots and executive changes and ousters. Present  Since leaving Twitter, Schiller has been working as an independent consultant and advisor to various domestic and international organizations, including to legacy companies as well start-ups such as Vocativ, a data-driven online news provider. Affiliations Schiller is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. She sits on the boards of CUNY Journalism School; the Investigative News Network; Society for Science and the Public; and International Center for Journalism. She was the founding board chair for The News Literary Project.

Stingrays generally do not attack aggressively or even actively defend themselves. When threatened, their primary reaction is to swim away. However, when attacked by predators or stepped on, the stinger in their tail is whipped up. This is normally ineffective against sharks, their main predator. Depending on the size of the stingray, humans are usually stung in the lower limb region. Stings usually occur when swimmers or divers accidentally step on a stingray, but a human is less likely to be stung by simply brushing against the stinger. Surfers and those who enter waters with large populations of stingrays have learned to slide and/or stomp their feet through the sand rather than taking normal steps, as the rays detect the vibrations in the sand and swim away. There are reports of stingers breaking off in wounds, but this may be rare. This would not be fatal to the stingray as it will be regrown at a rate of about per month (though with significant variations depending on the size of the stingray and the exact species). Contact with the stinger causes local trauma (from the cut itself), pain, swelling, and muscle cramps from the venom, and possible later infection from bacteria or fungi. Immediate injuries to humans include envenomation, punctures, severed arteries and veins, and occasionally death. Fatal stings are very rare; when television presenter Steve Irwin was killed in 2006, it was only the second case recorded in Australia since 1945.https://scienceline.org/2006/09/ask-grant-irwin/ In Irwin's case, the stinger penetrated his thoracic wall, causing massive trauma.  Signs and symptoms  Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, extreme pain at the wound, muscle cramps, and a laceration at the puncture site. There have been cases of severe consequences which may include embedded spines, infection, hypotension, and even possible amputations or death. Pain normally lasts up to 48 hours, but is most severe in the first 30–60 minutes and may be accompanied by nausea, fatigue, spreading cramps, headaches, fever, and chills. Stingray wounds have also been found to bleed for a long amount of time after the initial puncture. It had been suggested that there may be some sort of anti-coagulant incorporated with the secreted venom, but James H. Diaz of Louisiana State University has refuted that theory.  Pathophysiology A stingray's barb (ruler in cm). The barb is covered with rows of flat spines, composed of vasodentin. Vasodentin is an incredibly strong cartilaginous material which can easily cut through flesh. The undersides of the spines contain two longitudinal grooves which run along the length of the spine and enclose venom-secreting cells. Both the venom-secreting tissues and vasodentin are enveloped in an epidermis that tears open when the barb is plunged into a victim. Some spines may break off as the barb exits the wound and stay within the victim, causing prolonged envenomation. Treatment Treatment for stings may include application of hot water, which has been shown to ease pain. However, multiple theories as to the mechanism of pain relief from hot water have been suggested. A theory that hot water denatures the stingray venom has been questioned because the temperatures required would need to penetrate deeply into the puncture wound and would likely cause thermal damage to surrounding tissue. Other proposed mechanisms include modulation of pain receptors in the nervous system through mechanism such as the gate control theory and the diffuse noxious inhibitory control theory. Antibiotics may be administered to prevent infection if there is a delay in treatment, if the wound is deep, or if there is a large amount of foreign material in the wound.

NICS was home to Kraken, the most powerful computer in the world managed by academia. The NICS petascale scientific computing environment is housed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), home to the world's most powerful computing complex. The mission of NICS, a member of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE - formerly TeraGrid), is to enable the scientific discoveries of researchers nationwide by providing leading-edge computational resources, together with support for their effective use, and leveraging extensive partnership opportunities. SystemsKraken= Kraken was the University of Tennessee’s petascale computing environment funded by the NSF and fully integrated with XSEDE formerly TeraGrid XD. Kraken was a 1.17-petaflop Cray XT5 system containing 18,816 compute sockets and more than 147 terabytes of memory. In November 2009, it was named the third fastest computer in the world. In its final configuration, the XT5 system delivered in excess of 700 million CPU hours per year. The system was designed specifically for sustained application performance, scalability, reliability and incorporated key elements of the Cray Cascade system. Kraken provided the user community a sustained, high-productivity petascale resource for science and engineering applications. The NSF computer system was co-located with the National Center for Computational Sciences, home of Titan, and other major user facilities at the ORNL campus. =Nautilus= Nautilus is an SGI Altix UV 1000 and the heart of RDAV, the University of Tennessee’s Center for Remote Data Analysis and Visualization sponsored by the National Science Foundation as part of XSEDE, formerly TeraGrid XD. Scientists and engineers are daily producing terabytes of digital data through experimentation, observation and simulation. RDAV's purpose is to aid in the significant challenge of transforming this data into knowledge and insight by providing remote visualization, analysis, and scientific workflow technologies. Nautilus has 1024 cores and 4 terabytes of global shared memory. =Keeneland= NICS operates the Keeneland Initial Delivery system for Georgia Tech. It is composed of an HP SL-390 (Ariston) cluster with Intel Westmere hex-core CPUs, NVIDIA 6GB Fermi GPUs, and a Qlogic QDR InfiniBand interconnect. Each node has two hex-core CPUs and 3 GPUs, with a total of 120 nodes, 240 CPUs and 360 GPUs. =Verne= Verne a 5-node cluster of Dell R505 quad-socket/quad-core Opteron servers dedicated to data analysis and high-end visualization was retired in September 2010. Each node contained 16 processor cores, 128 gigabytes of memory, and 4 terabytes of local disk space. The primary purpose of Verne was to enable data analysis and visualization of simulation data generated on Kraken. =HPSS= The mass storage facility at ORNL currently consists of tape and disk storage components, IBM servers, Linux servers, and High Performance Storage System (HPSS) software. As of January 2009 it stored over 4 petabytes of data in over 11.5 million files. Tape storage is provided by robotic tape libraries. The StorageTek SL8500 libraries can each hold up to 10,000 cartridges and together house a total of thirteen 9840 drives (20 gigabyte cartridges, uncompressed), sixteen 9940B drives (200 gigabyte cartridges, uncompressed), thirty-two T10000A drives (500 gigabyte cartridges, uncompressed), and sixteen T10000B drives (1,000 gigabyte cartridges, uncompressed). The 9840 and 9940A drives read and write uncompressed data at 10 megabytes per second; the 9940B reads and writes at 30 megabytes per second. The beneficial feature of the 9840 tape technology is its fast seek time for small file access; the T10000 tape technology provides the ability to store a larger amount of data on each tape cartridge for more voluminous data sets. Research areas The research areas explored on Kraken include: * Astrophysics – Understanding the mechanism behind supernova explosions. * Biology – Finding a more efficient way to convert cellulose to ethanol. * Climate – Enhancing resolution in the climate models used by policymakers. * Seismology – Finding out where in California the ground would be most susceptible to movement in future earthquakes. * Physics – Revealing the nature of matter from the behavior of molecules to the atoms that make up those molecules, to quarks, electrons, and other fundamental particles.

It frequently goes by the common name 5CB. 5CB was first synthesized by George William Gray, Ken Harrison, and J.A. Nash at the University of Hull in 1972 and at the time it was the first member of the cyanobiphenyls. The liquid crystal was discovered after Gray's group received a grant from the UK Ministry of Defence to find a liquid crystal that had liquid crystal phases near room temperature with the specific intention of using them in liquid crystal displays. The molecule is about 20 Å long. The liquid crystal 5CB undergoes a phase transition from a crystalline state to a nematic state at 24 °C and it goes from a nematic to an isotropic state at 35 °C. Production 5CB is produced by modifying biphenyl in a linear manner. First Br2 is added to the biphenyl to introduce a bromine atom to the end of the moiety. Next aluminium chloride and C4H9COCl is added to the sample, followed by the addition of potassium hydroxide and NH2NH2. By this point the molecule will have a bromine atom on one end of the rigid core and C5H11 on the other end. Finally, introduction of copper(I) cyanide and DMF results in the removal of the bromine and its replacement with CN, yielding 5CB.  Notes  References  *Barois, Philippe (1996). Cristaux liquides.

Until April 2014, Ubuntu One was also a file hosting service and music store that allowed users to store data \\"in the cloud\\". The service enabled users to store files online and sync them between computers and mobile devices, as well as stream audio and music from cloud to mobile devices. In April 2014, Canonical announced that the cloud storage and synchronization features would be shut down at the end of July 31 of 2014, leaving the sign-on features intact. Features Ubuntu One had a client application that ran on Ubuntu 9.04 and later, Windows XP or newer, and Mac OS X 10.6 and higher. Other Linux distributions not running GNOME were supported through a console client. The source code is available through launchpad and can easily be compiled for other Unix-like operating systems such as FreeBSD. There was an Ubuntu One music app for iOS devices. A free Ubuntu One account offered 5 GB of storage. The Ubuntu One service was similar to Microsoft OneDrive, iCloud, Dropbox, Google Play Music, Amazon Cloud Player. Its client code was written in Python. It used Twisted for its low-level networking and Protocol Buffers for protocol description. Data was synced over a custom protocol called \\"u1storage\\", and stored on Amazon S3. Ubuntu One offered automatic upload of photos taken from Android mobile devices for immediate synchronization across computers; integration with Mozilla Thunderbird for contacts and with Tomboy for notes due to the access to the local CouchDB instance. It also had capabilities for purchasing DRM-free music while synchronizing them automatically with an Ubuntu One Account via the Ubuntu One Music Store (in partnership with 7digital). Ubuntu One published APIs for developers wishing to build applications with file and data synchronization or music streaming. An Ubuntu One account gave users access to the Canonical Store, Launchpad, Ubuntu One and other Ubuntu services; an Ubuntu One account allowed users to store files within the cloud, store their contacts details within the interface, access the Ubuntu One Music Store to buy music from and activate the Ubuntu Software Center. Other sites that support OpenID authorization also had support for Ubuntu One. History In June 2013, the Ubuntu Single Sign On account was re-branded under Ubuntu One as part of consolidating Canonical's online services under the Ubuntu One brand. Also, the announcement identified Ubuntu Pay as another service to come under the brand. Following a security breach in July 2013, Canonical put the Ubuntu Forums under the brand, meaning that Forum users now log in using Ubuntu One, rather than with the previous username- password system. On April 2, 2014, Canonical announced shutting down of select Ubuntu One services. As of the day of announcement, it was no longer possible to purchase storage space or music. File services would be unavailable from June 1, but existing users were allowed to download their content until July 31, when all stored data would be permanently deleted. Canonical explained that they were not willing to make more investment in Ubuntu One, which would be required to compete with other services. Instead, their priority is making a \\"converged operating system for phones, tablets, desktops.\\" The company also announced plans to release the source code for the Ubuntu One server software to the public under an open-source license. The shutdown of cloud storage and synchronization services does not affect the single sign-on function of Ubuntu One, which will remain in place. On July 31, 2014 the service was shut down and all of the users' files were deleted. In August 2015 Canonical released the file syncing code under the GNU AGPL. Some other server parts remain to be released with no ETA.https://insights.ubuntu.com/2015/08/10/ubuntu-one-file- syncing-code-open-sourcedhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntuone- servers/+bug/375272 Reception Ubuntu One has been criticized within the Ubuntu community for using proprietary server software. There was no native client integration for the Kubuntu variant of the Ubuntu operating system, as of January 2013. Kubuntu integration was under development and had also received a grant from the Google Summer of Code 2010. Further criticism concerned the unclear revenue share that would be granted to the community. The Amarok development team announced that they would not add support for the Ubuntu One Music Store to the Amarok media player for the moment, unlike the Magnatune media store, which returns 10% of the revenue produced via the interface to Amarok. Storage Storage was out-sourced to Amazon S3. Files stored in the Ubuntu One file stores were not encrypted.

Martel was a steward of King Henry I's royal household from at least 1130. He attested to charters in both England and NormandyHollister, p.362. which indicates that Martel regularly accompanied the king on both sides of the English Channel. Hollister, p.361. Martel was in Normandy with Henry's royal court throughout 1134 and 1135.Crouch, p.32n. After Henry's death, he was present at King Stephen's coronationCrouch, p.32n and p.38. in London on 22 December 1135.Davis, p.16; Poole, p.133.Henry I's daughter Matilda was the designated heir to the throne (Crouch, p.25; Poole, p.131), but when Henry died in December 1135 his nephew Stephen acted quickly to claim the throne (Davis, p.16). David Crouch suggested William Martel as a possible informant for Stephen about Henry's serious illness in late November 1135, allowing Stephen time to prepare his speedy actions on the king's death (Crouch, p.31-32 and 32n). Martel was one of Stephen's most dependable supporters throughout the civil war of 1136–1153, known as The Anarchy.Crouch, p.98 and p.223; Davis, p.142 He witnessed 181 charters for Stephen,Davis, p.67n. demonstrating his frequent attendance in the king's entourage,Davis, p.66. although he received neither an earldom nor any significant estates from Stephen.Crouch, p.340. He was, however, castellan of Sherborne Castle from at least 1141, and may have been castellan from as early as 1139 when the castle was surrendered to King Stephen.Davis, p.73n Between 1141 and 1143, Martel was Stephen's regional military governor in north Dorset and Wiltshire, exercising authority on the king's behalf from Sherborne.Crouch, p.205, 206, 327, 342.

At the council of Winchester, 7–9 April 1141, Martel was one of a delegation of Stephen's supporters that petitioned for the king's release from prison.Crouch, p.173. The delegation was dismissed and Martel was excommunicated by the Bishop of Winchester.Crouch, p.173; Davis, p.53-54.The Bishop of Winchester was Henry of Blois, younger brother of King Stephen (Crouch, p.36; Davis, p.16). At this council of Winchester, the English Church recognised Matilda's claim to the throne (Crouch, p.173). At the Battle of Wilton on 1 July 1143,Davis, p.72n; Crouch, p.207. when King Stephen's forces were dispersed by those of Robert Earl of Gloucester, William Martel led a determined rearguard action that allowed the king to escape.Davis, p.73; Crouch, p.207. Martel was eventually surrounded and captured,Davis, p.73. and to secure his release King Stephen surrendered Sherborne Castle to Robert of Gloucester.Davis, p.73; Crouch, p.208 and p.340; Matthew, p.120. After the loss of Sherborne Castle, Martel continued to be a dominant character at King Stephen's court.Crouch, p.223. In 1147, the abbot of Abingdon sought ecclesiastical sanctions against Martel for attacks that he carried out against the monastery's estates.Matthew, p.121. In 1150,Crouch, p.338. a joint meeting of the county courts of Norfolk and Suffolk, at Norwich, was presided over by William Martel as king's justice.Crouch, p.338; Poole, p.156; Bartlett, p.152. In August 1153, William Martel and other supporters of King Stephen laid waste to the area around Wallingford Castle in an attempt to isolate the army of Henry Plantagenet, who was challenging the king for the throne.Henry Plantagenet was Matilda's son (Davis, p.104; Crouch, p.134; Poole, p.129). Martel's forces were ambushed and routed by Henry's army as it attempted to break out from the blockade.Crouch, p.269. In November 1153 William Martel was one of the 37 witnesses to the Treaty of Westminster which concluded the war between King Stephen and Henry Plantagenet and laid the conditions for Henry's succession.

The motto of the LMHOF is \\"honoring and preserving Louisiana's greatest renewable natural resource.\\" Its primary outreach currently consists of a growing online \\"multimedia virtual museum.\\" The organization is also actively developing partnerships and programs for collections, exhibitions, education aids and programs and performances. The LMHOF also seeks to stimulate economic growth by promoting the rejuvenation of the state's music industry. In one specific example, in 2009 LMHOF facilitated pro bono an advertising endorsement agreement between Al \\"Carnival Time\\" Johnson and the Louisiana Lottery Corp. which resulted in unprecedented media exposure and royalties to Johnson for use of his image,voice and signature song in a scratch ticket promotion during Mardi Gras season. Overview of Louisiana's Music Among the over 250 artists who have been inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame to date are Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, Dave Bartholomew, Elvis Presley, Johnny Rivers, Lloyd Price, Lead Belly, Cosimo Matassa, Louis Armstrong, Mahalia Jackson, Pete Fountain, Buddy Guy, Gov. Jimmie Davis, Ellis Marsalis, Webb Pierce, Dale Hawkins, Louis Prima, Percy Sledge, Irma Thomas, Roy Brown, \\"Dr. John\\" Mac Rebennack, Jelly Roll Morton, Allen Toussaint, Al \\"Carnival Time\\" Johnson, Bill Conti, Tim McGraw, Trace Adkins, Hunter Hayes, Hank Williams Sr. & Jr., and Clarence \\"Frogman\\" Henry. The list of inductees is expected to eventually top 1,000 international luminaries, and the program will expand to include recognition of significant songwriters, support musicians, business icons and regionally famous artists in niche recognition categories. The range of inductees reflects the true diversity of Louisiana's music and its impact on 20th-century music around the world. In the 1920s, Lead Belly and Jelly Roll Morton covered the spectrum arching over blues forms from Shreveport to New Orleans. As eras passed, Louis Armstrong and Louis Prima dominated, Webb Pierce and Gov. Jimmie Davis and country music rolled as Cosimo Matassa recorded \\"Good Rockin' Tonight\\" which spread immediately from New Orleans to Shreveport through The Louisiana Hayride, effectively merging the \\"Hayride\\" and New Orleans genres into a whole new genre. Mahalia Jackson became the dominant gospel artist and Pete Fountain and Al Hirt jazzed the world. In the 1950s and 1960s, the likes of Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, Dale Hawkins, Johnny Rivers, Frogman Henry, Robert Parker, Phil Phillips, John Fred & His Playboys, Jimmy Clanton, The Meters, The Dixie Cups, and Jean Knight dominated the charts and record sales. Even Louisiana's writers like Bobby Charles, Allen Toussaint, Dave Bartholomew and Dick Holler drove the industry with their songs. Throughout this global process, Louisiana continued to grow its own unique and original Cajun, Zydeco and \\"Swamp Pop\\" musical genres. Few people appreciate that in the early 19th century New Orleans was the site of the first opera house in America and produced one of the country's first major composers, Louis Moreau Gottschalk. From Classical to Rock & Roll, Jazz to Rhythm & Blues, Gospel to Country & Western, Louisiana has been integral to American music history and was at the forefront of the music revolutions of the 20th century. Exhibits The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame has launched an innovative LMHOF \\"Multimedia Virtual Museum\\" online concept. While physical exhibits are in the development plans, the Internet now provides people anywhere in the world to visit and immerse themselves in the rich culture of Louisiana music. The GALLERIES MUSIQUE allow visitors to spend as much or as little time as they choose, and visit at any time that they choose. Extensive static images, music files and video albums are provided on each inductee. Digital based movable exhibitions are available whenever and wherever scheduled. The ongoing one-on-one interaction with inductees and future inductees gleans the history and details of the music and artists directly from the artists. Combining and correlating this information with the constant research and discovery of facts and artifacts, and adding the immediate publishing time of the virtual museum, the LMHOF is able to provide the most accurate and current information available anywhere. In July 2015 the LMHOF launched the \\"LMHOF Wall Of Fame at BTR,\\" a truly unique double-sided display consisting of 43 Gold records accompanied by unique artwork honoring 50 LMHOF Inductee members and accompanying dual 50 ultra-flat LED screens giving points of the history of the 50 artists in the Baton Rouge Metro Airport public area. In 2016, the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame has plans to open larger displays featuring more complex Gold record presentations as well as displays featuring artifacts in display of Inductee members in as many as three more locations across the state and a full blown museum display in New Orleans, the home of America's music. Education and preservation Education is the heart of The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame's mission. The organization has plans to create \\"The History of Louisiana Music\\" popular/text book as the forerunner for inclusion of Louisiana music history in curricula in the state's Universities and Junior Colleges. These programs include oral histories, narrated biographies, music and recorded live performances. Louisiana Ticket programming will also be available to the world via the LMHOF web site and, beginning in 2016, through HD air and cable channel television broadcasts throughout most of Louisiana. LMHOF's multimedia virtual museum is rapidly becoming a valuable resource for research on and about Louisiana artists and music. The LMHOF also stores redundant digital files of its entire archives assuring survival of the content. The LMHOF records oral history interviews with inductees and other valued assets wherever possible and records all performances in HD and multi-track digital audio as they archive exclusive and unique performances for historical reference. Many of these oral history pieces can now be found in the virtual museum under the appropriate inductee, as can numerous live performance recordings ever known to exist by many of the inductees. LMHOF has also partnered with the East Baton Rouge Parish Library to be included as a primary link for education and information about Louisiana Music. Louisiana Ticket and Good Rockin' Tonight The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame produces a '\\"Louisiana Ticket'\\" video series, first begun in 1999, as both the official museum broadcast series with in-depth looks at Louisiana's artists and music. The state's legends, landmarks and unsung heroes are explored through insightful features, historical articles, news and reviews. Louisiana Ticket will also soon distribute this programming across the world through the LMHOF Web site and through HD broadcasts throughout Louisiana via cable television networks. Currently, The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame is producing \\"Good Rockin' Tonight,\\" a series of One-hour talk and Live music shows that now number 14 completed shows! And, more to come... History The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame's institutional history began in 1979 when, with help from current driving force Mike Shepherd, Del Moon, a Baton Rouge, La. print and television entertainment journalist first put forward his intent to create the LMHOF. In 1980, a corporation was formed, nonprofit status obtained and the initial project drive began. After several years, Moon back shelved the full-time pursuit of the project, having fought a severe economic recession and having received only cursory cooperation from State and local government and funding entities. Moon allowed the corporation to be dissolved and public work diminished around 1997. Over the years, Moon and Shepherd continued to conceive a better approach from another State while an early adviser in Louisiana continued on with the project's development and archival activities. For a time in the nineties and early 2000s, a non-certified, non- recognized group, out of Lafayette, LA, conducted business using variations of the name, and \\"inducted\\" well over a thousand individuals without even keeping a list of those \\"inductees.\\" That issue is discussed on the LMHOF Official web site in the \\"HISTORY\\" section. All inductees of The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame are included in the list below. The \\"non-certified\\" inductees from that time and dubious effort, are considered to have never been inducted and do not appear on the web site. Even though The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame knows there are well over a thousand individuals who they refer to as \\"non- certified\\" and knows who many of them are, the LMHOF has chosen not to induct these artists in any \\"wholesale\\" manner. In 2005, after several years of pre- development and archival effort, that early adviser, a music industry veteran, Mike Shepherd of Baton Rouge La., took up the gauntlet, establishing a new corporation with IRS 501c3 certification, re-acquired use of The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame name from Louisiana's Secretary Of State (whose predecessor had arguably registered the name to himself in 2004 despite over 20 years of usage at that time) and immediately contacted Moon for continued support and active participation. He got it. Shepherd subsequently reacquired clear registration of the trade name \\"The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame\\" from the newly elected and sitting Louisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedler in early 2011. The new Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame blueprint envisions future public exhibits but immediately took advantage of the Internet by launching a unique multimedia \\"virtual museum\\" from a Web site and began honoring Louisiana musicians who have made significant contributions to the music industry. With so much to work on, the decision was made to reach out to the \\"living legends\\" and surviving family first in an induction plan rather than engage in a time- consuming thematic/historical approach. As Hurricane Katrina ripped New Orleans, it quickly became apparent that digital was the only way to go. An incredible amount of Louisiana's music history washed away overnight. With the cooperation of Governors Kathleen Blanco and Bobby Jindal, the project has quickly become a prototype for the digital age of museums. That web site has now been visited by over 2.35 Million music fans across the world! Plans continue for brick and mortar facilities throughout the State, along with numerous projects designed to aid in heightened global awareness of Louisiana's artists and music, as well as developmental tools and facilities to assist in the resurgence in Louisiana's classic music genres. Over 100 fundraising induction concerts have been staged to date, including \\"Louisiana's Greatest Hits-Live\\" held in Baton Rouge on October 27, 2007 and the Louisiana Music Homecoming on May 16, 2010. In the 2010 Session of the Louisiana Legislature, by unanimous vote of both the State Senate and State House of Representatives on SCR 112, The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame, was commended for its work and further declared as \\"the official honors and recognition organization and information resource for and about Louisiana's music, musicians and musical heritage,\\" thus becoming the first ever Official Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame after thirty years. On January 27, 2014, The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame web site reached the 1,000,000 visit plateau and in October 2015 reached 2.35 Million visits.

History  The church sits on the holy site where a group of unnamed nuns following Gayane and Hripsime were martyred during the time of the conversion of Armenia to Christianity in the year 301 AD. The 5th-century Armenian historian Agathangelos wrote that the young and beautiful Hripsime who at the time was a Christian nun in Rome, was to be forcefully married to the Roman emperor Diocletian. She and the abbess Gayane among other nuns fled the tyrant emperor and left to Armenia. The pagan Armenian King Trdat received a letter from Diocletian in which he described her beauty. Trdat discovered where the nuns were hiding, and fell in love with Hripsime and later Gayane. After their refusal of his advances, Hripsime and Gayane were tortured and martyred separately at the locations of the churches of their names. The remaining thirty-eight nuns were martyred at the location of Shoghakat. The name of the church refers to the ray of light that appeared during the martyrdom of the nuns. During the time that Hripsime was being tortured, Gayane had told her to \\"be of good cheer, and stand firm\\" in her faith. King Trdat was to be later converted to Christianity and made it the official religion of the kingdom.  Architecture  Earlier structures = At the site of the present day church of Shoghakat, there stood an earlier church of the 6th or 7th century which has not survived. It is believed that the structure standing at the site today possibly rests on the foundations of the earlier church (other sources say that Shoghakat may have been built upon the foundations of a 13th-century church). At the southwest end of the building, excavations uncovered the remains of a single-chamber church constructed on a stepped platform, thought to have been a 4th-century memorial chapel. At the southern wall is a small semi-circular apse believed to have served as a southern portico. The bases of the wall piers have features that are characteristic to 4th- and 5th-century Armenian churches. Two portals that led into the chapel were located as well, one to the south and one to the west. = Shoghakat Church = Shoghakat is a domed single-nave basilica with a semi-circular eastern apse flanked on either side by narrow chapels. Some portions of the apse wall could possibly date to the 5th century. Four pendentives help make the transition from the square central bay to the octagonal drum and conical dome above. As in some of the other medieval Armenian churches, the drum and dome are situated off-center and to the west. The main portal into the church leads into the interior from an open gallery adjacent to the western wall of the structure. A lengthy inscription is on the exterior lintel above the door, and is offset by the orangish color of the tufa used. Another smaller portal is at the southern wall. Very little ornamentation adorns the main body of the church except for a geometric pattern that is around the mid-portion of the exterior of the drum, some khachkars built into the upper walls, and a geometric cross design at the exterior of the eastern wall with rosettes and two small cross shaped windows that let some light into the apse of the church. At the western end of the structure is a vaulted open gallery constructed simultaneously with the church. A single large arched opening centered in the middle of the front façade leads into the gallery, where directly across from it is the main portal to the church. Open arched windows are located to either side of the arch on the western wall as well as the walls north and south. The frames surrounding the windows and the large arched entry are highly ornamented with geometric patterns, rosettes, and khachkars. Centered above the gallery is a cupola supported by six-columns that serves as the church's belfry. Foliage patterns adorn each of the six upper exterior of corners of the cupola.

Following a serious eye injury, he spent two seasons in South Africa before moving to the United States for the remainder of his career. He played two seasons in the second division American Soccer League and one in the North American Soccer League. He also finished runner up in the 1986 National Amateur Cup with Atlanta Datagraphics. Since his retirement, he has held numerous coaching and executive positions in the state of Georgia. In 1974, Tutt made his professional debut with Charlton Athletic. He was seventeen at the time. During the 1975–1976 season, he went on loan with Workington FC for four games. In 1976, he suffered an eye injury which put him of action for eighteen months.Goalkeeping: The School of Hard Knocks In 1978, he returned to playing with the Arcadia Sheperds in the South African League. In 1979, he played for the Arcadia Pepsi which may have been the same team, under new sponsorship. During his two seasons in South Africa, he was twice selected as the Goalkeeper of the Year by the South African Press. In 1980, he moved to the United States where he spent one season with the Columbus Magic in the second division American Soccer League. He was an ASL All Star and moved up to the Atlanta Chiefs of the North American Soccer League in 1981. In 1982, he finished his professional career with the Georgia Generals of the ASL. However, he continued to play for several years on the amateur level, ironically, as a forward. In 1983, as part of the Anhauser Busch team, he led the Atlanta District Amateur Soccer League (ADASL) in scoring. In 1984, he moved to Atlanta Datagraphic Soccer Club, also in the ADASL, where he played until 1988. In 1987, Datagraphic fell to Yonkers Polish American Eagles in the final of the National Amateur Cup. He retired from playing in 1988. After his retirement from playing professionally, Tutt turned towards coaching. From 1983 to 2004, he ran various soccer training camps throughout the state of Georgia. In 1988, he established the Canturbury Parks Soccer Complex. In 1989, he founded the Atlanta Attack of the indoor National Professional Soccer League.

They live virtually everywhere where cities exist and the local human population allows, especially in the developing world and the former USSR. Street dogs may be stray dogs, pets which have strayed from or are abandoned by their owners, or may be feral animals that have never been owned. Street dogs may be stray purebreds, true mixed-breed dogs, or unbred landraces such as the Indian pariah dog. Street dog overpopulation can cause problems for the societies in which they live, so campaigns to spay and neuter them are sometimes implemented. They tend to differ from rural free-ranging dogs in their skill sets, socialization, and ecological effects. Problems caused by street dogsBites= Like wolves, to survive, street dogs need to avoid conflict with humans. However, dog bites and dog attacks can occur when dogs are trying to mate or fighting among themselves, and pedestrians and other humans in the vicinity may be bitten by fighting. Rabies is a major problem in some countries. India has more than 30 million stray dogs with more than 20,000 people dying of rabies every year. =Quality of life= Barking and howling and dog fights over mating among dogs can be disturbing to people, and the smell of dog urine which is a product of territory marking may become pungent among unspayed or neutered dogs, not to mention the presence of feces (toxocariasis). Skills and adaptations Dogs are known to be a highly adaptive and intelligent species. To survive in modern cities, street dogs must be able to navigate traffic. Some of the stray dogs in Bucharest are seen crossing the large streets at pedestrian crosswalks. The dogs have probably noticed that when humans cross streets at such markings, cars tend to stop. The dogs have accustomed themselves to the flow of pedestrian and automobile traffic; they sit patiently with the people at the curb when they are stopped for a red light, and then cross with them as if a daily routine. In cities in Russia and several other countries, street dogs are said to have been observed to use subway and bus services. Free-ranging urban dogs by countryAustralia and Oceania=Australia In Australia, comprehensive data are not available, although Death Row Pets estimated 250,000 healthy but unwanted dogs and cats are killed in Australian municipal pounds each year. In recent years, many Australian animal rescue organisations such as Give Our Strays A Chance have stepped forward to rescue as many animals from death row. =South Asia=Afghanistan Nowzad is an organisation in Afghanistan that works to rescue stray dogs in that country. A group of stray dogs became famous in Afghanistan after confronting a suicide bomber, preventing fifty American soldiers from being killed. However, one of the surviving dogs, Target, was mistakenly euthanized when she was brought to the United States. India Stray dogs rescued in Assam, India, by a local dog shelter A Street Dog is drinking water in Howrah, India in the Summer Due to the collapse of vulture populations in India, which formerly consumed large quantities of dead animal carcasses and terminated certain pathogens from the food chain, India's urban street dog populations have exploded and become a health hazard.Markandyaa, Anil; Taylor, Tim; Longo, Alberto; Murtyd, M.N.; Murtyd, S. and Dhavalad, K.; 'Counting the cost of vulture decline—An appraisal of the human health and other benefits of vultures in India'; Ecological Economics 67 (2), 15 September 2008, pp 194–204 Mumbai, for example, has over 12 million human residents, over half of whom are slum- dwellers. At least five hundred tons of garbage remain uncollected daily. Therefore, conditions are perfect for supporting a particularly large population of stray dogs. In 2001, a law passed in India making the killing of stray dogs illegal has exacerbated the problems related to street dogs, increasing the street dog population and causing rabies cases in humans to rise. India has the highest number of human rabies deaths in the world (estimated at 20,000 per year). \\"Catch and kill\\" programmes have been a traditional solution to overwhelming dog populations, but there are also programmes such as the Animal Birth Control-Anti-Rabies (ABC-AR) programme started by Blue Cross of India based in Chennai, India. Several dog shelters throughout India emphasize the rescue of stray dogs, especially in South and North eastern parts of India. Pakistan In Pakistan, several dog breeds exist including the Gaddi Kutta, Indian pariah dog, Bully Kutta, among others. In the city of Lahore, the Public Health Department launched a campaign to kill 5,000 stray dogs. In 2009, 27,576 dogs were killed within the city of Lahore; in 2005, this number was 34,942. In 2012, after 900 dogs were killed in the city of Multan, the Animal Safety Organisation in Pakistan sent a letter to Chief Minister (CM) Shahbaz Sharif recommending that \\"stray dogs be vaccinated rather than killed.\\" Sri Lanka In Sri Lanka, there is a No-Kill Policy for street dogs, hence neutering and vaccinating are encouraged. Despite the proposal for an updated Animal Welfare Act, century-old law against animal cruelty still exist, so they are subjected to cruelty in various forms. =Europe=Italy Around 80% of abandoned dogs die early due to lack of survival skills. Romania Feral puppies in Bucharest In Romania, free-ranging urban dogs (called in Romanian câini maidanezi, literally \\"wasteland dogs\\", câini comunitari \\"community dogs\\", etc.) have been a huge problem in recent decades, especially in larger cities, with many people being bitten by dogs. The problem originates primarily in the systematization programme that took place in Communist Romania in the 1970s and 1980s under Nicolae Ceaușescu, who enacted a mass programme of demolition and reconstruction of existing villages, towns, and cities, in whole or in part, in order to build standardized blocks of flats (blocuri). The dogs from the yards of the demolished houses were abandoned on the streets, and reproduced, multiplying their numbers throughout the years. Estimations for Bucharest vary widely, but the number of stray dogs has been reduced drastically in 2014, after the death of a 4-year-old child in 2013 who was attacked by a dog. The Bucharest City Hall stated that over 51,200 stray dogs were captured from October 2013 to January 2015, with more than half being euthanized, about 23,000 being adopted, and 2,000 still residing in the municipality's shelters. Russia Stray dog eating from a garbage can in Moscow In Russia, stray dogs have been caught by doghunters' vans and destroyed since ca. 1900. The number of street dogs in Moscow is estimated to be up to 50,000 animals. Their sad lot was dramatized by Anton Chekhov in the famous short story Kashtanka, by Mikhail Bulgakov in the novella Heart of a Dog, and by Gavriil Troyepolsky in the novel White Bim Black Ear. When the number of street dogs massively increased in the 1990s and in the beginning of the new millennium it came to many attacks on human, the dogs were hunted and killed. In recent years the attitude and strategy towards street dogs has changed. The dogs are caught, sterilized and it is ensured that the dogs have enough to eat. The dogs keep the city free of food leftovers and rats. Since 2002 in Moscow there exists a monument dedicated to the stray dog called Malchik (Eng: \\"Little boy\\"). Stray dogs in Moscow have adapted their behavior to traffic and the life of Moscow. The dogs even ride the metro and understand the rules of traffic lights and are often called Moscow's metro dogs. Serbia Street dog in city of Valjevo, Serbia. Free-ranging dogs are a serious problem of the Serbian cities and rural areas. The total number of free-ranging dogs in Serbia is estimated at several tens of thousands, of which the largest groups can be found in Belgrade (more than 17,000), Novi Sad (about 10,000), Niš (between 7,000 and 10,000), Subotica (about 8,000) and Kragujevac (about 5,000). zoipet.com =North America=United States Each year, approximately 2.7 million dogs and cats are euthanized because shelters are too full and there are not enough adoptive homes.

Freedom of religion Saudi Arabia mostly colored in light blue (Sunni hanbali). Saudi Arabia is an Islamic theocracy. Religious minorities do not have the right to practice their religion. Non-Muslim propagation is banned, and conversion from Islam to another religion is punishable by death as apostasy.Sheen J. Freedom of Religion and Belief: A World Report. (Routledge, 1997) p.452. Proselytizing by non-Muslims, including the distribution of non-Muslim religious materials such as Bibles, Bhagavad Gita, Ahmedi Books are illegal. In late 2014 a law was promulgated calling for the death penalty for anyone bringing into the country \\"publications that have a prejudice to any other religious beliefs other than Islam\\" (thought to include non-Muslim religious books). The annual report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) tagged Saudi Arabia along with 15 other nations as “countries of particular concern” for engaging in or tolerating “systematic, ongoing, egregious violations”. Religious groupsIslam= Non-Muslims are barred from entering the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. The official form of Islam is Sunni of the Hanbali school, in its Salafi version.Robert Murray Thomas Religion in Schools: Controversies Around the World Greenwood Publishing Group 2006 page 180 According to official statistics, 75–85% of Saudi Arabian citizens are Sunni Muslims, 10–15% are Shia. (More than 30% of the population is made up of foreign workers who are predominantly but not entirely Muslim.) It is unknown how many Ahmadis there are in the country, Ahmadis are not recognized by Saudi Arabia. The two holiest cities of Islam, Mecca and Medina, are in Saudi Arabia. For many reasons, non-Muslims are not permitted to enter the holy cities although some Western non-Muslims have been able to enter, disguised as Muslims.(Sir Richard Burton in 1853) The Highly Civilized Man: Richard Burton and the Victorian world By Dane KENNEDY, Dane Keith Kennedy Harvard University Press(Ludovico di Barthema in 1503) The Arabian Nights: The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night (1001 Nights ...) edited by Richard F. Burton =Non-Muslims= The large number of foreign workers living in Saudi Arabia (8 million expatriates out of a total population of 27 million) includes non-Muslims. For non-Sunni Muslims, non-Muslims, and non- religious, \\"freedom of religion is neither recognized nor protected under the law\\" and Saudi \\"government policies continued to place severe restrictions on religious freedom\\", according to the 2013 International Religious Freedom Report of the U.S. State Department. According to Human Rights Watch, the Shia Muslim minority face systematic discrimination from the Saudi Arabian government in education, the justice system and especially religious freedom. Shias also face discrimination in employment and restrictions are imposed on the public celebration of Shia festivals such as Ashura and on the Shia taking part in communal public worship.Islamic Political Culture, Democracy, and Human Rights: A Comparative Study, p 93 Daniel E. Price – 1999 As no faith other than Islam is permitted to be practiced, no churches, temples, or other non-Muslim houses of worship are permitted in the country although there are nearly a million Christians as well as Hindus and Buddhists—nearly all foreign workers—in Saudi Arabia. Private prayer services are suppressed, and the Saudi Arabian religious police reportedly regularly search the homes of Christians. Foreign workers are not allowed to celebrate Christmas or Easter. In 2007, Human Rights Watch requested that King Abdullah stop a campaign to round up and deport foreign followers of the Ahmadiyya faith. Proselytizing by non- Muslims is illegal, and conversion by Muslims to another religion (apostasy) carries the death penalty (though there have been no confirmed reports of executions for apostasy in recent years). Religious inequality extends to compensation awards in court cases. Once fault is determined, a Muslim receives all of the amount of compensation determined, a Jew or Christian half, and all others a sixteenth. Saudi Arabia has officially identified atheists as terrorists., Saudi Arabia declares all atheists are terrorists in new law to crack down on political dissidents, The Independent, 04 March 2014 Saudi Arabians or foreign residents who call \\"into question the fundamentals of the Islamic religion on which this country is based\\" may be subject to as much as 20 years in prison. Policy of exclusion According to scholar Bernard Lewis, the Saudi Arabian policy of excluding non-Muslim from permanent residence in the Arabian peninsula is a continuation of an old and widely accepted Muslim policy: > The classical Arabic historians tell us that in the year 20 after the hijra > (Muhammad's move from Mecca to Medina), corresponding to 641 of the > Christian calendar, the Caliph Umar decreed that Jews and Christians should > be removed from Arabia to fulfill an injunction Muhammad uttered on his > deathbed: \\"Let there not be two religions in Arabia.\\" The people in question > were the Jews of the oasis of Khaybar in the north and the Christians of > Najran in the south. [The hadith] was generally accepted as authentic, and > Umar put it into effect. Compared with European expulsions, Umar's decree > was both limited and compassionate. It did not include southern and > southeastern Arabia, which were not seen as part of Islam's holy land. ... > the Jews and Christians of Arabia were resettled on lands assigned to them – > the Jews in Syria, the Christians in Iraq. The process was also gradual > rather than sudden, and there are reports of Jews and Christians remaining > in Khaybar and Najran for some time after Umar's edict. But the decree was > final and irreversible, and from then until now the holy land of the Hijaz > has been forbidden territory for non-Muslims. According to the Hanbali > school of Islamic jurisprudence, accepted by both the Saudi Arabians and the > declaration's signatories, for a non-Muslim even to set foot on the sacred > soil is a major offense. In the rest of the kingdom, non-Muslims, while > admitted as temporary visitors, were not permitted to establish residence or > practice their religion. While Saudi Arabia does allow non-Muslims to live in Saudi Arabia to work, they may not practice religion publicly. According to the government of the United Kingdom: > The public practice of any form of religion other than Islam is illegal; as > is an intention to convert others. However, the Saudi Arabian authorities > accept the private practice of religions other than Islam, and you can bring > a Bible into the country as long as it is for your personal use. Importing > larger quantities than this can carry severe penalties. Christianity Estimates of the number of Christians in Saudi Arabia include 1,500,000 (Memri.org) All Christians in the Kingdom are foreign workers. Christians have complained of religious persecution by authorities. In one case in December 2012, 35 Ethiopian Christians working in Jeddah (six men and 29 women who held a weekly evangelical prayer meeting) were arrested and detained by the kingdom’s religious police for holding a private prayer gathering. While the official charge was “mixing with the opposite sex” — a crime for unrelated people in Saudi Arabia — the offenders complained they were arrested for praying as Christians. A 2006 report in Asia News states that there are \\"at least one million\\" Roman Catholics in the kingdom. It states that they are being \\"denied pastoral care ... Catechism for their children – nearly 100,000 – is banned.\\" It reports the arrest of a Catholic priest for saying mass in 2006. \\"Fr. George [Joshua] had just celebrated mass in a private house when seven religious policemen (muttawa) broke into the house together with two ordinary policemen. The police arrested the priest and another person.\\"\\"Catholic priest arrested and expelled from Riyadh\\" , Asia News, Italy, 10 April 2006. According to the Middle East editor of The Economist magazine, Nicolas Pelham, the kingdom contains \\"perhaps the largest and fastest-growing Christian community in the Middle East\\" and strict religious laws -- such as banning Christians from Mecca and Medina -- are not always enforced: > Though Christians are forbidden from worshiping publicly, congregations at > weekly prayer meetings on foreign compounds can be several hundred strong. In 2018, it was reported that the religious police had stopped enforcing the ban on Christians religious services anywhere in the Kingdom whether publicly or privately, and for the first time, a \\"documented Christian service\\" was openly conducted. Sometime before 1 December 2018, a Coptic Mass was performed in the city of Riyadh by Ava Morkos, Coptic Bishop of Shobra Al-Kheima in Egypt, during his visit to Saudi Arabia (according to Egyptian and other Arab media).Coptstoday.com, December 1, 2018. Ava Morkos was originally invited to Saudi Arabia by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman in March 2018. Hinduism As of 2001, there were an estimated 1,500,000 Indian nationals in Saudi Arabia,Report of the High Level Committee on the Indian Diaspora. Countries of the Gulf Region most of them Muslims, but some Hindus. Like other non-Muslim religions, Hindus are not permitted to worship publicly in Saudi Arabia. There have also been some complaints of destruction of Hindu religious items by Saudi Arabian authorities.On 24 March 2005, Saudi Arabian authorities destroyed religious items found in a raid on a makeshift Hindu shrine found in an apartment in Riyadh. (source: Marshall, Paul. Saudi Arabia's Religious Police Crack Down. Freedom House)Hindus in the Middle East BY: Gautam Raja(June 2001) Belief Net =Irreligion= Disbelief in God is a capital offense in the kingdom. Traditionally, influential conservative clerics have used the label ‘atheist’ to apply not to those who profess to believe that God does not exist, but to \\"those who question their strict interpretations of Islamic scriptures or express doubts about\\" Wahhabism. Examples of those so condemned (but not executed) are *Hamza Kashgari, who was jailed for 20 months after tweeting some unconventional thoughts about Muhammad, \\"none of which indicated he did not believe in God\\". *Raif Badawi (editor of the Free Saudi Liberals website), who was sentenced to 1000 lashes, ten years in prison and fined 1 million riyal (equal to about $267,000) in 2014 after he was convicted of insulting Islam on his website and on television. The original 2013 sentence was seven years and 600 lashes, but was changed on appeal. In February/March 2014, a series of new anti-terrorism laws were decreed. Article 1 of the law also conflated atheism and religious dissent, outlawing \\"calling for atheist thought in any form, or calling into question the fundamentals of the Islamic religion on which this country is based\\". According to \\"anecdotal, but persistent\\" evidence, since sometime around 2010, the number of atheists in the kingdom has been growing. According to some estimates, Saudi Arabia is claimed to have the highest rate of atheists in the Arab World and is the first Muslim-majority country to have its atheist population exceed five per cent.el-Sayyed, Alaaeddin الإلحاد في السعودية هو الأعلى عربيًّا.

She dedicated her life to teaching and sharing memories of the Holocaust. Her speeches painted a realistic portrait of what a Jewish girl from Poland went through between 1939 and 1945. Biterman's story differs from the stories of other Jewish Holocaust survivors because she was forced to abandon her identity during the war years, live an underground existence, and never was in a Concentration Camp. She was in the Dubno ghetto in Poland, but managed to escape with the help of a non- Jewish man she knew. During the period of 1939–1945, she was separated from her family and entirely removed from Jewish life. Biography1917–1939= Biterman was born and raised in Zamość, Poland, the oldest daughter of a cap maker. When she was 18, she, her parents and her five younger siblings fled their home for what is now Ukraine, thinking life under the Russians would be better for Jews. =1939–1945= Believing they would be able to continue to see her, Biterman’s family left her in what is now Ukraine because she had a job. Meanwhile, they went to a different part of the former Soviet Union. \\"But it didn’t work out ... because [subsequently] Germany started the war and then I was on my own. I was very naïve, but God gave me so much strength and so much courage.\\"Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle, The burden and responsibility of retelling http://www.jewishchronicle.org/article.php?article_id=6123, 2007. Biterman was first hidden, then passed as a German from the Black Forest. She survived by staying on the move, working when she could get work, and staying alert to the suspicions and accusations of Poles and Ukrainians who \\"always looked for Jews and hunted us out.\\" [One of] her many harrowing experiences included having guns held to her head to coerce her into confessing that she was a Jew. \\"I was very strong and life was precious. I didn’t want to die from a bullet.\\" =1948–2019= In 1948 Biterman and her husband Judah (also a Holocaust survivor) emigrated to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. There they came to learn the American way of life, raise their children, and earn a living. =Speaking and Volunteering= Biterman spoke about her experience to a variety of groups including numerous schools, universities, synagogues, and civic groups in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. At the time of her death in 2019, she was one of the few remaining Holocaust survivors in the entire state of Wisconsin. She never refused a request to talk about her personal Holocaust experience because \\"it’s important for young people to know about the Holocaust so it shouldn’t happen again.\\" =Advocacy and Awareness= Biterman believed the Holocaust would never have happened if the Jewish people had their own space. \\"A people without a home is not respected and [other nations] do with you what they want.\\" She was a strong and vocal advocate for Holocaust education and a steadfast supporter of Israel.

An artist with the gift of an undeniable talent who, in spite of living within the moral repressions and strict conventional customs of a Guatemalan time outlined by a dictatorship (Manuel Estrada Cabrera), he was able to develop one of the most important works for art history in the 20th century. He is considered as pioneer of modern Guatemalan art.  Biography  Born in Paris on November 15, 1888, he was the third son of Carlos Valenti Sorie, born in Italy, and Helena Perrillat-Bottonet, born in Le Grand Bornand, Haute-Savoie, France. Valenti arrived to Guatemala together with his mother and two brothers to join his father, who was already living in the country since 1888. Since he was a child, he stood out as a brilliant and ingenious student, and was awarded a gold medal as the best student. He was the favorite piano student of professor Herculano Alvarado. Later on, as a student at the Fine Arts Academy, he awed professor Santiago González because of his excellent drawing ability. Valenti was part of a group of artists, poets, and writers like Carlos Wyld Ospina, Rafael Rodríguez Padilla, Rafael Arévalo Martínez, Rafael Yela Günther, the De la Riva siblings and Carlos Mérida, who worked very closely with Jaime Sabartés, Catalan who came to Guatemala from Barcelona, who held a close friendship with Pablo Picasso, and worked as his private secretary since 1935. Among that group of gifted artists, Valenti was like the lighthouse that illuminated everything, who knew how to be a friend and who became one of the masters. At 22, he already had what was called “a style”. His authentic genius expressed itself from his beginnings without hesitation, without wavering. For the time Valenti lived in, his work had an unlimited daring boldness. Since he took the pencil, his stroke was categorical and final. Through his art, Valenti’s art expressed a feeling, transmitting his own internal vision. During his learning stage, his work was samples of skill and ability using academic models supported on traditional methods. It is precisely in his oil landscape paintings where we find a gentle Valenti, and in contradiction with a suicidal figure of his last days. The harmony of his color and the simplification process of his brush strokes recall the spirit that motivated the Impressionists school. His drawings and his hues with uncommon topics for that time define Valenti as a singular artist, in whom the searching spirit of conflicts that originate our existence was born. Some have considered him as the first expressionist in the Guatemalan painting. In 1912, together with painter Carlos Mérida, Valenti traveled to Paris, France, to continue studying painting. Shortly after his arrival, they visited Pablo Picasso to hand him a letter from Jaime Sabartés, referring them to him for his guidance in choosing an academy or a master for their painting classes. That is how both registered at the Vitty Academy, where they became disciples of the Dutch Kees van Dongen and the Spanish Hermenegildo Anglada Camarasa. In time, Carlos Valenti started to notice that his diabetes, which he had suffered since very young, was affecting his vision more every day. Upon consultation with a specialist in Paris, he ordered him to rest and stay completely away from painting. This situation immersed him in a deep depression when all his plans became frustrated, and when he lost the main reason of his existence: Art. Two years before he had written: “… there are some among us that have the real faith – Art – for which you have to sacrifice yourself stepping over everything, to whom you have to render homage as a deity, give everything up for it; live only for your work… there, in the canvas, deposit an entire life, all our love; transmit to the painting everything that cannot be explained; live in it, deposit all our being, all the most saintly emotions that the artists’ heart experiences..” His end was tragic, as other artists’ ends were. When he was unable to devote himself totally to his passion – art – on October 29, 1912, he cut short his live with two shots to his chest. He was buried at the Montparnasse cemetery in a cold and rainy November morning. Some of his works belong to the collection of the Museo Nacional de Arte Moderno \\"Carlos Mérida\\" in Guatemala City.Carlos Mauricio Valenti Perrillat (Spanish) at Literatura Guatemalteca Carlos Mauricio Valenti Perrillat (Spanish), Latin Art Museum.

The Balamuthia amoebae can then travel to the brain through the bloodstream and cause GAE. GAE is a very rare disease that is usually fatal. Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) first discovered Balamuthia mandrillaris in 1986. The amoeba was found in the brain of a dead mandrill. After extensive research, B. mandrillaris was declared a new species in 1993.

A previous article, from October 1965, had investigated a trend among 1960s theologians to write God out of the field of theology. The 1966 article looked in greater depth at the problems facing modern theologians, in making God relevant to an increasingly secular society. Modern science seemed to have had eliminated the need for religion to explain the natural world, and God took up less and less space in people's daily lives. The ideas of various scholars were brought in, including the application of contemporary philosophy to the field of theology, and a more personal, individual approach to religion. The issue drew heavy criticism, both from the broader public and from clergymen. Much of the criticism was directed at the provocative magazine cover, rather than the content of the article. The coverall black with the words \\"Is God Dead?\\" in large red textmarked the first time in the magazine's history that text with no accompanying image was used. In 2008, the Los Angeles Times named the \\"Is God Dead?\\" issue among \\"12 magazine covers that shook the world\\".https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la- et-10magazinecovers14-july14-pg-photogallery.html Background In 1966, Otto Fuerbringer had been editor of the news magazine Time for six years. He helped to increase the circulation of the magazine, partly by changing its rather austere image. Though a conservative himself, he made the magazine focus extensively on the counter-culture and the political and intellectual radicalism of the 1960s. A best-selling 1964 issue, for instance, had dealt with the sexual revolution. Already in October 1965 the magazine had published an article on the new radical theological movement. The April 8, 1966, cover of Time magazine was the first cover in the magazine's history to feature only type, and no photo. The coverwith the traditional, red borderwas all black, with the words \\"Is God Dead?\\" in large, red text. The question was a reference to Friedrich Nietzsche's much-quoted postulate \\"God is dead\\" (), which he first proposed in his 1882 book The Gay Science. Themes presented by the articleThe problems= The article accompanying the magazine cover, titled \\"Toward a Hidden God\\" and written by religion editor John T. Elson, mentioned the so-called \\"God Is Dead\\" movement only briefly in its introduction. In a footnote it identified the leaders of the movement as \\"Thomas J. J. Altizer of Emory University, William Hamilton of Colgate Rochester Divinity School, and Paul van Buren of Temple University\\", and explained how these theologians had been trying to construct a theology without God. This theme had already been dealt with in greater detail in the shorter and less prominent article \\"The \\"God Is Dead\\" Movement\\", on October 22, 1965.This article also mentioned Gabriel Vahanian of Syracuse University, in addition to the three men named above; The article pointed out that while this movement had roots in the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, it also drew on a broader range of thinkers. For example, philosophers and theologians like Søren Kierkegaard and Dietrich Bonhoeffer expressed concerns about the role of God in an increasingly secularised world. The immediate reality did not indicate a death of God or religion; Pope John XXIII's Second Vatican Council had done much to revitalize the Roman Catholic Church, while in the United States, as many as 97% declared a belief in God. Evangelical ministers such as Billy Graham and Christian artists like the playwright William Alfred could be brought as witness to the continued vitality of the Christian church. Nevertheless, this religiosity was mostly skin-deep; only 27% of Americans called themselves deeply religious. The article then went on to explain the history of monotheism, culminating in the omnipresent Catholic church of the European Middle Ages. This zenith, however, was, according to the article, the beginning of the demise of Christianity: as society became increasingly secularised, the religious sphere of society became marginalised. Scientific discovery, from the Copernican Revolution to Darwin's theory of evolution, eliminated much of the need for religious explanations to life. Newton and Descartes were perhaps personally devout men, but their discoveries \\"explained much of nature that previously seemed godly mysteries.\\" =Possible solutions= Having laid out the philosophical and historical background, the article then asserted that there was still much curiosity among the general population about God and His relation to the world, and that for the modern theologian who wished to address this curiosity, there seemed to be four options: According to the article, some contemporary ministers and theologians chose to focus on the life and teachings of Jesus, rather than on God, since Christ was a figure with great appeal among the broader population, but this solution ran dangerously close to ethical humanism. Biblical literalism, on the other hand, might have had an appeal to the fervent believer, but did not speak to most people in a world where the language of the Bible was increasingly unfamiliar. The article described other attempts that had been made to solve to the problems of religion, including the adaptation of contemporary philosophical terminology to explain God, and cited efforts made to adapt the writings of Martin Heidegger and Alfred North Whitehead to modern theology. At the same time it noted that Ian Ramsey of Oxford had spoken of so-called \\"discernment situations\\"; situations in life that led man to question his own existence and purpose, and turn towards a greater power. The article concluded that the current crisis of faith could be healthy for the church, and that it might force clergymen and theologians to abandon previously held certainties: \\"The church might well need to take a position of reverent agnosticism regarding some doctrines that it had previously proclaimed with excessive conviction.\\" Reaction April 13, 2009, cover of Newsweek magazine The publication of the article immediately led to a public backlash. Editorial pages of newspapers received numerous letters from angry readers, and clergymen vehemently protested the content of the article. Even though the article itself explored the theological and philosophical issues in depth, \\"[m]any people...were too quick to judge the magazine by its cover and denounced Time as a haven of godlessness\\". For Time the issue caused around 3,500 letters to the editorthe largest number of responses to any one story in the history of the magazine. Reader criticism was targeted at Thomas J. J. Altizer in particular. Altizer left Emory in 1968, and by the end of the decade the \\"death of God\\" movement had lost much of its momentum. In its issue of December 26, 1969, Time ran a follow-up cover story asking, \\"Is God Coming Back to Life\\"? The magazine cover also entered the realm of popular culture: in a scene from the 1968 horror movie Rosemary's Baby, the protagonist Rosemary Woodhouse picks up the issue in a doctor's waiting room. The \\"Is God Dead?\\" issue was to have an enduring place in American journalism. In 2008, the Los Angeles Times listed the issue in a featured titled \\"10 magazine covers that shook the world\\". In April 2009, Newsweek magazine ran a special report on the decline of religion in the United States under the title \\"The End of Christian America\\". This article also referenced the radical \\"death of God\\" theological movement of the mid-1960s. The front cover carried the title \\"The Decline and Fall of Christian America\\" in red letters on a black background, reminiscent of the 1966 Time cover. The April 3, 2017 cover of Time featured a cover that asked \\"Is Truth Dead?\\" in a similar style to the iconic \\"Is God Dead?\\" cover, in a cover story about the alleged falsehoods perpetuated by President Donald Trump.

The Lakefront Anchorage Hotel is operated as part of the Millennium & Copthorne Hotels chain. It has 248 guest rooms, laundry services, multiple meeting and events facilities, exercise room, and 2 restaurants known as \\"The Flying Machine\\", which serves breakfast all year, and dinner in the summer, and the \\"Fancy Moose Lounge\\" which serves lunch and dinner all year long. During the summer months they open up the deck area for guest to sit and dine, all while watching the float planes fly by. It opened in 1986 as the Clarion, then 1992 Regal Alaska Hotel, then in 2001 The Millennium Alaska Hotel, and when the hotel remodeled in 2015 it became the now, Lakefront Anchorage Hotel. Since it opened it has been the operational headquarters of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.  History  Joe Spenard found the future site of this hotel by a moose trail, now Spenard RD, in 1922. This heavily forested area was considered a remote settlement and, after Spenard Resort was build, was an excuse for the citizens of Anchorage to “Get Out Of Town\\". Spenard Resort was a clapboard building with a veranda. Tourists were invited to swim in the lake, relax on the veranda and picnic on the grounds. On the night of May 24, 1917, a fire, probably set by careless hunters, completely destroyed Spenard's houses, the dance pavilion, picnic tables, and other improvements. The business was a total loss, reported at $2,000, as he lacked fire insurance. Shortly afterwards, he broke his leg and a heart condition grew worse, which made it difficult to carry on his transfer business. In September 1917, he sold his yellow car and business, and the Spenards headed to the Lower forty-eight states for the winter, promising to return in the spring, but never did. In 1938 the property was rebuilt and became the Idle Hour Country Club, a supper club with a sunken dance floor and a glass wall view to the lake. This club was the social hub of for several years, hosting many major functions. Oddly enough, considering that the then-named Town of Spenard was second is size to Anchorage on the State map, getting out to the Country Club was almost as difficult for guests as it was for our lost settler. The trail was still unpaved and riddled with Alaskan-sized, and often life-threatening potholes. Occasionally “someone might throw some gravel in the worst of them,” says a long-time resident of the area. The building was destroyed by fire in 1952, and again in 1956. After this, owner after owner went bankrupt trying to re-establish the former glory of the Idle Hour, until 1970 when Terry Miller opened the Fancy Moose Inn. The Fancy Moose, named after Terry's wife, Fancy, was a supper club and a motel with 20 unites. The “Moose” part of the name came from the unusually large moose rack, shot with a bow and arrow by Terry himself, which hung in the original Fancy Moose. Today the moose rack can be seen in our lobby above the stone fireplace, too large to fit into the Fancy Moose Lounge. In 1972, The Fancy Moose, having been remodeled into two separate rooms, because the Fancy Moose Supper Club in the front section, and “unofficially,” “The Rock in the Rear” in the back. Trouble with the local liquor licensing board followed this unauthorized use of the liquor license. Difficulties piled up, and by the 1975 the Fancy Moose liquor license was declared dead by reason of “non-renewal\\". Beginning in 1978, the Fancy Moose became the Flying Machine and the Flying Machine Mexican Restaurant. While the Flying Machine was successful for several years, the Mexican Restaurant was an instant failure and was succeeded by such establishments as the Red Baron, the Co-Pilot Club, the Oar House, and finally the Fly-By-Night Club. In 1985, the Fly-By-Night Club moved up the road and the old building was torn down to make way for the Clarion Anchorage Hotel. The hotel opened on June 1, 1986. In 1992, the hotel's name was changed to the Regal Alaskan Hotel, which it remained until 2001. In deference to former owners of the site, the hotel named their restaurant the Flying Machine and the lounge-café the Fancy Moose lounge. The Flying Machine Restaurant, Fancy Moose Lounge, and the hotel lobby all contain historic photos of the aviation pioneers and personalities that created the character of the “Last Frontier.” References Category:Buildings and structures in Anchorage, Alaska Category:Hotels in Alaska Category:Hotels established in 1986 Category:1986 establishments in Alaska ","title":"Millennium Alaskan Hotel"},{"id":"22778028","text":"View of Nederbrakel from the Uitkijktoren (Watch Tower) Nederbrakel is a village in the municipality of Brakel.

The feature serves a role similar to data structures in a programming language and allows a type theory to add concepts like numbers, relations, and trees. As the name suggests, inductive types can be self-referential, but usually only in a way that permits structural recursion. The standard example is encoding the natural numbers using Peano's encoding. Inductive nat : Type :=  0 : nat  S : nat -> nat. Here, a natural number is created either from the constant \\"0\\" or by applying the function \\"S\\" to another natural number. \\"S\\" is the successor function which represents adding 1 to a number. Thus, \\"0\\" is zero, \\"S 0\\" is one, \\"S (S 0)\\" is two, \\"S (S (S 0))\\" is three, and so on. Since their introduction, inductive types have been extended to encode more and more structures, while still being predicative and supporting structural recursion.  Elimination  Inductive types usually come with a function to prove properties about them. Thus, \\"nat\\" may come with: nat_elim : (forall P : nat -> Prop, (P 0) -> (forall n, P n -> P (S n)) -> (forall n, P n)). This is the expected function for structural recursion for the type \\"nat\\".  Implementations  W- and M-types = W-types are well-founded types in intuitionistic type theory (ITT). They generalize natural numbers, lists, binary trees, and other \\"tree-shaped\\" data types. Let be a universe of types. Given a type : and a dependent family : → , one can form a W-type \\\\mathsf{W}_{a:A} B(a). The type may be thought of as \\"labels\\" for the (potentially infinitely many) constructors of the inductive type being defined, whereas indicates the (potentially infinite) arity of each constructor. W-types (resp. M-types) may also be understood as well-founded (resp. non-well-founded) trees with nodes labeled by elements : and where the node labeled by has ()-many subtrees. Each W-type is isomorphic to the initial algebra of a so-called polynomial functor. Let 0, 1, 2, etc. be finite types with inhabitants 11 : 1, 12, 22:2, etc. One may define the natural numbers as the W-type : \\\\mathbb{N}:= \\\\mathsf{W}_{x:\\\\mathbf{2}} f(x) with : 2 → is defined by (12) = 0 (representing the constructor for zero, which takes no arguments), and (22) = 1 (representing the successor function, which takes one argument). One may define lists over a type : as \\\\operatorname{List}(A) := \\\\mathsf{W}_{(x:\\\\mathbf{1}+A)} f(x) where : \\\\begin{align} f(\\\\operatorname{inl}(1_{\\\\mathbf{1}})) &= \\\\mathbf{0}  f(\\\\operatorname{inr}(a)) &= \\\\mathbf{1} \\\\end{align} and 11 is the sole inhabitant of 1. The value of f(\\\\operatorname{inl}(1_{\\\\mathbf{1}})) corresponds to the constructor for the empty list, whereas the value of f(\\\\operatorname{inr}(a)) corresponds to the constructor that appends to the beginning of another list. The constructor for elements of a generic W-type \\\\mathsf{W}_{x:A}B(x) has type : \\\\mathsf{sup}:\\\\prod_{a:A}\\\\Big(B(a)\\\\to\\\\mathsf{W}_{x:A}B(x)\\\\Big)\\\\to \\\\mathsf{W}_{x:A}B(x). We can also write this rule in the style of a natural deduction proof, : \\\\frac{ a:A \\\\qquad f:B(a)\\\\to\\\\mathsf{W}_{x:A}B(x) }{ \\\\mathsf{sup}(a,f):\\\\mathsf{W}_{x:A}B(x) }. The elimination rule for W-types works similarly to structural induction on trees. If, whenever a property (under the propositions-as-types interpretation) C : \\\\mathsf{W}_{x:A}B(x) \\\\to U holds for all subtrees of a given tree it also holds for that tree, then it holds for all trees. : \\\\frac{ w:\\\\mathsf{W}_{a:A}B(a) \\\\qquad a:A, \\\\; f:B(a)\\\\to\\\\mathsf{W}_{x:A}B(x), \\\\; c:\\\\prod_{b:B(a)} C(f(b)) \\\\;\\\\vdash\\\\; h(a,f,c):C(\\\\mathsf{sup}(a,f)) }{ \\\\mathsf{elim}(w,h):C(w) } In extensional type theories, W-types (resp. M-types) can be defined up to isomorphism as initial algebras (resp. final coalgebras) for polynomial functors. In this case, the property of initiality (res. finality) corresponds directly to the appropriate induction principle. In intensional type theories with the univalence axiom, this correspondence holds up to homotopy (propositional equality). M-types are dual to W-types, they represent coinductive (potentially infinite) data such as streams. M-types can be derived from W-types. = Mutually inductive definitions = This technique allows some definitions of multiple types that depend on each other. For example, defining two parity predicates on natural numbers using two mutually inductive types in Coq: Inductive even : nat -> Prop :=  zero_is_even : even O  S_of_odd_is_even : (forall n:nat, odd n -> even (S n)) with odd : nat -> Prop :=  S_of_even_is_odd : (forall n:nat, even n -> odd (S n)). = Induction- recursion = Induction-recursion started as a study into the limits of ITT. Once found, the limits were turned into rules that allowed defining new inductive types. These types could depend upon a function and the function on the type, as long as both were defined simultaneously. Universe types can be defined using induction-recursion. = Induction-induction = Induction- induction allows definition of a type and a family of types at the same time. So, a type and a family of types B : A \\\\to Type. = Higher inductive types = This is a current research area in Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT). HoTT differs from ITT by its identity type (equality). Higher inductive types not only define a new type with constants and functions that create elements of the type, but also new instances of the identity type that relate them. A simple example is the type, which is defined with two constructors, a basepoint; : and a loop; : The existence of a new constructor for the identity type makes a higher inductive type.

He was a New York Inspector of State Prisons from 1876 to 1877. Life He was born on November 12, 1836 in Mount Holly, Vermont to Parmelia and Rufus Crowley. The family moved in 1841 to Yorkshire, New York, and in 1848 to Randolph, New York. He was admitted to the bar in 1861. He was a Justice of the Peace in Randolph in 1861, 1866 and 1872. He fought in the American Civil War. He enrolled first on August 17, 1861, as a private, and finished the war as a captain. He was wounded in the Battle of Seven Pines and in the Battle of Gettysburg, and discharged for disability on November 6, 1863. On September 3, 1861, he married Jane Hobert Mussey (b. 1835), and their children were Frederick Bowen Crowley (b. 1865) and Mary G. Crowley (b. 1872). In 1867, he was appointed a Commissioner to inquire into and ascertain what damages had been done to the lands embraced in the Cattaraugus Reservation, Allegany Indian Reservation and Oil Springs Reservation by trespassers, and submitted his report to the New York State Senate in 1868. He was Supervisor of the Town of Randolph in 1868 and 1869. From 1869 to 1871, he was Collector of Internal Revenue for the 31st District of New York. He was a Trustee of the Village of Randolph in 1874. In 1875, he was elected on the Democratic ticket an Inspector of State Prisons, and was in office from January 1876 to February 1877. The office was abolished by a constitutional amendment in 1876, and the three last Inspectors of State Prisons - George Wagener, Crowley and Robert H. Anderson - left office upon the appointment of Louis D. Pilsbury as Superintendent of State Prisons. On October 14, 1893, he was appointed Deputy New York State Superintendent of Banks taking over the duties of William F. Creed.

He was a contemporary of Saint Remigius, bishop of Rheims, and according to The Golden Legend, was married to Remigius' niece. Legend Because the diocese of Rheims was too large, Remigius had decided to create a separate diocese centered at Laon, and chose Genebald to be Laon’s first bishop. A married clerk, Genebald left his wife to become bishop around 499 AD. However, according to Canon Flodoard’s 10th-century account, Flodoardi Historiae Remensis Ecclesiae, and repeated by The Golden Legend,Christian Cochini, Apostolic Origins of Priestly Celibacy (Ignatius Press, 1990), 111. Genebald, after he became bishop, slept with his wife, who became pregnant with a boy. Genebald asked that his son be named Latro (“Thief”),In French, Latron or Larron. “because he had engendered it by theft.” So that it would not appear that his wife had borne a child out of wedlock, Genebald had her visit him again. Again they slept together, and this time his wife became pregnant with a girl, whom they named Vulpecula (“she-fox”).In French, Volpille. Confessing his sins to Remigius, Genebald offered to leave his diocese. However, Remigius comforted Genebald and received his confession, and gave Genebald penance. Remigius had him shut in a small cell near the church of St. Julian for seven years. Remigius fed Genebald on only bread and water during this time, and took over Genebald’s duties as bishop of Laon. According to The Golden Legend, an angel came to Genebald after the end of the seven- year term and gave Genebald permission to leave the cell. Genebald could not open the door as it had been sealed from the outside; however, according to the Legend, the angel opened the door after declaring: “Know thou that the door of heaven is opened to thee; I shall open this door without breaking of the seal which Saint Remigius hath sealed.” However, Genebald still wanted Remigius’ permission to leave the cell. The angel brought Remigius to him, and the bishop of Rheims reinstated Genebald as bishop of Laon. According to Christian Cochini, “this legendary narrative probably has a kernel of truth.” Reinstated as bishop, Genebald is said to have remained chaste for the rest of his life. After his death, his son Latro succeeded him as bishop of Laon. Latro was also venerated as a saint.

It is a crawling-like type of movement accomplished by protrusion of cytoplasm of the cell involving the formation of pseudopodia (\\"false-feet\\") and posterior uropods. One or more pseudopodia may be produced at a time depending on the organism, but all amoeboid movement is characterized by the movement of organisms with an amorphous form that possess no set motility structures. Movement occurs when the cytoplasm slides and forms a pseudopodium in front to pull the cell forward. This type of movement has been linked to changes in action potential, though the exact mechanism is still unknown. Some examples of organisms that exhibit this type of locomotion are amoebae (such as Amoeba proteus and Naegleria gruberi,) and slime molds, as well as some cells in humans such as leukocytes. Sarcomas, or cancers arising from connective tissue cells, are particularly adept at amoeboid movement, thus leading to their high rate of metastasis. While several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanism of amoeboid movement, the exact mechanism is still unknown. R D Allen, and N S Allen. \\"Cytoplasmic Streaming in Amoeboid Movement\\" http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.bb.07.060178.002345  Molecular mechanism of cell motion  Sol-gel theory = The protoplasm of an amoeba is made up of an outer layer termed the ectoplasm which surrounds an inner portion called the endoplasm. The ectoplasm consists of a gelatinous semisolid called plasma gel whereas the endoplasm is made up of a less viscous fluid called plasma sol. The ectoplasm owes its highly viscous state, in part, to the cross-linking actomyosin complex. Locomotion of an amoeba is thought to occur due to the sol-gel conversion of the protoplasm within its cell. 'Sol- gel conversion describes the contraction and relaxation events which are enforced by osmotic pressure and other ionic charges.' For example, when an amoeba moves, it extends a gelatinous, cytosolic pseudopodium, which then results in the more fluid cytosol (plasma sol) flowing after the gelatinous portion (plasma gel) where it congeals at the end of the pseudopodium. This results in the extension of this appendage. On the opposite (posterior) end of the cell, plasma gel is then converted to plasma sol and streamed toward the advancing pseudopodium. As long as the cell has a way to grapple the substratum, repetition of this process guides the cell forward. Inside the amoeba, there are proteins that can be activated to convert the gel into the more liquid sol state. Cytoplasm consist largely of actin and actin is regulated by actin binding proteins. Actin binding proteins are in turn regulated by calcium ions; hence, calcium ions are very important in the sol- gel conversion process. = Amoeboid movement modalities = Actin-driven motility  Based on some mathematical models, recent studies hypothesize a novel biological model for collective biomechanical and molecular mechanisms of cellular motion. It is proposed that microdomains weave the texture of cytoskeleton and their interactions mark the location for formation of new adhesion sites. According to this model, microdomain signaling dynamics organize the cytoskeleton and its interaction with the substratum. As microdomains trigger and maintain active polymerization of actin filaments, their propagation and zigzagging motion on the membrane generate a highly interlinked network of curved or linear filaments oriented at a wide spectrum of angles to the cell boundary. It has also been proposed that microdomain interaction marks the formation of new focal adhesion sites at the cell periphery. The interaction of myosin with the actin network then generates membrane retraction/ruffling, retrograde flow, and contractile forces for forward motion. Finally, continuous application of stress on the old focal adhesion sites could result in the calcium-induced activation of calpain, and consequently the detachment of focal adhesions which completes the cycle. In addition to actin polymerization, microtubules may also play an important role in cell migration where the formation of lamellipodia is involved. One experiment showed that although microtubules are not required for actin polymerization to create lamellipodial extensions, they are needed in order to afford cellular movement.Two common modes of amoeboid motility  Bleb- driven motility  Another such proposed mechanism, the 'bleb-driven amoeboid locomotion' mechanism, suggests that the cell cortex actomyosin contracts to increase hydrostatic pressure inside the cell. Blebbing occurs in amoeboid cells when there is a roughly spherical protrusion in the cell membrane characterized by detachment from the actomyosin cortex. This mode of amoeboid movement requires that myosin II play a role in generating the hydrostatic pressure that causes the bleb to extend. This is different from actin-driven locomotion where the protrusion created is by the actin polymerizing while remaining attached to the actomyosin cortex and physically pushing against the cell's barrier. During the bleb-driven amoeboid movement, the cytoplasmic sol-gel state is regulated. Blebbing can also be a sign of when a cell is undergoing apoptosis. It has also been observed that the blebs formed by motile cells undergo a roughly uniform life cycle that lasts approximately one minute. This includes a phase involving the initial outward expansion where the membrane breaks away from the membranous cytoskeleton. This is then followed by a short static phase where the hydrostatic pressure that has built up is just enough to maintain the size of the bleb. Following this is the last phase characterized by the bleb slowly retracting and the membrane being reintroduced to the cytoskeleton infrastructure. Cells may undergo fast transitions between blebbing and lamellipodium-based motility as a means of migration. However, the rate at which these transitions are made is still unknown. Tumor cells may also exhibit rapid transitions between amoeboid motility and mesenchymal motility, another form of cellular movement. = Related movement mechanisms = Dictyostelium cells and neutrophils can also swim, using a similar mechanism as for crawling. Another unicellular form of movement shown in Euglena is known as metaboly. The basis of sol gel theory is interconversion of sol and gel.

It has been designated as a grade I listed building. There is a Norman doorway however the rest of the church dates from around 1290. The north aisle was built in the late 15th century. The three-stage tower, which has been dated to around 1397, contains a bell dating from 1777 and made by William Bilbie of the Bilbie family. The church is best known for its unusual carvings on some of its pew ends and in particular the three that make up an allegorical cartoon thought to depict an avaricious Abbot of Glastonbury in the guise of a fox. The pulpit is from the 17th century. Architecture The Parish Church of St Michael at Brent Knoll had its origins in the eleventh century, with further construction work taking place in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, with a restoration in the nineteenth century. It is built of coursed and squared rubble stone, with lead sheeting on the roofs apart from the chancel roof, which is slated. There are cruciform finials on the gable ends. The church is built mostly in the Perpendicular style, the plan being the nave, the chancel, the north aisle, the fourteenth century south porch and the south transept, now used as a vestry. The fourteenth century tower is at the west end and has three stages with set-back buttresses. It is topped by a parapet with pinnacles, and gargoyles to shed the water. The Norman doorway in the south porch has chevron decorations. The fifteenth century nave has a wagon roof, and fittings inside the church include an eleventh century font, a pulpit dated 1637, a Jacobean coffin-stool and chair, and a Medieval parish chest. The interior of the church is particularly noted for the bench ends of the pews which are elaborately carved and date to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The church is used as the venue for a series of musical and arts events each summer.

Rugby career Evans first played club rugby for his hometown club of Ammanford,Ammanford RFC history before switching to first class Welsh club Llanelli. It was while representing Llanelli that Evans was first selected to play for Wales, in the second game of the 1896 Home Nations Championship. Evans came into a pack along with four other new caps, a reaction by the Welsh selectors to the terrible defeat by England in the previous game. The new players were chosen for their rough physical style of play, and were dubbed 'Rhondda forwards' after the tough coal playing men from that area. The initial decision worked, with Wales winning 6-0 against Scotland at the Cardiff Arms Park. Evans was reselected for the third and final game of the Championship, an away game to Ireland. This time the new forward strategy was not successful with the Irish kick-and-rush tactics, and Wales lost 4-8. Despite the loss Evans was re-selected for the only game Wales played in the 1897 Home Nations Championship. The match saw Wales beat England by a record amount, but due to the Gould affair, Wales left the International Rugby Board, and could not play in any further international games.

Education  Clark attended University of Bordeaux in Europe through the University of California's Education Abroad Program. Clarke earned a Bachelor's degree and a teaching credential from UCLA.  Career  Clark served as a Planning Commissioner. With the death of councilman Robert DeCocker in October 1990, a special election was held in Rosemead, California. In March 1991, Clark won the election and became a member of the city council for Rosemead, California, serving the remaining term until April 1992. Clark defeated Joe Vasquez and Jean DeCocker. Joe Vasquez lost by 26 votes. Having previously served six terms, Clark now serves on the Rosemead city council. When she was re-elected mayor in 2009, she stated: \\"I'll look at each project that comes before us individually,\\" she said. \\"The council sets policy... We hire people to implement our visions. I will hire people that have vision, that have the expertise and we will look at what they are recommending, but I am not a micromanager.\\" \\"My vision is to keep Rosemead a bedroom community, with places to shop and eat and enjoy.\\" http://www.rosemead-info.4t.com/ =Controversy= In March 2005, Rosemead's city council election became quite contentious due to citywide anti-Wal-Mart sentiment. Clark, who supported the addition of a Wal-Mart to the city, came in third in the election behind challengers John Tran and John Nunez. While serving on Rosemead's city council in May 2008, Clark supported the censure of a city councilman who was accused of sexually harassing a former city employee. The suit brought by the former employee was settled out of court for $330,000 - to be paid by the City of Rosemead's liability insurance. Clark, who opposed any settlement that would find the City of Rosemead liable, criticized the statement saying, \\"I think it's just outrageous what he did, and that there are no consequences for him.\\" Although the councilman had written a letter of apology to all city employees except city council members, Clark stated that \\"he should do the honorable thing and resign.\\" She also stated \\"This letter does not apologize for anything\\" and said she believed that the letter was a \\"ploy\\" in preparation for the 2009 election. In the 2009 election, the accused councilman was defeated, losing his council seat.  Personal life  Clark is the great-granddaughter of former United States President Rutherford B. Hayes.

The Ceramic Bulletin is produced every two years by the university and it features news of activities including exhibitions, new acquisitions, research, awards and grants. Ceramic Collection The main collection was formed between 1920–1936 and since 1974 there has again been an active acquisitions policy and there is now a major collection of contemporary ceramics. The collection also includes a fine body of nineteenth century slipware and examples of work from many periods, from archaeological specimens to Welsh porcelain of Nantgarw and Swansea. In 1986 the display area was extended and a purpose built gallery was created on the ground floor of Aberystwyth Arts Centre. The principal parts of the collection are permanently on display in the back gallery while the front gallery is used for changing displays and exhibitions from the permanent collection and touring exhibitions. The collections have been supported in recent years by funding from Arts Council of Wales, the Council of Museums in Wales, by loans of work by the Crafts Council and by purchase grant funding from the Victoria and Albert Purchase Grant Fund and the Art Fund.

Two were built before the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia in March 1939 and seized the rest of the guns and kept it in production for their own use, eventually building a total of 60 guns for themselves. They saw action in Operation Barbarossa, the Siege of Odessa, Siege of Leningrad and the Siege of Sevastopol and were used on coast defence duties. Development and design It was designed by Škoda as a dual-purpose heavy field and coast defence gun in the late 1930s for Turkey with the designation of K52. Only two had been delivered before the rest of the production run was appropriated by the Heer upon the occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939.Gander and Chamberlain, p. 206 Unlike the German practice of sliding block breeches that required a metallic cartridge case to seal the gun's chamber against combustion gases, Škoda preferred to use an interrupted screw breech with a de Bange obdurator to seal the chamber. This lowered the rate of fire, but had the great economic advantage of allowing bagged propellant charges that didn't use scarce brass or steel cartridge case when those metals were in short supply. The other unusual feature of the gun was that it used a monobloc auto-frettaged barrel. This was a single piece of steel that was radially expanded under hydraulic pressure. This had the advantage of placing the steel of the barrel under compression, which helped it resist the stresses of firing and was simpler and faster to build since the barrel didn't require assembly as with more traditional construction techniques.Hogg, p. 100 The box trail carriage revolved on a turntable that sat on a ball race on the firing platform and was capable of 360° traverse. The end of the carriage rested on rollers which rested on a metal track or rail. For transport the K 39 broke down into three loads, the barrel, the carriage and the firing platform with the turntable. Each of these was carried on a trailer with pneumatic tires. Emplacing the gun took six to eight hours, mainly to dig in and anchor the firing platform.Hogg, p. 100 The story of the gun's development by the Germans is contradictory in the available sources. Hogg claims that the K 39/40 had only slight changes made, but that the K 39/41 added a muzzle brake to control recoil.Hogg, p. 100 Gander and Chamberlain say that the K 39/40 and K 39/41 both had muzzle brakes with better performance than the original K 39 and that the K 39/41 was introduced to simplify production. Sixty were built for the Germans. During the war, nine of these guns were sold to Sweden, where they were used to equip three heavy mobile coastal batteries. The guns were part of the Swedish war organization until 1982, although training on them ceased in 1972. =Ammunition= Every shell used by the K 39 weighed . The original Czech 21 cm Gr 39 (t) high- explosive shell had both nose and base fuzes and a filling of of TNT. The German equivalent, the 21 cm Gr 40, lacked the base fuze, had a copper driving band well forward on the shell and was fitted with a thin metal casing behind the driving band filled with a graphite mixture intended as a bore lubricant and to reduce wear. The 21 cm Gr 39 Be was a Czech-designed anti-concrete shell fitted with a base fuze, a ballistic cap and the additive sleeve. It was filled with of TNT. There was also an armor-piercing, base-fuzed shell, the 21 cm Pzgr 39 of which little is known other than it had a filling of of a PETN/wax mixture.Hogg, p. 100 The K 39 used a three-part bagged charge that weighed a total of . The K 39/41 used a bagged charge with a total weight of The base charge (Kleine Ladung) weighed and had an igniter stitched to its base. The two increments (Vorkart) were lightly stitched together and enclosed in another bag tied at the top and with another igniter stitched to the base. The medium charge (Mittlere Ladung) consisted of the base charge and increment 2 while the full charge (Grosse Ladung) consisted of the base charge and both increments. The increments were loaded before the base charge.Hogg, pp. 100-101 Operational history The K 39 and its variants served as mobile artillery only with Artillery Battalions (Artillerie-Abteilungen) 767 and 768, each battalion being organized with 3 batteries, each with two guns. Both battalions were raised in April—May 1940, but it is unknown if either participated in the Battle of France.

It was distributed by Columbia Pictures Television through Operation Prime Time. Gossett's performance earned him a nomination for an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award. Plot The film begins by depicting Sadat's involvement with violent anti-British insurgents. Eventually he becomes a follower of Gamal Abdel Nasser (John Rhys-Davies) as the latter begins his ascent to political supremacy in Egypt. As Egypt becomes more of a regional power led by Nasser, Sadat suffers the strain of being Nasser's yes man, while clashing with him. Nasser enjoys widespread popularity once he nationalizes the Suez Canal, but suffers a fatal downfall in the wake of Egypt's crushing defeat in the Six-Day War. Eventually succeeding Nasser, Sadat finds himself beholden to the Soviets for military assistance. The Soviets know the Egyptians are determined to go to war with Israel and reclaim the Sinai, but doubt that Egypt's military can cross the Suez without their help. Determined to make the Egyptians masters of their own nation, Sadat forgoes Soviet assistance (and their influence). In October 1973, Egypt and Syria launch a two-front attack on Israel. Egypt's planning proves immensely successful at the outset, building on a well-executed amphibious crossing of the Suez. Egyptian air defense units hold off Israel's Air Force, depriving soldiers on the ground of air support. The assault founders when an Israeli tank unit led by Ariel Sharon holds its own without air support. Sadat also suffers the loss of a relative shot down during the war. Ultimately, Sadat realizes the futility of war, and seeks a peaceful dialog with Israel, leading up to his meetings with Menachem Begin (Barry Morse). While the resulting Israeli- Egyptian peace treaty normalizes relations between Egypt and the west, in the midst of the Israeli occupation of Palestine greatly alienates Sadat from the rest of the Arab world. On October 6, 1981, Sadat is assassinated as he and several foreign dignitaries review a military procession marking the 1973 crossing of the Suez.

The Egyptian Ministry of Culture announced a ban on all films and television programs distributed by Columbia Pictures, and Egypt's artists' and film unions sued Columbia Pictures and the film's director, writer, and producers. The lawsuit was dismissed by an Egyptian court for lack of jurisdiction because the film's \\"distortions\\" and \\"slanders\\" occurred outside Egypt. Director Michaels said that the Egyptian government deserved the 1984 \\"overreaction award\\" for its handling of the miniseries.https://twitter.com/RetroNewsNow/status/1117629594251735040 References External links  * * The full translated movie https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwwYARiWon0 Category:1983 television films Category:1983 films Category:1980s biographical films Category:1980s drama films Category:English-language films Category:Operation Prime Time Category:Films scored by Charles Bernstein Category:Television series by Sony Pictures Television Category:Works about Anwar Sadat Category:Television shows set in Egypt Category:Cultural depictions of Anwar Sadat Category:Cultural depictions of Golda Meir Category:Cultural depictions of Jimmy Carter Category:Cultural depictions of Leonid Brezhnev Category:Cultural depictions of Gamal Abdel Nasser Category:Cultural depictions of Menachem Begin ","title":"Sadat (miniseries)"},{"id":"22778536","text":"Robinson is a former settlement in Fresno and Kings Counties, California.

The MV Tourist No. 2 is a former car ferry with a unique Pacific Northwest history. Tourist No. 2 is a 1924 wooden-hulled car ferry that has served passengers all over the Pacific Northwest. Originally, it took passengers across the Columbia River, with a dock in Astoria, Oregon. Currently, it is undergoing restoration in Astoria. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.Added to NRHP on April 15th, 1997, as the Tourist II  History  With the exception of the Second World War, from 1924 to 1966, MV Tourist No. 2 was in service on the Astoria–Megler Ferry route on the Columbia River. Following the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, the US Army purchased the vessel as the FB or JMP 535 to lay mines at the mouth of the river. At the end of the war, it returned to ferry service on the Columbia. The ferry was moved from Astoria, Oregon to Pierce County, Washington in 1967 and renamed the Islander of Pierce County. It worked on Puget Sound for many years, but eventually its wooden-hull design was overshadowed by vessels with more modern steel-hull designs. In 1996, new private owners Argosy Cruises bought the vessel and renamed it to Kirkland. They refurbished it, adding two full-service bars, a galley, and 12-foot floor-to-ceiling windows, making the main deck unique among vessels in the Northwest. The exterior styling, deck plan, and interior and general arrangement were provided by designer Jonathan Quinn Barnett of Seattle. The vessel is listed on the Washington Historic Register and the National Register of Historic Places. Early morning, August 28, 2010. the vessel caught fire while docked at its Kirkland, Washington pier. The fire was confined to the engine room. Firefighters were quoted as saying everything below deck was \\"toast\\". The Boat was moved from Lake Washington during the morning of August 31, 2010 - by the Tug \\"Dixie\\"—part of the Fremont Tug Company. The vessel was sold to Christian Lint in 2010 after Argosy Cruise Lines concluded that it was not economical to repair the fire damage. Lint moored the vessel in Bremerton and used it for special events. In 2016, Lint sold the vessel to the Astoria Ferry Group, and returned it to Astoria on August 1. As of 2019, the vessel is undergoing restoration.

Music career Amdursky began his career in Israel with the band \\"Taarovet Escot\\", which also included Amir \\"Jango\\" Rusianu and Yirmi Kaplan. Together they released one album in 1991. The band soon broke up, and all of its members pursued solo careers. His first eponymous solo album was released in 1994. He wrote and composed most of the songs on it. In it he played guitar, keyboards, percussion, bass, harmonica, and trumpet, and collaborated with Karni Postel, Vered Klepter, Jonnie Shualy, as well as his bandmates from Taarovet Escot. It yielded the hits Yekirati (My Darling\\")and Ahava Khadasha (New Love). The album was re-mastered and re-released with bonus tracks in 2008. His second album, also eponymous, was released in 1996. On it he experimented with more keyboard-oriented arrangements and longer tracks. The songs Hashamayim Hakkhulim (The Blue Sky) and Hu He'emin La (He Believed Her) became hits. In 1999 Amdursky published his album Menoim Shketim (Silent Engines) with the hit songs 15 minutes and Khalom Kehe, which featured a recorded monologue of the late musician Inbal Perlmuter. The album went gold. It also included a duo with Eviatar Banai in the closing song Ahava... (Love...). During the mid-1990s, Amdursky moved to the United States to pursue a DJ and dance music production career. He teamed up with Friburn & Urik to produce a remix for their debut single \\"You Got My Love\\" on Sub Culture Records.With production partner Omri Anghel, he formed \\"Hard Attack.\\" The duo released their first single on the Jellybean Recordings Label, \\"Set Me Free\\", which immediately climbed its way up to the top-20 Billboard Dance Music chart. From 1999 to 2002, Amdursky released a number of remixes and original tracks as a producer, in collaboration with Israeli producer Haim Laroz. Back in Israel, Amdursky released a live album in 2000, which documents a live show with a new electronic version to his earlier songs. In 2000 he was awarded the Israeli Singer of the Year award (the Tamuz Prize), and the Album of the Year award for Silent Engines. In 2005, he produced Kadima Akhora (Forth and Back) – a double cover album, which interprets 1980s Israeli songs with a touch of electronic music. Amdursky's self-released studio album Harei At (Thou Art), released in 2008, also went gold. It combined 11 new rock, pop, and jazz style songs, all dealing with love and partnerships. His next album Tsad Alef (Side A) was released in 2011, and included one song with lyrics by David Avidan, and collaborations with guest singers Tom Darom, Rona Kenan and Karni Postel. Amdursky also worked as the music producer on the movies Nina's Tragedies (2003), Ahava Columbianit (2004), and Lost Islands (2008). For the latter he received the Ophir Award. Personal life Amdursky's father, Benny Amdursky (1931–1994), was also a singer. Amdursky was married for 12 years to singer- songwriter Michal Amdursky, who came out with a solo album after her divorce from Amdursky. The divorce is the subject of some of the songs on her album, in which she sings of emerging finally from her ex-husband's shadow.

Retrieved from http://gslis.simmons.edu/podcasts/index.php?id=114 The guiding conceptual principle for the development of the World Heritage Memory Net is to construct a framework that allows users to easily see, explore, discover, and visually experience the 936 Heritage Sites first, and then dig in for more detailed and descriptive information about each Site, as graphically shown on the home page. It is directed by Ching-chih Chen, currently of Global Connection and Collaboration, a nonprofit and tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization; prior to July 2010, Chen directed this project for three years at Simmons College until she became Professor Emeritus. The goal of WHMNet is to provide an online library of material related to the 962 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and to provide universal access to a worldwide audience. WHMNet provides multimedia and multilingual content and retrieval, videos, timeline, map, as well as links to major resources, such as OCLC, Wikipedia, Internet Archive, Million Books, Google Scholar and Google Books. All of the collections are available in at least 6 official UN languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish. As of 2012, up to 103 languages are supported by WHMNet, as available. History Directed by Ching-chih Chen of the US nonprofit and tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization, Global Connection and Collaboration, Inc., and supported until August 2010 by the NSF/International Digital Library Program (IDLP) as a part of her Global Memory Net, WHMNet is the result of a multi-year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in November 2006 between the World Heritage Centre and Simmons College, Boston, Massachusetts, USA under the leadership of Chen, who was then information technology Professor at Simmons Graduate School of Library and Information Science. The WHMNet project, which began in July 2007, benefits greatly from Chen's GMNet, an online global image library and gateway to cultural, historical, and heritage images around the world, created with a multi-year grant from the International Digital Library Programme of the US National Science Foundation (NSF). WHMNet leverages GMNet's innovative integrated multimedia content retrieval system (i-M-C-S) with further system development. Chen became Professor Emeritus of Simmons College in June, 2010 and NSF grant ended in August 2010. Since September 2010 to the present, WHMNet has been supported by GlobalCC until its completion. The goal is to bring an immersive, seamless, multimedia experience in a multilingual website to citizens, researchers, scholars and students of the world.https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/326 World Heritage Memory Net is coming soon!

Deaf Heritage–A Narrative History of Deaf America, Silver Spring, MD: National Association of the Deaf, p. 266-270 and later known as Captioned Films and Videos and the Captioned Media Program, is a national nonprofit funded by the United States Department of Education under federal Public Law 85-905. It is currently administered by the National Association of the Deaf. The DCMP houses a national library of accessible educational media (e.g., DVDs, CD-ROMs, and streaming video) that is available to teachers and parents/guardians of K-12 students who are deaf, hard of hearing, blind, visually impaired, or deaf- blind. It also maintains a search gateway that allows users to selectively search across the DCMP clearinghouse of accessibility-related articles on deafness, blindness, accessibility, captioning, and description, including collaborator websites.  History  Lexington School for the Deaf Captioned Films for the Deaf, Inc. was established in 1950 in Hartford, Connecticut. Founders Edmund Boatner, superintendent of the American School for the Deaf, and Dr. Clarence O’Connor, superintendent of the Lexington School for the Deaf, organized the program as a private nonprofit corporation. In a few years, a library of thirty captioned theatrical films was acquired. Although the program was initially a success, more financial support was needed than could be provided by private funds. The possibility of government support was explored at length. Organizations, including the National Association of the Deaf, the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf, the Conference of Executives of American Schools for the Deaf, and the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf, lobbied Congress on behalf of the program. In 1958 the Captioned Films for the Deaf, Inc. became federal Public Law 85-905. The private corporation dissolved, and its entire collection of films was donated to the government. In July 1959 the requisite funding was made available, and in October of that year the new federally run Captioned Films for the Deaf (CFD) program opened its doors to the public. Although the initial purpose of the CFD was to provide subtitled Hollywood films to deaf people, Congress soon amended the original law to authorize the acquisition, captioning, and distribution of educational films. In 1984 CFD introduced videocassettes and subsequently became Captioned Films/Videos (CFV). Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, 16mm films were withdrawn from the collection in favor of the more widely used VHS format. Likewise, in the mid-to-late 1990s, DVD, interactive CD-ROM, and streaming media gradually took over as the formats of choice in many schools and homes across the country. To reflect this evolution, CFV was again rebranded as the Captioned Media Program (CMP). This change occurred simultaneously with an increased focus on accessible media for K-12 students and their teachers and parents. In 2006 the CMP began serving students with vision loss, and once again changed its name to the Described and Captioned Media Program. Along the way, the program established quality standards for captioned media, particularly that which is used in educational settings. The Captioning Key: Guidelines and Preferred Techniques (now known as the Captioning Key for Educational Media) is a manual designed to encourage high-quality captioning standards. Given its wide circulation and constant evolution, the Captioning Key remains an important component of the DCMP’s services today. DCMP service to students who are blind or visually impaired involves another essential accessibility tool: audio description. In October 2008 the DCMP also released its Description Key for Educational Media. Developed in partnership with the American Foundation for the Blind, the Description Key is a first-of-its-kind reference for description vendors. The DCMP also evaluates American captioning and description vendors according to these guidelines.

An award ceremony encouraged young film directors to participate in the festival. The purpose was to bring together independent filmmakers from the United States, France and other European countries. Their mission was to encourage deeper understanding and appreciation for contemporary, thought-provoking cinema by showcasing the work of innovative filmmakers. Feature films, short films and documentaries were presented in French, English and other European languages. Every French film was subtitled in English, and European films in English or French. Film directors, producers and screenwriters could join the discussions about their work with the public. In 1993 the Harvard Film Archive invited the organisation to co-produce the first American edition of Rencontres Cinématographiques franco-américaines d'Avignon. In 1994, the founder, Jérôme Henry Rudes, launched the Avignon/New York Film Festival at the Angelika Film Center in Manhattan. The festivals were held in June and November.

It is the third film version of the operetta, the third made by Warner Bros., and the second in full three-strip Technicolor. Although it was released in 1953, it was not made in widescreen; at that time Twentieth- Century Fox held the rights to Cinemascope, which was introduced that year in the film The Robe. Plot The original plot is more-or-less adhered to, with some significant alterations. Benny is depicted as a comic Bob Hope-like coward, but not as a sissy. El Khobar's alter ego is that of a mild-mannered (but not squeamish) Latin tutor and anthropologist, whom Birabeau (Ray Collins) hires to keep Margot (Kathryn Grayson) from flirting with his regiment. The conclusion to the film is slightly different, since El Khobar (Gordon MacRae) is not Birabeau's son here. After the final battle, the General's soldiers realize that El Khobar and the Riffs were actually on their side and helped in preventing an uprising. When one asks, \\"And where is El Khobar?\\", MacRae, as the professor, enters carrying El Khobar's clothes, and quietly announces \\"El Khobar is dead\\". Margot is grief-stricken, but Birabeau, suspecting the truth, mischievously says that they can all be grateful to \\"the ghost of El Khobar\\", winking as he says this. As soon as they are alone, MacRae begins to sing the song One Alone to Margot, making her realize that her boring Latin tutor and the dashing El Khobar are one and the same. She rushes into his arms.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=26588&category;=Full%20Synopsis One song not by Romberg, Gay Parisienne, written for the 1943 film version of the show, is retained for this film. Casting * Kathryn Grayson as Margot * Gordon MacRae as El Khobar/Paul Bonnard, the dashing outlaw leader * Steve Cochran as Captain Claud Fontaine, El Khobar's rival for Margot's affections * Raymond Massey as Sheik Youseff, the villain * Dick Wesson as Benjamin 'Benjy' Kidd * Allyn McLerie as Azuri * Ray Collins as General Birabeau, here depicted as Margot's father, rather than the hero's * Paul Picerni as Hassan * Frank DeKova as Mindar * William Conrad as Lachmed * Trevor Bardette as Neri * Mark Dana as Lt.

He was a principal partner at the law firm of Morvillo, Abramowitz, Grand, Iason, Anello, & Bohrer, P.C. He is the son of the late Cyrus Vance, former Secretary of State under President Jimmy Carter. Youth, family, and education Vance grew up in New York City. He is the son of Grace Elsie (Sloane) and Cyrus R. Vance, who served as Secretary of the Army under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and Deputy Secretary of Defense under President Johnson, then Secretary of State to President Jimmy Carter. Vance attended the Buckley and Groton Schools, and then went on to graduate from Yale University. He then earned his Juris Doctor from Georgetown University Law Center in 1982. While in law school, he planned campaign trips for Colorado Senator Gary Hart. He moved to Seattle, Washington in 1989, and back to New York City in 2005. He and his wife, printer and photographer Peggy McDonnell, were married in 1984 and have two children. Legal career Upon graduating from Georgetown, Vance joined the Manhattan District Attorney’s office as an Assistant District Attorney, where he supervised grand jury investigations and prosecuted cases involving murder, organized crime, career criminals, political corruption, international art fraud, and white-collar crime. In 1988, Vance moved to Seattle because, according to Vance, he wanted to build a name for himself independent of his father's influence. In 1995, Vance co-founded McNaul Ebel Nawrot Helgren & Vance. During this time, Vance taught trial advocacy as an adjunct professor at Seattle University School of Law. In 2004, Vance returned to New York, where he joined Morvillo, Abramowitz, Grand, Iason, Anello & Bohrer, P.C. as a principal. Vance is admitted to the bar in New York State, Washington state, and Washington, D.C., and to practice before the United States Supreme Court, the U.S. District Courts for the Southern District of New York and Western and Eastern Districts of Washington, and the U.S. Second and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals.

He has served on sentencing commissions in two states, including New York, where he served on the Governor's Sentencing Commission, which helped overhaul New York’s Rockefeller drug laws. Vance also served, by appointment of the Governor of New York, as a member of the New York State Appellate Division, First Department, Judicial Screening Panel which makes recommendations on judicial appointments. Vance is a member of the Criminal Justice Council of the New York City Bar Association, the Federal Bar Council, and the New York Council of Defense Lawyers. He is a member of the Board of Directors of the Fund for Modern Courts, the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, and the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation. Cyrus Vance Sr., Vance's father died of Alzheimer's Disease in 2002. 2009 Manhattan District Attorney election Vance campaign in May 2009 In 2008, Vance announced his intention to seek the District Attorney’s office only if current District Attorney Robert Morgenthau decided to retire. On March 9, 2009, ten days after Morgenthau made his decision to retire public, Vance officially announced his candidacy for the office. In an April 8, 2009 appearance on Charlie Rose, Morgenthau said of Vance, “I think Vance is by far the best qualified. Good lawyer, fair.” Morgenthau officially endorsed Vance on June 25. Other Democrats who endorsed Vance included former Mayor David Dinkins, Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum, Gloria Steinem, Caroline Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Congresswoman Nydia Velázquez, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, and Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld of The Innocence Project. The New York Times, New York Daily News, New York Post, and New York Amsterdam News also endorsed Vance. Vance stated that as Manhattan District Attorney, he would develop a program of “Community Based Justice”, in which teams of prosecutors would be aligned to specific precincts and communities so as to develop a working relationship with community members, police officers, and local organizations. According to Vance, the Community Based Justice Program would make crime reduction a central measure of performance. Vance has also proposed a plan designed to reduce the year-long case backlog in the New York Criminal Court where the overwhelming majority of criminal cases are brought. In addition to processing cases, Vance has expressed his commitment to establishing a conviction integrity panel to carefully review allegations of wrongful conviction and promoting alternatives to incarceration that do not compromise public safety. Vance states that he has always been opposed to the death penalty. Vance emerged victorious after facing former judge and 2005 D.A. candidate Leslie Crocker Snyder, and Richard Aborn, another former Assistant District Attorney and gun control advocate, in the September 15, 2009 Democratic primary. The victory ensured that Vance would become only the fourth person to run the office since 1941, given the traditional absence during Morgenthau's tenure of a Republican backed opponent. On November 3, 2009, Vance won the general election with a 91 percent share of the votes cast. Manhattan District Attorney Vance was sworn into office as the Manhattan District Attorney on January 1, 2010. Within a few months, he established or consolidated numerous new bureaus and units in an effort to modernize the District Attorney's Office. Vance's administration established a Conviction Integrity Program, Crime Strategies Unit, Cybercrime and Identity Theft Bureau, Forensic Sciences/ Cold Case Unit, Hate Crimes Unit, Public Integrity Unit, Special Victims Bureau, and Vehicular Crimes Unit. Vance speaks at a February 2011 press conference =Notable cases= In 2011, a New York prosecutor from Vance's office argued on behalf of billionaire and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, to New York Supreme Court Judge Ruth Pickholtz, asking for Epstein's sex offender status to be reduced. The reasoning was that Epstein had not been indicted and his underage victims had failed to cooperate in the case. The judge, however, denied the petition, and expressed bewilderment that a New York prosecutor would make such a request on behalf of a serial sex offender accused of molesting multiple girls: \\"I have to tell you, I’m a little overwhelmed because I have never seen a prosecutor’s office do anything like this. I have done so many [sex offender registration hearings] much less troubling than this one where the [prosecutor] would never make a downward argument like this,\\". Jennifer Gaffney, then deputy chief of Cyrus Vance Jr.’s sex-crimes unit, stated at the hearing that, “There is only an indictment for one victim. If an offender is not indicted for an offense, it is strong evidence that the offense did not occur.”. Pickholz rejected Gaffney’s arguments and gave Epstein the highest sex-offender status – Level 3. While Vance denies having been aware of the hearing until years later, some law enforcement sources find it unlikely that he was unaware his office was handling a sex-offender case involving a Manhattan mogul with close ties to Democrats. In 2019, Epstein was arrested and charged with sex trafficking. Vance's recent successes include the sentencing of a serial rapist to 428 years to life in prison; sentencing of a man to 23 years to life in prison for a domestic violence murder; indictments against 26 individuals living in Manhattan who possessed graphic images of child sexual assault; the sentencing of a man to at least 15 years in prison for a 2000 rape; a sentencing of a man to 25 to life in prison for a 1997 home invasion and murder; an indictment against another man for a 1986 rape and murder; and the guilty plea of a man for attacking a woman in the restroom of a bar in Hell's Kitchen. Vance has also won convictions in an October 2009 drunk-driving incident that killed 11-year-old Leandra Rosado, resulting in the creation of Leandra's Law; and a case of two men in a 2005 murder-for-hire plot. In January 2011, the District Attorney's Forensic Sciences/ Cold Case Unit announced an indictment against noted serial killer Rodney Alcala for two Manhattan homicides in the 1970s. Vance at June 2011 press conference on child assault Vance's newly created Major Economic Crimes Bureau has won convictions in the $120 million-dollar art fraud prosecution of the Salander-O'Reilly Gallery, the gallery's president Lawrence Salander and director Leigh Morse, in which Robert De Niro was one of the principal witnesses for the prosecution; a $100 million-dollar securities fraud scheme in which Yale University was one of the victims; a $100 million-dollar mortgage fraud case; and a $7 million-dollar Ponzi scheme. The District Attorney's Office in June 2011 announced indictments in a conspiracy involving 11 corporations who evaded U.S. economic sanctions on Iran by funneling tens of millions of dollars through Manhattan banks. To date, Vance's administration has brought hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements to New York City. Cyrus Vance prosecuted programmer Sergey Aleynikov for duplicating computer code from Goldman Sachs, following the reversal of his federal conviction by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The state case found Aleynikov guilty. However, on July 6, 2015, a New York State Supreme Court justice overturned that decision, but an appellate court reinstated the jury's guilty verdict on January 24, 2017. 148 AD3d 77 [1st Dept 2017], affirmed, 31 NY3d 383 [2018]. In 2020, a New York City police officer was filmed punching and pepper-spraying a homeless man in the face. According to the police officer, he sustained swelling to his hand after the man allegedly kicked him while handcuffed to the platform. Vance's office has charged the homeless man with felony assault, punishable by up to seven years in prison. The Legal Aid society notes that the police originally charged the man with lesser crimes, but Vance's office chose to upgrade the charges: \\"It's shocking that the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, despite seeing this video, chose to bump up the charges against our client. We are calling on them to dismiss these charges immediately in the interest of justice.\\" Following scrutiny and criticism after footage was released to the public, Vance's office dropped some of the charges, but Legal Aid calls for the other charges to also be dropped (resisting arrest, obstruction, taking up an extra seat on the train), as well as for the officers to be sanctioned =Abacus Federal Savings Bank case= In 2009, Abacus Federal Savings Bank, a small Chinese-American family-run bank in New York City's Chinatown, self- reported a mortgage fraud committed by an ex-employee to its regulators. It led Cyrus Vance's office to later accuse the bank itself of mortgage fraud. In an unusual move characterized by critics as an effort at grandstanding, Vance's office orchestrated a parade of ex-employees of the bank in a chain, handcuffed to each other, in front of reporters.\\"After the Crash, Big Banks Got Bailouts. Abacus Faced Charges.\\", September 12, 2016. After Vance spent five years and $10 million prosecuting the bank for larceny, the bank and its employees were found not guilty on all 80 charges. The bank was the only New York bank so charged during the Great Recession, although Vance said that Citibank, among others, had behaved badly. The episode was covered in a feature-length documentary by Steve James, Abacus: Small Enough to Jail, which characterized Vance as throwing the bank's owners under the bus in an effort to appear tough on white-collar crime. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2016, was broadcast on PBS Frontline in 2017, and was nominated for an Oscar. \\"Abacus: Small Enough to Jail\\", Retrieved September 13, 2017. =Motor vehicle prosecution= Transportation advocates have criticized Vance's office for what they see as a history of failing to fully prosecute motor vehicle offenses that result in death or serious injury to pedestrians and cyclists. In July 2010, no charges were filed when an MTA tow truck struck and killed a seven-year-old boy standing on the sidewalk. In October 2010, Vance declined to press charges in the dooring death of Marcus Ewing, on the rationale that, because the engine was not running and because the person who opened the door into Ewing's path did not have the keys in his possession, that person could not be prosecuted as a driver. In August 2013, a cab driver hopped a curb, injuring several pedestrians and severing the leg of a British tourist. Despite a history of driving offenses, and admitting that he intentionally hit the gas before entering the sidewalk, the driver was able to regain his cab license, and after a two-month investigation, no charges were filed. In October 2014, Vance's office offered a plea to a driver accused of intentionally striking a cyclist with his car. The deal reduced charges of third-degree assault, punishable by up to a year in jail, to leaving the scene of an accident with property damage. The motorist paid a $250 fine. The lack of prosecutorial aggressiveness from Vance's office, in spite of recently passed vulnerable user laws and Vance's own initiatives has led to widespread media commentary on whether New York City cyclists can reasonably expect protection from the justice system. Additionally, during an investigation into faded white flags flown over the Brooklyn Bridge in July 2014, Vance's office subpoenaed a farcical Twitter account, purporting to be the bicycle industry lobby, which had jokingly taken responsibility for the flag swap. The flags were later revealed to be the work of German artists. =Dominique Strauss- Kahn case= Vance initially came under criticism by the media for ultimately dismissing charges in the Dominique Strauss-Kahn sexual assault case, after the French head of the International Monetary Fund was arrested, based on accusations by a hotel maid at the Sofitel hotel who said he had forced her to perform oral sex when she came to clean his room. Kahn admitted the encounter had taken place, but maintained the sex was consensual. However, Vance was praised by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former Mayor Ed Koch, former Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, and other prominent litigators and government officials for adhering to prosecutorial protocol and acting \\"with integrity\\". Vance has also been applauded in editorials by the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and the New York Daily News for making a \\"tough but fair and just call\\" in \\"an exceptional case\\" in which a woman made a \\"credible\\" accusation against a very powerful man. The Wall Street Journal wrote: \\"DSK got neither more nor less than he deserved—something for which he can blame, and thank, Cy Vance and America's justice system.\\" He dropped all charges against the defendant on August 11, stating that he could not prove Kahn's guilt beyond reasonable doubt due to questions about the credibility of the accuser Nafissatou Diallo. =Paul Manafort= On March 13, 2019 Vance filed 16 indictments charging mortgage fraud against Paul Manafort, former chairman of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Vance said the charges stemmed from an investigation launched in March 2017. These charges were subsequently dismissed by a judge. =Political contributions and non- prosecutions= From August 2017, allegations appeared across various news media outlets concerning Vance's associations, and certain contributions made to his office in relation to past cases. Under scrutiny are the Manhattan DA's handling of allegations of sexual assault against film producer Harvey Weinstein,Manhattan district attorney defends handling of 2015 Harvey Weinstein investigation as shocking audio emerges and allegations of his handling of improper conduct by members of the Trump family around the Trump SoHo development. Critics have suggested that contributions to the DA around these times were directly linked to Vance not prosecuting these cases. Vance has defended the actions of his office, citing insufficient evidence to prosecute in each case. In March 2018, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that the New York State attorney general will investigate the Manhattan district attorney's handling of a 2015 sexual abuse case involving disgraced media mogul Harvey Weinstein. NYPD investigators who investigated the 2015 case believed that the sexual abuse case was strong enough to be prosecuted, but Vance opted not to prosecute the case. The case concerned a 22-year old Filipina-Italian model - Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, who went straight to the police after Weinstein lunged at her, groping her breasts and attempting to put a hand up her skirt while she protested. The next day she met with Weinstein, equipped with a NYPD wire tap. In the recording, published by The New Yorker and ABC News , Weinstein insists - \\"I'm telling you right now, get in here.\\" Gutierrez explicitly refuses, adding \\"yesterday was kind of aggressive for me\\" and asks why he had groped her breast the day before. “Oh, please, I’m sorry, just come on in. I’m used to that. Come on. Please” he says. “You are used to that?” Gutierrez asks. “Yes,” Weinstein replies, later adding: “Don’t ruin your friendship with me for five minutes.” According to The Guardian, the investigators were at the time under the belief that Vance would undermine the case, given that he had previously dropped a similar case against Dominique Strauss-Kahn. David Boies, an attorney who has represented Harvey Weinstein, had donated $10,000 after Vance's office refused to prosecute on the Amber Guitierrez case. Vance has countered that no contribution has influenced his decision making. Vance has heavily prosecuted possession of gravity knives, disproportionately arresting and indicting defendants of color. The law banning them, which was interpreted broadly by Vance and is enforced mainly in Manhattan, has been the subject of several repeal efforts in the New York state legislature. Governor Andrew Cuomo has vetoed two such repeal bills passed in two years by majority votes in both chambers of the state congress. Despite the 70,000 people arrested under this law in ten years, Vance declined to take action against the more than 100 hardware stores selling potential gravity knives in the city. On March 27, 2019, in Cracco v. Vance, No. 14 Civ. 8235 (SDNY), a federal judge ruled that Vance's office had applied the law unconstitutionally, resulting in a lack of notice of prohibited behavior as well as allowing for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Soon after, state lawmakers Dan Quart and Diane Savino introduced a third iteration of the bill repealing the gravity knife ban. On May 31, 2019, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the bill into law, making gravity knives legal to possess in the state of New York. Affiliations Until 2015, Vance served alongside Donald Trump as a member of the Board of Directors of the Police Athletic League of New York City, a non-profit youth development agency that helps inner-city children.

Development In 1924, the British Air Ministry issued Specification 23/24 for a three-engined six/seven-passenger charter airliner.Barnes 1976, p.252. Handley Page's design to meet this requirement, the Hamlet, was a high-wing three-engined monoplane with a conventional landing gear and room for six passengers. The wing was fitted with leading edge slots and flaps to give good landing performance.Barnes 1976, p.254. The only Hamlet was built at Cricklewood in 1926, and registered G-EBNS. It was first flown on 19 October 1926 powered by three 120 hp (90 kW) Bristol Lucifer IV three-cylinder radial engines. The Lucifer gave rise to excessive vibration, particularly in the centre engine, causing the pilot's instruments to be unreadable, and after a final flight with Lucifer engines on 25 October 1926, it was modified with a smaller fin and larger rudder and the engines were changed to two 250 hp (187 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Lynx radial engines, with the nose engine replaced by additional baggage space, first flying in this form on 19 May 1927.Barnes 1976, pp.255-257. This modification eliminated the vibration, but the twin- engined variant was underpowered.Barnes 1976, pp.257-258. In March 1928 it was re-engined again with three 150 hp (112 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Mongoose five- cylinder radial engines although it flew only once in that configuration on delivery to the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough.

Its name in the USGS Geographic Names Information System is Prices Post Office. It is located at the intersection of Oak View Farm Road (South Carolina State Highway 42–200), Old Switzer Road (South Carolina State Highway 42–199), and Price House Road (South Carolina State Highway 42–86). It was named to the National Register of Historic Places on October 28, 1969. History Thomas Price moved to the Spartanburg District around 1793. He was a landowner and entrepreneur. He operated a general store and post office next to his house. The post office was operated from about 1811 to 1820. He farmed about . The house was on the Spartanburg stagecoach line to Cross Anchor, South Carolina. He operated a \\"publick house\\" or tavern and stagecoach stop. When his wife, Anne, died in 1821, she left a forty-two page inventory of the estate. In addition to the house furnishings, the inventory included 25 slaves and agricultural machinery. Going beyond \\"frontier-level,\\" the furnishings included a curtained four poster bed, an 8-day clock, a desk, and a bookcase, and volumes of the Spectator, the Tatler and other publications. The farm equipment included grindstones, a loom, a spinning wheel, a cotton picking machine, and riding chaise. Just after the Civil War, the house came into the hands of Captain George Bobo Dean and, according to Landrum's History of Spartanburg County it was his primary residence until he was elected Sheriff of Spartanburg and moved into town. In the Will of George B. Dean, the house (called \\"My Prince Place\\") was given to his eldest son, James Madison Dean. It remained in the Dean family until about 1936 when it was bought by the Spartanburg County Historical Association. It is a now historic house museum operated by the Spartanburg County Historical Association. It is open on Sunday afternoons throughout the year, on Saturdays in the summer, and by reservations. Architecture The house is a -story, brick house with a gambrel roof. At that time, a gambrel roof was unusual in upstate South Carolina. The thick brickwork on the house is Flemish bond with darkened headers. The rooms are paneled with wood on the walls and ceilings. The first floor has a parlor, called the Pine Room because of its wood paneling, and a large dining room for both the family and stagecoach riders. These two rooms are separated by a central hallway that extends through each story. The second floor has two large and one small bedrooms. The top floor under the eaves has one bedroom for male travelers and one for female travelers. An extension was built to the rear around 1820. The extension was probably built as quarters for the servants. It is constructed of English bond, and is now a kitchen.

The core question of comparative effectiveness research is which treatment works best, for whom, and under what circumstances. Engaging various stakeholders in this process, while difficult, makes research more applicable through providing information that improves patient decision making. The Institute of Medicine committee has defined CER as \\"the generation and synthesis of evidence that compares the benefits and harms of alternative methods to prevent, diagnose, treat, and monitor a clinical condition or to improve the delivery of care. The purpose of CER is to assist consumers, clinicians, purchasers, and policy makers to make informed decisions that will improve health care at both the individual and population levels.\\" Comparative effectiveness research adopts many of the same approaches and methodologies as cost-effectiveness analysis, including the use of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). An important component of CER is the concept of pragmatic randomised controlled trials. These clinical research trials measure the benefit produced by the treatment in routine clinical practice. In the United States Researchers at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy, in addition to the Congressional Budget Office, have documented a large gap in the quality and outcomes and health services being delivered. Unwarranted variation in medical treatment, cost, and outcomes suggests a substantial area for improvement and savings in our health care system. Statistical findings show that \\"patients in the highest-spending regions of the country receive 60 percent more health services than those in the lowest-spending regions, yet this additional care is not associated with improved outcomes.\\" New models of shared decision making promise to bring greater emphasis to informed patient choice for \\"preference-sensitive\\" care, improving quality, safety, and effectiveness of health care by providing both patients and their health care providers with the evidence to assist in informed decision making. In 2009, $1.1 billion of President Barack Obama's stimulus package was earmarked for CER. There was initial disagreement regarding whether CER will be used to limit patient health care options, or help lower health care costs. Ultimately the bill approved by Senate contains measures to utilize CER as a means for increasing quality while reducing rising costs. Several groups have emerged to provide leadership in the area of Comparative Effectiveness Research. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is a federal agency focused on health care quality. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review provides independent evaluation of the clinical effectiveness and comparative value of health care interventions, while also overseeing the New England Comparative Effectiveness Public Advisory Council (CEPAC), an independent body of physicians and patient representatives that aids patients, physicians and policymakers in the application and use of comparative effectiveness information to improve the quality and value of healthcare in the region. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) was established to conduct comparative effectiveness research but the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) prohibits it from using cost per QALY ICER thresholding. The PPACA states: :The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute...shall not develop or employ a dollars per quality adjusted life year (or similar measure that discounts the value of a life because of an individual's disability) as a threshold to establish what type of health care is cost effective or recommended. =Comparing key measures utilized in comparative effectiveness research= The study of comparative effectiveness research (CER) is composed of measures useful in determining the value of various treatment options to help patients make more informed decisions in their own care. While each of these measures provides a useful comparison of one treatment option versus another, they require different inputs into their respective calculations, thus the potential for producing conflicting results. Additionally, some health conditions, such as for prostate cancer treatment, lack patient-centered outcomes to inform comparative effectiveness research. While there remains a widespread lack of understanding on the potential impact of CER in the U.S. and a reluctance to fully adopt the concept as part of our healthcare system, research studies within this area continue to expand across health conditions.

This fire remains the cause of the worst loss of life in a fire in the city's history. Hotel The hotel was located on the northwest corner of Louisiana and Preston Streets and occupied the upper two floors of a three-story brick building, with a variety of businesses occupying the first floor. It was an inexpensive hotel near the city's bus depot, and reportedly had 87 beds, most divided from one another by thin wooden partitions, and 50 cots available for half the price of a bed.Cox, Mike. Texas Disasters: True Stories of Tragedy and Survival. Globe Pequot Press, Sep. 2006. pp 121+. Second floor rooms could be rented $0.40 USD a night and cots in a communal space on the third floor could be rented for $0.20 USD a night. That night the guest log showed 133 names registered.Houston, TX Gulf Hotel Fire, Sept 1943 at GenDisasters.com It was later reported that most of the registered guests were either old, crippled, or drunk.  Fire  Shortly after midnight, the desk clerk was alerted to a smoldering mattress and bed sheet in a room on the second floor, that was thought to have started due to careless smoking. The clerk and a few guests thought they had extinguished the burning mattress and moved it to a closet in the second floor hall. Moments later, the mattress erupted in flames. The fire spread quickly through the second floor and headed toward the third. There were two exits from the hotel, both on the Preston side, one an interior staircase, the other an exterior fire escape. Witnesses described the confusion they experienced during the fire, with one stating; \\"I'm looking for my friends. I called to them in the room next to mine when I woke up, but the smoke was choking me and I couldn't see.\\" The fire department's central station was located only a few blocks away at Preston and Caroline Streets. The alarm was received at 12:50 a.m. Deputy Chief Grover Cleveland Adams was the first to arrive at the burning hotel where he summoned a general alarm as he witnessed flames shooting from windows and the roof. It took two hours for firefighters to get the fire under control. = Evacuation and victims = Ted Felds of Harris County's Emergency Corps arrived at about the same time and noticed many men on the fire escape, including a few on crutches, who were slowing the progress of others behind them still trying to escape. The evacuation on fire escapes soon became disorganized as one had soon become blocked by the fire, causing many to panic and use any means possible to reach the street. Police Homicide Captain C.A. Martindale, responded to the scene and later told reporters that he saw a man running down the fire escape, with his clothing fully engulfed in flames before he jumped off the fire escape and kept running. A city detective H.P. Blanchard, reportedly watched a naked man leap from the third floor of the hotel and then hit an awning before landing on the street. Two men died at the scene after jumping from the hotel's windows. There were 15 other fatalities in area hospitals. Firefighters recovered 38 bodies from the burned out building. In all, 55 people died in the fire and more than 30 were injured.  Aftermath  Donations through the Red Cross, helped make sure that the deceased victims were given proper burials. A mass funeral was held for 23 victims of the fire who were never identified and they were buried at the South Park Cemetery in Houston.McDonald, Thomas A and Mellott, F. Scott, eds.

The group is among the oldest Irish-Catholic membership associations in America.

Although the group's articles of incorporation innocuously stated the group's purpose as the creation of \\"a spirit of mutual helpfulness among its members; to advance them intellectually and socially; and by co-operation among them, to promote their material interests and well- being,\\" in practice the organization served economic and political functions, lending aid to needy Irish immigrants and organizing to fight bigotry and discrimination against the Irish in America.Irish America: Volume 8. Irish Voice, 1992; pg. 8. Of prime importance to the early organization were orphans, the indigent elderly, and financially strapped young men pursuing Catholic priesthood.Jerrold I. Casway, Ed Delahanty in the Emerald Age of Baseball. Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 2004; pg. 97. Cleveland proved to be a fertile ground for organization, and the Knights of Equity soon had established three local groups, known as \\"courts\\", in the city — the largest of which had some 5,000 members. Other Irish communities throughout the Eastern and Midwestern United States soon followed the Cleveland example, establishing local courts of their own. At the peak of the organization's size and influence during its first decade, the Knights of Equity included some 65 local courts stretching from Boston in the East to Sioux City, Iowa in the West, and from the Canada–US border to the Mid-South. In its earliest incarnation, the Knights of Equity was part of the broad Catholic reaction to the Protestant chauvinism espoused by the American Protective Association (APA), an anti-Catholic secret society established in 1887. Working together with other Catholic groups, the Knights of Equity managed to isolate and neutralize the APA and its anti-immigrant nationalism by the end of the 19th century.\\"Why?

As early as 1908 the organization held its ninth annual convention in that city, a three-day affair attended by 500 members from 63 cities. Following World War II, in 1948 there remained about 1,100 members of the KOE in Pittsburgh alone,\\"Knights of Equity Open Convention,\\" Pittsburgh Press, 16 Sep 1948, pg. 27. and that year the 53rd annual Knights of Equity convention, held again in Pittsburgh, was attended by 500 delegates from 11 cities of the East and Midwest. At the 1948 convention the group emphasized its patriotic nature, with assembled delegates demonstratively joining in a so-called \\"Freedom Pledge\\" to fight Communism.

While most wine is consumed within 24 hours of purchase, fine wines are often set aside for long-term storage. Wine is one of the few commodities that can improve in flavour and value with age, but it can also rapidly deteriorate if kept in inadequate conditions. The three factors that have the most direct impact on a wine's condition are light, humidity, and temperature. Historically, the storage of wine was handled by wine merchants. Since the mid-20th century, however, consumers have been increasingly storing their own wine in home-based wine cellars.J. Robinson (ed), \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine,\\" Third Edition, p. 664. Oxford University Press, 2006. . Conditions affecting wine The three factors that have the most pronounced effect on wine in storage are light, humidity, and temperature. =Light= Direct sunlight or incandescent light can adversely react with phenolic compounds in wine and create \\"wine faults\\". Light-bodied white wines run the greatest risk from light exposure, and for that reason, they are often packaged in tinted wine bottles that offer some protection from light. Wines packaged in clear, light green and blue colored bottles are the most vulnerable to light and may need extra precautions for storage. In the cellar, wines are stored in corrugated boxes or wooden crates to protect them from direct light. =Humidity= Some degree of humidity is required in order to keep wines with cork enclosures from drying out. Even when wine bottles are stored on their sides, one side of the cork is still exposed to air. Should the cork begin to dry out, it can allow oxygen to enter the bottle, filling the ullage space and possibly causing the wine to spoil or oxidize. Excessive humidity can also pose the risk of damaging wine labels, which may hinder identification or hurt potential resale value. Wine experts such as Jancis Robinson note that 75% humidity is often cited as ideal but also that there is very little significant research to definitively establish an optimal range. Concern about humidity is one of the primary reasons why wine experts such as Tom Stevenson recommend that wine should not be kept in a refrigerator since the refrigeration process often includes dehumidifying, which can quickly dry out corks. Some wine experts debate the importance of humidity for proper wine storage. In the Wine Spectator, writer Matt Kramer cites a French study which claimed that the relative humidity within a bottle is maintained at 100% regardless of the closure used or the orientation of the bottle.M. Kramer, \\"Seeking Closure.\\" The Wine Spectator, p. 36. 31 October 2007. However, Alexis Lichine contends that low humidity can still be detrimental to premium wine quality due to the risk of the cork drying out. As a way of maintaining optimal humidity, Lichine recommends spreading half an inch of gravel on the floor of a wine cellar and periodically sprinkling it with some water. =Temperature= Madeira is exposed to high temperatures during its winemaking process and is thereby able to sustain exposure to higher temperatures more easily than other wines. Wine is very susceptible to changes in temperature, with temperature control being an important consideration in wine storage. If the wine is exposed to too high a temperature (in excess of ) for long periods of time, it may be spoiled or become \\"cooked\\" and develop off-flavors that taste raisiny or stewed. The exact length of time that a wine is at risk of exposure to high temperatures will vary depending on the wine, with some wines (such as Madeira which is exposed to high temperatures during its winemaking) being able to sustain exposure to high temperatures more easily than other, more delicate wines (such as Riesling). If the wine is exposed to temperatures that are too cold, the wine can freeze and expand, causing the cork to be pushed out or (more usually) the bottle to crack; this will allow more oxygen to be exposed to the wine. Temperature swings (such as repeated transferring a wine from a warm room to a cool refrigerator) can also cause adverse chemical reactions in the wine that may lead to a variety of wine faults. In general, a wine has a greater potential to develop complexity and a more aromatic bouquet if it is allowed to age slowly in a relatively cool environment. The lower the temperature, the more slowly a wine develops.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pp. 5–7 Oxford University Press 2006 On average, the rate of chemical reactions in wine doubles with each 18 °F (10 °C) increase in temperature. Most experts, such as Jancis Robinson, recommend that wine be kept at constant temperatures between 50 and 59 °F (10 and 15 °C). Tom Stevenson speculates that may be the most ideal temperature for storage and aging, while Karen MacNeil recommends keeping wine intended for ageing in a cool area with a constant temperature around . Wine can be stored at temperatures as high as without long-term negative effect. Professor Cornelius Ough of the University of California, Davis believes that wine can be exposed to temperatures as high as for a few hours and not be damaged.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pp. 79–82 Workman Publishing 2001 =Vibration= Although anecdotal information regarding the contributions of vibration in wine storage states that it contributes to the accelerated ageing of wine with adverse effects, this remains a research area with relatively little data. In a particular study, vibrations of different frequencies have been shown to have their own distinct effect on the chemistry of the wine. The study concludes, \\"Vibration could be used to accelerate the ageing of wine, but in most cases, this may lead to negative effects on wine quality. Therefore, to store red wines with limited changes in physicochemical properties, vibrations should be minimized.\\"Effect of vibration and storage on some physicochemical properties of a commercial red wine; Chung, Hyun-Jung  Son, Jin-Ho  Park, Eun-Young  Kim, Eun-Jeong  Lim, Seung-Taik Journal of Food Composition and Analysis, , Vol: 21, Issue: 8, December 2008, pp. 655–659 Orientation of the bottle Most wine racks are designed to allow a wine to be stored on its side. The thinking behind this orientation is that the cork is more likely to stay moist and not dry out if it is kept in constant contact with the wine. Some wineries package their wines upside down in the box for much the same reason. Research in the late 1990s suggested that the ideal orientation for wine bottles is at a slight angle, rather than completely horizontal. This allows the cork to maintain partial contact with the wine in order to stay damp but also keeps the air bubble formed by a wine's ullage at the top rather than in the middle of the bottle if the wine is lying on its side. Keeping the ullage near the top, it has been argued, allows for a slower and more gradual oxidation and maturation process. This is because the pressure of the air bubble that is the ullage space rises and falls depending on temperature fluctuation. When exposed to higher temperatures the bubble's pressure increases (becomes positive relative to the air outside of the bottle), and if the wine is tilted at an angle, this compressed gas will diffuse through the cork and not harm the wine. When the temperature falls the process reverses. If the wine is completely on its side then this action will eject some wine through the cork. Through this \\"breathing\\" which can result from variations in temperature, oxygen may be repeatedly introduced into the bottle and as a result, can react with the wine. An appropriate and constant temperature is therefore preferred. Additionally, oxidation will occur more rapidly at higher temperatures and gases dissolve into liquids faster the lower the temperature.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Wine Course Third Edition pp. 42–44 Abbeville Press 2003 Champagne is often recommended to be stored upright rather than lying on its side. While most wines can benefit from lying on their side, Champagne and other sparkling wines tend to age better if they are kept upright. This is because the internal pressure caused by the trapped carbonic gas provides enough humidity and protection from oxygen. Caterer Magazine claims that the preference for upright storage of Champagne is shared by the Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne (CIVC) who conducted an extensive study of Champagnes that were stored in various conditions and orientations. This study found that Champagne stored on its side aged more quickly because oxygen was allowed to seep in after the Champagne corks lost their elasticity due to contact with the wine.Caterer Magazine \\"The lay down on storage\\" 26 July 2001 However, the Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne (CIVC) still recommends storing Champagne on its side, which can be read on their website at: http://www.champagne.fr/en/tasting-and- appreciation/art-of-serving-champagne/storing-champagne-bottles where it is stated: \\"Champagne is ready for drinking upon release, matured to perfection in the producer’s cellars. \\"It will, however, keep well for several years if stored on its side in a cool, dark, draft-free place, following the three golden rules of Champagne storage: * Constant, low ambient temperature (around 10 °C/50 °F) * Generous humidity * No direct exposure to sunlight, noise or excessive vibration.\\"The Comité Champagne Alternative wine closures Storing wine that is bottled with alternative wine closures other than cork, have many of the same considerations in regards to temperature and light sensitivity. While humidity and concerns about oxidation are not as pronounced, the relatively recent popularity and increased usage of these closures have not given many opportunities for research into the storage and ageing potential of wines that use these closures. Places to store wine Since the end of the 20th century, there has been growth in industries relating to wine storage. Some wine connoisseurs may elect to store their wine at home in a dedicated room, closet or cellarette. Other options involve purchases and rentals at off-site wine storage facilities that are specifically designed for the task. Wine will prematurely develop if stored in an environment that has large temperature variations, particularly if these occur frequently. Temperature control systems ensure the wine cellar temperature is very stable. The variations cause corks to expand and contract which leads to oxidation of the wine. If wine is stored in conditions that are too dry, the cork will shrink and cause leakage. Too moist, and mould and contamination may occur. Climate Controlled Wine Storage maintains moderate humidity levels (55%–75%) to avoid these problems and assist in the optimum wine development conditions. Some industries focus on the construction of home wine cellars and wine caves, small rooms or spaces in which to store wine. Others produce smaller wine accessories, such as racks and wine refrigerators. These appliances can feature adjustable temperature interfaces, two chambers for red and white wines and materials which protect the wine from the sun and ambient environment. Wine preservation and dispensing systems have also been developed that store wine at their optimal temperatures and use nitrogen gas to dispense the wine. Nitrogen gas helps prevent wine from oxidation and premature spoilage.

It was founded in 1920 by Firmin Gémier in Paris. Today, the TNP has a company of ten resident actors and the building is currently being completely renovated.  History  The Théâtre National Populaire (TNP) was founded in 1920 in Paris at the Palais de Chaillot by Firmin Gémier. During World War II, activity was suspended and the building was occupied by the United Nations. In 1951, Jean Vilar was appointed head of the new theater by Jeanne Laurent. The theater reopened at Suresnes pending the return to the Palais de Chaillot. Vilar thought of the theater as a public service, and gave it a new image. Under his leadership the theater offered performances shown at prices and times to suit the general public. The TNP attracted a group of young actors including Gérard Philipe. Productions from this time include Le Cid and Der Prinz von Homburg by Heinrich von Kleist. Vilar hired the young composer Maurice Jarre as music director. Jarre scored 36 plays including the famous Lorenzaccio. In 1963, Georges Wilson succeeded Vilar and created a second room devoted to contemporary writers. In 1972 the French Minister of Cultural Affairs (Jacques Duhamel) decided to move the TNP to Villeurbanne, near Lyon. Specifically, to the Théâtre de la Cité, founded by Roger Planchon in 1957.

Vision is a registered society of, and is funded by the University of York Students' Union (YUSU). The paper is distinguished from its campus rival, Nouse, by its tabloid design, tone and anarchic sense of humour. Organisation Unlike many other university newspapers, which have sabbatical editors, York Visions staff is made up entirely of current students. The current Editors are Brooke Davies and Iwan Stone. The newspaper itself contains several sections, with Opinion, Features, Lifestyle, Science, SCENE, and Climate bookended by news and sport. Special features Vision has a number of features that help mould its distinct character. These include: *Interviews: Almost every section of the paper has, at one time or another, secured a top-tier interview. Recent highlights include Alastair Campbell, Miley Cyrus, Karl Pilkington, Hot Chip, Guantanamo detainee Moazzam Begg, Nick Clegg, Mark Watson, Franz Ferdinand, Shami Chakrabarti, Aaron Porter, Wretch 32, Dr Jessen, Harry Enfield and Sarah Beeny. *SCENE: The arts pullout containing sections dedicated to Screen, Stage, Music, Books, Games, Relationships, Food, and Travel. *The Roses Specials: Either an annual pull-out published after the Roses Tournament, or a limited-run, special edition distributed during the tournament itself. The 2008 Roses review was incorporated into the Sport section. 2012 saw the largest scale Roses coverage yet, both online and in print, including a 16-page pull-out produced away from home at Lancaster University. *Goalside: A pull-out dedicated to coverage of the summer term 'College Cup', which dominates summer sport at the University of York, first published in 2012. *FRESH: The freshers magazine given to all new students at the University of York. Notable former contributors *Mark Watts *Ste Curran *Dan Roberts - Guardian Brexit editor *Greg Jenner - Horrible Histories comedian *Rajini Vaidyanathan - BBC News North America correspondent *Rob Harris - Associated Press reporter  Controversies  In early 2018, The Lemon Press, the University of York's satirical student magazine, accused York Vision of erroneously claiming to be the \\"most awarded student newspaper\\" in the country. The outcome of their investigation suggested that the United Kingdom's most awarded student newspaper was The Gryphon, of the University of Leeds. In response, York Vision changed their Twitter description to \\"one of the most awarded student publications\\". The October 2018 issue of York Vision was removed from circulation for a back page advert that consisted of a link to an online submission form, and the heading \\"Send Nudes\\". The page received condemnation from the University of York Students' Union, which also claimed that issue had been published without their required approval.. The paper was then sanctioned by YUSU and the society was suspended from operating until the start of the 2019/20 academic year under new leadership. Awards York Vision has received awards for its writing, design, and in both overall best publication and best small budget categories (due to the lack of sabbatical positions of the paper). In 2009 it was the only student newspaper without a full-time paid member of staff to be nominated for Guardian Student Newspaper of the Year. It won the award four times in six years, having held the award from 2002–2004. Vision remains the only paper to achieve the remarkable hat- trick in the ceremony's 26-year history. In 2011, Vision was named Student Publication of the Year at the Guardian Student Media Awards. =Guardian Student Media Awards=2015 * Best Opinion Writer: Edward Greenwood (Nominee)  2014  * Best Publication (Winner) * Best Reporter: Patrick Greenfield (Winner) 2013 * Best Publication (Runner up) * Best Website (Nominee) 2012 * Best Reporter: Oliver Todd (Nominee)  2011  * Best Publication (Winner) 2010 * Best Publication (Nominee) * Best Reporter: Daniel Goddard (Nominee) * Best Reporter: Martin Williams (Nominee) * Best Writer: Jim Norton (Nominee) 2009 * Best Newspaper (Nominee) * Best Reporter: Martin Williams (Nominee) * Best Reporter: Tom McDermott (Nominee) * Best Sports Writer: Jim Norton (Nominee) 2008 *Best Reporter: Adam Thorn (Runner up) *Best Feature Writer: Anna Wormleighton (Nominee) *Best Sports Writer: Grumpy Panda Alex Richman (Runner up) *Best Sports Writer: Tom Sheldrick (Nominee) 2007 *Best Newspaper (Winner) *Best Reporter: Lucy Taylor (Winner) *Best Reporter: Adam Thorn (Nominee) *Best Sports Writer: Darius Austin (Nominee) *Best Critic: Richard Webb (Winner) 2006 *Best Columnist: Ruth Mclean (Nominee) 2005 *Best Newspaper (Nominee) *Best Small Budget Publication (Nominee) *Best Sports Writer: Simon Osborn (Winner) *Best Columnist: Jonathan Bray (Winner) 2004 *Best Newspaper (Winner) *Best Small Budget Publication (Runner up) *Best Journalist: Jon Bentham (Winner) *Best Reporter: Jon Bentham (Nominee) *Best Feature Writer: Jon Bentham (Runner up) 2003 *Best Newspaper (Winner) *Best Small Budget Publication (Nominee) *Best Journalist: Rob Harris (Winner) *Best Reporter: Rob Harris (Winner) *Best Travel Writer: Jon Bentham (Winner) * Best Travel Writer: Rob Harris (Nominee) 2002 *Best Newspaper (Winner) *Best Columnist: Gareth Walker (Winner) *Best Website (Winner) 2001 *Best Website (Runner up) = Student Publication Association Awards = 2020 * Best Publication (Pending) * Best Newspaper Design (Pending) * Billy Dowling-Reid Award for Outstanding Commitment – Harry Clay and Chay Quinn (Pending) * Best Science/Tech Piece – Maddie Jenkins (Pending) 2017 * Outstanding Commitment – Abbie Llewelyn (Winner) * Best News Story – Josh Salisbury (Shortlisted) * Best News Story – Huw James (Shortlisted) * Best News Story – Abbie Llewelyn (Shortlisted) 2016 * Best Comment – Costas Mourselas (Highly Commended) * Best Publication (Shortlisted) * Best Sports Coverage (Shortlisted) * Best Reporter – Thomas Butler-Roberts (Shortlisted) * Best News Story – Jonny Long & Abbie Llewelyn (Shortlisted) * Best Feature – Jonny Long (Shortlisted) =National Union of Students Awards= *2014 Best Journalist: Jack Gevertz (Winner) *2012 Best Media (Runner up) *2012 Best Journalist: Oliver Todd (Highly Commended) *2008 Best Journalist: Lucy Taylor (Nominee) =National Union of Students Journalism Awards= *2006 Best Small Budget Publication (Winner) *2004 Best Publication Design (Winner) *2004 Best Feature Writer: Jon Bentham (Winner) *2004 Best Arts Journalist: Sam Walton (Runner up) *2003 Best Newspaper (Winner) *2003 Best Reporter: Rob Harris (Winner) *2003 Best Arts Journalist: Bella Todd (Winner) *2001 Best Small Budget Publication (Winner) ReferencesExternal links *yorkVision Category:University of York Category:Student newspapers published in the United Kingdom Category:Publications established in 1987 Category:Mass media in York Category:Newspapers published in Yorkshire ","title":"York Vision"},{"id":"22779666","text":"Vision (formerly nWeb) was a mobile browser developed by Novarra Inc. that ran on Java Platform, Micro Edition.

The state park offers opportunities for hiking, fishing, and boating. History General Wooster led his troops down Old Barlow Mountain Road during the Revolutionary War. John Barlow's blacksmith shop was located here. An old foundation of the Scott House dating from the 1720s can be seen at the boat launch area. The stone walls and enclosures in the park were built by the Scott family when they farmed the land. Diplomat Seth Low Pierrepont purchased the land from the Scott family in the 1930s, improving the property by having a dam built at an \\"impassable swamp\\" and creating Lake Naraneka. He bequeathed a portion of his estate, including the south and eastern shores of the lake, to the state upon his death in 1956. The opposite shore of the lake was sold to developers by his widow. Activities and amenities The park's five blazed trails include one around the south end of Lake Naraneka (Pierrepont Pond). The park's main trail is the white trail, which goes along Pierrepont Lake from the parking lot, ascends to the highest point in the park, and then descends to a minor entrance. Hiking is easy around the lake, but moderate, with steep sections everywhere else. The top of Barlow Mountain offers views of Pierrepont Lake, Redding hills, and on rare occasions, Long Island Sound.

H. Holmes, who is renamed \\"G. Gordon Gregg\\" for the story. Synopsis Inspired by the case of real-life serial killer H. H. Holmes, the story follows maniacal surgeon G. Gordon Gregg, who preys on young beautiful women and, luring them into his labyrinthine castle, kills them, thus orchestrating the perfect series of crimes. However, an ambitious Chicago journalist called Crystal (last name never given) becomes suspicious of Gregg, a feeling made much more complicated by her attraction to him and vice versa. Crystal also must balance her own career with that of her fiancé, an insurance agent named Jim Frazer, and her boss Charlie Hogan, who is tolerant and kind and believes Crystal's story. Posing as the niece of one of Gregg's victims, Crystal finds employment with Gregg as his secretary, discovering over time damning clues as to Gregg's true nature. Hogan infiltrates the castle, finding Gregg's laboratory and the horrors within. There, Gregg ambushes him, knocking him unconscious. Meanwhile, Crystal also finds a secret entrance to the cellar and enters it. Gregg attacks Crystal, but she and Charlie Hogan hold him off. Hogan douses Gregg with acid; reeling, Gregg fatally impales himself on a scalpel. After Hogan and Crystal escape, they express feelings for one another, and as the castle burns down, the 1893 World's Fair is brought to its spectacular end.

It is believed that there are infinitely many such number fields, but this has not been proven. Definition The class number of a number field is by definition the order of the ideal class group of its ring of integers. Thus, a number field has class number 1 if and only if its ring of integers is a principal ideal domain (and thus a unique factorization domain). The fundamental theorem of arithmetic says that Q has class number 1.  Quadratic number fields  These are of the form K = Q(), for a square-free integer d. =Real quadratic fields= K is called real quadratic if d > 0. K has class number 1 for the following values of d : * 2*, 3, 5*, 6, 7, 11, 13*, 14, 17*, 19, 21, 22, 23, 29*, 31, 33, 37*, 38, 41*, 43, 46, 47, 53*, 57, 59, 61*, 62, 67, 69, 71, 73*, 77, 83, 86, 89*, 93, 94, 97*, ...Chapter I, section 6, p. 37 of (complete until d = 100) *: The narrow class number is also 1 (see related sequence A003655 in OEIS). Despite what would appear to be the case for these small values, not all prime numbers that are congruent to 1 modulo 4 appear on this list, notably the fields Q() for d = 229 and d = 257 both have class number greater than 1 (in fact equal to 3 in both cases).H. Cohen, A Course in Computational Algebraic Number Theory, GTM 138, Springer Verlag (1993), Appendix B2, p.507 The density of such primes for which Q() does have class number 1 is conjectured to be nonzero, and in fact close to 76%,H. Cohen and H. W. Lenstra, Heuristics on class groups of number fields, Number Theory, Noordwijkerhout 1983, Proc. 13th Journées Arithmétiques, ed. H. Jager, Lect. Notes in Math. 1068, Springer-Verlag, 1984, pp. 33—62 however it is not even known whether there are infinitely many real quadratic fields with class number 1. = Imaginary quadratic fields = K has class number 1 exactly for the following negative values of d: * −1, −2, −3, −7, −11, −19, −43, −67, −163. (By definition, these also all have narrow class number 1.)  Cubic fields  Totally real cubic field = The first 60 totally real cubic fields (ordered by discriminant) have class number one. In other words, all cubic fields of discriminant between 0 and 1944 (inclusively) have class number one. The next totally real cubic field (of discriminant 1957) has class number two. The polynomials defining the totally real cubic fields that have discriminants less than 500 with class number one are:Tables available at Pari source code = Complex cubic field = All complex cubic fields with discriminant greater than −500 have class number one, except the fields with discriminants −283, −331 and −491 which have class number 2. The polynomials defining the complex cubic fields that have class number one and discriminant greater than −500 are: Cyclotomic fields The following is a complete list of n for which the field Q(ζn) has class number 1: * 1 through 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 45, 48, 50, 54, 60, 66, 70, 84, 90.Note that values of n congruent to 2 modulo 4 are redundant since Q(ζ2n) = Q(ζn) when n is odd. On the other hand, the maximal real subfields Q(cos(2π/2n)) of the 2-power cyclotomic fields Q(ζ2n) (where n is a positive integer) are known to have class number 1 for n≤8,J. C. Miller, Class numbers of totally real fields and applications to the Weber class number problem, https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1094 and it is conjectured that they have class number 1 for all n. Weber showed that these fields have odd class number. In 2009, Fukuda and Komatsu showed that the class numbers of these fields have no prime factor less than 107, and later improved this bound to 109. These fields are the n-th layers of the cyclotomic Z2-extension of Q. Also in 2009, Morisawa showed that the class numbers of the layers of the cyclotomic Z3-extension of Q have no prime factor less than 104. Coates has raised the question of whether, for all primes p, every layer of the cyclotomic Zp- extension of Q has class number 1. CM fields Simultaneously generalizing the case of imaginary quadratic fields and cyclotomic fields is the case of a CM field K, i.e. a totally imaginary quadratic extension of a totally real field. In 1974, Harold Stark conjectured that there are finitely many CM fields of class number 1. He showed that there are finitely many of a fixed degree. Shortly thereafter, Andrew Odlyzko showed that there are only finitely many Galois CM fields of class number 1. In 2001, V. Kumar Murty showed that of all CM fields whose Galois closure has solvable Galois group, only finitely many have class number 1. A complete list of the 172 abelian CM fields of class number 1 was determined in the early 1990s by Ken Yamamura and is available on pages 915–919 of his article on the subject. Combining this list with the work of Stéphane Louboutin and Ryotaro Okazaki provides a full list of quartic CM fields of class number 1.

He coached ARL premiership expansion club Western Reds in their first two seasons before moving to France to take up the coaching position of Super League expansion team, Paris Saint-Germain. Before moving to the Bulldogs, Mulholland was Assistant Coach from 1999–2001 and Director of Recruitment (2002–2008) at the Penrith Panthers.  Playing career  A clever with an uncanny knack for winning scrum possession, Mulholland had a brief stint for the Canterbury- Bankstown club in 1973. Playing in the Group 6 Rugby League competition, Mulholland had stints at Camden Rams RLFC, Oakdale Workers RLFC, Campbelltown City Kangaroos RLFC and Narellan Jets RLFC. Mulholland was instrumental in the Camden Rams 1978 Group 6 premiership victory over the Campbelltown RSL Warriors.  Schoolboy Coaching Career  While playing in Group 6, Mulholland cut his coaching teeth under the watchful eye of Brother Silverius at St Gregory's College, Campbelltown. Over a period of 14 years from 1979–1993, Mulholland would establish 'St Gregs' as Australia's pre-eminent Rugby League school. Indeed, St Gregory's Campbelltown still hold the record for national schoolboy Rugby League championships with 9 title victories.

St Gregs has waned as a schoolboy Rugby League power since 1993. So immediate was the effect of Mulholland's departure upon the school's fortunes, St Gregory's were defeated by local minnows Eaglevale High in the 1st Round of the 1994 Commonwealth Bank Cup, despite boasting a team studded with future NRL players like Trent Barrett, Peter Cusack, Simon Bonnetti, Trent Robinson and Russell Richardson.  Schoolboy Players Coached  During his tenure as Head Coach of St Gregory's 1st XIII, Mulholland coached future NSWRL stars like Jason Taylor, Ivan Henjak and Michael Potter. Mulholland also oversaw the development of many future 1st Graders like Matt Fuller, Michael Francis, Wayne Evans, Tim Horan, Damien Chapman.  Grade coaching career  Mulholland's unrivalled success as a schoolboy mentor soon brought him to the attention of Sydney clubs competing in the NSWRL. Having fielded offers from Canterbury and Parramatta, Mulholland decided to stay local and assume the reins of the Western Suburbs Magpies U-21 team for the 1988 season, under head coach Laurie Freier. Mulholland would coach lower grades with the Magpies until the end of the 1992 season, achieving mixed success. Mulholland was poached by the North Sydney Bears to coach that club's Reserve Grade team for the 1993 season. Mulholland would take the next step with this team, winning the 1993 NSWRL Reserve Grade premiership with a narrow 5-4 victory over an Andrew Johns-led Newcastle Knights team.  The Western Reds  At the conclusion of the 1992 season, the NSWRL announced its intention to admit three new clubs to the 1st Grade competition for 1995- the Western Reds, South Queensland Crushers and North Queensland Cowboys. Mulholland was soon head-hunted by Reds CEO Gordon Allen to be the Western Reds foundation coach. Agreeing to terms midway through the 1993 season, Mulholland launched an audacious recruitment drive, luring Australian Kangaroos Brad Mackay and Mark Geyer to the golden west. With All Black test centre Craig Innes, Norwich Rising Star Matthew Rodwell and emerging test prop Rodney Howe in the depth chart, the Reds set a strong base for their debut season. The Western Reds would win their first ever ARL match with a 28-16 victory over the St George Dragons in front of a sellout crowd at the WACA Ground. Ironically, former St Gregs prodigy Matt Fuller would score the Reds first try. Mulholland would make the famous quote post match: \\"we had 18 months to prepare for this game. Now we only have 7 days to prepare for the next.\\" The Skull's words would come back to haunt him in Newcastle a week later when David Waite's Knights buckled the Reds by 48-6, in a battle of the schoolboy master coaches. Recruitment Manager Mulholland worked for NRL team, the Penrith Panthers during the period when they won the 2003 NRL Premiership. He started working for the Bulldogs' coaching staff in 2008. In August 2010 it was reported that Mulholland would be leaving Canterbury-Bankstown to spend the 2011 NRL season working as Wayne Bennett's recruitment manager when he moved to Nathan Tinkler's newly acquired Newcastle Knights. He has been recruitment manager at the St. George-Illawarra Dragons during 2014-2015 and is joining the Canberra Raiders in that capacity for the 2016 NRL season.Rugby League Week. 15/10/2015 References Category:Australian rugby league coaches Category:Paris Saint-Germain Rugby League coaches Category:Western Reds coaches Category:Rugby league hookers Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Peter Mulholland"},{"id":"22779762","text":"Timeline of the occupation of the Baltic States lists key events in the military occupation of the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania by the Soviet Union and by Nazi Germany during World War II. 1939 *March 20, 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania was an oral ultimatum presented to Juozas Urbšys, Foreign Minister of Lithuania, by Joachim von Ribbentrop, Foreign Minister of Nazi Germany.

It is one of the original four ‘sponsored’ internet namespaces - specialized TLDs that represent a community most affected by the TLD. .coop TLD has been managed by DotCoop LLC since 2002 when the contract with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was first agreed. As the sponsor of the .coop TLD, DotCoop LLC works within a charter defining the purpose for which the .coop TLD was created and how it is to be operated. It is responsible for developing policies that ensure the TLD is operated for the benefit of the global cooperative community. It is also responsible for selecting the registry operator and, to varying degrees, for establishing the roles played by registrars and their relationship with the registry operator. DotCoop LLC exercises its delegated authority according to fairness standards and in a manner that is representative of the global cooperative community Aims The .coop domain suffix allows cooperatives to identify themselves as member-owned businesses on the Internet and to help consumers find the businesses they trust online. The .coop domain reflects the cooperative movement’s aims of growing awareness of the movement and the benefits of cooperative activity online with both the global cooperative community and the wider public. Organisation DotCoop was set up in 2001 by the Midcounties Cooperative to manage the .coop TLD through a subsidiary; Midcounties Co-operative Domains. This body managed the technical operations of the .coop registry under a contract with DotCoop. In 2012, Midcounties Co- operative Domains became Domains.coop, a wholly owned subsidiary of the ICA.

Stemmons was born in Dallas on November 8, 1876, the son of John Martin and Rebecca (née Allison) Stemmons. He attended Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas and graduated from the University of Chicago. Before returning to Dallas in 1900 to work selling fire insurance and real estate, Stemmons worked briefly in Chicago real estate. On July 16, 1902, he married Elizabeth Story. They had three children. Elizabeth died on January 3, 1910. On October 4, 1915, Stemmons married Proctor Howell. They had one son. As a real estate agent, Stemmons developed the Miller-Stemmons addition, Winnetka Heights, Rosemont Crest, Sunset Hill, Sunset Annex, Sunset Summit, Sunset Heights, and Sunset Crest in Oak Cliff. He was a leader in the annexation of Oak Cliff and the building of the Houston Street Viaduct between Dallas and Oak Cliff. Stemmons was also a president and director of Atlas Metal Works, a director of Southwestern Land and Loan Company, and a director of Evergreen Hills, Incorporated. He was a member of the Dallas Historical Society, the Methodist Church, and the Dallas Real Estate Board. In 1908 the Trinity River overflowed Commerce Street by 52.6 feet [conversion required], and the Ulrickson Committee was formed to draft a flood-control plan. Leslie Stemmons served on the committee. In 1926 he helped establish the City and County of Dallas Levee Improvement District and served as the chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the District. The plan involved moving the Trinity River channel one mile west and building a series of levees. In 1928 the city gave a group of river bottomland owners, the Industrial Properties Association, a charter to develop the reclaimed land for industrial use, as the Trinity Industrial District. After Stemmons died, his sons carried on the project. In later years the Stemmons family donated much of the valuable right-of-way for the building of the Stemmons Freeway. Stemmons died at his home in Dallas on October 15, 1939, and was buried in Oak Cliff Cemetery.http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fstan References Category:1876 births Category:1939 deaths Category:American real estate businesspeople Category:Businesspeople from Texas Category:People from Dallas Category:People from Oak Cliff, Texas ","title":"Leslie Stemmons"},{"id":"22779859","text":"Shipp is the surname of the following people: *Alana Shipp (born 1982), American/Israeli professional bodybuilder *Andrew Shipp (born 1979), Australian rules footballer *Billy Shipp (born 1929), retired Canadian Football League player *Charley Shipp (1913-1988), American basketball player and coach *Don Shipp (born 1969), American artist and poet *Ellis Reynolds Shipp (1847–1939), one of the first female doctors in the American West (Utah) *E.

In 1982, Ross came up with a new format for radio called The Castlereagh Line. The story can be best described as Poldark meets Outlander set in Colonial Australia. Each episode is approximately 6 minutes in duration. Originally contracted for 65 episodes, it ran for 910 and was aired on over 100 stations Nationally and Internationally, this was more than any Australian serial ever. At a time when radio drama had long been put out to pasture, 2WS saw its potential. The program was so popular that factories downed tools to enable the staff to listen to it. According to an article in The Sydney Morning Herald in 1984 “Devotees are continually ringing the station to find out what will happen in the next three weeks as they have to know, or they can’t go on holiday”. The radio serial has been re-run nationally several times over and continues to run to this day. Ross loved the Castlereagh project. He and wife Ann researched all the locations where the story took place, driving around Tamworth and Glen Innes and visiting all the old coaching stations. During the course of ‘The Line’s’ initial broadcast from 1982–1986, Ross wrote the first three Castlereagh novels: The Castlereagh Line, The Castlereagh Way and The Colours of Castlereagh. The books were sold in all major and most independent bookstores nationally, including Angus & Robertson, Dymocks and Collins, with 'Line' and 'Way' going into reprint due to popular demand. Over the next few years came four more Castlereagh novels: The Castlereagh Heritage, The Castlereagh Rose, The Castlereagh Crown and The Castlereagh Cross. The never-before-published grand finale, The Castlereagh Requiem, was drafted before Ross died in 2004. The manuscript is currently being edited by his daughter Linzi who has formed Castlereagh Publishing and Productions with good friend Jacqui Law-Smith. The Company owns copyright of the books and original radio scripts. They plan to re-release the novels, record an updated version of the audio series for radio and podcast as well as turning the phenomenally successful Australian Saga into an 8-season television series. The Story The drama begins in Colonial Australia in 1880, when 19 yo Carlotta Clemens leaves her dearest friend and the safety of their home in Brisbane to take a job as governess on a remote Queensland cattle station. Attacked by her employer, and fearing for her life she murders him in self-defence and escapes on horseback to the outback mining town of Cloncurry. Changing her name to escape detection, she finds work as a barmaid under the pseudonym Lottie Long. It is January 2nd, 1880. Three months later, 'Black’ Jack Seager appears in her saloon bar. Despite his dangerously aggressive manner, she senses in him an opportunity for escape, and together they travel south, eventually settling in Tamworth. Now pregnant with his child, she poses as Mrs Seager, and partnering with horse trader Mat Gore, they use blood money to establish the Castlereagh Coach Company, a coach line servicing northern New South Wales. The company flourishes, and with the help of corrupt politician Simon Summers, they secure the New South Wales mail contracts to subsidise expansion. New South Wales is not enough, however. Queensland is crucial, and to secure the contracts, Jack deserts Lottie on the day of their son's birth and courts the daughter of Queensland's Postmaster General. Determined to expose him, Lottie arrives in Toowoomba on his wedding day, only to be savagely assaulted and left in no doubt as to Jack's deadly intentions should she get in his way ever again. Hell hath no fury. Lottie sells her shares in Castlereagh and with the duplicitous aid of Simon Summers, uses Jack's transport empire to build her own chain of hotels along every Castlereagh route. Jack cannot be bested. Hell-bent on revenge, his obsession with Lottie spans two decades as he blazes a trail of infamy and mayhem, destroying all in his path. Betrayal. Corruption. Blackmail. Murder. Unrequited love. The Castlereagh Line has it all. ''' From 2012, Grace Gibson Productions commenced the issuing of the entire 1980s radio serial on CD, for public purchase https://gracegibsonradio.com Broadcast Between 2 February 2009 and 16 November 2011, the serial was broadcast as part of the Bob Rogers Show on 2CH in Sydney, and until 9 October 2013 on Nightline with Bruce & Phil on 3AW in Melbourne.

The book has sold over 1 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 13 languages. She was portrayed in the film Everest (2015) by actress Charlotte Bøving. Lene Gammelgaard was the 35th woman and the first Scandinavian woman to climb Mount Everest, reaching the peak via the South East Ridge route. She accomplished this feat on 10 May 1996 as part of Scott Fischer's Sagarmatha Environmental Expedition. This is one of the most remembered expeditions in the history of Mt Everest.  Early life  Gammelgaard was born in Copenhagen Denmark, to Kirsten and Helge Nielsen, a businessman. When she was growing up, her family moved every three years due to her father's career. This forced her to redefine herself and adapt to new circumstances. It also gave her insight into different parts of the world. Gammelgaard said \\"I was more of an observer than impulsive in the forefront. I kept to myself more than being an extrovert socializer. I was definitely wild and thrived the best riding my horse bareback in the remote parts of Denmark.\\" When she was 22 years old, one of her brothers died in an accident. She later said \\"Get busy living or get busy dying. If you were to die in 24 hours are you then living life the way you find meaningful? If not what are you willing to do to change it? Your life is not going to improve until you do\\". She pursued higher education at the same time as ocean sailing and climbing tours.  Career  At the age of 20, after finishing college, she sailed the Caribbean working as a deck hand and later crossed the Atlantic on a yacht via the Azores. In 1982, she attended the University of Copenhagen where she achieved a law degree specializing in tax and company law. She worked full- time and studied at night as a finance analyst at Erik Møller's Efterfolgere which was the largest stock brokers company in Denmark at that time. In 1988 she took a break and sailed from Zealand to Gibraltar as a co-navigator on a Nautical 42 for a 3-month trip. Later that year she worked as a purchasing manager in charge of negotiations, legal and transport issues dealing with Hong-Kong, Singapore and Thailand in Pinetta Textile Company. She was also the project leader and activist at Greenpeace. In 1991 she went back to school on a supplementary study at Danish school of journalism. It was during this year that her mountain climbing passion was sparked. She spent three months on a climbing and trekking expedition around Dhaulagiri Massif. She then made an attempt on Island peak in Nepal as a single climber. During this attempt she encountered Scott Fischer and his friends who had just climbed Mera Peak. Scott Fischer would later become her friend and mentor. In 1993 she studied psychotherapy using the American 12-step method, a degree in psychotherapy specializing in addictions and installing life altering self-responsibility habits. She co-founded two drug-treatment centers, developed and led a therapy program for professionals and co-dependents aimed at changing individuals’ mental attitudes and behavior towards self-responsibility in one-week processes. In 1995 she embarked on an expedition with Scott Fischer and Mountain Madness to the Karakorum mountain range, Broad Peak base camp and Gondogoro Pass in Pakistan. It was during this expedition on the glacier below K2 that Fischer invited her to climb Mt. Everest in the spring of 1996 with him. 1996 saw her reach the summit of Everest and safely return, on an expedition which claimed many lives, including Fischer who died on the way back from the summit. This expedition received a lot of media attention and multiple films and documentaries were based on it. The experience opened many doors for her career. In 1997 she went on a reconnaissance to Peru, Chile, and Argentina, participated in a horse expedition and helped take a young Greenlandic woman from a human resource development program. As an expedition leader on a trip to Kilimanjaro, she instructed 8 African youths from the slums of Arusha and taught them to become helpers on trips for African Environment, African Adventure Agent and National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS). She then went on another reconnaissance and participated in a documentary film from Greenland. In 1998 as an expedition leader she led 12 Danes to Mt Kilimanjaro. It was in this year that she published her bestselling book Climbing High and went on promotional tours. She participated in a sea kayaking expedition course in Alaska with NOLS and fishing expeditions in Greenland. She also participated in a reconnaissance in Sweden for Human resource developmental programme. In 1999 her book ‘Habets Sejr’ – ‘The Victory of Hope’ was published in Denmark. The Victory of Hope is a strategic self-programming process aimed to instill the will to survive and overcome any setback. She was an expedition leader and organizer of Upper Mustang, Nepal trek. She went on a sailing trip to the Goeteborg Skargaard and British Virgin Islands. In April 2005 she went on a trekking trip to the Atlas Mountains, Morocco and a horse trek in Utah and Arizona with Equestrian Tours. In 2006 she was the captain of her off-shore sailing yacht Van de Stadt 34 from Amsterdam to Copenhagen through the North Sea. She lived for 14 months in Nepal when her mission to adopt her daughter was disrupted by the peace process and UNICEF. She shared her experiences of being victimized by the international adoption and humanitarian process in her book Mitlivskamp \\"The struggle of my life”. She says “Everest and “fighting for my daughter” has taught me the importance of determination and never giving up. Quitting is not in my vocabulary”. In 2008 she broadcast Storm over Everest, a documentary by US film maker David Breashears, with the mountaineers who were caught in the death zone on Everest May 1996. Later that year Gammelgaard was awarded the Mt. Everest Golden Jubilee Medal by Nepals Government. In 2009 she received a Nepal Tourism Board award for her focus on expanding tourism in Nepal and was later nominated as the Honorary Goodwill Ambassador by the board. 20 years after 10 May 1996 Gammelgaard published To the Summit and Safe Return in which she gave her extensive account and reflections on Everest 1996. She gives an account of her experience sharing life mountaineers such as Anatoli Boukreev and Scott Fischer and the way they impacted her and she approaches existences. She currently operates her own consulting business, Human Innovation. She also works as a professional lecturer and author. Gammelgaard is often published in leading Danish and German newspapers and magazines. She works to raise funds for the Lapka Sherpa Educational Fund, which pays for education for orphaned daughters of Sherpa mountaineers in Nepal.EverestHistory.com bio  Climbing High  Climbing High is an account of Gammelgaard's experiences and memories while climbing Mount Everest. On this expedition, she became the 35th woman and first Scandinavian woman to reach the peak of Mount Everest. She writes about how she was inspired to take on this adventure by Scott Fischer, and how she mentally prepared for the climb as part of the Sargarmantha Environmental Expedition. She writes of how she planned to climb without supplementary oxygen partly as a kick start to open the European market to Mountain Madness, Scott Fischer's mountain guiding operation, with her as the company's representative.

An autoinjector is a medical device designed to deliver a single dose of a particular (typically life- saving) drug. Most autoinjectors are spring-loaded syringes. By design, autoinjectors are easy to use and are intended for self-administration by patients. The site of injection depends on the drug loaded, but it typically is administered into the thigh or the buttocks. The injectors were initially designed to overcome the hesitation associated with self-administration of the needle-based drug delivery device. It is the newer delivery vehicle to be used in lieu of the Mark I NAAK.  Purpose  The ATNAA provides atropine and pralidoxime chloride in a single delivery system, although the two drugs are separate within the device.ATNAA Factsheet: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2002/21175_Atnaa_prntlbl.pdf The use of the device is only to be administered in the extreme case of organophosphate poisoning. The delivery system is designed for use by military personnel only, and is only issued to DOD personnel that are considered to be in immediate danger of a chemical attack or work in a position (such as ordnance disposal) where there is a high likelihood of nerve agent exposure.FDA approval process http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2002/21175_Atnaa.cfm  FDA approval  During initial trials and submission to the FDA for approval, the United States Department of Defense requested that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) waive the requirement for a doctor's prescription for the ATNAA device; the rationale being that it would be issued en masse to troops. The waiver request was denied.Pg 59, Bio Pharm PDF document:  Training  As a condition of approval, the FDA lists on the device label the precise instructions that are to be given to military personnel on dosage and administration.See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION within ATNAA Factsheet: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2002/21175_Atnaa_prntlbl.pdf While each branch of the DoD typically provides their own tailored training, an example of the MK I NAAK and ATNAA are referenced in the United States Air Force Self Aid Buddy Care Training (SABC). SABC encompasses basic life support and limb-saving techniques to help wounded or injured personnel survive in medical emergencies until medical help is available.see Training Objectives AFI 36-2238, SABC Training:http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFI36-2238.pdf  References  Further reading  *Meridian Meds: https://web.archive.org/web/20091229175836/http://www.meridianmeds.com/pdf/ATNAA_Pack_Insert.pdf *Landauer, W: Cholinomimetic teratogens.
